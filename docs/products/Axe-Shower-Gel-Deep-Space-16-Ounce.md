      <li>The shower gel works up a nice lather  and smells great.</li>
      <li>Very refreshing.</li>
      <li>With a great smell, this is easily my favorite smelling Axe Shower Gel.  </li>
      <li>But I will admit I bought this soap because the smell was amazing.  </li>
      <li>It comes out smooth, and lathers into a shimmery, metallic smoothness: this shower gel works great, and recommended for manly cleanliness.</li>
      <li>Both of my sons are Axe fans, so I thought I would see how my husband liked it.</li>
      <li>-- It has a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>This smelled like Eucalyptus and I liked that.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and lathers well, so</li>
      <li>I bought this Axe shower gel for my boyfriend, so when ever he takes a shower at my house he has his own shower gel to shower with and doesn&#x27;t have to use mines.</li>
      <li>It smells nice to me.</li>
      <li>I liked the scent of this shower gel.</li>
      <li>I used this product once to honestly say I had tried it.  </li>
      <li>Still a good product with the iconic Axe fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is some great shower gel from Axe, make my body feel clean, refreshed, and nice</li>
      <li>but sometimes you need to smell great and be clean and this works in that regard.</li>
      <li>Good price and easy to find.</li>
      <li>I love Axe, I even use my husbands own.</li>
      <li>The best so far has been the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s better for just a shower gel, but I love the scent, and it does linger nicely.</li>
      <li>Container is cool and description sounded like it would smell good, but my BF ended up smelling like a pine forest.</li>
      <li>I have to say he washes up nicely after using this shower gel and smells nice and clean.</li>
      <li>But I like it, and my wife liked it too, which is pretty good for me.</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to have a powerful fragrance, with a manly smell, which is not the case, and a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, strong but it doesn&#x27;t linger forever.</li>
      <li>I found that it lathered nicely, and rinsed off easily.  </li>
      <li>What more can one say?</li>
      <li>So, I doubt if this product is marketed at my demographic, and I doubt if many middle-aged men will buy it.  </li>
      <li>hope they come up with a body wash of this that is more hair-friendly</li>
      <li>absolutely love the smell.  </li>
      <li>Both Axe shower gels are excellent, but I prefer the Deep Space.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s scent is not overpowering, but it is manly, like most Axe products.  </li>
      <li>now might just be my favorite Axe product.</li>
      <li>kind of like too much cheap cologne, maybe from being concentrated-</li>
      <li>and I believe it gives more cleaning</li>
      <li>but I soon leaned to love it.</li>
      <li>but we are all enjoying it.</li>
      <li>The more I use it, the more I like it, and would buy this scent again.</li>
      <li>My husband uses it the most</li>
      <li>Bugs already bite me and this seemed to attract more bugs.</li>
      <li>The smell was kinda ehhh in comparison to his favorite (and mine)-snake peel.</li>
      <li>I got one for Christmas and had to order more.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and does a nice exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>I love the Axe astronaut campaign.</li>
      <li>the down-side, it does include sodium laureth sulfate, which most shampoos seem to have anyway.  </li>
      <li>I will be buying more</li>
      <li>I did find the scent to be somewhat overpowering (in a good way) when I first opened the bottle, but the aroma was slight-to-non-existent after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>fragrance, suds well, gets you clean in the shower, what more do you</li>
      <li>Way too strong of a smell...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it has a \\&quot;pepperminty\\&quot; smell, which isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a great product and I highly  recommend it for any  guys who is looking for a shower gel that would keep him clean and smells great.</li>
      <li>But the Shower gel is cool and refreshing..</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
      <li>The scent is a bit strong, but not that overpowering when you use it, nor is it the most pleasant scent I have ever used, do not ask me why Deep Space, Chill Out means.  </li>
      <li>This men&#x27;s Axe Shower Gel Deep Space is a great shower gel:</li>
      <li>I prefer a smooth shower gel.</li>
      <li>The gels have changed from being syrup-like to being more viscous and colorful.  </li>
      <li>but it fades as you lather up, becoming pleasant enough and in this summer heat it does make you feel clean.  </li>
      <li>think this would be a good option for those who like lighter scents (or those with parents who prefer less overwhelming smells!), to include women.</li>
      <li>It had a really crisp, fresh fragrance that was manly but nice to be around.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite distinctive and unique.  </li>
      <li>The scent is unique.</li>
      <li>It sure doesn&#x27;t hurt when a few of the women in your life tell how great you smell.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, which is very personal thing, and lasts through most of the day.</li>
      <li>He reports that he likes the scent, it lathers up well and rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>The shower gel is ok, nice scent but very gritty.</li>
      <li>Be clean.</li>
      <li>It seems to lather well and rinse clean without leaving a film on the skin.</li>
      <li>I definitely would say this would be good for anyone who really wants the strength and smell if they are into something that could be out of this world, but it doesn&#x27;t get you feeling a lunar kind of value that is worth its value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of course anytime someone smells good, and is clean, is a plus as appose to the opposite.</li>
      <li>Well as expected the body wash works great and the scent stays with you hours after use.</li>
      <li>Good product overall.</li>
      <li>and I am finding it true with all Axe shower products:&lt;br</li>
      <li>My lady likes it, so that is good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s not a bad product, just does not seem necessary to replace good old-fashioned soap.</li>
      <li>When I first used it, it seemed a bit like I was literally bathing in cologne, but the scent is not as strong after you rinse.  </li>
      <li>When I first smelled it, it wasn&#x27;t an instant favorite, but my wife really liked how it smelled.</li>
      <li>When he step out of the shower he smells so fresh and his skin was so clean.</li>
      <li>My boys love Axe products, the spray in particular.</li>
      <li>own observations reveal that this scent is not as powerful as many of the other Axe products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting from Axe and with a great new scent that is also in many other products in their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My boyfriend was very excited to try this new shower gel by Axe.  </li>
      <li>It has a crisp clean aroma.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said this shower gel is neither and leaves you smelling fresh.  </li>
      <li>Too gritty for my husband, but nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>Plus the exfoliating versions tend to smell better (by better, I mean in my husband&#x27;s sense of the word--which is lighter and not-so overpowering in the perfume department since most men don&#x27;t like that).</li>
      <li>Some of the other Axe scents can smell too much like Cool Waters knock-offs, but this one is surprisingly more sophisticated.</li>
      <li>It is not overpowering, just a nice, comfortable, manly \\&quot;lets sit on a leather sofa and make out\\&quot; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says it is a new scent, \\&quot;unlimited female attention\\&quot; with 2 pictures.  </li>
      <li>Despite the commercial when I put this body gel on I wasn&#x27;t suddenly surrounding by beautiful, bathing suit wearing women.</li>
      <li>The Axe \\&quot;Deep Space\\&quot; body wash is a bit mild in it&#x27;s sandalwood scent but refreshing and contains scrubbing texture crystals too.</li>
      <li>As far as the fragrance, it was pleasant enough.  </li>
      <li>None of us think the smell is too strong and we all enjoy the tiny granules&lt;br /&gt;which</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this product for my husband. Both of my sons are Axe fans, so I thought I would see how my husband liked it. He loved it. It had a really crisp, fresh fragrance that was manly but nice to be around. And just a little dab will do you. LOL I would definitely consider putting this in a gift basket for one of the men in my life in the future. I just don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any of the Axe products though. [[ASIN:B00ARCQHBC Axe Shower Gel Deep Space, 16 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This smelled like Eucalyptus and I liked that.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great. I got one for Christmas and had to order more. The weird thing is that the way they sell it here on Amazon is that it&#x27;s $3.97 individually OR $15.00 for three. Whaaaa?</li>
    <li> My boys love Axe products, the spray in particular. I think the spray is too strong and can smell it long after they have left the house. I bought them this hoping it would keep them from using the spray. It smells nice, strong but it doesn&#x27;t linger forever. If they use this they don&#x27;t layer with the spray (thank heavens). It has a crisp clean aroma. I can tolerate it, and it does not trigger a migraine in me. It seems to lather well and rinse clean without leaving a film on the skin.</li>
    <li> A lot of the items we get from Amazon Vine that we like we don&#x27;t like enough to add to our shopping consideration. This one smells fresh and seals tightly when stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will continue buying</li>
    <li> I got a leaked bottle, So only half was left in the bottle before i start using it. But the Shower gel is cool and refreshing..</li>
    <li> The fragrance is amazing and this is all I have used to bathe myself for the past year.  It smells fantastic and does a nice exfoliation.  I feel it&#x27;s REALLY expensive here considering I can go down the street to Walmart and get it for less than half the price.  While I feel like avoiding Wally World at all cost might be worth it; my financial sense just can&#x27;t make the justification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.walmart.com/ip/AXE-Deep-Space-Chill-Out-Shower-Gel-16-fl-oz/23711644</li>
    <li> Being a science fiction fan, I like outer space, so it would be only natural for me to want this. Another reason that I like this is because it has a very faint coconut fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by Axe products (as proven by some of my previous reviews) but neither he, nor I was really feeling Deep Space. The smell was kinda ehhh in comparison to his favorite (and mine)-snake peel. My suggestion, if you&#x27;re going for the Axe body wash for men, go for their exfoliating versions (let&#x27;s face it, this is the only way we get a rough-skinned men to exfoliate). Plus the exfoliating versions tend to smell better (by better, I mean in my husband&#x27;s sense of the word--which is lighter and not-so overpowering in the perfume department since most men don&#x27;t like that).</li>
    <li> Too gritty for my husband, but nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> The least good Axe body wash I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not a great scent. I&#x27;d recommend other varieties.</li>
    <li> The shower gel is ok, nice scent but very gritty.</li>
    <li> I have purchased about a half dozen Axe products and this Deep Space Shower Gel is by far the best. The smell is great!&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the smell as coconut/sandalwood. 5 stars - would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> smells awesome&lt;br /&gt;got gritty stuff, like pumice hand soap!&lt;br /&gt;feels GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;MAN SOAP!&lt;br /&gt;(ape noises and grunting ensue with a bit of chest pounding)</li>
    <li> Yuck. Container is cool and description sounded like it would smell good, but my BF ended up smelling like a pine forest. He also said it didn&#x27;t lather very well. Had to go out and buy him his &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; shower gel.</li>
    <li> all joking aside, it&#x27;s a good product, By &#x27;smells like christmas&#x27;, well, that was just my initial scent memory for it.. a 1980&#x27;s christmas in fact..something slightly pine-y, slightly rosemary-ish; and a clean, soapy scent which I can only describe as &#x27;freshly opened plastic toy&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably toxic, sure, but it smells great going on and lingers a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they come up with a body wash of this that is more hair-friendly, this has a slight grit to it that&#x27;s better for just a shower gel, but I love the scent, and it does linger nicely.</li>
    <li> Way too strong of a smell... I would never buy it again. Again, it was a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; so I grabbed it.</li>
    <li> My son loves Axe products, so I ordered AXE SHOWER GEL DEEP SPACE for him. Of course, I had to try it as well. I was expecting it to have a powerful fragrance, with a manly smell, which is not the case, and a pleasant surprise. Several of the Axe products I have smelled were overpowering, producing the opposite affect I imagine they intended it too. Anytime I encounter a person who has such a powerful scent, I have to wonder what they are attempting to hide. The gel itself is milky in color with a shin to it. While lathering, you can feel the little bead like contents that provides a mild scrubbing action. The fragrant last for a time, but not for long, which can be a plus if you don&#x27;t care for it to clash with your perfume or cologne. However, I don&#x27;t buy into the statement that someone would attract the opposite sex due to using this product. Of course anytime someone smells good, and is clean, is a plus as appose to the opposite.</li>
    <li> While it humors me to watch AXE pump out product after product aimed at the primping, pimple-popping prepubescent male populace, I&#x27;ve got to admit they&#x27;ve introduced a solid line of products that males of any age can appreciate ... including this 40-something.  Axe&#x27;s DEEP SPACE CHILL OUT offers yet another option among their ever-expanding collection of shower gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I happen upon a new Axe shower gel or shampoo fragrance, I give it a try.  One thing I&#x27;ve noticed over the years is that the shower gels have considerably evolved in terms of scent, color and texture.  The gels have changed from being syrup-like to being more viscous and colorful.  DEEP SPACE is pearl colored and slightly granular.  I found the scrubbing quality of the granulation subtle and pleasant ... you DO NOT feel like you&#x27;re slathering your body with Go-Jo.  Axe shower gels always rinse cleanly and DEEP SPACE is no exception.  Some users may experience an ever-so-slight tingling on their skin from the eucalyptus and black pepper (yes, pepper), but nothing akin to the intensity of Axe&#x27;s menthol Shock shower gel.  I did find the scent to be somewhat overpowering (in a good way) when I first opened the bottle, but the aroma was slight-to-non-existent after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked DEEP SPACE simply because it does what it is intended to do ... clean.  The multitude of new scents offered by Axe is somewhat gimmicky because, in the end, the scent goes down the drain when the gel is rinsed off (only the deodorant/anti-perspirant scents tend to \\&quot;hang around\\&quot; for a while).  Regardless, I like the initial aroma and the tinge of skin-tingle it offers.  While DEEP SPACE probably won&#x27;t generate the \\&quot;harem of hotties\\&quot; it alludes, you can rest assure the gals won&#x27;t be running away, plugging their noses, either.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend was very excited to try this new shower gel by Axe.  It smells awesome and is long lasting just like any other Axe product \\&quot;BUT\\&quot; once he started to lather this product on his skin, he immediately noticed unexpected sand-like scrubs. Looking at the bottle again afterwards, it is not labeled as a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel great to scrub your back, feet and legs with this shower gel, but it is too harsh on other sensitive area like neck, armpits, inner thigh, genitals, etc.  This product should be listed as a scrub, not as a shower gel.</li>
    <li> When I first smelled it, it wasn&#x27;t an instant favorite, but my wife really liked how it smelled. It has hints of woodsy aromas and is spicy. There are also small beads to aid in exfoliating. The more I use it, the more I like it, and would buy this scent again. Some of the other Axe scents can smell too much like Cool Waters knock-offs, but this one is surprisingly more sophisticated.</li>
    <li> 16 oz hard plastic bottle about 9 inches high, seems well suited for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a woman&#x27;s perspective -- It has a nice scent.  Although it smells a little strong right out of the bottle, it leaves a nice \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent behind after washing with it and rinsing it off.  It is not overpowering, just a nice, comfortable, manly \\&quot;lets sit on a leather sofa and make out\\&quot; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says it is a new scent, \\&quot;unlimited female attention\\&quot; with 2 pictures.  The first is a guy showering with this product.  The second is a guy with a girl and the girl is wrapped in a towel.  Cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down-side, it does include sodium laureth sulfate, which most shampoos seem to have anyway.  My 40-year old son did not like this particular scent as much as some of the other Axe scents, but he is using the bottle I gave him.  For me, I would not turn my nose up at a guy wearing it.  It smells nice to me.</li>
    <li> &amp;lt;&amp;lt;Squeeze out gel. Lather on body. Rinse off. Be clean. Smell great.&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I think I can manage that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent from the bottle is a little... odd.  I dunno- kind of like too much cheap cologne, maybe from being concentrated- but it fades as you lather up, becoming pleasant enough and in this summer heat it does make you feel clean.  So yeah, it&#x27;s does like it says- which is all you can ever ask for.</li>
    <li> Axe Shower Gel Deep Space, 16 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Category: Bath &amp; Body&lt;br /&gt;Nice fragrance, suds well, gets you clean in the shower, what more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for men who take a shower (as opposed to a tub bath)&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  April 2013</li>
    <li> I love the Axe astronaut campaign. The Axe \\&quot;Deep Space\\&quot; body wash is a bit mild in it&#x27;s sandalwood scent but refreshing and contains scrubbing texture crystals too. I dig the spa ing container, it suits the ads and chrome look of the soap itself.</li>
    <li> I liked the scent of this shower gel. I&#x27;d say it has a \\&quot;pepperminty\\&quot; smell, which isn&#x27;t too strong. What more can one say? Now, I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I did have two problems with it. The first is the little dissolving beads. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of those. I prefer a smooth shower gel. The second problem is that it left my hands feeling a bit dry after using it, which is not a problem I have with the one I regularly use (Softsoap for Men).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad product, and I&#x27;ll use up the rest of the bottle. But I&#x27;ll stick to the one I&#x27;m already using, because I&#x27;m not a fan of the dissolving beads in my shower gel or dry hands after use.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about trying this Axe shower gel, as I find Axe products to be obnoxiously over fragranced and an irritating ad campaign that seems to appeal to morons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said this shower gel is neither and leaves you smelling fresh.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting from Axe and with a great new scent that is also in many other products in their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shower gel does not get that foamy, but I am guessing that is why they call it a shower gel and not a body wash.</li>
    <li> Never sure about the chick magnet quality of the product but sometimes you need to smell great and be clean and this works in that regard.</li>
    <li> This is some great shower gel from Axe, make my body feel clean, refreshed, and nice smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I just put some on my shower tool and scrub away!&lt;br /&gt;This now might just be my favorite Axe product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Axe personal care products for years. This new fragrance was at first a little different but I soon leaned to love it. It sure doesn&#x27;t hurt when a few of the women in your life tell how great you smell. As with all of the Axe products, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for about a month now. The scent is unique. It can come off as a little to powerful when you&#x27;re using it, to just right when you&#x27;re all dry and dressed. Very refreshing. It cleans as well as it smells. No complaints at all on quality of this soap. The only gripe I have, and it&#x27;s trivial, is the cap. I know its supposed to be a space aged design, but I really like a flat cap so I can place it upside down on my shower shelf. Yep, that trivial. Good product overall.</li>
    <li> I love Axe, I even use my husbands own. Smells nice and lathers well, so I will be buying more</li>
    <li> Good price and easy to find. Not available at my local Walmart or target.</li>
    <li> I would never think I would be an Axe supporter because I don&#x27;t like the stereotypical &amp;#34;Bro&amp;#34; they use in their marketing.  But I will admit I bought this soap because the smell was amazing.  I am a guy who likes a thick lather with a nice aroma in my morning soap.  The lather is surprising with just a small amount so it goes a long way.  Non-bro approved!</li>
    <li> When I first revived this product in the mail, I initially put the package unopened on the kitchen table, after an hour the whole kitchen had a very strong scent that was starting to drift into adjoining rooms.  When I finally opened it up, even though the container itself was wrapped plastic, a wall of smell rushed over me.  When I opened up the plastic, I understand why it was double wrapped, it was leaking.  But the cap was not accidentally open in transit, the bottle is so poorly designed, that some will leak out if it is on its side, which of course will happen if you have it shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash is your slightly above average body wash.  The scent is a bit strong, but not that overpowering when you use it, nor is it the most pleasant scent I have ever used, do not ask me why Deep Space, Chill Out means.  I do like that it has the micro-beads that helps give you that extra clean.  If you like other Axe products, you may want to give a try at wherever you buy beauty products in a brick and mortar store, but do not buy this over the internet because the design alone will guarantee that it will leak.</li>
    <li> When it has came down to Axe body products, they haven&#x27;t been able to prove more for both sexes, but tried so hard to be butch for men. Axe Shower Gel has tried so much to make strong body care products, but they have definitely lost their luster at times. Their Deep Space Shower gel, delivers a musky smell that can overpower you after a shower or bath. I really found this shower gel to not be as sensitive to the skin unlike other body wash brands like Degree and Old Spice. I definitely would say this would be good for anyone who really wants the strength and smell if they are into something that could be out of this world, but it doesn&#x27;t get you feeling a lunar kind of value that is worth its value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength &amp; Value: C+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: C 1/2+</li>
    <li> Which is something I never thought I would say about an Axe product.  Axe Shower Gel Deep Space, 16 Ounce, has a scent with hints of black pepper, eucalyptus, and sandalwood (according to the package).  I smell the eucalyptus and the pepper, but the sandalwood is quite subtle to my nose.  The scent is not overwhelming, as I find many of the Axe scents-it&#x27;s actually quite light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is opalescent white, with little gritty exfoliating bits in it.  I found that it lathered nicely, and rinsed off easily.  The lather cleansed well, assisted by the gritty stuff, removing green stains from mowing the lawn from my body easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a good option for those who like lighter scents (or those with parents who prefer less overwhelming smells!), to include women.</li>
    <li> this covers any bad smell from going to gym or sports. It lasts 24 hours literally. Sometimes. I avoid it. I like non-scented ones. Bugs already bite me and this seemed to attract more bugs. Maybe it will work for someone else. But as product goes. It covers any smell or body odor.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Axe Deep Space scent and likes this body wash a lot! None of us think the smell is too strong and we all enjoy the tiny granules&lt;br /&gt;which exfoliate your skin gently. My husband uses it the most but we are all enjoying it. I expect we will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My lady likes it, so that is good enough for me.  I did not find the fragrance to be too overpowering, but she said she could get a whiff of it when she walked into my office.  She says it has a slight musky scent.  When I first used it, it seemed a bit like I was literally bathing in cologne, but the scent is not as strong after you rinse.  Of all of the AXE shower gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried (3 or so), she likes this the best, so I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I used this product once to honestly say I had tried it.  Then I gave it to my husband to continue to use and test out for me.&lt;br /&gt;I found the texture strange and unpleasant.  My husband loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the smell.  It is inviting and definitely manly!&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I do not like and I am finding it true with all Axe shower products:&lt;br /&gt;They leave a filmy build up on the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine the same is true for the body they are used on.&lt;br /&gt;If that were not the case, this product would rate a 5.</li>
    <li> I enjoy jumping around and trying different body washes. The Axe brand is one of my favorites. This one has a pepper-ish smell to it and the smell really doesn&#x27;t linger long on your body like most other Axe washes do. That can be good or bad depending on your preference. This feels like it has grains in it but not thick enough to exfoliate your skin or stick on you when you&#x27;re rinsing.</li>
    <li> Smells good and seems to last long then a bottle of Old Spice body wash lasts me.</li>
    <li> I bought this Axe shower gel for my boyfriend, so when ever he takes a shower at my house he has his own shower gel to shower with and doesn&#x27;t have to use mines. I have to say he washes up nicely after using this shower gel and smells nice and clean. The shower gel works up a nice lather  and smells great. When he step out of the shower he smells so fresh and his skin was so clean. Overall this is a great product and I highly  recommend it for any  guys who is looking for a shower gel that would keep him clean and smells great.</li>
    <li> With a great smell, this is easily my favorite smelling Axe Shower Gel.  I like the look of both the liquid and the bottle, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback to using this product is the existence of the &amp;#34;beads,&amp;#34; personally.  They feel unnatural and uncomfortable. Still a good product with the iconic Axe fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Axe products for a few years now.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different kinds, and like variety.  I use them in my shower at home, as well as carry some with me in my gym bag or backpack when I work out.  I do like \\&quot;Deep Space\\&quot;, but not as well as most of the other scents.  It&#x27;s a gel, so the same consistency and texture as all the others, but it has a more chemical-ly smell (difficult to described).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional note is that the Axe products that have this kind of top don&#x27;t do well for travel, in gym bags, or being shipped to your house :( The top gets depressed far too easily when it is even minimally jostled, so expect leakage if you are doing anything other than keeping it in your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ones I like better include Excite and Dark Temptation.</li>
    <li> Despite the commercial when I put this body gel on I wasn&#x27;t suddenly surrounding by beautiful, bathing suit wearing women. So maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for me. That said it does work well as soap. It smells nice, which is very personal thing, and lasts through most of the day. I work mostly inside at my current assignment so I don&#x27;t know how it hold up to all day activity and sweat. But I like it, and my wife liked it too, which is pretty good for me.</li>
    <li> My fourteen year old son enjoys many Axe products and was eager to try this Deep Space Shower Gel.  He reports that he likes the scent, it lathers up well and rinses clean.  Aside from the smirk on his face when I pointed out the graphic on the back which indicated the guaranteed girl appeal, that&#x27;s all I could get out of him.  He&#x27;s used it consistently for the past few days and experienced no adverse skin reactions, so this Axe product joins the others we&#x27;ve tried as a solid win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own observations reveal that this scent is not as powerful as many of the other Axe products.  It&#x27;s quite distinctive and unique.  The appearance of the gel certainly gives it an outer space appeal, with its shimmery white color.  As with most other Axe products, my husband feels that the scent is too strong.  As for unlimited girl appeal, time will tell.  Maybe in a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I have tried several shower gels in the past few months. The best so far has been the [[ASIN:B00AO4E9L8 Axe Shower Gel Apollo, 16 Ounce]]. I liked the sudsing action, the small scrubbing solids in the liquid, and the menthol-like scent of the soap. I also liked the easy rinse of the gel off of my skin without much residue, that slick soap feeling. This time, I am reporting on the Axe Deep Space \\&quot;Chill Out\\&quot; Shower Gel. It has the good features of the Apollo of great sudsing and scrubbing solids, but it has a concentrated pine scent instead of menthol. Also, the Deep Space has a clear bottle so you can see how much of the Milky Way colored gel is left. The formula used for the Deep Space is even better than the Apollo for rinsing off the skin. One result of this is that the pine scent does not last quite as long as the menthol scent of the Apollo. That&#x27;s fine with me. Both Axe shower gels are excellent, but I prefer the Deep Space.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. it&#x27;s not liquified , Works really well. I like the granules in the soap which feels good and I believe it gives more cleaning</li>
    <li> I have been an avid user of Axe products since I tried their body spray 4 years ago. They have a very diverse line of products and scents. Recently I tried their body wash and was a fan so I was anxious to try their newest scent Deep Space. I had seen the ads on television and in magazines so I was curious. Well as expected the body wash works great and the scent stays with you hours after use. My only problem is with the scent itself. It is a stronger scent than I would prefer but I have received compliments so I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent and feel of this new member of the Axe family of products:Axe Deep Space Shower Gel. The new scent of black pepper, eucalyptus and sandalwood is just amazing combining to smell sort of like an expensive department store cologne, it is different from the other scents very fresh smelling. It also has little micro beads that give you a deeper kind of clean feeling. I love this shower gel, great job Axe!</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s Axe Shower Gel Deep Space is a great shower gel: it&#x27;s scent is not overpowering, but it is manly, like most Axe products.  It comes out smooth, and lathers into a shimmery, metallic smoothness: this shower gel works great, and recommended for manly cleanliness.</li>
    <li> Axe Shower Gel \\&quot;Deep Space\\&quot; variety did not exactly send me through the stratosphere into deep space, but it appeared to work okay at cleaning, although probably not quite as well as a bar of soap, which is a lot more concentrated than a gel ever could be. As far as the fragrance, it was pleasant enough.  The tiny scrubbing abrasive grains was an added bonus as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am a happily married man at the age of 53, I don&#x27;t care much for the marketing strategy of the Deep Space shower gel where it promises me that I will become the center of every beautiful woman&#x27;s universe.  Let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;m at the age of Dial soap and Head and Shoulders shampoo. So, I doubt if this product is marketed at my demographic, and I doubt if many middle-aged men will buy it.  Still, it&#x27;s not a bad product, just does not seem necessary to replace good old-fashioned soap.</li>
