<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product worked just like I thought it would !</li>
    <li> Very good wahl peanut professional brand trimmer &amp;Clipper . Just wat I was lookin for! Way better price than sally&#x27;s store&#x27;s</li>
    <li> it does its job. wish it came with a bag.. i already lost one of the sizes</li>
    <li> exceeded expectations....beard fine hard to shave due to being fine..now 1st time in years got my face and neck clean thank God</li>
    <li> Great little clippers, very sharp and motor is strong.  These seem to be high quality</li>
    <li> Excellent, It is much more then I expected and very easy to use. Sharp and very clean shaves and trimming beards couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Delivered very fast. I&#x27;ve had peanut before excellent product</li>
    <li> It is almost like electrical razor...</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift and the person seemed to like it, so no complaints</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s called a peanut and that&#x27;s basically what it is. The power was mediocre... I mean it made a lot of noise and it moved fast, but the cutting and the precision was very weak. Andis is a lot better! This clipper really is not low enough to line hair.  Give it to the elephants,</li>
    <li> Good product, value is there and makes a great tool to keep or maintain or trim to your preferred haircut.</li>
    <li> I bought these trimmers to replace a cordless Andis that died after many years. I should have danced with the one that brung me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the guard on, this does a great job trimming my beard. I have to remove the guard to trim around my mouth and mustache. That is what caused the two star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is so powerful, it could be used to winch a Jeep from the mud. Touching around your lips without a guard vibrates so violently that it tickles too much to trim except in short strokes. Worst of all, I angled it to get around the corner of my mouth and drew blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the cord always on the wrong side of my hand and always in the way. I did not lower the rating because of this because I&#x27;m used to a cordless and it may be a feature of a corded model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too late to return it so I&#x27;ll donate it to the girl who cuts my hair. Maybe in the hands of a pro.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ll go shop for a good cordless model with a reasonably powered motor.</li>
    <li> No it did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about 6 or more of these clippers over the years.  I have a small group of people that I cover but this clippers is great for the detail work.  I usually get a couple years out of one.</li>
    <li> Best clipper of this size and price hands down. It&#x27;s very strong, cuts super close and it&#x27;s a breeze to clean. buy it NOW.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product to trim my beard for at least the last 5 years. With in the last five years I have only had to replace the clipper 2 times.  One time because I plugged it into the wrong wall socket in China 220v which caused the motor to burn, that was a user mistake that being said the other time I had to replace the peanut was because I left it in a hotel room.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Close Trim (Size 1,2,3,4 attachments)&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely Durable&lt;br /&gt;-Light weight and portable&lt;br /&gt;-Plugs in so power isn&#x27;t an issue&lt;br /&gt;-Quality construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wont&#x27; be disappointed with this product and I highly recommend Wahl Professional Peanut Clipper!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great little shaver that cuts almost as close as a razor... I liked it so much that I purchased another one for travel</li>
    <li> Bought this based on everybody&#x27;s review and I&#x27;m quite disappointed. Been cutting my own hair (a flat-top haircut) for almost 20 years, and using full-sized trimmers. The thought of using something light and smaller was quite attractive to me, because the full-sized trimmers can be a bit a workout after holding them in the air for 30 minutes or so. Anyway, I should have know better. These are certainly lighter and smaller, but they do not do a very good job at cutting. They&#x27;re also quite loud and \\&quot;buzzy\\&quot; (as is vibrations). Anyway, I&#x27;m glad these weren&#x27;t too expensive, because they&#x27;ll likely sit in my cabinet un-used.</li>
    <li> this has some serious power for a little trimmer</li>
    <li> my son was very happy when he received it.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> It started making noises in 1st two weeks</li>
    <li> Comes with a kit of add-ons, but I only use it with the standard blade as-shown to provide a slight stubble look every couple days, as this product was recommended to me for. Handy for quick sideburn and eyebrow trims too. Only con is that the shavings go everywhere- no container to empty. Works well, is versatile, has good build quality, can&#x27;t argue with the price. Great value.</li>
    <li> Have owned for several years now and it is still going strong. Definitely recommend the corded version</li>
    <li> this is exactly the product that i was looking for . i could not be happier .... and i received it earlier than promised ..</li>
    <li> I bought these for my friend who cuts hair professionally, and she loves them - at least for cutting my hair which is short and straight.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is great. It cut my hair close to my skin. It is exactly what I was looking for in a hair trimmer. The price was right too.</li>
    <li> Very noisy and the cap fall apart easily.</li>
    <li> Perfect little trimmer.  I cut my boy&#x27;s hair every couple of weeks and always tend to knick their ears with our full-size trimmers.  These make the job SO MUCH EASIER.  The edges of the blade are rounded on both ends so my bows hardly feel a scratch when I am trimming around their ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are smaller than expected and that is a good thing!  There are few products (of any type) that are just a joy to use.  This little peanut is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to comment with any questions.</li>
    <li> good machine, excellent product, I recommend</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Light without as much vibration sensation.  Much better than standard sized clippers.</li>
    <li> Did everything it said it would</li>
    <li> They did not trim as expected....and are to little to hold firmly in you hand</li>
    <li> Great item but gets a little hot.</li>
    <li> Wahl Professional 8655-200 Peanut Clipper/trimmer, Black&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Diya Mall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned about buying this product since I once had a crappy Wahl ear/nose trimmer that wouldn&#x27;t pass a second grader&#x27;s inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am very happy that I purchased this trimmer. Like others here, I got tired of replacing the rechargable trimmers every two or three years. This has plenty of power for my beard and other parts. I&#x27;ve only had it for 7 months, but keepin&#x27; it clean and oiled as per instructions and so far it&#x27;s stayed plenty sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really could use a case, though. Right now I have it in a rather inconvenient zip lock bag.</li>
    <li> This is the second Peanut trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. The first one I purchased back in 05. Still works, but is showing signs of getting tired. It has hands down beat any beard trimmer I have owned in the past. This new one seems like it trims a little closer than it&#x27;s predecessor. Take care of them and they last.</li>
    <li> Trimmer was ship to me extremely fast. I am very impressed with how quickly I received it. The trimmer works better than expected.</li>
    <li> I use this clipper strictly on my face as I use the balding clipper for my head. This is my second peanut, first on died after seven years. I bought two this time as my son keeps stealing mine. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a five o&#x27;clock shadow styled bead or to bald the scalp.</li>
    <li> This Whal Peanut clipper was more than I expected.  Its a small and mighty clipper.  Its powerful, has great attachments and it was easy for me to clean.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a very nice item</li>
    <li> My wife has arthritis in her hands &amp; finds it painful to use our regular size &amp; weight hair clipper so when I saw the Wahl peanut on Amazon, we gave it a try.  It cuts very well with good power. It&#x27;s small size actually makes for easier trimming aroung the ears. Some reviews said that it is \\&quot;buzzy\\&quot; but we do not find that to be so.&lt;br /&gt;All in all we are well pleased &amp; plan to buy another one for our weekend home.</li>
    <li> Use it as a trimmer.  Suggested by my stylist. More product than I really need but is well worth the price</li>
    <li> I used an original Peanut model for years which I enjoyed a lot until the unit was wearing out. I ordered this black model and I don&#x27;t like how fat the handle is and the blades were dirty on a supposedly new product. I also don&#x27;t like that the blade head is recessed so far back on the unit where the handle thickness can get in the way when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three of the guides also had scratches all over them. I was going to send it back to the seller I purchased it from but they only had the white and I preferred the black. I needed the trimmer so I just dealt with it. I kind of wish I just sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Peanut could use a more streamlined revision with better placement of the blade head like on the original model.</li>
    <li> great purchase and love the way it fits in hand.</li>
    <li> Received on time and the item was great!</li>
    <li> You will want to trim every hair in your body after you get this little thing, so be careful! I almost went for my eyebrows but a voice inside me asked me if I was crazy.. LOL.. this trimmer works wonders, fits anywhere for storage, and with the attachments/accessories it&#x27;s just perfect for any kind of trimming job. Plus it&#x27;s very confortable to use with the ring and everything. I liked it so much that I bought a second one as a present for a colleague. This trimmer is a MUST HAVE for any man.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for an identical model.  My son uses it to trim his beard, and liked it so much he wanted the exact same model.  The old one lasted 5 years.</li>
    <li> We have been using the peanut by wahl for many years and simply wear them out.  This one is just so adorable and love that it now is in black. This is the best and this vendor had the best price.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I may never shave again.  The peanut can get my beard down to just a shadow, without any damage to the skin.  The strong motor and sharp blades have no trouble with my scruff.  If you hate shaving, consider a peanut.</li>
    <li> so much better than my regular clippers. I use this for my entire head and it does the trick just fine.</li>
    <li> I Love these clippers!  The product shipped fast. This clipper is precise and does a great job on my clients. I would definitely purchase from this company again!</li>
    <li> I bought this after two cordless beard trimmers. They lacked the power and endurance to do a good job keeping my beard in shape. What this lacks in convenience because of the cord, is made up by the power of the clippers, and fact that they don&#x27;t run out of charge. I love the way these work, and the low (almost no) maintenance required. These clippers are awesome.</li>
    <li> Wahl hit it out of the park with these trimmers, excellent precision.</li>
    <li> Wahl peanut is really an excellent hairclipper. In the past, I have used a few hairclippers but this cuts far better without any kind of uneveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also easy to hold and the functioning too is excellent. Now its been 1 week since I brought this clipper and have to say that this clipper is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is fine for beard trimming, but it seems a bit undersized for a full head of not-already-short hair. That said, my wife gave me an excellent (albeit a bit too short) haircut with it after I&#x27;d grown my hair out for several months.</li>
    <li> I blew up my first peanut which was white.  I had plugged it into 220.  Don&#x27;t do that.  But I use my peanut to shave a few times a week and also to cut my own hair.  So I went onto amazon and got this black one.  Seems ok so far.</li>
    <li> The peanut does what it needs to do. I sometimes have to go over areas a few times but I&#x27;m not a barber. It&#x27;s light and the kids love the buzzing sound. I have dropped it about four feet high. It came undone and I was able to snap it together. Other than that, it&#x27;s been reliable for the past two years I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
    <li> My exgirlfriend was a hair stylist and showed me this trimmer and it&#x27;s been an awesome tool! I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard for 40 years and have used every manufacture out there. Wahl is the only one worth buying and this is the best. It replaces a Wahl cordless. Eventually thre cordless batteries wear out and since they can not be replaced, the unit starts to pull rather than cut. This corded peanut isjust as easy to use and is twice as fast.</li>
    <li> Item met all customer expectations.</li>
    <li> I really like my Peanut trimmer.  It is powerful, far better than battery powered trimmers.  It&#x27;s compact and light weight.  So, it&#x27;s easy to trim behind ears and to trim your mustache or goatee. My only complaint is that the attachments do not include a 1/16\\&quot; and blending guide.  I tend to trim my beard closer than the smallest guide provided which appears to be 1/8\\&quot;.  So, I still have to use my full size clippers to do a full trim down to the level I prefer.</li>
    <li> This cuts my hair fast and without any pull. Allows me to get a short precise cut that I can do myself. Works great!</li>
    <li> Great little machine . . .</li>
    <li> MY ORDERSSHIPPED AND ARRIVED A DAY BEFORE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO AND I WAS VERY EXCITED TO USE MY NEW PRODUCT AND WHEN I DID I WAS VERY PLEASED....ONLY THING IS I WISH I CAME WITH A BAG OR CONTAINER TO PUT THE SMALL PIECES IN AFTER YOU OPEN THE PLASTIC CONTAINER.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my peanut for about. 7 years. Cut my own hair every 3 weeks. Perfect product. I have the white color and still looks new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I&#x27;ve never taken this apart to clean it. Never sprayed anything on it to keep it running smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick hair/beard and still runs like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bigger size clipper from WAHL and can only recommend their products with praise.</li>
    <li> This is not as good as the highter price ones, but for the money the kit is very good.</li>
    <li> I am wicked happy with the peanut! After buying tons of different clippers from various companies,nothing comes close to the peanut.</li>
    <li> Worked just as I was told it would. Works super.</li>
    <li> The blade on this unit comes off very easily and the plastic that holds the blade securely breaks off very easily. I have lost one blade when i used it overseas so i ended up trashing it. Bought another one in white when i returned. It worked perfectly but then the blade is coming off again. Buying a replacement blade costs half of the unit itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance wise it is amazing, does the job very well. I wish Wahl would&#x27;ve secured the blade in place with a screw instead of plastic, hopefully the engineers would take note of this.</li>
    <li> This is a great beard trimmer, it is better than any I have tried, except it doesn&#x27;t have as many lengths as I would like. The cutting power is something to behold, way better than any battery powered one you could buy. I have the 50 dollar phillips norelco and the beard length adjuster never worked properly. It would cut shorter or longer depending on how I angled the trimmer. This has the tried and true attachment system so you now it&#x27;s going to cut the same length every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have your standard short stubble attachment, then a light full beard (number 2), then a medium length full beard (number 3) and then a long one number 4. There is no adjustments for anything in between, so if you&#x27;re really particular about the length of your beard, I would go with the philips norelco, just don&#x27;t get the 50 dollar &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; one, it sucks.</li>
    <li> Love this Wahl Peanut, my dad had the older one (from about ten years ago) and it lasted so long that he upgraded to this new one but in white, I followed and bought mines but in black. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase I use this peanut to shave every other day and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blown away by the WAHL PEANUT HAIR TRIMMER! When I received it I was surprised by the compact size and thought there&#x27;s no way that this thing is going to be able to trim my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m wearing a Mohawk style with my hair long on top and tapered into a point in the back with the sides shaved down to 1/4-inch and I have thick and coarse hair, so I figured that the PEANUT would get clogged fast and I&#x27;d have to stop and clear it constantly -- but I was in for a shock. It cut right through with no jamming, stopping, or any other issue. It sounds like a hummingbird and glides along just as easily through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfectly in the palm of my hand and the smaller size makes it easy to hold and control. The shaver head is about 2/3 smaller in width than a regular trimmer head (maybe slightly smaller) and I find that the compact head makes it easier to get a more detailed trim. The guards snap on and off easily and they make trimming really simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the PEANUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 4-guards, 1-protector head cover, 1-cleaning brush, 1-tiny bottle of clipper oil, and instruction sheet. Also, the clam-shell like package opens and closes so you can store it in the package for safe keeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to buy another one just in-case they stop making it, so I&#x27;ll always have a spare.</li>
    <li> After reading multiple (over 20) reviews on 20 plus clippers, I came to realization that everyones head and face are different.  This is a very nice shaver for those of us that are not overly fussy with how short or long our beards are.  It only has 4 attachments, so you need to know that it will clip very nicely to those heights, Period.  It does not have a battery to die or take forever to charge and you cannot use it in the shower.  It is a very good, light unit that will do what it is designed for.  The cord is approximately 6 feet long.</li>
    <li> This thing is the best trimmer ever. Was skeptical because of it size and it being wired but the performance blew me away. 10/10 would recommend</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this buzzer, so I tried it. I am extremely happy. Unfortunatly I&#x27;m going bald so I needed a buzzer to buzz my head and this works great. the blades move very fast which gives you a clean cut. I own a few types of buzzers, trimmer,clippers, whatever you want to call them, and this is the best one. It was about $35.00.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your choice.</li>
    <li> I came home saturday night to find three pair of my best clippers broken and chewed up by my dogs so I was forced to buy some more. I&#x27;ve been using Andis trimmers and the Oyster Fast Feed&#x27;s for years and love them both but the Andis trimmers do get pretty hot after a while. So naturally I came on here to check out the reviews for new trimmers and I went with the Wahl Peanut. They do a good job of trimming my beard down to the length I want but when I tried to use it to shave my face it nicked me three times. To me they feel like toy trimmers compared to the Andis outliners. I couldn&#x27;t take these trimmers serious, it felt like I was using nose hair trimmers for my face.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome...compact...corded trimmer.</li>
    <li> Small, powerful, does a great job. Can&#x27;t use a regular power adaptor overseas, it will blow up, need a converter.</li>
    <li> Great little clippers.</li>
    <li> I used this to trim my beard. It does a very good job, it is powerful and quick.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the longest trimmer attachment is 1/2 inch.  Wish there was a 3/4 or 1 inch attachment.</li>
    <li> 5 stars ~I use it to shave first and it makes shaving with a razor easy and saves me money by enabling me to re-use the razors over and over~This trimmer is excellent for grooming your moustache and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Brad Jackson</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer and comfortable in hand .Very pleased!</li>
    <li> my husband love this trimmer he had one but broke it ,tried to replace with a different brand no comparison</li>
    <li> I was happy when I saw these to purchase. I have my own salon and these flippers are a good item to have without all the weight. They work and do the job very well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming my facial hair.:) All I use it for and really don&#x27;t like shaving off my beard.:(</li>
    <li> Trimmer works as advertised</li>
    <li> I began using our [[ASIN:B00011K2BA original Peanut]] many years ago, when we chipped in with my mother in law to purchase an [[ASIN:B000LRN31K Oster A5 2-Speed Clipper]] for grooming the 4 dogs between us -- the Peanut came free as a \\&quot;bonus item\\&quot; with our purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peanut looks and feels cheap, but got an unsolicited thumbs up from my barber when I was talking about dog grooming with him. And over the years, I really came to appreciate the Peanut&#x27;s small #30 blade for the tricky spots where the large Oster A5 blades wouldn&#x27;t work: paws, face, and nether regions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peanut reliably cut into the nooks and crannies between the dogs&#x27; foot pads, around loose skin under the chin, and in the sensitive belly region without a nick or cut, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ran quietly, not frightening the animals like the big Oster, and maintenance was minimal: a brief dip in Oster Blade Cleaner and a drip of oil to keep everything running smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I dropped the original Peanut square on its blade onto the hard concrete patio last week. Its plastic construction wasn&#x27;t up to the fall, and snapped in a few places, revealing its rather unsubstantial construction. Nevertheless, I can&#x27;t fault the Peanut for failing in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very close to ordering another Peanut as a replacement, but first looked around a bit and instead selected an [[ASIN:B000RFS118 Andis Outliner II Personal Trimmer]], hoping it would be a better value due to metal construction and better materials and blades.  However, now with the Andis in hand, I can still recommend the Peanut due to its smaller size (the blade is slightly narrower, and the shaver itself is smaller), its lighter weight, and its quieter running. While I already appreciate the quality improvement of the Andis&#x27; construction over the Peanut, I see that the Peanut was a little easier to get in between the dogs&#x27; toe pads. However, the Andis is faster over a wider area of the dogs&#x27; undersides, especially if I&#x27;m trimming away knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the big Oster clipper and the small Andis trimmer, there&#x27;s still room in my grooming box for a Peanut. I ordered up this peanut-shaped Peanut as a replacement, and it&#x27;s every bit the trimmer that our original Peanut was, except for the funny shape (which I actually like, though I don&#x27;t find it any more or less comfortable than the non-peanut shaped version we originally owned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use any of the combs that come with this. When we tried, they tended to fall off, and as it was, this trimmer didn&#x27;t work all that well on longer hair. No, this Peanut excels at close-cutting, finish trim in tight areas -- places where larger trimmers and clippers are awkward, too noisy, or too big for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good little tool to have at the ready!pecially if I&#x27;m trimming away knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the big Oster clipper and the small Andis trimmer, there&#x27;s still room in my grooming box for a Peanut.

    <li> I&#x27;m no professional but, I would take these clippers over all others!!  I&#x27;ve tried a few other mid level clippers and they just didn&#x27;t cut it, they just didn&#x27;t the the even closeness of the Peanut!</li>
    <li> I have gone through several trimmers both rechargeable and plug-ins. This one is by far the best. It is small and easy to use for beard and eyebrows. I went with the plug-in model, but there is a rechargeable model out now. This is a product that will last for years. Replacement blades are available also.</li>
    <li> Them clips working great for me..thanks guys</li>
    <li> Was a stylist,tried a few trimmers including the awesome Oster. This trimmer is by far one of the best in quickly creating crisp lining for the hairline, sideburns, mustache, beard and comb over eyebrows if needed...:)</li>
    <li> Same clippers my hair dresser uses. And they&#x27;re easy to use.</li>
    <li> As a hair care professional the Wahl peanut has always been in my bag of tricks. I&#x27;m just&lt;br /&gt;thrilled that it comes in black so if it comes in contact w/haircolor all is not stained.</li>
    <li> Nothing short of great. Easy to use. Easy to care for. I&#x27;d definitely buy again, but i have the feeling this one will last me a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I ordered four of these as Christmas presents because they had good reviews.My husband needed a new trimmer for his beard and mustache and is very happy with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Replaces an older clipper that got dull and had expensive replacement blades. Does have a long power cord. The rechargeable on it replaced was a little easier to use without the cord. However, this one works better and was a good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve burned through a dozen or more of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; trimmers and clippers and this one by far is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Very powerful motor powers through my beard very smoothly.  I keep my hair buzzed, and I use this to do it and it works great.</li>
    <li> Highly rated from my hair dresser.  This is the second one I have bought for my sons to use at college.  First one was bought at a Beauty Supply Store, this one was a third of the price.  Only complaint is that it should come with a storage bag or something.</li>
    <li> Lot better than the cordless ones that only last a year or so.</li>
    <li> This in my opinion is the best on the market. i would love though if they could make one wireless.</li>
    <li> My son needed new trimmers and picked these out. When they arrived I was skeptical because they are on the small size. After he started using them, I was happy that he says they are the best trimmers he&#x27;s ever owned. Great price too!</li>
    <li> A very good product. The first time I have ever had clippers like this.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised... I bought two !</li>
    <li> Great small powerful clean cutting clippers</li>
    <li> I bought the Peanut because My father had one, and i used it to line up my hair - it was quite sharp, and perfect for edging out lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this one I bought isn&#x27;t as sharp, Perhaps I bought a different model number? (which hadn&#x27;t occurred to me) I just thought a peanut was a peanut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I&#x27;m sticking with my Andis T- trimmer, its much sharper and still ticking after years and years.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001FDKGIW Wahl Professional 8655-200 Peanut Clipper/trimmer, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for something new to trim my beard with. I had been using hair clippers for years but I couldn&#x27;t find any I thought I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was avoiding \\&quot;beard trimmers\\&quot; because most that I checked into seem to be designed for a really short cut, like for those that like the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girl in one store recommended the Wahl Peanut and, after thinking about it I seemed to recall that my cousin, who cuts hair for a living, uses one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I checked with my cousin and she said that she did indeed use a Peanut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then searched the web for a better price than I would pay in the store where the girl suggested these clippers ($50 seemed a bit much for such small clippers.I found them for less than $35 here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went for the Peanut Professional over the standard model because I like the shape. I chose black since white tends to show dirt more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to how well this trimmer works, it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few times when the motor seemed to slow down but, it never stopped cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the length of each cutting guide is not shown in a more eye catching way. I tried matching the closest size guide to the one I had used on those old hair clippers and it cut slightly longer than I wanted. So, I thought I would go to the next size down which in this case I THOUGHT was the smallest guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I didn&#x27;t want the stubble look but I wound up with it. It turns out that Wahl puts the largest and smallest cutting guides on the same side. The do have the lengths for each guide on the cardboard in the package but it is not as obvious as maybe it could be. So be careful when you chose a guide. The two that are in between the longest and shortest being on the opposite side give an optical illusion that the largest is smaller than it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haveonly used my Peanut once so far but, I see no reason that it won&#x27;t last for a good long time.</li>
    <li> I would have rated these five stars if there was a bigger selection of combs, even if I had to but them as an option. I keep a close trimmed beard and would like to have one half way between the smallest, and between the first two. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yea, it buzzes when you use it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it in the library, but In my bathroom I could care less.</li>
    <li> I researched for several hours, reading reviews, watching video reviews, comparing features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: I&#x27;m an fat-cheeked average white dude with blonde hair and not much facial hair except what comprises the goatee and a little sideburn action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I don&#x27;t need a haircut necessarily, but I need my goatee to look clean cut. This clipper (8655-200) does the trick. Very powerful, easy to maintain, nice clean lines. I use the #2 on my beard, the #1 on my moustache and sideburns, then no guard on my cheeks. Looks NICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I purchased. :-)</li>
    <li> A very handy unit, but it could certainly use more power as it requires multiple passes to get the job done. Otherwise it is a good unit.</li>
    <li> Definitely good quality, but the jump in length from the shortest to the next comb is way too big. Guess I should have gone for one with more discriminating lengths</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I would use it fir everything beard and hair, but it&#x27;s really only good for hair. The blades snag in my beard but it works great for a haircut.</li>
    <li> Wish I had found the Wahl Peanut years ago, instead of blowing all the money I spent on battery operated beard trimmers. Fits nicely in my huge hands, easily controllable, I love that the trimmer blade can be replaced when this one gets dull (unlike my other beard trimmers). If you have a beard and/or a mustache I highly recommend you get a Wahl Peanut to handle your trimming needs.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper its small enough to get some detail in your beard. I loved it so much I ordered 2 more one for my brother and my dad.</li>
    <li> Works great.  No problems at all.  Very compact.  This is the same one my barber uses.  They have a few of these in the hair shop.</li>
    <li> Love it. Super sharp.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the size fool you, it has power! Very thick cord, nothing cheap here. Attachment pieces fit snug but are easy enough to remove. Nice long cord too!</li>
    <li> this is fabulous, I bought it for my boyfriend and I worried because it is small and i swear it seems like he has bear paws instead of hands because they are so big. I was really pleasantly surprised! My only comment is that its cord was fairly short for our purpose and the blades need constant cleaning, but both of these are easy to take care of. This thing is fabulous.</li>
    <li> I have worn a beard for more than 40 years, and in all that time, I &amp;#34;managed&amp;#34; it using the trimmer attachment of an electric shaver plus comb and scisssors. I never did a very good job. First time use of the Wahl Peanut was a revelation; I got a better, more even result in less time than ever before. If only I had known what I was missing. With a little regular maintenance, the Peanut will likely outlive me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note user instructions: &amp;#34;Oiling your clipper. Put a drop of Wahl oil on the blades while the unit is running. Oil should be applied at least ONCE a day&amp;#34; [or each time used].</li>
    <li> Works great for beard trimming!</li>
    <li> I definitely like the power of a corded trimmer and this Wahl seems really good.  I&#x27;m using it to trim my beard.  I know I&#x27;m nit picking but I wish there was a guard size between s1 and s2 but otherwise it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small little buzzer. I was coming from a few wireless trimmers. I had two cheap $15 Wahl trimmers and most recently a Remington trimmer. The remington was pure garbage (sub $20 trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this trimmer for beard management and it does great. It doesn&#x27;t really cut THAT close to the skin, but it will leave you with a pretty solid 5&#x27;clock shadow if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going with (no attachment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the clippers. Thanks</li>
    <li> Everybody likes saving money, and I could not see paying $10 to $15 for a hair cut. Clipper paid for itself in 3 months. Easy to use clipper gets 6 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy tool to have and great for quickly trimming, sideburns, necks and beards. The cord is long enough and it works very well. However, the down side is that it is VERY loud. IT is even louder than my full size Wahl clipper! Otherwise, a good deal</li>
    <li> The best around! A bit of a hassle that you have to brush and oil them after pretty much every use if you want them to perform at peak efficiency on the long term, but a small price to pay for a perfect trim in such a small package.</li>
    <li> I have used the &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; for several months (beard trimming) and it is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and in less than a month the product broke.  I contacted Wahl and they offered to repair or replace the item if I shipped it to them.  I appreciate that they stand behind their product and their customer service person was very nice and respectful but I had to pay about $5 to ship to them and the item was about $35 shipped to my house.  They&#x27;ve now had the item for over 10 business days, I have not heard anything and I&#x27;m without the trimmer.  Beard is a little gnarly and I&#x27;m hesitant to buy something new since supposedly this item should be coming back to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the functionality of this item was good for the few times I used it.  Good value if it were to have held up for at least a year.  Something electrical went on it I believe because when I was using it I heard a zap sound and then it shut off and no longer worked.  I have surge protectors on my outlets and that didn&#x27;t trip so I&#x27;m not sure what happened.</li>
    <li> Simply the best small clipper for the money.</li>
    <li> Tiny enough to get into tight spots, but strong and capable.  Not for full-body trimming, but great for small areas and touch-ups.</li>
    <li> I found this clipper to be woefully underpowered. I thought it would be nice to not have a bulky clipper laying around. I was led to believe that this unit would be perfect for full time duty as my main clipper. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trim my hair on guard #! every two weeks. The clippers clogged and bogged down two easily with that little bit of hair. I will be buying another more powerful set.</li>
    <li> Well I for one am a fan of the peanut, and with the new black design it gives it an updated stylish look. This works perfect for kids and older clients (due to small design) as well as all your other clients. The only reason I only gave it four stars is because sometimes it comes with a defective blade which seems to slip off, but otherwise it works great!</li>
    <li> Two years later and I haven&#x27;t had to even oil the blades yet.  My only feedback is that I wish they made a 1/16th inch guide for this, as it otherwise seems perfect for beard trimming.  They don&#x27;t sell them anywhere.</li>
    <li> Great price, great little clipper. I&#x27;ve bought more than one of these, and they get little detail work done perfectly. Mine has lasted for years, with proper care.&lt;br /&gt;The price for these is well worth it!</li>
    <li> I never thought a corded trimmer could be so much better than cordless. This one trims in one pass. The Wahl wireless I replaced too a half dozen passes and then didn&#x27;t do that great a job. The only drawback is that the longest comb is only 1/2 inch.</li>
    <li> Quality seems good thus far. It doesn&#x27;t cut me up. It has good power. I cut hair and facial hair with this. I use it about once every two weeks along with an electric razor. It doesn&#x27;t have lots of guard length settings, but that&#x27;s not a priority for me.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something more i guess. I&#x27;m not impressed, it is more like a trimmer, which I already have one instead of clippers. Just ok.</li>
    <li> My wife got to know this product at a beauty shop and wanted to have one at home to trim all the Family. Handy, light wight and work well.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Simple and sturdy razor that&#x27;s perfect for home use. I personally happened upon this one after reading a good article about it on the tech review website The Wirecutter, and their analysis was exactly correct, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Picked this up based on the Wirecutter review, and I was delighted.  Small but VERY powerful. Fits in my travel kit without any hassle, and trims my beard in many few passes than my rechargeable. Definitely has fewer bells and whistles than other chargers I&#x27;ve used, but it works so well that I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
    <li> My wife is a hairstylist and is using these at work, they work great and last a long time I would recommend these to anyone, hands down for the money you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with the peanut.  I fade my own hair and this gives me the most crisp linings and I do have the fancy  gray andis taper machine that the barbers use.</li>
    <li> This is what clippers are supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Feels too light and cheap.  Snagged and pulled my hair.  Sent back immediately and ordered the Andis T Outliner for about 12 bucks more.</li>
    <li> This is WAY better than all the other shavers I&#x27;ve owned:  usually they get clogged up or broke or just quit working in less than a year and get stuck on longer hair:  this clippers just cuts and doesn&#x27;t get stuck on anything and I&#x27;ve had no problems with the blade and don&#x27;t even really clean it very well to be honest.</li>
    <li> I got this because i broke one of the guards on my old peanut. I like the color and decide to give it a try. It doesn&#x27;t feel like the shave is as close as my old one but lucky for me i can still go back to my other peanut and just use the new guard for what i need to do.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It is very powerful for its size and that is a great plus! However, the plastic build and the lightness in the hand made me feel at first impression that with frequent use it would fail. This is not tested, just an impression. I also felt that because of the build the price is a bit steep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an African American male who travels frequently for business and needs something to &amp;#34;keep it clean&amp;#34; get these as a secondary clipper because of it&#x27;s small footprint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the blades are concerned I think it needs frequent cleaning more so than other clippers to keep tip top shape.</li>
    <li> Do not order from this company. I ordered a clipped set. It would not work, so it was returned. I had to pay $10.00. After several communication I was issued a refund. All I wanted was a working product. I should not have to pay return shipping on a defective product. Be careful when ordering from this company. I had to put 1 star because I couldn&#x27;t rate BYPLE 0 Stars.</li>
    <li> Awesome powerful little clippers!</li>
    <li> I got this 5 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still my go-to clipper, the shave is so close and it just always works.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to pack for trips, nice cord length, and feels good in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always shocked that the thing still works, I&#x27;m on here looking for a new blade, it&#x27;s a bit dull now, but again, it&#x27;s been 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another, full size, Wahl clipper and was really disappointed by the shave, it covered more ground but wasn&#x27;t nearly as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazing value, great product.</li>
    <li> I use this little wonder to shave all parts of my body. Well built and I cant imagine it will piss out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> worked great, just what I expected</li>
    <li> Not impressed I bought this trimmer based on reviews I use it to trim my beard which is horrible dosent cut fast have to wait till it cuts not smooth tugs hair you must cut against the grain to have a some what of a good cut .... its not good on face but is works fine for longer hair or any other cutting ...... cheaply made the blade isn&#x27;t fully metal there is just a silver of a blade ... My whal body trimmer which is full metal blade is much better to trim beard do not get this trimmer to shave beard !</li>
    <li> Great little clipper. Easy to hold and manipulate around my bald head. Plenty powerful, especially for it&#x27;s size. Small enough to travel with. I had a full size Wahl for years and this one is much easier to work with.</li>
    <li> Small enough for details and well powered.</li>
    <li> They paid for themselves the first time I used this kit.  Years later, it&#x27;s still working well.  Great item.  Your regular barber will hate it, but pocket the difference and buy him a cup of coffee now and them.  ;-)</li>
    <li> Great unit. Small, but powerful. I wish it had a few more trimming attachment options.</li>
    <li> It has a seven foot cord.  Durable plastic clip attachments.  It was a gift and they stated you also need to purchase another product for blade cleaning.  We purchased an extra bottle of oil, but he stated about half an ounce of oil had leaked inside the shipping package.  It came with a smaller oil container and was packaged better and did not leak. He used it to trim his hair and beard, but stated he had to trim beard slowly as it was too heavy for the motor to cut quickly.  Overall, he seemed happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband had neck surgery recently and doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable using a razor to shave yet.  This keeps his beard under control.</li>
    <li> Very powerful little electric dog trimmer.  I just wish there was one as powerful in a cordless model.  The cord overpowers the little trimmer because it&#x27;s thick and stiff.  Otherwise, a great little tool</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Replaced same with this and it is perfect.</li>
    <li> One of the most powerful corded trimmers on the market. It can be a bit loud but thats ok. I use it profesionally. Hope wahl keeps making this product and doesn&#x27;t try to change it. Long live the peanut !</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned</li>
    <li> I always thought shavers had universal voltage converters. Never go to use this at all and I&#x27;ve used many electric trimmers and shavers. Cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> When I first looked at it, I was very doubtful. Tiny in size, and I despised the name, but, the trmmer  is awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably had a dozen hair-clippers over the years. I cut my hair once a week, myself. (I&#x27;m a grown man, in case you were wondering.) I&#x27;ve probably had a dozen different (full-size) clippers. The best ones were by Wahl, but the reliability and durability of even their clippers isn&#x27;t what it used to be. (The best before this one was a Wahl &amp;#34;Sport,&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore.) And there&#x27;s the issue of sharpening or replacing blades for the full size models. (Not cheap, and a bit of a pain.) Sorry to digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what you want to know. A pro hairstylist recommended this little, tiny, clipper - and it&#x27;s amazing. Stays sharp, cuts closer than any of the others (I always use the closest setting with no attachment, whichever clipper I&#x27;m using), weighs less, doesn&#x27;t hurt my head and, since the blade-width is so tiny, it follows the contours of my head more closely than its big siblings. Haven&#x27;t had need to buy the replacement blade assembly yet, but that also looks like a better way to go than the big boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just great. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like my Peanut.  Light weight and well balanced for use with curved parts of the body that needs shaving.  I found a friend for life</li>
    <li> I use it for my face to get a short stubble look. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair, and get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
    <li> cut when other units wouldn&#x27;t..&lt;br /&gt;Would recomment for thin to medium viscosity hair...&lt;br /&gt;Fits nicely in the hand too.&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
    <li> Love the peanut! I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and would highly recommend. Great for outlining and cleaning up the sides of haircuts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s noisy but works very good</li>
    <li> trimmer is ver small in size. It&#x27;s does the works for cutting beards but not strong enough for cutting head hair.</li>
    <li> Good and fast shipping!!! I loved the product!!!!</li>
    <li> good, gets the job done, cheap. cant go wrong with this. I would go for it, its good, not bad, not too shabby</li>
    <li> Started out great, but it has already broken in only a little over a month of use.</li>
    <li> This is our second peanut- the first one survived some water damage but sounds more like a lawn mower then a hair clipper now so we figured we would get a new one. Great value!</li>
    <li> The Peanut clipper/trimmer is all I use for my beard.  It works great and I love the way it fits on my hand while trimming my beard,</li>
    <li> An trimmer for its size!</li>
    <li> nothing needs to be said, these are the best</li>
    <li> Excellent! Great product! Working excellent, just like the one I owned before. Definitely will do business again! Wahl has been always great!</li>
    <li> Good product and fast shipping. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> this unit is great unit for your personal assets. specially if you want to low your beard. reasonable quality. hang for the bucks.</li>
    <li> Really great. especially for the money.  My husband looks really nice after a trim. wish he would keep that beard!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this a couple months, and use it at least once per week. I&#x27;ve only screwed up my beard once (used the wrong attachment and almost shaved it off!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put 1 or 2 drops of oil on the blade after every use and use the brush on it to spread the oil around. I read that it may dull the blade faster if you don&#x27;t treat it like a baby (my little baby peanut! lmao)</li>
    <li> My barber uses the peanut in her work, and has for years.  She recommended it so I could trim my hair in between haircuts and also my beard.  Works great, easy to use, small size is a plus.</li>
    <li> I use these professionally for clients. I have small hands, so I love the size. They are just a bit louder than what I would like. My guests have said it is not too loud near their ears though, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with them. They are just louder than the Oster edger I had previously.</li>
    <li> Nice multi-purpose trimmer. Includes up to a 1/2&amp;#34; guard, which is longer than most other beard trimmers out there. I also use this for &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; my head - no, it won&#x27;t clean your scalp bald, but using it without the guard is easy, safe, and leaves you with a largely unnoticeable amount of hair.</li>
    <li> great for all hair types and multiple functions!!! my beautiful black husband shaves his head with it and no matter how long his hair has grown the different attachments will always get the job done!!&lt;br /&gt; and good size for travel.... i only wish we could find a case for it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 10 years and these are my favorite clippers. I started developing bad razor burn from shaving with a manual razor. I switched to clippers about a year ago. After trying various models with no luck I decided to try the Peanut Clipper. I have not been disappointed at all. They are easy to clean and give the shaver a great clip on any setting.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use this set fully yet, but what I have seen of it I like so far.  It was nice to find a cutting set designed mainly for a woman&#x27;s smaller hands, it&#x27; more light weight too.  To be fair, I would have to hold off my recommending of this product until I have fully used it, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer to maintain my beard. I looked at several models before settling on this trimmer and I am very pleased with this product. The trimmer comes with guards that were perfect length to maintain a nice &amp;#34;office/professional&amp;#34; beard. Other trimmers that I viewed seemed to have guards that were either too short or too long. The trimmer body is small, but comfortable hold and easy to control while detailing. The trimmer is also very powerful - it goes through my thick beard hair with ease. Cleanup is also not an issue as the blade pops off easily with just a bit of thumb pressure. The only con I can think of is that the trimmer is pretty loud.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Wahl Peanut line last year, when a friend lent me an older version of this shaver. It was a very good shaver, and so two months ago I bought this version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the purchase. My facial hair grows in a rather convoluted direction field, including a cowlick on my neck, and the shaver has no real problems shaving any of it. Keep in mind however that it is still an electric shaver, and it will only take you down to a very thin stubble, not as close as a cutthroat/safety razor can get. I chose to give this four stars because my particular model seems to give a less close shave than my friend&#x27;s model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting guides are really fantastic however. They allow me to keep my beard without it getting long and unruly, which happens rather quickly in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As previously stated, I have only owned it for a couple of months, so I cannot say anything about its longevity, but at this time I have only minor complaints. All in all it is a very solid product, so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Three years later, it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;ve mistreated it to be honest - I oiled the blades for the first time a month ago (and it really needed it!). The shortest comb attachment has broken, one of the tines fell off, no big deal. I definitely recommend this shaver highly, it&#x27;s been in constant use this whole time and has held up to the abuse.</li>
    <li> This this sure is powerful for such a little guy. You know that short guy that has a short temper because he has little man syndrome? Well, this thing is that, but in the best way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many, many other beard/hair trimmers and none of them cut through hair like this one. You plug it in right away and it is ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did nip my balls when I was trimming with this thing, so be careful.</li>
    <li> Very precise cuts, very nice</li>
    <li> Powerful clipper.  3 haircuts paid for this.  Now I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber.  My lovely wife took his place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used rechargable trimmers in the past.The peanut plugs directly to wall outlet.No battery to recharge..Immediately noticed that the motor in the peanut seems to have much more power than  battery operated trimmers.The peanut has only one adapter suitable for beard trimming.The other adapters are more suited to doing a full haircut.That said,I would recommend this device.Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming my beard</li>
    <li> Works the way that it should and takes up less space in the drawer.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement for one that died after 15 years.  Good little machine.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer. I got it because I was tired of getting battery powered trimmers that would get worse and worse over time. Over a year later, and this one is going strong. Can take as long as I want and not worry about a battery dying.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Conair hair trimmer to trim my beard for years. It finally bit the dust so I decided to try the Wahl peanut. Whoa! From what seemed to take weeks to trim my beard, and even then it was not as short or as even as I wanted, my first use of the peanut took less than 30 seconds (and was perfectly even). I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (02/01/14): I would like to add a comment that others might like to keep in mind (although my previous review still holds and for my purposes everything I said still applies):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife needed to have her hair cut back to 1/4\\&quot; after her recent chemo so I took out the peanut and #2 attachment. The peanut did a fair job of cutting her hair, but -- due to a previous chemo hair loss that had not grown back in fully -- her hair was very fine and was able to clog the peanut somewhat. It seems counter intuitive that finer hair would have that effect but it was like hair that fine becomes &#x27;elusive&#x27; and the peanut could not get a good grip/bite in the hair. I think that it would take a much more powerful motor than the peanut has to drive through the hair in that situation.</li>
    <li> Nice. Replaced the white one. I&#x27;d stick with that. It&#x27;s not just a color thing.</li>
    <li> Good little clipper set. Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my barber when trimming around the neckline nut it gets the job done better than most of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great product.. I did get a little cut on my scrotum but still a great product....</li>
    <li> Love this little clipper!&lt;br /&gt;Trims beard, mustache easily.</li>
    <li> Works okay for a while then wears out fairly soon.</li>
    <li> Great product!! portable, easy to use, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a previous one before purchasing this one, and it last me over 5 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No delay, arrived as noted in ad.</li>
    <li> I have had Wahl clippers before and wanted a smaller set. I like the look and feel of these but wish they were more powerful and cut better. They bogged down with my short hair a bit but still cut well.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these! This is our second set but our first ones lasted 5 years and that&#x27;s with my husband shaving his head one - two times a week!</li>
    <li> To get this same performance from a cordless trimmer you would have to spend 3-4 times as much. If you have the money then buy a cordless. If you want a strong trimmer for a good price then buy this and an extension cord, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quiet model - and this seemed to have some good reviews in the autism community.  It was louder than I was hoping it would be, but overall we got through it.  Being small makes it a bit less intimidating to him, and not as loud as the larger models.</li>
    <li> A site whose exceedingly comprehensive reviews I trust gave this model rave reviews. They were right - this does indeed blow away all of the cordless models, several of which I own.</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers! I borrowed a peanut 8655 to groom my longhair cats, and it was just what was needed, so I purchased one here. Having used other small units that were noisy, became dull rapidly or simply broke, I wanted to try this out first.&lt;br /&gt;The 8655 is not too loud, keeping my cats calm, and remains sharp and easy to clean. The person I borrowed from uses hers to groom her maltese dog, and recommended the peanut highly. I have seen these used in several local salons as well, so they must hold up. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I read about this product on The Sweethome and was in the market for a new, powerful beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little guy works as described. It&#x27;s nifty, easy to use, comfortable to hold, and most of all, extremely powerful. The torque from this wall plug powered unit is substantial. Night and day from any wireless clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a replacement for my cheap Philips Norelco G370, which I&#x27;ve used for about a year before it finally died, no longer holding a charge. I had a good experience with that product prior to its passing, especially with its variable clipper head, which I found provided a nice close trim to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me with my biggest problem with the Peanut. Even on its lowest clip attachment number 1, it doesn&#x27;t provide as close as shave as the Norelco on even the number 2 setting. This is a big problem for me. I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m not getting nearly as close a trim as I need. I wish there were better, more customizable options for the trimmer length on the Peanut. It would be a perfect little grooming device if this were the case.</li>
    <li> I really hate shaving with razors.  I use my beard trimmers to either keep a beard and \\&quot;shave\\&quot; a good neck line or \\&quot;shave\\&quot; entirely to a close scruff.  I bought the peanut because my $19 Wahl cordless from Target failed miserably.  It lost speed and couldn&#x27;t cut at all after just a couple months.  The peanut is small, feels great in your hand and is really powerful.  The peanut is the best clipper I&#x27;ve every owned.  The guides snap on more smoothly and securely than any clipper I&#x27;ve used (as it should if it&#x27;s a professional model).  It&#x27;s also the closest \\&quot;shave\\&quot; I&#x27;ve had after years with 4 different clippers.  I&#x27;ve read that the andis t-outliner gets even closer, but the peanut works great.  Other reviews claim it&#x27;s loud, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s loud at all.  It also never gets hot and never pulls hair.  If you want a close \\&quot;shave,\\&quot; this trimmer is perfect.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  I use it for my beard and for the cost there is not much that is better.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  Compact and powerful  I don&#x27;t bother with any of the guards (nature took care of some of that!) and this does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this little guy is a great balance of function and value- definitely highly recommended for the average beard-trimming and light/moderate hair-trimming needs. Beats the pants off any of the battery-powered trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Have used this for close to a year now and it works great.</li>
    <li> Super lightweight and easy to use! I use it for clipping a good haircut and for the beard. Just perfect!</li>
    <li> Small and solid, as promised. A case or organizing feature would be nice but otherwise, it is a great tool</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I thought it might be good for trimming my infant son&#x27;s hair. Well, that doesn&#x27;t work so well, but not because of the trimmer - it&#x27;s just dang hard to get an infant to stand still for a trim. If you&#x27;re doing a buzz-cut I guess this would work for infants though. It&#x27;s pretty tiny, and instead of using it for my son&#x27;s hair, I now use it to trim my own in between hair cuts. A little sideburn work, eyebrows, around the ears, etc and it&#x27;s perfect for that. Small enough to be easily maneuvered, but if you&#x27;re cutting a full-size adult head you probably want the bigger version. It comes with good accessories to - four sizes of guides that automatically cut to a certain length.At $25 it&#x27;s worth it just to visit the barber a little less often.</li>
    <li> The machine is serving us very well!  Holds up perfectly! The service was great and we are super happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. Hands down.</li>
    <li> This thing is a beast.  I was sick and tired of the cheap beard trimmers that only last so long.  I have a feeling this will last many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trim my neck every day with no guards and have only been nicked once.  I wasn&#x27;t following the directions of keeping blade perpendicular to the skin.  I get a shorter trim with the Peanut than I did with an Oster trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming your beard with the peanut is really quick compared to other less powerful trimmers.  My only wish is that the guards were shorter, it&#x27;s tough to get in under your nose.  I think I might trim the guards back myself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Excellent seller!</li>
    <li> My cordless beard trimmer died after about six years. It just started losing power. I decided to go with a corded trimmer to avoid that issue. There&#x27;s no battery to die out! The Peanut is a fantastic size; it&#x27;s very comfortable in your hand, and it does a great job on my beard. It never bogs-down a bit. Two things kept it from getting two stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I wish it had a vacuum to catch the clipped hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I wish it came with a wider selection of guards. It comes with four guards, and the included guards will be sufficient for most folks, but my wife likes a very short (scruffy) beard. The shortest guard doesn&#x27;t quite get there, but it&#x27;s close enough.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Wahl Peanut I&#x27;ve owned (I fried 2 in Europe using converter plugs - so don&#x27;t do that).  I use it to buzz my facial hair because I hate shaving.  It works better than any beard trimmer I&#x27;ve tried.  Stays sharp for about a year, then either replace the unit or replace the blades.  Works well as finishing clippers too if you cut your own hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to upgrade the hair trimmer I had before, and boy, is it definitely an upgrade. This trimmer has some power behind it and it does a better job quicker. It&#x27;s also easy to clean. It might be more trimmer than I need since I don&#x27;t intend to use it on my head except for sideburn control, but I don&#x27;t regret my purchase.</li>
    <li> Good for the money ... Works like it should. Now I will type eleven more words because it tells you to.</li>
    <li> Does a great job on neck and ear hairs. Needs to be oiled on a regular basis to work efficiently.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and is just as described. Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Great little beard trimmer..lots of power!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that is small.  But It doesnt give a very clean look and it&#x27;s pretty loud</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby for Chritstmas after doing some research. I was disappointed with it when it came to doing a beard and mustache because it just does not perform well with that. It does make pretty good shape up lines. It also does not get hot. So I&#x27;m in the middle with this one.</li>
    <li> I love the size of this!!  I have small hands, and I&#x27;m using it to cut my 11-month old&#x27;s hair. No problems so far!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, lasts for a long time.  Just does the job.  a great tool.  An excellent little trimmer.  It is light weight and easy to handle.  This is the second one purchased in 25 years.  Glad it is still made.</li>
    <li> Awesome trimmer. I use it on my husbands hair and beard. Love it! I love the small size. It&#x27;s just as powerful as a big bulky trimmer.</li>
    <li> I had the smaller white Wahl Peanut.  I decided to try this one.  It has a little bet better shape to fit your hand better and is quite a bit easier to hold on to.</li>
    <li> Its like having an actual barber machine just mini size. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it are the clips, I wish it came with smaller sizes for an even lighter trim. Overall great product for the price!</li>
    <li> this is awesome!I lost all my hairdressing tools and this was a replacement thank you</li>
    <li> Great seller, fast shipping and product just as described. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This started off to be a great trimmer,  2 weeks into using it it broke! It slipped into the sink with barely any height and the top broke off. Very very poorly made. I had the older Peanut and that thing was amazing. This one broke so fast, waste of my money.</li>
    <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!...</li>
    <li> Small, compact unit. Works great! I highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> WOW I LOVE IT.  I always wanted clippers that plugged into the wall, as my cordless ones are never charged when I need them to be.  This thing works really well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaved my head the day I got it, just to try it out.  Girlfriend was weirded out by my baldness.  It grew back.  Worth it.</li>
    <li> Love the peanut its awesome to trim!!</li>
    <li> I use it to trim my beard. It&#x27;s so much more powerful than the battery operated models. No pulling hair with this one. My only complaint is that I like to trim my beard short and the smallest guard is just a little too long.</li>
    <li> If I have a few days (or more) of beard stubble, I use this before the razor. This is mainly what I bought it for and it works great, leaves the equivalent of about one day&#x27;s growth (my growth is about medium, not heavy, not light). I wish I&#x27;d had this when I had my beard, it would be an excellent tool for beards. Before I shaved off my mustache, I used the Peanut for trimming and it really worked great! It worked great to shave off the mustache, too. I&#x27;ve removed my mustaches with various tools, and the Peanut is the best yet. I&#x27;m a craftsman who enjoys using good quality tools, and this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Peanut for a few months now and have used it to cut my own hair, with great results. One day my hair was way too long and it was time to go to the barber. I figured the barber could fix anything I did with the Wahl if I didn&#x27;t cut it too short, so I decided to give it a try, and I haven&#x27;t been to the barber since. I cut it when I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for a few days. I put on the #4 stand-off and buzz it all over the sides and back (I go over it a few times, pausing to use a comb, until I get it to where it looks okay). I don&#x27;t go too high up on the sides, just a trimmer-width or less over the ears, and somehow the top always seems to come out fine (staying long enough to part and comb nicely). Without any stand-off, I trim around the ears and trim-up the sideburns. With the #2 stand-off, I do my eyebrows. Using a hand mirror, I scissor off the the hair at the back of my neck if it&#x27;s too long. Then I give it a good shampoo, and the next day if anything needs a little more trim (which about half the time it does) I give it a quick tune-up with the Wahl, and I&#x27;m good for about three weeks. This little baby is going to pay for itself pretty quickly, if it hasn&#x27;t already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peanut is fairly quiet, too, doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears at all. I&#x27;ve had three other electric hair clippers (full size) and the Peanut whips them all for sound and clean-cutting. About those other three: one died, one actually broke and fell apart while I was using it, and one is very dull and does not have replaceable blades like the Peanut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only CON: I like very pliable cords that tend to hang straight, and this one is a little too stiff and plasticky, but I&#x27;ve seen worse.an-cutting.

    <li> I love it. I will never again use cordless. You could trim a hedge with this thing.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Only quirk that probably applies to me is I wanted a small number for the cutting guide, other than that it works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I am going to be honest as possible to help the people out there wondering if they should buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this product over the other high reviewed trimmers because it had the best reviews out of all of them. This product is really that good, that DESPITE the limitations of the guards, I am very satisfied by this product. I guess the reason for his is because it cuts so well and leaves a barbershop type of even trim ob your beard. It truly makes you look fresh and clean unlike other trimmers that require one to go over one side multiple times or even pulling hairs. If only this product had a guard that was in between the smallest length (3/8) and second smallest, it would be perfect. For this reason, I have to cut my beard a bit shorter than I want it, or have it longer. IF ONLY THEY HAD ONE IN BETWEEN!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This think is great! Sharpens with age too!</li>
    <li> Bought based on the Sweethome&#x27;s recommendation. Their review is spot on.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have owned of these clippers, The first I was rough with when I was cleaning them and got tired and threw them away, Then I went on a mission to get a better one, Tried many ones ranging from $15 to $40, Didnt like many of them, I did get the Razor/trimmer from Gillete, I did like that and still have that, But the others were not as powerful and the attachments always feel off or clicked to a different setting. Very upsetting, So I bought this again, and I love it, it is VERY powerful, a little loud but that really doesnt matter to me. The attachments have never fell off, I trim my chest hairs, head and beard with this thing and it gets all the hairs evenly. I recommend this to anyone who has more hair to trim, or to people who shave their heads, chest or other body parts, not THAT body part, it is too powerful and you will probably cut the skin, Been there done that.</li>
    <li> I works great for trimming ears and feet on dogs!&lt;br /&gt;I hope it lasts a long time, then it will meet the 5 star rating</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t have the hair he once did and wanted to stop spending money to get a trim by purchasing this item.  Every professional hair stylist I&#x27;ve spoken with loves the Wahl Peanut.  I used this yesterday for the 1st time and while I felt a little intimidated cutting hair it was easy.  My husband was very satisfied with the hair cut and I&#x27;m no longer nervous about using it.  It operates quickly, easy to clean, and to trim up areas around the ears, neck, etc.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> my husband lives by the peanut. he has really thick hair. he cuts it himself. theres times when it sounds like its struggling but maybe because he let his hair get too long in between</li>
    <li> I was disapointed when I realized that the smallest guide is no longer included in the attachments package, I like to wear my beard very short...I have looked for the smallest guide but apparently is no longer carried by Wahl</li>
    <li> I spent way, way too long obsessing over my next beard-trimmer, furiously reading all-manner of online reviews and blogs (yes there are actually blogs on the subject).  I&#x27;ve gone through 3-4 trimming devices over the last 7 years of beardom.  One was a &#x27;vacuum&#x27; model which was a dissapointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept coming back to the WAHL Peanut and finally pulled the trigger on the Black model.  I love it. Main difference, it is NOT a cordless, rechargeable model, and this in and of itself makes it my favorite all-time beard trimmer (and manscaper). Cord &#x3D; Power. Power &#x3D; No Snags or eye-watering hair pulls. It plows effortlessly through 6 weeks of growth like a fine tuned John Deere riding mower. It is also tiny, like holding a baseball, so very easily maneuverable. Don&#x27;t be deceived by its small size, it packs plenty of power. It ships with 4 basic trimmer length combs - I like simple!  As an added bonus, my wife has taken a liking to the Peanut for her personal grooming needs in the nether-region. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Love it,  great price ,arrived  early and it works  great,this is my second peanut trimmer  had to replace my other because I accidentally dropped it at work.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby after trying countless different one&#x27;s... I think we have a winner.</li>
    <li> Perfect little machine for beard trimming. But does not cut very close to face. I would recommend product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this clipper! Perfect for clean up and nice fine, straight lines around edges.</li>
    <li> My husbands clippers he had broke and he wanted another one. He paid $69 for the old ones found these on amazon with the same&lt;br /&gt;quality at half the price</li>
    <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t plug into the socket very easily.  I almost have to force it in. But once its plugged in it works great.</li>
    <li> Works well but it vibrates SO MUCH. Makes it uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Been using wahl for many years. Great product well made. Would definitely recommend to anyone with a beard. Will buy again</li>
    <li> These Trimmers are very nice and work well. They are small and feel great when using them. I would recommend these to any guy with coarse hair.</li>
    <li> This razor is small but packed full of power and is super easy to use. Great to travel with as well.</li>
    <li> I have had these for a really long time (6 years) and I am still happy with their performance. Thanks Wahl and Amazon!</li>
    <li> My new Wahl trimmer is just what I expected.  I can use the trimmer&#x27;s standard metal head or the low cut guard to keep facial hair at exactly the length I want, not to long, not to short.  No more finding my old rechargeable battery dead just when I need it most.  One request for an additional guard that is slanted for around the ear trimming.</li>
    <li> I used to use cordless clippers for a long time but didn&#x27;t like them too much. The peanut is great. Lots of power for its small size. Cuts great. Works great with the attachments. I don&#x27;t mind this corded machine at all.</li>
    <li> General quality is as expected from Wahl - no problems.  These clippers are a little louder than some other that we have used but functionality and performance have been great.</li>
    <li> Too bad no carry bag with the set.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other 5 Star Reviews</li>
    <li> Just a great clipper!</li>
    <li> Works awesome!  My son loved it</li>
    <li> Does a great job on trimming my beard</li>
    <li> A really bad spires :( I don&#x27;t know where is my staff</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have ever owned. Hands down. Seen many people using it no one ever complained.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> It would have been nice to have a few more clip options, but the thing is super powerful. I have a really thick beard so cordless trimmers just don&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot so far.  I am interested to see how it holds up over time.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Works great</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as other electric buzzers.</li>
    <li> All I need clippers for is my weekly beard trim. Before landing on the Peanut I went through several clippers purchased from the local drug store. Every time I opened a new one up I would be overwhelmed with a dozen different guides, wall adapters, charging stations, hair clips, multiple combs, adjustable guides, and a bunch of other plastic garbage I had no use for. Eventually I would end up losing parts and become so frustrated I just threw the whole ugly mess in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely nothing fancy about this product, and that&#x27;s why I love it. It feels good in your hand, easy to use, comes with all the guides you&#x27;ll realistically need, and it&#x27;ll probably keep clipping away till long after I lose all my hair. I can&#x27;t comment on how well it would perform trimming your whole head, but if you&#x27;re just keeping your beard tidy, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine almost a year now, with weekly use I still have half a bottle of the included cutting oil left.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been frustrated trying to keep the man hair on my face cleaned up and looking like I shower. I&#x27;ve had all sorts of battery powered trimmers over the years. My aunt is a hair stylist and she always uses professional clippers when shaping and trimming my beard and mustache. The battery powered trimmers worked for me for a while, but the battery would slowly decay over a few months until I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a full trim on a single charge. So went with the real deal. Now that I&#x27;ve used these a few times, I will never go back to a battery powered trimmer. None of the half dozen or so battery powered trimmers I&#x27;ve used over the past decade have come close to the quality or power of this little Wahl Peanut. The guards that came with it are perfect for the face and I can stop worrying about having to charge my face clippers. PSA: Buy two if you need to trim anything below the neck.</li>
    <li> Awesome for trimming around the edges of your ears and back of the neck. Also perfect for cutting the sides of your hair to a 4 or shorter.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the right side for beard trimming and its annoying that you have to plug it in. I&#x27;d recommend it for cutting hair besides the beard and getting the cordless version.</li>
    <li> The attachments have very long fingers and I am not able to get under my nose as well as I&#x27;d like and the fingers are way to sharp. I do like the fact that there is no batteries to charge and it seems powerful enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Love it.  Love it.  One of the best investment I have ever made.  It is so easy to hold and cuts well (easy even for a total novice).  When and if it wears out I will definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Does the job! Is a little sharp in the beginning but works great!</li>
    <li> Not for the faint hearted or those that prefer a longer beard.  S4 is the longest guard &amp; it trims to the same as a barbershop #4, not bad as I keep my beard short but prefer it a little longer in the winter &amp; hadn&#x27;t expected the volume of hair that came off my face the first time I used it!  I got it primarily for the power &amp; I was tired of replacing the battery powered ones every year....</li>
    <li> The absolute best household clipper set you can buy. If you cut your own hair, you&#x27;ll find that this small powerful set of clippers are easily maneuvered around your head, as you don&#x27;t have to fumble with a large-bodied clipper. Powerful motor makes the job easy and quick.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Replaced same that I had.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt recommend this for cutting hair thats longer than an inch. It will just bog down, and you have to keep removing the hair. It works great for shorter hair, and for cleaning up though!</li>
    <li> Pretty average. Kind of small. No better than ion battery clipper I have been using.</li>
    <li> Great little clipper.</li>
    <li> This is a very well-made beard trimmer.  The casing is sturdy and the motor is very high-powered.  The blade is sharp and as long as you treat it regularly with oil (which you should do anyway), it cuts just as well now as it did when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the red blade guard.  It helps keep the blade from being damaged and fits on snugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone looking for a trimmer that will last them years.</li>
    <li> Peanut is loud didn&#x27;t cut any better than a regular clipper it was just ok&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I returned it and still got charged for shipping and&lt;br /&gt;restocking fee so I received 2/3 my original paid price. Lost out because&lt;br /&gt;the product was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> As good as everyone says they are.  Light and powerful</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to shave and it works great</li>
    <li> Good not great but they work ok</li>
    <li> excellent! husband uses it often!</li>
    <li> Use it to help trim my beard, works well, but I think there are probably better specific purpose beard trimmers.</li>
    <li> I just received the Wahl Professional Peanut in the mail two days ago and I must say it is great! For someone like me who has stubbornly coarse hair, I was expecting it to be another flop like every other clipper I have tried up to this point. I was amazed at how easily it powered through my thick beard without snagging and pulling on stray hairs. I can&#x27;t comment yet on the longevity of it since I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple days but based on what I am reading from other Amazon reviewers, it seems to be a high-quality, long lasting set of clippers!</li>
    <li> Lots of power! Small device that gets big jobs done. High quality.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves this kit! He still uses it to this day(nearly a year later), and it works just as well as the day I bought it!</li>
    <li> It is so small, looks like toys and makes a loud noise</li>
    <li> Great product, has much more power than those battery powered trimmers.  Small and easy to put away.</li>
    <li> It cuts close and it&#x27;s nice and small to get those hard to reach spots. Only bad thing is that it heats up fast.</li>
    <li> Speed up the hair cutting process with this tool you can get hair cut fast and accurately.</li>
    <li> works great but this little trimmer is too loud.&lt;br /&gt;hard to trim around the ear because of the noise it makes.</li>
    <li> Like: The size and feel of this little guy. Before I had the Peanut, I found myself gouging my ears and neck. It was only a matter of time before I damaged my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Like: I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s worth the $30 price tag.</li>
    <li> The peanut works really well for me. No problems at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bald, this makes me not look like an old man. Good shaver for those that &amp;#34;matured&amp;#34; faster than others in life :)</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair cutter, so I bought it.  Does a great job, tho wish it came with a case.  Cord is a bit cumbersome, but not a problem.  Reasonably priced and good value.</li>
    <li> Very great trimmers! So worth it</li>
    <li> shave your beard with this, and then with a regular electric.&lt;br /&gt;exactly what you need if you are like me and grow a beard in 4 days.</li>
    <li> Great shaver especially for black men who need something to shave/trim facial hair.</li>
    <li> Nearly perfect. I really wish this clipper came with a 1/16 trimmer. Otherwise it works very well. It&#x27;s powerful and not nearly as loud as some of the other reviewers have claimed.</li>
    <li> I loved it, then after a month or 2. it stopped working forever. i want to buy again but i dont want to have to buy one every month.</li>
    <li> Works great, I gave this to my husband, which is a very hairy guy, and he loves it too!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one.  I use it when I don&#x27;t feel like razor shaving my head.  It cuts super close and never EVER nicks or bites.  It&#x27;s small, but powerful.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I ever owned, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well with edging up my kid&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist and have used the Pnut for years.  It&#x27;s great for home use.  Easy to use for beard and mustache trims.  It works great for clipper cuts as well.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, obliviously it is not the greatest machine in the world, but for the price it really does the job. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to buy  this because of the good reviews and I like small things in general. I am deployed in Afghanistan and i thought it would be great for cutting my buddies hair. I used it twice and it just stopped working, completely just stopped.I was disappointed. Maybe it is just for beards. Thats what I would suggest using it for, JUST BEARDS.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Wahl Peanut Clipper.  I recommend it to anyone that needs a clipper.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks very much!</li>
    <li> I  bought these clippers because I started cutting my kids hair -- i have an older pair of wahl clippers that were good for me, not for my kids. my kids move around a lot and also have more hair then their bald father -- the old clippers seemed to pull their hair and we had to go over the same spot multiple times. so, i bought these clippers to shave my head but also cut my kids hair too. i did a lot of research and ultimately did not want to spend $120 on the oster 76. i also did not want to get a balding clipper -- i wanted something to do both.</li>
    <li> Very useful, practical and easy to operate... i reccomend it if you are looking for a small but efficient clipper</li>
    <li> Wahl Professional 8655-200 Peanut Clipper/trimmer, Black...I bought this clipper for trimming my husband&#x27;s hair, it&#x27;s compact, makes trimming easy. Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful little clipper/trimmer.  I use it to shave my head but what i noticed is that if my hair grows out a little, it tends to pull my hair instead of cut it.  I think for the price its a good deal.</li>
    <li> This trimmer shaves my beard and sideburns perfectly. Almost the same as if I went to the barber for a trim. I just use a comb to trim my sideburns and BAM I&#x27;m ready to go to work or hit up the town.</li>
    <li> Does pull a little bit, but did appear to improve over time. Gives a really close shave without any guard.</li>
    <li> Best you can buy for the price. Recommended.</li>
    <li> The Wahl &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; packs a powerful punch. It easily shaves my neck and trims my beard with comfort and ease. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> So far so good...will update if anything changes.  I have used peanut trimmers for years, and this set is only to add another to our repertoire at home...the other ones I own have lasted years and years. It&#x27;s a little noisy but is very gentle on tender skin and gets quite close at the same time.</li>
    <li> I use this about every other day and its been great so far. Much better than the cordless trimmer I was using previously.</li>
    <li> I regularly cut my hair short and I find this light weight affordable cutter wonderful. I highly recommend it for beard trimming and buzz cuts!</li>
    <li> Good quality, but the attachments are frustrating. It&#x27;s almost impossible to trim one&#x27;s moustache as the prongs on all of the attachments but the tiny one are far too long to get under the nose. The smallest attachment is too short for the length of the hair on my upper lip. Not bad for the money overall.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> easy to operate, small but powerful for use as a beard, eyebrow, ear, as well as a personal area trimmer.</li>
    <li> I wish the blades were a tad bit sharper, but it does the job....and it does it well. Between using the Andis T Liners and these I rarely go to barber shop anymore</li>
    <li> These clippers are very poor quality.  They pull the hair, they are very dull.  These clippers are very loud, the dog cannot stand the noise.  Unable to use.</li>
    <li> Easily the best value for money spent.  Well constructed...very solid, and compact.  Highly recommend this item for anyone looking for a trimmer ... AAA+++.</li>
    <li> I finally found it. In fact, a buddy I was rooming with in China got it from an ex publicist who said all her male clients used it. I see why, It&#x27;s wired, which sucks, but that&#x27;s ok, it is totally worth it! Trust me!!</li>
    <li> Box was just left outside my apartment building and when I found it it was open and nothing was inside.</li>
    <li> I use thisa item to trim my beard and it does a fine job. Works well and is well made and quite. I would definately order again.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews, and man did they hit the nail on the head. This little guy seems like it might be underpowered, and the fact that it&#x27;s food-shaped makes it appear as a novelty item, but it just plain works. I&#x27;ve gotten away from the battery powered shavers and trimmers, since they just don&#x27;t seem to have the power and they wear out within a year or so. This thing cuts through my mighty neck beard with ease. The guides work great too, they lock into place firmly for optimal beard trimming.</li>
    <li> Recomenneded by my barber.  Works great, best shave I have ever had and seems built very solid I love it</li>
    <li> Sent to my son for birthday and he couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Saves a lot on barber trips and is quick and easy to use.  He is always well groomed and confident now that his hairline looks its best.</li>
    <li> Overall I like the Peanut, however it&#x27;s not amazing. I previously had a battery powered trimmer I used, but when the guard broke I bought the Peanut for it&#x27;s small design and at the time I thought being purely a wall-plug trimmer would be a benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint about the Peanut is that the guards aren&#x27;t great for trimming facial hair. I primarily use this as a beard trimmer and the guards beyond the shortest setting make trimming your mustache incredibly difficult and unpleasant. That&#x27;s my main complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting quality is good and it can be used for facial hair as well as the hair on your head, if you&#x27;re patient, but it isn&#x27;t anything stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peanut has also convinced me my next trimmer will be battery powered again. As annoying as trimming and fighting a low battery is, having to deal with the cable is more of one. It&#x27;s a very thick cord and not very malleable, it holds shape and can knock things over on the bathroom counter quite easily while you&#x27;re focused on trimming your hair and not watching the cable.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper but probably best for caucasian or very smooth african american hair. My friend has very coarse &#x27;negro&#x27; hair and it just couldn&#x27;t do the job. Bought Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper instead based on a review from another site.</li>
    <li> I USE THESE CLIPPERS TO CUT MY BOBS!!!!! IT IS AMAZING AND WORKS VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it!! Yahoo! Finally something to cut threw his wires</li>
    <li> Love it. Best set of clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;m 35 and have been shaving my head since I was 12. I&#x27;ve been through quite a few sets in that time</li>
    <li> Worked great right out of the box.  No more charging my trimmer to trim my beard.</li>
    <li> Works great on trimming his beard and doesn&#x27;t pull his hair. He absolutely loves it! He said it mows right thru the beard and takes a quarter of the time to do. He has a full thick beard that he keeps trimmed to about 1/2&amp;#34; long.</li>
    <li> i love these trimmers. i buy them for my husband to maintain his beared. they stay sharp for a long time and the overall product last for a long time. i would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> love it ...best thing to happen to my beard yet</li>
    <li> u have to go over and over to really have a good cut i think  am going back to the ones i had before...</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the rave reviews, a friend had suggested it and I looked on here to get more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair short, I use a #2 all over and I generally would pick up a clipper set @ Walmart for $20 and use it for a year or so and replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to spend a few more bucks for this since it was rated so highly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tiny clippers pretty much sucks for everything aside from the \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; portion of the haircut. the blade area is so small it easily clogs up with hair. The only way it is really effective is if you cut your hair on a weekly basis and cut it when it&#x27;s still short. Kind of defeats the purpose, at least for my usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve gone back to the old cheap pair for cutting the main hair and my wife uses this toy to clean up the end of the haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite disappointed, should have just bought another $19.99 set @ walmart instead of this plastic piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just looking for a beard trimmer, this may be perfect, but for cutting hair it just sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat Emptor!</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer. It is sharp and has high rpm&#x27;s compared to cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. It would be nice if it came with a few more guards.</li>
    <li> el equipo cumple contodas las especificaciones que se establecen en el articulo, muy buen equipo, recomendado a los usuarios de los mismos</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this little bubble bee looking buzzer for about 5 months now I guess. I really lose track of time so easily. It is doing great. Just oil the blade up before use and shave through your tough face beard like there is no GD tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. Would recommend to my mother.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is my second Peanut, and I love them. The first lasted several years, and I expect the same from this one.</li>
    <li> solid and well made, 7ft cord,quality attachments,use to trim beard twice a week very nice</li>
    <li> I am a dude who has been cutting his own hair for 4 years this is what I have to say: these are supposed to be trimmers and NOT liners. So if you&#x27;re looking to line up your beard or head-hair, I would suggest that you get the Adis T. Outliner. It&#x27;s much sharper and made for that purpose. But if you just want something that will keep your facial or body hair short, then by all means, get this one. It works pretty good</li>
    <li> Having owned another Wahl clipper for many years, I am somewhat disappointed by the Peanut. My Wahl Designer is a very solid clipper that has performed admirably. I have my doubts about the Peanut, though. It has a flimsy feel and it doesn&#x27;t measure up to what I was expecting. Had I examined this clipper before deciding to buy it, I never would have.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my beard, and have for about 8 years.  My first one lasted about 6 years, and recently had to replace it.  I dropped it and broke the plastic blade holder.  I could have probably fixed it, but figured it was time.  It&#x27;s a nice size with a long power cord.</li>
    <li> Works great. Exactly as advertised, with a number of different attachments, so that you have a few options for bears length. The device is surprisingly small, but in a good way, as it&#x27;s quite effective.</li>
    <li> Cuts very close. Excellent for beard trimming, but take care when running without a guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peanut is much smaller than I was expecting! The cord when wrapped up is larger than the actual unit! It&#x27;s a good size for working the details.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my boyfriend. Fast delivery, item as seen on the site. Waiting for the boyfriend to give me the review on the product.</li>
    <li> u should def get one this is a great machine cuts clean and cuts close.  i would def grasb one.</li>
    <li> Received right away. Product as described. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Strong enough for cutting thick hair on head.&lt;br /&gt;Does not include real head combs as it is a beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Small enough width and head to allow surgical trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Well-made unit.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I am not a professional barber/stylist. I bought this trimmer for home personal use, and for that function I absolutely love it. I bought it to trim my beard, which I like to keep at about 1/4&amp;#34; length. I&#x27;ve had a beard for about 3 years now and have gone through at least 4 trimmers, none of which I liked. The regular home cordless beard trimmers have weak motors and dull blades. Both of those problems are solved by this Wahl Peanut trimmer. It has a very powerful motor and the blade is very sharp (so sharp you&#x27;ll want to watch how much pressure you put down when you&#x27;re trimming around the edges of your beard without a guard on it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the compact size of this machine is great. It fits perfectly and comfortably in the palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this trimmer sooner. After 3 years of searching I&#x27;ve finally found a beard trimmer I love.</li>
    <li> Excellent pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> Hands down best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. Very smooth, very thorough so it doesn&#x27;t miss any hairs. Excellent all around razor. One small issue and it doesn&#x27;t even bother me. The heads fit kind of strangely on the razor. Basically just make sure you apply pressure to the head and it will work like a dream. That way you&#x27;re 100% sure that it doesn&#x27;t fall off</li>
    <li> Best trimmer everrrrrrr.........</li>
    <li> I wish I bought this thing a year ago when I first heard about it. I use the longest guard and keep my beard trimmed to the length I like. I take the guard off and use it to clean up around the edges. It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. The little guy works great.</li>
    <li> works great. small size fits hands nicely.  Wish there was one size closer shave with attachments but otherwise, love it.</li>
    <li> For my wife, again.  She cuts hair professionally and loves this product.  It is of very high quality and lasts for years, if you take care of it.  Her last one still functions fine and she has had it for 4+ years.  It came with everything described in the product description and arrived promptly; no problems there.  If you&#x27;re a hair dresser, or even a parent that cuts their kids&#x27; hair and can afford this product (it was about $60 when I picked it up), I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to augment my aging (7 yr old) battery operated Wahl Beard.  This works well.  It trims very close without nicks.  I use it in lieu of a razor.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is a little inconvenient after using a battery operated unit, but the increased power more than makes up for it.&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned it to my barber and he said that he was very aware of the Peanut.  Said he recommends it to all of his bearded customers.  I got my feelings hurt that he didn&#x27;t mention it to me, but then I didn&#x27;t ask him.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimming tool. I almost docked a star due to lack of varied length options, but the pros far outweigh that single con. The small size really helps you hit certain angles that would be near impossible with a standard sized trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have used many trimmers and this is the winner for me. Great for taming all body hair. The little thing is powerful!</li>
    <li> I just use it to trim my beard. It does a great job. Quiet and sturdy. Feels like will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist. And these are my favorite trimmers. They last a long while while still staying sharp. It&#x27;s tiny so very easy to work with,&lt;br /&gt;especially in smaller areas like around the ears. I have used this brand of trimmer for over the past 5 yrs. and I will continue to use them in the future.</li>
    <li> This clipper is for short cuts period! The blade is way to small to handle longer hair. The blades are sharp and give you precision when doing shape-ups.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many clippers over the years, but these are the best for my hair length and texture. I bought the cordless one a few years back, but the battery power did not give the clipper half the power that it gets from being hard-wired. Overall, for under 40 bucks this is steal! The peanut is well worth every cent</li>
    <li> I love my Peanut. It is small enough to get in the hard to get spots, and fast enough to shave your whole head. It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My husband was trilled.  The hair stylist recommended it as she uses onr in the salon.  Everyone should use one..</li>
    <li> I use my Wahl Peanut to edge up my hairline between haircuts with pretty good success. Mostly I get uses of my trimmer for keeping my mustache and beard groomed. This is a well made trimmer but isn&#x27;t a replacement for full sized Hair Clippers, some of the other reviews gave it low rating because it isn&#x27;t a Hair Clipper. Right of the top this is a smaller trimmer that is pretty powerful for its size. Most negative reviews were mostly based on its size. There are cheaper trimmers but if you want quality I&#x27;d recommend the Wahl brand with the Peanut being a good product.</li>
    <li> i had an earlier version of the peanut and loved it. i had to replace it because i dropped it and broke but it&#x27;s still the same great product.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product recommended 100% I feel totally happy not hesitate to buy recommended ..... sending was done perfectly</li>
    <li> Our son in law prefers the unshaven look and requested these for Christmas.  He was delighted with them.  Amazon made the purchase painless...no getting in the car and traveling 30 miles in search of this item.</li>
    <li> I love this little thing. I&#x27;ve been buzzing my hair for about 8 years and I&#x27;ve gone though a few full size clippers and a couple facial hair clippers and I just wish I got this years ago. It&#x27;s smaller narrower and way lighter than a full size clipper but works better and faster for buzzing my hair and works great for facial hair too, because it cuts so close and makes such clean lines. The only downside I can really think of is that the cord is pretty thick and it&#x27;s heavy compared to the peanut itself. But a thicker cord means more power and this has plenty of that.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister for Christmas who is a hair stylist. She said if fits perfectly in her hand and works great. Other stylists that I have talked to said they wouldn&#x27;t use anything other than the Wahl Peanut.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a corded beard trimmer because I was tired of the battery on my cordless trimmers dying after one use. Read some reviews in various places, and the peanut sounded like a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Small&lt;br /&gt;- Corded, so no worries about battery life, and it runs powerfully.&lt;br /&gt;- The cable is really long.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to keep clean, the blade head comes off and on without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Great:&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t come with a guide small enough to trim your mustache. I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; as in hair length. I mean, the guides are just too big to fit under your nose. Kind of a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;- The teeth on the guides are fairly far apart, which is probably good for hair, but is not so great for beards, at least not for mine, with hair that is kind of wiry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the Peanut is a nice little tool. Probably better for trimming head-hair than beard-hair.</li>
    <li> Great results when using this Wahl.  I have no complaints thus far and can assure you that this machine can take a beating.  I used it to shave my head and to trim my beard prior to shaving.  Excellent result and no hair pulls.  The blades were top quality too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS! YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost sound like a Wahl employee, LOL, I&#x27;m not.  Though, I am one hell of a critic!</li>
    <li> Good clippers to own. Wish they would cut a little closer to the skin. Still a good product. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this to trim my beard. Wasn&#x27;t looking for anything fancy just something that I could use irregularly that didn&#x27;t need recharged.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great. Cuts pretty close and has good precision. It is easy to use and a very good buy.</li>
    <li> Always trust the Peanut!!! Been using one for almost 7 years. LOVE it. I will continue the use of this product and reccomend it as well. DELIVERED WITHIN 24 HOURS (!!!!) of ordering. Thank you WAHL.</li>
    <li> bought this for my brother. he got a new job so i bought this for a congrats. his barber uses this and he loved it so i surprised him with it. barber said i got a good deal with the price. they also come in other colors. i have seen black, white, pink and purple</li>
    <li> Totally worth it, if you have to use this regular.. this is one of the best choices for less than 40$</li>
    <li> It performs better than most clippers, but the plastic clip on the trimmer blade that helps secure it into the trimmer snapped easily after a few months of use.  It&#x27;s still workable but a bit loose, and I have to place my finger on it so it stays on properly while I use it.  It&#x27;s annoying that the part has this flimsy plastic part to it, and it broke only after a few months of use.  I take off the head to clean out hairs from the inside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also have to lubricate the blade once in a while too.</li>
    <li> I bought this on recommendation from TheWirecutter, and it did not disappoint. Extremely easy to use, great, even shave, and a steal at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5!</li>
    <li> I would give this little beauty 5 stars if the cutting guides were made of mental or a better quality plastic. I fear they wont last but so far so good. I treat them very carefully. Also, a 5th guide would be nice. The shortest is just a bit too short and the next size up is just a wee bit long for my beard . That being said, I am very happy with the handling and power. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a battery shaver like I did. The difference between battery and direct plug-in is night and day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get close enough. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for body trimming.</li>
    <li> I always had issues saving with a razor getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps. This is a beast and gives An amazing close shave !</li>
    <li> Great product if you need a good razor then buy this it is sturdy and reliable. gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Fantastic and easy to use. It is very loud, though.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace a different pair of trimmers that started to rust.  I&#x27;ve used this three times and it&#x27;s excellent  I shave my head so I first buzz everything and then shave (makes life easier).  I&#x27;ve been through about 3 different trimmers in the past few years and honestly I wish I spent a little extra and bought this instead.  I have thick afro-Italian hair so battery-operated trimmers make that slow down noise like when you mow a thick patch of grass but I haven&#x27;t had that with the Peanut yet.  I also haven&#x27;t had any hairs just pulled out and less irritation afterwards.  My only real complaint is that I wish it could get closer to my skin, since I normally shave, but it gets pretty close, closer than my last trimmer with the same size blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Good heft for a small trimmer&lt;br /&gt;* Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t pull hair&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to handle (due to size)&lt;br /&gt;* Corded, so there&#x27;s no slow down when cutting thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Hair can still get between the blade and the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;* Cord can feel a little short depending on your setup (or where your outlet is)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use the oil included and to clean it out once you are done to ensure the blade stays sharp!</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the Peanut&#x27;s tiny size and light weight, but it&#x27;s powerful. Used without a guide, it gave a closer buzz than our previous clipper. It&#x27;s also quite a bit louder. All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> trims like a champ, using for beard - a little loud and strong vibrations for a little thing, but works well for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> Powerful beard trimmer. Works great on my beard. I found this trimmer through The Sweethome, who recommended it, and I would as well.</li>
    <li> this is a excellent shaver and for a very good price, very satisfied with it, it comes with good guards also, worth $60 got it for nearl half price, yu wouldnt go wrong buying this</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T USE A SHAVER, SO I USE THIS AND IT CUTS DOWN VERY CLOSE LIKE A FIVE O&#x27;CLOCK SHADOW. I LOVE IT  I CAN SHAVE IN ABOUT 3 MINUTES NOW. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, EVEN MY BARBER USES IT.</li>
    <li> I bought these solely on the review rating and feedback as to how good they were. I used them once and they cut my neck and face a bunch of times. I&#x27;m not sure how everyone else says they&#x27;re so good and don&#x27;t pull hair or cut the skin because they do. I never shave my face and neck down the skin so I&#x27;ve always used trimmers. These are by far the worst I&#x27;ve ever purchased. However it is my fault for not going with the other clippers I had that recently died. Dumb of me trying to save money. I am thoroughly disappointed in these.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer you could ever buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a retired hairstylist, and used the peanut at work.  It has the power of the large clippers, but with this, I could clean up neck hairs that grow down, and do the regular clipper cut work.  Now, I&#x27;m retired and just bought this for the guy friend.  He uses it for his beard timing and loves it.  Lasts a long time, even if used at work.  For home use, probably will work on and on forever.  Just have to take proper care of it, cleaning, and keeping lubricated.</li>
    <li> just a awesome trimmer  always trim before i shave</li>
    <li> Good clippers, just wish it had a few more attachments.</li>
    <li> excellent product, highly recommend</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  No power.  Need bigger trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great trimer for Italian beards. trims without a single neck.</li>
    <li> My original trimmer ran thru batteries like water thru a funnel. This trimmer is a plug in and is just the right size for trimming my beard. Price is good and trimmer works great.</li>
    <li> Hands down best beard trimmer of all time. Tons of power for such a tiny little maneuverable device. It&#x27;s a classic for a reason.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer clipper I ever had. I have been using it for 2-3 years. it is small but powerful. It is always ready and does a great job.</li>
    <li> First impression: Pretty small, good reviews EVERYWHERE i look. Looks kinda cute, don&#x27;t completely like the idea of it being peanut shaped, it doesn&#x27;t seem very professional. But as soon as you hold it you realize wow, this was MADE for your hand. Try any other one, and you&#x27;ll feel the difference is clear, the peanut feels great in your hand, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like your using just a tiny little thing, it feels high quality. Cleaning instructions are easy to use. Peanut vibrates a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second professional quality clipper set i&#x27;ve owned. The other is an Andis Ultra set. Price of that set was 35 bucks. This set was 45 for me in total. Without a doubt there is a quality difference i noticed. More money gives you more powerful motors and more efficient motors. There are 3 main brands, you might hear otherwise from other people, but the top brands i look for are oster, andis, and wahl. Oster being the top of the line, and andis and wahl have competitive products. Its when they try and make inexpensive at home clippers for 10-20 dollars that it scares me. It sort of kills their names because they make them with inferior products to get their name out there. Anyways if you buy one of these you&#x27;ll be very pleased from what i can tell. I highly suggest you follow the instructions to maintain the unit for long life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts: Cord length is fine, long enough for whatever i need. Color i went with was black, for no reason what so ever other than the fact that there were about 12 white ones and 1 black one and i had to be different :-P. Vibration is a little annoying at first, but not a big deal. Powers through facial hair and doing trimming around my ears and neck. Gets a little warm but not as warm as an oster i used to use to do goat hair, but then again that was an entirely different operation ;-).</li>
    <li> I got these trimmers for personal use. The trimmer does a great job of trimming my beard, mustache, and facial hair I want to remove.  Has lots of power and zooms through my beard.  Much better than portables I had before.  The only thing I wish it had were more cutting guides.  I prefer my beard a little bit longer, but that is a minor thing.  Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this clipper/trimmer for over 20 years.  Since I work in the children&#x27;s hair industry it is especially helpful.  It does the work of a clipper in a compact size, perfect for getting around smaller heads.  When I am done, no need to switch over to a trimmer as the peanut accomplishes this too.  Love the new black color and this little machine holds up. Working with kids, I do haircut after haircut and it wreaks havoc on my tools but the wahl peanut just keeps buzzing.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works great and cuts through hair without hesitation. It excels using the blade guards - using it without them is a little risky and won&#x27;t yield as close a shave as a razor more designed for that. I find the trimmer guards to be a bit sharp and not the most comfortable when it is used as a beard trimmer. On the whole this small trimmer feels high quality and I expect it to last a very long time!</li>
    <li> Veeery close razor, don&#x27;t use on hair because it&#x27;s not strong enough for volume of hair, but other than that it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> I was tired of replacing trimmers because the rechargeable batteries would eventually die and the last one I had would not allow me to use it while charging - ughh!  So, I wanted a corded trimmer and this little one is great.  Very powerful, long cord, and easy to use.  I do wish it would have a better selection of trim-depth guides packaged with it because I find I only use the shortest one and would like to trim my beard even slightly shorter.  But, it works great - I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great, but not easy to clean because of the foam pad. It has plenty of power for both beard and hair trimming. The attachments are robust.</li>
    <li> powerful lil clippers a lil loud but im impressed</li>
    <li> I had always used a rechargeable trimmer and got tired of having to charge it in advance so I wanted an electric.  I use the trimmer to trim face hair as close as the trimmer will cut.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I like the trimmer.  My  hair dresser recommended it. The only problem I have is it is hard to use on very thick hair.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist told me about it.  She uses it, and it works great!</li>
    <li> delivery was quick and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;too new to give 5 stars so for now it&#x27;ll get 4&lt;br /&gt;currently runs great.  I&#x27;ve had the peanut before and hopefully&lt;br /&gt;this one lasts longer.  Like the new round grip at the base.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to use.well made,I like it.would recommend it to any one looking for a trimmer.I got it shipped in record time</li>
    <li> Works great- my boyfriend loves it</li>
    <li> This works exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s powerful, solidly built, and easy to use.  It&#x27;s small and stores away easily.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is in school for cosmotology and she always talked about this so I got it for her for Christmas and she loves it. I guess it makes things easier like shaping up the sides and out of the box it seems very durable.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my husband who has a beard he likes to keep trimmed. This is awesome! It was recommended by his professional hairstylist and is the product she uses. The attachments work great.  He had a wireless clipper in the past but couldn&#x27;t get the power he needed- though this has  plug it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my Peanut.  It is very powerful, yet so lightweight.  It&#x27;s surprising how they put this much power in such a small machine!</li>
    <li> This is a great little product that you can use it to keep yourself or family members looking neat and tidy between haircuts.  It&#x27;s small enough to be used by anyone and it takes very little room to store.  The attachments are great, too.</li>
    <li> have only used once, but was really nice. so easy to use.</li>
    <li> The Wahl peanut is very easy to use and very powerful. It is very light so it is great for travelers.</li>
    <li> After four months of use these clippers made a &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; noise and quit. Very disappointed, especially given the price. Oiled/cleaned daily with regular use as beard trimmer. DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect hair cutter, all i need faster and without a problem, i recommend this Peanut, i&#x27;m glad because my beard lookks great!</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my beard edged and trimmed.  It works flawlessly.  I expect it to last a good, long time under normal use.  If I manage to break it, however, I&#x27;ll be back for another one.</li>
    <li> Strong little clipper.Very sharp so be careful not to pinch when cutting in to trim.A little loud but not obnoxious.Looks like it will last a long time.A storage pouch would have been nice.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a no-frills beard and moustache trimmer with a cord that was simple to use and maintain and would operate reliably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the Peanut:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Peanut for two months and, so far, it meets my expectations. It is considerably more powerful and has a larger blade than the Wahl cordless trimmer that I used before the Peanut. One nice thing about a trimmer with a cord is that it doesn&#x27;t run slower (and pull hairs) as the battery drains.. The Peanut fits nicely in my hand. It is easy to clean and does a nice job trimming my moustache with one of the four attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about the Peanut:&lt;br /&gt;There are only four attachments and three of them are not useful to me. The one that I use cuts my beard a little shorter than what I would like and the next size up doesn&#x27;t trim close enough (I have a relatively short beard). I use the Peanut without an attachment to trim hair on my neck under my beard and on my cheeks above my beard. It doesn&#x27;t seem to trim as close as the Wahl cordless that I previously used.</li>
    <li> The trimmers I use with the children a few decades ago finally found their resting place (recycled).  My hair stylist recommend the Wahl Peanut for trimming my beard and these are great.  The small size make them easy to handle, and they don&#x27;t leave your ears ringing after you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent unit, that is all that i can say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Comfortable, light and powerful for a small unit.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Small unit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> works great for pads and poodle feet</li>
    <li> Most powerful small precision trimmers.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. There&#x27;s no need at all to spend more money on a fancier razor.</li>
    <li> I just wish that it had longer attachements that allowed it to reach beyond 1/2 an inch</li>
    <li> great little trimmer!</li>
    <li> Head to toe. Light weight &amp; powerful</li>
    <li> I first heard of the Wahl Peanut years ago when it was mentioned on a machine embroidery forum.  Many machine embroiders used it to \\&quot;erase\\&quot; embroidery mistakes.  I used mine successfully for this exact thing but then found it also worked well to shave matted fur off of my two long-haired cats.  It was the perfect size for a job like this, as they would get matted right down to the fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only recently that I began living with a small dog who needs regular grooming.  The other night I snapped one of the blade guards on the Peanut and ended up trimming her fur.  I suspect she was so cooperative because the trimmer wasn&#x27;t too big or too loud and didn&#x27;t vibrate too much.  She ended up looking much better with her new short haircut.  I don&#x27;t fancy myself as good as a professional dog groomer, but I was pleased that this little Peanut was up to the job of smartening up a 15-lb. dog -- especially since I was told afterwards that her coat has been responsible for the demise of other dog clippers.</li>
    <li> Nice little trimmer. Gets close without any problem. All in all a  thumbs up</li>
    <li> This is a real commercial grade trimmer that they use in salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much better than the junk that is marketed to non-professional consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to anyone who is considering use for beard trimming, or in lieu of getting the junky ones described above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I have with it is that the prongs on the combs are too long for me to trim my mustache under my nose and I have to use scissors for that.</li>
    <li> But if you use it for more than a few minutes, the motor warms up and sometimes slows..  I think it is designed for the quick trim and works great for that.</li>
    <li> I really like how close it gets....just watch out, it will cut skin too.  Very good product, much better than ones in general retail.</li>
    <li> This is my second peanut and I&#x27;m looking forward to another ten years. These are very strong clippers and would recommend them to anyone who needs compact and portable clippers.</li>
    <li> My previous Peanut was not even broken....I honestly can&#x27;t remember when I purchased it, but it was well over 10 years ago. I had lost or broken all the guards and I just decided it was about time to replace. I&#x27;m amazed at this product! I have to admit, I severely neglected my old one....I could count on one hand how many times I oiled it in all that time...and i subjected it to much abuse. Nevertheless, the motor kept going like it was relatively new, and the blades cut with precision. This is truly a quality product and I&#x27;m hoping they haven&#x27;t lost anything in the manufacturing over time. So far, it was worked exactly as my previous.</li>
    <li> This was my first time shopping on Amazon and overall I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and fast delivery. I&#x27;m a barber in TN and I know other barbers who use this trimmer. I&#x27;ve been told the Peanut is a must-have, but I was skeptical of it because it looks like a toy to me compared to trimmers like the Andis T-Outliner/Outliner II among others. Long story short, I decided to give it a shot and these trimmers are worth the investment. They&#x27;re great for edgeups (especially on kids), but I still prefer my modified T-Outliner and Outliner II trimmers with the Pro-Mate blade for adult edgeups as they prove to be more efficient. I&#x27;m not sure how well the Peanut does on designs yet but I&#x27;ll find out soon enough. The Peanut will get you and your clients very crispy, so don&#x27;t feel misled. If you&#x27;re on a budget and looking for a quality trimmer the Peanut is definitely a good start. I recommend this trimmer to anyone who cuts hair either for personal use or professionally, and I will be shopping with this seller again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Everything I just stated above.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I just wish the cord was a little bit longer 0_o</li>
    <li> Great little clipper! It is small but powerful.</li>
    <li> Best small trimmers around.</li>
    <li> No where near as well built as the Wahl full size clippers.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this clipper. It does it work and gives him nice, close cut which is desired for his line of work. Thank you for offering this gadget.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for beard trimming but the attachments are for hair cutting.</li>
    <li> It is very small, however it is very powerfull.It cuts low and I sometimes use it to cut my beard since I have areas wereingrown hairs happen. This machine cuts so low that I get ingrwn hairsif I cut low with it. That is not a downfall, it just means it can cut low without cutting your skin. I love the machine.</li>
    <li> My sister is a cosmetologist and recommended this - the pros have been using this for years!  Powerful, smooth, small and agile - perfect for trimming beards!  Only wish the #2 guide had shorter rails - keep poking myself in the nose!!</li>
    <li> I first started growing a beard a few months ago, and after deciding I liked it and wanted to keep it I needed to find a quality trimmer to keep it well groomed and looking professional. I had a cheap remmington trimmer at first, then I read several reviews that brought me upon the phillips norelco brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while those may be fine for some, they just weren&#x27;t powerful enough (granted they had more features, but I only needed a strong trimmer for 1/2 inch) Anyway that&#x27;s when I read reviews and found this wonderful trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some may fund the fact that it only has four guards and that it&#x27;s corded as a con, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect for me and my 1/2 inch beard. The small size yet power of the trimmer helps get behind the ears, and everywhere else while being powerful enough to cut it more evenly than any other trimmer yet.</li>
    <li> A little on the high side but works like a professional trimmer and way better than battery powered options.</li>
    <li> A very powerful and easy to use clipper!  I have a drawer full of clippers that gave out or became dull in a short time.  I&#x27;m sure this Peanut will never see the inside of that drawer!</li>
    <li> Very powerful ! As much power as a full size one.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to groom his beard.  Works great. He loves it.  Much easier to use than his full size Wahl trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent, my husband was very pleased I bought this for him. He uses it for shaving body hair around the chest, hand, legs.  He was so pleased to have them and complimented that it is the best shaving tool he ever had.</li>
    <li> like it,but it too noise.</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s old one broke, so this was a replacement of the same brand.  He is very pleased.</li>
    <li> Thought the would be sharper .. like flesh cutting Sharp lol . The shipping was perfect. And the clippers are nice. O.k. at trimming my hair.  I have thin straight curly hair. So its easy to trim. But with these it gives me kind of a home made shaven look.non professional.  Im not really feeling that. But they Will do their job</li>
    <li> the hubster is quite happy with this, and now I don&#x27;t have to do it for him. A win-win. :)</li>
    <li> Powerful and works like it should. Easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Sorry for the one star.  I bought it for the specific purpose of trimming hair mats off of my Persian kitty cat.  Using scissors often cut skin, so I was looking for a safer alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried and tried and could not get this tool to do any good in trimming off kitty cat mats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has some good information on a tool that would work for this job, please let me know.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer is awesome! I used to spend so much money just to get shape ups at the barber shop and line trim my beard but now I save money And just do it at home! Works great for trimming armpits or any unwanted hair!</li>
    <li> Best trimmer on the market. I&#x27;ve used many different Wahl trimmers from the basic all purpose hair trimmer I use on my kids and dog to the cordless battery trimmer for beards and faces to the Balder and this peanut beats them all hands down. First off I use this peanut trimmer primarily on my face and neck with no height guards….zero height I guess. It gives the closest &#x27;day old&#x27; shave look out of anything I&#x27;ve used, even the balder couldn’t compare. In fact, this peanut has so much power you could bald your entire head with it. This peanut is powerful, quality materials, and very fine close cutting blades. There are however a few things I don’t quite like. One thing is it is very light; very light….so light that the stiffness of the cord will move it on the countertop….like a mouse that is too light weight. I actually can&#x27;t believe how strong and powerful this thing is for how light it is….but it is. The cord stiffness is the next thing, I guess because this is a commercial product it has to have a commercial cord, and it does….thick heavy strong cord, the kind of cord that comes on a dewalt drill, no kidding. I may actually try and swap the cord out with a lightweight coffee maker cord or something…..and I don’t really care about warranty because I don’t think you can do anything to this thing that could really hurt to the point it couldn’t be fix and even so it&#x27;s on $30 dollars. So with those two things I dislike I would still go and buy another one of these today if this one were to disappear, so still five stars all the way. You&#x27;ll see what I mean as soon as you use it.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. I even use them to shave down my beard hair when it gets too long and annoying</li>
    <li> Love them, they are in the middle of the road of the larger hair razors and a tiny beard trimmer. Great for a full beard.</li>
    <li> Sturdy construction, simple design, with an ergonomic fit to the hand.  This diminutive trimmer feels comfortably natural in the hand and is easy to grip and move around the face for effortless beard, burns, and brow trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are of a noticeably higher quality than lower cost rechargeable units, and you can really feel the confident power of the AC driven motor.  Easy to clean and maintain, and swapping attachments is quick.  The comb guides mount securely and firmly stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included brush works well to clean the blades, and the power cord is adequately long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1/8&amp;#34; guide works well for 2 week stubble, and the 1/4&amp;#34; did a nice smooth job of trimming my eyebrows that tend to grow on the wizardly side. :)</li>
    <li> the small snap that hold the blades on broke after a couple of years, it could have been sturdier for sure, other than that it works great.</li>
    <li> I frikken love this thing!! It&#x27;s exactly what I needed and better than ANY other trimmer I&#x27;ve used or is our there. I use it to trim all my body hair because I hate it and it&#x27;s literally perfect! Had it for a long time now and whenever it goes down I&#x27;m defiantly picking up the SAME EXACT peanut Wahl trimmer. Why? Because I LOVE IT! That&#x27;s why!!!</li>
    <li> These do a very good job of trimming. They cut very close (be careful if you&#x27;re using them against the grain or you could actually cut yourself) and do not pull at all. The cord can get in the way a little bit if you&#x27;re using them on yourself, but it gives them a lot of power to work with. Also, I have very large hands and these are still comfortable to me.</li>
    <li> great trimmer. exceeds expectations.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Professional 8655-200 Peanut (with cord) is a nifty device.  I researched and hemmed and hawed about the various options for beard trimmers.  I&#x27;m not a full-fledged beard man.  I had a beard for a couple of years twenty years ago, and I recently grew one because I was simply sick of shaving.  I am bothered by beards as they grow much of the time, and if I was to experiment with keeping this newly fashioned growth, I wanted something that would allow me to keep my beard relatively short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sifting through reviews ain&#x27;t easy.  There&#x27;s lots of conflicting information, and oftentimes for every two people who like it, there&#x27;s another group who hates it.  Some claim that certain trimmers don&#x27;t catch, while other posters insist that those same trimmers painfully do.  It&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s what, particularly for someone like myself who hasn&#x27;t owned a trimmer in two decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be sure, I had a preference for a cordless trimmer, largely because I travel a lot and when my beard grows even for just half a week, it starts getting too long for my comfort, particularly around my mustache and on my jowls.  Time and again, however, I discovered consistent reviews irrespective of device that cordless trimmers simply didn&#x27;t have the power that corded ones do.  When the power is weak, that&#x27;s often when trimmers catch and pull.  Who needs that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to claim that the Peanut does everything for all people with whatever kind of beard.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t know.  What I will report is that after using a half dozen times, it&#x27;s not caught or pulled, there&#x27;s been no pain, and it cuts through my hair with relative ease and joy.  Truth be told, I&#x27;m among the lowest maintenance beard boasters out there.  I don&#x27;t worry about &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; or sharpness.  I don&#x27;t do tricks, and I&#x27;m not terribly sophisticated with my use.  It&#x27;s too much hassle and it&#x27;s simply not who I am.  I just want my beard short.  For this, it&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my purposes, (even if equal in power) a cordless trimmer is unnecessary.  I use the trimmer for a few minutes approximately every three or four days.  I have also used it to neaten the hairline around my ears (be careful!).  A cordless trimmer would be easier when traveling -- and I haven&#x27;t traveled with the Peanut as of yet -- but I only use one attachment -- the 1/8&amp;#34;, so the bulk factor isn&#x27;t daunting for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is one thing that borders on the disappointing it is the four attachments.  As I&#x27;ve reported above, I&#x27;ve only used the shortest one.  In actuality, I would prefer an even shorter one.  The 1/8&amp;#34; attachment is longer than a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow; it&#x27;s still a full-fledged beard.  I&#x27;d probably like something in between the shadow and what I currently have, but with this Peanut, it&#x27;s not readily possible absent brilliant technique.  The Conair Beard Trimmer (can&#x27;t recall the model) is one that supposedly does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with many of these trimmers is that none is available locally.  Target had a few but none that appealed.  I could not find the Peanut locally, and even for a few bucks more, I prefer to buy locally instead of using Amazon.  When I buy locally -- even at Wal-Mart -- at least I&#x27;m paying the salaries of my neighbors who use that money locally to build our local economy.  For years, Amazon was against paying sales tax in states, and I believe still avoids doing so in many jurisdictions.  Amazon doesn&#x27;t give two craps about your community; it cares about its bottom line and its shareholders.  For this reason alone, I avoid Amazon when possible.  In this case, it wasn&#x27;t possible.  Even most of Target&#x27;s line of trimmers was only available online, and the Peanut was not among them.  So, yes, I am a verified Amazon purchaser of this product, and, no, I did not receive it for free because I&#x27;m a regular reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that even with the one minor drawback and the lack of cordlessness, I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.  I cannot attest to the longevity of this device, as I&#x27;ve only had it for several weeks.  Still, it does mostly what I want it to.  It&#x27;s a no-frills, missionary-position type of trimmer, but it gets the job done with aplomb.  The glowing reviews for the Wahl Peanut are well-deserved.  It isn&#x27;t very often that I find myself exuding joy at the supreme functionality of something I&#x27;ve bought.  In this case, I do.  I can&#x27;t speak to the Conair (which was likely my second choice), but it would be hard for me to imagine liking it as much as I do . . . which is odd for me, because I could very easily find myself beardless in another two weeks, and yet I&#x27;d still be delighted about this device and its functionality.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t exactly do what I&#x27;d prefer it do (shorter cut), I still am supremely delighted with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Had for almost half a year and works great. Gets a nice, close trim without any attachments. Perfect for cutting down a thick beard in preparation for a shave.</li>
    <li> Okay clippers for taping / trimming. better for young kids then Adults. They just aren&#x27;t shape enough, but if you press hard enough... you&#x27;ll get a decent trim.</li>
    <li> Our hair stylist would always trim my fiance&#x27;s neck with this little buzzer-trimmer and he would be &amp;#34;fur free&amp;#34; for about 3 to 4 weeks. In between hair cuts, when the fur grew back, it annoyed him.  He tried using his traditional safety razor to keep clean, but that&#x27;s the quickest way to dull your blade.  So we purchased this little guy and he&#x27;s been a happy camper ever since!  He thought that it might be ok to use on his face (rather than the safety razor) but it&#x27;s NOT made for this.  Don&#x27;t be stupid ... read the directions if you need to see it in black and white!</li>
    <li> This was reviewed by the Wirecutter as the best beard trimmer, but I haven&#x27;t really been overly impressed. It&#x27;s quite loud and vibrates like crazy. The blades also rusted much faster than blades on other cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past (but that may be due to usage). I do like how it doesn&#x27;t need to be charged, but it seems especially effective at scattering hair as far as possible. Also, the guides seem to be spaced too far apart, so if you were looking for something with small incremental guides this might not be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it cut hair? Sure does. Does it cut hair any better than most of the cordless hair trimmers? I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v been shaving my head for the last 8 years with regular clippers &amp; then someone mentioned &amp;#34;the PEANUT&amp;#34;, I  bought it.&lt;br /&gt;WOW, were have you been these last 8 years  ????&lt;br /&gt;The price is great &amp; it works super well. It&#x27;s a very small investment for the amount of time and grief you&#x27;ll save.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts really tight to the skin &amp; it&#x27;s fast !&lt;br /&gt;With my regular clippers it would take me 30 min on average to feel like I&#x27;m satisfied, due to the fact that I had to keep going over &amp; over the troubles spots. But with the PEANUT it took me 10 min &amp; it looks better than ever, easy.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who shaves there head.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome for its size. has more power than some full size trimmers that I have owned in the past. I use it mainly to trim my beard, but would have no hesitation to cut hair with it. And at about the same price as the lower end models whal sells in stores, it is a great value.</li>
    <li> Clipper is the size of your palm and very easy to use. Great for use on&lt;br /&gt;the dog&#x27;s face and for hair between pads on feet.  They are a little&lt;br /&gt;loud (high pitched) and can make your dog nervous.</li>
    <li> They work well.  I use them to trim my beard.  They are small and handy.  I like them and would buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles</li>
    <li> I believed the hype &amp;#34;powerful!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;sharp lines!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;best trimmers that I ever used!&amp;#34;. here is truth: I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Fried my last one in Salsburg, Austria with their 220 volt system plugs. ( thats my fault ) .This is my 2nd very high quality trimmer (made in the U.S.A.) Considered the cordless - but went with the plug in instead. My first trimmer was about 5 years old - was used almost daily, and worked flawlessly with very little noise.</li>
    <li> Very powerful trimmer. I use the largest setting to trim my beard. It look clean and still has a fullness look to it.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of clippers - comfortable to hold, even with small hands, and easy to control.  You will still need a nice edger for your beard, goatee, mustache or sideburns.  I review a nice complementary edger from Norelco in a separate review.</li>
    <li> I am not a barber or hair stylist.  I bought this for home use and it is small enough to be stored easily in my bathroom travel bag, and seems strong enough and commercial enough to last me forever as long as I remember to keep up on maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason I gave it 4 stars is because the cord is shorter than what I need.  Another reason is that I was hoping to be able to trim my face shorter than the guard included with this.</li>
    <li> It really works great, I guess I didn&#x27;t visualize just how small it really is but all of the measurements were listed so I&#x27;m not really complaining. I purchased it to cut my hair and I like to keep my head shaved down to stubble and it does just that but with the small size it takes a bit longer than it did with my last cutter.</li>
    <li> I consider myself hair inept, but I&#x27;ve used these clippers twice now to give myself a faux hawk and I&#x27;ve been given heaps of compliments.  I prepared by watching some youtube tutorials on how to do the cut.  These clippers have paid for themselves now and all my haircuts from here on out are FREE.</li>
    <li> I will preface this by saying that I should have researched the comb attachments a bit more before buying this trimmer.  The product has great reviews and was highly recommended by reddit users.  My battery trimmer died on me recently and I was looking for something with a good reputation and long lasting potential.  When it arrived I immediately noticed that the smallest 1/8th inch comb attachment was not short enough to achieve a close shave look for my beard.  After researching, I found many 1/16th inch combs for full size Wahl trimmers but upon contacting the company they advised that the 1/8th inch comb is the smallest attachment for the Peanut model.  I understand that this is my fault for not researching the attachments before purchasing.  This product is not advertised as a beard trimmer, so it&#x27;s understandable that they don&#x27;t provide a smaller comb for close beard shaves.  I really like the trimmer, it is powerful and I see the potential for a good trim....I just need to figure out how to mod the thing now to get that close beard shave.  I tried shaving my beard with no comb attachments, however it was mildly painful and did not produce consistent hair length cuts.  If you are considering buying this product for the same reason as me, I would consider a different product that is made for achieving a close beard shave (under 1/8th inch).</li>
    <li> Great product / good price</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully without any sudden &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34; to tender areas!</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer . Small and made well .Very  happy with this purchase .</li>
    <li> Small, lightweight and does the job  saves me trip to the barber and $$$$</li>
    <li> This stuff got burnt upon plugging. This happened the same minute it came. I had no opportunity to try it. It was dead on arrival! I think the voltage needs revisiting.</li>
    <li> Its a great trimmer... You can use it on your face with no worries at all... almost like you shaved</li>
    <li> Lots of power! I have a wookie beard! This thing is great! No more lost charger or wait time !!&lt;br /&gt;I am REAL hard on re- chargeable units. Will be interesting to see how long this clipper lasts!!</li>
    <li> it works great, definitely support getting wired clippers. could only wish that there were a few more sizes to use. i only use one</li>
    <li> Good Trimmer, but falls apart after the first year.</li>
    <li> It works really well  in fact better than the battery operated kind.</li>
    <li> Hands down the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. Bought these for general manscaping, the same routine I&#x27;ve has for over a decade now, to replace some aging battery powered trimmers that don&#x27;t hold a charge well anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face with no guard they plucked more hair than they cut. Very painful. What they did cut was long and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my body, they bogged down in moderate chest hair and missed quite a bit with the #3 guard on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On more sensitive areas, they cut me. So that was lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money or risk injury. Maybe they&#x27;re better at trimming head hair, but after the mangling they did to my body, I won&#x27;t let them near me again.</li>
    <li> Clippers are a bit loud, but work fine. The real issue is with the guards. The plastic doesn&#x27;t clip on well, and, over time, they stop staying on properly. I took a divot to my beard today and had to shave it off. This could have easily happened on top of my head as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just need something for edging, go ahead and buy these. If you plan to use the guards to trim to length, I suggest you continue shopping.</li>
    <li> LOVE this trimmer. I&#x27;ve always wanted to practice lining up my beard and this was definitely the product to do so.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer in the world</li>
    <li> HELLO I SURPRISED MY SON WITH THIS GIFT HE LOVES IT IT MEETS HIS EXPECTATIONS WELL THANKS JEFF KENNEY&#x27;S DAD FROM LOWELL MA THIS WAS NOT EASY TO FIND THIS OUR AREA STORES KHOLE&#x27;S WALLY MART THE GIG STORE SAM&#x27;S OF THE BIG BIG STORE IN SALEM NEWHAMPSHIRE OFF CLIFF CROSSING RD SALEM NH.  KMART SALEM NEWHAMPSHIRE NO ONE HAD THIS ITEM SO I DID TELL FROENDS WHERE I GOT OIT SO AMAZON IS GREAT THERE COMIONG TO OUR AREA HERE THEY ARE BUILDING A GIANT WHAREHOUSE OFF ROUTE 128 GREAT</li>
    <li> I was sick to death of messing around with rechargeable trimmers that could never get through a usage on a charge, and whose batteries degrade over time.  I also have little use for little fiddly attachments of unclear purpose.  This is just a high quality basic trimmer in a small size, perfect for my beard.  Includes #1, #2, #3 and #4 guards, what else do you need?  Works great for me, and no stupid rechargeable batteries to wear out!</li>
    <li> I have been doing hair for over 40 yrs. This is one of the best zero cut cliper I have ever owned. Purchas it becaue we have a lot of customer who want zero cut head shaves and this cliper does the job very quickly, And the price was realy good like halph what the beauty supply charges for the exact same cliper.</li>
    <li> Much better than the under powered cordless trimmers I have used in the past. Price was much lower also.</li>
    <li> Powerful, great size. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Excellent high quality pair of clippers. I was looking for clippers that I could get a close shave on my head as possible, something my larger set couldn&#x27;t accomplish. These work perfectly and I use them every week to keep a clean shave. I also use them to line up and detail when I cut my son&#x27;s hair, and they work perfectly for that as well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wore out the sideburn trimmer on my last shaver because I used it to trim by beard. No more. I will echo the other good reviews for Wahl. Appears well built, and a cord definitely adds to the torque power. I saw the difference in battery and cord in my last two shavers. I do prefer a cord for home use.</li>
    <li> this cuts your hair good, good for sideburns good for all kinds of fun and works all kinds of ways</li>
    <li> Very powerfull and easy to use</li>
    <li> I had a white peanut for 3 years and it had been dropped several times, and started to get a little loud. So I wanted to replace it. This black peanut doesnt work as well as  my old one.  It sounds like it struggles at times, just not as powerful as my first one in white???</li>
    <li> Very powerful little clippers!</li>
    <li> have worked as hairdresser for ffity years, used a lot of clippers good and bad,,could not wait to get a peanut,,because everyone i know loved thiers,,,well it is to small for my hands,,,very uncomfortable to hold,would only recoment to people with little hands,,,,women  ,,,to small for most mans hands</li>
    <li> I shave my head but I don&#x27;t like to shave it down to the skin.  I like just a little hair.  This trimmer comes set exactly perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Best hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I use this to trim my beard. During a previous haircut, I asked the professional cutting my hair for her advice on what she thinks is the best trimmer available. Without hesitation, she said the Wahl Peanut is the way to go. She was right. It fits perfectly in my hand, has great power, and comes with enough attachments to cut my hair to any length.</li>
    <li> quality trim, easily stored, highly recommended, no fade ability</li>
    <li> I love these! I had done a ton of research and initially decided on the Andis SlimLine 2 Trimmer with T-Blade. I brought them home and was disappointed. They weren&#x27;t powerful and didn&#x27;t cut that well. I returned them and bought the Wahl Peanut. Love them! They are more powerful and leave a much cleaner line when lining up my goatee.</li>
