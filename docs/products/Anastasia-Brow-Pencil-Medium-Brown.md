      <li>AOBH is the most natural looking pencil on the market, it stays in place, its only 20 some dollars and lasts for about a year and it come in a variety of colors.</li>
      <li>The brush included on the opposite end is convenient and just the right size.</li>
      <li>I wear the dark in winter and light in summer.</li>
      <li>The pencil feels dry, not as fresh as the ones I tried in the store, which is probably why it&#x27;s cheaper to buy it here.</li>
      <li>for the most natural look don&#x27;t touch the pencil to you face too hard rather flick the pencil upward and outward at all times.</li>
      <li>but this pencil looks so natural on the brow.  </li>
      <li>i bought the medium ash, very nice color and looks very natural, but very dry and difficult to use.</li>
      <li>It stays on much longer than other ones Ive tried.</li>
      <li>I typically put on too much and then turn the spooly around and wipe it off.</li>

    <li> Does not ride smoothly.</li>
    <li> I love anastasia products, I don&#x27;t go anywhere without my brows done! They stay on even through heavy exercise. But I have to say after trying the powder, pencil and twist up, the twist applicator is my favorite. After buying the pencil twice, I&#x27;m now converting over to the twist up applicator. I get much nicer results, the fine end allows for more control and precision. Best of luck!</li>
    <li> After receiving this pencil, my face is forever changed [for the better].</li>
    <li> Best brow pencil EVER.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve used</li>

    <li> Have used this product for a long time and am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have always used the Anastasia eye brow products. I love it. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very natural color but not useful for those who dont have brow hairs will look grayish</li>
    <li> Anastasia of BH is the best pencil I have ever used and I have seen them all. I seen this on the Oprah show years and years ago. She said it was her favorite and I was desperate and I decided to try it and to my surprise I was happy and I am the worlds fussiest person about eyebrows. AOBH is the most natural looking pencil on the market, it stays in place, its only 20 some dollars and lasts for about a year and it come in a variety of colors. I have two-dark brown and light brown. I wear the dark in winter and light in summer. The application is very smooth, it glides on so soft. I typically put on too much and then turn the spooly around and wipe it off. I like a thick brow look. TIP:for the most natural look don&#x27;t touch the pencil to you face too hard rather flick the pencil upward and outward at all times.Wipe of excess w/ spooly.</li>
    <li> The pencil feels dry, not as fresh as the ones I tried in the store, which is probably why it&#x27;s cheaper to buy it here.</li>
    <li> i bought the medium ash, very nice color and looks very natural, but very dry and difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how Anastasia does it but this pencil looks so natural on the brow.  AMAZING !  The vender service was also exceptional.</li>
    <li> Love it and would buy it again</li>
    <li> love the color and longevity of the product.  would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> I do really like this brow pencil and the color is perfect- they nailed the color for those brown haired girls who are going gray. It goes on nicely and looks convincing when filling in those brows.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve found! It stays on much longer than other ones Ive tried.</li>
    <li> My favorite brow filler. It stays all day and I love that the brush is on one end so its really conveniant.</li>
    <li> The color is great; the consistency is great!  After years of dealing with drug store brow liners, I decided to check out better quality pencils.  I am happy I chose this particular manufacturer.  I purchased the Anastasia Brow Wiz and the Perfect Brow pencils and I plan to stick with this manufacturer because the product is superior to anything I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Best pencil I have every owned!</li>
    <li> After searching for years, finally I found the perfect color - Medium Ash Perfect for light/fair skin and hair that used to be black and is now turning gray - the industry term is &amp;#34;salt and pepper&amp;#34;. Yes, it is expensive. Yes there are many other brow pencils from good companies. But they were just not right for me.  I even tried powder. It looked good on TV but not on me. The pencil is not too hard, not too soft and stays on all day. It does cost more but it lasts almost 6 months.  Update:  I have to admit that I tried other pencils again.  The reason is that my hair is getting lighter gray and there is no brown color in it. I tried NYX  charcoal brow pencil which is the right color... BUT the pencil encased in wood is too soft while the pencil in plastic gives only a little over 1 inch of product.  So, I went back to Anastasia but now I am using  Granite. It is not quite black. Just apply very light strokes.</li>
