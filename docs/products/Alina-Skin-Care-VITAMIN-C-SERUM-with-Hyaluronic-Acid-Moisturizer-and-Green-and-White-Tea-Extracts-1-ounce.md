<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff. I can notice a difference immediately after using it. It has completely made me feel comfortable going out without make up. The scent is a fresh orange aroma. The bottle is gorgeous, it&#x27;s such an easy Mother&#x27;s day gift. Total must buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week. I love Alina&#x27;s citris scent (not articifical smelling at all!). I love how Alina leaves my skin silky smooth like the feeling I get after a mask only with less time involved. Most of all, I love that after a few days of testing out Alina, the red areas of my face were less red. This serum truly does what it claims. A little goes a long way, so you&#x27;re getting your moneys worth. The bottle seemed small to me when I first unwrapped it, but after applying less than a pea size amount onto my whole face I realized it would take me a while to go through this! Upon unwrapping Alina for the first time, I was impressed by the packaging. The bottle is a frosted glass with a good pump. The graphic art is befitting for the scent. After using this for a week, I can confidently go without foundation on a regular outing. This doesn&#x27;t lay heavy on my face as my foundation would, so Alina is especially ideal for summer and working hard on the job.- Mrs. Weeks</li>
    <li> Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina Skin Care Enhanced Vitamin C Serum And Moisturizer by Alina Skin Care Inc. is a product that&#x27;s on my forever love list. It is for all skin types and has a light and citrusy scent. This serum is a cream that softens and moisturizes without any drying effects. It goes on smoothly and your skin will fell soft and look fantastic. After applying it to your face, neck and ack of hands it soaks right in to your skin without any greasy feeling. Your skin will glow and not feel dry. I love this product and it is now a familiar site in my bathroom. I gave this product 5 stars but wish I could give it more. I highly recommend this product to everyone especially those who want gorgeous skin. I look for more great products from Alina Skin Care In.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few vitamin C serums over the past year or so and have liked them all, but I especially like the Alina serum because of the added moisturizer. I have been using it in the morning and at night, and am very pleased with the look and feel of my skin. I have had no break-outs and my skin feels softer even without an additional moisturizer. The Alina product has a very light and pleasant fragrance that seems to go away as it is absorbed by the skin. I can feel a tingle on my eyelids as it soaks in, but it doesn&#x27;t sting. I have used most of the bottle in the course of a month, and my only complaint is that it is difficult to get more product out of the bottle once it gets down to about 20% of it left. I having been laying the bottle on its side and removing the lid/applicator the past several days, so I think I can get it all, but am disappointed that I have to work at it. So, no complaint about the product - I&#x27;m just a little bit dissatisfied with the bottle and applicator.</li>
    <li> As a 30-something, I am always searching for ways to keep my skin looking good and trying to prevent the aging process. I have a constant battle with my face (breakouts and dry patches mostly.) Finding good facial products can be a real challenge when you have acne-prone skin. I was offered a sample of this product to test and review and I was dubious; A lot of ingredients can clog my pores and make my skin flare up. None of the ingredients listed caused a red flag as being comedogenic (pore clogging), in fact vitamin C is known to be good for breakouts and to heal the scars caused by acne and hyaluronic acid Is used &amp;#34;for healing wounds, burns, skin ulcers, and as a moisturizer.&amp;#34; (Straight from web MD.) But all that is speculation unless it actually works for you. Before using this I had 5 or 6 healing blemishes in varying states of repair. The serum surprised me how it has made the marks fade in such little time and has not caused any new breakouts or clogged pores. It is not intended to be used instead of a moisturizer so I pat some hemp oil over the top after the serum has dried and absorbed in (hemp oil is both noncomedogenic and higher in lineolic acid which is why I use it for my acne-prone skin as a lot of acne is caused by a deficiency in linolic acid.) The serum smells like fresh citrus (Orange and grapefruit?). It leaves a slight tingle which for me lasts about 30 seconds and feels great. The formula absorbs quickly but doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dehydrated or dry tight like some serums do. It feels nourished. I am absolutely loving this stuff and I&#x27;m very picky about what I will put on my face. Once this runs out I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Almost out. Goes kinda fast. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely packaged, antioxidant rich facial serum that does a good job at priming your skin for secondary application of additional moisturizer product. The lotion has the expected degree of viscosity and a small dollop is all that is needed for coverage across the entirety of one&#x27;s face. Application to the skin is quick and smooth with no noticeable greasy, oily residual finish and because this is a dual product of serum and moisturizer you can leave your face as is or incorporate a further element of moisturization with the product of your choice. With the use of this serum and a separate moisturizer I&#x27;ve really come to appreciate the overnight results that I wake up to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is airy and pleasant with citrus notes at the forefront. The product also utilizes quality ingredients ranging from premium vitamin c ester and white/green tea extracts making this a great addition to your arsenal of skincare products (product sample provided for review).</li>
    <li> When I was invited to test Alina Vitamin C Serum, I was skeptical I&#x27;d be able to tolerate it. I&#x27;ve got aging, dry, sensitive skin, and generally don&#x27;t tolerate products containing any acids. My routine involves castile soap for cleaning and olive oil to moisturize. At 61, my skin, although not in terrible shape, is rougher than it used to be, more coarse, with noticeably larger pores, likely due to sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find that Alina&#x27;s Serum produced only a slight warming sensation on my eyelids the first couple of times I used it. This sensation has since dissipated, but not completely disappeared. Still, it&#x27;s never been uncomfortable, nor even mild tingling. The serum is silky, the consistency of cream. It dispenses and glides on easily, needing only 1 pump to provide enough product to cover my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has happened to my skin has been better than I could have hoped. In the last 2 weeks, it is smoother, softer and finer looking. It looks a little younger, with tighter pores. My wrinkles haven&#x27;t magically disappeared, but my skin looks noticeably better than it used to. As effective as it is, I think it&#x27;s very reasonably priced, especially compared to the big-name serums and treatments that don&#x27;t necessarily work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using my Alina Vitamin C Serum, keeping my skin softer than it&#x27;s been in a long, long time, while I wait for them to introduce my magic wrinkle treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample provided for review**</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had it long enough to really know yet. Seems to go on smooth. I like the texture.</li>
    <li> Love it! It leaves my skin moisturized all day and the color on my face has been much better. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! I&#x27;ve been using it consistently every morning and evening for a couple weeks now and I have already noticed a difference in my skin texture and even the tone. My skin seems smoother and softer and I love how refreshed it feels after I apply it. I would definitely recommend this product to people!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have been using it morning and night for two weeks now and I already see a difference in my skin. My make-up stays on better, my skin is less oily and has a radiance about it that wasn&#x27;t there before. I&#x27;m a forty-ish mom of three and have little time (or extra money) for a complicated skin care regimen. This is simple to use, affordable and actually WORKS - good luck finding that combination at the drug store or mall. I have definitely found my new go-to product. A small amount under my moisturizer/sunscreen and I&#x27;m ready to face the day with bright, smooth, pretty skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see what else this company develops!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing serum. Used it to moisture my skin before applying make up.</li>
    <li> This is the highest level quality Vitamin C Serum I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve been using this on my skin two times a day for about 2 weeks now and plan on continuing to use it! Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the size. The bottle is the perfect size for travel in the right-size carry-on travel bag as well as a throw in your purse if you&#x27;ll need to reapply during the day. It is a lovely container and the pump works perfectly. It gives you just enough for one single application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the smell. I love the smell. It&#x27;s a mild but pleasant smell that I sniff up as I apply. It just makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the texture. Most Vitamin C Serums are lucid / clear and also void of any moisture. Alina hits the right balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin, which (raising hand!) I&#x27;m one to possess. I have to be so careful what to put on my face and I haven&#x27;t had a bit of reaction to this beautiful lovely serum. My skin loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the price. The serums out there are so expensive that for a while, I was just putting lemon or tomato on my face (which also works brilliantly in a pinch) but Alina is quite reasonable. Happy about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it&#x27;s made in the USA. Bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you decide if this is the right Vitamin C Serum for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a complimentary sample of the product and this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been using for over a month and have noticed my skin looking brighter, feeling softer and less dry. Creamy, non-greasy lotion that has a refreshing scent. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> So i was looking forward to get this product - because it sounded like it would solve the problem of just applying vitamin c serum - i have been trying many different vitamin c serum and even though i found great product - the problem with dryness remained. This product sounded like it would solve that problem and its reviews looked great. BUT you have to be careful - i guess everyone&#x27;s skin is not the same. As soon as I applied this on my face it started feeling itch and showed redness... I was really sad that i tried really small amount thinking that my skin maybe need a little bit of time to get used to it but again it is not working on my skin. I am thinking - I have been using almost only organic products for my face and maybe thats why. I guess if you are using organic products you have to go with them forever... but anyways i am just posting this sot hat nobody experiences something like this as I did!</li>
    <li> I gave myself two weeks of using this product before I decided to review. Even though it does actually take over 30 days for you see any &#x27;real&#x27; results with these types of products, i was BLOWN AWAY on my first application.&lt;br /&gt;OH EM GEE, my face has NEVER felt this good....and the smell, just scrumptious I tell ya!&lt;br /&gt;Application is smooth and easy. No mess, no bother. That&#x27;s what I like. I hate products that are high maintenance. More than one step and I already don&#x27;t have time! LOL THIS product hit the mark! And I have to say, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s wishful thinking or what, but I could swear the skin around my eyes is WAY smoother than when I began ... ALREADY!&lt;br /&gt;I am SO in love with this product I cannot wait to shop further from Alina Skin Care, Inc!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing me this wonderful product for testing and reviewing! It has tuned me into a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> * I received a review unit of this product in order to write a review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by third party members in any way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this lotion for the past week and so far I am very pleased with it. The ingredients are of high quality and definitely shows with the products high price point and effectiveness. The aroma is really strong and smells like orange so if you are not fond of the the smell of orange be warned. The casing of the product works well with the twist lock mechanism and squirts out smoothly. Application is easy and smooths out well into the skin. It leaves your skin feeling great with no oily residue and definitely does not clog up pimples for me which is an area that I was problems with. Overall this is a great serum that works well with one&#x27;s skin. If you have the money to dish out a few extra dollars and enjoy the smell of orange, then definitely check out this product. Another plus is that the product is made in the USA so it feels good to support a US brand.</li>
    <li> got this product to review and i gave to my mother and she loves it so far!</li>
    <li> I love the way it has softened my skin, but I can&#x27;t see any difference in the wrinkles.  Still, it&#x27;s a pleasure to apply, smells wonderful, and feels great on my skin.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;m glad I bought it this time.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for it to make a difference on the wrinkles.  I think I read one time that it takes at least six months.  I&#x27;ve only been using the cream for about four-five weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I finally found one serum which is really effective for my skin! Wow! Best Vitamin C Serum I have tried so far. Alina serum smells great and I love to take it every day! Last year I tested a lot of different Vitamin C serums but none was as good as this one! The quality is absolutely great! It not only smells good but also feels good because it is not too thick and easy to use! My skin feels really refreshed and revitalized!&lt;br /&gt;Try it out! It works!</li>
    <li> I really love the texture of this product, I like how it makes my skin feel, It has a very nice, not greasy or sticky texture, I will continue using this product and most likely purchase it again. I would rate this product an 8/10.</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews and it drives me to give a  try to buy this product, so far my wife loves it! Great skin care products.</li>
    <li> Really like this cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and really feel it has made a difference to my skin</li>
    <li> I love this product, and what it has done for my skin. I am 25 years old, with combination skin, and I decided to start adding Vitamin C to my skin care/anti-aging regime. This has made a great difference. I started noticing dry patches, and uneven skintone along the sides of my chin around my mouth within the past two years. No amount of hydration could fix it! I finally turned to Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid, and it transformed my skin. It feels nice to know that with all the time and effort I put into my skin I am not only treating, I am preventing.  The only downside to this product is that the pump broke within only 2 weeks!!!! I have to unscrew the top and shake the product out onto the top of my hand. This results in ultimately not being able to reach all of the product &#x3D; waste of money. I like the bottle, it&#x27;s a strong glass, and feels smooth in my hand, but the cheap faulty pump has to go!</li>
    <li> Product does moisturizer and smooth skin</li>
    <li> This pleasant, citrus-scented lotion spreads easily over skin and is fully absorbed not too much later.  It leaves my skin feeling instantly supple without feeling greasy or oily.  The directions say to use this under a moisturizer; however, I often use it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most cosmetics labeled as serums are clear, thin liquids.  Not so with this Alina skin care serum.  It is a white lotion with more body than most serums.  You won&#x27;t lose any of this between your fingers.  Despite this, it still spreads freely:  one pump full covers my entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try so much beauty products, including other brands of hyaluronic acid serums, moiturizers, and retinol formulations that it&#x27;s impossible for me to say how well this works to reduce aging, especially after only a couple of weeks of use.  I will say, however, that it does not irritate my sensitive skin and that I do like the way my skin feels and looks after using this product.  It has become a part of my facial routine.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> It is a great product! It works as promised.</li>
    <li> This serum is thick and it only takes a very small amount to smooth under the eyes and on the areas of skin on the face where you need it. It has a pleasant, non-greasy feel. The scent is light and unoffensive. I feel a small amount of smoothing or tightening under my eyes when I use it. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in coloration or overall smoothing though. Even so, I would keep using this just for under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This has a lovely, fresh citrus type scent. It goes on smoothly and dries to a silky matte finish, so it works very well under makeup, so smooth and non-greasy. I use this in conjunction with Youyaner Derma Roller as my deep moisturizer, it feels so great and my skin looks A-MA-ZING!!!  The manufacturer sent me a sample of this to try and now I&#x27;m hooked, LOVE this stuff. Great for sensitive skin too, I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
    <li> I love this face serum. The packaging is very luxurious and very high quality. You can definitely reuse this bottle after it is empty. The serum feels very nice too on my skin. It has a very light scent but if you are sensitive to fragrance it shouldn&#x27;t bother your skin. In general I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts or negative reaction from using this serum. I like to use this after cleansing and toning my face at night. It sinks in very quickly but leaves your skin feeling hydrated. I definitely notice that it makes my skin look brighter and more hydrated. It also makes my skin feel smoother texture-wise. I really like that the formula is completely all natural and it is not tested on animals. I think this is a great all around skin serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this for review but all opinions, observations, and experiences are my own.</li>
    <li> Being not a metrosexual, I don&#x27;t buy/use cosmetic lotion. Not only do I not even think about it, I just simply don&#x27;t like that sticky sensation of lotions and creams on my skin. But I was sent this serum for review, so I tried it out just for that sake. And I must say this serum doesn&#x27;t bother me as much - it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue or feeling. As a guy, I really don&#x27;t know if these types of cosmetic creams even truly work, but after application, I can feel the potency of this vitamin c concoction on my skin, like you can feel it working. The smell is lovely, like an orange-flavored yogurt/Jamba Juice smoothie. I really don&#x27;t know how much these types of things are worth, but hey, if it&#x27;s too cheap, would you trust that on your skin? So give this a try - coming from a guy who hates lotions and creams but actually liked using this one - you will like this too.</li>
    <li> Burned my skin as soon as l put it on, now I have a red face with little bumps all over.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this serum, for free, for&lt;br /&gt;testing purposes....&lt;br /&gt;Please know that had no influence over&lt;br /&gt;my opinions.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 35 year, with normal to combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;This serum worked well as a before make up&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer, for me....&lt;br /&gt;It is in a sturdy glass container, with a pump...&lt;br /&gt;Every knows how important VitaminC supplements&lt;br /&gt;are, they just don&#x27;t realize, you need them from the&lt;br /&gt;inside out.... You should be using products like this&lt;br /&gt;to give your skin resilience.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the way this serum, actually smelled&lt;br /&gt;citrusy! Not many I have tried have a citrusy scent...&lt;br /&gt;It is a lovely, fresh scent...&lt;br /&gt;I also liked how well it moisturized, and got my face&lt;br /&gt;ready to apply make up...&lt;br /&gt;This serum comes in a lotion form... A medium to thick. consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying as your facial moisturizer...</li>
    <li> This product is very nice. It was not greasy, I put it on directly before I went to bed and it smells like orange oil! It&#x27;s really smooth and feels like a really nice lotion instead of a night cream. I noticed that my under eye area was less puffy after two days of use. I will continue to use this product! Although I recieved this product at a free or dicounted rate, it does not change my opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> Great Vitamin C serum! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite serum!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Alina Vitamin C Serum for several weeks now and I love it!  I am a fair completed senior gal with some sun damage and some mild rosacea and I do have sensitive skin so I am very careful what products I use or try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say the Alina Vitamin C Serum has improved the skin texture on my face as well as on the back of my hands as I also use it every night on my hands, wrists and forearms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to so many products and I absolutely LOVE the smell of the Alina Vitamin C Serum.  LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product I have used in this line and it was sent to me to use and review and I must say it won&#x27;t be the last product I will try and I do intend to purchase the Vitamin C Serum when I need to because I truly like the results I am seeing! I should also say that it just &#x27;morphs&#x27; into my skin with no greasy after feeling.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because I bought it for my wife and she ended up loving it. I dont use it myself but if she loves it, I love it. She says it makes her skin &amp;#34;feel better&amp;#34; (not sure what that means) and said she can feel a little tightness. If she it still happy with it when she finishes it then I will buy her more. Seller ships quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, I love the way it makes youR face tingle just a little bit, it works wonderful I would definitely recommend this to other family and friends.</li>
    <li> Im very careful of what im applying in my face as my skin is very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I got this for testing in review purposes so i give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;So far there is no any side effects and itchiness.One thing i dont like is the smell as i am also sensitive in scents.The scents is not stronger its just light but its me and i just dont like it ,but its also just manageable for me what i did is after applying the moisturizer i covered some baby powder or blush on, it adds bloom to face.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it as its not sticky or making my face oily after long periods staying outdoor unlike the other moisturizer that i got from local store.&lt;br /&gt;After usage i can feel that it really works and absorb in the skin,improve my dry skin into soft and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I was unsure of this product at first.  I thought it was a nice moisturizer but didn&#x27;t notice much difference right away.  I am now almost done with the bottle and I have to say I definitely think it has brightened my skin and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this product that&#x27;s helping with my breakouts or the fish oil and hair/skin/nails vitamins I started taking but something is working. I stopped using it for about a week and noticed a difference in that short time so I&#x27;m back to using it regularly and ready to order a second bottle now.  My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; if I had one would be the product that remains at the bottle of the bottle that the tube can&#x27;t get out.  I&#x27;ve just been using a Q-tip to get it out so as not to waste any.</li>
    <li> First off the order came quick. Received it on time. Its been my 4th day of using it and i feel no more oiliness on my face. I feel its softer now. I like it. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Smells great! Evened my skin tone! I have no acne now! I am being told I look radiant! And I even see some improvement in my wrinkles. I am not normally a believer in things like this... I am usually a huge skeptic, but this definitely works!  Update: I have been using this product for 3 weeks now... I cannot count how many people have told me that I am glowing and look radiant! People keep asking me if I am in love! HAHA! But really, this product has definitely improved my skin!  Update: I have been using this product for 4 months now... My acne is minimal at best... And I have really bad underlying skin... It makes my skin literally glow... It is amazing! I HIGHLY recommend this! My skin is noticeably way better! I can literally not wear makeup because of this product! I know a lot of people get sent a product and for a review... I found this on my own... I bought it with my own money... I absolutely LOVE it and what it has done for my skin! I have reordered and will continue to do so! This has proven itself daily!</li>
    <li> I am greatly enjoying this Vitamin C Serum from Alina Skin Care.  It impressed me from the very first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the orange fragrance--not too strong and it diminishes with time.  But it is the initial whiffs of orange that are very uplifting as it is applied to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a consistency that is easy to spread on the face, and it absorbs so quickly into the skin, too.  It is immediately apparent that there are soothing moisturizers in the mix.  And, so far, the moisturizers have not clogged my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other Vitamin C Serums before:  Some are thick and almost syrupy and I don&#x27;t like the feeling that the serum is sitting on top of my face.  Others contain a bit too much acid in them, and while the initial few applications make my skin feel nice and tingly, eventually my skin becomes too dry.  This Alina is just right for me!  It soaks right into my skin and causes a slight warming effect.  It seems a perfect balance of components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Alina Skin Care.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the positive reviews. Smells nice, does nothing.</li>
    <li> it was returned, the pump on the bottle was broken</li>
    <li> One of the most amazing parts of this serum is that it is full of natural ingredients that work deep into your skin for amazing benefits. I am unlike the standard users who would typically buy a Vitamin C Serum, being an early 20&#x27;s male, so my skin is already fairly young - yet this serum still managed to have my skin feel a hundred times healthier. I do have oily skin and was concerned a moisturizer may make it even worse, but ultimately did not notice any change or issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This two in one Vitamin C Serum with moisturizing properties is filled with amazing moisturizer ingredients (Organic Aloe Vera, to name one of the best) that keep your skin hydrated. Their special Inflacin ingredient helps to soothe and calm the skin, keeping it from being irritated and inflamed for a variety of reasons. I have used this serum when I had major sunburn and the results were ultimately amazing - I have yet to have any product come close to the amazing feel of this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of serums on the market have difficulty getting the consistency and texture right, usually resembling Goldilocks with being either too thick or too runny - yet this serum has managed to have an amazingly silky feeling that spreads like silk on the skin. When I first started using this serum, I was thrilled to find that there were only great benefits and just as important, that it had a great refreshing smell. One of the most surprising things of this purchase was having results of even better skin almost instantly; within two to three days I could visibly see improved skin overall, as well as the instant relief on areas that had gotten sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would undoubtedly recommend this product regardless of the health of your skin; my skin is already young and healthy, but I was still able to use this product for amazing benefits. I have had this product for one week now, and can only imagine how my skin will be a month or months down the line.

    <li> This is without a doubt the best Vitamin C Serum moisturizer I have ever used. My husband works for a skincare manufacturing company and I have tried hundreds of products over the years and I can say that this item is truly the best.</li>
    <li> The serum enhances skin glow and makes my face look brighter. It satisfies my needs and it stays good at any outside temperature. The skin texture is soft and the serum is packed in a compact way. It serves for a longer period and I feel getting it once the bottle gets over.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I liked the price - to me it seems just as good as one that cost me $100. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> it felt good going on, made my skin feel soft all day, I have reordered, wish it came in larger supply, because using it twice a day doesn&#x27;t even last a month</li>
    <li> Alina skin care vitamin serum is suites for all type of skin,your skin will look young, i a, using this already and i can feel the chnges that brough on my skin.A BETTER VITAMIN C. Some forms of vitamin c require higher concentration levels in order to be effective because they are inherently less stable and don&#x27;t penetrate the skin as well as other forms. Unfortunately, products that contain higher concentration levels of vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate is an example) can also increase the risk of skin irritation. Alina Vitamin C Serum uses a premium vitamin c ester which has been clinically proven to be gentler on the skin while delivering superior results over traditional ascorbic acid and phosphate based vitamin c.i got this for frew in exchnge to my unbiased and honey review.</li>
    <li> Good for summer. Light and smooth. It&#x27;s not good for dry skin. Not moisturizing enough for super dry</li>
    <li> Still early days but I certainly can feel and see the difference even after 01 day</li>
    <li> Ive used this Vitamin C serum for a couple months and I love it! Im not one to wear a lot of make up or use a ton of skin care stuff.. But I really believe this product does a lot for my skin! I&#x27;ve seen such a difference in my time since using it. I really like the way it smells and how good it&#x27;s feels when I apply it, also that it&#x27;s not greasy and dosnt leave my skin dry. Such a good Product! So glad my friend introduced me to it.</li>
    <li> REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we get older, our skin has a tendency to lose it&#x27;s elasticity and starts to get those little wrinkles.  It also loses it&#x27;s moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C Serum doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feeling as some lotions and creams do.  It doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling either.  The serum has a wonderful, clean smell.  It has just a hint of Citrus but not overwhelming.  Another wonderful thing about this particular serum  is the price.  Most Serums are in little bottles with a bit price tag on them.  Not  Alina,  The bottle is a good size with a price to match. The serum doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.  My face is very sensitive and gets irritated easily.  The Alina Serum is very gentle and after putting it on it feels so soothing. I also have a tendency for break outs on my face.  This serum helps to clear it up and keep it clear. A nice thing about this product is it isn&#x27;t tested on animals. I would recommend this product to anyone.  It has so many great plus factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary sample of ALINA SKIN CARE ENHANCED VITAMIN SERUM from Alina Skin Care, Inc for my view of the product.</li>
    <li> This serum made a difference to my facial skin.  I noticed my skin was shinier, not greasy.  The serum is like a very light cream, it goes on very smooth.  Becareful with how much comes out, as a lot tends to come out.  I also travel with it, and notice that it&#x27;s quite thick, and sometimes the cream is around the tube, not under it, so I can&#x27;t pump anything out... easy fix though.  I can just unscrew it and move it around a little.  Believe me, I will waste nothing.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to really help my eye area though, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.  It also has a delicious citrus smell.  It seems to absorb fairly well, not a long time before I put on my moisturizer.  I bought two bottles.  This will be my serum for a long time.  I&#x27;ll put it this way, I&#x27;ve been looking for a new eye cream, but have not been researching anymore vitamin C facial serums.  I use it after my morning shower, and at night after I cleanse my face.</li>
    <li> This is the most expensive and worst Vitamin C serum I have ever used.  Very disappointed to know that most of the positive reviews were &amp;#34;sponsored&amp;#34; or the result of free gifts from the company.  Disappointing practice and product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also an MSRP of $90?</li>
    <li> I got this for the review have used it now for a few day and my skin has improved everyday</li>
    <li> This is truly a unique Vitamin C serum that I received to test and review. It is not clear like other Vitamin C serums I have used. Instead, it looks and feels more like a moisturizing lotion. It is a unique combination of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Serum.  After applying the serum, a wonderful citrus fragrance is released and I felt a slight warming and tingling feel for about 20 minutes. It&#x27;s almost as if the serum awakens my skin, leaving my complexion glowing and my skin feeling refreshed. The directions state to use then apply a moisturizer, but this alone leaves my skin feeling soft.    Alina&#x27;s serum is definitely on my 5-star list, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what else they come out with because I feel this product stands out differently from the rest.</li>
    <li> I got it as a test product. I have been using different vitamin for 2 years. I am 90% happy with this product for three reasons. First, its texture is thin and it easily absorbs. Second, the serum does not have strong smell as the products i got before which i really like. Third, the price is alright. I will not spend hundreds on the skin care. However, the top does not work so well, this is the only place i am not happy with.</li>
    <li> Just after the first use, I thought I had found a wonderful product, because I noticed that my skin felt very soft.  Plus the lotion smells wonderful - like fresh orange peel.  Unfortunately, after a couple weeks of use, I my face started to break out in places I usually never have blemishes.</li>
    <li> Literally the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used. I patch-tested it first on my hand before putting it on my face and that was fine. The instant I put it on my face it started burning like crazy. Although I washed it off immediately, I couldn&#x27;t use ANY kind of face product for a couple days because it would burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID! Would give negative stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product. I love the smell of it and how it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling afterward. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my face since I&#x27;ve used it but i still like it. The shipping was very fast and i had no problems</li>
    <li> I love this product. Wonderful aroma fades the dark spots goes on smoothly and is a joy to use.</li>
    <li> No issues with the seller at all.  The product itself is a tad silly as they added some kind of citrus fragrance, I guess so consumers would buy into the vitamin &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; part, like thinking, &amp;#34;oh, this must be strong&amp;#34; or something like that.  I&#x27;ve use other products that were more effective at right about the same price.</li>
    <li> Shipper shipped fast great price! The product is awesome! It smells so good when it goes on your skin. Orange blossom mmm</li>
    <li> My skin did not react well to this serum. My face turned red after I applied this. Did not see any results.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is easy to apply, not too thin, not sticky, smells nice, and it is affordable. I noticed a difference in my skin after a few weeks. My pores look smaller and my skin seems softer.  I&#x27;m sure it took a while for a difference to show, because I have been using other brands of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid serums that were doing something, but this is better. Finally!  Something I can order and not wonder if there is something better for me!</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I APPLY IT BOTH MORNING AND NIGHT UNDER MY MOISTURIZER.  IT ABSORBS QUICKLY AND IS NOT GREASY.  MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES ARE FADING.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO IS CONCERNED WITH AGING SKIN.</li>
    <li> I am loving it! So far the best skin care cream...after using it for a week I&#x27;ve seen amazing results, my skin is looking healthy, young and glowing...definitely minimizes my fine lines and moisturizes...will be ordering one again and absolutely would recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I was asked to do a review on this vitamin C serum! I have been trying out different vitamin C serum’s over the past few months, so I could find the one I loved the most for my skin. I have finally found it! Look no further because this is some of the best that you will find, and at a great rate as well!&lt;br /&gt;This serum smells amazing!! This isn’t too thick or too liquidity, so it makes it easy to rub on and it absorbs instantly. I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be careful what I used because it will make me break out in rashes and my skin itches like crazy. My skin has had no problems at all to this serum. I even let me co-worker use a little bit of it, and she has even more sensitive skin than I do, and she didn’t have any irritation either! (I think I have convinced her to purchase some of this on her own because she loves it so much!)&lt;br /&gt;I have read that this helps with hormonal breakouts as well. I cannot attest to this right now, but I’m looking forward to trying it out. I tend to get lots of breakouts, but haven’t seen any in a while. I am not stating that this has helped clear my breakouts, it could just be a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, I feel very refreshed and ready to take on the world. I do love this product and recommend it to anyone wanting to try it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about skin care products and approached this one without great expectations.  Seems there&#x27;s only so much that can be accomplished with creams or lotions, and aging skin is a fact of life.  I&#x27;m 63 years old, and actually have very few wrinkles.  But it would be SO nice to find something to improve the elasticity of my skin.  After using this serum for two weeks, I have to say that I do see improvement!  Under eye wrinkles are barely noticeable, and slight wrinkles on the sides of my mouth have plumped up.  Regarding skin firmness, if there&#x27;s improvement it&#x27;s slight at this point; however, I&#x27;ll persist.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product and I&#x27;m about to order it again!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this after the stellar reviews. The reality is that it&#x27;s so thick, the bottle was gone in three weeks. At that time I saw no results. Will not be reordering.</li>
    <li> seems to help with sagging jawline</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and it does what it says it will do. I would recommend this to anyone out there. I purchased this product in order to leave a review and was not expecting much but they did exceed my expectations. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and I like the lightness of it. I use every morning and night. I can&#x27;t say I have seen any difference though and I have very little left and probably should see some results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this a day and I&#x27;ve tried it twice so far.  I love the way it makes my skin feel fresh, smooth and &#x27;tingly&#x27;.  It goes on very nice and rubs in without a trace of oiliness or anything left behind but leaving your skin feeling smooth.  Will see if it helps the darkness under my eyes after a while!! Will update then or if I would happen to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this to review, but all opinions are 100% my own!</li>
    <li> We have just received the Vitamin C Serum.  The product came excellently protected, and sealed.&lt;br /&gt;The Alina serum glides on smoothly, and is not  too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased the serum in a promotion for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;We have been using Vitamin C Serum for several years, with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;This particular brand is nice, premium quality, has Vitamin C with Organic Aloe and Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very smooth going on and a few drops go a long way, so the bottle will last a good while.</li>
    <li> the only vitamin c serum my skin nees in order to flourish.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C Serum I have tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;In the past year, I have tried probably about 20 Vitamin C serums and while some of them were pretty decent, none were as effective and as absolutely gorgeously smelling as the Alina one. I was really blown away by the quality of this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on silky smooth, it&#x27;s not too thick nor too liquidy, it smells divine and it actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for over 10 days now, as I always evaluate all skin care products for about 7-10 days before sharing my opinion, and honestly, I have no plans of switching to anything else. My skin feels replenished, revitalized, refreshed and just all around rejuvenated. I&#x27;ve been applying it heavily to my under-eye areas to see if it will help minimize the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and gosh, I really think it did. Significantly! I am beyond thrilled to have discovered this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this one of the most effective vitamin C serums out there, it&#x27;s also the best smelling one I have ever used. Some vitamin C serums smell merely tolerable, most smell like something that died in your grandmas medicine cabinet, this one? It smells like freshly peeled citrus. Ever used the Grapefruit face scrub from YES TO? This serum smells exactly like that. It&#x27;s such a fresh, energizing smell, I can&#x27;t get enough of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see more products from this brand - I will definitely be purchasing more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of the product for evaluation purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> It helps reducing fine lines under eyes. I will purchase again. Thanks Alina</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  It goes on so well, and leaves my face feeling soft.  The mild tingling after applied just lets me know it&#x27;s going to work on my skin, and I can honestly see a difference on my face.  I will definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product is how easily it spreads and how quickly it absorbs. So many other skin care products are so sticky and thick they don&#x27;t really spread well. I don&#x27;t normally use any skin care products and rarely even apply sun-block. However,I found Alina kept my skin feeling soft and moist -- even when in and out of the sun during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed is that this product helps reduce the appearance of puffiness when dabbed around the eyes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see signs of anti-aging, but it seems more people are inclined to tell me I&#x27;m &amp;#34;looking&#x27; good.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s nice to hear that and maybe it&#x27;s a hint that the youthful promise on the label might be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many other reviews and the product description itself cover details I won&#x27;t repeat here, but one thing I did not notice being mentioned was the reduction of the dark appearance of &amp;#34;age spots.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product. It feels nice on your skin, smells amazing and even made my skin look brighter. However, it made me breakout horribly :(  I think it&#x27;s worth a try though. Obviously not everyone will have the same reaction. If not for the breakouts, I would be in love with this serum.</li>
    <li> I like the product but feel that it is hard to give it a fair rating at this point. I am not sure if the pump is defective for 2 reasons. Each time a different amount comes out. Too little or too much.  Although I am careful about not pressing too hard, I feel that I have used up more in a shorter time than I believe is expected and so the results may not be optimum AND the pump stopped working with about 1/4 of the product still in the bottle. Yes I can shake some into my palm but for the price feel that it has not met its praise.</li>
    <li> I just got my Vitamin C Serum yesterday and cannot wait to start seeing the results that others have reviewed about!  I have used it twice (last night and this morning) and so far have liked the way the product feels on my skin and smells.  I&#x27;m very particular on how products smell, because if you are using them that close to your nose then they should smell nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller and excellent merchandise and fast shipping strongly recommend  it Thank you .</li>
    <li> This serum is white and viscous like a lotion and has a very pleasant and natural sweet citrus fragrance. It is very soothing when applied to the skin and is quickly absorbed, leaving it smooth and soft but not greasy. The serum does not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains several ingredients that improve the appearance of the skin by increasing hydration, reducing the effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells. For instance, there are many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months. Regular application over a period of many weeks or months is necessary to see the promised benefits--it is not an instant cure for damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is frosted glass with a high quality pump for easy dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Purified water, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, cyclomethicone, caprylic/capric triglyceride, diisopropyl adipate, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate, Camellia oleifera (green tea) leaf extract, Camellia sinensis (white tea) leaf extract, Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf extract, tocopherol acetate, pyridoxine HCl, niacinamide, calcium pantothenate, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, PEG-23 glyceryl distearate, PEG-12 glyceryl dimyristate, hyaluronic acid, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, sodium starch octenylsuccinate, glycerin, PEG-100 stearate, Citrus nobilis (mandarin orange) peel oil, Citrus grandis (grapefruit) peel oil, maltodextrin, xanthan gum, silica, disodium EDTA, ethylhexylglycerin, hexylene glycol, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina provided a bottle for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I love the current trend of combining several &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; ingredients into one skin product.  Alina Skin Care has a winner in this one.  It&#x27;s Vitamin C and hyurolonic acid, plus some other goodies in one bottle.  It&#x27;s a serum, yet it&#x27;s very thick and creamy.  It moisturizes all by itself, which many serum products don&#x27;t.  It makes skin look good immediately.  Continued use will make it look amazing I have no doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle claims it&#x27;s for all skin types.  I can attest that it looks and feels equally wonderful on both the dry and oily areas of my face.  Time will tell how it performs on fine lines and wrinkles, but they&#x27;re less noticeable after applying this product; no doubt there&#x27;s a light diffusing element in it, which is fine by me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has an intense but very pleasant grapefruit fragrance that quickly dissipates.  It&#x27;s also made in the USA.  At the current price, it&#x27;s a bargain;  I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for products that weren&#x27;t nearly as luxurious or effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
    <li> Did nothing to my skin.. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Great! I can feel the vitamin C working.  Plus, I have very sensitive, dry skin and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts from it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I used this for at least 30 days before writing a review. I saw results within 2 weeks, and have continued seeing results, and I am loving it. My skin has NEVER looked as vibrant and beautiful as it does now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a 27 year old mother of 3 under 2 years old, has aged me terribly, my skin is smoother and more even than it was in college! I have had many friends and family members tell me how great my skin looks and have said I look &amp;#34;less tired&amp;#34; (I wish).  My only issue with this cream is that I was really hoping it would reduce the bags under my eyes, unfortunately the lack of sleep and chasing around a toddler and two babies is more powerful than any face cream!&lt;br /&gt; Either way, this is a great product and I highly recommend it. I wish I had taken before and after pictures, I am sure I would be amazed at the difference!</li>
    <li> Its not too greasy not too thick easy to absorb and lightweight what i also like is the container its easy to use than what i bought before. I like it i just use it twice so im still looking forward for a great result :)</li>
    <li> I came across this product after it was recommended I look into using Vitamin C moisturizer on my face. It had great reviews and I can see why. This product is light, refreshing and makes your skin feel very smooth. And it has a very clean and refreshing scent to it. My skin looks and feels so much smoother and brighter. The only drawback is that you get such a small bottle for the price. Even though I use a small amount in the morning and at bedtime, I have about 1/4 of the bottle left and I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month now.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest- I signed up for this product as some promotional deal from the company to review the product.  I thought I was going to get some trial sample of it and then try to come up with a bunch of great things to say about a product I didn&#x27;t really enjoy, I&#x27;m just a skeptic about products that promise these huge results or seem too good to be true.  I&#x27;ve experimented with Vitamin C lotions and serums off and on since I was pregnant, and everything is either too greasy or seems to be scented water and the one other product I found that seemed to work smelled like chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in a large city in the desert my skin is an issue. Between the sand, the winds, the heat, and chemicals from pollution and everyone&#x27;s carbon footprint my skin can be a mess. I wanted to start using the serum to help but I was worried it would dry my skin out worse because of the heat and the research I did said it&#x27;s a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have that result with this. My skin stayed smooth and soft, the smell wasn&#x27;t offensive at all, and I feel like the irritations and sun blotches are really reacting to the product. It wasn&#x27;t instant, like everything else I guess it took a little time to work, but the difference is amazing.  AND my skin stayed soft, did I mention that?  Because in the desert heat and sun that is almost impossible when you use ANY product on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;It works miracles but it&#x27;s not a miracle, so give it time to work.&lt;br /&gt;Apply at night before bed or when you are hanging out at home for a while, don&#x27;t put it on before you go into the sun.</li>
    <li> This serum has all the ingredients I like. It has tea extract, aloe, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin c. My skin usually loves products with these things in it. I must confess that love the smooth creamy rich consistency. I honestly don&#x27;t use it like a serum. It feels so moisturizing that I use it like a moisterizer over another (different) vitamin c serum. My skin looks so radiant and smooth.  This products absorbs well and plays well with other products. This is hands down my favorite serum at the moment.</li>
    <li> This seems like a quality product. I have not used it long enough to tell if it makes a difference in my skin.  It has a nice smell, kind of smells like citrus and it does not leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I  love this serum. it&#x27;s light and smells fresh. I&#x27;ve used other vitamin serums and this isn&#x27;t as harsh on my face. it&#x27;s small but lasts awhile. one small pump is good for me. it&#x27;s helped with dark spots I got from pregnancy and I use it on the back on my hand.</li>
    <li> This product is made in America and smells great. It has a citrus smell, mostly a sweet orange smell. The lotion is very soft and silky. It goes on very smooth and soaks in immediately. It also has no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using this product for several months now, and I&#x27;ve noticed how much this has helped. It doesn&#x27;t take long to start seeing results. It really does what it claims. It is a great product too. It’s a good idea to keep it refrigerated. This will keep the serum from oxidizing too quickly, and will give you a better result for the price. Below is how my wife uses hers, I think she read this online somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correct method of application will definitely increase the effectiveness of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Dampen your face with water and start by applying the serum to your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Let it dry for some time and then apply a moisturizer, if possible use one with a sunscreen in it. It is important that you use the serum before moisturizing and not after. This is because the serum is easily absorbed into the skin, while moisturizers work on the surface. If you use the moisturizer first, your skin will not be able to absorb the vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money you cannot beat the results. The claims of a facelift in a bottle are actually true. Alina Skin Care Inc supplied a sample to evaluate, test and review.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband (man of color) has been using it and he loves this.&lt;br /&gt;He uses it every 2 to 3 days. He uses this after he shaves his skin feels more supple.&lt;br /&gt;It has improved his skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;He has seen results within 36 hours.&lt;br /&gt;He would buy this in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for him. I have not tried it yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week, in the morning and at night, and already I have noticed a difference in my skin. I have some dark marks from acne and they are already lightening up after one week of use. My skin also seems to be more even and has a glow, not to mention the serum smells good as well! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been trying all sorts of serums and face creams over the past year and this one is far better than any I&#x27;ve tried! I wish there were more products from this company. It&#x27;s like a mystery. Until then, I will faithfully use it. My skin is smoother, tighter, and plumper, and when I wake up in the morning it looks glowy.  I frequently get asked on what I&#x27;m using to make my skin look the way it does, well here it is folks!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C serum smells really nice and spreads very well on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It gets absorbed very fast and leaves my skin hydrated and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;One biggest thing I noticed since I started using it is that my skin LOOKS A LOT HEALTHIER!!!&lt;br /&gt;By healthier I mean my skin color becomes brighter, my skin tone is more even now, my acne has reduced a lot(i am also using the dudu osun african black soap. that helps with acne too), and even if i had acne, they recovered much faster now, which reduce the chance of scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all over my face day and night, even around my eyes. It gives sting around my eye area but it&#x27;s not a big deal since it will disappear after 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this serum. I am using my second bottle now. It&#x27;s still working great!!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It effectively hydrates my dry skin, so it&#x27;s really a huge help to my flaking problem. It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> A great product. I love how it goes on easily and so smooth it feels like velvet. No greasy film. It makes my skin look healthier and plump instead of dry. There is no smell at all to this product and applying 5 to 7 drops to face twice a day is all you need. This is a beauty product that. I will be keeping around and glad. I got these on a protmotional offer so I could provide my honest feedback on these</li>
    <li> Very nice cream, not greasy, with a wonderful smell</li>
    <li> This serum meets my expectation in maintaining my skin texture. After this serum being used, my skin looks glowing and feels soft. It highly meets my skin needs and thereby enhances my face look.</li>
    <li> I have used vitamin c serum for several years and it is a huge help. This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail. I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Alina Skincare Vitamin C Serum. I have very sensitive skin and this product feels so amazing on your face. I love the smell, it actually has an orange citrus smell. I actually look forward to putting it on. It feels great under my makeup and I put it on again at night. I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of a change in the way my skin appears, it has more of a glow. It&#x27;s well worth the price and I will definitely purchase another bottle after this one is gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Vitamin C serum before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, but I love the way this stuff goes on. It only takes a tiny bit to spread really far, but it&#x27;s not too sticky or greasy. And it smells very fresh and good- a bit like grapefruit. Definitely like it.</li>
    <li> Works great! A little dab goes a long way! This has become part of my daily routine!</li>
    <li> I really like this Alina Vitamin C Serum and use it daily.  I have noticed an improvement in my skin and a reduction in my facial lines.</li>
    <li> I was sent this to review for Alina. The product ships in a really nice package, arrived extremely fast and was in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;My wife gave it a try for a couple days. It puts a noticable shine on the face and makes the face look &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;, however, it caused irritation with her skin and she had to quit using it. It caused lots of tiny little bumps to appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, this is a facial product and it&#x27;s always a risk to try one as different skin types react differently to different lotions, creams, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it points for doing what it was supposed to though. Unfortunately it just wasn&#x27;t compatible with my wifes skin. Cool bottle though and I loved that it&#x27;s made in the United States</li>
    <li> Just received it. Opened the bottle. Put a drop on my face. Feels wonderful. Smells better. I&#x27;ll keep you posted as to whether or not it works on this 69 year old face.</li>
    <li> An initial hit. Too early to tell if it will do the job, but the product goes on smoothly, does not irritate, and appears to soften the wrinkles. I did not notice any apparent smell, but the product compares favorably to other skin care moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I started using this in November, 2014, and I can see a visible difference in the smoothness of my sun-damaged skin. I recommend this item.vis</li>
    <li> Everybody&#x27;s skin is different. The body&#x27;s largest organ fights infection, cools the body with sweat, grows hair, keeps itself moist with oil glands, and is extremely elastic. However, like all our organs, the skin changes with age.  Especially the skin which is exposed to damage from sun, pollutants, harsh cleansers, or just emotional stress and bad diet. Exposed skin ages faster, and needs special help. Of course, this exposed skin is the face, and hands.  The oil glands should keep the skin moist and subtle, but when things get out of hand, you get blackheads and acme. The sun can destroy the collagen that keeps the skin elastic. Pollution can irritate the skin, and harsh cleansers will strip the skin of natural oils, causing dryness, and excessive flaking. Some people will suffer from sun exposure more than others. (for example, northern Europeans who live in the southern parts of the USA, or who work outside.) People who live in NYC or LA, have skin issues from pollution, that people who live in Montana never experience. And people who eat lots of red meat, fatty foods, and don&#x27;t receive the proper nutrition, damage the skin organ, along with their other organs, over time. Drugs and alcohol damage every organ in the body, so of course it shows up on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re a man or a woman, bad skin is an immediate indicator of poor health. No matter where you live on earth, bad skin, or damaged skin, is not considered attractive. Nothing can replace the basics, like getting enough sleep, ingesting the rights Omega 3 acids, and vitamins, keeping your skin clean, avoiding excessive sun exposure, etc. No matter what you do to fight skin damage, the organ we call the skin will show signs of age. ALINA SKIN CARE developed this Vitamin C ester cream, that contains hyaluronic acid, Vitamin E, aloe vera, with green tea and white tea extract, to help the skin heal itself. All healing comes from within. Our bodies were designed to heal themselves, so as long as you provide the right environment, (good nutrition, rest, sun protection, and restorative topical treatments), you&#x27;ll find the skin WILL HEAL.  I started to use this product, and within a week, I could tell a difference. The skin above my eyelids, was starting to get wrinkly, now looks smooth. My cheeks were starting to get that way as well, but now look more firm.  Plus, my skin was looking dry, without that healthy glow.  ALINA serum gave my skin that moisture back.  Just using a little bit of this product, the size of a pea, was enough  for me to obtain better looking skin. People have even remarked to me, that my skin looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect anything to keep my skin from aging. What I do expect to achieve with skin care, is to promote skin that looks healthy, clean, and  attractive. This product is not a moisturizer, nor does it contain any sun screen. During the hot summer months, you might want to find a product to use with this, to prevent sun damage. I think what was damaging my skin, was a combination of stress, lack of sleep, and poor diet. I use acme medicine too, that dries out the skin, which led to damage. ALINA serum, with the VITAMIN C ester, seems to be a product to which my particular skin, with its particular issues, is responding well.  Some people respond well to brewing yeast, others to rare essential oils. Its all worth a shot, since topical treatments are cheaper and more natural, than a face lift.  This product is relatively inexpensive, and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company provided me this bottle to test and review., so as long as you provide the right environment, (good nutrition, rest, sun protection, and restorative topical treatments), you&#x27;ll find the skin WILL HEAL.

    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of hyaluronic acid (for hydration, and it promotes healing) and have been using various serums for over a year.  As someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, I also love Vitamin C for its ability to reverse sun damage.  I sometimes apply these item separately, but I love it when I can find a serum that has it all.  This Alina serum is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains: Vitamin C, hyluronic acid, aloe vera, Vitamin E, glycerin, green and white tea extracts (combats sun damage, protects and tightens skin).  No preservatives or other chemical additives, which makes me happy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying this serum to my clean face and neck twice a day for about two weeks, and I truly love it because it&#x27;s so moisturizing that I don&#x27;t need to apply a separate moisturizer after using it.  It leaves my skin very smooth and soft, and it appears to firm up my middle aged skin.  I especially like knowing that the Vitamin C and tea extracts are helping to counteract the aging effects of the sun on my skin.  If I&#x27;ve just exfoliated I can feel a slight tingle when I apply it, as the Vitamin C does its magic.  I wake up in the morning with beautiful skin, and I plan to purchase this serum again when my sample bottle is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Adeline serum for testing and review purposes. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for offering my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> I have only ever used some vitamin C oil on my face after washing and before moisturizer so I was excited to try this Vitamin C serum.  I am in love with it. I feel like I can skip a step in my morning and nightly routine with this serum.  It is a moisturizer with the vitamin C all in one.  It goes on smoothly, feels good and not to heavy on my skin. For reference I have combination skin that is dryer in the winter and I am 48 years old.  I love it and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels amazing on my skin, girlfriends are asking what I have been using- linked them Alina!</li>
    <li> The moisturizer works like charms everybody tells me</li>
    <li> This is the best Vitamin C on Amazon. I love how it feels on my face and the price is right. Great product.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle of the Alina Skin Care Enhanced Serum and it is not my last! I used it every morning and most nights. When I put it on my face goes from feeling dry and drab to light and healthy. It smells so good and I truly saw a difference in the youthfulness of my skin. I am glad I went with this product. The packaging is attractive and easy to use, the pump disperses the perfect amount.&lt;br /&gt;It says to use before moisturizer, but while I was using Alina I didn&#x27;t need to use moisturizer. My skin seemed to have a healthy balance of moisture and I didn&#x27;t want to take away from what Alina was doing for my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like Vitamin C serum in general for it&#x27;s help on reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but it also helps face spots that are not wanted. I have a lot of freckles on my face, and I&#x27;m not so happy with how many. So I decided to try some vitamin C serum to help try and tone them down a little bit. While it didn&#x27;t get rid of any of them, it took the color down a tone so it wasn&#x27;t quite so obvious. It does make my skin a tad sensitive to the sun, so if you use it on a daily basis, be sure to wear a good sunscreen or shade yourself with a hat or something to keep from getting a burn. The container seems small, but a little goes a long way and it will last at least a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN*</li>
    <li> Great serum! It goes on silky smooth, it&#x27;s not too thick nor too liquidy, it smells divine and it actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for over 10 days now, as I always evaluate all skin care products for about 7-10 days before sharing my opinion, and honestly, I have no plans of switching to anything else. My skin feels replenished, revitalized, refreshed and just all around rejuvenated. I&#x27;ve been applying it heavily to my under-eye areas to see if it will help minimize the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and gosh, I really think it did. Significantly! I am beyond thrilled to have discovered this product!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of a 2 in 1 Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid.  Alina&#x27;s serum smells so good -like citrus and is more like a lotion-not runny.  My skin is dehydrated and I keep putting stuff on it. It is probably worn out.  I am going to just use this serum for a few weeks.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth &amp; no make-up is needed.  I am retired so I don&#x27;t like to put on make-up after all of those years of masking my skin!  This one&#x27;s a winner! I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I use this during the day followed by another moisturizer. Sometimes I do get that tingly/stingy feeling after applying it, but it goes away pretty quickly and hopefully that is a sign that it is working :) Very nice feel and I like the light scent as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use this product at bedtime and Neutrogena wrinkle repair in the morning.  After washing my face/neck thoroughly It provides a gentle tingle and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> it was  good product I really liked the smell.</li>
    <li> Alina Skin Care Enhanced Vitamin C Serum and Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid and Green &amp; White Tea Extracts  FOR REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can claim all kinds of crazy stuff, include big words of which some maybe made up, but the truth is in the product always!.&lt;br /&gt;the wife says this is a very good lotion , and she believes it is working, as far as i can tell she is as beautiful as the day i meant her(no she is not standing over my shoulder), I am just skeptical. the lotion does not seem to react poorly with her skin like other lotions and that is a good thing,the last time she done something crazy she looked like a fighter that lost. personally all I can really saw is try it and you will see the difference your self</li>
    <li> Me, my husband and my teenage son have  used several Vitamin C serum before. Some are the liquid kind, and some are the cream kind. Most of them don&#x27;t have any smell, but quite a few are a little bit on the smelly side. They all worked good but Alina Skin Care Enhanced Vitamin C Serum, is by far, the best smelling and have the best consistency of them all! Oh how I love the subtle citrusy scent and it&#x27;s very easy to apply onto your skin. The first couple times I used it, I noticed a slight tingling on my face but then went away. Other Vitamin C serum I have tried before never had that effect on my skin. With Alina VItamin C serum, My face and skin just feels so soft and smooth and invigorated. I feel like it&#x27;s almost a crime for me to put make up on when my skin looks this good!! Right now me and hubby are sharing this bottle. He loves it too! The only &amp;#34;bad thing&amp;#34; is it smells so good you&#x27;d want to apply more of it to prolong the refreshing scent. I feel so fortunate to be able to purchase this product at a great discount to try out and review. This is the best and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS SERUM!! MOSTURIZES MY SKIN WITHOUT LEAVING A HEAVY FILM ON MY FACE. I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my skin especially around the nose area and eye corners. I am truly amazed by this product.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C is crucial for the skin, air and nails. I am a sucker for Vitamin C and tea tree extracts,This serum works wonders on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My acne scars have lightened and my skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;The big plus is that I don&#x27;t have to apply different products to softening my skin, making it glowy,lightening my scars and so on. It is all in one.&lt;br /&gt;Drink plenty of water, eat greens and apply this serum in conjunction, and you will have te Hollywood skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has only been a few weeks and my friends keep asking me what have I been doing.&lt;br /&gt;Since you apply it directly to our skin, it comes in direct contact and works faster and more efficiently as compared or eating supplements.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even smell bad. In fact, I like it&#x27;s light pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to it. No bumps, acne or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;Its consistency and feel on the skin is similar to a moisturizer. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily and greasy. The serum absorbs into the skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Once I run out of this, I will definitely be buying this again. I have already told my mother about it and she has ordered one for herself as well.&lt;br /&gt;Application: I wash my face at night, dry it and apply a few drops of  the serum onto my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a copy of this product to evaluate and I am so glad that I did.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, but gave my face a bit of a burning sensation. I have pretty sensitive skin though. Will finish the bottle but try something new next time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and see improvements in my skin - nice serum which soaks right into skin&lt;br /&gt;will re order</li>
    <li> Used as directed, did not notice any results</li>
    <li> Alina Skin Care Vitamin C Serum - a really nice serum that makes my skin look brighter and the texture is smoother when I use this consistently.  I noticed a better texture after about 3 weeks of use.  It has Hyaluronic acid and other moisturizers as well.  Very nice packaging and bottle - really like the upscale look and feel of the product - it is nice enough to give as a gift.  A lot of all natural oils and serum have a home spun look that I don&#x27;t like for gift giving this has a lovely presentation.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what convinced me to buy this serum, but I&#x27;m glad I did. The serum absorbs quickly and has an extremely great scent. It is sooo fresh when applying. A little goes a long way. Also, the ingredients are so right. A wonderful combo! I&#x27;m enjoying my use, and I feel it preparing my face for  my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery.  Satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It smells like oranges, and goes on like silk.  Most serums are very watery--but this goes on and is immediately absorbed into the skin.  I have been asked to review many different types of serums, but I must say that this is the most glorious by far.  I love that this goes on like a light cream, yet is absorbed like a watery serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it at least three times as it absorbs into my skin and it does not effect my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to review this product and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My skin does feel softer and more moist after using this serum. I can&#x27;t say that some of my deeper wrinkles have vanished - but I do think it has helped the overall tone and definitely has acted as a moisturizer. It comes out of the bottle via pump, so is easy to use and apply without waste. I did have one complaint on the pump - seems as I got about 3/4&#x27;s of the way thru the bottle the pump stopped working easily.  Maybe the straw is too short in the bottle? But, other than that issue, the product feels good on the skin and you immediately feel your skin is hydrated.  Vitamin C is needed to make collagen. As we age so does our collagen level. Collagen is needed to keep us young looking (no wrinkles, etc.). Therefore if Vitamin C is needed to make Collagen and we need Collagen -then this product is definitely worth a try. A free sample was provided for evaluation. Marilyn</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;This Serum is amazing. It feels great on the skin and smells very fresh too. My skin is usually dry and it made it very soft on the first day and continue to do its job over the next days. I have been using it for a week now and will definitely be buying some more. My skin feels amazing. This Serum also has an amazing texture. It is very smooth to the touch and does not make your skin oily at all. I am a female and just turned 30 and had never used anything on my skin before but have definitely found something worth it.</li>
    <li> I was raised to always take very good care of my skin, especially my face. I wash my face separately from anything else at least twice a day or more if I&#x27;ve had something greasy or sticky. When I was in my twenties, I started using a moisturizer since I had moved from the north east to the desert and my skin usually felt dry to me. Now that I&#x27;m in my thirties, I have upped my moisturizing to morning and night after cleansing. I thought I had things pretty well covered. I was wrong. Very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this serum, I thought it would just be a once in a while thing if I liked it. The very first night I tried it, it felt SO good that I nearly skipped my moisturizer. I kissed my husband on my way to the bedroom and he commented that I smelled nice. The serum was the only scent I had on at the time, so I knew I wasn&#x27;t the only one who liked the scent. It felt smooth and a little tingly. When it dried, before I put on my usual moisturizer, I stroked my cheek and I was surprised at how smooth it felt. That was it, I was in love. I use it every night after my shower and final face wash of the day. I still don&#x27;t use it in the morning, but I probably will when I reach my next decade. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, FAIR AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT*</li>
    <li> I like this product, go on very smooth and smells great. I use a pump in the morning and a pump at night and I am already running out it and it&#x27;s only been close to 2 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin yet but I like the fact this is not irritating or cause any redness.  Does. It sting either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product over all but wish the size was bigger and more affordable. I would buy again if it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like the moisturizer. I have oily skin, I wear the moisturizer after toner in summer. It is perfect for my skin, not oily at all. The moisturizer also went on very smooth as well. The moisturizer also smell wonderful, which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Really good product and smell very nice.  Would buy again but it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I used this for a week or so and started to notice that my skin was drying out, in the middle of a muggy summer.</li>
    <li> As I have aged, I have tried numerous products recommended by friends of the same age. So many of the serums that I have previously tried are watery, slimy or so thick that I feel like I&#x27;m wearing 10 lbs. on my face. I also don&#x27;t have to wait for what seems like forever for the serum to absorb into my skin. It does my face absolutely NO good if it just sits on top. The faster the absorption, the better it works! After wearing the serum for a few days, I noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin (it&#x27;s much softer!) and stays moisturized all day long. My skin is super-sensitive and acne-prone to products full of junk but Alina has surpassed a line of other products. I prefer to rotate my use of products but this one has definitely made the list to be used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample bottle for reviewing purposes. All opinions are 100% my own!</li>
    <li> i love this serum and will be purchasing more i use it with my JENU</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have used other, more expensive brands and just wanted to try something that didn&#x27;t break the bank. I actually think it works better than my more expensive version! It tingles a little when you put it on, which always lets me know something is happening. Not sure if thats good or bad, but I like it. It works well with my Obagi products and doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy. Its a light serum that can easily be put under any other products! I use it morning and night and I have noticed my skin is much brighter. Not so much in the wrinkle department, but the tone is much improved.</li>
    <li> I like the product! Seems to work making skin soft and pores a little smaller.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks now, and have notice an incredible difference in the brightness and evenness of my skin tone. My hormonal breakouts have been dramatically reduced, and my skin just feels fantastic. I have really sensitive skin that gets red and blotchy at the slightest irritation, and I have been able to ward off redness with Alina. Time for a refill!</li>
    <li> This serum is a rich cream.  It asorbs well and softens your skin after one use.  Some may find it a little heavy for facial use, and in that case, it works great on hands.  It has a fresh citrus scent.  Complimentary sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I used twice and little bumps are coming up. Do I have to stop using this product?</li>
    <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love the smell as much as the previous Vitamin C serum I used.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and a few fine expression lines that I had on my forehead disappeared! Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Heavenly fresh grapefruit/mandarin orange scent from natural oils. One of the best smelling creams I’ve ever tested.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Smooth, like a medium weight lotion.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Smooth and soft, but with no film or greasy sensation.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Probably suitable for all. No issues with my oily and sensitive skin, it actually feels great to me.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 1oz frosted glass bottle with pump top. With care, pump will dispense exactly how much you want, but if you’re careless you’ll get a huge squirt.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Fine lines and wrinkles are reduced and skin has a nice glow. Very slight mattifying of oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* There are not a huge number of active ingredients but they have been chosen with care. There are two forms of vitamin C, one is an ester I don’t see often in skin care products that looks more stable and penetrating. Hyaluronic acid is a must, niacinimide good, PEG-23 Glyceryl Distearate looks like an excellent anti-inflammatory for red and irritated skin, vitamin B6 good. I don’t get too worked up about white and green tea and aloe, but they are good ingredients in general. I think this is the most effectively formulated vitamin C serum I’ve tested so far, and should be excellent for your skin in the long term. Thumbs up on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

    <li> I have tried a variety of these C serums and this one is pretty comparable to the other brands.  This is a creamy serum that is white in color that goes on smoothly like a lotion and absorbs into the skin without feeling greasy or oily.  You don’t have to use a lot as a little bit really covers a sizeable area.  I have sensitive skin but this one doesn’t irritate my skin and moisturizes my skin pretty well.  Unlike some brands that doesn’t smell nice or others with no scent at all, this one actually smells like fresh oranges.  I have only been using this a few days and will update my long term results in comparison to the other brands I have tried and will reserve my final rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> After just a few days of using this I noticed changes in my completion. :)</li>
    <li> Not any better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> 1st off my husband said he wanted to eat/lick my face. He loved the orange smell. It is completely moisterizing I loved the way my face feels after I put on the Alina skin care enhanced vitamin c serum. It&#x27;s a daily bedtime routine key piece before I shut my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review</li>
    <li> After using for just a few days the pump dispenser quit working.  When I removed the top I realized the bottle was only about 2/3rds full.  I realize product is sold by weight but still a little disconcerting.  It is too early to tell if it is effective.  It has a pleasant smell and a little goes a long way.  If it tightens my neck at all I will gladly put up with a bad pump.</li>
    <li> I received this serum free for review, and I must admit I love it! I have only been using it for a couple of days but I can already see myself buying another one. It smells heavenly and moisturizes my skin so well. The instructions say to apply a moisturizer afterwards but I feel like it isn&#x27;t needed.  My face feels so smooth! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks and feels after a couple weeks of using this!</li>
    <li> really drying on my face</li>
    <li> I love this serum. Smells like oranges and my face feels amazing after applying. I was afraid the price would dramatically increase like so many products do, I bought another as back up, just in case.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is pretty pricey and does not last as long as other serums, despite being 1 fl. oz. like others.  This Alina product tends to go quickly because it&#x27;s actually more of a lotion-like consistency than a liquid.  Because of this, you tend to pump out more from the bottle than you really need.  I&#x27;m not sure how effective the vitamin C ester is, as I&#x27;m sure one would need to use this product for at least a couple of months before any results can be clearly determined.  The bottle as is will last a month or two if you are really conservative with use.  It&#x27;s said this product doubles as a moisturizer, but that has definitely not been the case for me.  After applying, it absorbs very quickly, but also dries very quickly.  Application of a moisturizer afterward is definitely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid full price for this item, and would certainly not pay full price for it again, especially since any potential results would likely take months.  Product does smell good, though.</li>
    <li> This product is great for your skin. It smells amazing and feels really good on my face and hands. Plus I got the bottle for free with free shipping. You can&#x27;t beat that price. Thank you so much for your generosity!</li>
    <li> I initially received a complimentary bottle of Alina to try out. I loved it right away -- so much that when I ran out, I immediately went and purchased another bottle. It feels good and smells so great. I saw results quickly and in the several months that I&#x27;ve been using it, my skin looks and feels great. Just last week I received a complement about how gorgeous my skin is. I will definitely keep using this product. Thanks Alina!</li>
    <li> I am a tester for Amazon products and have been given the opportunity by a product testing club to try quite a few vit C face serums and creams. I am not paid in any way, but I do receive the products for free or for a reduced price. I have targeted different problem areas on my skin for the different products to get a fair assessment of each formula. Alina vit C serum is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried. It is a light cream that sinks in quickly and leaves no oilyness. It smells wonderful. It&#x27;s a true orange scent, light, but fragrant. Almost immediately I saw wrinkle reduction, and over the last 10 days I am now seeing a reduction in dark spots. My skin is a bit sensitive so I make sure to use a sunscreen after I use it. All in all, this product does exactly what it promises and I am quite happy with the results.  Please see pic for product ingredients</li>
    <li> just got it yesterday, so i cannot speak to its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;BUT...i love the smell and the texture!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Alina Skin Care Enhanced Vitamin C Serum and Moisturizer, and I have to say, the first thing I noticed when I tested it is the wonderful scent of oranges/citrus. This was right up there with other, more expensive vitamin C products I&#x27;ve tested in the past, but this one is a nice, creamy, not too thick lotion (I know it&#x27;s a mix between a serum and a moisturizer, so it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s a littler thicker than other serums out there and easier to put on) that doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. The Alina lotion goes on and absorbs so quickly, leaving my skin feel so soft and hydrated, though if you still want to put on a moisturizer on top, it doesn&#x27;t feel like overkill (I&#x27;ll put one on at night). I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week, and there&#x27;s been no breakouts, no adverse effects and my skin looks wonderful. I will be interested in whatever else Alina has in their skincare line.</li>
    <li> This cream smells amazing and leaves my skin soft and smooth...I have tried a lot of different serums and Alina is one of my new favorites. Seller is prompt and easy to work with as well. If you want a light weight moisturizer, this is a great serum.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended to me by a friend and I decided to give it a try. I have never used anything similar. In fact I barely use anything on my skin. After using this serum for only one time I noticed a huge difference on my skin. My skin felt the softest it has ever felt. This Serum is amazing. It smells good, sits light on your skin and it definitely does the job of making your skin look gorgeous. I have been using it for a week now and will definitely be buying it again. This serum also got to my house on the day it was supposed to and very well packaged. I am happy to have found a product that makes a difference. I have always had oily skin and this serum does not make it oily at all. I am very happy with the company as well and customer service. I will be recommending this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Received the product for free for review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing! I gave this a few days and it was just wow. I&#x27;ve tried a number of things, but I either get dried out skin, my face got worse or it just didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for anyone with sensitive skin and it does work. I&#x27;ve got softer, brighter, and overall healthier skin. It does what its supposed to do and I love the fact that it smells like oranges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on light, not too thick or liquid. Just put the stuff on and go about your day. You&#x27;ll smell great and get some amazing skin.</li>
    <li> I am a fair skinned red head with a great interest in good care for my complexion and decollete.&lt;br /&gt;Alina Skin Care Enhanced Vitamin C Serum and Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid and Green &amp; White Tea Extracts is a remarkably effective serum. It has smoothed and gently&lt;br /&gt;erased my wrinkles on neck and face effectively, while simultaneously smelling deliciously like oranges. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;Alina is a find!&lt;br /&gt;I choose to put this serum right up there with the top serums.&lt;br /&gt;Before I put on my makeup, I put on Alina. Then I gently rub my face.I feel the smoothest of textures. That is my skin, immediately changed. How? Through the amazing serum, Alina Skin Care serum. I notice a dramatic difference in my skin&#x27;s fineness and smooth quality. The combination of the Vitamin C, the Acid, and the Tea Extracts are wonderful. I love Alina! It does not irritate my skin even slightly. I know there is a note here on Amazon concerning that, but it smooth and comfortable here. And yes, the smell is incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to review this lovely product; offered to me by the company ~ Jean</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! The cream leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized...and it smells awesome. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks and I already notice a difference in my overall skin tone. I have tried other vitamin C serum&#x27;s and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and very silky feeling.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum by Alina is amazing.  This is different than other serums I have used.  This combines the serum and moisturizer in one.  I have used some serums that leave my skin feeling sticky.  This serum goes on very silky and smooth.  This serum also combines other great ingredients that are great for your skin. I love that they use Vitamin C Ester which is proven to be gentle, compared to other serums that contain high levels of Vitamin C.  The smell of this serum is also amazing, it is not overpowering.  Another fabulous thing is this is made in the USA.  I love it.  I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
    <li> I was looking a serum with vitamin C and hyaluronic acid. I found this finally. Vitamin C for even skin tone. And hyaluronic acid for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. The 1st time I applied too thick serum on my face. And it was a little painful on the first 10 min. So the 2nd time I just applied a thin layer. And not painful any more. I have used it for 3 days when I&#x27;m writing this review. Since the time is too short, I can&#x27;t tell any difference of my skin. But it really helps reducing the redness. I think the  Aloe Vera in the serum did this.</li>
    <li> Works well but ran out really quickly. I have since moved on to another product.</li>
    <li> Love it! It makes my skin soft and shining. Definitely will buy one more.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, so I just noticed my face with more even color, bright. Just consider it&#x27;s not moisturizer at all, my skin absorbes it all in seconds. I use it before a good moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, consistency, and hydrating feel to this syrum. I can feel a bit of a tingle when I first put it on, which feels kind of cool, and that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s working. I use it at morning and night everyday and am on my second bottle. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to prevent future damage to their skin from harmful free radicals, start an easy anti-aging regimen, or simply to hydrate the skin. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it&#x27;s the only serum I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others on the market. I figure there&#x27;s always room for improvement, but I don&#x27;t intend to use other serums anytime soon. This one is awesome!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve been trying this serum for a couple of weeks now and it&#x27;s definitely one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried. This is a small bottle but I do feel like you don&#x27;t really use much to begin with anyway so this should last a good amount of time. The serum absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s too heavy. I&#x27;ve only recently started using any sort of serum at all but to be honest I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change yet. The first serum I tried was very thick. So much so it almost felt sticky. It didn&#x27;t have much of a smell and this one has a light scent to it. I think I&#x27;ll keep using this one and give the other one to a friend. I&#x27;ll be updating if there was any sort of change to my skin in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product free for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  My skin feels and looks great after only a few days of use.  I used to use this generic brand skin lotion every day and now I just use this Alina serum and my skin looks ten times better.  Would definitely recommend this product to a friend.  Thank you Alina!</li>
    <li> I have never used any moisturizers until the past year, but late middle age finally caught up with me. To keep roughness and redness at bay, I&#x27;ve been trying out several brands of moisturizers, turning it into a bit of an experiment. I was offered this one for a review, so I put it up against Boots System 7 and L&#x27;oreal Revitalift. All are in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum smooths as well as any of the others I&#x27;ve tried, perhaps a shade better. It&#x27;s the only one with hyaluronic acid, which, if I understand correctly, is its main active ingredient for smoothing. (I think the Vitamin C is mostly there for marketing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does tingle when applied, ever after several applications, and none of the others do that. It also has more scent than the System 7, which is almost odorless. The scent is a not-unpleasant citrusy smell, but my own preference is as little scent as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if I use it too many times in a row, I get some mild red irritation in couple of key spots. So I alternate it with one of the other serums. Overly, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results of that arrangement.</li>
    <li> Shes been testing it for awhile of course it needs some time to check and see the result, so far it helps her skin from dryness, if you will search about Alina Skin Care it is a Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid  (anti-aging formula) that is uniquely formulated to deliver the brightness, radiance and even tone of youthful skin. Just apply a small amount to your face, neck and use this in the morning and at night before going to bed and continue using this everyday and you will see the result within 7 days. And i received this for free in exchange of my review, and she got a better result in testing it, so for sure she will continue using ALINA.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference after first use alina.Since using this product people ask me if I have had work done. My cheeks are smooth firmer and my face dramatically improved. Thus right one for me and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Better then any other on the market . recommended I got this under promotional item with my Honest review and own opinion</li>
    <li> For me this was eh, so so. I did love the smell. But I can&#x27;t say I felt a difference in my skin texture .</li>
    <li> This is a nice serum. I have tried lots of similar serums, well this one will be in my top 10 choices if you were looking for vitamin serums. This one is based on hyaluronic acid that is full of great qualities for skin. I like that this serum has anti-aging properties. I love the packaging - it will be great for a gift for someone you appreciate. I love the scent - very cirtusy and mild, not too strong, but at the same time very refreshing. I like the consistency. This serum is a bit whiter than I see usual creams with hyaluronic acid. I like that. The texture is great, not too liquid, easy to apply on the skin. I also like how fast it absorbs in the skin - there is no residue from this serum after you apply it. My skin doesn&#x27;t tug anywhere, it is not making my face tight at all. Easy to apply under your makeup as it immediately dries, and no need to wait for half an hour before putting on the next layer of your makeup and skincare routine. What a great product! I have received this product for free for a review.</li>
    <li> I am So excited to leave this review!!!  This is a very nice product, that works well.  The vitamins are inside are very pleasing to your skin. Its a nice thickness, not to runny or thick.  It smells delicious, and I REALLY like this one.  I feel as though its bringing the youthful glow back to my skin.  I am trying to bring back the elasticity to my skin, and I believe that this is the best product I have used.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to improve their skin.  Its very much worth the price in return for the benefits to your skin.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to decide how I feel about it. However, shipping was excellent!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It was recommended to me that using Vitamin C Serum was essential part of a skin care regiment. The great reviews and reasonable price lead me to purchase this product. I had some deep pimples that I had attempted to get rid of but couldn&#x27;t, too deep. I can&#x27;t say for sure, but after using this product twice daily for about a month they started coming to the surface and I was able to finally get rid of them. Needless to say, my skin is clearer and smoother. I&#x27;m getting my daughters started on it as well. 👍🏻</li>
    <li> Received for free for review, it makes my skin feel tighter. It gives me really smooth soft skin, it smells a little like oranges too. Love it for my face.</li>
    <li> Have not used before. So far, I like the Alina skin lotion.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this, goes on smooth and feels light on my skin, not heavy.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and look forward to seeing the results.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 3 days so maybe not long enough to form an opinion.  I notice no difference in my skin at all.</li>
    <li> i received this product at a promotional price to give my honest opinion..i used this yesterday and today and i have got to say this after just 3 uses this is truly the best vitamin serum ive used up till now!! i applied a small amount to my face and neck and my skin already feels much smoother and so yes i would def recommend!!</li>
    <li> You can feel it working... Half way through the bottle and I can certainly see a difference in my skin!!!</li>
    <li> I used so many different products past time. I like this one so much because this one is almost the price and function winner.&lt;br /&gt; When I received the offer I actually was in the market and had been trying new things as I was having an issue with the facial skin just being really dry to the point of flaking no matter what I tried /used. It was driving me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this I was happy to note NO adverse reactions and it smells great. like orange, my favorite smell.  At the same time this lotion feels soothing to me - usually when my skin is this dry I experience (and have come to expect) the sting when applying lotion but no sting here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love about Alina is the lack of greasy or sticky feeling - it actually just feels smooth so I don&#x27;t have that urge to wash it off. This feels like a pretty generous size, I feel like it&#x27;ll last me months, if not longer. A little bit seems to go a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, based on my experience with this product, I&#x27;m hoping the Alina company expands into others such as body washes, soaps, etc. - I&#x27;d probably try anything of theirs at this point.</li>
    <li> I have received this product for free for my HONEST review of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of these serums but this is the best one by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With in days of starting to use it I could see a Great difference in my skin. My Husband also said that my skin looked much healthier to him and felt so much softer than it ever has</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect at first, but now I admit that I really like this product. It acts as a great moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely planning on purchasing more in the future:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m in a bunch of review communities so I&#x27;ve tested quite a few vitamin C serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I found that the sent was pleasant, very orange scent. The aesthetics of the glass bottle are great and the pump is also nice as many serums only come with an eye dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: This is actually more of a cream then a true serum, it&#x27;s thick and opaque like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I believe it&#x27;s too heavy with orange oil, it causes my face to feel dry, it stings a little, and feels heavier on the skin than other serums I&#x27;ve used. It also made my skin break out a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t personally like it with the current formula, perhaps a few tweaks and it would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
    <li> This serum felt so smooth and silky on my skin!  Absorbed quickly and left no sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can feel it working.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m sure people may just say that, but I RARELY write reviews and I am confident that this is one of the best vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve ever used. It comes in a small bottle but with a convenient pump so there&#x27;s little to no waste. It has a creamy consistency that soaks into your skin fast and leaves it with a cool feeling. It smells deliciously light and citrusy. I&#x27;ve used several products before and haven&#x27;t noticed the results like this. I use this under my moisturizer and before makeup in the morning. A little goes a long way. I only use one pump to cover my face and neck area. I&#x27;ve received compliments on my complexion and skin tone. I even had someone ask if I had &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done because I look so much more youthful and fresh! I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have an assortment of Vitamin C products for the skin, particularly for the face, but not a one can compare with the Alina product.  The bottle is sturdy, the applicator is flawless, but oh my goodness, this serum is beyond wonderful and I am not exaggerating.  This moisturizer made an immediately favorable impression and I was saying, ¨Oh my God, Oh my God,¨ as I gently rubbed a little dab onto my freshly washed face.  First of all, the scent is on the citrus side, but so light that it is delicious.  The serum was absorbed very quickly, but not like some do where it is drunk by the skin and leaves nothing to spread.  This one spreads smoothly, but is extremely light, so a tiny bit covers the entire face.  The skin feels smooth, and I mean very smooth, to the touch and it lasts.  This is a winning product which I know will generate a huge following once it is tried.  Some of my C serums and moisturizers are good for one aspect of skin care, but this one has them all.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that as I use it, there will be less left in the bottle.  Really, it is that good.  I received a sample for review, but this is the one I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> My mortician brother says my red blotchy skin will look its best after death and with the help of mortuary wizardry.  He&#x27;s probably right, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from trying to improve my appearance while I&#x27;m still alive.  This is the first time I have ever used a Vitamin C serum, and I&#x27;m impressed.  When my bottle of Alina arrived, I put a dab on the top of one hand.  It visibly took away the redness and imparted a much more even and natural looking skin tone.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and neck ever since, with similar even toned results.  Only a small amount is needed to cover those areas, and its citrusy fragrance makes this cream even more appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients include Vitamin C ester, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera extract, Vitamin E, glycerin, green and white tea extract.  It&#x27;s a good solution for red blotchy skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample for impartial review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old and felt like there was no hope for my skin. Don&#x27;t know what made me try this, but I love it. It goes on so smooth and light and smells so good. It will be my go-to skin care.</li>
    <li> This is a truly amazing product! I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I have no complaints so far. My skin is left feeling refreshed and baby soft! I will be the first to recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
