      <li>The brow wiz is my first love 😍</li>
      <li>Is a good brow liner and color is perfect for by dark brown almost black hair.</li>
      <li>so i would use a black eyebrow pencil because all of the colors i would find would be wayyyy to light for my eyebrows, so I&#x27;m really glad that I was able to find this ebony color.</li>
      <li>Best eyebrow pencil- very thin point enables you to use easily.</li>
      <li>Love natural too</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>and I love that there are so many shades to choose from compared to other brands.</li>

      <li>The brow brush was wonderful however the actual eyeliner sucks!</li>
      <li>it is not the real Anastasia Brow Wiz.</li>
      <li>Plus, the color is great if you have dark brown or black brows.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect blendable shade for my skin and hair (other colors are too brown or too dark and black)</li>
      <li>I have eyebrows and they look very natural.</li>
      <li>I have always used a pencil with a brush at the end for my eyebrows, but this ebony color is great and not too dark and thick when I apply it to the part of my eyebrows nearest the nose.</li>
      <li>My eyebrow looks natural even when i wear this.</li>
      <li>Looks natural.</li>
      <li>I have very little, think, light hairs on my eyebrows and</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my eyebrows are a hot mess, and I was fighting doing anything with makeup</li>

    <li> Using for 2 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t lasted all day as others have told me, but then, I don&#x27;t use the stencil to create the eyebrows, I fill in the brows because age has thinned them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my eyebrows are a hot mess, and I was fighting doing anything with makeup but  I have to say that this eyebrow pencil is awesome!  It goes on smoothly and evenly.  The spoolie thingie helps blend it with your eyebrows so it doesn&#x27;t look like someone took a crayon and drew harsh lines above your eyes.  Its is easy to use and it stays on all day.  I find that removing it is easiest when I use lotion or coconut oil.  I would definitley buy this again and I would buy from this seller.</li>

    <li> I love this brow wiz. I tried the &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; buy NYX and even though I love it, it does not compare to the brow wiz. Eyebrows on Fleek ✅ every time. The brow wiz is my first love 😍</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect perfect perfect.</li>
    <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the dang filler falls out of the pencil all of the time. It works great but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great color not overbearing</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow pencil I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow pencil!!</li>
    <li> I never really have gotten to use it because I was sent the wrong color, and I haven&#x27;t had any clients that are better suited for it. I wanted to return it, but i just put it in my make up kit hoping I&#x27;ll use it on someone.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love! I have always used a pencil with a brush at the end for my eyebrows, but this ebony color is great and not too dark and thick when I apply it to the part of my eyebrows nearest the nose. I have naturally dark brown hair so i would use a black eyebrow pencil because all of the colors i would find would be wayyyy to light for my eyebrows, so I&#x27;m really glad that I was able to find this ebony color.

It was very easy to use, a very precise and light tip, not too harsh making the brows look very natural! It blew me away! It is perfect for those who have very little hair</li>
    <li> Broken pieces when I got it. Too little product for price. Is a good brow liner and color is perfect for by dark brown almost black hair.</li>
