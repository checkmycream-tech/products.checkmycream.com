      <li>After you&#x27;ve finished with the scrub, use the message oil and lotion of the same scent--It&#x27;s my own mini spa!</li>
      <li>I first received it as a gift, and was so excited to find out I could buy more on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I even use it to scrub my head on non-shave days just to get that clean feel and stay moisturized.</li>
      <li>I did steer clear of the argan oil scrub when I was pregnant because even though the smell is nice, it was a bit too strong for my ultra-sensitive sense of smell.</li>

      <li>I used to have super super itchy skin on my legs</li>
      <li>Leaves skin smooth and soft and clean!</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it.  </li>
      <li>so far I&#x27;m in love(:</li>
      <li>Most of the so-called body scrubs that were available were much too gentle on the skin, and would barely exfoliate at all.  </li>
      <li>I have tried all of the different scrubs, and I love them all.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous natural product.</li>
      <li>I use it on my face every morning in the shower instead of the cheap, full of chemicals facial scrub I used before.</li>
      <li>And after using it my skin feels super soft and it feels like is a moisturizer</li>
      <li>Makes my skin super soft</li>
      <li>Nice smell, but not special.</li>
      <li>I use the whole line now and it works for me.</li>
      <li>This stuff really moisturizes, the scent in it does not bother me, and I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had any bumps, hives or breakouts from it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really helpful and also smells</li>
      <li>this scrub really helps me</li>
      <li>I really like the idea of combining oil (the one you can really feel) and scrub in one jar.</li>
      <li>and this really helps in helping my Tinea Versicolor stay at bay.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled that I could find the Olive and Green Tea version online.  </li>
      <li>I live live live this scrub!!  </li>
      <li>The skin is soft and moistened really well after use.</li>
      <li>I live in New Mexico which is one of the driest places in America.</li>

      <li>I use it every day starting to see changes from the first day i use it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love all the Shea Moisture Olive and Green Tea products!</li>
      <li>I loved the way my skin get moisturized after using this scrub, but i&#x27;m not sure if this scrub really removed the dead cells.</li>
      <li>This leaves my dry skin soft and smooth for several days.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation from using either.</li>
      <li>It definately makes your skin feel luxuriously soft.</li>
      <li>All natural and smells wondeful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s completely luxurious.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for something to make their rough dry skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This body scrub is the first product I&#x27;ve found that helps my dry desert skin.  </li>
      <li>And you really don&#x27;t need to use a huge amount of this scrub when using it, a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I have done so much research on scrubs and exfoliating products and I was so surprised that something so simple can make a big difference in the health of our skin.</li>
      <li>I will most definitely purchase this in the future and give the rest of this Organic Olive and Green Tea line (lotions, oils, body butter)</li>

<li> This:  http://amzn.to/1HuUex6  made my skin glow like crazy!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Pricey but worth it.  This stuff does wonders on my legs, especially for taking care of ingrown hairs due to shaving.  It is so moisturizing.  I leave it on my legs after rubbing it in while I shampoo and condition my hair and then rinse it off.  Leaves my legs very soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I prefer the lavender one.</li>
    <li> Love this, apply to my body and even face while in sauna and/or shower!</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. Scrub does a great job. I use this all over then rinse off&lt;br /&gt;and then use Dove body wash to shave with. Even my fiancé likes this and it helps to remove the caked on grime and oil from his hands after work. My only complaint is that every time I use this my ankles, feet, and sometimes hands are tingly afterwards for at least 20 minutes, which makes falling asleep at night difficult. That&#x27;s the only reason it gets four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really in love with this product.. It&#x27;s really helpful and also smells good ❤️❤️</li>
    <li> The product is great. I really like the idea of combining oil (the one you can really feel) and scrub in one jar. The skin is soft and moistened really well after use. Works especially great on feet.</li>
    <li> Loved this scrub.  Worked great without making the shower slippery</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin smooth!</li>
    <li> Divine in every sense of the word! I had some not-so-smooth areas(feet and elbows) that this scrub made a non issue. The smell is clean and refreshing and although this is a scrub, it doesnt feel like you&#x27;re scraping sandpaper all over your body. It definately makes your skin feel luxuriously soft. After you&#x27;ve finished with the scrub, use the message oil and lotion of the same scent--It&#x27;s my own mini spa!</li>
    <li> love this scrub and it smells amazing. I have EXTRA DRY skin in the winter this scrub really helps me</li>
    <li> Love this product!! This scrub is nothing short of A M A Z I N G (: I have very dry skin and it works wonders I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry dull skin! I have tinea versicolor (dry skin fungus) and this really helps in helping my Tinea Versicolor stay at bay. Like I said if you don&#x27;t have this in your skin regimen go get you some I will most definitely purchase this in the future and give the rest of this Organic Olive and Green Tea line (lotions, oils, body butter) a try so far I&#x27;m in love(:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this scrub!!! My skin is like silk after each use. Its the best scrub I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s completely luxurious. Better than a spa! You will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this and tried it and loved it! Now I order the entire line. I am allergic to EVERYTHING - perfumes, soaps, makeups, lotion. You name it, I&#x27;ve probably had a reaction to it. AND I haven&#x27;t had a reaction to this! I live in New Mexico which is one of the driest places in America. This stuff really moisturizes, the scent in it does not bother me, and I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had any bumps, hives or breakouts from it. I can recommend it - if you have allergies, try it on a small patch of skin first like I did. I use the whole line now and it works for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I first received it as a gift, and was so excited to find out I could buy more on Amazon. I use it on my face every morning in the shower instead of the cheap, full of chemicals facial scrub I used before. I am in my 50&#x27;s and feel it does a great job as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Nice smell, but not special. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. Fabulous natural product. leaves skin smooth and delicious.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also using Shea moisture body wash in combination with the scrub. I use this once every two weeks which helps with my dry skin. My skin is sensitive and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation from using either. The scent is amazing! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if I happened to get a bad batch.  The scent is wonderful and I would love to use it however it is completely dried up and clumpy.  There&#x27;s no oil left.  I&#x27;m not sure if this was stored in a place with high heat or humidity, but I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this, I bought it recently for her and she tells me &amp;#34;it&#x27;s nice and moisturizing&amp;#34;. She also likes the scent because it gives her a calming and refreshing feeling. The container is plastic but it&#x27;s strong and the lid fits tightly (these are important to her).</li>
    <li> The best scrub hands down.</li>
    <li> it does everything is supposed to do. I use it every day starting to see changes from the first day i use it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin super soft</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how it leaves your skin soft and with a light oil feel</li>
    <li> I loved the way my skin get moisturized after using this scrub, but i&#x27;m not sure if this scrub really removed the dead cells.</li>
    <li> This body scrub is the first product I&#x27;ve found that helps my dry desert skin.  It is a good product, sent in a sealed package that is well priced.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled that I could find the Olive and Green Tea version online.  Some of the other scents are over-powering.  This leaves my dry skin soft and smooth for several days.</li>
    <li> I mostly use this to scrub/exfoliate my head before shaving. I get a nice clean head shave and it seems to reduce irritation during and after the shave. I even use it to scrub my head on non-shave days just to get that clean feel and stay moisturized. Also, my woman loves it because my head smells delicious after I use it. And, it only takes a little to do the job so it will probably last a while. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used to have super super itchy skin on my legs and I have decided to try this and is amazing !!! Is the only thing that has helped my itchy skin .. And after using it my skin feels super soft and it feels like is a moisturizer</li>
    <li> It does the work pretty good and I love that it&#x27;s organic... but nothing will beat this:  http://amzn.to/1HuUex6  when it comes to exfoliation. I have done so much research on scrubs and exfoliating products and I was so surprised that something so simple can make a big difference in the health of our skin. This:  http://amzn.to/1HuUex6  made my skin glow like crazy! It not only exfoliates your skin, it detoxifies it as well, working in harmony with our lymph system. Some people who have acne and psoriasis actually healed their skin using this.</li>
    <li> Like the way it feels on my skin. All natural and smells wondeful. Leaves skin smooth and soft and clean!</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago, I went on a search to find a body scrub that actually exfoliated your skin without being too abrasive.  Most of the so-called body scrubs that were available were much too gentle on the skin, and would barely exfoliate at all.  I went to TARGET, and finally found one with the texture I was looking for: the Shea Moisture raw shea and argan oil body scrub.  I was instantly hooked.  I have tried all of the different scrubs, and I love them all.  I did steer clear of the argan oil scrub when I was pregnant because even though the smell is nice, it was a bit too strong for my ultra-sensitive sense of smell. I had never tried the olive oil and green tea type before recently, but I had received the olive oil massage and body oil as a gift, and wanted to try the scrub along with it.  The scent is very pleasant and light, it exfoliates your skin without hurting it, and leaves your skin soft and smooth with or without the addition of the oil.  Compared to other brands with similar products, the price of this stuff is really not that bad.  And you really don&#x27;t need to use a huge amount of this scrub when using it, a little goes a long way. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for something to make their rough dry skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I live live live this scrub!!  The smell and texture is amazing</li>
    <li> Absolutely love all the Shea Moisture Olive and Green Tea products!</li>
