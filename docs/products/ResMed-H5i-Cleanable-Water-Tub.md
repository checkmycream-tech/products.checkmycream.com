      <li>This one opens easy with tabs that lock it shut.</li>
      <li>I love that I can take the cover off and clean it.</li>
      <li>It is taken apart easily and can be put in the dishwasher, or washed by hand.  </li>

      <li>No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
      <li>Works well and easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean and use.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to take apart to clean.</li>
      <li>This makes is so easy to clean, which I now do every two days.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean unlike the tub my cpap came with.</li>
      <li>Far superior to the stock tank that came with my ResMed CPAP, which could not be opened to be cleaned.  </li>
      <li>The price is right if you enjoy being able to know that your humidifier is clean.</li>
      <li>Once separated, cleaning in a sink is quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>I tried to order one of these from someone else before and they sent me the original one.  </li>
      <li>Original replacement parts.</li>
      <li>Replaced my husband&#x27;s original tub with this one.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Trash your original and get one of these.</li>
      <li>and now I feel that I&#x27;m getting it clean since it can be opened.  </li>
      <li>After I took it apart to clean it</li>
      <li>I was told that I could clean this tub in the dishwasher.</li>
      <li>Because you can clean inside.</li>
      <li>and I still can clean the water chamber.  </li>
      <li>The tub was sealed so basically all you could do to clean</li>
      <li>This is far better better than the stock ResMed water tub, because it can be taken apart for thorough cleaning and disinfection.</li>
      <li>that I can easily clean.</li>
      <li>This one features a better seal, and more importantly, an easy to read water level yellow tab.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to keep clean!</li>
      <li>The original equipment product was difficult to get apart and wasn&#x27;t supposed to come apart, so this is nice to be able to clean it so easily!</li>
      <li>This is an easy to clean unit, it&#x27;s dis-assembles and re-assembles very well, and seams to be very study in construction.</li>
      <li>Love it because I can wash the 3 pieces separately and don&#x27;t see gunk in between the outer clear piece and metal piece (which is why I trashed the one that came with the CPAP machine).  </li>
      <li>The price was right as well.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really get it clean all the way.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Unlike the standard tub, this cleanable tub comes apart in three sections: bottom tank, clear top, and square plastic locking &#x27;ring&#x27; that connects the top and bottom sections.  </li>
      <li>This one is much nicer than the one that originally came with the machine, easier to take apart and easier to see how much water is in the tub.</li>
      <li>Before I trashed my old 1, I took it apart and couldn&#x27;t get it to fit together anymore.  </li>
      <li>When I first got a cPap machine it came with a one-piece water tub</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This tub is much more robust than the standard washable tub that comes packed with the H5i humidifier.</li>
      <li>The ResMed Water Tub is exactly what it is supposed to be.  </li>
      <li>They should have thought of it the first time.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I wish I knew about this years ago when I first got my cpap machine.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and get dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Added this device to the original setup and it fit in and worked perfectly. If you need to replace the water module this is the one</li>
    <li> This tub fit the machine perfectly and was cleanable in that the clear top was removable. Recommend treat tub and hose with vinegar monthly.</li>
    <li> HAPPY to have this - my first was the one that can&#x27;t be taken apart. This is GREAT to clean and take a part.</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy to clean unlike the tub my cpap came with.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly, works every bit as well as the original.  My first tub started to corrode after I had to use tap water, which left some crystals on the bottom due to the mineral content.</li>
    <li> Came undamaged and works great.  I love being able to take it apart to clean.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  As advertised</li>
    <li> I tried to order one of these from someone else before and they sent me the original one.  Living overseas at a military base makes it pretty hard to want to wait for a return order to get fixed.  Very pleased with this and will buy another one when I need to you from you, thanks!</li>
    <li> This was ordered for my mom and she really likes this one as it can be taken apart and cleaned. The original equipment product was difficult to get apart and wasn&#x27;t supposed to come apart, so this is nice to be able to clean it so easily!</li>
    <li> Great product easy to clean</li>
    <li> I was told that I could clean this tub in the dishwasher. However, after running it in dishwasher (on top rack) twice, the tub no longer closes.  I own a Bosch dishwasher with no heating element. I can only assume that the heat from water warped it somehow. Anyway, I&#x27;m buying another -- which I will wash by hand in warm water.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because the one that came with my machine was one piece and I was unable to clean it good. I was completely happy. It is just like the one my husband got with his machine. It snaps apart and is easy to clean and is excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Been through the dishwasher three times with no signs of any wear or damage and it comes out very clean! Maintenance just became a lot more easy.</li>
    <li> perfect but a lot heavier than the original one I had. Maybe better quality? It does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s CPAP machine because he refuses to use distilled water, and his old one was heavily encrusted with minerals.  Now I can just grab the tank every time he&#x27;s home and give it a good cleaning so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it when he&#x27;s on the road.</li>
    <li> This is a great upgrade for the original unit.  It is easy to keep clean and healthy!  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how much it bothered me that my standard issue water tub couldn&#x27;t be taken apart and cleaned.  A tub that could be opened for cleaning was such a simple thing to engineer, and crucial to a good night&#x27;s sleep.  Yet when I bought my ResMed CPAP I was told that a cleanable tub wasn&#x27;t available -- I would have to buy a replacement tub every time the standard tub became intolerable.  Not to worry, I was told, Medicare paid for regular replacements.  Oh, you (like me) are not on Medicare, and you have to pay for your own consumables?  Well, it&#x27;s not that expensive, they said . . .  !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanable water tub is the same size and essentially the same structure as the standard tub. Like the standard tub this unit holds about 3 night&#x27;s supply of (distilled) water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the standard tub, this cleanable tub comes apart in three sections: bottom tank, clear top, and square plastic locking &#x27;ring&#x27; that connects the top and bottom sections.  Once separated, cleaning in a sink is quick and easy.  Or, if you prefer, put it in the upper rack of your dishwasher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not owned this tub long enough to know how long it will last or whether it has unique defects that show up over time, but if it continues to perform as it has the first few months, I&#x27;ll rebuy in future.</li>
    <li> After I took it apart to clean it I had a very hard time getting it back together.  Had to go to a neighbor who had the strength to clip it back together.  Works well, however.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and so easy to clean.  Algae does grow when you use distilled water.  The tank must be cleaned.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean and use.  Being able to take this apart for cleaning when needed is a great benefit.  This cleanable water tub should be the one included with the S9 when you purchase it.  Most of the other reviews has said the same thing so maybe ResMed will listen.  But then again since they can make more money by not having this as the OEM item, why should they?  Bottom line here is that if you have an S9 CPAP, this is an add on you should get.</li>
    <li> I love that I can take the cover off and clean it. The price was right as well. love it.</li>
    <li> I love this water tub. The original tub that came with my machine was almost impossible to open, which made cleaning it exceptionally difficult. This one opens easy with tabs that lock it shut. It is even dishwasher safe! I wish this had been the stock water tub that came with my machine. I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought an extra one to rotate out with monthly cleanings. Works perfect. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The cleanable aspects of this H5i Cleanable Water Tub form my VPAP machine make is ideal for me. Great price and delivery, too.</li>
    <li> I got tired of NOT being able to CLEAN OUT my old Water Tub that came with my CPAP Machine. Found this, Bought this and works great.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this. One of the things I didn&#x27;t like about the old water reservoir in my ResMed S9 was that I couldn&#x27;t open the reservoir to clean it. This new model comes apart in three pieces so I can clean the entire reservoir without any trouble. I wish I had gotten this sooner.</li>
    <li> It fits perfectly with my machine and I like that I can clean it.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to clean.  Would purchase another.  Worked in my machine perfectly.</li>
    <li> No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
    <li> Far superior to the stock tank that came with my ResMed CPAP, which could not be opened to be cleaned.  This one makes cleaning the tank a snap.</li>
    <li> Good price for quality product. My only complaint is slow delivery.  But it came safely without damage so I give four stars.</li>
    <li> This tub is much more robust than the standard washable tub that comes packed with the H5i humidifier. The metal portion of the tub is made using a heavier gauge aluminum than the standard tub. It comes with the top, bottom and a center piece of plastic that the depth gauge is mounted to. The depth gauge is removable for cleaning if necessary. Use distilled water in the tub and you wont have problems with mineral/scale build up in the tub.</li>
    <li> This one is much nicer than the one that originally came with the machine, easier to take apart and easier to see how much water is in the tub.</li>
    <li> This is far better better than the stock ResMed water tub, because it can be taken apart for thorough cleaning and disinfection. (The stock sealed tank is impossible to fully clean or disinfect.) You can even put it in the dishwasher. On the other hand, the aluminum part does get discolored by the dishwasher detergent, and the aluminum appears to be more prone to corrosion. (Minus one star for those)</li>
    <li> Very good upgrade to the old style, but can be difficult to reassemble if the plastic collar slides down.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. This makes is so easy to clean, which I now do every two days. The last tub I had was the one that came with the machine and it was terrible. The tub was sealed so basically all you could do to clean it was swirl water along with soap (or some other cleaning liquid) to get it clean or force it apart. However, it was really difficult to force it apart and put it back together again. Sometimes it felt like it would break. In the end, I became lax about taking the tub apart because it was so difficult that I got some sort of strange growth in the tub that I didn&#x27;t even notice! It was disgusting. With this version, it is simplicity itself to take apart the tub and clean it, so I do it much more often. The metal portion of the tub seems much sturdier than the standard version and I can physically scrub out the whole thing. I think it&#x27;s great! This should come standard with the machine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Replaces the old style ResMed H5i &amp;#34;water bucket&amp;#34;.  This one features a better seal, and more importantly, an easy to read water level yellow tab.  It is very reasonably priced and well below what the manufacturer&#x27;s price is through a medical outlet.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I have no dishwasher and I still can clean the water chamber.  It is easy to take apart to clean.</li>
    <li> That old water tub does wear out.  This dishwasher safe model is a great improvement.  They should have thought of it the first time.  It would have saved a lot of headache.</li>
    <li> Should have ordered this the day I got a ResMed machine.  MUCH MUCH better than that germ-trap they ship with the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this cleanable, it is easier to handle, and the &amp;#34;fill line&amp;#34; mark is much easier to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trash your original and get one of these. Now.</li>
    <li> I wish I knew about this years ago when I first got my cpap machine. Easier to clean than the standard issue tub that comes with the H5i unit.</li>
    <li> The ResMed Water Tub is exactly what it is supposed to be.  It is taken apart easily and can be put in the dishwasher, or washed by hand.  My only concern is how long the flaps that secure the top to the bottom will last.</li>
    <li> Now, I can open the tub completely without having to manually try to maneuver a brush around trying to get all the scale of the metal pan!</li>
    <li> So far, this product has been great!  Easy to clean and get dry. So much better for infection control.&lt;br /&gt;And it fits perfectly in the S9 machine.</li>
    <li> No more worry about bacteria, and easy to clean and assemble. seems like a quality item. I am pleased that someone had the good sense to design this so it can be disassembled for sanitizing. bravo!</li>
    <li> I have only had the old water tub and it was so hard to clean.  This makes it so easy and now I feel that I&#x27;m getting it clean since it can be opened.  With my old one I was always worried that no matter how I tried I couldn&#x27;t really get it clean all the way.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes using my cpap much easier. I hated trying to clean the tub that came with my machine but cleaning this is a breeze!</li>
    <li> Picked up the ResMed H5i Cleanable Water Tub as an extra in case the plastic tab comes off picked it up at a lower cost then with the maker of the tub.</li>
    <li> When i got my ResMed S9 Elite w/H5i, i got the non-breakdown-able version of this tub.  They want you to replace the tub every 6 months.  I figured out how to breakdown the old version for years until i stumbled upon this version on Amazon. I have to say, why?  WHY wouldn&#x27;t you have made this the standard tub to come with the humidifier?!?  (I&#x27;ve heard from others that have got a S9 unit with humidity option say it comes with this tub now.)  This is an easy to clean unit, it&#x27;s dis-assembles and re-assembles very well, and seams to be very study in construction.</li>
    <li> When I first got a cPap machine it came with a one-piece water tub and I never felt like I was getting it good and clean by just swishing soapy water around in it. I love being able to take this apart and clean it piece by piece.</li>
    <li> Original replacement parts. Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> I finally have a tank for my plap  that I can easily clean.This is a vast improvement over the original tank.</li>
    <li> This is quality! much more durable that the tub that came with my machine.</li>
    <li> Replaced my husband&#x27;s original tub with this one.  It&#x27;s so much easier to keep clean!</li>
    <li> exactly as other unit purchased for much more money.</li>
    <li> Love it because I can wash the 3 pieces separately and don&#x27;t see gunk in between the outer clear piece and metal piece (which is why I trashed the one that came with the CPAP machine).  This makes me feel better about putting my nasal pillows up my nose/nostrils.  Before I trashed my old 1, I took it apart and couldn&#x27;t get it to fit together anymore.  This 1 reassembles in like 2 minutes or less (have washed it 3 times so far and I know when I get used to it, it&#x27;ll be much quicker).  Like the old 1, make sure it can air dry completely before you use it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Much easier to clean then my old tank.</li>
    <li> Had a regular none opening water tub originally, this is rugged, works great and is easy to clean:) Well recommended!</li>
    <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t expect it to work. It fit nicely into my machine and it&#x27;s better than original tub. Because you can clean inside. I would suggest anyone who has one piece tub to change.</li>
    <li> Anyone that has a standard humidifier unit will agree, this is what is needed.  You can actually take apart and clean tis unit rather than just dry it out.  No more lime scale, no more left over residue from previous days.  The price is right if you enjoy being able to know that your humidifier is clean.</li>
    <li> lost my old tank, had to get a new one. this one worked perfectly.</li>
