<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I normally use Visine Tears Dry Eye Relief, but Blink brand was suggested by my optometrist instead. For me, Blink brand is more irritating than soothing or relieving. I gave them a try for several days, and I use drops at least 3 times per day. The unpleasantness never got any better. Each application made my sight very blurry, and I had to blink incessently to ease the irritation. I&#x27;ve since gone back to Visine and my eyes feel soothed again.</li>
    <li> Blink Tears was recommended to me by my optometrist for itchy and sometimes dry eyes, but, I don&#x27;t quite need a prescription for something stronger and/or thicker yet.  I highly recommend and I do have sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do for my dry eyes.  It is much cheaper to order online than go to the drug store.</li>
    <li> I had IntraLase LASIK about a month ago, once my prescription eye drops ran out (I was on Zylet and Lotemax)these were the first drops my Dr. recommended to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is they seem to pack a pretty big drop no matter what size you buy, so I usually buy the biggest bottle for the cheapest price I can and pour it into smaller eye drop containers (easier for travel too!). Something about the standard BLINK bottle that causes way more then I need in 1 drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these even if you haven&#x27;t had LASIK, they are just that good.</li>
    <li> Really helps dryness in the eyes with no harsh chemicals. Will recommend it to friends and order it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who wears contact lenses.  She says it works great when her eyes dry up.  Easy to use.  My only gripe is that you seem to have to use quite a bit of pressure to get one drop out.&lt;br /&gt;My only comparison though is to visine:)</li>
    <li> I got this because I am a big fan of blink for contacts.  Unfortunately, this formula makes my eyes feel like there is something gritty in them.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist has been telling me I have chronic dry eyes for years. I&#x27;ve tried several eye drops and they didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time he specifically told me to use these drops. After using it I now know what he was talking about all those years. My eyes have never felt this great. I always thought it was normal for eyes to itch and/or feel scratchy after being up a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been told you have dry eyes give these a shot. You might not know how much unnecessary discomfort you&#x27;ve endured over the years.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my ophthalmologist because it contains hyaluronic acid, a natural lubricant. Don&#x27;t know of any other eye drops that have this ingredient. Have been using these regularly for my dry eyes and have no reason to switch. Knocked down 1 star since the drops sometimes come out on their own without pressure when  you get close to finishing the bottle.</li>
    <li> They are very effective.</li>
    <li> After having lasik surgery, my doctor recommended Refresh Optive Sensitive drops because they are preservative free.  After a couple weeks, though, he said I could switch to regular artificial tears.  Keeping with the brand he had recommended for the other drops, I stuck with Refresh, using the Optive Advanced.  Only after using them for about a day, they felt heavy on my eyes, and caused blurring when instilled.  After doing some research online, I decided to try the blink tears.  These made a huge difference!  Not only are they very soothing, but they don&#x27;t cause any blurring or feel heavy in my eyes.  I would highly recommend these for users with post-lasik dryness, or dryness in general.</li>
    <li> I always use Visine for contacts, but I got these drops to sample from my eye doctor last time I went. Of course, they get paid for this. I have only used them a couple of times because I like Visine anyway. To my surprise, I eventually noticed in the label that these are a product of China. Eye drops...from China?? This is terrible. Had I known this, I never would have put these in my eyes. It says very little of a company that goes all the way to China to save money in making a product that goes into our eyes. China is not precisely known for making good products or caring for quality. They use dangerous ingredients even in toys. They kill their own babies with poisonous formula. Why would they care about our eyes? This is unacceptable. I would never spend money in this company. Visine drops are made in Belgium, and other Bausch + Lomb products are made in the U.S.A. Contact lenses are made here or in Ireland or other European countries. Who goes to China to make eye drops? Terrible.</li>
    <li> I wear contacts and my optometrist recommended these. They work well when I have no contacts in, but when I have contacts in then my vision is a bit blurry for about a minute or two after putting these in. I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the store brand re-wetting drops. However, the product I received is what I expected and it was delivered quickly so if you like these, I would recommend the seller.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended them and I use them faithfully.  I don.t know what more to say about them.  great help.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product. Recommended by the ophthalmologist that performed my LASIK surgery three years ago, and have been using this particular brand&#x27;s product ever since.  I use this every morning to refresh my eyes after a night&#x27;s sleep, and during the wee-hours of the evening when my eyes become tired and dry.  No irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion; always purchase directly from Amazon whenever possible to insure the product is fresh (hasn&#x27;t expired) and that it&#x27;s legitimate (the real deal).  Otherwise, research the seller&#x27;s rating before buying.  Amazon&#x27;s return-policy is great... other sellers, not so much.</li>
    <li> Wets your eyes perfectly, check expiration dates carefully, some of the bottles I received had a 2 year expiration, some had only 6 months. No stinging like with other eye drops. Not for use with contact lenses, because it&#x27;ll gunk up the lens and make it blurry to see through. Without lenses, this is the best eye drop money can buy.</li>
    <li> It is very good to my eyes. My eyes feel comfortable after I use it. I like it very much</li>
    <li> These drops work fine, and I like them.  I bought them as a recommendation from my ophthalmologist.  Then I found out the active ingredient and the amount of that ingredient is the same as that found in the much less expensive Systane eye drops.</li>
    <li> i had lasik done and the dr recommended these, they work great!</li>
    <li> This product if very helpful, especially if the eyes get irrated. I would recommend this product to anyone. It really works.</li>
    <li> These eye drops are wonderful. They have helped my dry and allergies immensely.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone who has problems with dry eye related to allergies.</li>
    <li> I use these drops daily.  I have had my cateracts removed, dual lens implanted plus Lasix Surgery.  All were successful except I now have very dry eyes.  These were recommended by my ophamologist and I use several times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Very effective.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased by the Blink Tears product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His eyes are sensitive and vision in one eye compromised.  Blink Tears is gentle and gives relief and lubrication to his dry eyes.</li>
    <li> As advertised and works no complaints for that price as well.  Came on time no complaints with this product at all.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the product.  I have dry eyes and they usally are very red in the morning.  I used this product and there wasn&#x27;t much improvement.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I use with preservatives in it for lubricating my eyes.  I had Lasik last year and have dry eye when I wake up every morning and this product fixes the problem with a few drops.</li>
    <li> these natural tears eyedrops are the best.  I have several eye issues (dry eyes, glaucome, implants) and my opthamologist recommends this type of eye drops.  They are very expensive in Wal-Mart and K-Mart but very reasonable when you compare prices on Amazon.</li>
    <li> These Blink Tears Lubricating Eye Drops feel wonderfully soothing to my eyes.  I wear contact lenses, and sometimes they get very dry and uncomfortable.  These drops are perfect for me because they aren&#x27;t the thicker, almost gel-like drops that obscure my vision for a number of minutes.  These simply sooth my eyes as well as moisten them.  My vision is improved after these seem to wash away dirt &amp; dust.  I like that they are not the kind of eye drops that &amp;#34;get the red out&amp;#34;, which are irritating.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> These blink tears have helped with dry eye and are easy to carry in a purse, or leave in your bathroom.  They have helped relieve mild dry eye</li>
    <li> My eyes get dry whenever I am on the computer. It&#x27;s my daily job. This has helped me greatly. It lubricates and gives lots of moisture to my eyes. Great product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time and I love them. They work immediately and feel very comfortable .</li>
    <li> Blink Tears for mild to moderate dry eyes are really good.  My eye doctor recommended them for my dry eyes and I wear contacts and I find the drops very comfortable and very soothing.  Thank you.</li>
