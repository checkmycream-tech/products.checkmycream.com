<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I intensely disliked the smell of this product.  It smelled old and rancid. I generally like coconut and the fact that it was organic was appealing. I tried it several times but the smell on my skin was so bad that I threw it away.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The smell is overwhelming. It was a struggle to try to wash it off. I put the lotion right in the trash. You are warned.....</li>
    <li> This lotion is so light. It is perfect for me to keep my hands moisturized and be able to handle my baby without worry of exposing him to chemicals.</li>
    <li> Best lotion out there.  No chemicals and my hands improved so much after using this.  I have been using this a few years now.  All the other chemical lotions either burn or do not do anything.  I like that this is natural, smells good and works!  Really cannot believe some of the bad reviews about this product.  Only loion I use.</li>
    <li> this is not the first time I am using this product...I love the fact that is natural and it smells wonderful...also all other lotions from the same line are great...it is very thick but is being absorbed quickly...</li>
    <li> Love this product! Would have given 5 stars but the tube that the cream came in was broken, the nipple of the top lid had broken iff and the cream tube does not stay closed, it is a shame since I wanted to take this with me everywhere since it smells so yummy!</li>
    <li> Lovely stuff.  Smells like heaven and is wonderful on your skin.</li>
    <li> Great lotion but kind of strong smelling for me.</li>
    <li> Others don&#x27;t like the way it smells but I like it. They think it smells like pop corn. That&#x27;s cool too</li>
    <li> The lotion was a nice texture and feel, but it did not smell like coconuts and I could not tolerate the scent. I really wanted to like this product and I am hesitant to try others as I am not sure of the scent.</li>
    <li> I like the all natural lotion but it is really potent and smells really strong.  If it weren&#x27;t for such a strong odor I would have given it 5 stars because it is really good lotion.  I only bought this because I am pregnant and I had read to use coconut lotion in the morning and a body butter in the evening.  Wherever I had read this, knew what they were talking about, I haven&#x27;t gotten one stretch mark and my skin looks the healthiest it every has.</li>
    <li> ahh!! what a joy this is to put on my body! is is non-greasy yet very rich. My skin stays soft and supple throughout the day.  it also has a wonderful scent which is NOT sweetly cloying like so many others.  I highly endorse this moisturizer for those seeking to aid dry skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so nice! It has a strong scent that lasts, but it&#x27;s not overpowering, and it&#x27;s thick and rich. It works well at moisturizing typical dry skin. You&#x27;ll need to apply it a couple of times to relieve severely dry skin, but you&#x27;ll enjoy the scent in the meantime. Because it&#x27;s coconut, it smells somewhat like coconut macaroon cookies.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thickly whipped hand creme! The smell is intoxicatingly coconut without being too overboard and the creme is rich and wonderful on my hands. Yum!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best lotion I have ever used!!!  Smells AMAZING and feels just as wonderful!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is really a good lotion, thick &amp; creamy, left my skin feeling very soft and not greasy.  Loved that part of it, however, the smell is more like toasted or burnt almonds.  I didn&#x27;t care for the smell but thought I&#x27;d tolerate it since I liked everything else about it.  That was until my husband said he didn&#x27;t like the smell either.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I loved the ingredients, BUT let me just say the smell is awful. If you want to walk around smelling like burnt hair or overdone popcorn than this would be for you. My husband and friends all complain about the way I smell. I want to love this product, because the quality of the lotion is nice! I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing this because the smell ruins the product for me. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m so in love with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the ingredient list is all natural, no toxic additives.  Yay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the smell is like buttery coconut - soooo yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaks in easily, no greasy feel.  Leaves my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, finally I&#x27;ve found my holy grail body cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- UPDATE 1/18/14 ----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ve been using this daily, and I can tell you from experience - it&#x27;s not actually moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it, and a few hours later my hands still feel dry and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad to say I need to go find a better lotion again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s great to finally have a product that doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals and synthetic ingredients that most, if not all, name brand products have. This lotion is very creamy and smooth, but make sure to thoroughly massage it in, because I feel that it just sits on top of the skin if you don&#x27;t. To me, the smell is nothing like coconut, maybe more of a flavored coffee or toffee scent, which I really like. I will definitely be purchasing more products from 100% Pure!</li>
    <li> I really dig this stuff. Makes my skin feel delicious without nasty chemicals.  I even bought a tube for my kids to use!  We all love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am more than just satisfied with this product.  This winter my skin was so dry.  I normally use coconut oil but it was just not doing it.  A friend recommend this and it did the job beautifully.  This is my winter all natural cream.  My skin is back to normal again, 100% Pure is no joke!!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the coffee/chocolate version, but still wonderful! It&#x27;s so great to have all natural products like this on the market!</li>
    <li> I love this company and every product I have tried is great.  This particular lotion smells absolutely yummy and does a wonderful job of moisturizing my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this body cream. I use it on my hands before bed and my body after a shower. It&#x27;s not too heavy and the smell is amazing. I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of the harmful, toxic chemicals in many beauty products today.</li>
    <li> I love coconut lotion.  but to warn you, this is a very thick lotion.  if you need something thinner don&#x27;t get this.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! I&#x27;ve been looking for a lotion to replace my non-organic brands and not only does it give me long lasting moisture it smells so good I&#x27;m tempted to eat it! :)  Your skin is the largest organ on your body and it draws in what you put on it.  Because of the purity of this lotion, I feel like I&#x27;m feeding a healthy meal to my body.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This is the most natural fragrance, and with such a fluffy, non greasy texture!  I give it out as a gift all the time.  Everyone absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> Wow, its smells so goood, but I don&#x27;t really smell coconut.  Let&#x27;s start with the packaging, I like that its simple, plastic container with a flip top.  As I opened it, the consistency is creamy but not too thick like those heavy creams (which I do not enjoy), its a rich lotion.  I also like that its not greasy.  The smell, the initial smell, to me, it smelled like the popcorn butter from the movie theater!!  LOL.  Then as I applied it, I could smell cocoa butter.  Its a sweet smell, but not too much coconut.  I usually use Trader Joe&#x27;s Coconut Body Butter, that smells like coconut.  Overall, I am pleased with my purchase, its like a sweet treat after a long day of work! :)</li>
    <li> 100 percent pure has the best lotions. They have the best ingredients and feel thick and creamy but absorb well. They make your skin glow.</li>
    <li> I tell you, I love this cream.  I use it daily.  I even smear some on my face after a shower.  It is very soothing to the senses.  Also moisterizes and softens.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I love 100 percent pure products so I figured I&#x27;d try this out. I just opened this today and I LOVE it! I usually get the honey almond (my favorite) but the coconut one has taken first place. It smells like you can eat it! It&#x27;s a bit thicker than lotion and not watery but not as thick as a body butter. I used it several hours ago and the fragrance is still there. No harsh ingredients and parabens, even better. Thank you 100 percent pure! This is officially my favorite body cream. :)</li>
    <li> GREAT AS USUAL. VERY FAIR PRICE SINCE 100% Pure is now charging $19 but you get free shipping also.. I love to go on Amazon and see the deals that are out there.. Great product, smells delicious and all pure....</li>
    <li> not as good as I had hoped.  the scent is a little stale too...</li>
    <li> But the smell is overpowering.  It seems like I&#x27;m inside a coconut macaroon.  STRONG and sweet cooked coconut smell.  Lingering.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s actually coconut plus cocoa seed butter that I&#x27;m smelling.  I think maybe the combination is what makes it so strong.  Not terrible, but for me... too much!&lt;br /&gt;AND!, I have to add that it&#x27;s been 20 minutes since I put it on, and my hands feel very dry again.  Odd.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m wishing I hadn&#x27;t bought this lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for decent lotion. I sometimes use coconut oil though it can be a pain in the winter and it can be greasy if you use too much. I purchased this after reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the consistency. My guess is the coconut oil in it makes it so thick. I started taking the cap off when I use it, was too much of a pain to squeeze it through the tiny hole. It absorbs well and is non-greasy. I like the smell though I can see how it might be much for some. Seems like a little goes a long way, has been quite a while since I purchased and I still have a lot left!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the better lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> So creamy and rich, not greasy or oily at all, my skin just drinks it up. But what is best is the scent!  The coconut one is the best, smells like coconut macaroons and lasts all day.  Plus no scary chemicals.</li>
    <li> Smells very sweet like honey mainly. No one in my family likes the smell.</li>
    <li> Best thing out there for your skin. I love it. It helped my complection. And it made my my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Love all of 100% Pure products ! This creme is great for my legs and feet just not super crazy about the smell- it&#x27;s not really coconut smelling but more like cookies or something.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product it said it is 100% Pure Organic and all the ingredients on the back of the product doesn&#x27;t read organic and the description on Amazon said it&#x27;s a lotion and when I get it the front of the tube said it&#x27;s a cream so that&#x27;s  very misleading.</li>
    <li> All it needs is a spoon, and you&#x27;re good to go!  Seriously, this is an amazing smelling coconut lotion.  Just close your eyes,and you&#x27;re in the tropics! And it really works well to soften dry skin.  I apply it before going to bed, and after closing my eyes, I imagine myself lounging in a hammock on a palm-shaded beach somewhere in the South Pacific.  Sweet dreams...</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it makes my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have found I can use every single 100% pure product I have tried with success.  Not one of them has caused a reaction... and understand that 99% of products I try cause a rash/hives/a break out of some sort.  That includes other all natural or sensitive skin products (like Aveeno, Tarte, Clinique, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% pure is my new go to company for skin care, make-up, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product specifically smells nice (a little strong, I have since ordered the White Peach and other scents which I like better, this one is almost like a candle type smell) and is a great body butter - thick but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling goopy.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion from a big makeup store and I really love it. It is thick and creamy and glides on easily. I love that after a few hours, you can still feel the moisture embedded in your skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy but when you touch your skin it still feels soft and moisturized. The only negative is the smell. If you are expecting a pina colada/tropical smell, you aren&#x27;t going to get that. The smell is hard to describe. It isn&#x27;t unpleasant but it smells almost nutty and sometimes like buttery popcorn? I can&#x27;t really detect a coconut odor in it. I still love the lotion but wanted to give everyone a heads up on the smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice, and I use it as hand cream.  Lovely smell, too.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, yummy smell,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best body cream ever. The smell to die for and it feels great on your skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to the standard supermarket brands that are laden with toxic chemicals.  I love the smell of this cream - like a sweet coconut.  It&#x27;s thicker than regular supermarket lotions, but goes on really easily, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I will buy this cream again.</li>
    <li> It smells a little strong, but it has excellent moisturizing properties. I would buy it again, but it&#x27;s a little pricey for the size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using that I love it.</li>
    <li> I hate it because I did not receive the lotion!  Instead I received some caffiene eye creme.  Does not make one happy when they are expecting lotion.</li>
    <li> A little on the greasy side, but not bad.  Doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing odor like some body creams.</li>
    <li> It doesnt really smell like coconut. It smells more like a custard bakery bread. It is more like an oily feel than a lotion feel. I dont really like it and I kinda regret buying it for the price I payed. At least its all natural though!</li>
    <li> Smells divine! Super creamy lotion, and smells like a tropical coconut summer dream. Seems go to a long way, and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I was given this product as a gift just recently. It is without a doubt the best product of this kind I have ever used, no matter the price. I am now about 3/4 of the way to empty on this first bottle and was very pleased to see it was available on Amazon. The product was delivered as promised and no doubt I will order again in just a month or so.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy a nutty coconut fragrence you will love the smell of this lotion.  It&#x27;s 100% natural, 100% vegan and made in the USA.  I gave it 4 stars because it is a little on the greasy side.</li>
    <li> I work in a high school media center, and my desk is near the front door. When I use this lotion, it&#x27;s amazing how many students and adults comment on how pleasant the aroma is. It seems that everyone smells something different: bread, cookies, coconut, etc. One of my coworkers asked me for the product&#x27;s website, and she ordered the product for herself. Seriously, I never bother to recommend any thing. Who has the time? But this product feels good, smells great, and gets lots of praise. Worth trying :)</li>
    <li> This lotion for one, smells spectacular. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the typical \\&quot;suntan lotion smell.\\&quot; It&#x27;s much deeper and rich. I also love the consistency. Not too thick and not too creamy. The best part is that it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals! Love their products.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s gluten free and organic, however the smell is way too strong for some. I smell like a thanksgiving candle. I love that smell, but some don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave reviews, but this lotion (really a cream) is worthy!  I&#x27;ve long been looking for a natural, organic cream that smells amazing and leaves a soft, not greasy, feel.  The smell reminds me of the sunscreen of my youth... hawaiian luxury, minus all the nasty chemicals.  It is truly a coconut smell, so be sure you&#x27;re a fan before ordering.  I love it.  I swear those tiny, annoying little bumps on my upper arms already look better.  It is a very thick cream, so I can see going through it a little more quickly than my wallet would prefer... but at this point it really seems worth it.  I have very sensitive skin and absolutely everything makes me break out, get itchy, etc.  This cream was a dream, no problems whatsoever.  Just my personal experience and opinions, but I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Keeps your hands well hydrated and smooth.  Smells great, just like coconuts of course, however the scent tends to fade away quicker than I like.  Normally I could care less about scented hand lotions, but being deployed, this reminds me of the beach from home.</li>
    <li> This cream is worth every penny! I am overjoyed to finally find a COMPLETELY pure body cream, and organic too! So wonderful! I wish I could give this product more than five stars! It says lotion, but it is thick and rich like a cream and smells fantastic; very natural coconut smell. I love it! I have sensitive skin, made even more sensitive by my overuse of popular heavily perfumed body products.  I have worked for years for a national beauty store that specializes in creams and body products.  Recently their products started giving my skin blisters and blemishes.  My skin felt dry and was peeling about thirty minutes after using their \\&quot;best\\&quot; cream; which after reading, is loaded with multiple types of parabens and chemicals-yuk. Why are we still putting these nasty things all over our bodies, when parabens have been linked directly to an increase in breast cancers? I wish I had changed my habits years ago! If you don&#x27;t want to make a change for yourself, then make it for your little ones.  My little ones now use only this lotion and a pure body wash.  My daughter used to complain that her skin was itchy after using other brands of body lotions (the ones loaded with chemicals).  After using this lotion, there have been NO complaints! She even loves the scent, and she is super picky.  All in all a FANTASTIC product!</li>
    <li> This lotion is really nice, it however does NOT have that typical lotion residue that I believe some people are just used to and expect because of the nasty petroleum based products we have all become accustom to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion leaves a different feel on you after applied, a natural normal feel, it also last long.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick, smells great,  I use it on my legs, (it keeps my tattoo nice and shiny and bright) my feet, and my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a facial moisturizer.  I love this.  I hope it is always in stock.</li>
    <li> gorgeous scent.. not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like, but still worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> This lotion is AMAZING!!! It is thick &amp; creamy, and seems to soak right into my skin...no greasy feeling. The coconut smell is DELICIOUS, very light...almost like white chocolate?! It&#x27;s great, my husband always compliments me when I wear it! :)</li>
    <li> OMG!!&#x27; I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! IT&#x27;S AMAZING!!! I just got it today and I feel the difference and it also smells amazing!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great lotion; keeps my skin moist far longer than a lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lotions that I&#x27;ve tried.  I have cut out sugar and vegetable oils from my diet and didn&#x27;t want to have those in my beauty products. This is the only company that I could find that didn&#x27;t include those two in them.  So excited! Thank you 100% Pure!&lt;br /&gt;(I love the smell, but my husband does think it&#x27;s too strong - so one of the other lotions/washes might be better for those with a sensitive nose.)</li>
    <li> I have very scaly elbows and have tried just about everything on them and only gotten temporary healing.  This not only works great but the coconut scent is lovely.  Try it and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree.</li>
    <li> I bought three creams from 100 Pure (Apple, Coconut, and Vanilla). I loved how they were rich yet didn&#x27;t leave residue on my skin. They were all thick, opaque, and creamy. I read the ingredients and they are all real and high quality. No synthetic fillers or any sort. Unlike other organic products out there, these lotion don&#x27;t smell stale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smelled like fresh coffee more than coconut, but I don&#x27;t mind. It had a hint of coconut.</li>
    <li> 100% Pure has the best skin products on the market. I recommend the body lotions and facial creams, I feel like I &#x27;m doing my skin a favor everytime I put it on,</li>
    <li> the texture of the lotion is creamy and nice, but the smell is more &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; then anything.  I wanted it to smell of coconut lotion! Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like the smell &amp; it keeps my hands soft &amp; keeps them from cracking from the dryness here in AZ</li>
    <li> The scent is delicious!  Great, thick body cream which dries and absorbs into my skin super quickly.</li>
    <li> I already use the hand cream, and I love the smell of it so I bought the body cream. This not only smells great, but when I use it and then wash my hands, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use more lotion.</li>
    <li> Smell isn&#x27;t overpowering or too sweet like it can be with coconut lotions.  Absorbs well.  Natural.  I used it during pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 2 years now, it smells great, no chemicals and keeps my skin smooth and hydrated..</li>
    <li> Love this lotion in combination with the coconut  body scrub. My skin feels fantastic</li>
    <li> I give this product high marks for being all natural and having organic ingredients. I think body lotion gets so absorbed into the body, that you should think of it like food -- it needs to be pretty free of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize well. After 5 minutes, my hands feel dry again. I don&#x27;t really understand why (and I&#x27;ve had a similar experience with one other natural lotion, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s), but it&#x27;s very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also 100% Pure&#x27;s scents are mostly way too strong for me. Distracting for me and anyone near me.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the container isn&#x27;t recyclable and it&#x27;s hard to get the last bit out of it.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion for three reasons, 1. It smells really good 2. It&#x27;s not like a lot of lotions that you have to put globs of it on for it to actually take effect. 3. It has a strong nice scent which lasts pretty much all day. I actually have really sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t really use a lot of the scented lotions so I&#x27;ll continue to buy this</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion because I am trying to only use products that do not contain harmful or potentially harmful &amp;#34;mystery&amp;#34; chemicals like paraben or sulfides. It&#x27;s made of organic matter from plants and I can identify nearly every ingredient on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with the lotion; other organic lotions I tried didn&#x27;t seem to have the same moisturizing power that chemically laced lotions do.  This lotion comes out of the tube light and fluffy and has decent coverage when applied. My skin is rather dry and I have keratosis pilaris (those little bumps on the upper arms/thighs); this lotion stands up to that.  And my favorite part - NO RESIDUE! No greasiness and seems to absorb quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this particular blend is a bit more on the &amp;#34;burnt almond&amp;#34; side but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant. The smell is not overpowering like some perfumed lotions, and is more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, after years of trying every brand, from cheap stuff to Aveno to Body Shop and boutique farmers market creations, this is my favorite lotion I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Amazing wonderful smell! Little bit goes long way which is nice</li>
    <li> This is my fav of the 100% Pure lotions. The scent is addicting. Smells like coconut cream pie to me and my husband loves the scent too. This has become a standby  and always have one close by.</li>
    <li> I really like this body lotion. It moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. Biggest thing is it never irritates my eczema on hand and arm!&lt;br /&gt;I complaint about its smell at first, but after a few months of use, I&#x27;m getting to like it. It&#x27;s sweet creamy vanilla-y coconut. I&#x27;m changing to 5 star now!</li>
    <li> The product absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I gave it two starts since it seems to work like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is so off-putting that it nearly makes me feel nauseated. I think it perhaps it smells like young coconut, which isn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It smells like sugar and almonds, but not in a good way. I don&#x27;t like it at all. Unfortunately, I probably can&#x27;t return it because I opened it and tried it out (not sure how else I would be able to assess it). My fault for buying lotion online, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re looking for a lotion that truly smells like coconut, avoid this product. I&#x27;m throwing mine away - it really smells that icky to me.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that the product was all natural. However it does not smell like coconut as much as it does toasted coconut. The toasted scent does dissipate after a while but it wasn&#x27;t the pure coconut scent I was hoping for. The lotion is absorbed into the skin without being oily.</li>
    <li> The lotion goes on smooth. It feels really nice. The scent is Coconut, but more like a toasted or coffee scented Coconut.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this lotion to my friends. The scent is wonderful but not overpowering. The lotion is long lasting and moisturizes the driest skin. I love that it is organic!</li>
    <li> We use this along with the body scrub and love it.  We liked it so much we ordered another one.  We keep one in the kitchen and one in the bathroom.  It&#x27;s the best there is for smoothing and moisturizing the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I add it to a big bottle of Alba lotion and it makes the Alba smell of vanilla and coconut. Heavenly!!</li>
    <li> This lotions is nice and thick and smells wonderful.  I purchased the coconut.  It is a mix between coconut, vanilla and a sugar cookie. It&#x27;s very pleasant the scent and seems to linger.  It goes on smooth and is very luxurious feeling. I would definately buy this again!</li>
    <li> My mom originally purchased this lotion for me at a local Ulta store.  But she lives several thousand miles away, so when I ran out, I really wanted to replace it with the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is made with all good products.  It works very well on my dry skin, and it smells Fantastic.  My husband loves it, says it makes him think of cookies in the oven.  My kids love it too, and want me to share with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and will probably even try other scents and products by Pure in the future.</li>
    <li> Works great making your skin feel smooth, and the fragrance is just delightful!</li>
