    <li> I was using an obagi toner that was probably doing the job. BUT it didn&#x27;t FEEL like it was doing anything on my skin. Tried this instead and wow! I can feel the tingle and burn (in a good way). I&#x27;m convinced this is better.</li>
    <li> Really helps with adult hormonal acne.</li>
    <li> A great cleanser to help reduce pore size as well as a quick exfoliation. Stings after shaving, but that let&#x27;s me know its working!</li>
    <li> Great service and a wonderful product at less than my Hair Salon/Spa charges for the same thing.</li>
    <li> I had bad breakouts on my forehead for some reason by after I started using Skinceuticals  products they have stopped!!

    <li> I have no idea how this product has so many good reviews. I have combination skin, and I really didn&#x27;t like it (and I had really hoped that I would). It smells like rubbing alcohol and just seems to be really harsh on my skin. While it didn&#x27;t necessarily dry me out, it didn&#x27;t really do anything at all to improve my skin.

Be kind to your skin and skip this toner!</li>
    <li> The best toner on the market for oily, acne prone skin. I use it with the LHA cleanser and my skin has never looked better. Cleared up my skin almost overnight. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have mature oily skin and have problems finding products that don&#x27;t break my face out. I use this and the cleanser. Works great for me. Would recommend</li>
    <li> I have used the Skinceuticals LHA Solution Skin Toner for Oily Skin for several years now.  I do not have oily skin now but am plagued with formation of precancerous places due to sun damage, which the LHA Solution in combination with the Skinceuticals LHA Gel Cleanser does help control.  This toner does not dry out my skin but seems to make my skin feel balanced and moisturized.  I use at night after cleansing and before applying my night-time moisturizer, and I use it after cleansing my face, and before I use my day-time moisturizer and apply makeup.  I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Using it along with retinol cream.  Definitely exfoliates.  I have sensitive skin, so don&#x27;t use every day.  Seems to help with acne.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It works and I love that I can spray my back with it so help with those zits, all those hard to reach and large areas to cover</li>
    <li> Shinceuticals has truly changed my skin! I have very problematic skin and the face wash, toner and blemish serum have changed it. just very satisfied with the products.</li>
    <li> A toner that is absolutely non-drying but still keeps pores clear. Drastically reduces the number of clogged pores I experience--even in summer. It also helps my face absorb lotion more evenly!</li>
    <li> LHA cleanser and toner are the only products I use for my acne. I have tried just about everything in my lifetime and this was the first product that actually worked for me. I have used it for 4 years and unless they stop making it, will use for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner and face wash combo for about 3 years now; it seems pricy but you only need the size of a dime to do the work. I used to tan a lot (terrible, I know) so I had a ton of sun damage. After about a year and a half my sun damage was gone and almost all of my freckles were as well! I always get compliments on my skin and this is all I use. I also buy their clay mask as well, This seller delivered everything quickly and nothing is ever broken or leaking. I hope they will continue to carry this product forever.</li>
    <li> The package arrived with no visible signs of damage. However, the product inside was damaged. The box was corroded. Upon further inspection, I noticed the security seal for the product had been removed and replaced. Therefore, the sticker did not &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; anymore. The product inside was not visibly leaking, but there was some type of dried crusty substance on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from this merchant before and suspected they were selling bogus Skinceutical, by filling the bottles with some other substance. In my haste, I inadvertantly ordered from them again. I don&#x27;t know what they are putting in these bottles, the last time the product was yellowish in color. I just threw it away. This time the product is clear, but whatever is in there has corroded the box and has left a nasty crusty substance on the bottle. I&#x27;m not throwing it away this time....I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product as part of my facial cleansing regimen.  This product is great at cleansing and preparing my face for the moisturizer that I use.  It also has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I use this religiously, and my skin has not felt better or looked better. It helps to eliminate, control, and prevent any of my break outs. I feel relief once I have applied it. I trust it.</li>
    <li> Always been a favorite toner of mine for my oily aging skin.</li>
    <li> Product works very well for people with oily and acne prone skin. Number 1 choice for my skin.</li>
