### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I found that putting it on for &gt;10 minutes would over-dry, so somewhere &amp;lt;10 minutes will be the best for using this mask.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Got this on sale at a health-food store and was not that impressed.</li>
      <li>I bought it on a whim and am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not the best clay mask out</li>

      <li>It had a nice consistency when applied, and the smell was very pleasant.</li>
      <li>This mask is amazing!</li>
      <li>What a pleasant surprise.  </li>
      <li>100% vegeterian and no animal testing should make you feel good about using this line.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Until then, however, I will try to buy ones with as much good stuff in them as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works the best by adding some warm water in order to lay it on easily.</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant smell as well and a cool feel</li>
      <li>absolutely love this mask!</li>
      <li>Works 10x better!</li>
      <li>The price was great and shipping was very fast!!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go :)</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply and remove, which is not always the case with masks.</li>
      <li>There is no need to pay more.</li>
      <li>The one that stands out the most to me is the aloe.</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin feels and looks after using this product</li>
      <li>Leaves your face feeling wonderful, shrinks pores, deep cleans, even lessens the look of my crows feet.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this mask.</li>
      <li>It worked okay, but the smell is too purfumey</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It makes me want to try more Alba face products.</li>
      <li>Aside from the smell, the mask is OK -</li>
      <li>but it is pretty good.</li>
      <li>That mask is nice, but it&#x27;s not as good as the old formulation, which is what I was trying to get by ordering it online.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light and clean scent from the ingredients that are in it.</li>
      <li>On a side note, I picked up a great book on making your own beauty products at home which is really informative and well written called \\&quot;organic body care recipes: 175 homemade herbal formulas for glowing skin and a vibrant self\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>BTW: Amazon carries all of the ALBA products at great prices and you&#x27;ll never have to miss-out on these lush and cheaply extravagant gifts for your face...</li>
      <li>The texture is silky, creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean, So so far so good</li>
      <li>My face is smooth, clean, problem free after 2 uses.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would really like to try making my own masks one of these days, especially with many ingredients that would remind me of nice formulations that are available for purchase.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t smell natural to me - surprising from Alba (I was expecting a mildly scented mask).  </li>
      <li>Most ALBA products are 99-100% pure and organic.</li>
      <li>and it comes right to your home!</li>
      <li>My skin was bright red and swollen with in mins of applying the product.</li>
      <li>Also, I love its gentle fragrance.</li>
      <li>instantly the scent was very overwhelming, and it did not fade over time.</li>
      <li>For us sensitive skinned people, it is mainly the perfume that causes a severe reaction, both on the skin, and respiratory wise.</li>
      <li>Worth a try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You only have to leave it on for five minutes, which I also liked.</li>
      <li>They generally reduce oil and leave skin with with a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>Only use this mask 2 or 3 (at the most) times per week for maximum benefits.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>I love how you only need to leave it on for 5 mins.</li>
      <li>my skin felt very clean, not too dry - it did a decent job, but again, the fragrance was so strong that I wasn&#x27;t really into it.</li>
      <li>I just keep it on for about five minutes at this point, and it is really helping make my severe acne more moderate.</li>
      <li>As most of us know, it is hard to find the time to do a good facial.</li>
      <li>I had been using Arbonne products for a long time and paying top dollar.</li>
      <li>This thick mask washes very clean and leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>skin seemed absolutely fine for the next 12 hours</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It really does draw out impurities.</li>
      <li>and I have noticed it keeps me blemish free and evens out my tone, giving me enough confidence to skip foundation altogether.</li>
      <li>Great facial mask as seen on Dr. OZ and better price than CVS can&#x27;t go wrong with this....</li>
      <li>This product was better than I expected it to be.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>This product is in the Advanced line along with the tropical Botanical line that is made with lots of lush fruit extracts and enzymes that act naturally to cleanse and detoxify.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m upset that the listing is not representative of the actual product that was sent to me, and even more upset that the old product, the &amp;#34;deep sea mask&amp;#34; has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!!!</li>
      <li>I left it on for five minutes, and gently washed my face off with cool water and a washcloth.</li>
      <li>but this was apparently the calm before the storm-</li>
      <li>So first off, I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This is not a life changer, but I have relatively decent skin</li>
      <li>I washed my face with a hot washcloth first to steam open my pores.</li>
      <li>I am using all Abla face and skin care products and ditching the high prices products.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>No negative results.</li>
      <li>Was a bit hesitant to buy after reading others reviews but still gave it a try, just to say that I have normal to oily skin.</li>
      <li>Overall, it wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
      <li>and my skin feels very clean, but without the harsh feeling of \\&quot;iciness\\&quot; in the pores that some skincare products create.</li>
      <li>The item that was shipped to me is their new &amp;#34;Even Advanced&amp;#34; mask.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought cheaper masks from drugstores in the past that work better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually get such good results with low cost skin care products.</li>
      <li>Following the mask, I used a facial moisturizer, and about an hour later, my skin is feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>My face looked glowing and clear.</li>
      <li>It makes your face clear &amp; evens out your skin tone.</li>
      <li>This natural clay mask works well, and can be used while doing almost anything at home.</li>
      <li>This product did not contain anything that I was allergic to and had natural ingredients in it, which is why I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>A highly-prized clay from China that gently draws out the oils and impurities found deeply imbedded into the pores.</li>
      <li>No rash occurred even though I have seasonal sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>an adult, I try to stay away from chemical laden products--especially parabens and propylene glycol which can cause me irritation and rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, this product is not for you.</li>
      <li>I can no longer find that product (an old formulation) in the stores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This thick mask washes very clean and leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.  It has a very pleasant smell as well and a cool feel so it is quite relaxing to have on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying that I have extremely sensitive skin so this product probably doesn&#x27;t affect other users as such.&lt;br /&gt;However, the product SEEMED gentle enough after I read the back, so I decided to be brave.&lt;br /&gt;It stung when I put it on but just figured that&#x27;s what it was supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;My skin seemed absolutely fine for the next 12 hours but this was apparently the calm before the storm- my skin broke out in a stiff, red, bumpy, and slightly itchy poison-oak-like rash (particularly on the right side of of my face).&lt;br /&gt;Also, my eyes became a bit swollen which often happens to me when my face reacts to something.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!!!</li>
    <li> I love Alba products!! I have just recently tried there botanica line. This face mask is great. It smells great. It left my skin feeling tight and soft. Also, a little goes a long way with this product. I know this tube will last me awhile. I will definately buy this again and from this seller!!  The price was great and shipping was very fast!!</li>
    <li> This mask is great. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot for it to work (I use it rather religiously and estimate it will last me at least 2 months). I wouldn&#x27;t say you&#x27;ll see results instantly, but you get a noticeable difference in your complexion within 24 hours. This is not a life changer, but I have relatively decent skin and I have noticed it keeps me blemish free and evens out my tone, giving me enough confidence to skip foundation altogether. It&#x27;s a nifty little product without an obnoxious smell that gets the job done. Go Alba!</li>
    <li> I used to use masks once a week since I was a teen. They generally reduce oil and leave skin with with a healthy glow. As a teen I used Freeman ones and max factors blue mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, I try to stay away from chemical laden products--especially parabens and propylene glycol which can cause me irritation and rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really like to try making my own masks one of these days, especially with many ingredients that would remind me of nice formulations that are available for purchase. On a side note, I picked up a great book on making your own beauty products at home which is really informative and well written called \\&quot;organic body care recipes: 175 homemade herbal formulas for glowing skin and a vibrant self\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then, however, I will try to buy ones with as much good stuff in them as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the mask....some reviewers seem to have experienced some reactions to the product. This made me a bit cautious as my skin does react to stuff. Please keep in mind that even the finest essential oil can cause a reaction on some.  And masks, can over dry if left on too long (according to the mask) which would cause the skin to produce more oil, and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used this mask, I did not wash my face with my normal cleanser first, as I wanted to eliminate the possibility of ingredients reacting with each other on my face. I left it on for five minutes, and gently washed my face off with cool water and a washcloth. I noticed a faint redness and a cool tingling sensation after removal. My face looked glowing and clear. The very very slight redness disappeared after about five minutes. My face looked and felt great. Also, the mask smelled really great.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing! I have a curse of big pores, blackheads, and acne. This stuff is a miracle to my skin! I leave it on longer than 5 min like it says and put it on BEFORE washing my face. Works 10x better! My face is smooth, clean, problem free after 2 uses. I use about once a month since I have oily skin. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;m not one for facial masks and I actually bought this item by mistake (meant to order Alba&#x27;s facial scrub) but it doesn&#x27;t get dry or tight and it doesn&#x27;t cause redness like some products do for me.  I use it once or twice a month and my skin feels very clean, but without the harsh feeling of \\&quot;iciness\\&quot; in the pores that some skincare products create.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because of the picture- I can no longer find that product (an old formulation) in the stores. However, the item pictured is not the item that was shipped to me. The item that was shipped to me is their new &amp;#34;Even Advanced&amp;#34; mask. That mask is nice, but it&#x27;s not as good as the old formulation, which is what I was trying to get by ordering it online. I&#x27;m upset that the listing is not representative of the actual product that was sent to me, and even more upset that the old product, the &amp;#34;deep sea mask&amp;#34; has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin at all. I now just use this when I&#x27;m feeling spa-like. I put this mask on and some cucumber slices and I&#x27;m good to go :)</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this mask. I washed my face with a hot washcloth first to steam open my pores. Then, I spread on the mask. It had a nice consistency when applied, and the smell was very pleasant. It&#x27;s a very light and clean scent from the ingredients that are in it. The one that stands out the most to me is the aloe. I have sensitive dry skin, and a lot of allergies. This product did not contain anything that I was allergic to and had natural ingredients in it, which is why I decided to try it. Plus, the price was great. You only have to leave it on for five minutes, which I also liked. It gave me time to heat some water and make a cup of tea. After I rinsed it off, my skin did feel smoother, and the mask did not dry out my skin as some others have. Following the mask, I used a facial moisturizer, and about an hour later, my skin is feeling very soft and smooth. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Given that it&#x27;s a recommendation from a friend but some people found it irritating, I left the mask on for 5 minutes at the first try. No rash occurred even though I have seasonal sensitive skin. The second time I left it on for about 10 minutes, and still didn&#x27;t get irritation. I guess everyone reacts to different irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans pores and blackhead as most Kaolin clay base mask does. This mask doesn&#x27;t over-dry like other clay mask, which might be due to some plant oil and shea butter in it. However, that could be why it takes longer to rinse than other clay masks and I still feel oily on hands after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is cheaper than a lot of similar masks (such as Bosica Detoxifying Mask) and works as well. Worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;UPDATE after &gt;10 uses&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this mask! I found that putting it on for &gt;10 minutes would over-dry, so somewhere &amp;lt;10 minutes will be the best for using this mask. I almost use it everyday on T-zone, and nothing irritating. Blackheads are almost all gone after using it regularly. Whenever I feel I&#x27;m going to have a breakout or the blackheads are coming back, using this helps. Also, I love its gentle fragrance. It works the best by adding some warm water in order to lay it on easily. It&#x27;s in a really big tube too, so it will last a while before it runs out.</li>
    <li> Great product that truly purifies the skin and makes it smoother. Immediate, noticeable results.  Very nice scent, too!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The scent of this mud mask is so overpowering, it&#x27;s a major detractor to the product.  It reeks of men&#x27;s cologne - doesn&#x27;t smell natural to me - surprising from Alba (I was expecting a mildly scented mask).  Not exactly a spa-like experience.  Aside from the smell, the mask is OK - my skin felt very clean, not too dry - it did a decent job, but again, the fragrance was so strong that I wasn&#x27;t really into it.</li>
    <li> Was a bit hesitant to buy after reading others reviews but still gave it a try, just to say that I have normal to oily skin. I am not sure of the &#x27;Sea Facial Effect&#x27; since i didn&#x27;t feel any.&lt;br /&gt;I just used it like twice till now..and it gave me such dirty red bumps all over my forehead!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin has gotten very dry and there&#x27;s redness all over.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any real changes, but so far it hasn&#x27;t harmed my skin, so that&#x27;s a plus. One issue I have with it is that it smells like men&#x27;s after shave. Not very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and was looking for a clay mask to sop up the oil. This mask didn&#x27;t leave me with a deep cleaned feeling. Also I think it may have caused a breakout. Overall, it wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
    <li> I had been using Arbonne products for a long time and paying top dollar. I had no idea you could get all natural products like this at such a low cost. I am using all Abla face and skin care products and ditching the high prices products. There is no need to pay more.</li>
    <li> This product was better than I expected it to be. The results are great. I don&#x27;t usually get such good results with low cost skin care products. I bought it on a whim and am very happy with it. I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. The texture is silky, creamy and smooth. It is very easy to apply and remove, which is not always the case with masks. It leaves my skin very soft, very clean feeling and it also seems to break down my dead skin. It is slightly drying, so I like to use a moisturizer after, but I expected that. Overall it&#x27;s a great product. It makes me want to try more Alba face products.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant and have always had hormonally based acne - now it is worse than usual. I am trying to avoid harsh chemicals and nothing was working for me. I started to use this mask a few times a week and now, am using it every day. I use Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel with rose water afterwards, a touch of moisturizer, and sometimes tea tree oil on bad spots. I was initially afraid to use this every day - I have always been told and read that you should only do masks infrequently - but it is the only thing that helps me right now. No negative results. I just keep it on for about five minutes at this point, and it is really helping make my severe acne more moderate. I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in a month.</li>
    <li> This is a really great mask to incorporate into your skin care regimen. I use it 1x a week after washing my face, applying toner, &amp; steaming my face for 10 mins. I love how you only need to leave it on for 5 mins. It makes your face clear &amp; evens out your skin tone. This is a must have if you want to take care of your pores!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have been using Alba facial wash and astrigent as facial care, and I can have somewhat of an oily face. I&#x27;ve noticed that other people say that this is too drying. The directions specify to only leave it on for five minutes. I have not noticed any overdrying after using the mask for that time period. This really helped to firm and clear my face above and beyond the existing products which were already working. I even sometimes just completely smear a pimple that pops up when I&#x27;m lax about my facial care and it helps to get rid of it. My only complaint is that it can be a little stiff to get out of the tube, like most of these products.</li>
    <li> As most of us know, it is hard to find the time to do a good facial. This natural clay mask works well, and can be used while doing almost anything at home. Leaves your face feeling wonderful, shrinks pores, deep cleans, even lessens the look of my crows feet. Love it.</li>
    <li> I got this a few days ago, and have used it twice so far in combination with the Sea Mineral Cleansing Gel. I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in my skin. It has reduced the appearance of pores in my T-zone, I hardly see any blackheads, and my skin is less oily. I cannot attest to it&#x27;s effectiveness on dark spots, as that takes time, but after seeing the results so far, I&#x27;ve got hight hopes that this product will deliver.</li>
    <li> Got this on sale at a health-food store and was not that impressed. I&#x27;ve bought cheaper masks from drugstores in the past that work better. It&#x27;s okay, but not great.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels and looks after using this product</li>
    <li> The only problem I have been having with this product is I have been getting blemishes after I use it. Not many.</li>
    <li> This product states that it is Hypoallergenic when it is not. If you read the ingredients on the back, one of the ingredients in fragrance (perfume). For us sensitive skinned people, it is mainly the perfume that causes a severe reaction, both on the skin, and respiratory wise. I purchased this item thinking it was hypoallergenic like it said it was. instantly the scent was very overwhelming, and it did not fade over time. My skin was bright red and swollen with in mins of applying the product. If you have sensitive skin, this product is not for you.</li>
    <li> Ok. So first off, I have sensitive skin so I  can&#x27;t use just anything.  I&#x27;ve not been using this for too long but it is pretty good. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean, So so far so good</li>
    <li> Great facial mask as seen on Dr. OZ and better price than CVS can&#x27;t go wrong with this....and it comes right to your home!</li>
    <li> I accidentally got this thinking it was the facial scrub. What a pleasant surprise.  It really does draw out impurities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently begun using the ALBA line of facial products because of their natural and botanical ingredients which include: marine and plant-based anti-oxidants and beneficial vitamins such as A,C,E,B5. All of these ingredients act to hydrate and keep moisture locked-into the skin. There is also glycerin which draws in moisture from the the air (humectant). We all know the benefits of aloe. Damaging free-radicals are minimized and vitamin C helps to prevent and reverse future harm to your delicate face. Also listed is kaolin. A highly-prized clay from China that gently draws out the oils and impurities found deeply imbedded into the pores. ALBA products are noncomedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores) and hypoallergenic... Most ALBA products are 99-100% pure and organic. This product is in the Advanced line along with the tropical Botanical line that is made with lots of lush fruit extracts and enzymes that act naturally to cleanse and detoxify. 100% vegeterian and no animal testing should make you feel good about using this line. That aside: it does as it says and I&#x27;m hooked on these products for my organic days... I do alternate on occasion. Only use this mask 2 or 3 (at the most) times per week for maximum benefits. Use less if skin irritation occurs. Let your face get used to the product... I just cleansed in between reviewing this and am on my way to unlock the wonders of this mask... BTW: Amazon carries all of the ALBA products at great prices and you&#x27;ll never have to miss-out on these lush and cheaply extravagant gifts for your face... My friends have already starting using ALBA after they&#x27;ve seen what it&#x27;s done for me...</li>
    <li> It worked okay, but the smell is too purfumey and it&#x27;s not the best clay mask out there.&lt;br /&gt;See my reviews of natural masks here, at Green Lather:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
