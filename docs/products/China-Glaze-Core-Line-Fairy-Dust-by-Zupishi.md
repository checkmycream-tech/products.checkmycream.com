<li> Glitter isn&#x27;t just for little girls.</li>
<li> Need to buy more of this asap because for some terrible reason it is discontinued....which makes me sad.</li>
<li> Fairy Dust is a bunch of holographic glitter in a clear base.  </li>
<li> and it wasn&#x27;t broken or anything.  </li>
<li> A very subtle sparkle.  </li>

    <li> this is a great topper just love it.looks great on top any color and it is easy remove.a silver shimmer just very pry pretty.</li>
    <li> i thought it was clear but it is a blue unsatisfied</li>
    <li> Perfect, works as an accent to any color.</li>
    <li> This review won&#x27;t show up as an Amazon Verified Purchase because I actually ordered China Glaze \\&quot;Stem Unit Delta\\&quot; and the seller \\&quot;XPRESSURSELF\\&quot; sent this instead.  I was initially put off because they didn&#x27;t even bother to inform me of the substitution.  It&#x27;s not acceptable because I could have already owned \\&quot;Fairy Dust\\&quot; - but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I decided to keep this and try it out (but I will never order from XPRESSURSELF again).  Happily I can say I love this glitter top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little goopy, buy it leveled itself and dried very nice and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One light coat was all that was needed to achieve a healthy coating of glitter over the top of my dark purple polish (China Glaze \\&quot;Shape Shifter\\&quot; with a top coat).  A second coat would be far too much glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to find a seller who will really send me \\&quot;Stem Unit Delta\\&quot; - because I still want the stainless steel colored glitter.  I&#x27;m just happy to say this is great too.  I wouldn&#x27;t even want to attempt a return with this seller</li>

    <li> I have purchased this to add to my China Glaze collection and I love it. The polish is nice and thick, so it lays down smooth and only needs a coat or 2 to be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap has a nice size and feel so it is easy to control.</li>

    <li> FAIRY. DUST. EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much sparkle.  Came to me days before I was expecting it.</li>
    <li> This us so sparkly. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this color because it is perfect for every occasion and I can wear it in a professional setting and not feel like a small child because it&#x27;s too glittery. It is a beautiful subtle sparkle.</li>

Fairy Dust can be worn on it&#x27;s own and be just as pretty as can be or try it as a top coat to add sparkle to other polishes. That is what I love most about Fairy Dust is it&#x27;s versatility.  Glitter isn&#x27;t just for little girls. I wear this to the office regularly.</li>
    <li> It has great sparkle and seems to ba making my polish last a little longer.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it but it&#x27;s definitely not new bottles as they say. Only 90% full</li>
    <li> Very elegant, simple look to this polish. Not too opaque, though,but I wish it were. Nonetheless, this is a nice glitter polish to improve the look of your nails, and goes with almost any base coat!&lt;br /&gt;Heres a tip: put a base coat of any bright color (red, purple, green, blue, etc). Get a sponge and put some of this polish on the sponge and dab it on the tips of your nails first halfway, then a quarter way up. The end effect will be gorgeous!</li>
