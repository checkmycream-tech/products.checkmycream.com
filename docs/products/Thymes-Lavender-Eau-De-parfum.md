      <li>Aside from that, it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have received many compliments on this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>and I love lavendar.  </li>
      <li>even better when layered with the lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say save your money and do not take the chance on this - as you will not be able to return it.</li>
      <li>I already know she&#x27;ll love it.</li>

      <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this one for many years and simply love it.</li>
      <li>Again, this is my all time favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>and I will probably order more.</li>
      <li>I like lavender cologne to have more of a crisp/clean scent.</li>
      <li>It has a touch of woody scent along with the lavendar and it makes it so much more interesting.  </li>
      <li>I have tried most every Lavender fragrance that has been made, and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really pleasant and very lavendery:)</li>
      <li>They love the light scent, which isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>The lavendar cologne by Thymes is a light essence I find refreshing.  </li>
      <li>A true winner!</li>
      <li>Light and clean aroma of lavender without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a philosophy pure and amazing grace user.</li>
      <li>I also have the body wash and really enjoy that as well.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy wearing it every day.  </li>
      <li>I bought this item locally and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Light and fresh.</li>
      <li>the smell is wonderful and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Although interestingly enough, the body wash is amazing, but something is truly a mis with this cologne.</li>
      <li>A little spritz makes for a lovely feeling and a nice, nice smell all day long!</li>
      <li>Lavender fragrances are tricky, so if you&#x27;re looking for just the right essense</li>
      <li>Light floral scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm those with sensitive noses!</li>
      <li>I really like the light scent of this cologne--smells fresh, like lavender, and not heavy and too-too floral.</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t used it before you might want to see if you can sample it in a store first because you cannot return it.</li>
      <li>with fast shipping from the Seller!</li>
      <li>FAST delivery, thank you!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I am well aware of what &#x27;real&#x27; lavender smells like and this product does not even come close.</li>
      <li>the dry down leaves a soft, wonderful smell.</li>
      <li>really don&#x27;t like overbearing scents.</li>
      <li>It smells like generic cologne you get free at a cheep motel.</li>
      <li>Pretty heavy and overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, not much like actual lavender.</li>
      <li>saw this in a high end store that carries off the beaten path brands.</li>
      <li>I wanted the more traditional lavender scent like Yardley&#x27;s and this definitely is not a true lavender scent in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>pretty!!&lt;br /&gt;I had no trouble finding it online or with my order process.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cologne for years and love its subtle lavender fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not strong and overpowering like other products and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it.</li>
      <li>The scent is a little more complicated than simply pure lavendar.  </li>

    <li> I love this cologne! It smells so pretty!!&lt;br /&gt;I had no trouble finding it online or with my order process.</li>
    <li> I  read all the reviews about how great this stuff smelled so I orderd it.  I was not thrilled with this scent and could not return it. I wanted the more traditional lavender scent like Yardley&#x27;s and this definitely is not a true lavender scent in my opinion.  If you haven&#x27;t used it before you might want to see if you can sample it in a store first because you cannot return it.</li>
    <li> I really like the light scent of this cologne--smells fresh, like lavender, and not heavy and too-too floral. I only wish it lasted longer after you put it on. It would be nice if Thymes also offered it as a perfume, something with a bit more staying-power. Aside from that, it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this specific scent, from this specific manufacturer.  Her last bottle had been broken by her cat - I got this one in anticipation of her upcoming birthday.  FAST delivery, thank you!  I already know she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> What a delightful fragrance that is both soothing and comforting.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender should smell...</li>
    <li> A bit too (no offense) grandmotherly for me.  Pretty heavy and overwhelming.  Lavender fragrances are tricky, so if you&#x27;re looking for just the right essense I&#x27;d go elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Lavender at all.  In fact has a unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> I like it. use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> the smell is wonderful and long lasting. saw this in a high end store that carries off the beaten path brands. loved the smell and couldn&#x27;t get it off my mind. the dry down leaves a soft, wonderful smell. even better when layered with the lotion. would purchase again. also plan to purchase the eucalyptus scent. I&#x27;m a philosophy pure and amazing grace user. really don&#x27;t like overbearing scents.</li>
    <li> Full scented lavender, exceptional!</li>
    <li> The lavendar cologne by Thymes is a light essence I find refreshing.  I enjoy wearing it every day.  I will order again through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Again, this is my all time favorite fragrance. Light and clean aroma of lavender without being overwhelming. Definitely one to buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years and was happy to find it on Amazon when I was no longer able to find it in stores.  Light floral scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm those with sensitive noses!</li>
    <li> I gave this cologne to both of my daughters for Christmas! They love the light scent, which isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. Plus, it lasts all day long! A true winner!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, not much like actual lavender. Smells like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Thymes.  A little spritz makes for a lovely feeling and a nice, nice smell all day long!</li>
    <li> I have tried most every Lavender fragrance that has been made, and this is one of my favorites.  It has a touch of woody scent along with the lavendar and it makes it so much more interesting.  It does last for several hours and I will probably order more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for many years and simply love it. They mix a little something else w/ the lavender but it&#x27;s really pleasant and very lavendery:)</li>
    <li> I bought this item locally and loved it.  The problem was, they didn&#x27;t restock it, so I had to re-supply myself over the Internet.  Of all the lavender scents I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one the best.  The scent is a little more complicated than simply pure lavendar.  Very elegant and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I am well aware of what &#x27;real&#x27; lavender smells like and this product does not even come close. It was a horribly overpowering unnatural scent.

I&#x27;d say save your money and do not take the chance on this - as you will not be able to return it.</li>
    <li> Lavender is not represented in this scent.  Although interestingly enough, the body wash is amazing, but something is truly a mis with this cologne. It smells off like it has been on the shelf too long and the scents are not melding properly.</li>
    <li> Great scent.. with fast shipping from the Seller!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells sooooo good, I love the fresh lavender scent!  I also have the body wash and really enjoy that as well.  This product arrived quickly and in great condition too.</li>
    <li> Love Thymes lavender fragrance. Used to buy them at the Marine Corp Exchange, but they no longer have it. Was very happy to find this online.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like lavender. It smells like generic cologne you get free at a cheep motel. It can not be returned. Do NOT order!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents. Light and fresh.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne that does not give me a headache and I love lavendar.  I have received many compliments on this fragrance.  Also thrilled I can get this through Amazon, so easy and affordable!</li>
    <li> Have used for years, then my store stopped selling it. So glad I found it. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, and has staying power.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for years and love its subtle lavender fragrance.  It&#x27;s not strong and overpowering like other products and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I thought I would like it based on the reviews but I have to say that it&#x27;s too sweet-smelling for me. I like lavender cologne to have more of a crisp/clean scent.</li>
