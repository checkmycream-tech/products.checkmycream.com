      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work onmy fine hair as well as a mousse</li>

      <li>My hair finally looks healthy again.</li>
      <li>does a great job on thin hair</li>
      <li>I use about one ounce of the product after each shampoo, so you can&#x27;t play games and skimp on how much you spray each time.  </li>
      <li>Great for thin hair or thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;It is a product that I can&#x27;t find in the store, so I was very hapy to find at amazon and in the number that I need it.</li>
      <li>Everything else leaves my fine hair flat and lifeless...</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t run a comb through it, and it held fairly well with the exception of the other evening when it was very damp out (lots of dew at an outside reception).</li>
      <li>I receive this product in the time expected and it is in a very good,nice original box, thanks, ileana&lt;</li>
      <li>so your hair isn&#x27;t super flat.  </li>
      <li>It is not nearly as good as the original product for fine hair.</li>
      <li>Not sure why I can&#x27;t buy this product in stores anymore, but I love it.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it keeps my hair, bangs especially from hanging limp.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and thin.</li>
      <li>I am a 50 year old woman with fine blonde hair (maybe a little gray) and it made my hair very flat.  </li>
      <li>sprayed it on right out of the shower, air dried my hair.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes because I like other Pantene products</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used expensive products and this works as good if not better.  </li>
<li> It makes your hair stiffer and less natural</li>
<li> Before Pantene DISCONTINUED the FINE Hair Style Root Lifter Spray Hair Gel with this sorry excuse for a replacement, I used it religiously.</li>
<li> This product helps me to be able to keep my hair from appearing limp and thin.</li>
<li> I bought a bottle to try, it lasted so long</li>
<li> I have long hair</li>
<li> This is the ONLY stuff that works on my hair and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
<li> so I can put it in a loose pony tail to dry overnight.  </li>
<li> Wash your hair AT NIGHT, then spray the product all over your scalp when your hair is still wet or damp, massage the product all over your head with fingertips, let hair AIR DRY overnight.</li>
<li> Enough volume without looking or feeling odd.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores, and got a little nervous</li>
<li> I am quite old and my hair has been thinning lately.</li>
<li> Does any company think what it&#x27;s like to hold a product container with wet hands and squirt all around the head?  </li>
<li> Then I tried Pantene&#x27;s Curl Enhancer in the pink bottle.</li>
<li> Letting your hair dry overnight while on a pillow keeps it lofty because it is drying without gravity pulling it down.</li>
<li> I spent a hundred dollars looking for a replacement with other brands.</li>
<li> I have tried other things</li>
<li> Since they constantly change every product they make, and have products made for all types of hair, I find it hard to believe they didn&#x27;t change the formula at all.  </li>
<li> /&gt;While it does not hold like hair spray, it does keep the roots slightly \\&quot;boosted\\&quot;</li>
<li> Try this but only if you are serious about wanting thicker and fuller hair - follow all the steps and don&#x27;t try to take any shortcuts.  </li>
<li> I have had trouble finding this product in the stores anymore</li>
<li> not to mention dried out and breaking.  </li>
<li> My hair didn&#x27;t get so stiff</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product did not work well at all for me; in fact it did the opposite.  </li>
<li> This spray gel is hard to find now that I think Pantene has discontinued it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had wicked bad luck with mouse and similar hair gimmicks.  </li>
<li> Washing in the morning means blow - drying, which in turn means flat, straight, boring, ugly hair for me that is hard to style and looks thin, even with product sprayed into it.  </li>
<li> I tried three  similar products, all three were very disappointing compared to this product.  </li>
<li> My hair got so thin postpartum</li>
<li> I am too tired to shampoo at night, I pay the price.  </li>
<li> Not happy with this product at all.  </li>
<li> At 70 my hair is very thin and has no body.  </li>
<li> Everything was bad.</li>
<li> This product is awful for my hair.</li>

    <li> Not sure why I can&#x27;t buy this product in stores anymore, but I love it.  Everything else leaves my fine hair flat and lifeless... not to mention dried out and breaking.  I&#x27;ve had wicked bad luck with mouse and similar hair gimmicks.  So glad I found this here. My hair finally looks healthy again.</li>
    <li> Decided to buy this because I have used the prior spray gel that was made and which I cannot find anymore.  This product is great, smells great, is not sticky at all and gives volume.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> very good for fine hair</li>
    <li> Does any company think what it&#x27;s like to hold a product container with wet hands and squirt all around the head?  Plus this stuff is sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> My hair got so thin postpartum, it was super stringy, I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with it. I tried this at my mother in law&#x27;s house and I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. sprayed it on right out of the shower, air dried my hair. Thicker looking, more body, more texture. Can&#x27;t believe a \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; brand works so well!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me because I have fine hair.  It is a great root boost without being sticky.  My hair didn&#x27;t get so stiff I couldn&#x27;t run a comb through it, and it held fairly well with the exception of the other evening when it was very damp out (lots of dew at an outside reception). My hair still had its style; just a wee bit flatter. It would have been a lot flatter without the root boost. Nothing would have kept the style short of spray glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does not hold like hair spray, it does keep the roots slightly \\&quot;boosted\\&quot; so your hair isn&#x27;t super flat.  This product does what it says it will do - and smells good, to boot!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I am quite old and my hair has been thinning lately. This product helps me to be able to keep my hair from appearing limp and thin. I can certainly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Then one day when I went to purchase more I found there was&lt;br /&gt;no more on the shelves of the stores I had purchased it from...  That was when I went to Amazon&lt;br /&gt;and was delighted to find it there...Thank you Amazon.... You save my hairdo.....</li>
    <li> This spray gel is hard to find now that I think Pantene has discontinued it. Thank you for keeping some in stock.</li>
    <li> I love this product, does real good at lifting up your hair roots , gives hair more volumn, I will order again, Its hard to find this in the Stores around here</li>
    <li> I receive this product in the time expected and it is in a very good,nice original box, thanks, ileana&lt;br /&gt;It is a product that I can&#x27;t find in the store, so I was very hapy to find at amazon and in the number that I need it.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product at all.  It did not do what it is stated to do, no lift at the root whats so ever.</li>
    <li> Before Pantene DISCONTINUED the FINE Hair Style Root Lifter Spray Hair Gel with this sorry excuse for a replacement, I used it religiously. It was the only thing that worked. Then Pantene decided to &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; the formula. Nice going. I spent a hundred dollars looking for a replacement with other brands. Everything was bad. Nothing worked. Then I tried Pantene&#x27;s Curl Enhancer in the pink bottle. It is a good substitute. So I bought 10 bottles to give me time to find something else if I need to. You people who have been using this Root Lifter for Fine Hair, try the Curl Enhancer. It puffs up your hair!</li>
    <li> ordered for my wife she loves it</li>
    <li> It was not labeled as Fine Hair Style Root Lifter Spray Hair Gel,  but as Volume root lifting Spray Gel.  It makes your hair stiffer and less natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Pantene, they said the labeling was changed to include all hair types but it is the same formula.  Since they constantly change every product they make, and have products made for all types of hair, I find it hard to believe they didn&#x27;t change the formula at all.  It is not nearly as good as the original product for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love this lifter...This is the best product for lifting my fine, straight, short hair.  I bought a bottle to try, it lasted so long I can&#x27;t remember where I bought it, went to every place in town and can&#x27;t find it in stock on any store shelf.  I tried three  similar products, all three were very disappointing compared to this product.  I swim every day and wash my hair 3-5 times a week and use this product sparingly because it doesn&#x27;t take much to make my fine hair perfect to look at...thx for asking!</li>
    <li> At 70 my hair is very thin and has no body.  I have tried other things but this lifter is the best.  I have had trouble finding this product in the stores anymore so I order on line at Amazon.  It is really great even on dry hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and thin. This product along with the rest of the products in this line for fine hair makes my hair manage the way I like it to.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do my hair without this product!  Love this!</li>
    <li> Works but not my favorite</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised. Great product</li>
    <li> Try this but only if you are serious about wanting thicker and fuller hair - follow all the steps and don&#x27;t try to take any shortcuts.  Wash your hair AT NIGHT, then spray the product all over your scalp when your hair is still wet or damp, massage the product all over your head with fingertips, let hair AIR DRY overnight.

In the morning, just lightly comb and arrange your voluminous mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am too tired to shampoo at night, I pay the price.  Washing in the morning means blow - drying, which in turn means flat, straight, boring, ugly hair for me that is hard to style and looks thin, even with product sprayed into it.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so some tresses may not respond well to these suggestions but I wanted to share my tips, just in case some people out there might benefit.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive root lifter that doesn&#x27;t build  up our get sticky in your hair.  It stays light in your hair, and really gives you&#x27;re hair control and lift. I&#x27;ve used expensive products and this works as good if not better.  I have fine hair and it keeps my hair, bangs especially from hanging limp. I couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores, and got a little nervous so I tried amazon, where I seem to be able to find everything I need.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, and this gel spray is the only product so far that has been able to maintain lift in my hair throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see why Target no longer carries....it&#x27;s a great product and inexpensive.  So I purchase on Amazon and stock up.  Great for thin hair or thinning hair.  Enough volume without looking or feeling odd.</li>
    <li> Formulas has changed. It used to be perfect for my type of hair: fine, curly, no volume. It volumized and took the frizz away. This product is awful for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY stuff that works on my hair and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.  So happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work onmy fine hair as well as a mousse</li>
    <li> I have used Salon Products,but I always come back to Pantene.My hair gets better results and I always get compliments on it!</li>
    <li> Product perfect and shipped very quickly!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> does a great job on thin hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product did not work well at all for me; in fact it did the opposite.  I am a 50 year old woman with fine blonde hair (maybe a little gray) and it made my hair very flat.  I had high hopes because I like other Pantene products but this 3 pack is heading for the garbage.</li>
