### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>BEST volumizing product on the market!!  </li>
      <li>Best mousse I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Jonathan mousse, Pantene, Kerastase, and others, but this gives the best results.</li>
      <li>It is excellent.</li>
      <li>A wonderful product that I bought on a cruise ship about eight years ago.  </li>
      <li>Dosn&#x27;t give any weight to my hair and it gives a great volume!!!Plus</li>
      <li>Happily found it here on Amazon again.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Smells great too.</li>
      <li>This had great reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d splurge and try it out.  </li>
      <li>Salon used this on my hair &amp; it looked great</li>
      <li>Along with Bedhead&#x27;s Mega Whip, this gives me good hair.</li>
      <li>and I also loved the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I love the mousse!</li>
      <li>This mousse smells amazing, but I would not say it provides a lot of volume.  </li>
      <li>With the $40 price, I thought I would get spectacular results.</li>
      <li>Gives your hair a nice lift</li>
      <li>Product was a good price and came very quickly.</li>
      <li>took off one star for the very strong smell.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>I have very fine shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a while and love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
      <li>I get better results from drugstore bought mousses by L&#x27;Oreal (who makes Keratase) at a fraction of the price.  </li>
      <li>so I take the top section and clip it to my crown then take about a kiwi-sized (NOT orange sized like the directions</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted more volume.  </li>
      <li>I am writing this review primary for those of you who might be wondering what is the difference between the mousse and the liquid volumactive spray as I was wondering myself which one was the better and added the most volume, so I eventually purchased both.</li>
      <li>and I loved them so much that I purchased them for use at home.  </li>
      <li>so I ordered some,  use it only on top for volume &amp; shine &amp; it looks great.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>work, transforming my limp fine hair to looking beautiful!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not yet sure it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a light mousse.  </li>
      <li>so everything is bouncy and light.     </li>
      <li>IT IS REACH BUT LIGHT.</li>
      <li>Wish that Volumactive were still available, I&#x27;d buy it all up.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very economical.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite product!</li>
      <li>In this case a higher price doesn&#x27;t purchase a better product.  </li>
      <li>Boosts volume significantly 2-3</li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine hair, and Kerastase products work beautifully to provide volume and bounce without weighing the hair down or making it look \\&quot;frozen.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I love almost all Kerastase products and this is no exception, gives great volume without leaving your hair heavy.</li>
      <li>For those of you who wants a Varoom volume and control to your hair that lasts most all day choose the mousse.</li>
      <li>I have full hair, but I still like to add volume when I style it.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair full of body.</li>
      <li>Kerastase helps to create as close of a full body blow out as I get from my salon.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to smells and this one is very strong and perfume-like until your hair dries.</li>
      <li>I have been a long time user of Volumactive and have loved that product, finding it to be well worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>May be worth finding a cheaper alternative.</li>
      <li>I cost like 36 bucks but is totally worth</li>
      <li>I am now dependent, annoyingly, as it is a  great product that&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
      <li>Well, you don&#x27;t know how good you&#x27;ve got it until you&#x27;ve encountered the other stuff.</li>
      <li>I used the same techniques with other products and the result was always incredibly blah.     </li>
      <li>It took a while to figure out exactly how much to use without making my hair kind of sticky and over-producted but once I did, my hair is crazy soft, sleek, and perfectly pumped at the roots</li>
      <li>I have lots of hair, but it is baby fine and not a bit of natural wave.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, flat hair.</li>
      <li>First of all, there is no fragrance whatsoever</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and so sad that Kerastase has discontinued it.  </li>
      <li>But I kind of hoped I wouldn&#x27;t like it, because I&#x27;d really rather not spend that much money on hair products (especially since I already use their shampoo).  </li>
      <li>My wife is a loyal fan of this product and the price offered by Amazon is highly competitive.</li>
      <li>Love the product but the top is hard to get the product out.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately for my wallet, it works great, and there&#x27;s a huge difference in my hair&#x27;s volume between days I use it and days</li>
      <li>What I realize about Kerastase is that is leaves my hair feeling natural and clean, not sticky like the others.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I let my hair air dry and the top layer was fuzzy.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is incredible, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I love the fullness it gives to my hair, and the scent is light and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>So I brought it to my hairdresser who blew it dry and the top layer was still fuzzy and flyaway.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m actually spending less on a product that works longer and better than I would trying things out and having to purchase more often.</li>
      <li>Really like it.</li>
      <li>But it does not provide much volume.</li>
      <li>DO NOT APPLY TOO MUCH THOUGH.</li>
      <li>It works very well - even in this climate</li>
      <li>I normally really like Keratase products.  </li>
      <li>otherwise it is just way too much</li>
      <li>In experimenting with other mousse, I realize Keratase never created the fly aways that other brands to.</li>
      <li>I have chin-length fine hair that is single processed.</li>
      <li>Gives volume without stiffness with only a tablespoon size amount,  Hair looks even better the next day.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have found this works a little better than drug store brands</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin short hair, this product is amazing as it does not just add volume but conditions my hair as well.</li>
      <li>This product really makes your hair soft and I like the look I get.</li>
      <li>Love that it Volumnises without being overly heavy on the hair.</li>
      <li>When I moved away my new salon didn&#x27;t carry Kerastase and so I would buy the products online from Europe</li>
      <li>My hair looked thicker and very natural.</li>
      <li>My experience however is the opposite, that I don&#x27;t get any real volume effects from the new version.</li>
      <li>This product really does give me extra volume and my hair feels thicker when I use it.</li>
      <li>HAIR SOFT.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it is a bit pricy, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>but oh so soft.</li>
      <li>I use a little less than the recommended amount and am very pleased with the result.</li>
      <li>but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because the price is so high (I paid $31.99 for it at a local store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The new &#x27;improved&#x27; formula named Volumifique  has been formulated to be lighter than Volumactive, with the intent of providing greater volume for thin hair.  </li>
      <li>Then I un-clip the top section of my hair, use about half the amount of mousse as before and rub it through the remaining wet hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this is the only mousse that does not leave a sticky film on your hair or leaves it feeling heavy.  </li>
      <li>They are so much better than other salon products I have wasted my money</li>
      <li>Occasionally, I try something new, but always go back to Keratase.</li>
      <li>The dry air tends to leave hair straight and flat.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair &amp;#34;sticky or tacky&amp;#34;.  A wonderful product that I bought on a cruise ship about eight years ago.  Happily found it here on Amazon again.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This is a mousse that does what it promises!  It is hard to find as it sells out quickly.  The product was well packaged and arrived on time.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I  bought this at the salon at my stylist&#x27;s suggestion. My hair is very thick and becomes weighted down easily so I need volumizing products at the root. It took a while to figure out exactly how much to use without making my hair kind of sticky and over-producted but once I did, my hair is crazy soft, sleek, and perfectly pumped at the roots so everything is bouncy and light.     My hair is chin length so I take the top section and clip it to my crown then take about a kiwi-sized (NOT orange sized like the directions say) amount of the mousse and rub it through the bottom section of my hair. Then I use a big round brush, pull the hair from underneath and blow dry it up then under. Then I un-clip the top section of my hair, use about half the amount of mousse as before and rub it through the remaining wet hair. Then I flip my head upside down and blow dry using the brush on the outside and the dryer underneath, near my face, blowing outward.     Seriously, this product has changed the way my hair looks and feels. I used the same techniques with other products and the result was always incredibly blah.     I cost like 36 bucks but is totally worth it considering I&#x27;ve spent like triple that on crap cheap products that do not work and I end up throwing away. And it lasts at least 3 months so I&#x27;m actually spending less on a product that works longer and better than I would trying things out and having to purchase more often.</li>
    <li> Ordered a hair product from Amazon.  Hard to find in a salon.  Product was a good price and came very quickly. I will order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine hair, and Kerastase products work beautifully to provide volume and bounce without weighing the hair down or making it look \\&quot;frozen.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Did not add thickness to my hair, in fact felt flat.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have very fine shoulder length hair. This product really does give me extra volume and my hair feels thicker when I use it. I have found this works a little better than drug store brands but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because the price is so high (I paid $31.99 for it at a local store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use less than the recommended amount otherwise it is just way too much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for the very strong smell. I am sensitive to smells and this one is very strong and perfume-like until your hair dries.</li>
    <li> when I thought this product had been discontinued. Yes, it is embarrassingly expensive for a hair product, but I will fork over the money for the rest of my days because fluffy hair is worth it.</li>
    <li> I live in the southwest where it is difficult to achieve much volume in your hair.  The dry air tends to leave hair straight and flat.  I read about this product in a decorating magazine and decided to try it.  It works very well - even in this climate I can get some volume.  It is not inexpensive, unfortunately, but it works and is still light, not sticky or drying.  I use a little less than the recommended amount and am very pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> For years I had my hair done at a salon that used Kerastase products and I loved them so much that I purchased them for use at home.  I have very fine hair and it truly gave me volume and I also loved the fragrance.  When I moved away my new salon didn&#x27;t carry Kerastase and so I would buy the products online from Europe (they were hard to find online in the US).  I got tired of that after a few years and started using other products.  I recently searched the internet and was elated to find Kerastase on Amazon and ordered 2 cans of Mousse.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s even the same product.  First of all, there is no fragrance whatsoever and secondly it made my hair greasy and limp.  Could this be a knockoff?  It&#x27;s THAT different!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Gives your hair a nice lift</li>
    <li> not very effective as a conditioner ... amount of mouse suggested.. size of an oranage, leaves hair sticky and greasy.</li>
    <li> Considering how expensive Kerastase is. I went searching for an cheaper alternative. Well, you don&#x27;t know how good you&#x27;ve got it until you&#x27;ve encountered the other stuff. In trying drugstore brands and mid range brands like Nexxus. What I realize about Kerastase is that is leaves my hair feeling natural and clean, not sticky like the others. Additionally, in blow drying my hair. I noticed that it did give it a fullness and definition that other mousse did not. Kerastase helps to create as close of a full body blow out as I get from my salon. And, as I&#x27;ve been using Kerastase for the past year. As it is currently winter. In experimenting with other mousse, I realize Keratase never created the fly aways that other brands to. I am now dependent, annoyingly, as it is a  great product that&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves hair full of body. Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I normally really like Keratase products.  This mousse smells amazing, but I would not say it provides a lot of volume.  May be worth finding a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mousse for years.  I have fine hair and this is the only mousse that does not leave a sticky film on your hair or leaves it feeling heavy.  It does what a mousse is supposed to do.  Yes, it is a bit pricy, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.  It last me about 3 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> Salon used this on my hair &amp; it looked great so I ordered some,  use it only on top for volume &amp; shine &amp; it looks great. Working up to total use but can&#x27;t give up my Silk Repair for a day!</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Volumactive and have loved that product, finding it to be well worth the cost.  The new &#x27;improved&#x27; formula named Volumifique  has been formulated to be lighter than Volumactive, with the intent of providing greater volume for thin hair.  My experience however is the opposite, that I don&#x27;t get any real volume effects from the new version. This seems to be because the mousse is not dense or stiff enough.  Moreover, it is a struggle just to get product out of the can.  Each time I use it (not the first), which itself is very frustrating  My review is based on use with 2 cans (I always ordered 2 of the Volumactive in the past), so I can only assume that the lighter weight of the new formula is causing this problem.  I am quite disappointed &amp; will likely resort to some drugstore alternative.  Wish that Volumactive were still available, I&#x27;d buy it all up.</li>
    <li> I have full hair, but I still like to add volume when I style it.  I haven&#x27;t been using mousse because I hate the way it makes my hair kind-of sticky/oily/gross by the end of the day.  This had great reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d splurge and try it out.  But I kind of hoped I wouldn&#x27;t like it, because I&#x27;d really rather not spend that much money on hair products (especially since I already use their shampoo).  Unfortunately for my wallet, it works great, and there&#x27;s a huge difference in my hair&#x27;s volume between days I use it and days I don&#x27;t. If the price isn&#x27;t a deterrent for you, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife is a loyal fan of this product and the price offered by Amazon is highly competitive. However, one problem she has found is the nozzle sometimes sticks and then it suddenly rushes out.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the top is hard to get the product out. I buy this all the time and never had this happen before.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a decade. It is excellent. Occasionally, I try something new, but always go back to Keratase. Shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> I love almost all Kerastase products and this is no exception, gives great volume without leaving your hair heavy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Along with Bedhead&#x27;s Mega Whip, this gives me good hair. I&#x27;ve tried Jonathan mousse, Pantene, Kerastase, and others, but this gives the best results. Makes my hair appear fuller, and my hair is very thin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  It&#x27;s expensive and just plain doesn&#x27;t work, at least not on my hair.</li>
    <li> Mouse is applied after wash and combed into damp hair before blow drying.  Boosts volume significantly 2-3 times.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light mousse.  Love that it Volumnises without being overly heavy on the hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time but my last purchase was a disappointment. The mousse was faulty and I bought 2 cans of it.  Must have been in the warehouse too long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not yet sure it&#x27;s worth the price but it&#x27;s fine.  I need to use it longer to decide whether I will continue purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted more volume.  I have chin-length fine hair that is single processed. With the $40 price, I thought I would get spectacular results. The first time I used it, I let my hair air dry and the top layer was fuzzy.  So I brought it to my hairdresser who blew it dry and the top layer was still fuzzy and flyaway.  I live in a dry southwestern climate. I found this product to be too high priced and a waste of money.  I get better results from drugstore bought mousses by L&#x27;Oreal (who makes Keratase) at a fraction of the price.  In this case a higher price doesn&#x27;t purchase a better product.  I gave it two stars because it does give a small amount of \\&quot;cotton candy\\&quot; volume.</li>
    <li> They are so much better than other salon products I have wasted my money on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work, transforming my limp fine hair to looking beautiful!</li>
    <li> This product really makes your hair soft and I like the look I get. Also the style seems to stay in well. But it does not provide much volume. I have lots of hair, but it is baby fine and not a bit of natural wave.</li>
    <li> Best mousse I have ever used.Dosn&#x27;t give any weight to my hair and it gives a great volume!!!Plus, it&#x27;s very economical.</li>
    <li> BEST volumizing product on the market!!  It gives me ridiculously thick hair - try it!</li>
    <li> I swore by this after an operation left me with thinning hair for awhile.  I still love it, but the new packaging is almost impossible for me to manage. I can only get a very small stream of mousse by shaking the can a lot and pressing as hard as I can.  I don&#x27;t have this problem with any other product.</li>
    <li> Really like it. Gives moisture to my hair and texture but oh so soft. Smells great too. I do use root boost at the crown to give volume to my hair where I need it.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and so sad that Kerastase has discontinued it.  I would hope that they will reconsider.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for years and loveit.  these bottles are not the same they must be knockoffs. they&#x27;re not even in english, they were hard to start and the consistenty is not the same.  was bought from one stop beauty source</li>
    <li> USE THE CAN UPSIDE DOWN OTHEREWISE NOTHING COMES OUT. IT IS REACH BUT LIGHT. NO STICKY FEELING. DO NOT APPLY TOO MUCH THOUGH. A LITTLE IN THE PALM IS ENOUGH</li>
    <li> Same as any other product like it only way too expensive!</li>
    <li> Sorry, but the re-packaging of the mousse also changed the formula.  My hair was very dry looking and felt dry.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin short hair, this product is amazing as it does not just add volume but conditions my hair as well. I am writing this review primary for those of you who might be wondering what is the difference between the mousse and the liquid volumactive spray as I was wondering myself which one was the better and added the most volume, so I eventually purchased both. For those of you who wants a Varoom volume and control to your hair that lasts most all day choose the mousse. The liquid spray is indeed easier to apply, but I found it to be diluted and the volume quite loose and not as controlled as the mousse; thus if it is just a little volume you need then the spray is for you. With the mousse you can control the fullness easier with the amount you use. I love the mousse! I love the fullness it gives to my hair, and the scent is light and not overwhelming. Great product.</li>
    <li> EVEN THOUGH THESE PRODUCTS ARE EXPENSIVE, THEY ARE WORTH THE MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEPS HAIR SOFT.  I LOVE IT.  I RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using drug store stuff for years. I finally took the plunge and treated myself to this product. I have very fine, flat hair. This stuff is incredible, and a little goes a long way. I apply from root to tip, dry my hair, and curl - my curl lasts all day and I have tons of body. My hair looked thicker and very natural. I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite product!</li>
    <li> Gives volume without stiffness with only a tablespoon size amount,  Hair looks even better the next day.  No greasy buildup.  Have been using Kerastase mousse for 2 years.</li>
