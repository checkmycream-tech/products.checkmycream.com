      <li>so finding this on amazon was great.</li>
      <li>it felt great going on, wasn&#x27;t overly sticky or greasy.</li>
      <li>The scent WAS very light and very pleasant.</li>
      <li>Pleasant scent</li>
      <li>I like to stick with a good product once I&#x27;ve found it, but I won&#x27;t be buying the Nature&#x27;s Gate lotions anymore</li>
      <li>good value.</li>
      <li>I have loved it for years.</li>
      <li>It has a very light, pleasant scent, not at all flowery or overpowering, which is great for those of us who don&#x27;t like stinky lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for the best hydrating lotion and this one is pretty good</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Spreads nice and is an amazing moisturizer with no alcohol sting.</li>
      <li>No perfume like smell just nice and herbal smelling.</li>
      <li>This lotion smells nice, and isn&#x27;t too oily ( I can apply some to my hands and still use the mouse.)</li>
      <li>I ended up giving this to my mother (who really liked it).</li>
      <li>With all my searching, the Amazon store is by far the best source for this product.</li>
      <li>For the price, this is by far the best body lotion I have used.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the quality.  </li>
      <li>I love Nature&#x27;s Gate products.</li>
      <li>My favorite part about it.</li>
      <li>this has been my favorite lotion for years.</li>
      <li>Nothing works better.</li>
      <li>I just think there must be better out there</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it for many years to come.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good for my ultra-dry skin, but do make sure that you receive what you ordered.</li>
      <li>Maybe it is inconsistent coming from the manufacturer and the quality varies, but now I have a large supply and find nothing particularly remarkable about it.</li>
      <li>I feel it is the best moisturizing cream I have used for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Loved the first bottle of the lotion.</li>
      <li>Love that I can feel comfortable using this on my children.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I really enjoy Nature&#x27;s Gate products, this lotion burned my face.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this lotion for years and loved it, the scent was just right, subtle and nice.</li>
      <li>My husband actually likes it and says it&#x27;s vaguely reminiscent of cinnamon, which is a good thing because he doesn&#x27;t like scented anything!  </li>
      <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate hemp oil sources are natural and raised without pesticides or other additives and the hemp plant itself provides anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties that are a welcome addition to the soothing and healing.</li>
      <li>I recently ran out, and went to purchase more.</li>
      <li>I tested this in a store and found the lotion rich and the smell intoxicating; I could barely stop sniffing my arm.  </li>
      <li>(also bought the fragrance free recently and don&#x27;t like the texture now--</li>
      <li>It seems to absorb readily and moisturizes well without leaving a greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>I read the other reviews and couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
      <li>And it has a pleasant smell that is not in the least over bearing!</li>
      <li>goes on smooth goes in and stops itching and flaking dry skin</li>
      <li>But it smelt like bananas going on and then made my clothes smell like a particular used book shop (I like the shop</li>
      <li>I often try to get non-scented lotions for work, but this one has such a mild scent that it doesn&#x27;t bother anyone.  </li>
      <li>I found the \\&quot;New and improved\\&quot; formula.  </li>
      <li>It has a slight nutty clean smell, which my whole office likes.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day, even after washing my hands!</li>
      <li>I love how this lotion is so rich that the next day when I shower I can still feel it on my skin, yet when you are applying it; it is not at all greasy or thick!</li>
      <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate uses natural non toxic ingredients in their products and they do NOT test on animals!&lt;br</li>
      <li>(To me it has an old lady smell...</li>
      <li>so it still works as such, but the consistency is quite runny and the scent is much weaker than I remembered.  </li>
      <li>keeps my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick enough to be effective, but not greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>The last time I bought it, they&#x27;d changed the formulation, calling it new and improved</li>
      <li>So this is the first time I have bought this lotion in a few years</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I discovered Nature&#x27;s Gate hemp oil lotion about 8-9 years ago when I had problems with chafing and yeast infections on my skin. I grabbed it because it was close and I was in agony from the pain and irritation. When I woke up the next morning the area was healed and the usual darkness of the affected area had nearly cleared up. I continued using it and no longer had problems with chafing and yeast infections even in the hottest and muggiest times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used powders and bag balm and nothing worked like this. The others only covered the problem and didn&#x27;t solve it. I use nothing but hemp oil lotion now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading up on the benefits of hemp oil, I am sold. Nature&#x27;s Gate hemp oil sources are natural and raised without pesticides or other additives and the hemp plant itself provides anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties that are a welcome addition to the soothing and healing. Nothing works better.</li>
    <li> goes on smooth goes in and stops itching and flaking dry skin</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I often try to get non-scented lotions for work, but this one has such a mild scent that it doesn&#x27;t bother anyone.  My husband actually likes it and says it&#x27;s vaguely reminiscent of cinnamon, which is a good thing because he doesn&#x27;t like scented anything!  It seems to absorb readily and moisturizes well without leaving a greasy feeling.  I apply this lotion and then immediately go back to using my Logitech trackball mouse with no problems.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this lotion for years and loved it, the scent was just right, subtle and nice. The last time I bought it, they&#x27;d changed the formulation, calling it new and improved and I can&#x27;t stand the smell now. Whatever they did, it&#x27;s not an improvement. I like to stick with a good product once I&#x27;ve found it, but I won&#x27;t be buying the Nature&#x27;s Gate lotions anymore (also bought the fragrance free recently and don&#x27;t like the texture now--it&#x27;s reminiscent of white glue). Maybe the improvements were to the company&#x27;s bottom line and not to the products? All I know is I don&#x27;t like what they&#x27;ve done.</li>
    <li> I received three bottles that looked alike. Loved the first bottle of the lotion. Started using the second one today only to realize it&#x27;s soap. Whoever packed this wasn&#x27;t looking closely, and neither was I. When I received this I just took out one bottle and put the rest in the closet. Other than that I like the scent and it&#x27;s pretty good for my ultra-dry skin, but do make sure that you receive what you ordered. The soap costs about half what the lotion costs, so I&#x27;m feeling a little ripped off, but it&#x27;s too late to complain, since the bag has been sitting in my closed for a few weeks...</li>
    <li> I like this lotion.  It works well for my dry skin in the winter.  It&#x27;s thick enough to be effective, but not greasy at all.  I don&#x27;t find my skin getting dry between uses, so I&#x27;d say it does its job well!  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but that&#x27;s simply a matter of personal preference.  (To me it has an old lady smell...sorry, I don&#x27;t have a better description.)  It&#x27;s not strong enough that the smell lingers, so it&#x27;s not really a big issue.</li>
    <li> My family loves this lotion!  It&#x27;s not greasy.  It is a great moisturizing lotion!</li>
    <li> There is an area I have trouble with itching. Other lotions are just not very effective at quelling the agony. This is the only one I have found that works. With all my searching, the Amazon store is by far the best source for this product.</li>
    <li> this has been my favorite lotion for years. keeps my skin soft and moisturized. good value.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day, even after washing my hands! Does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is by far the best body lotion I have used. Pleasant scent</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions out there. It feels and smells so wonderful. I love Nature&#x27;s Gate products.</li>
    <li> I tested this in a store and found the lotion rich and the smell intoxicating; I could barely stop sniffing my arm.  I went for the 3 pack on Amazon, but I don&#x27;t know...something is different.  It&#x27;s lotion so it still works as such, but the consistency is quite runny and the scent is much weaker than I remembered.  Maybe it is inconsistent coming from the manufacturer and the quality varies, but now I have a large supply and find nothing particularly remarkable about it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the quality.  Love that I can feel comfortable using this on my children.  Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells nice, and isn&#x27;t too oily ( I can apply some to my hands and still use the mouse.)</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and couldn&#x27;t agree more. I mean as far as the scent goes. I have been using this Hemp Lotion for years. Every morning on my face after shower. I have loved it for years. The scent WAS very light and very pleasant. My favorite part about it. I recently ran out, and went to purchase more. I found the \\&quot;New and improved\\&quot; formula.  Seems the scent is a little stronger. Not sure I care much for it. Spoke with Nature&#x27;s Gate. They did things to improve the formula and it affected the scent.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore so finding this on amazon was great. No perfume like smell just nice and herbal smelling. Spreads nice and is an amazing moisturizer with no alcohol sting.</li>
    <li> I love how this lotion is so rich that the next day when I shower I can still feel it on my skin, yet when you are applying it; it is not at all greasy or thick! And it has a pleasant smell that is not in the least over bearing!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this moisturizer at a local store a couple of years ago, but they discontinued carrying it.  So this is the first time I have bought this lotion in a few years and it is as wonderful as I remember.  It has a slight nutty clean smell, which my whole office likes.  My skin feels like silk (from all the nut oils and salix alba (willow bark))and it is the dead winter.  Will definitely buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still looking for the best hydrating lotion and this one is pretty good so it gets 4-stars... I just think there must be better out there but this one will do for now</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate uses natural non toxic ingredients in their products and they do NOT test on animals!&lt;br /&gt;While I really enjoy Nature&#x27;s Gate products, this lotion burned my face. It&#x27;s not a face lotion but typically I can use any lotions on my face. Not this one. It&#x27;s a great body lotion though!</li>
    <li> This is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever come across, hands-down. It has a nice consistency, not too thin and not too thick, and it isn&#x27;t greasy. It absorbs quickly. Don&#x27;t let the fact that it&#x27;s hemp scare you off — you won&#x27;t smell like a hippie or stoner. It has a very light, pleasant scent, not at all flowery or overpowering, which is great for those of us who don&#x27;t like stinky lotion.</li>
    <li> I ended up giving this to my mother (who really liked it). It works well: it felt great going on, wasn&#x27;t overly sticky or greasy. But it smelt like bananas going on and then made my clothes smell like a particular used book shop (I like the shop but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it as a personal fragrance). It conflicted with my perfume (everything took on a very green note, like I&#x27;d added a hefty dose of galbanum to all my perfumes). Couldn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> I feel it is the best moisturizing cream I have used for a long time.  I will continue to use it for many years to come.</li>
