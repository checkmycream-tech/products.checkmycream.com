<li> This is a SOLID black..</li>
<li> So if you are looking for a solid black, no Shades.. this is the color to get.</li>
<li> Not black with a tint of green or black with a tint of brown.</li>
<li> Not too thick, but dense enough that you only need one coat.</li>
<li> I purchased this and applied two coats over a base, and a top coat.  </li>
<li> this is the blackest black you can buy.</li>
<li> You need to use two coats so It looks as black as it foes in the bottle.</li>
<li> I wanted a solid hard black and you get it with this Essie !</li>
<li> This color is EXACTLY black.</li>
<li> Perfectly black.</li>
<li> JUST BLACK!</li>
<li> You have to like black!</li>
<li> In the NOT good way.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thin.</li>

    <li> love it!I also purchased the matte topcoat and this combo is killer! It looks really elegant! You have to like black!</li>
    <li> This review is for the Essie Licorice Nail Polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think everyone should own one black polish but there are so many! Especially once you get into the weeds of there being many SHADES of black.. This is a SOLID black.. There is not a shade of green, purple, red, blue, or any other color.. So if you are looking for a solid black, no Shades.. this is the color to get.</li>
    <li> Beautiful black great coverage not too runny or thick. The great quality you expect from Essie.  And cleans up easily if you&#x27;re not an expert.</li>
    <li> Receive it on time haven&#x27;t used it yet, but hope to soon, I been what&#x27;d and black cool nail polish now I have it</li>
    <li> Comes off easily!! ...In the NOT good way. Even with a topcoat, which is just special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you plan on layering the heck out of it, expect it to scratch off the minute you take your eyes off of your fingers. On the bright side, one coat does a suitable job, and two coats does a near perfect one.</li>
    <li> This color is EXACTLY black. Not black with a tint of green or black with a tint of brown. JUST BLACK! Essie is a wonderful brand. It lasts long with a good top coat (Seche Vite) &amp; doesn&#x27;t chip. The only problem I have, is the brush. It&#x27;s very thin. I have very long nails so it takes forever to cover the entire nail with the tiny brush. Other than that, I love this nail polish. If you&#x27;re considering this product, go ahead &amp; buy it!</li>
    <li> Definitely a good color, &amp; type of brand. Essie is amazing to give for girl presents.</li>
