<li> I&#x27;ve been mainly using clips and bobby pins instead of hair ties due to its length</li>
<li> The brown one is the one I got 2 years ago, the white grey thing is what I received.</li>
<li> not as wavy as the picture and less natural</li>
<li> The wig wasn&#x27;t  as long as the picture</li>
<li> The bangs were a bit long</li>
<li> but thats expected as its a long wig,just use a wide tooth comb and start at the bottom working your way up.</li>
<li> , I hope to get it sooner than is expected, I&#x27;ll let ya&#x27;all know if the wig whorts it</li>
<li> but I trimmed it down.</li>
<li> packaged in a plastic bag and the wig is in netting,it also comes with a black wig cap.&lt;br</li>
<li> No as long and thick as I want</li>
<li> The only thing that has really disappointed me is how easily it tangles, and once it tangles, it is near impossible to fix.</li>
<li> and the color was a little bit off</li>
<li> Nothing a little brushing out wouldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
<li> That being said, It&#x27;s very soft, doesn&#x27;t tangle that much, which is shocking considering its length, and has a lot of thickness and volume to it throughout.</li>
<li> its like ugly greyish blonde dont waste ur money</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t mean to press a button</li>
<li> This ratty style goes well with my broken doll costume</li>
<li> It came and was the wrong color..</li>
<li> I hated this wig it was so thin</li>
<li> completely disappointed In it</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t mean to press a button</li>
    <li> Love this wig, wore it to my mums wedding. It&#x27;s really not as thin as some of the reviews say it is</li>
    <li> It only took 10 days to recive,earlier than expected.the wig is long,soft and very thick,i could not see the cap/netting.im 5&#x27;3/5&#x27;4 and it hit right behind my knee.&lt;br /&gt;Its packaged in a plastic bag and the wig is in netting,it also comes with a black wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;It does knot easily but thats expected as its a long wig,just use a wide tooth comb and start at the bottom working your way up.</li>
    <li> It came and was the wrong color.. So I got my money back, I really wanted it for a cosplay I&#x27;m doing but now I gotta look some place else. .-.</li>
    <li> The with is a bit lighter then the one in the photo but I still love it. This is my first wig so I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of it but I do know it&#x27;s synthetic but easily malleable. I&#x27;ve been mainly using clips and bobby pins instead of hair ties due to its length</li>
    <li> Super cute.  Get a wig brush.  Even though it tangles easy it still looks good after it tangles I wouldn&#x27;t suggest brushing it much. But the color and the wig look beautiful wearing.</li>
    <li> Its a lighter color then the picture (and shorter too) it&#x27;ll still work for what I had planned for it but it wasn&#x27;t exactly like the picture.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig, very long too. Will be great for Halloween or just a change in color for a day or so.</li>
    <li> Wig is good quality and soft, easy to style, absolutely what I needed. The colour is pictured/described perfectly as well! I&#x27;d also like to thank you for the quick shipping, I really appreciate it! Highly recommend this seller, and this wig!</li>
    <li> I hated this wig it was so thin</li>
    <li> I adore it. I was asked by a hair salon owner if it was my real hair.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL! it&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than the picture shows, it&#x27;s yellow like corn. That being said, It&#x27;s very soft, doesn&#x27;t tangle that much, which is shocking considering its length, and has a lot of thickness and volume to it throughout. Very good wig for the price!</li>
    <li> When I got my wig in it looked NOTHING like the picture the top of it was all choppy and disfigured and the color of it was whiter than my grandmothers hair!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely disappointed In it and if I known it was like this I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m think this item is beautiful. It has a tendency to tangle but that isn&#x27;t something that bothers me considering the length it&#x27;s bound to happen. The item is just how it&#x27;s described and so so soft .</li>
    <li> No as long and thick as I want and it&#x27;s not officially from X &amp;Y ANGEL</li>
    <li> Product arrived exactly one week after purchase. Arrived faster than I had anticipated. The color is actually a little lighter than the image shown, but I was fine with that. Feels like real hair and very soft to the touch. It was my first time purchasing a wig and trying one on, but I was extremely pleased with it. It&#x27;s easily tangled but that&#x27;s to be expected. Nothing a little brushing out wouldn&#x27;t fix. The bangs were a bit long but I trimmed it down. In all, it&#x27;s wonderful and I highly recommend it. c:</li>
    <li> not as wavy as the picture and less natural</li>
    <li> So I bought a wig like this 2 years ago on eBay but because of the tangles I had to cut it. When I saw this I was like \\&quot;oh cool I&#x27;ll buy another and keep it nice and pretty\\&quot; but this is what I got  The brown one is the one I got 2 years ago, the white grey thing is what I received. It looks nothing like the picture. Honestly it looks like a wig from party co. Never again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I see a curly wig of this length and bought it. The quality is good, will buy from this seller again. If only it comes in darker colors...</li>
    <li> this is not nearly as long as the photo (im only 5 feet tall!!)and it is also the ugliest color i have ever seen its like ugly greyish blonde dont waste ur money</li>
    <li> The wig wasn&#x27;t  as long as the picture I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5 so it hit right at my but but yeahs wit was longer when I straightened it happy about that and the color was a little bit off but that doesn&#x27;t  matter and you couldn&#x27;t see the cap so other wise it was good came early too:)</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for cosplay. It&#x27;s good for taking pictures but not will not recommend to wear out door.</li>
    <li> Came in earlier. The wig is really nice. I love it :)&lt;br /&gt;it feels like real hair. No regrets. :)</li>
    <li> so I&#x27;m waiting for this wig, looks amazing in the picture tho, I hope to get it sooner than is expected, I&#x27;ll let ya&#x27;all know if the wig whorts it</li>
    <li> The wig is beautiful, and it surprisingly matches my own natural hair color. Since I&#x27;m short (5ft1) it lands about mid thigh. The only thing that has really disappointed me is how easily it tangles, and once it tangles, it is near impossible to fix. This ratty style goes well with my broken doll costume I have it planned for, but I was really looking forward to using it as a cute fashion wig as well. I guess once Halloween had passed, I&#x27;ll cut it.</li>
    <li> Was definitely not the color in picture. More of a yellow blonde. For the price though, it&#x27;ll be great for anime matsuri in a couple weeks :)</li>
