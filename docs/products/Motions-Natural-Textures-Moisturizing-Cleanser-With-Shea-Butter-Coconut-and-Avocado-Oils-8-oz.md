      <li>This Motions Moisturizing Cleanser for hair does a fabulous job of cleaning ur hair without leaving it feeling dry or stripped, so u get shiny clean, healthy, and manageable hair.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, basic shampoo.</li>
      <li>I liked the scent and it left my beard with a softer texture.</li>
      <li>This Motions Naturally You is a nice line with high quality hair products.</li>
      <li>I used Motions Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser in place of shampoo - so silky and rich!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s appropriate that they call it a moisturizing cleanser since it is a bit different from any shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;It&#x27;s the first conditioning shampoo that you can use without having to use a conditioner anyway,\\&quot; she said.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean and soft after using and it rinses out well.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend this for constant use instead of a good, regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
      <li>This product is very tricky to use.</li>
      <li>Her scalp was flaky after using, her hair wasn&#x27;t smooth after rinsing, and I was left combing out strands that were almost sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>It took a lot of product to really saturate the hair.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing though.</li>
      <li>But, I don&#x27;t feel it actually really cleaned.</li>
      <li>This is a very affordable product.</li>
      <li>They said that it really moisurized well.</li>
      <li>This product is actually much better than expected.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference after using it.</li>
      <li>Put a quarters worth in your hair message it in let it stay for a few seconds for better results.</li>
      <li>I was having some major issues with my scalp being dry, a friend suggested this and it worked amazing.  </li>
      <li>My wife, in particular, really likes the product and has been using it on her permed hair</li>
      <li>This product left my hair full of body and not greasy.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t figure out how \\&quot;I would know\\&quot;, she has subsequently utilized more in the product line and is looking better than ever---at least hair-wise (jab)</li>
      <li>I have tried many less foaming shampoos and have been underwhelmed with the results.  </li>
      <li>My hair is not very curly, but it is wavy and gets frizzy fairly easily.</li>
      <li>highly Recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>She highly recommends it.</li>
      <li>Even better, a little goes</li>
      <li>Then rinse out and use your normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would be a good product to keep around for your hair after swimming, when your hair feels stiff and dry.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For thick curly hair in the dry Alaskan winter, this cleanser followed by the conditioner leaves a very nice result.</li>
      <li>I struggle to find a cleaner that does not dry my natural hair out too much.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes if the hair is a little more greasy closer to the scalp, a second wash is needed.</li>
      <li>No amount of rinsing will completely clear my hair of this product, and when it dries.</li>

      <li>used my normal styling products and my hair was still a giant frizzball.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It cleans pretty well and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the hair, but I definitely do not think it added any moisture, even when used with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It left my hair really greasy and flat.  </li>
      <li>I deleted the natural ones and this is what is left:  </li>
      <li>I feel like it made it more greasy, which is not ideal for me since my hair is naturally oily anyway.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not lather as much as other shampoos which I was hoping was a plus since my hair is generally very</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind using enough product to get the job done, but this didn&#x27;t last very long and didn&#x27;t really work for her.</li>
      <li>Reading through the reviews, it is clear that for different types of hair, there can be quite a different</li>
      <li>These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized.</li>
      <li>It smells decent and doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.</li>
      <li>But it is very thick (which can be good, as this means a little goes a long way, and this stuff lasts a long time)</li>

    <li> It left my hair really greasy and flat.  I tried it for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> the product was below my expection It ddn&#x27; t keep my hair mositurized  other folks make find this pruduct work great for them  but not for me</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and it keep your very much clean leaves your hair soft, and smelling also good....great job!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shampoo products I have used on my curly hair.  My scalp feels quite clean and my hair does not feel stripped after.  I have tried many less foaming shampoos and have been underwhelmed with the results.  This product is actually much better than expected.</li>
    <li> Since I go to the pool frequently, my hair is usually quite dry.  This Motions shampoo puts moisture back in.  It&#x27;s appropriate that they call it a moisturizing cleanser since it is a bit different from any shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.  It&#x27;s kind of like a conditioner.  Other than correcting the damage done from the chlorine in the pool, this would be too thick for me and my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very affordable product. The results provided from this product are comparable to Nexxus and Paul Mitchell. Even better, a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very nice (even my husband remarked on the light, pretty scent)and I will definitely be buying this product again. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This Motions Naturally You is a nice line with high quality hair products. Reading through the reviews, it is clear that for different types of hair, there can be quite a different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For thick curly hair in the dry Alaskan winter, this cleanser followed by the conditioner leaves a very nice result. Hair feels fuller, thicker, shinier, bouncier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not find this product heavy or greasy. Hair looked more vibrant when done. Works great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very tricky to use. Too much applied and your hair is left like a grease ball. Too little applied and you have the urge to need to wash it over again the same or next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to waste the product so I found a way you can use it on Caucasian hair: if you have product built up in your hair like mousse, gel or hairspray, use a quarter size on hair. Then rinse out and use your normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the ingredients are not all natural or great either, some are very questionable. I deleted the natural ones and this is what is left:  Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Cocamidoproyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Glycol Distearate, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Methychloroisothiazolinoe, Methylisothiazolinone, Allantoin,  Magnexium Citrate, Propylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate Sodium Hydroxide,  Polysorbate 60, Stearic Acid, Myristic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butyl Methoxydibenzolymethane, Alpha-Glucan Oligasaccharide, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 3, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will stick to Giovanni Organic, Kiss my Face or Jason Hair products.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my five year old daughter who has very curly, mixed hair.  The product smelled great but was not as moisturizing as I expected, it lathered well but her hair still felt dry while I was washing it.  It made me nervous that even with a conditioner her hair would be dried out after washing and it was. I will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was really impressed with the Motions Naturally Moisturizing Cleanser.I have this curly hair. This product left my hair full of body and not greasy. That is something that I am looking for in a moisturizing cleanser. The scent is pleasant. Put a quarters worth in your hair message it in let it stay for a few seconds for better results. Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I used Motions Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser in place of shampoo - so silky and rich! I still used a dab of conditioner to help with detangling (my curly hair is past my waist), but I scarcely needed it. I used to think my hair was too oily for things like this, but it didn&#x27;t seem to mind a bit being pampered. Nice stuff!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair clean and strong and easy to manage.  The instructions say you should use this once a week. I have noticed the more I use it the stronger my hair feels.  And I like the smell, not too much of a perfume smell but light and fragrant.</li>
    <li> I ordered several projects from the Motions hair line. Prior to the last order, I ordered their curl butter and another product and was totally dissatisfied. With that being said, the reviews on these other Motions products I ordered will probably be the same. I was totally disappointed that an entire line of hair products missed the mark. I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future. Not only did they do what they said they&#x27;d do, after the 1st hour or so, but the residue and build up in my hair, caused me to have to cut sections of my hair to get the residue and knots out of my hair. Out of the 9 products I tried there were only two that did anything for me and that was moisturizing cleanser and the deep conditioning hair masque. These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized. I can actually run a comb or brush through it without pulling out plugs. I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is OK, I can not say I noticed any real difference to my hair.  Fragrance is nice.  Easy tube to use in the shower.  OK product.</li>
    <li> Actually, I especially liked it for my beard....not quite what I presume its purpose is.  I liked the scent and it left my beard with a softer texture.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick, dry, coarse, long hair. I thought that this might be a great way to get it manageable for her without a lot of fuss. Well, it was moisturizing, I&#x27;ll give it that. But, I don&#x27;t feel it actually really cleaned. Her scalp was flaky after using, her hair wasn&#x27;t smooth after rinsing, and I was left combing out strands that were almost sticky feeling. It took a lot of product to really saturate the hair. I don&#x27;t mind using enough product to get the job done, but this didn&#x27;t last very long and didn&#x27;t really work for her.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/cleanser does not do it for me.  The product is not like any shampoo I have used before.  It comes out of the tube real thick.  Almost like a body gel or a thick product for treating real dry hands.  It comes out like a masque of some sort for your hair.  I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance either.  Also found it hard to rinse out because it was so thick.  I don&#x27;t recommend buying this one if those things bother you.  They bothered me and I threw out the rest of the product after trying twice.</li>
    <li> I was having some major issues with my scalp being dry, a friend suggested this and it worked amazing.  You only have to use a little bit of it and it is going to go a really long ways to help you.</li>
    <li> I struggle to find a cleaner that does not dry my natural hair out too much.  This cleanser is it!  It cleanses, yet leaves my hair feeling well moisturized even before a follow up leave-in or rinse out conditioner.  A new favorite.</li>
    <li> My hair is not very curly, but it is wavy and gets frizzy fairly easily. This Cleanser didn&#x27;t work that well on my hair. I feel like it made it more greasy, which is not ideal for me since my hair is naturally oily anyway. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference after using it. I have thick hair, but it&#x27;s not coarse, so maybe it really is meant for that specific type of hair. Either way, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> This Motions Naturally You cleanser is really good for getting grime out of the hair. I accidentally leaned against some sort of an oily substance in a car garage and had to get it out of my hair. Ooola. It smells decent and doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down. I do use it and would recommend it to others for regular use.</li>
    <li> This Motions Moisturizing Cleanser for hair does a fabulous job of cleaning ur hair without leaving it feeling dry or stripped, so u get shiny clean, healthy, and manageable hair. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I do not think this helps clean my hair, but it could add moisturize it. This product feels a bit greasy to me as well and after several hours, my hair starts to feel greasy anyway, so this product is not suitable for my type of hair. I really can&#x27;t recommend this for constant use instead of a good, regular shampoo. It would be a good product to keep around for your hair after swimming, when your hair feels stiff and dry. But for daily use, a good shampoo and conditioner is what I would prefer.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and scalp and my hair is curly. Motions Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser worked great. I think it has a good smell and feels nice on your head/hair as you use it. I have no complaints. Some friends of color used it when visiting for a few days and they thought it was great, too. They said that it really moisurized well.</li>
    <li> This is a quality cleanser that I use before applying other Motions hair product for a lusturous shine. highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Have an age old friend who is \\&quot;all about the hair\\&quot;. Never satisfied with the way it looks , I obtained several Motions At Home products for her. Mostly I obtained these as a practical joke , presenting her with a dozen or so products at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out she is ecstatic with the results! Couldn&#x27;t figure out how \\&quot;I would know\\&quot;, she has subsequently utilized more in the product line and is looking better than ever---at least hair-wise (jab)</li>
    <li> I tend to avoid combination shampoo/moisturizers because my hair seems to absorb everything and these products often make me feel as though I have to shampoo daily--which is NOT best for my color-treated hair. I have been quite happy with this product. My hair feels clean and soft after using and it rinses out well. The Motions Naturally You line seems to be kinder and gentler on hair, and yet delivers quite nicely. I do rotate shampoos but this one has definitely made its way into my rotation. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, basic shampoo. It lathers pretty nicely, rinses easily and there is no buildup. Sometimes if the hair is a little more greasy closer to the scalp, a second wash is needed. It also smells good, which is also nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing though. It cleans pretty well and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the hair, but I definitely do not think it added any moisture, even when used with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars</li>
    <li> Motions Moisturizing Cleanser does precisely what it claims to do. It cleans your hair, while also hydrating it, without the need to use a conditioner. It leaves your hair shiny and healthy. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, but cleanses and conditions well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring shea butter, coconut and avocado oils, it has a pleasant fragrance. My wife, in particular, really likes the product and has been using it on her permed hair and she likes the way the product cleans and leaves her hair feeling moisturized. She highly recommends it. \\&quot;It&#x27;s the first conditioning shampoo that you can use without having to use a conditioner anyway,\\&quot; she said.</li>
    <li> The product is thick and creamy. It has an overly tropical scent that I didn&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;It does not lather as much as other shampoos which I was hoping was a plus since my hair is generally very dry.&lt;br /&gt;While shampooing it felt nice and soft. After I rinsed it I feel like it stripped every bit of moisture from my hair. Even using conditioner didnt help. It felt sticky (how your hair feels after rinsing a coloring agent).&lt;br /&gt;I used my normal styling products and my hair was still a giant frizzball.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Motions Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I guess...it does clean your hair; but I&#x27;m not one for a lot of residue, even though I know hair with a lot of conditioner in it is shinier. No amount of rinsing will completely clear my hair of this product, and when it dries. there are stiff spots in some areas. I will give it this: my hair looks softer and shinier after I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;m just not comfortable with what&#x27;s left over from the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> .....or you&#x27;ll never get it all out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this for my son, who has very thick and very curly hair. It works well on him and leaves his hair clean and healthy. But it is very thick (which can be good, as this means a little goes a long way, and this stuff lasts a long time) so it is easy to overdo it. It took me awhile to get used to using such a small amount on him, but I&#x27;ve got the hang of it now. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product and I am happy with it.</li>
