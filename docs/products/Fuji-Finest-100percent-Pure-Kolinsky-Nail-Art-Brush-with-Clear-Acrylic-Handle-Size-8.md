      <li>surprisingly good.</li>
      <li>I came across this brush and saw some good reviews and decided to take a chance.</li>
      <li>and it does not even work that good</li>
      <li>good price good package just what i wanted i got the brush on time</li>
      <li>Good quality, arrived on time</li>
      <li>just as described looks like its good quality</li>
      <li>but honestly, the quality is so good i expect nothing but good to come from this brush.</li>
      <li>Product arrived before time very satisfied</li>
      <li>and I just love it!</li>
      <li>Got the item in very good condition and the brush is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality bristles, can&#x27;t say enough about how much I have loved this brush!</li>
      <li>It makes applying acrylic super easy!!  </li>
      <li>I already made my nails with this brush and it took me a short time the form is perfect,  </li>
      <li>So this was a much better deal.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brush and also order a size 6.</li>
      <li>I also purchased a #6 brush, the same brand and model, and it works wonderfully for my 3D designs.</li>
      <li>This brush is so much better than the size 10 of this brand.</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t want to buy this product, because it didn&#x27;t have any reviews, but since the price is not bad I decided to go for it.</li>
      <li>Great brush so far.  </li>
      <li>I love this brush,  it really keeps it&#x27;s shape !!  </li>
      <li>If you like huge brushes then you will be happy, but this is not a standard size 8.</li>
      <li>They are easy to clean and hold their shape well.</li>
      <li>It has a nice firm belly so you can move acrylic during the application process with good control.</li>
      <li>When I received my brush I could not be happier, the quality is great, I have used it several times now and it keeps its shape, and the clear handle makes it look so sophisticated</li>
      <li>My acrylics r coming out so much nicer!!</li>
      <li>Simple amazing</li>
      <li>It picks up and releases the right amount of liquid almost automatic</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t forsee needing it right now as this brush has held up so well!</li>
      <li>This is as good or even better than the most expensive bush I have owned!</li>
      <li>On an up note, I got it SUPER fast.</li>
      <li>Thank you for your shipping soon actually this product I love</li>
      <li>and i really like the brush.</li>
      <li>It absorbs way too much monomer</li>
      <li>I recently started doing my own nails and purchased a set of acrylic brushes to practice, but the acrylic would get stuck in the bristles after the second nails.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a new nail tech and just learning how to sustain my brushes</li>
      <li>The brush should be about half as full as it is.</li>
      <li>and if you use high quality professional monomer this brush will cost you money in the long run.</li>
      <li>the only reason i only gave 4 stars is because durability really matters to me</li>
      <li>I have bought many much more expensive brushes only to be disappointed in the lack of long term quality (many fell apart in under 2 weeks).</li>
      <li>Plus another nail company sells this exact same brush a few dollars higher without the shipping price and I looked on Amazon before purchasing from the other site and found this exact same brush for a few dollars cheaper with the shipping included.</li>

    <li> Product arrived before time very satisfied</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t want to buy this product, because it didn&#x27;t have any reviews, but since the price is not bad I decided to go for it. When I received my brush I could not be happier, the quality is great, I have used it several times now and it keeps its shape, and the clear handle makes it look so sophisticated, agh, I don&#x27;t get tired of it. I also purchased a #6 brush, the same brand and model, and it works wonderfully for my 3D designs.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the quality of this brush to use with acrylic. I don&#x27;t recommended . The acrylic sticks to it and I use Ez Flow brand.</li>
    <li> surprisingly good. well balanced , I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good quality, arrived on time and I just love it! Is ver very good and for the price you cant ask for more. Simple amazing</li>
    <li> Got the item in very good condition and the brush is worth the money. .. will definitely order these again when needed</li>
    <li> I love this brush!! My acrylics r coming out so much nicer!!</li>
    <li> The brush should be about half as full as it is. If you like huge brushes then you will be happy, but this is not a standard size 8. It absorbs way too much monomer and if you use high quality professional monomer this brush will cost you money in the long run. However, if you use the &amp;#34;one ball method&amp;#34; then you might appreciate this brush.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your shipping soon actually this product I love helps me a lot to use that I&#x27;m giving it. I recommend this product is of very good quality.</li>
    <li> its really big ...... and the hair fell out</li>
    <li> Great brushe 100% affordable</li>
    <li> I already made my nails with this brush and it took me a short time the form is perfect,  I&#x27;m realy happy. 100% recomended.</li>
    <li> good price good package just what i wanted i got the brush on time i bought two other thing and i was satisfy...thnx..</li>
    <li> i held my breath and bought this kolinsky brush for the 1st time. i cannot be happier! the only reason i only gave 4 stars is because durability really matters to me and i&#x27;d like to see how it holds up 1st but honestly, the quality is so good i expect nothing but good to come from this brush. a definite recommended buy!</li>
    <li> I have been doing nails for 22 years and have used every brush out there.  This is as good or even better than the most expensive bush I have owned! I have two sizes a #6 and a #8. I just ordered another #8 to put back for later. I really don&#x27;t forsee needing it right now as this brush has held up so well! And the price, what a deal! I can buy two of these to the one I was using from Sally Beauty. Excellent quality bristles, can&#x27;t say enough about how much I have loved this brush!</li>
    <li> Even though the brush I received doesn&#x27;t look like the one i received it&#x27;s still a kolinsky brush #8 and it came in a tube and i really like the brush.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this brush. I read the previous reviews on it, and I hoped I got the same results, but sadly...it wasn&#x27;t the case. The brush doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape, and it was bigger than I thought it would be. I&#x27;ve seen other size 8&#x27;s but this one seemed a bigger than the others. On an up note, I got it SUPER fast. Don&#x27;t waste your $</li>
    <li> I have now bought 2 of these brushes (different sizes). These brushes are perfectly shaped and hold tons of monomer. They are easy to clean and hold their shape well. I have bought many much more expensive brushes only to be disappointed in the lack of long term quality (many fell apart in under 2 weeks). This brush was less than half of what I normally spend. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these. Great value!</li>
    <li> This brush is so much better than the size 10 of this brand. It has a nice firm belly so you can move acrylic during the application process with good control. It picks up and releases the right amount of liquid almost automatic so each ball for the trained nail tech is perfect.</li>
    <li> Great brush so far.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> Junk, the hairs started coming out immediately. I&#x27;m a new nail tech and just learning how to sustain my brushes thought I would get this one for a back up. My opinion don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> I recently started doing my own nails and purchased a set of acrylic brushes to practice, but the acrylic would get stuck in the bristles after the second nails. I came across this brush and saw some good reviews and decided to take a chance. I absolutely love this brush and also order a size 6. My nails come out great! I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Rapid delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this brush,  it really keeps it&#x27;s shape !!  It makes applying acrylic super easy!!  My nails look great !!</li>
    <li> My ebay brushes was not the business. I haven&#x27;t used my brushes yet. But from other ladies on YT who has this brush loves it. Plus another nail company sells this exact same brush a few dollars higher without the shipping price and I looked on Amazon before purchasing from the other site and found this exact same brush for a few dollars cheaper with the shipping included. So this was a much better deal. I&#x27;ll be getting the size 10 and 12 next.</li>
    <li> I got a brush that does not look NOTHING like the on in the picture i think i got the wrong one :-( and it does not even work that good</li>
    <li> just as described looks like its good quality</li>
