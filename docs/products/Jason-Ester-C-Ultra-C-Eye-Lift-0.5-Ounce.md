      <li>love the vitamic C face cream, I&#x27;ve been using this particular face cream for over fifteen years with excellent results, so I tried their Ultra-C Eye Lift, Eye Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was quite impressed when she told me how old she was and that she had been using this product for quite sometime, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>It has a nice aroma and seems to be helping to tighten diminish fine lines.</li>

      <li>I see good results and purchasing this product online is reasonable and so easy on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of all of the Jason Ester C products.  </li>
      <li>I really,really enjoy them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>I really,really enjoy them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>This anti-age vitamin C product is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Really smooth and</li>
      <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The line is sold at Whole Foods costing a lot more.</li>
      <li>Love this whole line  -  Jason Ester C  </li>
      <li>worth every penny</li>
      <li>/&gt;Something wasn&#x27;t quite right with the Ultra_C Eye Lift, Eye Treatment</li>
      <li>understand the people react differently to cosmetic products, but how a product marketed as: \\&quot;best and most effective natural products in the marketplace.\\&quot; (quoting Jason&#x27;s website) can bring such a harsh and vile result is beyond me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is another case of a company with established, quality products that has given into the desire for higher profits by using cheaper ingredients and thinking their customers won&#x27;t notice or care.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have really made a difference.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product, but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
      <li>I have a lot to live up to ;D</li>
      <li>Unlike the claims of a certain direct selling company out there, this product really is pure.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more excited and looking younger everyday.</li>
      <li>In my fifties I was faced with the task of trying to find the right facial creams that would help me look as good as I could, but I wanted a product that was natural, minimized fine lines, and didn&#x27;t make me feel guilty about the cost.  </li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this particular Jason product</li>
      <li>So far, as it goes, negativity spreads fast ( i.e my social network accounts....  </li>
      <li>Also the price is good and a very small amount goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I really was enjoying this product until I realized the very small container was empty.  </li>
      <li>, I suppose I&#x27;m rather afraid that I bought \\&quot;Old Stuff,\\&quot; cosmetics that should have been &#x27;tossed&#x27; in good ethics.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>But since it didn&#x27;t last very long, I guess I&#x27;ll never know the long term benefits since I&#x27;m not likely to buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>Only a little is needed and it absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
      <li>I have negletected my 50 year old face to long</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Due to the high levels of Vitamin C, product may darken to a brownish-orange over time.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(my fave \\&quot;store\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m nearly 40 years old and already notice a minimal difference in my skin texture!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love most products that come from Jason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the vitamic C face cream, I&#x27;ve been using this particular face cream for over fifteen years with excellent results, so I tried their Ultra-C Eye Lift, Eye Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something wasn&#x27;t quite right with the Ultra_C Eye Lift, Eye Treatment product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied it to the skin under my eyes, it burned and turned the skin red.  The redness lasted for about fifteen minutes.  I followed the directions so I don&#x27;t know why I had this reaction to the product.  I cannot recommend this particular Jason product but I do recommend the vitamin C face cream made by this company.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Last night I applied the Jason eye cream and within 15min my eyes were on fire. It felt as if I had rubbed in chilly oil. I immediately washed my eyes but the damage was done. Two RED, PUFFY eyes. This morning I had to go to work, and it&#x27;s my birthday thank you, with red, puffy eyes that has started to flake and peel too. I guess I will be enjoying my birthday party tonight in a Halloween costume.&lt;br /&gt;I understand the people react differently to cosmetic products, but how a product marketed as: \\&quot;best and most effective natural products in the marketplace.\\&quot; (quoting Jason&#x27;s website) can bring such a harsh and vile result is beyond me. And I don&#x27;t even have allergic or very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you for pushing products, loaded with harsh chemicals as \\&quot;natural products\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I really was enjoying this product until I realized the very small container was empty.  14 days later.  Now I know that some people have a heavy hand when applying creams. I know better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this cream is that you cannot tell from the little bottle whether or not you are using it all up. You can&#x27;t see inside. That is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work well enough in providing moisture under my eyes without being irritating or smelling bad. But since it didn&#x27;t last very long, I guess I&#x27;ll never know the long term benefits since I&#x27;m not likely to buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Unlike the claims of a certain direct selling company out there, this product really is pure.  This anti-age vitamin C product is fabulous.  It contains no trace of any proven cancer causing agent ( not even as a supposed preservative) and works wonders on the eyes.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> The Very Best of any of the pharmacy of creams I have tried. I also use their Ester C cream. The line is sold at Whole Foods costing a lot more.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Really smooth and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Love this whole line  -  Jason Ester C  worth every penny</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> ...it doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs all the way into the eye area.  After using in the morning and then washing my face in the evening, I feel it being washed away, as if it just hovered over my skin.</li>
    <li> While this product isn&#x27;t as bad as its companion creme, it wasn&#x27;t what I believed I was buying, which was Jason Ester C Eye Serum. This is an inferior product with inferior ingredients. Maybe they&#x27;ve updated the purchase screen&#x27;s picture and description, but it&#x27;s too late for me. I tried to give this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product a chance, but now it&#x27;s too late to return it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another case of a company with established, quality products that has given into the desire for higher profits by using cheaper ingredients and thinking their customers won&#x27;t notice or care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed, and I care.</li>
    <li> One of the best products around for the price!  Before buying expensive lotions off an infomercial, do yourself a favor and consider trying this out.  It is specified for use around the eyes, but it is a wonderful oil-free serum for anywhere you want smoother skin and fewer wrinkles.  And it costs way less.</li>
    <li> In my fifties I was faced with the task of trying to find the right facial creams that would help me look as good as I could, but I wanted a product that was natural, minimized fine lines, and didn&#x27;t make me feel guilty about the cost.  This product was an answer to prayer literally. Only a little is needed and it absorbs into the skin quickly. I see good results and purchasing this product online is reasonable and so easy on Amazon. I never have to go searching at cosmetic counters.  If you are tired of disappointing products, try this.  You won&#x27;t be disppointed.</li>
    <li> Have used this before and it was a syrum instead of a creme. I felt it tightened around the eyes better when it was a syrum.</li>
    <li> Works great Price seems high</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jason skin products for about 10 + years then, ooops, they were gone from ANY local store!!&lt;br /&gt;Odd.  However, I simply could not believe it when I found the products on AMAZON  (my fave \\&quot;store\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m nearly 40 years old and already notice a minimal difference in my skin texture!!  I say \\&quot;minimal\\&quot; because the age process is \\&quot;a process,\\&quot; we all must deal with it.  However, with the Jason  products I am SO satisfied with the results.  I&#x27;ve had Botox (boring, short lasting.....just ridiculous).  My mum, who is 83 years old (no cosmetic surgery -- ever) looks, acts, thinks as one who is half her age! I have a lot to live up to ;D&lt;br /&gt;My mum has been &#x27;borrowing/using&#x27; my products since they arrived and she compares them in the same context as her Chanel products.  Enough said.....wish I could include a photo of mum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay the NEGATIVES:  The products arrived rather LATE...not a huge deal to me as I was kept notified via my mobile.&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing I noticed, all I&#x27;ll I can write this verbatim: \\&quot;Due to the high levels of Vitamin C, product may darken to a brownish-orange over time.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck.  I had my store bought products and they never turned \\&quot;brown.\\&quot;  The consistency of the product, for example, the Ester C Hyper-Serum anti-aging therapy WAS \\&quot;BROWN.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S0 I&#x27;ll have to hunt and search for a  retailer/seller that can provide experation dates on the products: (ALSO, A DIRECTION FOR USE insert was NOT PROVIDED)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, despite my initial excitement over the product (that hasn&#x27;t changed), I suppose I&#x27;m rather afraid that I bought \\&quot;Old Stuff,\\&quot; cosmetics that should have been &#x27;tossed&#x27; in good ethics.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to hear from you.  So far, as it goes, negativity spreads fast ( i.e my social network accounts....  I am a Christian and do not involve myself with gossip.  Just find it strange that my friends keep trying to contact me.  I have nothing to say to them.&lt;br /&gt;As I said earlier in this note, I would simply like to know where/when you purchase the Jason products......I really,really enjoy them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JEANly like to know where/when you purchase the Jason products......I really,really enjoy them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JEAN</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of all of the Jason Ester C products.  They make my face feel instantly fresher and softer.  When I don&#x27;t use my Jason products, I can definitely feel the difference in how my face feels.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using the eye lift lotion for a little over a week. I think my dark circles under my eyes are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I SAW VITAMIN C RECOMMENDED ON THE DR. OZ SHOW.  THOUGHT I&#x27;D TRY THIS PRODUCT WHILE KEEPING IN MIND THAT DIFFERENT PRODUCTS WORK FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.  THIS SURE DID WORK FOR ME...I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product while vacationing in CA. I decided to try it after having a long conversation with a woman about what works and what doesn&#x27;t. I was quite impressed when she told me how old she was and that she had been using this product for quite sometime, so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m fifty one years old and struggle with dark circles around my eyes and loose skin on my upper lid. This product is amazing. It has tightened the skin and my dark circles are fading. I cannot find this product in my area so I hope Amazon keeps carrying it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has a nice aroma and seems to be helping to tighten diminish fine lines. Will re-order! Also the price is good and a very small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Have really made a difference.</li>
    <li> I really am pleased with this product. The lotion has a nice texture and absorbs vety nicely. Ivwould buy this again.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more excited and looking younger everyday. I have negletected my 50 year old face to long but now I am feeling younger and stronger everyday !!!!  Ya Ya Ya</li>
    <li> I like this product for a couple of reasons.....one the smell is great......two is feels great around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was not happy with was the size.....bottle is really small.</li>
</ol>
