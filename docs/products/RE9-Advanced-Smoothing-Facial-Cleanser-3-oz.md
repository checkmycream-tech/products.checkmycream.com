<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  A small amount goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Best face wash I have found! Removes eye makeup too!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s gentle but thorough with cleaning!</li>
    <li> I have loved this facial cleanser since I first tried it several years ago. I regret, however, that the company changed the bottle to a tube. I find it difficult to open and close without wasting the product. The first container had a pump that administered just the correct amount.</li>
    <li> This is s wonderful soothing facial cleanser. Difficult to do without.</li>
    <li> If it is being sold for more than $40....you are paying too much. Get in touch with an independent dealer in your area so you can get it at the fair price. I saw this product being sold for 41.87 when the listed price in an arbonne book is $40!! Don&#x27;t pay more than that! most of the time, an arbonne indepentent dealer with give you their discount too for first time buyers and you will have a loyal consultant for as long as you need them! Such a better idea! Just a heads up ladies and gents!</li>
    <li> Fantastic face wash for a teenage boy too even though it&#x27;s not designed to be used on teenagers. Arbonne has other scrubs for them but it works excellently for my son</li>
    <li> This is truly a great cleanser removes all makeup</li>
    <li> I have been using Arbonne for years and thought i would try buying &amp;#34;off brand&amp;#34; so to speak.  The cleanser packaging and bottle look identical but the product cannot be authentic.  It is too runny, not the same color nor has the same scent.  I have gone back to the original.</li>
    <li> This is the best and only facial cleanser I&#x27;ll use.  It cleans thoroughly and leaves your skin soft, smooth, and hydrated without being oily.  For all skin types.  Arbonne is also one of the few companies left that are cruelty-free.  I use the whole line and it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Very good cleanser.  The whole line is very good.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good product!  Feels so nice when you wash your face.!  Very fresh feel and smell!  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I started using Arbonne products about 2 years ago - I won&#x27;t be without them.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is excellent....it takes off makeup and eye makeup (without burning). It has a very very faint scent...None of their products bother anyone with &#x27;perfume&#x27; issues, etc...&lt;br /&gt;I iused to use the Philosphy famous cleanser but it was actually drying - I didn&#x27;t realize that until I started using this...This is great for sensitive skin since the products are not harmful. Your skin feels like a million bucks after cleansing.</li>
    <li> I love this product, period...a former coworker sold it as a distributor. It is hard to impress me and I liked this product instantly. No animals tested, made in USA and I am thrilled with the results. Out of the kit, I always run out of this first.&lt;br /&gt;Win-Win!!! I will buy this indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars because I like the product, but the new packaging is HORRIBLE. It is impossible to close the tube without getting the cleanser all over the tube and it wastes a lot. The old packaging was great and I have no idea why they changed it. The new packaging is so bad that I probably won&#x27;t buy this anymore and I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial wash!  Glad that I found it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser! Even though its pricey- it lasts forever! Great for removing make up too and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I use this product to wash my face.  It feels smooth, has a delicate fragrance and my skin feels clean.</li>
    <li> I recieved my purchase within four days and enclosed were extra &#x27;sample&#x27; products.  Great price and great service. I will order again from this person.</li>
    <li> If you have not tried the Arbonne products, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing. It is expensive, BUT SO WORTH IT!! First, within a couple of weeks your skin is so smooth and wrinkles are disappearing. It provides moisture lost with aging. It is all natural, no chemicals to cause allergies which is why I tried it to begin with. I have used it for 4 years now and was so happy to find it on Amazon&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this line, my skin has made a complete turn around. It eliminated a rash that I had on my face for six months. I had tried EVERYTHING else, and this is the only thing that worked. My skin also looks and feels a million times cleaner and clearer.</li>
    <li> I received some samples of this line to test for a friend who sells Arbonne. I was happy to try new skincare products but did not expect the line to do anything. I used the cleanser, toner, day cream, serum, and under eye cream for about 2 weeks and was amazed at how good my skin looked. I&#x27;m almost 39 with fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes, and I have very fair skin that tends to get blotchy from time to time, especially in the winter. After only a few days my skin started to look clearer, healthier, more moisturized and more even toned. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the number of products I was using, because I often don&#x27;t have much time for my skin care routine. I took one star off because I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product. It&#x27;s not terrible, just not particularly pleasant to me. I have no idea how this product would work on its own since I used the whole line together, but I am will continue to buy this product, along with a few of the others in the line, since I&#x27;ve noticed my skin revert back to looking tired and blotchy since I&#x27;ve finished using up the samples.</li>
    <li> I have tried many skin care products but Arbonne is the one I constantly return to!  I like the way my skin feels after using this cleanser. My skin feels hydrated, soft and clean.  No other cleanser has worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;People have noticed the difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance when I use the entire product line!  I am not the most diligent with skin care but I do use the cleanser religiously.&lt;br /&gt;Another important comment for all the animal lovers out there...&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS LISTED ON PETA&#x27;S LIST AS CRUELTY FREE.  This means no animal products and no animal testing.  It is also a Mall Partner meaning that it gives donations to Animal Rescue organizations!</li>
    <li> I bought Arrbonne several years ago. Other products are not effective as Arrbonne. I have dry skin and my skin feels so much better with the use of Arrbonne. This product helps the dry itchy skin left after using inferior products</li>
    <li> The RE9 smoothing facial cleanser is wonderful!  The scent is citrusy, and therefore smells super clean!  I use it at night along with my cleansing brush, and I&#x27;m so happy with the results.  I&#x27;m 63 and feel that my skin looks pretty decent.  Others seem to think so as well. I also want to state that I ordered this cleanser on 10/29/13.  I happily received it on 11/1/13.  The price is fair, and the seller is terrific!  Wonderful experience all the way around.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;It helps people who have very dry or sensitive skin.  It is worth the price paid for what you get</li>
    <li> this is the 1st time i have been dissatisfied.  The product seems altered. Smells different and is not the usual Arbonne pearl color. Has irritated my face. Will not buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> One squirt is plenty to take off makeup, mascara and anything else.  This cleanser leaves my face feeling moisturized and not dried out like many other cleansers do.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser!! I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the very few products out there that does not irritate my skin, or overly dry it out. Great stuff would like to buy it in bucketfuls if I could...</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Very light--non-greasy</li>
    <li> The packaging was all smashed and looked like it had been in someones purse for months...Live and learn I will only purchase from Arbounne directly, this way I&#x27;ll be sure its the real stuff...I threw this in the trash, so lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I have used RE9 for several years.  The face wash is okay but not good for moderate to oily skin types.  While using RE9 products (all of them), I noticed my face breaking out after I started using it.  I finally decided after several years to look for new facial products.  I have switched products to a new manufacturer and my face has cleared up and looks healthier.  For the amount you pay for Arbonne RE9, it was okay.  You can find other facial products at similar cost that are much better.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It glides on your skin to gently cleanse and it smells so good!  It&#x27;s expensive, but, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Arbonne and will continue to use Arbonne.  I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.  Good thing for Prime!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne for a couple years now &amp; absolutely love it! My skin is amazing!!! However, this order of cleanser is watered down. Won&#x27;t buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Have bought this product from an arbonne rep before... Thought id save time and buy on amazon. Big mistake! Pump on bottle won&#x27;t work... Open it up and product is overly thick and smells weird. Disappointed that I wasted my money on something fake. Don&#x27;t do the same.</li>
    <li> I love this creamy, luscious cleanser. I feel like I am pampering my face every time I use it! Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Last bottle ran out!  Love the product!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and I really enjoy the light citrus smell.  But, I would NOT buy from Amazon. There are so many people that had issues with the products they received. Order straight through an Arbonne rep. Not only can they get you a better price, but you get a 45 Money Back Guarantee.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and with great scented bath salt sample! Def will reorder from this... Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I received the day cream instead of the cleanser when I ordered the cleanser. Annoying to have to return it.</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne. They are pricey but are worth the money if you can afford it. I am hooked on the RE9 Advanced Line. I normally order directly through Arbonne, but once they have applied tax and shipping, things can get super costly. Thankfully with Amazon Prime...free shipping!!! One less thing to pay for.</li>
    <li> Tried other product but like this the most.  Leaves my skin so smooth and helps keep it soft and clean</li>
    <li> This is by far the very best retinol product I have ever used. I have seen smooth and even results in just one week!</li>
    <li> does a wonderful job and leaves my skin healthy and smooth.  have never used any product that works this well</li>
    <li> This product is, in my opinion, an improvement on the original.  I had seen other reviews that discount the packaging since the original pump was easier to use, however, this was only true until the product started to run out and the pump stopped working (with plenty of product left in the bottle).  This packaging is much better and the cleanser is light on the skin and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This product was leaking when I received it - part of the cleanser was all over the plastic bag it was in, the cap was not closed tight at all. I actually doubt this product is true Arbonne - smells like soap to me. I think for the future it is worth it to pay extra and buy the product from distributor and not online as you never know what you get.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery! Satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> excellent product, like the consistency and results</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser from sales through my friend....Ive been using it everyday since november..I never thought i would love it this much....my skin type is combination..i always choose foam cleanser .eg.i used to use origin balance....lancome foam cleaner.because its easy to rinse off all the residue...and my skin is very sensitive....this cleanser is the best so far...LOVE LOVE it</li>
    <li> Okay, pricey and feels waxy on my skin</li>
    <li> Great facial soap - my complexion is best when I use this brand.</li>
    <li> Others have reviewed this and said it is a tube - but it&#x27;s not. I didn&#x27;t notice how old those reviews were but the company has changed the RE9 line and the cleanser is in a pump bottle again. The picture amazon gives is accurate. As one reviewer mentioned the price on here is a little bit more than what the company sells it for on their website however, if you have free prime shipping it&#x27;s still cheaper AND you get it much faster!</li>
    <li> Arbonne is my choice of facial cleanser...I have used this product for 10 plus years.... The product is bit on the pricey side but I still love it....</li>
    <li> Smells great !  But it made my face start breaking out.  I should have known that even after 50 years I can&#x27;t use anything not specifically marked non-comedegenic (or whatever the spelling is.)</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as advertised and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This cleanser works well on my face and I find that a bottle lasts a long time, so it is worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne for years and this is not it. It still clean my face and takes the makeup off so I didn&#x27;t return it, I just will not buy it on amazon again.</li>
    <li> I used the RE 9 products for years!  Then I started using other brands to save money!  My skin never looked better when I was using that line..I am 46 and will be going back to it!</li>
    <li> Bought this product and put on shelf until I needed to use it. This product was not RE9 facial Cleanser by Arbonne. I had some  left in my bottle  that I purchased from Arbonne directly. The product I got from  amazon is a fake. It was runny, left  a residue and when rubbed on dry skin  it turned white. The real product rubbed on a dry arm was clear  and  the product was thicker.I would like to  get my money back..</li>
    <li> Love these products!  I have been using them for two years faithfully and see a huge improvement in my skin.  So does the woman that does my facials.  Highly recommend RE9 to anyone over 40!</li>
    <li> cleanser works great....</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used for my face.  I have extremely sensitive skin and Arbonne RE9 does not irritate it and it takes some of the redness out.  Would highly recommend this cleanser to anyone that has skin problems.  Does not feel greasy either.  Your skin feels cleansed.</li>
    <li> Have been nusing Arbonne products since my girlfriend made me go to one of her shows. Best show  I ever went to. I am 46 years old and people still think i am in my early 30&#x27;s. My skin has never felt or looked better. I know it&#x27;s a little pricy but its well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and it is a d-r-a-g -- so many products, even those targeted for sensitive skin, make my face burn and turn red. I am very fair and use a physical-based sunscreen (Skinceuticals) because it doesn&#x27;t redden my skin. I&#x27;m 44 and truthfully, I am so tired of kissing frogs which, more often than not, do NOT turn out to be gentle-to-my-skin princes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While shopping at the mall I met a local Arbonne rep who gave me Re9 samples and I fell in love with the cleanser (and the eye cream) -- but I could never get ahold of that rep, so I turned to Amazon (of course). I purchased it from ladybug2play and it was a superb transaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back to the cleanser: I love how it smells (fresh and of oranges); I love how easy and efficient the pump top is (not at all messy); I love how it removes everything, including my eyeliner / mascara; I love how my face has not once ever felt inflamed and not once has it ever been reddened by using it. My skin feels smooth and I know it&#x27;s clean, plus it feels clean (you know how there are some products which do clean but you&#x27;re still left with an icky feeling on your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, of course, is that it is gentle on my skin while doing what it&#x27;s promised: smoothed and cleaned my face.</li>
    <li> Faster than buying it through a rep.  Fabulous cleanser.  Leaves your skin feeling amazing!  It was a good price too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Arbonne for years and love it.  I bought online since my usual consultant stopped selling the product and I am 100% sure this product has been watered down.  The soap is usually creamy and pearlescent, this bottle was 1/4 empty and full of watery bubbles.  So fraudulent!  You get what you pay for, save yourself the headache and buy directly from Arbonne.com!!!  I will be letting Arbonne know you are selling tampered product!</li>
    <li> The only products I use, love how they work!</li>
    <li> A great, natural cleansing product for my extra-sensitive skin. A tiny bit goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve bought this three times over the past two years. The shipping time was way too long (three weeks).</li>
    <li> LOVE Arbonne.  I also love this cleanser.  It makes your face feel so clean and fresh.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a decent price. Cheaper than the Arbonne site. The item arrived quickly and the description was accurate. I like the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a long line of facial cleansers that worked &#x27;OK&#x27;. This is the first cleanser that has worked great for my sensitive skin. It never irritates my skin and cleans without overly drying. I love that Arbonne uses more natural ingredients for their product than most companies - my skin can tell the difference!</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing through Arbonne RE9 for a long time, the face wash I recently purchased seems different... not as pleased with the product as I have been in the past.  Formula change???</li>
    <li> I love my Arbonne cleanser!  It cleans without stripping and leaves my face feeling refreshed.  Worth the purchase....you&#x27;ll get addicted.</li>
    <li> My face feels very soft and smooth after using it. It&#x27;s the best face cleanser I have ever used. Love it.</li>
    <li> I used this cleanser after a friend recommended it and my face got all red and bumpy right after. I will be going back to using Aveno, this stuff might be natural but it has many toxic chemicals in it. At the hefty price of this products, I&#x27;d expect excellent performance, not $1 store hit or miss.&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY!</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne products and have been using them for a few years.  I am 47 years old and people can&#x27;t believe it because my skin looks so young.  I use the entire line and even using it every day, this product will last at least 6 months.  This is a very creamy, rich cleanser and a little goes a long way.  I love the smell and I feel very refreshed after using it.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product at an Arbonne party.  It made my skin wonderful and so I finally decided to spend the money on a full size bottle.  It is well worth it and you only need a very small amount so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Received promptly. Great product!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant paying this much for a cleanser, so a representative sent me a sample pack.  And I liked the orange fragrance and how little was needed, but I still wasn&#x27;t sold. When I went back to my regular regime of simple soap and water, I was sold.The difference was night and day.  My tube has lasted...about 4 months. Well worth the cost! And my breakouts and practically gone!</li>
    <li> Amazing results.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but worth it. Lesves skin feeling soft and clean. I rarely spend $$ on beauty products, but this is an exception. It doesn&#x27;t leave skin oily or dry.its the only one I use.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  It makes your face feel smooth, refreshed, and clean, without drying your skin.  It cleans without residue.</li>
    <li> All of the Arbonne products are great.  This facial cleanser suds up so beautifully yet does not leave your skin feeling dry or tight... just smooth and silky.  I love it, love it.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and does a good job removing eye makeup.  The only issue is the cost--if it were more reasonably priced I would rate it five stars!</li>
