<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> kuro sumi is always known for its quality. great seller</li>
    <li> not my favorite ink but a classic all preference . Seller did there part just fine</li>
    <li> Great ink for outlining, and tribal tattoos.  Its not real thick, but it flows fine and stays good.  Also easy to make your own greywash with. I will always buy from this seller as they are prompt and easy to contact with a question.  Respectfully Hawk.</li>
    <li> This is probably the BEST black Tattoo ink on the market...it really IS black...goes in that way and doesn&#x27;t fade to blue like some black inks do.</li>
    <li> I will by from again fast shipping good product and low price. i Cant ask for more. I will return over and over for this item A+</li>
    <li> I have been using this ink for a quite a long time. It works really well. It&#x27;s a lot of ink for the price.</li>
    <li> Arrived a day early, everything in order. A+</li>
    <li> Love it really dark blak ink</li>
    <li> This stuff flys in and stays dark im new to tattooing learn useing soot and ive used a bunch of outher brands trying to find a good vibrant black that goes in even and heals well and so far this ink is the absolute best and if your reading thiss trying to make a decision dont buy crazy horse tattoo ink it is horrible</li>
    <li> I bought this ink in the past and one time it did leak but I fixed the problembut besides that the ink is great. Its the best I&#x27;ve used so far in my years of tattooing, really worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this ink. It has a very deep black and will not fade away as some of the cheaper inks do, I would highly recommend it to tattoo artist of all levels</li>
    <li> Good Ink not like others that are like working with thick paste.  This one runs clean and smooth thru the tips and doesnt clot. like others.</li>
    <li> Great ink, goes in solid and smooth, only ink that I will ever line with.  Best rep in the business..</li>
    <li> this Ink last long it is a great product</li>
    <li> I love this ink. It says it is for outlines but it is awesome for filling in too. I love how dark it is and that it stays dark. If it fades at all it is not enough to notice. And I get it within a week every time I order.</li>
    <li> Product came as described</li>
    <li> Terrible ink! Does not stay. Flakes bad. Will never purchase this ink again!</li>
    <li> Used it on myself  its ok but i like the darkness of the ink doesn&#x27;t  fade to blue</li>
    <li> works great and doesn&#x27;t fade. I used it tattooing my rabbits for shows.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color that seems to last and last and last. I will never use another kind of black tattoo ink in my life, be it my own tattoos or a tattoo on another person. It is simply the best black ink I have ever used. I can not say enough how much I like it. It&#x27;s dark enough to keep a black pigment for a long time, but it&#x27;s easy enough to clean off without struggling to get those smears off (as long as you have some decent green soap)</li>
    <li> Love this ink best ink for outlining</li>
    <li> I really like the ink and would of gave it 5 stars if the cover for the bottle didn&#x27;t leak all over the place. I had to put it in a different bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch of ink. But this was the worst outlining I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I have used Kuro before and loved it. But I think this ink was thinner than water. It made the outline blotchy and scratchy and didn&#x27;t stick at all.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Will be buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Love this ink!  So far and so good.  Stays where you put it.  Love line tattoos so much that my whole left arm is covered.  Have been using this black ink on myself and I love it.  The seller is fantastic and my purchase of ink arrived days before estimatied arrival date.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come out that good. It looks more like a light grey. But that was on pigskin. On human skin it turned out deep black so I ordered 5 more bottles and they just came in</li>
    <li> Kuro Sumi is a very good ink,Im new at this tattoo hobby but I can tell a good product performance and good service,most of the guys at the tattoo shop that I use to hang out used Kuro Sumi black outlining tattoo ink,Im happy with this product and service,were planning to use them again in the future...</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time the other night. It has a perfect consistency. It&#x27;s not to thin and not to thick. The price is reasonable as well. This is only ink that I will use for outlining from now on.</li>
    <li> wonderful outlining ink, but it&#x27;s very dark and thick so don&#x27;t use it to shade unless you water it down or go a lot lighter</li>
    <li> Its value fir your money and tge delivery was fast&amp;#34; highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The ink goes in dark and works very well. This is really good for covering other tattoos, thanks for the good deal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ink for a year now and I love it and so do my clients. 99% of the tattoos that I&#x27;ve done using this ink look as if I just tattooed them. I&#x27;ve only had a few occurrences where the ink would not hold at all but then again those people told me they had been drinking the night before. This ink also works great as gray wash mixed with witch hazel. Product shipped super fast as always. Great Seller.</li>
    <li> Amazing Ink you will love the black!</li>
    <li> this ink was like an orgasm to the eyes, it was great. the ink did exactly what i wanted it to, the way i wanted it to... it is great i would recommend this item to anybody doing a tatoo...</li>
    <li> I would like to start by saying that the shipping was extremely fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for the Kuro Sumi outlining ink, this ink is on of the best. The consistency is perfect and won&#x27;t start to gum the machine when using straight black ink (non graywash) as other inks do. This is by far my favorite ink brands due to the quality and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you buy it you won&#x27;t regret it. It&#x27;ll be a matter of how it stacks to other favorites that you might already have.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how much there is to say about this ink, but I did a piece on myself with it using a handheld needle. Six months later, it still looks fine and professionally done like the day I got it. Very easy to work with, as well. Highly recommended.  As a plus, the bottle is easy to pour and doesn&#x27;t make a mess every single time I open it, unlike some other bottles that are poorly designed.</li>
    <li> I bought this ink for my son who is in a tattoo artist internship.  He has been pleased with it.</li>
    <li> exactly what its suppose to be. satisfied!</li>
    <li> i used it and i have to go over the line that i am tattooing 2 times cause its not thick it is soup bad</li>
    <li> The ink is a bit thin but goes in well and stays dark.  Good overall product and seller.  Stay Gold my friends!</li>
    <li> thanx guys really happy with this ink..good quality ink first line it stays perfectly n very dark...very pleased will b buyin more ink from you guys soon.....</li>
    <li> Great black ink. It&#x27;s really dark and goes in great and smooth. Also fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Will order again! Great for outlining. I did try to use it for shading; if you don&#x27;t have a huge area to shade, it works fine. If you&#x27;re looking for a dark/large shade, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> ink is great for both lining and shading but I&#x27;m a mobile artist and the bottle tends to leak if ur not very careful i have to keep a glove wrapped around it so that it doesn&#x27;t leak into my kit..</li>
    <li> This ink is amazon ... I&#x27;m glad I got this kinda ink instead of the or he ink I was gone get but I everything is str8 I recommend this ink to buy</li>
    <li> This ink if fantastic, stuck BLACK on the first pass and STAYED BLACK. Seriously amazed me switching to this and seeing a finished product as black as the day it went in.</li>
    <li> came days earlier then it was suppose to good ink to the best you&#x27;ll find at a low price great stuff</li>
    <li> The ink is great. It works amazingly. It goes in the skin very nicely. I&#x27;ve Ink&#x27;d my brother and his friend so far, and it&#x27;s honestly one of the best inks I&#x27;ve tried so far. I love this ink. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Best Outlining Ink on the market, in my opinion. I use it exclusively for all my lining and shading/greywash jobs. Kuro Sumi for life!!!</li>
    <li> The best ink I have purchased if you like you tattoo to stay black without fading this is the stuff you want</li>
    <li> Did not like this ink very water down and does not stay in the skin very well</li>
    <li> By far the best BLACK tattoo ink I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s true black when you use it and stays that way after healing, very very impressed.</li>
    <li> My favorite ink! Good quality and always my favorite product!</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and I got what I wanted. The pigment is really super dark like promised. The only problem is the bottle tends to leak around the lid and nozzle.</li>
    <li> Happy with ink. Second time I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get to use, but heard good things back from the gift.</li>
    <li> Too thin, and watery. Does not set up well, and requires way more passes to get a good line. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> i purchased this outlining ink and its by far the best ive used for tattooing. i&#x27;ve used some other brands which resulted in poor quality tattooes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different ones and I think this one is the best for sure. Great quality, goes in to the skin beautifully. I mix it with witch hazel to make some nice greyshades too.</li>
    <li> Very dark ink , good flow through machine. Great value !! Will buy again , All of my clients were amazed at the darkness this ink brings</li>
    <li> Kuro  sumi inks are by far my favorite inks. I  love the way this ink looks. Coverage is always beyond expectation. Excellent as an liner. Works great for shading also.</li>
    <li> This stuff came really quick tried it on myself it seams to ne kinda watery and have to go over it a couple times but U do like how dark it is and am going to keep being to work with it. Ps. The bottle is crab leaks.</li>
    <li> The screw on nozzle that lets you put the ink in cups has a leak! I tried to pour myself some ink and it got all over the place, the ink was good quality, I just wish the nozzle was better, if you buy this product I would recommend getting a nozzle from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Product is great exactly as described, took a little time to get here during to weather</li>
    <li> This is a great outlining ink! It also mixes back nicely for shading, and I have had great results doing fill in work as well. For the price, this is the best black I&#x27;ve found for outline work and nice dense black all around.</li>
    <li> Came in quicker than thought deep color</li>
    <li> Best tattoo ink! Doesn&#x27;t bleed into your skin. Best quality I&#x27;ve come across! :)</li>
    <li> All my customers demand the best &amp; that is what I provide for them. KURO SUMI Tattoo ink is hi-def &amp; out standing to other inks. This ink has color depth &amp; lends itself to great shading. pure &amp; clean, just one day healing on all my customers.</li>
    <li> Great ink. The other reviews ring true. It stays wet for as long as you need and goes into the skin well.</li>
    <li> good price, shipped quick.  Goes in the skin very black.  Nice sized bottle that will last for a while.  I wold buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of high dollar ink and none have even come close to the kuro I&#x27;m not easily impressed but I&#x27;m  sold 100% it go&#x27;s in effortlessly and stays dark long after the tattoo has healed this company sales the real deal it&#x27;s real kuro not a cheep knock off and 100% safe and led free you would be a fool to pass it up why mess with the rest when you can have the best&lt;br /&gt;The line ink works great with any size round line or shader&lt;br /&gt;for mags get the shade ink it&#x27;s a little thicker and picks up nicely</li>
    <li> Some of the best lining and shading ink i have used so far. Does fairly well with washing to . But i use witch hazel for the mix.</li>
    <li> Got what was expected</li>
    <li> Great item and fast shipping</li>
    <li> it goes in smooth dark and not pushing out. i love it. i will order this time and time again.</li>
    <li> Was fake counterfeit took to 2 diffrent tattoo shops they also said not real quality was deff fake would not use on human flesh.</li>
    <li> This ink is no good I want a refund I don&#x27;t recommend this ink to no one</li>
    <li> Very fast service great product</li>
    <li> It works just as it should and better than any other outlining ink I&#x27;ve used. Will buy more when running low</li>
    <li> The skin takes the ink very well and stayes bold and bright after the tattoo is weeks old and healed</li>
    <li> The ink it&#x27;s self is great. Solid and pretty easy to sink. Just the bottle&#x27;s nozzle has difficulty flowing smoothly. I recommend the ink but also recommend getting 1oz i ink bottles to put it in.</li>
    <li> love this ink. Doesnt turn blue. Black as black gets. If u wanna prison style peice go stab somebody and earn your ink like the rest of us. Take ur booboo ass to somebody else</li>
    <li> Best black you can buy. Its black and stays black, no blue tint like other black inks</li>
    <li> works good its smooth .. its a little watery it sprays out the tip if your not paying attention but besides that flawless in my opinion</li>
    <li> good stuff, I&#x27;d put it in my body</li>
    <li> Best black tattoo ink I ever used.I highly recommend it!</li>

    <li> Love this ink stays black goes in smooth</li>
    <li> this ink is amazing for outlining and for the price too  i have used it over and over already not just hreat for outlines but fills in nice too</li>

    <li> Good value for the money, the ink is very dark, it has a good quantity of it and it will work well.for tattoing. The package can be better but you can always put the ink in more comfortable dispensers.</li>
    <li> Sticks very well, a lot of pigment</li>

    <li> I do all my own tatts. I tried out different inks an they all kinda not black no more. They like a blue tone to them. I ordered this ink an after months now it still looks as if I just did them about a week ago. So vibrant an just right for dark skin toned people it shows up better. So I ended up gripping through the pain of redoing all my tarts over with this ink an now people notice them a lot more. Always getting compliments. I have 18 by the way. (They are all coverable lol)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good ink, goes in well, the only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is because it does not come out black like is advertised its more of a Navy Blue</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I trust this ink. Me and my husband tried this ink and it completely rejected. We tried black buddha and it was so much better. Now we have a whole bottle that won&#x27;t be used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this ink over and over. I&#x27;ve tried others, but keep coming back to this one. I&#x27;ve never had a client have a reaction to it, and its not messy. This ink stays in the skin very well. The packaging was excellent! I recommend this product to many!</li>
    <li> Worst ink iv ever used go with something else</li>
    <li> This ink so so pigmented and you don&#x27;t scab as much like cheap ink. I can&#x27;t wait to try this brands colored ink : )!</li>
    <li> love my Kuro Sumi ink it does its job</li>
    <li> I like this ink, it is dark and a good consistency. Preformed well.</li>
    <li> Nice ink for a good price!</li>
    <li> One word; beautiful. Yes, its less viscous so that you can make clean passes. And it works.</li>
    <li> i love it, it goes in very well, dark enough to do cover up, no irritation and no side affect</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and a great price</li>
    <li> If your looking for &amp;#34;True black ink&amp;#34;, look no further, this stuff is pure , rich black.  It is a little bit on the runny side, but goes right in and stays.  Tats come out nice and black and don&#x27;t fade.  I use this all the time for outlining, and works great.</li>
    <li> He loves it because it&#x27;s not cheap stuff and he said it doesn&#x27;t fade like other blacks.  I personally have no experience with it.</li>
    <li> NIce  ink goes in easily goes in dark. Excellent for making black and grey. Start with 50% ink 50% water. That will be your Very Dark. Thin it 4 more times from there and youll get  very nice black and grey tones!!</li>
    <li> very dark and holds great</li>
    <li> I definitely got what I paid for here.  I really like this brand of ink.  I will purchase this again.  The cost was very great too.</li>
    <li> The product worked well. Had lots of compliments about it. Would recamend to others to get.. will reorder again soon</li>
    <li> This ink is kind of thin for most people but it is the perfect ink for lining and all black shading wich makes it perfect if you&#x27;re into tribals</li>
    <li> Good Quality Ink, Doesnt bleed a lot, stays in the tube. Will be buying more Kuro Sumi Inks. They come in colors too</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend, it look great on dark skin. He&#x27;s only used it a few time but it heals nicely.</li>
    <li> Came exactly how it appears nice doing work with you will shop with you again keep up the good work very outstanding</li>
    <li> And its good ink-&lt;br /&gt;outlines dark and vibrant.  Will more than likely pick up more Kuro Sumi in the future.</li>
    <li> I refuse to use any other black ink! I love kuro sumi so much, it comes out so bold and black. Looks like it will never fade! Amazing ink and it was real (not fake ink). Will purchase again as soon as I run low!</li>
    <li> The ink was a little thin</li>
    <li> First of all the shipping was faster than the time they said.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the ink is excellent it gets in pretty easy and very dark! I totally buy it again it&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
    <li> this ink is amazing. flows in very good, it goes in dark and it stays dark plus for me it heals pretty fast.has a good consistency and i believe its 100% real. and if it isnt then this is a damn good fake. its got the right label, the right pigment numbers and the embossed emblem on the neck. plus the shipping was really fast it took like 3 days .i love piercing pros best prices and good service deff order from them.</li>
    <li> Great ink color doesn&#x27;t fade I honestly don&#x27;t like using anything but kuro sumi</li>
    <li> Just got it today it really watery and not sure why I have never had it like that befor and I have used this brand for awhile</li>
    <li> Great Line Ink.Great Product!  Just what the artist wanted.</li>
    <li> too watery and thin, black is decent</li>
    <li> Ink works great not watery. Will be buying more inks from this brand and from piercing pros.no hassles no bull.</li>
    <li> I so needed this big bottle. Wish they would make it in a bigger one so i can do more tats with black then jus the out lineing.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is tops. Beautiful crisp blacks. Arrived to my house quickly.  Very satisfied with the results it provided. :)</li>
    <li> The greatest outlining ink ive ever used, super speedy delivery. thx</li>
    <li> One of the darkest and natural shining black ink u can get</li>
    <li> I havnt been tattooing long enough to have used every ink on the market, but I have used a lot of \\&quot;top of line&#x27;&#x27; inks that cost twice as much with twice the hassel going in. This is a true single pass ink. The only one for me. Peircing pros jus amazing company. Fast delivery and since iv bought a lot of their products I still don&#x27;t know bout their customer service because iv never needed to. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very nice and dark black. stays dark after healed,goes in smooth. Very happy with this ink. Will buy again. 20 words needed. Blah blah blah.</li>
    <li> Awesome ink, just perfect for really really colourfull tattoos, the item was well packaged, no inconvenients at all. I recomend this to begginers, interediates or professionals</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend and he loves it. Says it is the best ink available and I thought it was a great price. Service and delivery was great and will use them again.</li>
    <li> Its leaked out of the bottle cause I had a crack in the side of the bottle it should of been packed better so I really cant tell you if the ink was any good or not</li>
    <li> just don&#x27;t like it to me doesn&#x27;t stick good at all to skin</li>
    <li> Sticks great love this ink</li>
    <li> the outlining ink is awesome and dark as hell and stays dark over time you wont have to touch it up a few years from now bc it faded this s*** stays black</li>
    <li> Good quality. Tattoos look great</li>
    <li> This ink is awesome but I&#x27;m sure that a lot of people know this but I&#x27;m a first time tattoos I&#x27;ll love that it stays in the skin thank you</li>
    <li> i fell in love with this ink when i first got it because when i first started i was using kokkai sumi because of it was made for tribal but i had no idea  it was crap compared to this this is a one pass and it handles its job but unfortunately the darker the skin the harder it will be to make the lines really stand out but don&#x27;t get me wrong ive tatted a lot of dark skins with this ink and it shows up clean its not bad quality but if you want a bold dark line in ink on dark skin i would prefer Waverley or dynamic but over all this is some top knotch ink if your going on lighter skin or some thats a few shades away from dark</li>
    <li> Kuro Sumi always delivers the quality my customers look for and is the only company I trust for tattoo ink personally. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent item... exactaly as discribed</li>
    <li> Not the first time I bought ink from here. The ink is just right to go into the skin smoothly. Crisp dark lines.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Stayed in skin perfectly:)!</li>
    <li> Best ink ever. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> beautifully dark. perfect outlining ink, GREAT price esp for the size. even works well for shading. my go-to black ink.</li>
    <li> just what is was supposed to be</li>
    <li> The best black ink I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great ink. Supdised hiw fast i got it</li>
    <li> This ink is great, I always use this kind and I really love it.  I will buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> have used it for outlining and coloring tribal works and stays. will purchase again wondering if the other color inks are as good</li>
    <li> Excellent pigment for both lining and shading, will definitely be ordering this again. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like the ink. The other black in I had was thick and seemed to dry a little quicker ...</li>
    <li> honestly was skeptical but it arrived days before suggested and the product is wonderful. ink is bold and very sterile when it arrives</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Kuro Sumi for a while and it&#x27;s worked wonders.  Ink has changed in years of tattooing and kuro sumi has kept up and made me a return buyer many times.</li>
    <li> i choose this rating because of two things! The quickness of the arrival and the product quailty is amazing it holds well in the skin</li>
    <li> real nice ink. some inks when they splat outta the machine just stay on top of the skin but this ink finds its way into where u just tattooed! very black.</li>
    <li> Great ink, definitely a great deal!</li>
    <li> color turns out black and not blue like some, a lot of ink for the money</li>
    <li> Ink was thin and didnt stay in the skin</li>
    <li> i love it the ink works great on the tattoo and last long</li>
    <li> A rich fine ink for lining our shade</li>
    <li> havnt opened yet , but going by the holographic logo on the bottle assume its authentic so should be good stuff</li>
    <li> When my product arrived, the bottle was covered with black ink. I removed the plastic cover searching for a leak thinking maybe the bottle got damaged during delivery. I didn&#x27;t find any so I removed the cap and found that the seal was broke. It was truly disappointing. I was very anxious to try this ink out.</li>
    <li> great ink,have tried others from other companies.they take up to a week to deliver</li>
    <li> Bad Ass INK Love It,,,you all need to get to some today this ink. I used in shop a love how black it stays in skin.</li>
    <li> some of the best outlining ink i have ever used, deep dark black in one pass very good ink recommended</li>
    <li> Kuro Sumi is very good outlining ink but there are others that are better.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on really really black.  I also use it to shade.  Its almost as dark as a black sharpie tattoo - the end result almost looks drawn on its that dark!</li>
    <li> Great solid dark outlining.</li>
    <li> I give it five stars because it is good quality for a decent price..the ink itself goes in easy, and holds dark.not to mention that I got my ink quicker than the estimated time.I recommend this ink to anyone who wants quality ink at a decent price..</li>
    <li> it is what it is its ink so what can i do or say about it. It is of a good consintrate it is the black  and same way  a liner&lt;br /&gt;Ink is suppose to</li>
    <li> The product arived a day earlier than projected and was exactly what the vender had said it was. I&#x27;m very happy with this experience !</li>
    <li> great product exactly as described the quality is perfect with no manufactureing defects, i recomend this product based on price to quality,  QUALITY WHITETRASH SPECIAL</li>
    <li> exactly as described. I&#x27;ve used many different brands and to me in my opinion this is the darkest and easiest to apply in the skin. Been using it for almost 10 years.</li>
    <li> The color is great and saturates! Looking for a great lines use this ink to outline tattoos for the best result!</li>
    <li> Great ink! Will continue to use this brand for all my tattooing inks!</li>
    <li> works great have done a few tattoos with it and the black stayed awesome!</li>
    <li> This also was a gift, seemed to be happy to have it, I informed him of the reviews that were unhappy with the tip for the bottle</li>
    <li> I did lots of research and this ink kept coming up as one of the best. I did a tattoo on my stomach with this ink several days ago. Its already healed and very black. I will buy this ink again and recommend to anyone looking for super black ink.</li>
    <li> good deal on the ink. arrived on time. this is the very best tattoo ink. i only use Kuro Sumi</li>
    <li> Works really well stays in skin dark black good product</li>
    <li> Ink didnt stay in any of my customers skin. I&#x27;m highly disappointed</li>
    <li> this is by far the best outlining n shading ink out there,i would highly recomend this ink to anyone who does tattoo work</li>
    <li> Love the new ink can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> other than the top of the squeeze tip popping off once, this ink is perfectly black, sticks very well, and is perfect for anybody who needs affordable black ink.</li>
    <li> it got here safe and sound and no problem with it, I would surly would need to pay more in the future</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thin but so far the black is still pretty dark.</li>
    <li> This is a superior ink; leaves a very solid black line in the skin. Compared to other blacks, this is excellent; makes the other inks look pale.  Very satisfied with the Kuro Sumi ink.</li>
    <li> Great ink for any tattooing; stick and poke, etc.  I do wish it came in two separate smaller bottles so I can make sure the ink doesn&#x27;t dry, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  It&#x27;s dark for sure!  I used separate bottles to keep the ink stored after opening just in case.</li>
    <li> Got here on time like said and worked out great thanks I will be purchasing from kuro sumi often best purchase ever</li>
    <li> This ink is one of the best I have found for outlines and shading you can never go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> A+ Piercing Pro&#x60;s are the best. All way&#x60;s on time the price is the best on line WILL buy again.</li>
    <li> this ink is dark. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so i&#x27;m still waiting to see how it holds up. Other than that it came quickly and with no issues</li>
    <li> I love this ink for lining, makes a great grey wash when mixed with witch hazel.</li>
    <li> FAST SERVICE AND GOOD INK JUST LIKE IN THE REVIEWS BY OTHER CUSTOMERS VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND VERY GOOD SERVICE</li>
    <li> Awesome dark ink, use it everyday!</li>
    <li> this ink is my preferred one for outline, I tried to use it as a grey wash by diluting it in distilled water or witch hazel, but it does not take really well in the skin.</li>
    <li> this is very good ink stays nice and dark</li>
    <li> All around the best tattoo ink on the market today. Anyone who wants dark easy to use ink this is the only ink i recomend</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work out right. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this ink. Won&#x27;t be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
