      <li>Excellent product</li>
      <li>It is very good for women who have 4b/4c hair like me.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great for waves and to soften your hair...</li>
      <li>this carrot cream works great with the hair roots, they helped strengthen and deepen my 360 waves.</li>
      <li>This product is great for transitioning hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great product but</li>
      <li>ITS A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I LOVE CARROT CREME!!</li>
      <li>REALLY GOOD HOLD LEAVES THE HAIR</li>
      <li>If they do, I&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>Best when used right after a shower, no conditioner needed.</li>
      <li>I also love the smell!</li>
      <li>I would have liked it better if there were more oils in it.</li>
      <li>It was okay for me.</li>
      <li>One more styling tip.</li>
      <li>I love this product and the Olive creme too.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Not to mention that the price from this supplier was 3 times more than Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>This was okay because it didn&#x27;t have petroleum in it</li>
      <li>I have used this product for over 5 years and it is outstanding.</li>
      <li>I have waves and I use this to keep my hair in top shape.</li>
      <li>Smells great and really helps moisten hair / scalp.</li>
      <li>It is great for taming my wild mop.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not the best because it tends to weigh my hair down, but it&#x27;s really great on transitioning and natural hair.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend the effort in locating a vendor.  </li>
      <li>I liked it so much that I purchase it in bulk.  </li>
      <li>The cream smells good (unless you don&#x27;t like carrots) and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>Not so good ingredients but gets the job done on natural or relaxed hair .</li>
      <li>i thought it would bring a special touch to my hair</li>
      <li>True rubbish.</li>
      <li>This works great for brittle hair, due in my case to aging.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>It works well, it did give me waves and grew hair quickly.</li>
      <li>Silky smooth, deep black, great shine!</li>
      <li>It conditions my hair really deep and makes my waves look amazing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know how healthy the ingredients are, but I don&#x27;t too much care.</li>
      <li>The coconut oil completely overpowers the smell of the carrot creme and it locks in moisture and also helps give even more shine and softness.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for only 5 days and my hair looks EXTREMELY BETTER</li>
      <li>I normally mix both creme to make an super hair conditioner and pomade substitue.</li>
      <li>I bought a small jar of that cream in Barbados, and it was really good for the hair.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair super soft.</li>
      <li>and it really softens my kinks.</li>
      <li>This carrot creme had so much hype</li>
      <li>and his hair looks so much healthier.</li>
      <li>I wish Amazon would now stock the intense moisturizing rinse out conditioner as well.  </li>
      <li>Over-all this really works.</li>
      <li>really didnt help me.</li>
      <li>This combo has taken my hair to a whole new level.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and recommend to go to [...]</li>
      <li>It definitely wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>but it didnt live up to all the hype i had heard about it.</li>
      <li>I love this product but it is not available at stores near my home.</li>
      <li>I work out at the club daily, shower,wash my hair, towel dry and apply a small amount of  this stuff and it is very effective.  </li>
      <li>From my experience though you should find an oil that your hair responds really well to like Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Coconut oil, Jojoba oil, Tea tree oil, or Castor oil and add it to the creme to help with moisture.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair so soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>now my hair is soft my scalp is no longer itchy</li>
      <li>If you have regular coarse hair I would suggest just sticking with pink hair lotion &amp; a good pomade to lay the hair down afterwards.</li>
      <li>This will give your hair that deep black you&#x27;re looking for and it makes my hair silky smooth.</li>
      <li>so of course i&#x27;m natural but I also suffer from dry scalp because I use to shampoo too much.</li>
      <li>I will look for a completely all natural product next time.</li>
      <li>In fact it kind of dried out my hair a few times.</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical in purchasing this product, but literally after the first time I saw my hair have a drastic change for the good.</li>
      <li>Not like major name brands on the retail store shelves.</li>
      <li>I have low porosity, 4c, natural hair</li>
      <li>I personally use this as more of a conditioner than a moisturizer because it does tend to dry my hair out, also some people aren&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell, not to say that it stinks</li>
      <li>if your natural and you have dry hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For those of you who have been trying to get spinning waves in your hair for years with little results, then this stuff really works.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair prefers the Olive Oil Cream</li>
    <li> I been through it all with Pink Lotion, Wavebuilder pomades, Sportin Waves, Murrays, Dax, you name it I tried it. I have been using this product for only 5 days and my hair looks EXTREMELY BETTER THAN IT DID BEFORE. The cream smells good (unless you don&#x27;t like carrots) and it makes my hair so soft. It conditions my hair really deep and makes my waves look amazing. I use this after I get out the shower with Wonder Waves from Garnier Frutus and my hair is so soft (not really a recommended combo but I have hard to wave hair). If you want to stay away from the Petrolatum jelly, THIS IS THE PRODUCT YOU WANT! I&#x27;m also getting the Olive Creme too when it comes in!!!</li>
    <li> True rubbish. I bought a small jar of that cream in Barbados, and it was really good for the hair. This time, I ordered same cream, but in the US and in a bigger jar, and it is horrible. Not to mention that the price from this supplier was 3 times more than Walgreen&#x27;s. The cream makes hair all sticky and creates a build-up and the hair does not breathe. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product if your natural and you have dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy so of course i&#x27;m natural but I also suffer from dry scalp because I use to shampoo too much. I know have a regime of co-washing and this product has help eliminate a lot of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uses along with; Hollywood Beauty Carrot Oil Root Moisturizer Hair Lotion and now my hair is soft my scalp is no longer itchy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 stars!!</li>
    <li> EXECELLENT IF YOU WANT TO SHY AWAY FROM POMADES REALLY GOOD HOLD LEAVES THE HAIR SILKY</li>
    <li> I LOVE CARROT CREME!! I have waves and I use this to keep my hair in top shape. This will give your hair that deep black you&#x27;re looking for and it makes my hair silky smooth. I personally use this as more of a conditioner than a moisturizer because it does tend to dry my hair out, also some people aren&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell, not to say that it stinks but I can see where they&#x27;re coming from. I&#x27;ve come up with a solution for both of those problems that works perfect for my hair. I add some Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to the Carrot Creme and stir it up. The coconut oil completely overpowers the smell of the carrot creme and it locks in moisture and also helps give even more shine and softness. This combo has taken my hair to a whole new level. Silky smooth, deep black, great shine! What all wavers strive for! If you&#x27;re getting this for waves or just for healthier hair you can&#x27;t go wrong. From my experience though you should find an oil that your hair responds really well to like Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Coconut oil, Jojoba oil, Tea tree oil, or Castor oil and add it to the creme to help with moisture.</li>
    <li> My husband used it once before, and will now only use this product.  It smooths out the frizzy&#x27;s and his hair looks so much healthier.</li>
    <li> Smells great and really helps moisten hair / scalp. Best when used right after a shower, no conditioner needed.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair hydrated. Not so good ingredients but gets the job done on natural or relaxed hair .</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 5 years and it is outstanding. It holds my hair in place all day and it is NOT greasy. I work out at the club daily, shower,wash my hair, towel dry and apply a small amount of  this stuff and it is very effective.  I liked it so much that I purchase it in bulk.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find in a retail store, even in the ethnic section so you may have to order it online.  I strongly recommend the effort in locating a vendor.  I tried substitutes and did not have the same result.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super soft. I don&#x27;t really know how healthy the ingredients are, but I don&#x27;t too much care. I have low porosity, 4c, natural hair and it does the job. Please try</li>
    <li> MY BF&#x27;S BARBAR TOLD HIM TO GET THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE HE HAD DRY SCALP.  HE LOVES IT, HE RELIGIOUSLY APPLIES IT EVERY NIGHT BECAUSE HE LOVES HOW IT MAKES HIS HAIR FEEL, AND THE FACT THAT IT HELPS HIS SCALP ISSUE. ITS A GREAT PRODUCT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MALES OR FEMALES.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the Olive creme too. I normally mix both creme to make an super hair conditioner and pomade substitue. it&#x27;s great for waves and to soften your hair... I gave it 5stars cause it&#x27;s a great product but 1star for the price cause you can go to walgreens store or their website get a jar and bonus washout carrot conditioner for THREE DOLLARS!!!!!!! you can get 2 jars of this product and still be paying less where they are charing you for one. I highly recommend this product and recommend to go to [...] for way cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it is not available at stores near my home. I have dreadlocks and this works the best in my hair for moisturizing touch-ups.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the truth. It leaves your hair so soft and moisturized. Love it.</li>
    <li> For those of you who have been trying to get spinning waves in your hair for years with little results, then this stuff really works. Not like major name brands on the retail store shelves. You know the ones with male models on the package with processed waves? Worry no more and wave goodbye to dull looking wannabe waves. Carrot cream provides the necessary moisture balance needed to train waves to behave and spin like you want them to. It still takes the daily brushing regimen on your part and keep a wave-cap on it when not brushing. Over-all this really works.One more styling tip. Use this for styling, do not rinse out. This is a leave-in method of spinnin...</li>
    <li> It was okay for me. but it didnt live up to all the hype i had heard about it. i dont regret buying it. not planning to buy it again. Absolutely NO COMPLAINTS about the seller I bought this from</li>
    <li> This carrot creme had so much hype so I got a bottle. It definitely wasn&#x27;t worth it. This was okay because it didn&#x27;t have petroleum in it but it didn&#x27;t work for hair. My hair was dry and itchy after about 30 minutes later. I will look for a completely all natural product next time.</li>
    <li> This product is great for transitioning hair. I have 4B type hair and it really softens my kinks. It&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side, and can be quite greasy at times. A little dime size goes a long way. When used on relaxed hair it&#x27;s not the best because it tends to weigh my hair down, but it&#x27;s really great on transitioning and natural hair. I also love the smell!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical in purchasing this product, but literally after the first time I saw my hair have a drastic change for the good. Will purchase again definetely.</li>
    <li> Bought this product about a month ago off another website after watching some youtube videos about it &amp; used in place of the luster&#x27;s pink hair lotion for a while. I have your average blk male coarse hair and this stuff really didnt help me. In fact it kind of dried out my hair a few times. If you have regular coarse hair I would suggest just sticking with pink hair lotion &amp; a good pomade to lay the hair down afterwards.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really hard to find.  I wish Amazon would now stock the intense moisturizing rinse out conditioner as well.  If they do, I&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
    <li> once again the droooooolllll smell that my boys complaint about. i thought it would bring a special touch to my hair but it didnt.</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this instead of 360 Waves Pomade. It works well, it did give me waves and grew hair quickly.</li>
    <li> This product adds moisture to the hair. It is very good for women who have 4b/4c hair like me. I would have liked it better if there were more oils in it.</li>
    <li> This works great for brittle hair, due in my case to aging.&lt;br /&gt;No unpleasing smell like some products. Use sparingly, as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> this carrot cream works great with the hair roots, they helped strengthen and deepen my 360 waves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year.  It is great for taming my wild mop.  As a woman of color, my hair is coarse and thick.  Using this product has made my daily maintenance routine easier.  It is not oily and does not stain your pillow cases.</li>
