### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>wonderful!!!!  </li>
      <li>This is the best mouth wash I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>But I got this mouthwash judging by the great reviews...and it did not disappoint!</li>
      <li>Will continue to purchase here - great product, great price.</li>
      <li>I loved it, so continue to use this product.</li>
      <li>I love this mouthwash!</li>
      <li>popular</li>
      <li>It is effective and leaves your mouth feeling so refreshed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant tasting and leaves your mouth feeling very fresh.</li>
      <li>This the most obnoxious tasting mouthwash we have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>It also has a refreshing taste.  </li>
      <li>Thia is SO much better than the alcohol laden</li>
      <li>It is now my favorite mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Taste really isn&#x27;t too great, but it does it&#x27;s purpose well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product was fine.  </li>
      <li>It keeps the mouth germ free and encourages healing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an overwhelming taste at first</li>
      <li>My hygenist complimented me on how clean my mouth was when I went for my cleaning.</li>
      <li>so I have no idea if that is true or not.  </li>
      <li>This is good stuff to use several times a day if you are on a chemo.  </li>
      <li>Leaves the mouth feeling clean and fresh for quite a while.</li>
      <li>It soothed the piercing overnight and helped it heal SO quickly.</li>
      <li>This product from H2Ocean seems to be a nice alternative to Biotene&#x27;s dry mouth mouthwash.</li>
      <li>i ran out pretty quick, but i filled the bottle back up with water and the right amount of sea salt.</li>
      <li>Was so pleased to find it here, as it has become part of my daily routine.  </li>
      <li>Initially my dentist recommended salt water rinsing for healthy teeth and gums, so I purchased this at his office.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, slightly salty taste that I prefer to more conventional mouthwashes.  </li>
      <li>Yes , I like this product very much and very convenient to order it from you</li>
      <li>but white you should be fine.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels much cleaner.  </li>
      <li>, IT DOES NOT MEAN IT&#x27;S INFECTED!</li>
      <li>It not only cleans my mouth, but aids in healing and makes my breath sweet.  </li>
      <li>(: however i would recomend getting a second bottle if you plan to use it as much as recomended for a fresh tongue pircing.</li>
      <li>oh and i would highly recomend the book &amp;#34;the pircing bible&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The taste is a bit strange at first, since it&#x27;s both salty and sweet, but the formula is very mild and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Keeps your mouth clean &amp; it costs less than what my oral surgeon charges/</li>
      <li>but I nearly couldn&#x27;t handle the taste.</li>
      <li>it turns yellow cause it gets dried out for better terms.</li>
      <li>If you can get past the taste you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
      <li>You should buy it for your mouth piercings cuz they heal faster, but if u want something that tastes decent, go with regular non alcohol mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Since this is one of the very few mouthwashes on the market that actually contain any natural enzymes (in this case, lysozyme), it&#x27;s probably worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to Biotene&#x27;s new formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> /&gt;Helpful tip: if you&#x27;re also trying to find a replacement for Biotene&#x27;s dry mouth gel, check out this option here on Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TKJD8U/</li>
<li> It is also for dry mouth!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if the mouthwash is leaking through, but every time I pick it up there is a ring of wet mouthwash on the counter.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way as a gargle or rinse.</li>
<li> Seems to have no harmful stuff like other mouthwashes do.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that there is some mystery leak with the bottle.  </li>
<li> Got a fresh oral piercing that just wouldn&#x27;t heal...talking and eating was getting painful -</li>
<li> We had been using Biotene products for years, but were forced to look for alternatives due to changes in Biotene&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
<li> However, as I cannot get it locally and the combination of the price and shipping makes it too expensive for me to continue to use.</li>

    <li> wonderful!!!!  It not only cleans my mouth, but aids in healing and makes my breath sweet.  It is also for dry mouth!</li>
    <li> worked well, i got bo infection so i would say it did its job(: however i would recomend getting a second bottle if you plan to use it as much as recomended for a fresh tongue pircing. i ran out pretty quick, but i filled the bottle back up with water and the right amount of sea salt. oh! and if you do use alot of mouthwash and stuff dont freak out if your tongue turns slightly yellow, IT DOES NOT MEAN IT&#x27;S INFECTED! as long as you dont have any discarge any color but white you should be fine. it turns yellow cause it gets dried out for better terms. oh and i would highly recomend the book &amp;#34;the pircing bible&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Tastes like lemonade made from seawater. Leaves the mouth feeling clean and fresh for quite a while. Seems to have no harmful stuff like other mouthwashes do.</li>
    <li> The product was fine.  The freight charges are rediculous!!!</li>
    <li> If you can get past the taste you&#x27;ll be fine but I nearly couldn&#x27;t handle the taste. It&#x27;s an overwhelming taste at first but I do like the refreshness after. A cooling sensation in my mouth.</li>
    <li> for all oral issue from cuts, ulcers and daily hygiene.  A little goes a long way as a gargle or rinse.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash! It&#x27;s pleasant tasting and leaves your mouth feeling very fresh. My hygenist complimented me on how clean my mouth was when I went for my cleaning.</li>
    <li> This product does the job of removing plaque.  It also has a refreshing taste.  Keeps your mouth clean &amp; it costs less than what my oral surgeon charges/</li>
    <li> This mouthwash was recommended by my dentist over a year ago. He gave me a sample to test.....I loved it, so continue to use this product. I would definitely recommend for those who like the taste of lemon.....it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to taste lemony. It doesn&#x27;t. You should buy it for your mouth piercings cuz they heal faster, but if u want something that tastes decent, go with regular non alcohol mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Yes , I like this product very much and very convenient to order it from you</li>
    <li> We had been using Biotene products for years, but were forced to look for alternatives due to changes in Biotene&#x27;s ingredients. This product from H2Ocean seems to be a nice alternative to Biotene&#x27;s dry mouth mouthwash. The taste is a bit strange at first, since it&#x27;s both salty and sweet, but the formula is very mild and a little bit goes a long way.

    <li> Thia is SO much better than the alcohol laden popular mouthwash!&lt;br /&gt;My BIG problem with this order is: I ordered four bottles and only one arrived(with no explanation!)</li>
    <li> Taste really isn&#x27;t too great, but it does it&#x27;s purpose well.&lt;br /&gt;Never had any issues with a piercing using this product.</li>
    <li> This the most obnoxious tasting mouthwash we have ever tried.  YUCK!</li>
    <li> My husbands dentist recommended this mouthwash. It is now my favorite mouthwash. I prefer this product over listerine any day. It is effective and leaves your mouth feeling so refreshed.</li>
    <li> Got a fresh oral piercing that just wouldn&#x27;t heal...talking and eating was getting painful - I was on the brink of taking it out. But I got this mouthwash judging by the great reviews...and it did not disappoint! It soothed the piercing overnight and helped it heal SO quickly. Will definitely be recommending this to everyone!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this mouthwash as something that would help my mouth keep from getting dry during sleep.  It seems to help the problem.  It has a pleasant, slightly salty taste that I prefer to more conventional mouthwashes.  However, as I cannot get it locally and the combination of the price and shipping makes it too expensive for me to continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff to use several times a day if you are on a chemo.  It keeps the mouth germ free and encourages healing. my only issue is that it is a bit too lemony for my taste… that may just be me. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is the best mouth wash I have ever used.  Initially my dentist recommended salt water rinsing for healthy teeth and gums, so I purchased this at his office.  Was so pleased to find it here, as it has become part of my daily routine.  I used to get a lot of canker sores in my mouth, which subsequently got infected, but this salt water rinse keeps the canker sores away.  Supposedly it helps stop bad breath from occurring as well, but I can&#x27;t smell my own breath so I have no idea if that is true or not.  My mouth feels much cleaner.  My only complaint is that there is some mystery leak with the bottle.  I don&#x27;t know if the mouthwash is leaking through, but every time I pick it up there is a ring of wet mouthwash on the counter.  I have investigated but cannot figure out where it is coming from.  Will continue to purchase here - great product, great price.</li>
