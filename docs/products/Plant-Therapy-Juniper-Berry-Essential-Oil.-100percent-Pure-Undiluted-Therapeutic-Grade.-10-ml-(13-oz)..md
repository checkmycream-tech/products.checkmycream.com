    <li> Smells just like juniper! I use it for disinfecting and it works great!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and smells great. Using it to make my home smell better.</li>
    <li> Terrific. I really like Plant Therapy oils because they are of excellent quality, at a great price point, and are not marketed aggressively. Plus, the company emphasizes the importance of using oils safely. The juniper is a really great, clean scent. Thanks, Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> This was a great price for this size oil, and it definitely met my expectations. It has an earthy woodsy aroma and I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I mix juniper berry with eucalyptus, peppermint, and fir for a sinus blend that I diffuse.  I get sinus headaches and that blend really helps.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil. I&#x27;d never tried juniper berry before, but I used it in an facial astringent mix with other oils. I love the aroma and my skin is smooth, clean and clear. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to EOs, and I have been reading peoples comments to get ideas on how to use this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s essential oil. What more is there to say other than this sweet scent really permeates the house when put into a diffuser and makes the room smell yummy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s a bad product. I&#x27;m just not use to the smell. It has a very unique smell. I&#x27;m a fan of a more sweeter smell. And because it had berry in it I just assumed it would be on the sweeter side. It kinda has a plant smell to it. I recommend Using it when you want more settle smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best Juniper Berry I have tried, and is very true to what this oil should smell like.  I have tried other brands, but nothing has come close to this.  I use it in my aroma therapy sessions which is a mix that I use with my clients, and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda T.</li>
    <li> As always, Plant Therapy delivers an awesome grade of oil.</li>
    <li> I love Plant Therapy oils. I have bought the more pricey oils and realized that I was not getting any better quality by paying sooo much more.I am always pleased with Plant Therapy oils.. Thanks Again!</li>
    <li> good quality oil. I mix Juniper, Cypress, Lavender and apply behind ears and scalp for ringing in my ears. It is almost immediate when it clears the feeling of congestion. I use 3 drops of each and rub it together in my hands and apply. I do not use a carrier oil, because this combination does not irritate my skin. If there was some irritation, I would mix in a little olive oil for myself.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> If you mix this with basil and sage it makes a great pick me up. Also contributes to sharper thinking.</li>
    <li> Quality Juniper berry oil. there is nothing much to say really about the essential oil.</li>
    <li> Used this in a balding serum for my brother.  He likes it and he has very sensitive skin and has had no issue.</li>
    <li> Would not be a scent to diffuse alone</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy, so far has delivered great products.  JB is no exception.</li>
    <li> I should have made sure this stuff was organic. I don&#x27;t think it is. I never used it when I realized this. I could be wrong but no label specified and they usually do if they are organic.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this at a decent price. Product arrived on time and was as expected for a fair price!</li>
    <li> Without having a medically proven method of knowing the quality, my impression is that this is a good oil. The smell is very precise and strong.</li>
    <li> Only after learning, reading and researching I realized I made a big mistake buying essential oils from this company. The product is not clean, not sure they add some chemicals to it as it is far from close to what a real, clean essential oil smells, feels and taste like.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite PT oil, scent is more herbaceous than I expected. I&#x27;ve been using in spiritual/emotional blends for its restorative properties and I&#x27;m not getting it out of it.</li>
    <li> Item was received just as described.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite oils!!! Excellent!</li>
    <li> Juniper berry has helped with sleeping, using it in my diffuser also a few drops on covers.</li>
    <li> I bought this essential oil to use as part of my anticellulite lotion recipe I found on Pinterest.  It has a pleasant smell and works great for what I bought it for.  I&#x27;m looking forward to other recipes I can use it in.</li>
    <li> Why pay more for YL oils when these  products are just as good for half as much money and twice as much product.</li>
    <li> The Juniper Berry Essential Oil that I ordered arrived quickly and I am satisfied with it in every way. It has a wonderful scent and I look forward to using it for my needs.</li>
