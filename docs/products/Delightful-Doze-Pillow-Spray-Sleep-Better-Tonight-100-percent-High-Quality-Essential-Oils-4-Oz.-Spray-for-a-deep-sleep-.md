      <li>best night of sleep in a long time.</li>
      <li>My wife and I both slept soundly and went to sleep very quickly.</li>
      <li>and her husband get as much restful sleep as they can!!!</li>
      <li>Very Fresh scent, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>We wanted something that smelled nice and soothing so that when we sprayed it as a cue for the dog, it would not only be calming to him, but also be a scent that we enjoyed.</li>
      <li>We really sleep better.</li>
      <li>We use it nightly and it totally knocks us out... in a good relaxing way.</li>
      <li>It definitely helps motivate us to be diligent with the training though, since we love smelling it :)</li>
      <li>This really works!!  </li>
      <li>Not sure if this really helps to sleep better, or more soundly, the aroma is lovely and have re-ordred a number of times already.</li>
      <li>right away!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>fragrance is very light - barely there in 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>One spray before bedtime leaves such a refreshing and restful aroma.  </li>
      <li>Very calming.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>

      <li>Very calming and soothing scent.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping it had more of a lavander smell but the other scents are stronger but even so I like it and use it almost every night on my pillow.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>It came a bit late, but someone took the time to make sure it arrived, and I appreciate that!  </li>
      <li>I normally prefer lavender &amp; valarium</li>
      <li>I received my product yesterday and began using it last night as well as tonight am very pleased, I am starting to feel the effect already would highly recommend for those who have a hard time relaxing,stress release.</li>
      <li>Very intense, heavy smell when first sprayed.</li>
      <li>I love everything except the sprayer, it sucks, it leaks</li>
      <li>I wish we&#x27;d used something different for the training because now I want to spray it everywhere (particularly on my pillow)</li>

    <li> I normally prefer lavender &amp; valarium - this has a lovely more floral scent for a nice change in pace. Delivered in great condition and timely.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and relaxing.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long. After 2 days the bottle no longer sprays.</li>
    <li> Very calming and soothing scent.  I use it to spray in the air by our pillows, when we climb into bed, and the scent relaxes us right away!!&lt;br /&gt;I even bought a second bottle for my niece who just had twins to help her and her husband get as much restful sleep as they can!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this really helps to sleep better, or more soundly, the aroma is lovely and have re-ordred a number of times already.</li>
    <li> works great. I use it on mine and my husband&#x27;s pillows and both kids pillows. My husband has a hard time staying asleep and this helps</li>
    <li> Works very well.  My wife has difficulty sleeping through the night.  With this product, she sleeps very well.  It seems to help the grandchildren sleep better as well.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very Fresh scent, not overpowering. Very calming. Works great on linens and pillows.</li>
    <li> I use it almost very night. Every morning I wake up to this luscious scent. So I need a larger bottle!</li>
    <li> This Is awful. It was to have a fragrance of lavender. It smelled nothing like lavender and I have no idea what the fragrance was but it was horrible. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I spritz it all over my house and feel like I&#x27;ve just walked into a spa. Immediate relaxation!!!</li>
    <li> fragrance is very light - barely there in 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love everything except the sprayer, it sucks, it leaks and it stops spraying. Otherwise the scent is wonderful and it helps me sleep.</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t say enough about it</li>
    <li> A little different on the scent, okay but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Well it smells great but it doesn&#x27;t work for me... in fact its got the opposite effect. It also makes me stuff. Use very little if u do buy it. It can be very overwhelming</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re actually using it as part of a separation anxiety training with our dog. We wanted something that smelled nice and soothing so that when we sprayed it as a cue for the dog, it would not only be calming to him, but also be a scent that we enjoyed. It smells amazing! I wish we&#x27;d used something different for the training because now I want to spray it everywhere (particularly on my pillow) but I know it would be confusing for our pup. It definitely helps motivate us to be diligent with the training though, since we love smelling it :)</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with this purchase.  Was very skeptical that it would work, but it did work and worked very well.  My wife and I both slept soundly and went to sleep very quickly.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful.  It came a bit late, but someone took the time to make sure it arrived, and I appreciate that!  I think even the throw pillows will be getting a mist of this!</li>
    <li> Very intense, heavy smell when first sprayed. I will not use it on childrens bedclothes. I gave it to a friend who is ill, and when she went to spray it, the nozzle popped off. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> works great. best night of sleep in a long time.</li>
    <li> Great deal all around!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this at all.  Sprayed it on my pillowcase and had to change cases immediately because to me it was stinky. Too much trouble to return it so I&#x27;m out my purchase price. Will never order this again.</li>
    <li> We use it nightly and it totally knocks us out... in a good relaxing way.</li>
    <li> Would prefer that there is more lavender, but otherwise like the spray.</li>
    <li> A little citrusy but I love to smell this at night when trying to relax.  I think it helps you go into a deep sleep.</li>
    <li> Really a nice scent. Helps me to get to sleep at night</li>
    <li> I was hoping it had more of a lavander smell but the other scents are stronger but even so I like it and use it almost every night on my pillow.  The pump/sprayer only works about every 3rd spray.</li>
    <li> I received my product yesterday and began using it last night as well as tonight am very pleased, I am starting to feel the effect already would highly recommend for those who have a hard time relaxing,stress release. Having used a similar product in the past I know that it takes a while for your system feel the relief especially if you&#x27;re on a lot of medications.</li>
    <li> One spray before bedtime leaves such a refreshing and restful aroma.  We really like it.</li>
    <li> I love to pamper myself and boy, I feel like all is well in the world when I spray my pillow before I sleep. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not a favorite.  Would not buy it again.</li>
