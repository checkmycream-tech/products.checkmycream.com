      <li>The best facial cleanser for &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin ( i&#x27;m 59)  not too drying.</li>
      <li>I saw a difference with one use and it got better with continuous use.  </li>

      <li>Best facewash ive had in a long time!</li>
      <li>Great coverage and no problems with my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that it is fragrance free which is great if you are sensitive to strong smells.</li>
      <li>think I probably will be purchasing a full bottle after my sample one is out. :)</li>
      <li>Nice gentle cleanser.  </li>
      <li>And my skin is so smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>Gentle and effective.  </li>
      <li>but it is totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Face feels clean.</li>
      <li>have tried many cleansers over the years, and this is my absolute FAVORITE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>Really gives my skin a lovely finish.</li>
      <li>, I love it skin feels clean and soft</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>It lathers up into a smooth velvety foam that rinses completely clean yet leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Face feels very clean but not dried out when done.</li>
      <li>I have bought other cosmetics in this line; all are superior.</li>
      <li>I guess it cleans the face all right, but so does soap.  </li>
      <li>First of all, this cleanser is formulated without:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no pesky fragrance, and it actually contains Manuka Honey, one of my favorite ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is a smooth cream and it settles well into your pours to cleanse you face properly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and my skin is so much smoother.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product and will continue using it.</li>
      <li>I love the whole product line, it works quickly, effectively and a little goes a long way!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second of all, it was gentle, non-drying and left my face very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Have to use very little to work up a nice foam.  </li>
      <li>My face feels very smooth and clean after using it and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>would also highly recommend the mud mask.</li>
      <li>I was looking to try something new.</li>
      <li>That was great news for me because I generally only use clean products and its always important to avoid all the nasty stuff that can end up in our skincare stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>does burn my eyes if it gets near.</li>
      <li>A little pricey for everyday use, but love the way my skin looks!</li>

    <li> I used to buy this at ulta but they stopped carrying it. This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s moisturizing without clogging pores. It&#x27;s a must have for 40 something skin. I&#x27;m so happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!  It lathers up into a smooth velvety foam that rinses completely clean yet leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I also love the fact that it is fragrance free which is great if you are sensitive to strong smells.</li>

    <li> This is an expensive cream that is stiff and difficult to spread, and doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize at all.  I guess it cleans the face all right, but so does soap.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Nice gentle cleanser.  Love the Sarah McNamara products.  Good quality, nice consistency and foaming with very good fragrance. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The product came in a timely manner, but the tube expiration date was April, 2015 !  After using this product, I found it no better than similar ones I have used</li>
    <li> It is a smooth cream and it settles well into your pours to cleanse you face properly.</li>
    <li> First of all, this cleanser is formulated without:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Parabens&lt;br /&gt;- Sulfates&lt;br /&gt;- Synthetic Fragrances&lt;br /&gt;- Synthetic Dyes&lt;br /&gt;- Petrochemicals&lt;br /&gt;- Phthalates&lt;br /&gt;- GMOs&lt;br /&gt;- Triclosan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay! That was great news for me because I generally only use clean products and its always important to avoid all the nasty stuff that can end up in our skincare stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, it was gentle, non-drying and left my face very soft and smooth.

    <li> Have to use very little to work up a nice foam.  Face feels very clean but not dried out when done.</li>
    <li> does a great job. only takes a drop to get alot of foam.... does burn my eyes if it gets near. Will reorder if I ever run out!</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used.  It is expensive, so I may not continue to buy it, but cost is the only issue.  Great product.  I have bought other cosmetics in this line; all are superior.</li>
    <li> Love all the products</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Miracle Skins Hydroactive Cleanser!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many cleansers over the years, and this is my absolute FAVORITE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the texture, love the scent, love the results, and love the RESULTS!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and my skin is so much smoother.  I saw a difference with one use and it got better with continuous use.  Also, a little goes a long way.  I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Gentle and effective.  I have rosacea and this does not irritate at all.  Removes makeup and cleanses without drying my skin.  Pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I initially found this cream as a set on Gilt, and then of course couldn&#x27;t find it any where else but here. I really like this product and will continue using it. I use it in the morning with my clarisonic cleanser and have noticed my skin looks healthy and glowing. have had no issues with breakouts and I recommend it to those looking for a good, mild cleanser.</li>
    <li> Really gives my skin a lovely finish. It evens out my skin tone and I can&#x27;t see it&lt;br /&gt;in my pores.</li>
    <li> Bought this cleaners at Ulta and it is THE BEST FACE WASH EVER! I used the clinque acne face wash line for 5 years. I was looking to try something new. I do not have acne, I just have those once in awhile break outs (cyst acne). And since I have used this face (3 months now) not one break out. And my skin is so smooth and hydrated. The only down side is that they are always sold out of it in the stores so you are better off ordering it online.&lt;br /&gt;I would also highly recommend the mud mask. Its a little pricey..but it is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this facewash and will continue to order it online! My face feels very smooth and clean after using it and a little goes a long way. Best facewash ive had in a long time!</li>
    <li> A little pricey for everyday use, but love the way my skin looks! Great coverage and no problems with my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the usual make up residue I get from other facial cleansers afterwards.  Good product.  Face feels clean.</li>
    <li> The best facial cleanser for &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin ( i&#x27;m 59)  not too drying. A pea sized dab is all one needs, thus the bottle lasts for about a year!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL....I love the whole product line, it works quickly, effectively and a little goes a long way!!!! I will buy this product again for sure.</li>
    <li> Okay this was tried in the store and very expensive so I came on here and found the same product here on line, I love it skin feels clean and soft</li>
