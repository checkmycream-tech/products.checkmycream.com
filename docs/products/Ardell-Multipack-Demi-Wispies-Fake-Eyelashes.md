<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best natural looking lashes ever!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but the lashes aren&#x27;t identical they&#x27;re close but I can tell the difference. I still wear them though and try to make them look the same.</li>
    <li> Very realistic looking and easy to apply lashes. I believe each lash is expected to last a week but I take care of mine. Holding the lashes down I will gently peel away and remove the glue used during the day and reuse the lashes the next day. I bought the Ardell lash applicator and Ardell dark glue and I&#x27;m all set! Cannot see the glue as it looks like eyeliner throughout the lash line. Brilliant! I bought the brand due to the high ratings and I am truly not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great lashes...serves the purpose</li>
    <li> Love love love these lashes!! Always my go to :)</li>
    <li> These are good! I&#x27;m glad I went w the Demi Whispies -these are the ones my salon sells- and the ones thar most natural looking. They are long- but not &#x27;overly&#x27;- cheaper here&lt;br /&gt;I went for fake because I can&#x27;t wear the eye lash enhancers- tried them all- even Latiece- my eyes are too sensitive- and I hear extensions wreak your own. My eye lashes are slowly falling out due to a condition I have- a form a of dermintitis- skin condition- I&#x27;m 57. I use a  strong cream for the bad itching. I hope it helps.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways- I&#x27;ve done extensive research on fake eyelashes and putting them on- the best way I have found-&lt;br /&gt;- use eye liner first- use brush on adhesive like Revlon- let sit for 30-40 seconds- use lrg tweezers or fingers to place on lash line - line up and press down especially on ends. - use mascara. Contentrating on lash line and up - when take off-dip a Q tip dipped in OliFree  Neutrogena  eye make up remover -they will pull off- put lashes on Kleenex and run that q tip over the fakes to remove excess glue and mascara. Then I use Almay oil free eye make up pads to complete  whiping- any excess -and then that pad or another cotton ball to remover eye make up on my eyes.  then put lashes back in container they came in - they will last almost 2 weeks- I know it seems like a lot of care- but I don&#x27;t mind- it come fast- it&#x27;s just part of my nite time routine - worth it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic fake eyelashes. My girlfriend really enjoyed it. Great price too. Came in very quick as well.</li>
    <li> Great price and fits amazing. I only get wispys</li>
    <li> Love it! Came in earlier than I expected.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected.  Great condition exactly as expected</li>
    <li> I love them!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used them all the time. They are super easy to put and easier to remove. Easy to clean and re use.&lt;br /&gt;They are the perfect size so you dont too dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have the typical short, straight lashes that many asians have so I have gone through many types of false lashes. I don&#x27;t like the other false lashes that are too regular in the lash pattern because it looks so very fake. These lashes are almost too long for me but are still pretty &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking because of the wispy variations in lash length. Overall, great every day lashes and good value in this purchase.</li>
    <li> my favorite lashes and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> Very good. Love them. I&#x27;m make up artist and this is one of my fav style of eyelashes. It looks very natural and very easy to apply,</li>
    <li> Great pair of lashes ! definetely going to repurchase , they&#x27;re great and durable and good for reusing them .</li>
    <li> These have lasted so long!!!! Best eyelashes ever!!!</li>
    <li> Love the natural feel</li>
    <li> I bought these and some from drug store just as a practice, putting them on/off, maybe it&#x27;s me but i still can&#x27;t put them on :(  they appeared to look nice even they are not placed correctly.</li>
    <li> Natural lashes but do not last long. Can reuse 2 or 3 times</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m experimenting with lashes...trying to find out which ones I like more/better than others. I have small eyes since I&#x27;m half Asian and these lashes didn&#x27;t fit all the way across my eyes, which was something different for me. They still worked and looked pretty good. I guess I just thought since my eyes were smaller than most people&#x27;s that they would stretch across my whole eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None the less, I&#x27;ll be wearing them again and I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love them. Very natural.</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes! Lengthy, but still natural looking. Usually buy them from a beauty store, but a few bucks cheaper on here. Worth it with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I love these they look natural.</li>
    <li> These are the prettiest lashes.. Love the shape and they are so easy to use!</li>
    <li> Perfect for continuous wear and ultra natural. Love these lashes by Ardell. ...I would totally recommended these to someone else.  They arrived super faster than estimated as well.</li>
    <li> As a person who suffers from Tichommia, the disease of a person plucking of their hair for trigger reasons, this lashes is the closest thing that helps me cover my bald eyelids. No one ever notice that I have no hair nor wearing any fake lashes. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> They look great on. My daughter wore them for prom.</li>
    <li> Uneven and funky. I know they are supposed to be natural but they just seemed all wrong compared to some I purchased at Ulta.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re wanting the natural but long look with falsies...these are the way to go.  i hated the straight blunt cut lashes that you find most places....it just shouts &amp;#34;yeah these are fake&amp;#34;.  these are beautiful and look much more natural then any other style ive worn. will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> These are nice. They&#x27;re not over the top</li>
    <li> These are great looking natural lashes. When I ordered them I wasn&#x27;t sure how natural they would look but I&#x27;m glad I purchased them. Not too long and not too thin. I went on YouTube to look at how they looked in real life. They are super easy to apply. I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
    <li> Loved these Ardell Wispies !!! Me and my best friend wore these for prom and got so many compliments. Best lashes I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> Love love love these lashes! Looks sooo natural..will be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> My favorite drugstore lashes but in a bundle! They look slightly different from the store bought ones but at this price I can&#x27;t really complain. They look fabulous and natural even on my asian eyes.</li>
    <li> Just like the package! Love!</li>
    <li> Fresh and naturally looking, and I often have people confuses them as my real lashes. :)</li>
    <li> Terrible.  They fall apart when you remove them from the plastic.  They fall apart when you hold them.  They fall apart while they are on your eyes.</li>
    <li> Great Product! GREAT PRICE!&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again if needed!</li>
    <li> I love my wispies fake eyelashes....they certainly don&#x27;t look fake!</li>
    <li> Wife loves these lashes. Came in non damaged.</li>
    <li> I ordered 6 pack and one box arrived damaged. The other 5 were perfect, I didn&#x27;t try getting a new pack or refund on the damamged pack. So to be fair - accidents happen. I just don&#x27;t like wasting my money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really even need glue when you first take them out of the package and put them on. However, if you&#x27;re going to reuse them you need to purchase glue. Took this photo in the midst of doing my makeup, but once I had finished my makeup these eye lashes looked real. I found that adding mascara to my real lashes helps the false ones blend in.</li>
    <li> You have to trim them to make them fit your eye, and I have to use an applicator and use extra glue, but I love these</li>
    <li> these are very pretty everyday lashes. give you a flirty look!</li>
    <li> my favorite lashes. love they come in combo packs now</li>
    <li> They are a bit too much for every day use but great for special occasions.</li>
    <li> the best fake lashes for a natural wispy look and great price. Dont forget to buy your own glue though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving these lashes, light weight and comfortable to wear. For the price and amount of lashes, its worth the buy</li>
    <li> Love these lashes on brides, bridal parties, special events. They have a clear band and have a great balance of a natural and dramatic lash. Arrived 12 hours after ordering!</li>
    <li> Amazing lashes a lil dramatic for everyday but then again I&#x27;m a diva so it works</li>
    <li> When my eyelashes started falling out I started using these.  I really like the shape of them and how easy they are to put on and take off.</li>
    <li> I love love love these eyelashes! They look so natural, yet long at the same time. All my clients love how they look in these!! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> these look great on! They don&#x27;t look over top, they look really natural! I got a lot of compliments the first day I wore them. Unfortunately no glue so you do have to buy it seperately but that&#x27;s no problem. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> For me this is a basic part of make up. Having fake lashes on completes everything! I especially love this lashes because it looks so natural, soft and reusable. :)</li>
    <li> Loved them! They look super natural</li>
    <li> Too short in width for my eyes and rip very easily.</li>
    <li> IM IN LOVE WITH THESE LASHES THEY ARE THE BEST TO WARE EVERYDAY, TO WORK ,TO SCHOOL, AND  SHOPPING ! IM IN LOVE  &amp;#60;33333 THE BEST. I RECOMMEND THESE LASHES TO EVERONE. THEY LOOK SOOOOOO NARURAL ! :)</li>
    <li> Perfect eyelashes so glamorous but natural looking</li>
    <li> These are by far my favorite lashes!!! They compete any makeup look and make my eyes pop!!</li>
    <li> i am not a professional with eyelashes so this pack allowed me to practice and still manage to wear them multiple times before they became worn out.</li>
    <li> They look beautiful, feel weightless and get me many compliments. These are the perfect falsies if you want to glam up a &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34;! Favorite lashes!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite lashes for everyday use. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> These are the best, most natural looking lashes I&#x27;ve ever tried!  They even look great with no liner.  To fit my eyes, I trim off the two longest lash wisps from the end, and then wear them on the reversed eyes (fuller part towards the center) to create a really natural, wide-eyed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> very natural look. love these. will order more when I need some.</li>
    <li> Natural texture is very beautiful ..thanx</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! They are super sexy but also natural enough for daytime wear. They are easy enough for beginners to apply but also a go to for more seasoned wearers like me. If you are looking for classy lashes, give these a try. You definitely won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Long, Natural Appeal.&lt;br /&gt;Smack these suckers on ladies or gentlemen and watch the heads turn.&lt;br /&gt;The nearly clear lash line makes it blend with your real lashes for optimal realness effect!&lt;br /&gt;Also!&lt;br /&gt;Out of each pair I was able to wear them 2-3 times depending if I remembered to clean them well after taking off, I would suggest only two wears a pair though!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not experienced with lashes, I&#x27;m not sure these are for you just for the mere fact they&#x27;re very dainty.</li>
    <li> Super happy. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Im obsessed with these lashes and once again the seller did not disappoint. I will continue to be a faithful customer recommend them to all my friends. These lashes are extremely natural looking and I am constantly getting compliments.</li>
    <li> Tedious to put on, but once on the effect makes my eyes look pretty.  It&#x27;s noticeable by others without it looking outrageously fake.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Reallycute. I will use them for volume since they&#x27;re too short for lenght, which was why I bought them. Kinda disappointed but overall okay purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these. they arrived very fast and they are extremely light weight for everyday wear. they can be used more than once and the look great with morning or night looks.</li>
    <li> natural looking lashes, they are always sold out at my local store.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with a pair of demi wispies!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite lashes! though, sometimes the pack comes with a few non symmetrical lash sets. Not that big of a deal for me. Love the look of them.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. They are so pretty and they look so natural. They arrived on time. The lash band is so thin which makes them very easy to apply. These are everyday lashes; not dramatic but noticeable. Very wispy. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Very nice,comfortable.  Very easy to put on..Nice looking!!!!</li>
    <li> My fave go-to lashes!</li>
    <li> Beautiful lashes, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will order more</li>
    <li> Very natural and easy to apply.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> love these lashes, but they are considered as an &amp;#34;Add On Item&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I am loving these lashes! definitely will be purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> Really fun, flirty, and wispy looking lashes.  These lashes are feminine and dramatic; they add some volume and length, but nothing overboard. If you&#x27;re looking for lashes that will give your eyes a more \\&quot;open\\&quot; and flirty appearance, you will love these lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that these Demi Wispies have a clear band. This means the strip lash is much more flexible and can accommodate any eye shape with more ease. The band also makes the lashes more versatile as they can even be worn without any eyeliner. The band also makes these lashes feel very lightweight and comfortable compared to their strip-lash counterparts on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price of a single pair of these lashes, I will continue to repurchase the multipacks.</li>
    <li> MY ALL TIME BEST LASHED! those lashes looks incredibly natural and gorgeous this is the 3rd pack i get and willing to get more</li>
    <li> In my never ending search for eyelashes that look good, these are right up there.  They may be a little too long for my eyes, but I would buy them again.  Now I just have to master getting them on without gluing my eye shut or gluing them to high on my eyelid!  I don&#x27;t know that they look great after wearing them and then trying to wash and wear them again.</li>
    <li> Very Natural eyelashes, blends well with real lashes. Perfect length for all kinds of makeup, you can go natural with it, but also sexy wild. Depends on how you apply your eyeshadow. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to wear and I got two wears out of each pair.</li>
    <li> very natural looking.  Easy to apply.  Can trim for perfect fit.  Fast shipping.  Recommend this seller.  AAA</li>
    <li> These are my favorite eyelashes ever.  I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes nearly everyday for years and these are hands down the best in my opinion.  They look so natural but they still add depth, femininity, and a polished look to your makeup.  The wispy aspect of these lashes look more randomized and less perfect which REALLY makes them look more natural and pop.</li>
    <li> Great quality products for a good price!</li>
    <li> Great price for two packs especially with the amount for shipping</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re so natural looking! I always order !!!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite falsies. They&#x27;re very natural-looking, I always get compliments when I have them on.</li>
    <li> These lashes look great. they look so natural</li>
    <li> I just ordered these for subscription I love these that much!</li>
    <li> These lashes are my first falsies and i am very pleased. They look natural. I have made a mistake putting a water resistant eye liner on the top when I was wearing them, couldn&#x27;t clean it off and had to toss a pair. So don&#x27;t be me.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as shown. You have to have your own eyelash glue though :) but no biggie!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! I get like 10 uses a pair!!</li>
    <li> Awesome lashes I use duo glue lashes are easy to clean and re use don&#x27;t look to fake and are very light and flexible highly recommend</li>
    <li> love these demi wispies they are really natural looking and last a long time</li>
    <li> High quality lashes for the price.  They&#x27;re the perfect combination of dramatic but still pretty natural looking.  My only tiny complaint is they are just slightly too small for my eyes.  But I have pretty big eyes so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for most.  I used these on a friend for whom I did bridal makeup and her maid of honor and they loved them.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes.  The style of these lashes look more natural.  I&#x27;d recommend these to those who do not want the super fake lash look.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Great eyelashes! Love it!</li>
    <li> These lashes are so nice! I absolutely love these lashes, I had to write a review right away. I got these for my wedding day and I am SO excited to wear them! I just tested them out tonight and HAD to write this review because they are PERFECT. I applied them with Duo Lash Adhesive Clear and they look amazing.</li>
    <li> these eyelashes are so natural looking I love them</li>
    <li> I love these lashes.  Price is great and so is the quality.  I would definitely recommend these to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I bought one of those bulk packs of eyelashes and thought those were awesome. But this one is even better. It&#x27;s not as cheap, but the quality is way better. It doesn&#x27;t poke you in the eye cause the ends are soft and are really comfortable on. I can wear this for a whole day!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these, they dont look to dramatized but they do make the eyes look amazing</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite natural lashes. They do look natural and I love how the band is so thin. Easy to put on. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Simply put, Ardell makes some of the best lashes and I do not hesitate to buy them nor should you. Recommend highly. I love the wispies.</li>
    <li> These are my absolute favorite lashes! They are perfect for an everyday look, that look enough to have thick full lashes, but also don&#x27;t look too overdone. If you apply these lashes well, they honestly can look very natural. I like that the lashes are short in the front, and then flutter out to long on the end, because it gives that really flirty look. These lashes are also amazing quality! As long as you take care of them and clean them gently, you can get several uses out of just one pair.</li>
    <li> One of the best lashes I&#x27;ve used. They are the perfect length for my eyes which is great because that means no trimming/measuring required. Apply mascara to natural lashes as normal and pop these atop of it all and voila! You&#x27;ve got  yourself natural, full, and volumized lashes. Easy application as well.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fast enough delivery love product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Best natural looking lashes! Can definitely wear these whenever.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great purchase</li>
    <li> Flimsy and too difficult to get on. Probably on large eyes these would work well.</li>
    <li> i wear these daily. it is such a steal for this price. i am definitely getting more of these again.</li>
    <li> These are the best natural looking false eyelashes I have ever tried! When applied correctly, these will last all day. They&#x27;re so pretty and fun to wear! They&#x27;re a lot more comfortable than other lashes I&#x27;ve tried too--even ones that are very similar in weight length and size</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok.  I find the lining to be a bit too thick, that when I try to use them, i have trouble getting the very edge to stick all the way to my skin.</li>
    <li> Best false lashes ever.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these lashes! So natural and add just a little extra oomp!&lt;br /&gt;So obsessed - will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I love these! Makes me look so goddess like! Caught them on sales with free shipping &amp; the shipping was quick. I was recommend these to anyone :)</li>
    <li> So pretty I feel like Kim K</li>
    <li> Love the lashes. Need to order more.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these lashed. They are the perfect length and fullness. No one ever believes that they are fake.</li>
    <li> Literally the best eyelashes ever!! Looks so natural! I&#x27;m sticking to these :)</li>
    <li> Very cute lashes. I need to trim them to make them look more natural. They do not seem to last through too make uses, especially if you curl them.</li>
    <li> i used one pair of these lashes 3 times and it still looks good as new! it looks so natural ; you can stack 2 pairs for a dramatic look.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely amaaazzziinnnggg ...they&#x27;re super natural, looks like your own lashes and reusable....think I&#x27;m going to order another pack just to have on hand...</li>
    <li> I love them!  The are the perfect size.</li>
    <li> A lot longer than I thought but their nice</li>
    <li> LOVE these lashes. I wear them several days in a row. The are the closest to natural I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
    <li> Realistic expectations: if you expect lightweight, natural looking lashes, the demi wispies are it! I strongly suggest the brown version for us ladies with lighter complexions. They would look more natural and allow you to build your black mascara to the desired intensity as you would your own natural lashes. Think, &amp;#34;still me, but ENHANCED!&amp;#34; Unless you&#x27;re going for a more dramatic night look, I think brown is the way to go instead of black. As you can tell from my pictures, I did not apply these lashes with glue, and instead, just layed them on to see the appearance. Personally, in my case, I believe I will trim the outer ends before I wear them. But overall, they look great. And my eyes are deep-set and smaller than those of some lucky people. So fear not, buy them, and just remember to trim them so you don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;wingy&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;droopy&amp;#34;. Hope this helped someone!</li>
    <li> Effective, but did not last the crying storm of my wedding from all the happy tears.</li>
    <li> These lashes are beautiful and so natural looking. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> They look so beautiful and natural on my eyes. Only thing is I have big eyes so they don&#x27;t fit my whole eyes, but beautiful nonetheless...</li>
    <li> Much longer than expected. I saw &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and thought they were, however the &amp;#34;Demi&amp;#34; pack is much longer than the regular natural pack.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes. They add a special something to your look. No one can tell I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes, just that my lashes look good.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not as natural looking as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and natural appearance and easy to use</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes.....they are the BEST......wouldn&#x27;t use any others and this company is.....fast the product is very good...totally reliable......</li>
    <li> these are beautiful and very natural looking :))</li>
    <li> They were brand new and real Ardell.So easy to put on and looks natural.I ordered the Sept.17th and received my lashes the two days later with standard shipping.I am very pleased</li>
    <li> If your looking for natural lashes then these are the best, Good deal for the quantity and look. I use weave bonding glue and they stay on for weeks.</li>
    <li> looks soooooo good on me</li>
    <li> Amaaazing lashes. By far the easiest and best  lashes I&#x27;ve ever tried. These are more for natural looks and I definitely recommend this for beginners.</li>
    <li> love these lashes! they&#x27;re so natural but a little bit dramatic at the same time</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look natural on Asian eyes....unless you wear a lot of makeup.  Kinda look like a drag queen type of fake lashes in natural day light.  Might be good for a night out clubbing with heavy makeup...but not really a natural look for Asians.</li>
    <li> The most real looking lashes on the market. No clumpy lines at the base, and natural looking with the amount of extra lashes. Great price.</li>
    <li> INCREDIBLY comfortable compared to most fake eyelashes. They also make your lashes look full and long, but not overly fake (though ofc you can tell they&#x27;re fake lashes, i mean that&#x27;s the point of wearing fake lashes) :p But this is a really good buy for those going for the naturalistic look.</li>
    <li> Perfect for first time false eyelash wearers. If you&#x27;re looking for a subtle but glamorous look, these are the lashes for you. Just as the name suggests, they are wispie and natural looking. The lashes are not packed too closely together, so you won&#x27;t get that overdone, drag makeup effect. They can basically pass for your own natural lashes.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! And durable! Great price compared to Walgreens or beauty supplies!</li>
    <li> There is definitely a right and left eyelash. I didn&#x27;t know that at first and you can tell that one side of the eyelash is longer. Easy mistake to fix though. Just peeled off and reapplied the glue (you have to purchase separately). Don&#x27;t wear these at night. I slept in mine and flattened one eyelash in a crazy shape. I recommend taking these off at night and reapply in the morning. Just use tweezers to take off the old glue. Use mascara and eyeliner to blend these lashes in with your real lashes.</li>
    <li> I was expecting these to come September 8- September 10 and I was surprised, but excited, when they came on the 6th! They look even more amazing in person I can&#x27;t stop looking at them and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them!</li>
    <li> They are pretty. They are not as full as I like so I stuck two sides together which made them perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing fakies for a million years, and these are my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lashes for everyday wear. Sometime I like to do a larger style but the Demi wispies are perfect for a more subtle fake eyelash, or just for beginners.</li>
    <li> they are not long enough</li>
    <li> Most natural lashes! A little short in length but still love!</li>
    <li> Loved the eyelashes everyone doesn&#x27;t expect that there fake eyelashes came with 2 packages loved it more cheaper then the store way better loved them will buy again 😌👌</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t wear this everyday but for special occasions these are definitely my go to eyelashes! Worn then to a new years party and received multiple complements! For this price you cannot beat it! This is the best price i can find for these eyelashes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes on my clients. They go on so easy and look so natural. Will be ordering more today. Thank you</li>
    <li> my favorite lashes and it looks super natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t pull off thick lashes or dramatic lashes so this makes my eyes pop in the most natural way</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the long ones that I was expecting. I guess these are the small wispies...</li>
    <li> Nice quality and came quickly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love love love these! They&#x27;re better than the expensive ones. They also look so natural, really good for brides since they are extremely flattering and add fullness to your natural lashes without being overwhelming. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> My fave lashes!  I do a reorder of these lashes at least twice a month and I buy them in bulk. As a pro make up artist I definitely  recommend them.</li>
    <li> Devoted purchaser of Demi Wispies. Love the 4 pack.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. Surprisingly, they look natural. I have almond monolids, so it enhances my eyes very seductively.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes ...best natural looking lashes</li>
    <li> Love ardell. Not a great idea though,..it&#x27;s hard not to mess up other lashes when trying to remove a pair. Better off buying individual ones</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. Love the multipack!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite lashes in a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I love my new eyelashes by Ardell. The eyelashes are nice and soft and they don&#x27;t feel heavy on your eyes. I&#x27;m giving this Seller a Five Star Rating. Deliver on time, securely packed and well priced. I&#x27;m a happy customer😊</li>
    <li> Best eyelashes ever 👌🙌</li>
    <li> I love them, they are not too heavy or false looking. Gives a great natural look</li>
    <li> I actually ordered these thinking it came with glue.. It DOES NOT! :( However I just bought the actual kit (lashes including glue and applier) and had a billion lashes! Lol. Love these! My first pair of lashes, and they were so easy to apply I couldn&#x27;t believe it! The glue provides a great hold and taking them off is also very easy and doesn&#x27;t tug at your eye. I will be buying again soon!</li>
    <li> Best natural lashes out there for a very affordable price :) They are great for an everyday look. They&#x27;ll last you a couple of months if you take care of them properly!</li>
    <li> I always hear people rave about these, but when I tried them out, the lashes were garishly long and looked so tacky!</li>
    <li> These are sooo pretty but I already have natural eyelashes so these don&#x27;t really complement me</li>
    <li> My favorite lashes.  My lashes are already pretty long, curly, and thick but these add an extra oomph.  I get compliments on them often and they are really pretty.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews...but I will honestly say I am so picky about everything all the way down to my lashes. These ardell demi whispies look so natural. I naturally have long eye lashes I use these for fullness and additional length. They look so natural if installed right. I usually put them extremely close to my lash line. they blend perfectly! love them I just ordered more!! my friends used mine up!! lol</li>
    <li> I love my eyelashes. Thank you so much! I will buy this again (:</li>
    <li> Delivery quickly.  It was what I expected.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE! VERY LIGHT &amp; EASY TO APPLY! i LOVE THEM! VERY COST EFFECTIVE ALSO! GET YOURS NOW!!! :))</li>
    <li> My oh my!! I love the lashes, if u want a natural look, order these, I will definitely order more... The arrived on time.. Was was a plus...</li>
    <li> Very beautiful lashes. Can be used a couple of times if clean well.</li>
    <li> These are good but I think cherry lashes are softer.</li>
    <li> These are the same length as natural REAL eyelashes its pointless to wear them.I&#x27;ll stick with my ardell wispie glamour lashes thank you. Their noticeable but not so much to where they look fake</li>
    <li> I did have to trim them but i like the way they look on eyes. I feel like give a more natural look compared to other false eyelashes. I actually order the product twice, and the first time i ruined every eyelash trying to put them along my natural eyelashes (it was my first time trying) second time around, im getting better, and i have to say i love these and i love they come in a triple set</li>
    <li> Very natural and faltering, and good value</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried them yet but they look so pretty and natural in the package. Can&#x27;t wait to put them on.</li>
    <li> Ardell, hands down, makes my favorite false eyelashes. The quality is great- they can be reused multiple times and look stunning on. These pairs in particular are long and wispy- perfect for a flirty look. The deal on here is wonderful. Will definitely be repurchasing if necessary.</li>
    <li> These are the best falsies out there...and I&#x27;ve tried many.  They look great and natural and give your lashes just the right amount of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; for your eyes.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes , they are the best.</li>
    <li> I love love this false eyelashes for everyday look. Not too long yet still give you that sophisticated look.  Sure i will repurchase this bad boy!</li>
    <li> Great product! eyelashes looked natural and were easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I love how I get twice as many eye lashes for less then what I pay at Sallys!</li>
    <li> Natural and light. I&#x27;m not a lash wearer about this one looks natural enough to wear everyday if I ever decide to</li>
    <li> Very good length, long but not too long. They look natural. If you are gentle with them they can be reused many times.</li>
    <li> Really fast delivery! And excelelnt quality :)</li>
    <li> my favorite lashes... they look natural and are very easy to apply... with proper care they can last you 8-10 wears each... Beautifull lashes</li>
    <li> I got these for my mom but she didn&#x27;t like them because they were too natural for her taste lol but I like these lashes so yeah!</li>
    <li> Product is right and at a great price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s waaaaaaaaaaaw first of all I don&#x27;t like eyelashes because I didn&#x27;t use the right one , but with this I can&#x27;t say how happy I am .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot .&lt;br /&gt;Reorder it again soon</li>
    <li> I love this lashes!  Demi wispies are my favorite. It arrive super fast. I had to order them because I couldn&#x27;t find any at Walmart or Target.</li>
    <li> Really good eyelashes,, love them</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore these lashes. Paired with the Duo lash glue, they last me all day. I was so sad when it was time to get to bed, I was way too enamored with how they look.</li>
    <li> Overpriced, but good quality product.</li>
    <li> Just like the one you purchase at your local pharmacy. Love these!</li>
    <li> Those lashes are amazing, their shape makes it so hard for others to know that they&#x27;re fake :) they&#x27;re so light on the eyes and very good-looking. And the only con is that they&#x27;re not that strong, I mean that they are so light that they stick together and get bent so easily!! Forever a favourite ;)</li>
    <li> awesome im beyond im love super happy super excited super comfortable</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried them yet but they look beautiful and shipped faster than expected :) if they look as good on as in the packaging and for the price it&#x27;ll be worth 5 stars</li>
    <li> Very good lashes. Always order when I run out</li>
    <li> I love to wear these eyelashes they truly are the epitome of beauty.  They look very natural to the eyes.</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes they look very natural :)</li>
    <li> Very natural looking and it doesn&#x27;t weigh now your lids</li>
    <li> These lashes fell apart way too easily. I bought the same lash style from another Amazon seller for about $5 and those were better quality. These seem like knockoffs.</li>
    <li> I ordered these lashes thinking they would be longer and thicker, I was wrong! I typically like to wear lashes that are thicker and a little more dramatic than these were. If you&#x27;re looking for a more natural look, then maybe you will like them. They do run short!</li>
    <li> High quality lashes. I  can reuse them several times without distorting the lashes. I like to keep them in the storage to maintain shape. Good deal</li>
    <li> Love the lashes order them every two weeks</li>
    <li> Lovely, natural looking lashes.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail so fast!! Very good natural quality lashes!!! Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> they are super soft and comfortable, they look very natural. good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes.  They last more than one out two uses,  and I use alot of mascara and eyeliner.  They look natural and add juat enough length, but not enough to appear fake</li>
    <li> these are great lashes.  I&#x27;m a makeup artist and purchased these to use for weddings.  they are so natural looking!</li>
    <li> Item received exactly as pictured.  Love the product and convenience of buying a multipack!</li>
    <li> easy to put on and off, I love it!  Looks amazing, natural, but with a flare :)</li>
    <li> These are THE BEST eyelashes I have ever used! I have almost no lashes left due to getting extensions put in (DON&#x27;T DO IT LADIES!) and people have no clue that these are not my natural lashes. I highly recommend them! I use DUO waterproof glue in black to secure them and I never have a problem with lifting.</li>
    <li> These lashes were longer than expected. I like them for evenings out, but they are a little much for me for everyday wear to work.</li>
    <li> Shipping was really fast. Lashes are beautiful and authentic. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Looks great and natural! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> They were a little too much for my taste and also too long for a natural but if I&#x27;m going out to a party then definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Are short enough to be cute and long enough to to be classy.  The lash line is clear so you may want a touch of eyeliner.  I am a true amateur so I bought these to practice with.  I&#x27;m still not doing a great job, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> These lashes look very natural when applied right and the lashes are separated perfectly! The thing that I don&#x27;t like is that they&#x27;re demi; it just makes them look less natural in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Beautiful,,so light and natural..i love it 💕</li>
    <li> Natural looking. Loved them</li>
    <li> As described. The quality for the price can&#x27;t be beat. These are perfect if you want something slightly dramatic but not over the top. I use these for special occasions like weddings etc...  Much cheaper on amazon than in my local drugstore.  I generally prefer Ardell lashes over Red Cherry as they seem more natural and the texture of the lashes are a little softer. Will buy again when these are used up.</li>
    <li> Love these! I love the 4 pack! They were very inexpensive and cheaper to buy them together this way then separate. Love the wispy quality and love how flexible they are to apply!</li>
    <li> These look sooo natural! I wear them every day. First I apply some black pencil liner, then use dark glue and glue them on-you can&#x27;t even tell that they&#x27;re fake. So much better than mascara. Mascara really irritates my eyes and this is a safe and healthy alternative when done correctly(glued to lid(Lash line) and not to lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have tried several other different styles of falsies and I believe these are the best. Natural looking but not too natural looking. Long enough to make a difference but not uncomfortably so.</li>
    <li> I have bought this item multiple times and will continue to do so.  My favorite lashes.</li>
    <li> Eye lushes look natural. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I love ardell lashes! If I have no choice but to buy lashes in store instead of online ardell would of course be my first pick. They&#x27;re so up to par with red cherry lashes etc., if you don&#x27;t want to spend bunches on red cherrys I would go for these. This lash# is natural with a wing to help lift your eyes without being dramatic.</li>
    <li> These lashes are awesome,I have naturally long lashes but I like getting these for volume and they look so natural and blend with my lashes so well, my absolute favorite lashes ever. Awesome seller it came in 3 days !</li>
    <li> My favorite lashes ever. They&#x27;re long but that&#x27;s why I love them</li>
    <li> Love them! Such gorgeous lashes !</li>
</ol>
