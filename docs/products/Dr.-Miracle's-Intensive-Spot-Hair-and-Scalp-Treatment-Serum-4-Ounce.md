      <li>This product is amazing for my hair.</li>
      <li>Came fast and works really good!</li>
      <li>Yes I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Better smell.</li>
      <li>IS MORE HELTH.</li>
      <li>My edges, however continue to take a beating because though I have hair I like the versatility of a wig, I have a best friend that braids hair and on a good day I love a pony so needless to say, I contribute most of the growth from getting perms only twice a year and keeping my hair in braids and wigs.</li>
      <li>Its very tingly on the scalp and the smell is nice, a little strong but nice.</li>
      <li>It also properly packed, which I love.</li>
      <li>I have recommended this product to others because it really does work!</li>
      <li>For that reason alone, when they stopped selling it in my local stores I came to Amazon (they never fail) to get some more.</li>
      <li>I live by these products even though i do not hve a perm - i am mixed and i LOVE mostly all black hair products formulated to hyrdating my hair , this stuff aways works magic</li>
      <li>If my hair is straight</li>
      <li>This product works really well for my hair.  </li>
      <li>so I never gave this any real thought until now.</li>
      <li>I wait until I am ready to pull it up in a ponytail before applying it to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She is older and has some issues with thinning, the serum hasn&#x27;t helped with that as much as she&#x27;d like</li>
      <li>and I have yet experienced any results, what I have experienced is small bumps growing on my scalp instead and they are quite painful.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair it will weigh it down in straight styles.  </li>
      <li>Right now, I just need some lubrication because not even vaseline mixed with Glovers is doing the trick.</li>
      <li>After a month, my hair is healthier and have noticed some new growth.</li>
      <li>I put this spot treatment on my scalp daily or every other day and it helps keep my scalp healthy and keeps it from being itchy.  </li>
      <li>The product came quickly and before its expected arrival.</li>
      <li>My hair never grew that fast prior to using the product.  </li>
      <li>I only get cuts twice a year, so I really give my hair the opportunity to grow by not chopping it off every couple of months.  </li>
      <li>If I wear my hair natural</li>
      <li>very good,for dry hair specially for African hair!&lt;br /&gt; just has a strong smell which for some might be bad others wont mind!</li>

<li> Dry hair is one of the major causes of breakage and this stuff keeps my hair lubricated.</li>
<li> My review is slightly different because I don&#x27;t necessarily use this product for hair growth (even though my edges can stand it due to all the tension braiding, ponys and wigs have caused).</li>
<li> The product was just a complete waste of my money and time.</li>
<li> Because of the medications I was on my hair started thin and became very brittle.  </li>
<li> but my hair is now past my shoulders and is still growing (I use the entire line of Dr Miracle)</li>
<li> please dont waste your money, it didnt work.</li>
<li> I guess after reading the reviews I will pay attention to my edges for a few months and update my review.</li>
<li> Please note, it is a bit heavy.  </li>
<li> I just took my hair down this weekend and noticed how thick my hair has gotten and it has grown out a lot as well.  </li>
<li> There are lesser expensive options out there.</li>
<li> I am usually a fan of Dr.</li>
<li> within a year it was past my shoulders.  </li>
<li> I followed the instructions and instead of making my hair grow, small bumps formed in the area which turned to scabs</li>
<li> It has one disadvantage - it is rinsed out hard by shampoo.</li>
<li> my thin edges never filled in.</li>
<li> my slow growth problem areas didnt improve as well.  </li>
<li> Again, my edges continue to get the worst from all of this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item came on time. It was recommended by a friend of mine as my edges were not growing back after several times of braiding my hair. This serum works great as my edges are growing once again.</li>
    <li> very good,for dry hair specially for African hair!&lt;br /&gt; just has a strong smell which for some might be bad others wont mind!</li>
    <li> please dont waste your money, it didnt work. i used as directed, morning and evening on the scalp. my thin edges never filled in. my slow growth problem areas didnt improve as well.  please save your money</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT EVERY DAY..HAIR IS COME BACK AROUND MY EDGES AND HAIR IS MORE HELTH. HAIRDRESSER COMMENTED THAT MY HAIR LOOK THICKER AND NOT BREAKAGE</li>
    <li> This product is garbage. I followed the instructions and instead of making my hair grow, small bumps formed in the area which turned to scabs and my hair fell out.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for my hair.  I have been wearing my hair in braids under a wig.  I put this spot treatment on my scalp daily or every other day and it helps keep my scalp healthy and keeps it from being itchy.  I just took my hair down this weekend and noticed how thick my hair has gotten and it has grown out a lot as well.  I have recommended this product to others because it really does work!</li>
    <li> My review is slightly different because I don&#x27;t necessarily use this product for hair growth (even though my edges can stand it due to all the tension braiding, ponys and wigs have caused). I work out a lot and my hair is on the thicker side and sops up anything I put on it except this oil. This seems to be the only stuff that keeps my hair lubricated. For that reason alone, when they stopped selling it in my local stores I came to Amazon (they never fail) to get some more. Dry hair is one of the major causes of breakage and this stuff keeps my hair lubricated. I do have to say though I used to wear my hair tapered on the sides and back in a very short cut but my hair is now past my shoulders and is still growing (I use the entire line of Dr Miracle) but I never had any issues with growing my hair so I never gave this any real thought until now. My edges, however continue to take a beating because though I have hair I like the versatility of a wig, I have a best friend that braids hair and on a good day I love a pony so needless to say, I contribute most of the growth from getting perms only twice a year and keeping my hair in braids and wigs. Again, my edges continue to get the worst from all of this. I guess after reading the reviews I will pay attention to my edges for a few months and update my review. Right now, I just need some lubrication because not even vaseline mixed with Glovers is doing the trick.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for my hair. Of cause it doesn&#x27;t make miracles like breakage, but it helps me well with my scalp problems. It has one disadvantage - it is rinsed out hard by shampoo.</li>
    <li> Came fast and works really good!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now.  I have experienced amazing results.  I cut my hair very short (above my ears) and within a year it was past my shoulders.  My hair never grew that fast prior to using the product.  Everyone comments on my hair now.  I only get cuts twice a year, so I really give my hair the opportunity to grow by not chopping it off every couple of months.  My hair dresser asked me if I had a weave!!  The hair dresser!! I have gotten used to that question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom uses it as well and has experienced hair growth.  She is older and has some issues with thinning, the serum hasn&#x27;t helped with that as much as she&#x27;d like but it did give her length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now a part of my regular hair routine.  Please note, it is a bit heavy.  If you have fine hair it will weigh it down in straight styles.  If your hair is curly it will prob drink it up the way mine does.  If I wear my hair natural I use it daily.  If my hair is straight I wait until I am ready to pull it up in a ponytail before applying it to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my 2 cents... I am a devotee.</li>
    <li> I went through surgery last year. Because of the medications I was on my hair started thin and became very brittle.  As soon as I started using the serum, I noticed a difference in my hair texture.  After a month, my hair is healthier and have noticed some new growth.</li>
    <li> Yes I love it. My hair is growing back</li>
    <li> There are lesser expensive options out there.</li>
    <li> I live by these products even though i do not hve a perm - i am mixed and i LOVE mostly all black hair products formulated to hyrdating my hair , this stuff aways works magic</li>
    <li> I love this product. It definitely helps prevent hair breakage.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Better smell.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. It will cause hair loss instead of growth, and damage to the remainder that is there.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! Its very tingly on the scalp and the smell is nice, a little strong but nice. It works great on the ends of hair and on the body too!</li>
    <li> Started using this product about two weeks ago and I have yet experienced any results, what I have experienced is small bumps growing on my scalp instead and they are quite painful. The product was just a complete waste of my money and time. I am usually a fan of Dr.Miracles products but not anymore , I will definitely discontinue using it. And yes , I did everything I was suppose to I followed all directions and in the end got bumps on my scalp. Never again.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and before its expected arrival. Took about a week. It also properly packed, which I love. This is an awesome product for hair growth. You will see results within months. Ensure that you a massage into scalp, to prevent it from running.</li>
    <li> Love the tingle good smell it works wonderful</li>
    <li> I have never seen this Dr. Miracle product on the store shelves.  I have been using it for about a month and it&#x27;s great.</li>
