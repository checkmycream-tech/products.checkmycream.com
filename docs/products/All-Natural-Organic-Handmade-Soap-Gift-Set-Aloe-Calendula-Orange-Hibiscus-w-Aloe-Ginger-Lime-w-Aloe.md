    <li> Gift for a family member who has everything.  She loves it, is an nice indulgent gift for someone you do not know what you could possibly give them that they don&#x27;t already have.  Small soaps, cute box w/bow, and they smell very nice.  The amazon box smelled lovely just coming out of the mailbox.</li>
    <li> ok arrived on time was good</li>
    <li> These soaps are very fragrant. I bought several as gifts. The scents are very nice.</li>
    <li> These soaps are pretty but tiny, tiny, tiny.  I won&#x27;t be getting them again.</li>
    <li> I am a housewife with three kids. I constantly wash my hands throughout the day. These beautiful soaps may be be too luxurious for washing hands but they really saved my dry skin. Washing hands become so enjoyable because of their natural lovely scents!!</li>
    <li> much smaller than I had anticipated</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift.  Based on the pix expected soap that you could use for bath.  Nope.  These are child size.  You know the little &amp;#34;chips&amp;#34; of soap you get at a hotel?  These are only slightly larger.  For the price, this was a rip off.  We still gave it as a gift and did not even get an acknowledgement from the recipient.  Honestly, it seemed cheap.  I was very disappointed.  They did smell nice, hence the extra star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, these should be at least 3x bigger.</li>
    <li> Did not like this very much. Seemed very harsh on my skin.</li>

    <li> I bought the All Natural / Organic Handmade Soap Gift Set as a gift for my Real Estate agent and she an her daughters thought it was just &amp;#34;fabulous&amp;#34; (her words).  I will give a Bubblee Soap again and continue to use it.</li>
