<li> I used two tubes of this fantastic product on my thirty year old, purple, ugly stretch marks.</li>
<li> so I had really dark purple deep stretch marks that I could not get rid of with any product!</li>
<li> I have tried it for 3 months with absolutely NO, ZERO results.</li>
<li> I have stretch marks from lifting weights under my legs and a few above my buttocks hip line from losing weight.  </li>
<li> has not really worked at all</li>
<li> It helped with this dark line I had</li>
<li> I used the product during my 2010 pregnancy however 2009 after my surgery I had sagging wrinkle and dark stretchmarks after a while it lighting up</li>
<li> I had stretch marks for over 20 years due to my heavy weightlifting as a teenager.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this cream on several scars from a c - section and serious burn.</li>
<li> I am embarrassed to have stretch marks because I am a guy and guys don’t get them typically.</li>
<li> This product is not better than any other product.</li>
<li> After my son was born, they were still there and they were very dark and visible.</li>
<li> A waste of money.</li>
<li> After using this product for a few months I noticed that the marks were still there</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste money on product.</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money.</li>
<li> My dark and visible stretch marks became just faint white marks on my skin.</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love the new Trilastin Maximum strength stretch Mark cream.I had stretch marks for over 20 years due to my heavy weightlifting as a teenager.I started using trilastin maximum strength 6 months ago in combination with emu oil and drinking lemon water every morning and night,i&#x27;ve gotten great results.I wake up in the moring and drink 8 ounces of room temperature water with the juice from 1/2 lemon.I then take a hot shower,Gently exfoliating my stretch marks with a loofah.I dry myself off,then apply my trilastin cream followed by the emu oil.I repeat the same routine before I go to bed.my stretch marks were white and silvery,but after using this product for 6 months my stretch marks have diminished in size and visibility.Great product.</li>
    <li> This product works!!!</li>
    <li> has not really worked at all this is alot of money for something that does not work at all</li>
    <li> I still didnt order this product but i&#x27;m thinking of doing so because dark red strech marks have developed on my hands and my legs and i read all of the reviews and some people said it really worked for them and sone said nothing happened and it is of no use so please some one tell me weather the product really works</li>
    <li> I had fresh, bright red stretch marks from my pregnancy and my little one was almost 6 months old before I bought the cream and they had not faded on their own yet.  I used this twice a day after washing and drying the area and saw improvements in the appearance of my stretch marks with in 3 weeks. They are still visible but now they are silver instead of red, which is a lot of improvement for 3 weeks!!! I&#x27;m happy with this product and will keep using it in hopes that it will keep improving long term too!  I will give it 5 stars if my stretch marks ever vanish completely! Ha! I did buy and use the trilastin &amp;#34;hydrothermal accelerator cream&amp;#34; too, it has a warming sensation and feels like its making it work!</li>
    <li> did not like the product. It did not work. I noticed on some of my orders. I asked for two days. It takes about for days. To receive my orderthis product is very expensive</li>
    <li> how it works i am assuming it tightens the skin, thats on if the stretch marks are on your stomach but i have mine in legs and my legs are toned so didn&#x27;t work for me if you have more flabby are this will def work</li>
    <li> It made my stretch marks less harsh which is good.</li>
    <li> It did nothing at all. My stretch marks look the exact same. It was a complete waste of my time and money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve started using it and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed changes. Wish the tube would last a bit longer though.</li>
    <li> This cream is the bomb!!!remember when using this try getting the derma roller also, it works even faster. Love it</li>
    <li> I have literally used this product 2x day faithfully from June 1st until present (along with dry brushing and a derma roller). I have seen NO results! Don&#x27;t waste money on product. If it didn&#x27;t cost so much then i would throw it away. So, i&#x27;m using it as lotion until bottle is finished. I have also been using Merderma on the opposite side of body, for which ive notice a visible difference in depth of stretchmarks.</li>
    <li> This product is so useless. I have tried it for 3 months with absolutely NO, ZERO results. I was really hopeful it would work. This product is not better than any other product. They are all useless.</li>
    <li> Product did not meet my expectations. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 4 weeks, twice daily as directed. My stretch marks still look the same.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of products and have been really disappointed with all of them until I bought this product. I am embarrassed to have stretch marks because I am a guy and guys don’t get them typically. I would like to say my stretch marks are from lifting weights but they are from weight gain and not loss. Anyway I see a pretty big difference so far and I am just about out and need to order more. I hope the 2nd tube gives as big of a difference as the first tube has.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried literally everything to rid of my stretch marks. From creams to home made concoctions and they have all been unsuccessful. I will honestly tell you if you want to get rid of them buy a derma roller. When you get a cut what happens? You get a nasty scab for a few weeks then new skin forms and it&#x27;s healed. The derma roller is a roller with small needles that penetrate the skin so new skin can form. This process always helps penetrate the deeper levels of the skin to allow for your lotion to get into those deeper levels and really heal the stretch marks. before I discovered the derma roller I used just triLastin and I was shocked at how well it worked. Now that I am using this and the derma roller the results are seriously mind blowing. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you have red or purple strech marks BUY THIS it will take about 3 to 5 months for them to fade and what you will be left with is the scars. I am telling you this from experience. Now i am looking for something to remove the scars. This is a really good product though.</li>
    <li> I have used trilastin after 2 pregnancies. It does work really great. I was really surprised after a while of me using it. It helped with this dark line I had and it really did reduce my stretch marks. I would recommended. They also have great cs.</li>
    <li> I used two tubes of this fantastic product on my thirty year old, purple, ugly stretch marks. After the first tube they lightened to a pink-ish red and were a lot less transparent. After the second tube, they were a lighter pink color and the indentations from the marks seemed to fill in considerably.  Can&#x27;t wait to get started on my third tube!  This product did something that no other product I&#x27;ve used on my stretch marks ever did- IT ACTUALLY WORKED!  Considering I&#x27;m fifty-four years old, I think this is pretty amazing!  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic! I&#x27;ve used this cream on several scars from a c - section and serious burn. Significantly reduced the appearance of both.  Not to mention the benefits I&#x27;ve noticed on my stretch marks! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This product is not working at all!  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I applied this product twice a day for three months on stretch marks that were on my left abdomen and breast.  After 3 months, I did not see any difference between the left and right side.  My strectchmarks are old and are from having children (current ages are 5 &amp; 7).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to return the item through Amazon.  That process was easy!  Unfortunately, there is a restocking fee (which is weird because the tube was empty) and shipping was not refundable.</li>
    <li> I had a csection in 2009 and vaginal 2010 I used the product during my 2010 pregnancy however 2009 after my surgery I had sagging wrinkle and dark stretchmarks after a while it lighting up and all I had was light wrinkle stretchmarks the ones on my sides are light and thick the ones on my belly are skinny and light I used this product and it lighten them up a but (even tho it took almost 2 months to see results) but i still have those nasty wrinkles other then that this product worked for me also drinking a lot of water while using this speeds up the process and water your strecthmarks as well 😊</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money. I bought it and used it for about a month! and no changes at all. Seriously what a waste of money. I felt so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have tried yet. I have always struggled with stretch marks that makes my skin feel very sensitive. This cream has reduced the appearance of my stretch marks and has also reduced the sensitivity of the area. I recommend this product 100%. Occasionally they do buy 1 get 1 free promo, great deal!! Worth the $$.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything! I wanted this to work sooo bad. I have purchased 6 bottles and used it faithfully twice a day after exfoliating for a good 6 months. Stretch marks didn&#x27;t fade at all! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I had my children 18+ years ago so I assumed the Stretch marks/scars would be there forever. I purchased this product and within weeks the change was noticeable. After six months many were hardly noticeable. I am positive that continued use will totally resolve my problem. Thanks to Trilastin I am feeling a lot more confident about my body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and i works great. I have noticed that my stretches mark are fading out. This is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after the birth of my son. I wish I had known about this product sooner, especially during my pregnancy. I developed stretch marks all over my stomach. After my son was born, they were still there and they were very dark and visible. A few months after my son was born was when I discovered TriLastin-SR through an internet search of best products for stretch marks. I started really noticing a difference after a month of using this product. My dark and visible stretch marks became just faint white marks on my skin. I continue to faithfully use this product because everything I had used prior did not work for me. I am extremely pleased with this product. I have been using it for almost two years now. I continue using it because after the birth of my son, I developed new stretch marks from working out. This product is best used with the Hydro-Thermal Accelerator.</li>
    <li> I have stretch marks from lifting weights under my legs and a few above my buttocks hip line from losing weight.  I have tried various creams and oils and nothing really seemed to work.  However, I have been using TriLASTIN-SR for approximately a year now with hopes it would work based on what I had read about the product.  Here are my results:  The stretch marks on my legs had deep impressions and were very noticeable to me.  After using this product for a few months I noticed that the marks were still there but they had faded significantly.  If you are expecting this product to get rid of the stretch marks its not going to happen. But it is a great product for reducing the stretch mark appearance; therefore, you now have to be searching for them because they are much fainter.</li>
    <li> I gained the freshman fifteen this year when I went away to school. And even though I&#x27;m back to my normal size and weight, I was still left with the stretch marks to remind me of it. After using this they are almost completely gone, and I have only been using it for a month!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love!!!! Lol, I LOVE this stuff! I had twins and that left me with terrible stretch marks that were so large and annoying. This stuff actually works! I noticed the first couple of times trying it that it was fantastic!</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product. It works well on me , after having my son i was not so confident with my belly, because of triLastin i am so happy now. Thank you so much TriLastin!</li>
    <li> So disappointed.  I have been patiently using for the last month, 3 times a day as direction. No improvement at all even though my stretch mark is very recent. Waste of money</li>
    <li> today is February 24th 2015 I started this product 3 weeks ago today. I developed stretch marks when I got pregnant and then I lost about almost 100 pounds in a year so I had really dark purple deep stretch marks that I could not get rid of with any product! I tried Mederma the bio oil &amp; coconut lotion nothing worked!! so then I went to get laser surgery but when I went for my meeting with the doctor he took pictures and then they called me later that afternoon with a price quote and he had it at $600 an arm which is where I wanted to start. I have them on my arms and my legs.  I&#x27;d probably would need two to three treatments on each arm so you&#x27;re looking at $1200 for both arms for one treatment so that was crazy expensive to me and I was like I&#x27;m never going to have the money for that so I did more research and I came across this product which I got great reviews on from this site and from the actual site. so I decided to try it and like I said its been 3 weeks and I love it so far I can totally tell a difference with my stretch marks they have definitely lightened up I only give it three stars because it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks and I still want more they still have a little ways to go so I&#x27;ll definitely be writing another review maybe in like a month or so I&#x27;m going to give it probably 5 months and then go from there and see if it&#x27;s where I want it to be. also I am ud ing the derma roller 1 a month!</li>
