      <li>This is a cream and thus heavier than most lotions but not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>The Tree Hut product smells more like chocolate chip cookies.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My feet have never looked better or been healthier.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>This is a great, highly moisturizing body butter.  </li>
      <li>This Tree Hut Body Cream in Brazilian Nut Scent is the best I&#x27;ve tried &amp; I&#x27;ve tried many looking for something to moisturize &amp; soothe my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s rich and goes on smooth, and you don&#x27;t need tons of it!</li>
      <li>It has a great scent and almost instantly smooths my skin.</li>
      <li>It smells good enough to eat, although I wouldn&#x27;t advise it!  :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great on my feet as well because I have EXTREMELY DRY SKIN.</li>
      <li>I had tried EVERYTHING - stuff from special shops, even beeswax, but nothing could heal my skin.</li>
      <li>sweet yet luscious.  </li>
      <li>, BECUASE IT GIVES YOU A SORT OF SWEET CHOCOLATEY SMELL.</li>
      <li>the first thing that hooked me was the smell, but then I found the cream went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t feel greasy to me at all.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting my rashed hands (like lotion does), and it feels soooo good on dry skin.</li>
      <li>The packaging is different (looks better), but the stuff inside is the same rich, heavenly-smelling, deeply-moisturising body butter we loved so much.</li>
      <li>is super soft.</li>
      <li>It has a great heavy cream texture but body heat melts it almost instantly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of this cream, especially the scent.</li>
      <li>I really like the Body Shop&#x27;s \\&quot;Nut\\&quot; Body Butter.  </li>
      <li>Like really, I smell like a goddess and my skin</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really specify, and I couldn&#x27;t find much on the web soooo...   &lt;br</li>
      <li>the smell really does make you want to eat it....</li>
      <li>In contrast, the Tree Hut product seems very waxy.  </li>
      <li>and  reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Will absolutely get this product again.</li>
      <li>Nut butter literally makes my skin smooth and heals it while maintaining a moisturized level till the next time I shower</li>
      <li>It was on the bottom shelf at Wal-Mart and I picked it up because it was one of the few that listed Shea butter in the top three ingredients.</li>
      <li>Even now it&#x27;s in pretty short supply (or high demand).</li>
      <li>I also like the kiwi, mango, and now the new lime-coconut scent.</li>
      <li>my skin is so soft!  </li>
      <li>It makes my dry hands feel super soft</li>
      <li>IT MAKES MY SKIN SOOOO SOFT</li>

      <li>and I just love how thick and creamy it is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely, creamy, thick, decadent!</li>
      <li>, their TEXTURES are no where near the same.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is very thick and like real butter, it melts right into your skin.  </li>
      <li>really disappointed because it smells GREAT.  </li>

<li> really disappointed because it smells GREAT.  </li>
<li> This is a MUST have for people like me who have major dry skin.</li>
<li> Body butters with half the natural ingredients are selling for four time the amount.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also tried the Coconut Lime scent, which I don&#x27;t like as much due to the lime overtone, but it works the same.</li>
<li> This time of year I could start a fire, my skin is so dry.</li>
<li> IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN</li>
<li> (I can literally go days without dry skin).</li>
<li> I have a problem with extremely dry and cracked feet - have had it all my life.  </li>
<li> a co-worker commented on the yummy smell when I sat down next to her at 1:30PM.</li>
<li> Especially when those do not fit in to your budget.</li>
<li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
<li> If you like body butters from other shops.</li>
<li> The scent is unbelievable, definitely one of my favorites.  </li>
<li> Also, after a few minutes, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;dry down\\&quot; the way the Body Shop version does.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quite hard at room temperature, and is fairly similar to trying to spread too-cold butter onto something.  </li>
<li> With just a few applications, I noticed a 75% improvement.  </li>
<li> I went looking for the plain ole shea butter at Target</li>
<li> Very little residue but an enduring fragrance.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a dog groomer, which means that my feet and my hands get soaked in water and detergent all day long, and especially with the winter cold, this obviously dries my skin badly.</li>
<li> Like another reviewer, I tried this as a less expensive alternative (on a whim) to body butter (coconut scent) by the Body Shop.</li>
<li> IT IS ALSO VERY THICK AND CREAMY</li>
<li> Have also shared my secret with family and friends...</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s $17 a tub.  </li>
<li> (unfortunately it makes me want to eat it!).</li>
<li> Dude, this junk is insane.</li>

    <li> Dude, this junk is insane. Like really, I smell like a goddess and my skin is super soft. I love it.</li>
    <li> It is such a shame that you have discontinued the brazilian shea butter.  I hope that you will reconsider and bring more of it out</li>
    <li> If you like body butters from other shops. You will find this one works as well. Especially when those do not fit in to your budget.</li>
    <li> This body cream is great - it&#x27;s rich and goes on smooth, and you don&#x27;t need tons of it! Also, it smells SO good (everyone I know agrees on this), almost like a mocha (unfortunately it makes me want to eat it!). Definately reccomend!</li>
    <li> I discovered this product at Target when looking for a replacement for the Body Shop Nut Butter I had been using for ages,and had just ran out of....the first thing that hooked me was the smell, but then I found the cream went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t feel greasy to me at all. I had no problem with it feeling \\&quot;chapstick\\&quot;ish, but then I am warm blooded. I also like the kiwi, mango, and now the new lime-coconut scent.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS BODY CREAM FOR OVER 2 YEARS NOW, ALMOST EVERY DAY. I LOVE IT. IT SMELLS SO DARN GOOD, I WANT TO EAT IT. IT SMELLS LIKE BUTTER PECAN ICE CREAM. IT IS ALSO VERY THICK AND CREAMY SO A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. ITS PERFECT IN REPLACEMENT OF PERFUME, BECUASE IT GIVES YOU A SORT OF SWEET CHOCOLATEY SMELL. IT MAKES MY SKIN SOOOO SOFT TOO. IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN AND YOU LOVE THE WAY COOKIE DOE SMELLS, THEN GET THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This Tree Hut Body Cream in Brazilian Nut Scent is the best I&#x27;ve tried &amp; I&#x27;ve tried many looking for something to moisturize &amp; soothe my dry skin.  This stuff works so good-my skin is so soft!  I can&#x27;t stop putting it on because it smells SO GOOD!!!  The scent is unbelievable, definitely one of my favorites.  I also have the Coconut Lime which I enjoy too, but the Brazilian Nut is just \\&quot;HEAVENLY!!\\&quot;  YUMMMMMM!  It smells good enough to eat, although I wouldn&#x27;t advise it!  :)</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the reviewer who had to hold them selves back from eating this stuff...it is addictive.  I love Brazil Nuts any way, so, it&#x27;s irresistable!  I&#x27;m a very picky guy and this stuff is awesome. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!! YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By the way; does anyone know what kind of glycerin is used in this?  Doesn&#x27;t really specify, and I couldn&#x27;t find much on the web soooo...   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Adios!</li>
    <li> This is a great, highly moisturizing body butter.  The consistency is very thick and like real butter, it melts right into your skin.  Leaving your skin supple, but not greasy.  The scent is wonderful and not at all over-powering.  It smells like a whipped, baking confection- sweet yet luscious.  Read the ingredient listing, you can not beat the quality.  Body butters with half the natural ingredients are selling for four time the amount.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I could do to keep from wanting to spread this stuff on a piece of toast.  It smell SO DARN GOOD that I put it on before I go to bed, so I can go to sleep smelling it.  I have the Mango cream too, but the Nut Gream is the BEST!  I think everyone should try this stuff!</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels good going on, and stops my legs from itching. &lt;br /&gt;Non greasy or staining</li>
    <li> I have a problem with extremely dry and cracked feet - have had it all my life.  I have tried EVERY product out there in every cost range and nothing comes close to this product.  NOTHING.  With just a few applications, I noticed a 75% improvement.  My feet have never looked better or been healthier.  Buy this and use it with confidence.</li>
    <li> I have also been using this skin cream for 2 years. I have severe problem skin, scaling skin and eczema when I use any product with synthetic fragrance. Nut butter literally makes my skin smooth and heals it while maintaining a moisturized level till the next time I shower (I can literally go days without dry skin).</li>
    <li> Iowa winds and temperature extremes do a number on my skin. I found this product by accident, when I discovered my boyfriend&#x27;s house to be without moisturizer. It was on the bottom shelf at Wal-Mart and I picked it up because it was one of the few that listed Shea butter in the top three ingredients. I bought it because it smelled like caramel (which happens to be the last ingredient listed). Now I have pots stashed everywhere. It&#x27;s a shea butter bargain, ringing up just over $5 with tax. It has a great heavy cream texture but body heat melts it almost instantly. Very little residue but an enduring fragrance. I put it on after my shower at 6AM and a co-worker commented on the yummy smell when I sat down next to her at 1:30PM.</li>
    <li> I really like the Body Shop&#x27;s \\&quot;Nut\\&quot; Body Butter.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s $17 a tub.  Someone suggested that I might like the Tree Hut version, at a fraction of the price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like the Body Shop version, the Tree Hut Brazillian Nut butter has a very strong fragarance.  They don&#x27;t smell the same -- the Body Shop version smells to me a bit like baking bread.  The Tree Hut product smells more like chocolate chip cookies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, their TEXTURES are no where near the same.  The Body Shop version is creamy and is easly removed from the tub at room temperature.  It glides on to your skin in a nice, thin, layer.  In contrast, the Tree Hut product seems very waxy.  I&#x27;d compare it to trying to rub chap stick on your arms/legs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite hard at room temperature, and is fairly similar to trying to spread too-cold butter onto something.  It&#x27;s sort of lumpy and doesn&#x27;t glide well.  Also, after a few minutes, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;dry down\\&quot; the way the Body Shop version does.  It leaves your skin somewhat sticky/waxy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed because it smells GREAT.  But, I&#x27;m going back to Body Shop.</li>
    <li> THis stuff smells so good you wanna eat it! I went looking for the plain ole shea butter at Target and they were out. I found this stuff by accident. It&#x27;s lovely, creamy, thick, decadent! This time of year I could start a fire, my skin is so dry. This stuff is like GOLD!</li>
    <li> Hope they keep this on the market. It&#x27;s the best  &lt;br /&gt; shea product I&#x27;ve ever used. and  reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I saw this cream on the shelf at Walmart and once I smelled it couldn&#x27;t resist. It smelled sooooo good like it should be spread on a cake or something. It makes my dry hands feel super soft and I just love how thick and creamy it is. It also doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like some creams. It&#x27;s also great on my feet as well because I have EXTREMELY DRY SKIN. I highly reccomend this product!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dog groomer, which means that my feet and my hands get soaked in water and detergent all day long, and especially with the winter cold, this obviously dries my skin badly. I had tried EVERYTHING - stuff from special shops, even beeswax, but nothing could heal my skin. Finally, one day, I bought this stuff at Wal-Mart on a whim, AND IT WORKS!!! It doesn&#x27;t sting my rashed hands (like lotion does), and it feels soooo good on dry skin. Not to mention it smells like heaven! This is a MUST have for people like me who have major dry skin. You&#x27;ll regret it if you don&#x27;t buy it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Just picked this product up from Wal-Mart actually and I love it. It has a great scent and almost instantly smooths my skin. Will absolutely get this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this cream, especially the scent. Like another reviewer, I tried this as a less expensive alternative (on a whim) to body butter (coconut scent) by the Body Shop. It has a nutty oppose to coconut fragrance but I like both just the same. To me, they both perform the same. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer after a bath or shower. I&#x27;ve also tried the Coconut Lime scent, which I don&#x27;t like as much due to the lime overtone, but it works the same. I buy it retail around $[...]. This is a cream and thus heavier than most lotions but not greasy at all. Since I have oily skin on my face, I only use it for the body. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tree Hut Body Butter for a couple years.  Love the way it makes my skin feel...keeps me moisturizes (not oily or sticky).  It smells great too!  Have also shared my secret with family and friends...they love it too!</li>
    <li> Yes!! Somebody at Tree Hut listened to all of us who were wailing at the loss of this product. The packaging is different (looks better), but the stuff inside is the same rich, heavenly-smelling, deeply-moisturising body butter we loved so much. My one caveat for this product is: If you find it somewhere, stock up. Even now it&#x27;s in pretty short supply (or high demand). Thank you, Tree Hut!</li>
    <li> this stuff is great!! the smell really does make you want to eat it....im flipping out b/c im scraping the jar as we speak!</li>
