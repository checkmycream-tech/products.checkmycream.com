      <li>I use it everyday and it is so wonderful</li>
      <li>A good haircare system saved me from the pixie I dreaded as my only alternative!</li>

      <li>Give Pro Naturals a try, it certainly made me happier!</li>
      <li>thanks you Pro Naturals!</li>
      <li>After using Pro Naturals Moroccan Argan Oil Hair Repair System, I have most definitely seen an improvement in the appearance of the texture of my hair.</li>
      <li>More than just shampoo and conditioner, I believe it’s the oil and mask treatment that help to transform your hair into a shiny mane and back to it</li>
      <li>These products small absolutely lovely and better yet, really do work as promised.</li>
      <li>I have been using the oil almost everyday as it really makes my hair look good.</li>
      <li>I really love the leave in oil as it leaves my hair super shiny without weighing it down and it works to protect my hair from heat damage.</li>
      <li>After the first use we were able to comb through her hair no problem and the leave in oil left her curls looking soft and shiny and no frizz!</li>
      <li>I have fine waivy/curly hair, and this brought life back to my curls.</li>
      <li>My hair looks amazing, everyday.</li>
      <li>This product has done in, even on humid days my hair stays straight and silky.</li>
      <li>I straighten my hair out all the time, and always had a problem with it staying straight and shiny during the humid days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m regretting that I paid so much for it.</li>
      <li>My hair is much softer and shinier than before</li>
      <li>I have very curly mid-length hair that has been over processed after years of dying and blow drying.</li>
      <li>I bought the leave in oil to try first as I normally do not spend this much on hair care but after a week of using the oil and noticing a huge change in how my hair looked and felt, I splurged and bought the kit.</li>
      <li>As someone who styles my hair daily I have used a lot of different products to help keep my hair nourished and healthy.</li>
      <li>Overall, the product does help my curly, frizzy hair, but it&#x27;s most likely caused by the silicone coating the hair.</li>
      <li>(Yanking on it with a brush while blow drying at high setting didn&#x27;t help any, either.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone with damaged hair.</li>
      <li>Pro Naturals has really helped with my split ends and makes my hair feel soft again.</li>
      <li>It definitely feels better when it&#x27;s wet, and it dries looking much healthier.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, hydrated and feels lightweight.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re trying to stay away from silicone completely this is not the product for you.</li>
      <li>I just started using this hair care product and so far I like the way my hair feels.  </li>
      <li>I completely damaged my hair</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair conditioned, soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>These products work as promised and have really transformed my hair from dull and lifeless to soft, shiny and full of life.</li>
      <li>I am currently only using the hair mask, but only because I dont want to waste it and cannot afford more yet.  </li>
      <li>This line has made my dry, brittle hair look and feel much softer than it did before I started using Pro Naturals.</li>
      <li>I recently got a haircut that left much to be desired.</li>
      <li>No other hair treatment beats moraccan oil.</li>
      <li>For as expensive as it was and how it was described, I thought this product would be amazing...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used my Pro Natural only once ..can&#x27;t say yet if its okey.</li>
      <li>and I also find my hair to be much less frizzy and the leave in oil really smooths my curls without leaving my hair looking oil.</li>
      <li>I have to admit I was a little concerned about spending so much</li>
      <li>I have to admit I was a little nervous about spending so much on a hair care system and also worried about it making my hair oily.</li>

<li> No offense to the black people that use Jheri curl or afro sheen</li>
<li> All the little frizzies created by heat damage seem to be somewhat healed.</li>
<li> In fact, I could tell no difference between its effect on my hair and other, less expensive shampoos and conditioners, such as Pantene or even Suave.</li>
<li> My hair had been looking dull and lifeless until I came across this system.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair the next day to rid myself of that nasty smell.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the conditioner contains Dimethicone, a form a silicone.</li>
<li> It had a bad smell to it.</li>
<li> Boy was I wrong!!</li>
<li> I have to admit I HATE the smell of it.  </li>
<li> It is way over priced and worthless.</li>

    <li> Pro Naturals is an excellent line of hair care in which I have been using faithfully for a few months now. These products work as promised and have really transformed my hair from dull and lifeless to soft, shiny and full of life. Its amazing what great looking hair can do for ones self esteem, as I constantly get compliments on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
    <li> I recently got a haircut that left much to be desired. (MUCH to be desired!!) I&#x27;ve had several haircuts since to shape it into the look I wanted, but in-between, I overdid the curling iron and flat iron attempts to hide the choppy look. (Yanking on it with a brush while blow drying at high setting didn&#x27;t help any, either. And, ohhh... the damage I did to my hair. After using Pro Naturals Moroccan Argan Oil Hair Repair System, I have most definitely seen an improvement in the appearance of the texture of my hair. All the little frizzies created by heat damage seem to be somewhat healed. It definitely feels better when it&#x27;s wet, and it dries looking much healthier. A good haircare system saved me from the pixie I dreaded as my only alternative! Give Pro Naturals a try, it certainly made me happier! Sample provided and well-appreciated!</li>

I&#x27;m regretting that I paid so much for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair care set for my daughter who has frizzy, uncontrollable curls which are constantly tangled. After the first use we were able to comb through her hair no problem and the leave in oil left her curls looking soft and shiny and no frizz! We love it!</li>
    <li> I loved this product. My hair had been looking dull and lifeless until I came across this system. I have fine waivy/curly hair, and this brought life back to my curls.</li>
    <li> For as expensive as it was and how it was described, I thought this product would be amazing... Boy was I wrong!! I can usually deal with any kind of shampoo, but this is worse than store bought shampoo... the conditioner wasnt good either.  It had a bad smell to it. I am currently only using the hair mask, but only because I dont want to waste it and cannot afford more yet.  I will not buy this product or advise anyone else to purchase this product.  It is way over priced and worthless.</li>
    <li> I bought this for me and my daughters hair and wow the results are truly amazing, we both noticed results immediately after the first use. They also smell really really good.</li>
    <li> As someone who styles my hair daily I have used a lot of different products to help keep my hair nourished and healthy. Pro Naturals is by far the best at doing this, my hair has never looked so nice. I really love the leave in oil as it leaves my hair super shiny without weighing it down and it works to protect my hair from heat damage.</li>
    <li> This line has made my dry, brittle hair look and feel much softer than it did before I started using Pro Naturals. I also have less hair breakage and fall because my hair is no longer as dry and brittle since using these products. If you are tired of dry hair that breaks too easily, Pro Naturals is your answer.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I heard to many good reviews on it and wanted to try it. I have to admit I was a little concerned about spending so much but since you only use it 1 week every 6 weeks it seemed cheaper then a salon visit. After just my first use I noticed immediate results, my hair was tangle free and very smooth and straight and the results lasted all week even after the first treatment. I have been using the oil almost everyday as it really makes my hair look good. Hands down the best hair treatment I have used.</li>
    <li> I bought this product under the assumption that it was sulfate and silicone free as stated in the product description. Unfortunately, the conditioner contains Dimethicone, a form a silicone. Overall, the product does help my curly, frizzy hair, but it&#x27;s most likely caused by the silicone coating the hair. If you&#x27;re trying to stay away from silicone completely this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> I just started using this hair care product and so far I like the way my hair feels.  A lot of people stated in their reviews that they just LOVED the scent of this.  I have to admit I HATE the smell of it.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair the next day to rid myself of that nasty smell.  I even kept waking up in the night because I stunk!  No offense to the black people that use Jheri curl or afro sheen but this product smells yucky like that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my Pro Natural only once ..can&#x27;t say yet if its okey. Perhaps after a week or so i can comment on the product i purchased.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a little nervous about spending so much on a hair care system and also worried about it making my hair oily. Well after using it I noticed immediate results and it did not make my hair oily at all, it made my hair so soft and healthy looking and easy to brush. I would highly recommend this to anyone with damaged hair.</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy or curly hair and want a sleek and shiny look, this is the product for you!  I use it everyday and it is so wonderful I can’t believe I didn’t try this before.  My hair is soft, hydrated and feels lightweight.  No other hair treatment beats moraccan oil. I tried a lot of cheaper brands before and will be staying with this one.  It is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my well defined curls and smooth hair.  Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Having gone through dozen of products for my thick curly and frizzy hair, I must say this product is absolute best. It leaves my hair conditioned, soft and shiny. I straighten my hair out all the time, and always had a problem with it staying straight and shiny during the humid days. This product has done in, even on humid days my hair stays straight and silky. This product does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> IT WORK AS EXPECTED..</li>
    <li> It is starting to make my hair start to feel softer but slowly. I completely damaged my hair so I assume it will take a little longer for me to get my hair back to normal.</li>
    <li> I bought the leave in oil to try first as I normally do not spend this much on hair care but after a week of using the oil and noticing a huge change in how my hair looked and felt, I splurged and bought the kit. Best investment I have made in a long time!</li>
    <li> I have very curly mid-length hair that has been over processed after years of dying and blow drying. I’ve tried every possible treatment out  there but  Pro Naturals Moroccan Argan Oil Hair Repair System has been truly a goddess experience. My brittle ends and fragile hair has improved drastically since I’ve been using it daily for the last 14 days. More than just shampoo and conditioner, I believe it’s the oil and mask treatment that help to transform your hair into a shiny mane and back to it’s pre-processed form. I haven’t had a frizzy hair day either. I have continued to style and go about my usual hair styles, some days blow drying for example and other days letting my curls air dry and both methods still results in curls I can run my fingers through versus tight kinky mess that used to sit in top of my head. I will definitely be purchasing this hair treatment again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!!!!! it&#x27;s really helping my hair since the first time i used it!!!</li>
