      <li>Also wonderful for a subscribe and save</li>
      <li>You have a toddler you will need many of these!!!</li>
      <li>what good is it if he won&#x27;t let me?!</li>
      <li>I have tried many brand this seem to be the best but still will not hold up</li>
      <li>Very happy with the toothbrush as it fits his hands perfectly as we are teaching oral hygeine at an early age</li>
      <li>good for toddlers.  </li>
      <li>I liked the shape and length of the toothbrush, as well as the softness of the bristles.</li>
      <li>so it fits nicely into his mouth.</li>
      <li>Very happy with these brushes and glad the come in a large pack as I struggle to find these in the stores, plus</li>
      <li>she is two and the size is good for her to hold and &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; her teeth and fine for her mother to brush them after</li>
      <li>He gets excited about being able to brush his teeth like Mommy and Daddy.</li>
      <li>I purchased the pack of eight so that I can easily put out replacements as the toothbrushes in use wear</li>
      <li>Great price through Amazon, since the last place I saw these was at Walmart for WAY more.</li>
      <li>:) I was tired of paying $4 each at Walgreens and this is an EXCELLENT way to get lots of toothbrushes at once.</li>
      <li>and I switch them every 3 months even though they look in good shape due to hygiene.</li>
      <li>Also I think the bristles are more curved downward than is necessary, so that the bristles do not have adequate contact with the teeth.</li>
      <li>The extra soft bristles is a good feature, though.</li>
      <li>I had first purchased the toothbrush in the picture at a store.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why colgate wants to design it this way, which makes no sense.</li>
      <li>and I will use them, but I really wanted the one that is in the picture.</li>
      <li>(He currently has eight teeth completely in--six in front and two molars--and two more molars are poking through.)</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is just the right size for my 1 yr old, he loves using this to brush his teeth.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very practical for a samll kid, he can grasp it and use it successfully, and with a pack of 8, little kid can use it for a  long time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically just a normal toothbrush, so I feel like it probably cleans his teeth better than some of the other ones made for babies/toddlers, but</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these for children under 2.</li>
      <li>Radius Pure Baby Toothbrush, Ultra Soft]]</li>
      <li>(she love giraffes) or if it just fits her little mouth and teeth so well.</li>
      <li>The difference is purely cosmetic, but Amazon really does need to keep its photos current.</li>
      <li>My toddler hates being brushed with this colgate brush (0-2 year old), even if I am very gentle with it.</li>
      <li>Your kiddo will just get to learn a new color when their old brush wears out.</li>
      <li>So far, this is the smallest size toothbrush I have found in the market.</li>
      <li>So far the brushes have held up to his chewing, though the bristles are getting a bit worn.</li>
      <li>My son (17 months old)</li>
      <li>I got these for my 13 month old, we had the crayon crayola ones</li>
      <li>but it does not feel that soft.  </li>
      <li>so when it comes to using real flouride he will have the basic concept of brushing his teeth.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted, only 3 stars because it was the only thing in my package that didn&#x27;t arrive damaged</li>
      <li>but these are just the right size not too long or short for him to hold.</li>
      <li>They are soft, last the chewing and brushing of my 13 month old</li>
      <li>From the description of extra soft, I was expecting a softer bristle</li>
      <li>Right size for little mouths</li>
      <li>so he can be old enough later on and pick whatever other color he wants that is boyish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the fun characters on the handle</li>
      <li>I must say the colors are all colors even pink, so we&#x27;re having him use pink first</li>
      <li>The handle is fat at the handle making it easy for him to hold and thin by the head</li>

<li> The brush, which is made for infants, has no cushion on the head, just regular hard plastic.</li>
<li> Needless to say I was very surprised that the bristles started coming out in her mouth as she was brushing her teeth/chewing on the toothbrush!</li>
<li> We put one in his bathroom, which he usually uses at bedtime, and the other is in our bathroom so that he can brush his teeth with us in the morning.</li>
<li> we bought a few because we go through 1 at least every 1-2 months.  </li>
<li> I let him naw on it since he&#x27;s been cutting teeth for the last two years.  </li>
<li> Plus the head is very small so hard to brush baby teeths in a sweeping motion.</li>
<li> disappointment comes from the fact that what I received is not what is pictured.</li>
<li> The angle between the handle and the neck makes it very awkward for parents to use.</li>

    <li> We bought this toothbrush when my son started getting teeth (he has almost 12 now at 13-1/2 months). He didn&#x27;t mind it in the beginning, but now he hates it.  He cries and tries to get away from it, so I&#x27;m now looking for something else to try.  It&#x27;s basically just a normal toothbrush, so I feel like it probably cleans his teeth better than some of the other ones made for babies/toddlers, but what good is it if he won&#x27;t let me?!</li>
    <li> My 14mo son has been using these toothbrushes for about a month now. He gets excited about being able to brush his teeth like Mommy and Daddy. We put one in his bathroom, which he usually uses at bedtime, and the other is in our bathroom so that he can brush his teeth with us in the morning. So far the brushes have held up to his chewing, though the bristles are getting a bit worn. (He currently has eight teeth completely in--six in front and two molars--and two more molars are poking through.) I purchased the pack of eight so that I can easily put out replacements as the toothbrushes in use wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My disappointment comes from the fact that what I received is not what is pictured. Instead of ducks on the handles, the toothbrushes have zoo animals. The difference is purely cosmetic, but Amazon really does need to keep its photos current. My pack of eight also had three pink toothbrushes, which is not my color preference for my son. I will be canceling my Subscribe &amp; Save shipments based on the inaccurate depiction and inability to select boy colors.</li>
    <li> good for toddlers.  we bought a few because we go through 1 at least every 1-2 months.  this package contains green blue and pink brushes.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 13 month old, we had the crayon crayola ones but these are just the right size not too long or short for him to hold. I must say the colors are all colors even pink, so we&#x27;re having him use pink first so he can be old enough later on and pick whatever other color he wants that is boyish. They are soft, last the chewing and brushing of my 13 month old and I switch them every 3 months even though they look in good shape due to hygiene. I highly recommend these for children under 2.</li>
    <li> I use it to brush my 7-8lb toy poodle&#x27;s teeth. So far, this is the smallest size toothbrush I have found in the market.</li>
    <li> My toddler doesn&#x27;t like these toothbrush &amp; complains that it hurts.  From the description of extra soft, I was expecting a softer bristle but it does not feel that soft.  Plus the head is very small so hard to brush baby teeths in a sweeping motion.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothbrush my daughter will use. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the fun characters on the handle (she love giraffes) or if it just fits her little mouth and teeth so well. She&#x27;s 3 and loves brushing her teeth with her toothbrush. It&#x27;s not too firm, but firm enough to get the job done! Great price through Amazon, since the last place I saw these was at Walmart for WAY more. Also wonderful for a subscribe and save so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my son through Amazon subscribe and save.  Very happy with these brushes and glad the come in a large pack as I struggle to find these in the stores, plus these are way cheaper.  We use this with the Tom&#x27;s flouride toothpast and he loves brushing his teeth.  I let him naw on it since he&#x27;s been cutting teeth for the last two years.  I give it to him when I change him at night and in the morning on the changing table and let him naw on it then when I am done changing him I add the toothpaste and then I brush them for him.  Very happy with the toothbrush as it fits his hands perfectly as we are teaching oral hygeine at an early age so when it comes to using real flouride he will have the basic concept of brushing his teeth.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brand this seem to be the best but still will not hold up afterall it is for brushing not eating it like my son did. You have a toddler you will need many of these!!!</li>
    <li> bought these for my grandaughter she is two and the size is good for her to hold and &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; her teeth and fine for her mother to brush them after</li>
    <li> These are very soft so if your little one loves to brush their teeth like mine, they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This is only the second toothbrush that I have purchased for my daughter. Needless to say I was very surprised that the bristles started coming out in her mouth as she was brushing her teeth/chewing on the toothbrush! The bristles started coming out after about 1 week of use. I will go back to buying the OralB infant toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, only 3 stars because it was the only thing in my package that didn&#x27;t arrive damaged</li>
    <li> My toddler hates being brushed with this colgate brush (0-2 year old), even if I am very gentle with it. The brush, which is made for infants, has no cushion on the head, just regular hard plastic. Ironically, colgate brush for age 5+ has cushion on the brush head. I don&#x27;t understand why colgate wants to design it this way, which makes no sense. Also I think the bristles are more curved downward than is necessary, so that the bristles do not have adequate contact with the teeth. The angle between the handle and the neck makes it very awkward for parents to use. I don&#x27;t like the knobbed shape of the neck, either. The extra soft bristles is a good feature, though. But overall I think this is not a very good product for its purpose.</li>
    <li> My toddler loves to brush her teeth - sometimes five times a day. We go through a LOT of toothbrushes with all her chewing! :) I was tired of paying $4 each at Walgreens and this is an EXCELLENT way to get lots of toothbrushes at once. You don&#x27;t get to choose the colors, which totally doesn&#x27;t matter to us. Your kiddo will just get to learn a new color when their old brush wears out.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is just the right size for my 1 yr old, he loves using this to brush his teeth. The handle is fat at the handle making it easy for him to hold and thin by the head so it fits nicely into his mouth.</li>
    <li> I had first purchased the toothbrush in the picture at a store. I liked the shape and length of the toothbrush, as well as the softness of the bristles. When I saw this 8 pack on Amazon, I purchased them thinking that I would save and have extra toothbrushes on hand when my toddler wore one out. When I received the toothbrushes, they were not the style pictured. They are longer handled and have a rounder head. The bristles are still about the same softness and I will use them, but I really wanted the one that is in the picture.</li>
    <li> These bristles were just as stiff as an adult toothbrush.  My son (17 months old) would cry when I brushed his teeth - especially if he was teething.  I switched to the [[ASIN:B003KJBGGU Radius Pure Baby Toothbrush, Ultra Soft]] and he loves brushing his teeth now.</li>
    <li> Right size for little mouths</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting because the ones I&#x27;ve bought in a store do not fall apart. I found that the bristles on these just kept coming out so I stopped purchasing these.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very practical for a samll kid, he can grasp it and use it successfully, and with a pack of 8, little kid can use it for a  long time</li>
    <li> They are the perfect size for a toddlers mouth! My son began brushing his teeth at 10 months. Yes, he had all of his teeth by then. This pack comes in all different colors. Must be changed every month or so.</li>
