<li> It looks like a black mascara when you first put it on, but when the sun hits it it looks blue or violet.</li>
<li> This is sort of dark Sky Blue.</li>
<li> its just mascara, there&#x27;s a slight blue tint to it.  </li>
<li> However, I&#x27;m not very fond of the applicator wand because it&#x27;s plastic</li>
<li> so I have to cover it with regular mascara making it kinda pointless.</li>
<li> Liked the color - it smelled kinda awful but no big deal....</li>
<li> use it every single day, and it goes with whatever colour clothing I&#x27;m wearing because its not a bright blue, but a sutle navy.  </li>
<li> blue is so hard to find.  </li>
<li> It is so hard to find mascara in blue</li>
<li> Navy blue mascara is hard to find.</li>
<li> truly a denim colour...looks subtle for a blue</li>
<li> That was a waste of a &amp;#34;gallon and a half&amp;#34</li>
<li> Does not appear harsh to the eyes and adds a little flare to the eyelashes!!  </li>
<li> so the color is definitely noticeable but not too crazy or out there.</li>
<li> so it does not look weird or anything.  </li>
<li> UNFORTUNATELY</li>
<li> You cannot go wrong in buying this mascara at all.</li>

    <li> GORGEOUS MASCARA. BEST I&#x27;VE EVER TRIED.</li>
    <li> Sooo In love with this Mascara will be ordering more in the future and highly Recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Good mascara and i love color. Also i love how it&#x27;s dark blue so the color is definitely noticeable but not too crazy or out there. However, I&#x27;m not very fond of the applicator wand because it&#x27;s plastic but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
    <li> It looks like a black mascara when you first put it on, but when the sun hits it it looks blue or violet. Very beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I love this! Denim color to go with your jeans? Whoever thought of it - thanks.  Better than other blue mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> THE COLOUR IS A POPPING BLUE ITS LOOKS BEAUTIFUL IN THE SUN LIGHT. IT EXTENDES THE LASHES. UNFORTUNATELY THE BRIGHT BLUE COLOUR DOES NOT LAST I HAVE TO TOUCH IT UP ONCE  OR TWICE A DAY. THE TWO STARS IS FOR THE COLOUR..</li>
    <li> Great mascara, especially when it&#x27;s quite hard to find a blue one at the store. Worth the money :)</li>
    <li> Love it,fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I like to lighten up my mascara with this blue shade for the summer.  It is really a nice tone of blue so it does not look weird or anything.  L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s mascaras are great quality so this one is no exception.  Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> light and surprisingly natural looking</li>
    <li> I wanted navy blue.  This is sort of dark Sky Blue. Uh. No. That was a waste of a &amp;#34;gallon and a half&amp;#34; worth of gas.</li>
    <li> I wish the color was darker. It&#x27;s pretty light so I have to cover it with regular mascara making it kinda pointless.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really find this to be up to Loreal&#x27;s normal standards.  It didn&#x27;t show its denim color well.  It clumped.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Does not appear harsh to the eyes and adds a little flare to the eyelashes!!  Wish you had more!!</li>
    <li> Navy blue mascara is hard to find. This was a fabulous purchase and it is honest to it&#x27;s promised performance . I hope to be able to repurchase when the time comes. Thank u loreal!</li>
    <li> its just mascara, there&#x27;s a slight blue tint to it.  Its a 3 star because it smells funky</li>
    <li> i love it, it gives you volume and lenght.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara!</li>
    <li> Perfect color that is not easily found anywhere.</li>

    <li> blue is so hard to find.  love the color and product</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara, it is a very nice color.  Indoors (or in dull light), it just looks like normal mascara, but when you go in the light, it is a pretty blue color that seems to bounce light off of it.  Very nice and like the other Loreal Voluminous, it is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t clump but just defines your eyelashes very definitely.  It is so hard to find mascara in blue but this is the perfect blue for me.  Not too light and not too dark.  You cannot go wrong in buying this mascara at all.</li>
    <li> I use this product and color to accent the tip of my eye lashes. I have blue eye, so it accentuates my eye color</li>
    <li> Always get tons of compliments on this mascara. The best blue mascara I have tried. I love the shade of blue it is.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  Love the blue which is hard to find!</li>
    <li> I love blue mascara and it is hard to find. This product is great and I would recommend to anyone who wears blue mascara to try it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Really need this item in waterproof formula as my eyes tend to water a bit which causes produçt to run and burn my eyes. My current solution is to apply a layer of same brand in w/p black on underside of top lashes and topside of bottom.</li>

    <li> First you see it then a while later you don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> It is a great product.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best mascara ever !!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every single day, and it goes with whatever colour clothing I&#x27;m wearing because its not a bright blue, but a sutle navy.  It washes off like a dream with my facial soap and water and then i just give it the final wipe off with eye wipes.</li>
