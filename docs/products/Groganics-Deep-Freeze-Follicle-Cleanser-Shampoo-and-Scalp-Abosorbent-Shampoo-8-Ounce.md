      <li>I am not sure if it really does anything, but it feels great on the scalp, and this was my second order from this purchaser for the shampoo</li>
      <li>i have seen growth from this product along with the conditioner, and head full of hair cream used regularly</li>
      <li>I discovered that they changed their main ingredient that combats DHT- and dietary supplements.  </li>
      <li>So far, I really like these products.</li>
      <li>Plus the shampoo was only 2/3 full in the bottle where as the conditioner was clear to the RIM (come on sellers</li>
      <li>I got a thyroid test and everything was normal.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;M ALSO USING THE OTHER PRODUCTS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS, I CAN WEAR MY OWN HAIR DOWN AND NOT SEE MY SCALP.</li>
      <li>But you live and learn.</li>
      <li>I had to visit a new stylist while mine was on maternity leave</li>
      <li>My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  </li>
      <li>Mine came clearly appearing tampered with !</li>
      <li>This well be my first time using the deep fried freeze follicle.</li>

      <li>the exact same company (American Linen) sold me the same &amp;#34;factory sealed shampoo&amp;#34; as they did the conditioner and both I am supposed to believe are filled by the manufacturer THAT differently and haven&#x27;t been tampered with????&lt;br</li>
      <li>My scalp feels so clear after that .</li>
      <li>But as far as results I haven&#x27;t seen any so far.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really this a proper rating because I don&#x27;t use this often.</li>
      <li>MY SCALP FEELS ALIVE.</li>
      <li>I am really in favor of the conditioner just purchased another bottle from my local BSS.</li>
      <li>So far no results.  </li>
      <li>Treat it early, and I hope you found this sooner than I did.  </li>
      <li>Shedding has come to a near halt.</li>
      <li>I had this natural, luxuriant hair that was to die for.  </li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, there is a strange but pleasant slight tingling / cooling sensation.</li>
      <li>Good thing my hair grows fast. :(</li>
      <li>My hair felt much more healthier and not as weak as it did prior to using this product.</li>
      <li>I bought a plastic bottle that has a top that looks like a cone and tapers down to a small opening</li>

    <li> I am loosing less hair with this product</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long but love the tingling feeling. I am really in favor of the conditioner just purchased another bottle from my local BSS.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really this a proper rating because I don&#x27;t use this often. I do feel the cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful, gives you this nice cool and calm feeling.  I Saw results in one week of use together with Grofganics Deep Freeze Scalp Stimulant Conditioner,  Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This well be my first time using the deep fried freeze follicle.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo that really leaves your hair and scalp feeling clean and fresh.  I use it daily as I would any other shampoo.  A little bit goes a long way especially if you have soft water.  I use about a dime size portion twice but I do keep my hair short for the monoxidil stuff-good product.    Rodney Field</li>
    <li> I had to visit a new stylist while mine was on maternity leave and she uses these products on her clients. I was having an issue with itchy scalp and bumps, but after only 3 weekly visits all bumps were gone and my scalp was invigorated and felt great. I&#x27;m back with my regular stylist and she now incorporates this product line in her business.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE WAY THIS MAKES MY HAIR FEEL AFTER THE SHAMPOOING. MY SCALP FEELS ALIVE. MY HAIR IS GROWING LIKE CRAZY. I&#x27;M ALSO USING THE OTHER PRODUCTS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS, I CAN WEAR MY OWN HAIR DOWN AND NOT SEE MY SCALP. BEFORE I HAD PATCHES AND WAS EMBARRASSED TO WEAR MY HAIR, SO, I GOT SEVERAL WIGS. MY HUSBAND HATED THE FACT I WAS WORRING ABOUT THIS BUT AS A FEMALE, IT&#x27;S A BIG DEAL.THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT. F.F.L.</li>
    <li> I have been using the entire Groganics hair system for about 3 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m amazed!  My hair definitely does not shed like it was; regular shedding &amp; not much at all!  My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  The \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; shampoos &amp; conditioner also works wonders &amp; leaves your hair SOFT!  Using the Groganics system on a daily basis produces the best results!  I wash &amp; deep condition my hair twice a week as some of the daily hair products are a bit oily, however they do show RESULTS!  I also use the vitamins, but I only take one a day as my hair does grow rapidly; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics!</li>
    <li> Like the shampoo , no new hair yet !</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans well and give the scalp an invigorating boost.  I like the clean stimulating effect this shampoo gives.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very effective. Not only does it feel fresh and clean, but it has helped in stopping my hair loss and it has even helped to re-start hair growth. My hair is thicker and my front hair line is more full. Now I am not saying that it&#x27;s like having a hair transplant, but it has helped after about four weeks. I also use other products too such as Rogaine and other hair loss products that I try. I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Just purchased. Not sure if it helps, but it smells good and it tingles when you use it.</li>
    <li> Shedding has come to a near halt. Is it the Groganics? After one month of use it&#x27;s hard to say because hair naturally sheds in cycles. I will say this is the finest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used and the scent is refreshing. Without question my hair appears and feels fuller, because it is. Hair has a permanent silky texture now that is quite extraordinary. For late summer, I noticed I had to hit the barber a week earlier than before....Now that&#x27;s weird. Application: I use it everyday. Upon entering the shower I immediately wet down my hair. Then, using a dry wash rag I dry off all the excess water so the hair isn&#x27;t soaking wet. I want the product to not be to diluted. Then I hit it with a dime sized amount of the shampoo and the product foams up like crazy with little pressure using a plastic scalp massager. I leave it on the scalp the entire time while in the shower until just before exiting. I shave in the shower so the product is on for a good period of time. Like other reviewers, there is a strange but pleasant slight tingling / cooling sensation. It&#x27;s quite remarkable and feels very nice. I rinse using cooler water, not hot water. I delicately towel dry, use 5% generic minoxidil, and style. So far I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with Groganics shampoo because I know something is happening. It seems it is indeed blocking DHT, the primary culprit to mens hair loss. If you&#x27;re considering purchasing, do it. I think ladies may receive the same benefit.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I am white with baby fine thinning blond hair. I bought 3 items: Groganics Deep Freeze Follicle Cleanser Shampoo, Groganics DHT Blocker System Growtherputic Intensive Scalp Therapy Conditioner, and Groganics DHT Grotivator Growth Moisturinzing Lotion. The shampoo works really well and leaves my hair clean and soft. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all. I like the smell and the feel of it as I wash my hair. It has a cooling effect on the scalp. I have not used it long enough to know if it is working to stop my thinning hair. I haven&#x27;t used the Groganics DHT Blocker System Growtherputic Intensive Scalp Therapy Conditioner yet, so I can’t comment on it. I do use and like the Groganics DHT Grotivator Growth Moisturinzing Lotion, but I use it at night just before I go to bed. It is much too heavy to use during the day because it’s too oily. The ingredients are: Water, Olive Oil, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Vitamin A (Retinol), Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol), Propylene Glycol, Cetereath 20, Steric Acid, Lanolin, DMDM Hydantion, Saw Palmetto (Serena Repens), Chamomile (Matrican) Extract, Oat (Avena Sativa) Extract, Fragrance (Parfum). I bought a plastic bottle that has a top that looks like a cone and tapers down to a small opening so I can put it precisely on the areas of my scalp that are thinning the most. (The type of bottle that they put hair color in at the salon.) Be aware, these products from Groganics do NOT have security seals underneath the caps. The seller assured me that all the Groganics come that way and not to worry…the products are fresh and are what they say they are. So far, I really like these products. I give them a 4 because they are lacking security seals.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Seems to work with reducing breakage - not sure it helps with growth</li>
    <li> Got it on time no results yet that I can see ,Got the Grogenics Scalp Stimulant not to crazy about this on over conditions my hair don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the first time following the Nutrine Garlic Conditioner and the Eqyss Rebuilder and the shedding stopped. I have been finger combing my hair for the whole day and have only seen 4 hair strands and before it used to be more than 20. I just hope this results lasts and helps me out regrowing all the lost hair i had.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product strengthens your hair, stops it from falling out and promotes new growth.&lt;br /&gt;You will see a difference from the first wash. Your hair feels cleaner, stronger, and softer. Your scalp will thank you when you done.</li>
    <li> The item worked ok.  Not really the desired results as I would have hoped for.  Pricing is ok but found a better product for the same price</li>
    <li> My scalp feels so clear after that . I totally like it.</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH COMMENTING ON</li>
    <li> So far no results.  I have been using it for about 1 month.  It may be that it just does not work for me, but it may be that it just does not work.  One suggestion is that they should consider putting vitamine D3 into the mix.  D3 has been shown to improve hair growth.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it really does anything, but it feels great on the scalp, and this was my second order from this purchaser for the shampoo so I give it thumbs up for something.  Problem-free transactions both times; and for any kind of shampoo, this is a good price from a reliable and fair merchant. Yay for good shopping, yay for good merchants, yay for good deals!</li>
    <li> This shampoo gets hair really clean . Ive only had it for a month or so but love the way it feels very cooling on my head , Will continue to use with vitamin supplements</li>
    <li> I like the tingly feeling it leaves on your scalp. But as far as results I haven&#x27;t seen any so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months.</li>
    <li> It actually helps with hair loss.  I&#x27;m 19, and my hair has been thinning evenly around my scalp.  I had this natural, luxuriant hair that was to die for.  I woke up with it looking like a supermodel.  For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been trying rosemary shampoo, Nioxin once -until I discovered that they changed their main ingredient that combats DHT- and dietary supplements.  I got a thyroid test and everything was normal.  I just kept thinning and thinning.  I have this short bob now that I got to resemble Isabeau from Ladyhawke, but I&#x27;m still sad I didn&#x27;t learn about DHT earlier, because I&#x27;ve never really had my hair this short before.  Here&#x27;s hoping it grows out faster!  I&#x27;ll continue to use Groganics until I&#x27;m quite sure the thinning has completely stopped, and I&#x27;ll save the bottles if it ever happens again.  DHT sucks!  Treat it early, and I hope you found this sooner than I did.  I use this with the shampoo, and to put my Nioxin to use, I apply that after-shower/everyday cream after bathing.</li>
    <li> I used this product after reading all the great reviews and it completely pulled all of my hair out. My hair was shoulder length and it fell out and like knotted up and stayed matted as if i had braids in it and nothing would get it out. I had to cut my hair so short that its not even long enough for a pony tail. i was ver hurt and up set. But you live and learn. Good thing my hair grows fast. :(</li>
    <li> It makes your scalp tingle and  feel very good on your head and i would buy it again. A Copney</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair, this is an absolute must try!  There is no guarantee that it will work for you, because as the saying goes, different folks different strokes, but for this brown woman with thinning hair, it&#x27;s a God send.</li>
    <li> I brought the same product for 3 different sellers. And the viscosity of the shampoo it&#x27;s very different, one it&#x27;s white like milk and one us clear.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m confused. Any suggestions</li>
    <li> This product really freeze your scalp leaving a great,cool sensation in your hair. However,I must say that my hair doesn&#x27;t get any smooth though it in fact,stop the hair from falling. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner I have bought hands down. There is an amazing tingling sensation that you get when you use this product along with the conditioner. I even felt my scalp tingling after I finished blow-drying my hair and several hours after that. If you compare this product to Dr. Miracle Gro&#x27;s tingling shampoo, groganics is much better as your scalp continues to tingle throughout the day. My hair felt much more healthier and not as weak as it did prior to using this product.</li>
    <li> I was quite pleased with this shampoo. It made my scalp feel clean and tingly immediatley after using it each time.</li>
    <li> I never got it  dont know why  i think it was dropped in the wrong apartment  and i ask and no one saw nothing  but the mailman did delived it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they wont replace it  one time as a courtesy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will buy to someone else&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY</li>
    <li> My hair follicles really do feel clean and &amp;#34;declogged&amp;#34; after using this product. Smell is pleasant and low key. I will continue to use this product as a compliment to other products in the line.</li>
    <li> After just one washing I can see a difference in my scalp.  I don&#x27;t know if my hair will grow in thicker as a result - especially since for women is difficult sometimes to really know the cause - but at least I can feel as though my scalp is no longer the problem.  Also, you need to be careful not to get into your eyes - it doesn&#x27;t burn - it is sort of like the sensation of noxzema on your skin - tingling and cooling at the same time.  But since the shampoo is thin, and your have to remove the cap to use - it can be difficult to control.  You should consider pouring the shampoo into a pump dispenser..</li>
    <li> Overpriced, you can get the stimulating by mixing some tea tree oil or peppermint oil in your shampoo. But hubby says he likes it. Still don&#x27;t plan to repurchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok..you feel the coolness, for awhile, let it sit 10-15min re-lather. Invent a carrier lotion which includes minoxidil, ok</li>
    <li> I bought this product after trying their everyday scalp cream. If you have problem with thinning because of (DHT) accummulation, then this is the product for you. It has definitely helped my hair grow back around the hairline where i had the most thinning...love these products!</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions, this product really does a great job at cleansing the scalp, and allowing hair follicles to re-emerge.  Take pictures, and you&#x27;ll see.  Expect notable improvements to be visible in ~ three months.  I do not use any other scalp products like Minoxodyl or Propecia.  I highly recommend this product !</li>
    <li> Great product and last a long time</li>
    <li> I would never ever buy this I tem again because it doesnt work at all.  you will find more reviews of me because I bought more than 5 bottles but salty this shampoo  never work.</li>
    <li> Soothes scalp better than anything tried.  Very much like this.  Will buy it as a regular item.  Ahh...after a few days I forgot my hair previously itched.  A godsend!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it make my hair feel clean.</li>
    <li> these do not come &amp;#34;factory sealed by any means!&amp;#34; No trust that way that the item you are getting hasn&#x27;t been tampered with or is what you are purchasing! Mine came clearly appearing tampered with ! They had &amp;#34;:home made&amp;#34; taped tops over the bottles just made of a triangle shaped &amp;#34;bubble wrap and tape&amp;#34;! You remove that and the lid is underneath and then it had plastic remnants on the bottle where it clearly had at one point a plastic factory seal that had been REMOVED!!! Plus the shampoo was only 2/3 full in the bottle where as the conditioner was clear to the RIM (come on sellers no factory fills any product to the upper lip at all ever)...&lt;br /&gt;and the exact same company (American Linen) sold me the same &amp;#34;factory sealed shampoo&amp;#34; as they did the conditioner and both I am supposed to believe are filled by the manufacturer THAT differently and haven&#x27;t been tampered with????&lt;br /&gt;Do they really think people are that stupid!!!?? BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Been using groganics for about 6 weeks and my hair is getting thicker. Be careful, it will burn your eyes.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased all 3 products the Hair Gro-n-wild DHT Blocker System, Deep Freeze Follicle Cleanser Shampoo and the Deep Freeze Scalp Stimulant Conditioner and I use on my hair 3 days a week. The best advice I can give anyone is to purchase all 3 and see for yourself how good these products work.</li>
    <li> this is also  a very good product.</li>
    <li> excellent product, my wife is the user and she loves it</li>
    <li> I don;t see much change yet..Very few new hair growths.</li>
    <li> Very good product it does what it is suppose to do and makes your scalp feel amazing. i have seen growth from this product along with the conditioner, and head full of hair cream used regularly</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it lives up to all the claims the company makes, but I do like it for basic cleaning of my hair.  It does make your scalp cool and that&#x27;s kind of relaxing for me.  I do plan on buying this shampoo again.  And it came quickly too.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
