### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But it was perfect for SEVEN YEARS!</li>
      <li>Preseve is an excellent company.</li>
      <li>Win.</li>
      <li>I think making products from recycled plastics is a great concept.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Great company with a conscience.  </li>
      <li>Everything is great except that you can&#x27;t select the color.</li>
      <li>I&amp;#34;m really happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, they are also of great quality.  </li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>They also make recyclable toothbrushes and have a good recycling</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
      <li>We would love to suggest using a hemp compound for your filter containers, we are eliminating plastics from the planet as they are toxic!</li>
      <li>I love mine and have had it for YEARS!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a cheap disposable razor in that fact but still works great.</li>
      <li>Would also be nice if it was disclosed on Amazon that the razor is made from yogurt cups.  </li>
      <li>I get a really nice shave with them.</li>
      <li>Nice close shave.</li>
      <li>These blades work great and are eco friendly.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get any more cuts than I did with the fancy popular</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this razor.</li>
      <li>They work better than I thought they would.</li>
      <li>Love that they are made of recycled materials.</li>
      <li>Handle is ok.</li>
      <li>I love that this razor is recycled and that you can recycle the handle.</li>
      <li>There is a chance that they will someday be able to implement a recycling program for the blades.  </li>
      <li>I am quite impressed, and it came pretty fast for ordering in the christmas season!</li>
      <li>This is better than a bic</li>
      <li>Based on my research they seem to be an OK company.  </li>
      <li>Love that the company uses recycled materials and doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  </li>
      <li>With plastics piling up in our landfills and killing our sea creatures, polluting our oceans, making use of plastic that is already on the planet is pivotal.  </li>
      <li>How many handles will you go through in your lifetime vs blades?  </li>
      <li>I love that it is made out of recycled plastic.</li>
      <li>, I decided to give a more eco-friendly option a go.  </li>
      <li>love that this is made of recycled plastic and not tested on animals</li>
      <li>And this blade head also doesn&#x27;t have that fancy, large moisture strip of the more popular razors but that didn&#x27;t matter either!</li>
      <li>So far though really good and does its job!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit flimsy, gets clogged easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin very smooth.</li>
      <li>I use Harry&#x27;s Razors at home with much better results and much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>what I liked about my trusty old gilette daisy was the slim, light handle (good for a travel kit) and the squared off edges.</li>
      <li>Blades fall off easily</li>
      <li>This razor is fine-</li>
      <li>Thank goodness the refills fit into another razor I have.  </li>
      <li>Cheap and gives me razor burn.</li>
      <li>and there would still never be a smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>The quality is great and the recycling efforts are something other companies should strive to be more like.</li>
      <li>Good razor, little cheap feeling.</li>
      <li>But as far as comfort and shave goes, this is not my favorite.</li>
      <li>For my skin, I need a fancier one with more cushy features, sadly.</li>
      <li>but, honestly, it&#x27;s in the same realm as a bic in terms of comfort.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>An added bonus to me is that they come in fun colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using regular razors and I was excited to try this one because I wanted to shift to more sustainable products.</li>
      <li>The razor went right into the recycling.  </li>
      <li>I chose them because they are environmental friendly, but they are very human friendly, too!</li>
      <li>So, if you are using MORE of these blades and they take (presumably) around the same amount of material to produce, well, you do the math.  </li>
      <li>My local health food store caries these and as much as I love my Gillette Mach 3</li>
      <li>I have used this razor for several years and it was just ok.</li>
      <li>I had the first one for more than ten years!</li>
      <li>and I prefer supporting a company making an effort to find solutions for recycling.</li>
      <li>The head doesn&#x27;t move so could be improved but willing to keep using based on company policies.</li>
      <li>The cost is relatively low compared to my aforementioned beloved standard.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the shave is close, the handle is ergonomic, the colors are fun, and the fact that it&#x27;s&#x27; environmentally friendly is a big plus.</li>
      <li>The blades themselves work just fine, when they actually STAY inside the razor itself.</li>
      <li>really easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought this because the replacements blades were a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>as soon as I&#x27;m done with the blades, this handle is going straight into the recycle bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Ethical and cruelty-free products are at the forefront of my shopping radar.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product because it&#x27;s recycled, made in the USA, and not animal tested, but I just do not like the quality of it.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, environmentally responsible, and affordable in the case of loss, these razors are my go-to.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight, but works well.</li>
      <li>and I really like them.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t shave the hair very well, either, and I cut myself.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m all about trying to be as environmentally friendly as possible</li>
      <li>My smooth legs last just as long with this razor than they did with the &#x27;special&#x27; 5 bladed Venus brand.</li>
      <li>Make sure not to leave the blade facing down in a damp area.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone who likes buying ecofriendly products.</li>
      <li>Other than that, they get the job done just fine.</li>
      <li>Even if they use 50% less resources to manufacture, Mach 3 would win in a shootout because they easily last 4X as long in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>the fact that this company tries to be environmentally friendly for a product one wouldn&#x27;t think needed to be &#x27;green&#x27;, is just one more reason to try this razor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been perfectly OK with a cheap razor, but I started to feel guilty about throwing away all that plastic.</li>
      <li>In addition, the Persona Tri-Flexxx blades are a much cheaper alternative that are an exact match, saving you money in the long run.</li>
      <li>I particularly love the lime green!</li>
      <li>I love this brand of razors, works well and stays sharp for a long time.  </li>
      <li>But if you ever have problems with shaving- sensitive skin, irritation, or whatever-</li>
      <li>It is, after all, made from recycled materials, so the fact that it sits lightly in the hand (as opposed to some clunky, heavy, non-recycled / non-recyclable handle) is reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with these razors.</li>
      <li>After a few shaves they are pretty much done.  </li>
      <li>Only real downside is that they aren&#x27;t very flexible, so you just need to be a bit careful when shaving around the curves of your face.</li>
      <li>The three blades work fine and last as long as any other blade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>This company seems to be pretty actively thinking about environmental impact.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It barely worked after 1 shave.</li>
      <li>All your hairs get caught in the blade effectively making it useless after 3 strokes.</li>
      <li>Although I love the idea behind this product in terms of eco friendliness, the blades suck.</li>
      <li>Also there is no #5 recycling center where I live so</li>
      <li>The only problem with this product is that in comes in a pretty heavy duty  plastic case which seems to counter the whole reducing waste and plastic concept.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ethical and cruelty-free products are at the forefront of my shopping radar. When I discovered that Gillette and others include animal by-products in their moisturizing strips I immediately began searching for a different razor. This is comparable to the Mach 3 - it provides a close shave (underarms, legs, bikini, etc.) and doesn&#x27;t have all of the bulky material trapping the hair in the blades. The razor stays sharp for weeks, the handle is extremely ergonomic, and it&#x27;s affordable...I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with these razors. They work better than I thought they would. Only real downside is that they aren&#x27;t very flexible, so you just need to be a bit careful when shaving around the curves of your face. Other than that, they get the job done just fine. Highly recommend to anyone who likes buying ecofriendly products.</li>
    <li> The handle is made of recycled plastic but you still throw away the blades... Is there some way to recycle the blades that I haven&#x27;t heard of? I have used this razor for several years and it was just ok. For some reason I was trying to pretend they work well. Initially the blade just felt dull but razors I&#x27;ve bought lately have plastic edges that stick out farther than the blades and I feel like I&#x27;m just scraping my face with plastic. I think I&#x27;ll just switch to the Gilette safety razor throwback that the Pawn Star guy has been selling on TV.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am trying to find alternatives to regular razors, which I think are wasteful. I think making products from recycled plastics is a great concept. The only problem with this product is that in comes in a pretty heavy duty  plastic case which seems to counter the whole reducing waste and plastic concept. Also there is no #5 recycling center where I live so that makes it a little more difficult to recycle it to.</li>
    <li> So the head of this razor only has 3 blades, which compared to the 5 bladed Venus brand seems wimpy. But I actually haven&#x27;t seen a difference! My smooth legs last just as long with this razor than they did with the &#x27;special&#x27; 5 bladed Venus brand. And this blade head also doesn&#x27;t have that fancy, large moisture strip of the more popular razors but that didn&#x27;t matter either! I didn&#x27;t get any more cuts than I did with the fancy popular razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the fact that this company tries to be environmentally friendly for a product one wouldn&#x27;t think needed to be &#x27;green&#x27;, is just one more reason to try this razor.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight, but works well. It seems designed to use the least amount of plastic possible, even the packaging, which is exactly what I wanted. And it&#x27;s 100% recycled plastic. Win.</li>
    <li> Cheap and gives me razor burn. I like that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and is recycled/recyclable. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> With plastics piling up in our landfills and killing our sea creatures, polluting our oceans, making use of plastic that is already on the planet is pivotal.  I love mine and have had it for YEARS!  No more disposable for me...whatta waste!</li>
    <li> Love that they are made of recycled materials. Not ideal for leg/body shaving.</li>
    <li> I love that this razor is recycled and that you can recycle the handle. I&#x27;ve been using regular razors and I was excited to try this one because I wanted to shift to more sustainable products. This razor is fine- it works. But if you ever have problems with shaving- sensitive skin, irritation, or whatever- this is probably not the razor for you. It&#x27;s a bit flimsy, gets clogged easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin very smooth. For my skin, I need a fancier one with more cushy features, sadly.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, environmentally responsible, and affordable in the case of loss, these razors are my go-to. In addition, the Persona Tri-Flexxx blades are a much cheaper alternative that are an exact match, saving you money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this razor. I love that it is made out of recycled plastic. However the blades falls off a lot while I am trying to shave. The blades get the job done but the blades are so close my leg hair gets caught in the blade. I hope they continue to redesign this product. I keep purchasing if improvement were made.</li>
    <li> This is great. It&#x27;s made from recycled materials. Nice close shave. My son has one complaint. The head does not pivot when shaving his face. It&#x27;s like a cheap disposable razor in that fact but still works great.</li>
    <li> Some of the reviews note that the handle is flimsy, but I rather appreciate the lightness of this product. It is, after all, made from recycled materials, so the fact that it sits lightly in the hand (as opposed to some clunky, heavy, non-recycled / non-recyclable handle) is reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice: Make sure not to leave the blade facing down in a damp area. I accidentally did so, and the next morning, the moisturizing strip was stuck to the surface and broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the shave is close, the handle is ergonomic, the colors are fun, and the fact that it&#x27;s&#x27; environmentally friendly is a big plus.</li>
    <li> The handle is a little flimsy; however, I can deal with that knowing how it is made! Does the job!</li>
    <li> These razors are not very good. They do not give a close shave at all, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought this because the replacements blades were a reasonable price.  Missed the flexibility and comfort of the newer more expensive razors.</li>
    <li> Good razor, little cheap feeling. So far though really good and does its job!</li>
    <li> I usually hate to write a bad review, but I felt compelled to write about how terrible this product is. The blade was the dullest thing I have ever used, and sad to say I bought this because I love the preserve Toothbrushes, and how they are all recyclable, but unfortunately all the recycling in the world cant compare to a bad product design. All your hairs get caught in the blade effectively making it useless after 3 strokes. It barely worked after 1 shave. Where my Gillette blades can last for weeks. Sorry guys, but you really need to step it up, or drop this product.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of razors, works well and stays sharp for a long time.  I&amp;#34;m really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Love that the company uses recycled materials and doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  The head doesn&#x27;t move so could be improved but willing to keep using based on company policies.</li>
    <li> Preseve is an excellent company. I have been buying from them for years. The quality is great and the recycling efforts are something other companies should strive to be more like.</li>
    <li> This razor gave me the worst razor burn I have ever had in my life, followed by inflammation and in-grown hairs. I do not know why it was so bad, but didn&#x27;t even attempt to use it twice. Unfortunate, as I really wanted a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; product. I have now tried several of the products from Preserve and found them all to be inferior.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about trying to be as environmentally friendly as possible but this razor is terrible. I am mad at myself for buying the refills without just trying one first. I feel like I could shave all day and there would still never be a smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these, but they were very hard to use. THe blades don&#x27;t rotate and move, so I had to hold the razor at a weird angle to shave. It didn&#x27;t shave the hair very well, either, and I cut myself.</li>
    <li> love that this is made of recycled plastic and not tested on animals</li>
    <li> These are some of the only vegan razors on the market.  Thankfully, they are also of great quality.  We will continue purchasing.</li>
    <li> I am not reviewing this product, I just did not know where else to ask this question.  Is this product an actual razor or just blade replacements?  I need the actual razor not replacement blades.  Not sure if anyone knows, but if so, please respond!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am getting tired of spending so much for Mach III razor cartridges.  This razor is so lightweight, it feels like a disposable razor after what I am used to. But, it is holding up well and I prefer supporting a company making an effort to find solutions for recycling.</li>
    <li> This is my second Preserve Triple Razor. I had the first one for more than ten years! After about seven years, the bits that hold the razor head lost a bit of their stiffness and the razor head fell off a lot--not while I was using it, but if I would drop it or something the head would pop off. But it was perfect for SEVEN YEARS! This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great company with a conscience.  I use their toothbrushes as well and will be buying containers.  These blades work great and are eco friendly.  We don&#x27;t need 5 blades with a vibrating handle like other manufactures have.  The three blades work fine and last as long as any other blade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Blades fall off easily</li>
    <li> I like the eco aspect and that they do not contain lanolin and not tested on animals. But as far as comfort and shave goes, this is not my favorite. I take this with me on trips because if it gets lost...whatever, nbd. I use Harry&#x27;s Razors at home with much better results and much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Everything is great except that you can&#x27;t select the color.</li>
    <li> It is well made, and blows my minds that it is made out of recycled yogurt cups! I received a blue one, and I think besides the green one, there is an orange one and a dark grey one.(I have seen them in grocery stores). I am quite impressed, and it came pretty fast for ordering in the christmas season!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product because it&#x27;s recycled, made in the USA, and not animal tested, but I just do not like the quality of it. The blades themselves work just fine, when they actually STAY inside the razor itself. I find them very difficult to install the refills, and they continually fall out while I&#x27;m using them, I think because they don&#x27;t pivot and move like I&#x27;m used to? I have to say that at LEAST every other time I shave my underarms, the blade falls off of the razor, and since I am unable to wear my reading glasses in the shower, it&#x27;s near impossible to get it reinstalled. Even outside the shower, I have a difficult time getting it seated properly. Maybe I just got a bum razor, as the other reviews seem to suggest otherwise, but I can base my opinion on my experience(s). I will not be reordering.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for some time now and I really like them. I chose them because they are environmental friendly, but they are very human friendly, too! I get a really nice shave with them. An added bonus to me is that they come in fun colors. I particularly love the lime green!</li>
    <li> Thank goodness the refills fit into another razor I have.  The razor went right into the recycling.  Would also be nice if it was disclosed on Amazon that the razor is made from yogurt cups.  I&#x27;m a vegan and I would have never purchased if it encouraged people to eat cruelly derived dairy products.  Not sure if soy or almond milk yogurt cups were used.</li>
    <li> We would love to suggest using a hemp compound for your filter containers, we are eliminating plastics from the planet as they are toxic!</li>
    <li> My local health food store caries these and as much as I love my Gillette Mach 3, I decided to give a more eco-friendly option a go.  As I see them, here are the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This company seems to be pretty actively thinking about environmental impact.&lt;br /&gt;- The cost is relatively low compared to my aforementioned beloved standard.&lt;br /&gt;- They also make recyclable toothbrushes and have a good recycling program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now the cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The recyclable part of this razor system is the handle.  How many handles will you go through in your lifetime vs blades?  A one-time hit on a non-recyclable handle is nothing compared to the blades.&lt;br /&gt;- The blades are not recyclable (I verified this on their website).&lt;br /&gt;- The blades don&#x27;t last very long.  After a few shaves they are pretty much done.  By contrast I have had Mach 3 blades last so long I refuse to tell you because it is embarrassing.  So, if you are using MORE of these blades and they take (presumably) around the same amount of material to produce, well, you do the math.  Even if they use 50% less resources to manufacture, Mach 3 would win in a shootout because they easily last 4X as long in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;- The comfort of shaving with these is nothing like shaving with, say, a Mach 3 or equivalent.  This is better than a bic but, honestly, it&#x27;s in the same realm as a bic in terms of comfort.&lt;br /&gt;- If you even have 5 days or so of hair growth you will have to take multiple passes and the blades get clogged up really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is: supporting Preserve by buying these razors isn&#x27;t a bad choice.  Based on my research they seem to be an OK company.  They are committed to eco-friendly products.  There is a chance that they will someday be able to implement a recycling program for the blades.  There is a chance that they will someday improve their effectiveness and comfort.  However, this razor system is a tough proposition at the moment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been perfectly OK with a cheap razor, but I started to feel guilty about throwing away all that plastic. what I liked about my trusty old gilette daisy was the slim, light handle (good for a travel kit) and the squared off edges. I tend to hold it with my fingertips. as for Preserve, I&#x27;m not impressed by the handle design, which is fat and rounded. at first it didn&#x27;t seem that hard to hold, but once my hands are all covered with soap in the shower, I feel like I have to grip this with my fist like a little kid grips a crayon. if I hold it with my fingertips, it totally feels like it&#x27;s going to spin around or slip out of my grasp and cut me.  as soon as I&#x27;m done with the blades, this handle is going straight into the recycle bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to find a reusable handle with a square shape! haven&#x27;t seen one yet. it&#x27;s too bad, I like supporting Preserve, since they are a certified B corporation.</li>
    <li> Although I love the idea behind this product in terms of eco friendliness, the blades suck. Handle is ok. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest getting this unless you are using it as sort of a backup or one time use razor. I&#x27;ll think go back to my Venus..</li>
