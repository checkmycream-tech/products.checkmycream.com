      <li>For drying out a pimple it works decently (but it is not the best thing I&#x27;ve tried)..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but it can be a good barrier or substitute for moisturizer on acne skin.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer with a fresh tingly minty feeling.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with Body Shop products, so I was excited to try this face lotion.  </li>
      <li>and he said it burned his face (he has more sensitive skin), so it is probably best for people with \\&quot;resistant\\&quot; skin.   </li>
      <li>This sure does do both.</li>
      <li>I love this product, but you also  have to love tea tree oil to love this product.</li>
      <li>I love tea tree oil products but for some reason this one didn&#x27;t work out well at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many face creams</li>

      <li>I love this lotion..</li>
      <li>I wake up and my face is so much more ...</li>
      <li>If I had an idea of how often to use it or something, it would have been better.</li>
      <li>Often I run out before I&#x27;m able to go to a body shop retail store, so it&#x27;s helpful to be able to buy this online.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m so glad I found this</li>
      <li>but it definitely doesn&#x27;t break me out which is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I love this skin care lotion</li>
      <li>This product does an outstanding job on oily skin.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, although some might not because it&#x27;s really strong.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is super amazing.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves a nice matte finish&lt;br /&gt;--</li>

      <li>Super light-weight but still moisturizing!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference with regard to skin clearing</li>
      <li>When you put the lotion on it is so light</li>
      <li>It is non sticky and light.</li>
      <li>This stuff hsa been great at reducing redness in areas with former blemishes.</li>
      <li>It feels light</li>
      <li>The texture of the lotion is nice, almost like a mix between lotion and gel, and it absorbs really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Which is awsome because I have always had the problem where things would be light weight but not moisuterize.</li>
      <li>Fantastic effect on pimples and whatnot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50+ with congested skin (go figure at this age) and this lotion is light and clean and does everything it claims.</li>
      <li>Definitely has made her more confident!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dried out my skin.. which in turn made me break out</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have stubborn skin that always has a few blemishes. I&#x27;ve tried many different face washes and lotions. This helped clear my skin up after only a few days. It feels clean on your skin, the tea tree smell is not overpowering, and it is not too drying. I also like the tea tree night lotion, but that drys up my skin more than this. I&#x27;ll keep using this lotion indefinitely!</li>
    <li> After a lot of research on oil-control moisturizers I ended up going with this one, and I am thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- It really does control oil for several hours&lt;br /&gt;-- Feels light and cool on the skin -- refreshing, really&lt;br /&gt;-- It absorbs quickly and leaves a nice matte finish&lt;br /&gt;-- Works very well under liquid foundation&lt;br /&gt;-- Has not caused any irritations, breakouts, or other assorted weirdness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin and are looking for something to help control oil and shine for several hours a day, then I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel nice and soft.  This lotion goes on matte which eliminates any shine on my face when I sweat.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever, been using this stuff for 5+ years. Keeps face moisturized, rids my face of acne (maybe I just stopped getting acne with age, not sure, but it stopped being an issue for me and I partially credit this product), smells great. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and isn&#x27;t sticky. Often I run out before I&#x27;m able to go to a body shop retail store, so it&#x27;s helpful to be able to buy this online.</li>
    <li> Love The Body Shops Tea Tree Collection!! I have been using it for years and my acne has really cleared up.</li>
    <li> this is good for daily use under make up.  It&#x27;s not too strong, but it can be a good barrier or substitute for moisturizer on acne skin.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day and i could really feel my skin to be little clear and soft then before, but i think thats it, it is not effective after that.&lt;br /&gt;Has a strong eucalyptus smell.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Lightweight, fast absorbing, refreshing tea tree scent. I&#x27;ve tried so many face creams so I appreciate coming across a good one. I tend to be on the oily side, which tends to lead to clogged pores and occasional acne, even in my 30s. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> First off, If you are sensitive to smells DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. I am not sensitive to them so I think I can get used to it, but it almost smells like Vics Vapo rub and earth. I have a really oily t zone and bought this hoping it would bring down the oil enough where my skin wouldn&#x27;t break out. I have only used it a couple of times and it seems to work when I don&#x27;t have a heavy foundation over the top of it. I usually apply this at night though, since that seems to be when I am more acne prone. Overall I guess it says what it does, it just doesn&#x27;t fulfill my search for &#x27;the mattifying&#x27; lotion that I need. Chances are I probably will repurchase, the price is fair enough!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff . I will be buying more. Great for all types of skin and blemishes</li>
    <li> This lotion does seem to help with my acne, but it also makes my skin very dry.  I put it on and an hour later I feel like I need to remoisturize.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!  Keeps oil at bay through most of the day.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I wasn&#x27;t so crazy about this product at first. It irritated my skin and my skin was still shiny after using it. However, I rated it a 5 star because I have super sensitive skin and like this option of a non-chemical and natural solution. It did take me a while to get used to it, but the stinging sensation did go away, my skin was no longer oily, and it cleared up my skin a lot. All I can say is to give it some time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree products, and was very pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon, since I have to make a 45 minute drive to the nearest TBS store. To sweeten the deal, Amazon Prime and Amazon Mom means that I get my tea tree products whenever I need them, for way cheaper than the company&#x27;s prices, without having to drive. &amp;#60;3 it! As far as why I prefer this particular  lotion- my skin goes haywire every time the weather changes, and I get clogged pores like nobody&#x27;s business. Putting this stuff on twice a day after cleansing makes a HUGE difference, and my skin tone has improved greatly.</li>
    <li> Not only does this reduce shine and help to prevent blemishes, but my skin feels all around better. I have mild rosacea, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. I just need a dab, and it leaves my skin feeling smoothed, soothed, and refreshed. I&#x27;m not using it in conjunction with other products in the line (I can see that over drying). This alone is great for me.</li>
    <li> Effective for controlling oil. Recommend</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that it would help clear up my skin.  I have been using ProActiv for years and wanted a change.  This didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff hsa been great at reducing redness in areas with former blemishes. I wake up and my face is so much more ... skin-colored! The tea tree oil is good at reducing break-outs, too.  The tea tree part is a little bit strong. I had a friend try it and he said it burned his face (he has more sensitive skin), so it is probably best for people with \\&quot;resistant\\&quot; skin.   But yeah, I highly recommend it for people with acne and hyperpigmentation related to inflammation (e.g. from leaky gut) to help out while you address the inflammation.</li>
    <li> It dried out my skin and caused me to break out badly.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful with keeping my son&#x27;s  face moisturized.</li>
    <li> I am 26 and got my first break out of adult acne. I have never had bad skin and if i ever broke out it was during that time of month and only lasted a couple of days. This was worst than ever and lasted for over a month and showed no signs of going away. I tried this product along with the facewash and within 2 wks my skin has cleared up dramatically. I am so pleased with this product!!!! my skin is clear and feels moisturized without being greasy</li>
    <li> This face lotion works amazing.  Makes my skin feel very soft!</li>
    <li> I have not used it regularly but whenever I have used it .. i feels burning sensation on my skin. Stop using and now and not sure how effective it is.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer with a fresh tingly minty feeling. The odor isn&#x27;t too strong nor does it upset my eyes. Definitely going to be continuing using this product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, although some might not because it&#x27;s really strong.  That&#x27;s about the only thing I love about it.  It&#x27;s not a terrible product and it might work really well for some people, but it doesn&#x27;t help my skin at all.  My skin gets dry and it seems to break out more when I use it.</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin very smooth and soft.  Pungent smell but vanishes in seconds. Does not hydrate and moisturize.</li>
    <li> I love this facial lotion, although there isn&#x27;t a lot in the small tube. You only need a pea sized drop for your entire face because a little goes a long way. I swear by this tea tree facial lotion! It makes your face baby soft, and it does clear up blemishes.</li>
    <li> I use this under foundation to help mattify my skin and keep it shine-free. The tea tree oil helps dry up any blemishes. It can be a little drying overall, so it might not be the best product for someone with sensitive or dry skin. I&#x27;d recommend this lotion for normal, normal-oily, oily or blemished skin types.</li>
    <li> Its Tea tree. Ofcourse its awesome. I started using this when i was a teenage year old boy. My parents bought me it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of tea tree oil for treating acne breakouts, but sometimes in its purest form, it can be a little overpowering in strength and smell. Since I&#x27;m allergic to benzoyl peroxide and am limiting my salicylic acid usage (for various health reasons... I still use a BHA toner but am trying to wean off of it), I began to seek out treatments that use tea tree oil and came across this one from The Body Shops Tea Tree line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty drying lotion, I do admit. Most of the negative reviews address that. I would not advise using this all over your face, because it is pretty strong, and can really dry your skin out. Even if you have oily or combination skin, this is not necessarily good for your skin&#x27;s health. Instead, use a pea-sized amount morning and night, applying it directly to pimples and breakouts, but ONLY there. Do not use it as a moisturizer or lotion as it is advertised, because it can burn or sting in addition to drying skin out, as I noticed even with my conservative usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an acne spot treatment, I think it does the job really well because it dries out pimples almost immediately, and it&#x27;s a lightweight, non-greasy or sticky formula. It as silicones to make it spread out very smoothly and evenly, which was a huge strength of this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a warning, this does contain Calophylum inophyllum seed oil which, according to Beautypedia is an ingredient that has been known to be cytotoxic (kills cells). I take Beautypedia&#x27;s advice to fit my personal preferences since it is written by a skin care brand, but if you are paranoid about these sorts of things, I&#x27;d stay away from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not irritate my usually sensitive and hyperallergenic skin (but, as I mentioned earlier, sometimes it does sting a little, like most acne treatments do)&lt;br /&gt;- Has a pleasant light tea tree fragrance (not a huge issue for me personally)&lt;br /&gt;- Tube is quite large in comparison to those tiny finger-sized tubes of normal acne spot treatments, so it will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;- Decently priced (~$14 at TBS; I got it for cheaper on Amazon)inger-sized tubes of normal acne spot treatments, so it will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;- Decently priced (~$14 at TBS; I got it for cheaper on Amazon)</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion! It is the first product I have bought from this product line! I really like how it makes my skin feel! It feels cool on your skin and has a really good smell to it that just wakes you up! It&#x27;s great to use if your going to the gym because it will help prevent breakouts! It&#x27;s not a heavy lotion and it doesn&#x27;t take much to hydrate your face!</li>
    <li> I have a very oily T-zone and by mid-day, my face is covered in oil. It&#x27;s as if I smeared my face in Crisco. That&#x27;s attractive. I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers and used up many oil blotting papers. I&#x27;m kind of stupid because I never thought of searching for a mattifying product. I looked around on Amazon and found this lotion. The reviews were great so I figured, why not? I&#x27;ll give it a try. Well, I&#x27;m so glad I found this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my face isn&#x27;t completely oil-free, it&#x27;s significantly reduced the oil on my face. Even by the end of the night, my face isn&#x27;t as greasy as before. I still blot here and there, but definitely not as often. I absolutely notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that it had SPF in it. It would&#x27;ve been perfect. Plus, the fragrance is quite strong. If you&#x27;ve never smelled tea tree oil before, it&#x27;s basically like you&#x27;re rubbing the juices of a tree on your face. Like a tree is right in your room and right in your face. The smell goes away, but the initial whiff is intense. The bottle is pretty small, too. That isn&#x27;t so bad though because you really only need a small amount, like smaller than a peanut M&amp;M amount. At least, that&#x27;s how much I need. Also, make sure you exfoliate or else it will show the flakes on your skin. I don&#x27;t even use a separate moisturizer after using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. I will definitely re-purchase when I run out. Here&#x27;s a random tip: instead of buying oil blotting papers, go to Starbucks and stealthily steal some napkins without buying coffee. The employees won&#x27;t notice because they&#x27;ll be too busy making someone&#x27;s latte with the person&#x27;s name spelled incorrectly on the cup. Their napkins are really good at absorbing oil. Works just as well as those small oil blotting papers. Or you could also go to a public restroom and steal some toilet seat covers. They&#x27;re also good for oil blotting. Hope my review has helped you!</li>
    <li> While I love the rest of the tea tree line by the Body Shop, this lotion seemed to make my acne worse instead of clearing it. I had to stop using it because my acne became out of control. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product, will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne all my life. I&#x27;ve been on pills and done other stuff too. I don&#x27;t know if this is only supposed to be a moisturizer, but I used it as pimple cream and it REALLY worked. It got my pimples on my chin away completely. Definitely will continue to use! So glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Although they have seemingly changed the moisturizer, it still works like the older version did. I still love this line!</li>
    <li> My neighbors always complained about my dissatisfying tea tree in the back yard. In return, I had bought 55 gallons of this wonder stuff.&lt;br /&gt;This is how you use it:&lt;br /&gt;Apply a 55-Gallon bucket of lotion to your tee tree and lather it in water.&lt;br /&gt;Then set it on fire and call the fire department, hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels good on the skin. It is non sticky and light.</li>
    <li> This kept my skin clear. Goes on nicely as a gel and smells minty. You only need to use a dime size; a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells great, moisturizes well, but made my face break out. Back to Cetaphil for me, unfortunately</li>
    <li> I AM TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH THE GREEN TEA PRODUCTS. I BREAK OUT ON OCCASION AND THIS HAS STOPPED ME FROM HAVING REOCCURING BREAKOUTS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS LINE</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything really. It is very thin and dries quickly. I have only used it once and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion..It really does help with breaking out. I love how it leaves my face feeling refreshed...not oily and lotioned up like other products..</li>
    <li> With someone with darker skin, it makes my skin look ashy and dry.  It does give me enough moisture, I just wish it didn&#x27;t leave that look on my skin.</li>
    <li> The smell is not very good.</li>
    <li> It has a very strong smell, but served the purpose for my teenage step-daughter&#x27;s acne issues.  Highly recommended for acne or oily skin.</li>
    <li> Very good lotion for oil / shine control, invigorating on the face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working for my acne prone skin.  Only this is I wish it came in a lager size.</li>
    <li> it moisturizes your face and clears up your skin and feels amazing on your skin, very refreshing and helps with bad skin</li>
    <li> This helps clear me up wonderfully, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough to be used alone. I layer this under a more substantial moisturizer so I don&#x27;t get dry patches.</li>
    <li> This product is very suitable for me， I enjoyed it very much ，The body shop is amazing to choose~cool~very good</li>
    <li> I use the Tea Tree face wash and was hoping to find a cheaper replacement for a price oil control hydrator I currently use (which works really well). I used this under my SPF 30 powder foundation and was greasy within about 35 minutes. It&#x27;s still a great moisturizer for oily and breakout prone skin, so I use this at night under my anti-aging treatment. I have noticed fewer breakouts and clearer skin, so I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I like The Body Shop line, how everything is organic and ethically made. This lotion is a pretty good product. I started using it yesterday, and it works wonders. This thing really does mattify, I had it on for a few hours, and I would continuously check if I had any oil (my skin is very oily, and how I check for oil on my face is that I take the back of my hand and lightly drag it across my face, then I hold it into the light, if it glistens, than there&#x27;s oil). Guess what? There was no glistening! No oil! I can&#x27;t really say if it has done anything with my acne (I&#x27;ve got breakouts) because I use it in conjunction with St. Ives Green Tea scrub and Simple Soothing facial toner (also good products) but one particular zit has gotten smaller since yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;Heads up for first time users, after I washed my face and applied my toner, I put this on and it has a warm, tingling feeling (feels like and Icy Hot patch). It&#x27;s not a burning sensation, but if you have sensitive skin, it might feel like that. Also, it&#x27;s not THAT moisturizing, my face wasn&#x27;t super dry and tight, but it wasn&#x27;t as hydrated as I wanted it to be, so this more like a treatment than lotion/moisturizer. I&#x27;m just gonna use this in conjunction with Olay&#x27;s complete all day UV moisturizer for combo/oily skin. Another heads up, this bottle is relatively small (about as big as a travel size deodorant stick).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It makes my face moist without making it itchy.  Good for people who don&#x27;t like to put stuff on their face, but find themselves in the occasional bout of cold, chapping weather.</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this!! I&#x27;m using it for the first time now and I love it. My breakouts are almost nonexistent! Feels fresh. Highly recommended it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this cleared up my daughters face.  In fact it might have made it less smooth.</li>
    <li> This product does an outstanding job on oily skin.  However, I have combination skin, so this product caused havoc on my dryer spots.  I still use the product, but only on my t-zone...and then I use a regular moisturizer everywhere else.  I am giving it 5 stars because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - mattify oil.  As an all-over moisturizer, I would only give it 3 stars.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it gives your face a gentle burning, tingly feeling after use. It feels so clean and the sensation subsides within a few minutes. I just used up the last of my bottle and I am placing an order for a refill now! The only downside is that the tubes are pretty small, but it still lasted me several months (non-daily use, maybe 3-4 times per week).</li>
    <li> Not a magic cure but it does seem to help reduce the acne.  It is a gentle treatment not causing the irritation that some acne products seem to cause.</li>
    <li> I bought the The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Care Kit One Size first and tried it out before I bought this, so I knew this product worked for me. The shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but you also  have to love tea tree oil to love this product. It&#x27;s clean and not greasy and sinks right into your skin. I&#x27;m 50+ with congested skin (go figure at this age) and this lotion is light and clean and does everything it claims. It&#x27;s not a product to get rid of your wrinkles or sagging but it does moisturize which makes everything look a little better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenaged brother, who is just starting to get really bad acne. When he uses this regularly with the lotion, it clears his skin right up.</li>
    <li> Used it for the same reasons as everyone else and it made it all way worse. Threw it away a week later. I love tea tree oil products but for some reason this one didn&#x27;t work out well at all.</li>
    <li> Very effective when it comes to impurities. I wish the product comes with a bigger size. it would be a &amp;#34;5 star&amp;#34; if they sell bigger size.</li>
    <li> Used for years, great product and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> The texture of the lotion is nice, almost like a mix between lotion and gel, and it absorbs really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it as my pre-makeup lotion after I found out I had perioral dermatitis and heard tea tree oil is helpful with that.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and hadn&#x27;t really thought much about it either way, until today.  The last two days my face has been extra greasy feeling, to the point where I just want to go into the bathroom at work and wash my face in the sink there (gross).  Then it dawned on me just now, I haven&#x27;t used the lotion the last two days out of sheer laziness.  So it seems that while I hadn&#x27;t been overly excited about this product before, it had been secretly keeping my face grease at bay.  And that, for a girl that lives in a very humid climate, is pretty crucial, and also pretty hard to find.</li>
    <li> After reading that tea tree oil has natural acne fighting principles, I tried this moisturizer and I like it a lot.  I have been using it for over a year now.  It is also good for people with oily skin as it is oil controlling.  The scent is light (of tea tree) as I don&#x27;t like heavily scented moiturizers.  Overall, this is a good &#x27;guy&#x27; product.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this a few days but, can already see a difference in my skin clearing up.  I have had problems with adult horomonal acne since I was taken off HRT.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Tea tree helps with acne, this moisturizer is great because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.  I normally hate moisturizers but this is one of the few I can stand.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super amazing. I have really oily skin, to the point that I will be blotting my face every hour and I gets really annoying. Nothing has helped until this and I have tried almost everything, face washes and creams alike. Nothing helped. This I use every morning, not at night, after my shower and I have a clean face. It is super light weight, once it is on you don&#x27;t even feel it bt my face is still moisterized. Which is awsome because I have always had the problem where things would be light weight but not moisuterize. This sure does do both. It helps control my shine for hours. I feel like I barely even have to blott my face anymore. I do my make up at 7:30ish in the morning and I&#x27;m not even thinking about blotting my face until 2pm then I might think about it and start to feel a tad oily. But I have asked my coworkers and she even said she notices less oil and even when i feel like it is oily she says it looks hyrdrated and glowy not oily. So I am so in love with this I am for sure going to keep it in stock and use all their other products. Which so far the black head exfoliating scrub is amazing too I reccomend this.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it At all. It  was not good for my face.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
    <li> Should have read how much of the product i would actually receive instead of looking at the picture. Makes skin burn when applied to dry skin.</li>
    <li> Every time I use the Body Shop Tea Tree Clearing Lotion I have an AWESOME facial experience.  When you put the lotion on it is so light and it is not heavy or greasy.  It simply moisturizes.  And it also clears up blemishes as they promise.  I use this product as part of tea tree facial regimen and I love this line!</li>
    <li> This lotion is really nice. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, and doesn&#x27;t make my any more greasy than it would normally be without the lotion...in fact, my face could be less greasy because of the lotion (although it&#x27;s really cold and dry here right now so that is drying out my skin and could also be the reason my face isn&#x27;t as oily as normal). The tea tree lotion leaves my face tingly and feeling refreshed every time I use it. I use it prior to applying my makeup and it soaks in to my skin quickly.</li>
    <li> Its hard to rate personal items but I will anyhow. I am 29 and have had some kind of acne for as long as I can remember. I have used a lot of products, some good some not so good. This smells pretty good, has a bit of a camphor smell (not exactly but difficult to pinpoint the actual smell). I only used it about 2 weeks, then returned it. The Body Shop was very good at authorizing the return, and refunded me as soon as the package was scanned out on my end. FAST!</li>
    <li> Goes on thin.. And keeps skin moist without being greedy or risk of acne</li>
    <li> absorbs quickly into my face, feels clean, not very moisterizing but I like this product a lot...delivery was ON TIME!</li>
    <li> I like it and I don&#x27;t like it. For drying out a pimple it works decently (but it is not the best thing I&#x27;ve tried).. my only problem is that I bought this as a &#x27;moisturizer&#x27;... I did not feel like I was moisturized at all, just dried out my sick. That being said I have dry skin, so maybe this would work on a oilier skin type.</li>
    <li> This product worked well for me right away.  I had small breakouts and somewhat oily skin. After the first use, I noticed improvements and breakouts have been completely controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with Body Shop products, so I was excited to try this face lotion.  It&#x27;s very effective at cutting down the shine and making my face less oily, which is awesome.  However, If I use if for more than one day in a row, it makes my skin extremely dry.</li>
    <li> This product is meant for oily skin, i wish i would have known that before I bought this. The scent is strong ! It breaks me out and dries out my skin.</li>
    <li> The only moisturizer that works to keep my skin clear.  I love this.  I sometimes have to use a little bit of another moisturizer in addition so it does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Super light-weight but still moisturizing! I don&#x27;t mind the menthol smell, as it&#x27;s only noticeable for the first couple minutes after you put it on and it makes my skin feel tight and refreshed. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference with regard to skin clearing but it definitely doesn&#x27;t break me out which is wonderful. Overall, a solid face lotion I reach for every morning and night!</li>
    <li> I love this skin care lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This skin care lotion also help me figure out the dry out problem in winter</li>
    <li> Great body shop tea..good for the skin..</li>
    <li> There were no instructions with this one.  If I had an idea of how often to use it or something, it would have been better.</li>
    <li> I liked this tea tree lotion, it did help with my acne a bit. I did notice however that it made my skin a bit powdery and appearance of dryness where I had applied it.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again despite the appearance as it did help clear up my skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smell, but not everyone would (i.e. my significant other did not like the smell at all). To each their own.</li>
    <li> When I decided to buy this it was because I was so embarrassed to go the store and traipse down the dreaded &amp;#34;Acne Aisle.&amp;#34; So I came here to amazon to see if I could purchase cleansers and lotions. Turns out you could. I didn&#x27;t want to get what I had been using because obviously it wasn&#x27;t working, so I bought this with fingers crossed. SO HAPPY I did. At first it was a little drying considering the cleanser I was using but after a month It was amazing. It didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; it but I saw a 90% reduction in... well you know the &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; word. I have no intention of trying anything else and I would recommend this highly. Fast shipping and so on.</li>
    <li> great product and great price!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic effect on pimples and whatnot. I was diagnosed with rosacea but I have my face completely clean, so where&#x27;s the rosacea? Great product.</li>
    <li> This lotion is incredible! My skin feels amazing and the lotion smell fantastic. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a combination of dry and oily skin like me. It smooths everything out and makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and have tried many kinds of oil control products. This is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny face. It feels light and I don&#x27;t mind the tea tree oil smell. After putting makeup and powder on over it, I still have to blot my face a few times a day, but this seems to work better than many other oil control moisturizers. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to break my face out. Overall, I like it and have re-bought it, which is a rare thing for me!</li>
    <li> My daughter has never been able to use a moisturizer without a strong increase in skin blemishes. She has problem acne that does not respond to OTC treatments or prescription creams (We&#x27;ve tried them all). On a whim I bought her The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil sample pack and noticed an immediate difference in her skin. After three months of consistent use of the three core product her skin is 80% clear. We are going to add the face mask next and see if we can get the other 20% under control. She uses this moisturizer after the toner to soothe the effect of multiple tea tree oil products. Definitely has made her more confident!</li>
