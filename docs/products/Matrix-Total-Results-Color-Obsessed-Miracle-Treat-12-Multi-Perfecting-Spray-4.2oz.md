      <li>It detangles my hair perfectly and makes my hair feel super soft.</li>
      <li>I have tried every spray leave-in conditioner out there and this one&#x27;s pretty good.</li>

      <li>My hair was so soft after that, so I purchased it and am VERY glad!  </li>
      <li>it would be worth it!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for dry hair.</li>
      <li>Once I apply this to my hair after towel drying, my comb goes right through and gets all of my tangles out and leaves my hair silky and keeps its curl!  </li>
      <li>It worked amazingly for my five years old daughter.</li>
      <li>I, too, want to stockpile this product because I love it so much.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that is very tangled after shampooing, even with using conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It smells great and it hydrates and calms my hair down!</li>
      <li>Conditions great without leaving hair feeling heavy.  </li>
      <li>I apply it every night on my freshly washed hair.</li>
      <li>After a lot of bleaching, it is the right leave-in product to use.</li>
      <li>Smells good and does not weigh hair down.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair is now and how easy it was for her to style it.  </li>
      <li>Hair feels soft and product seems to give my fine hair some texture.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use much of it, so don&#x27;t think I coat my hair in it!  </li>
      <li>Gives you soft, smooth, silky hair.  </li>
      <li>The first couple of bottles I bought clogged up because the spray was too thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this stuff and it works well enough.</li>
      <li>The product is good but the pump broke after a few uses.</li>
      <li>This stuff does the trick without weighing it down, I love it!  </li>
      <li>In fact, I bought it at the salon, used it for several days and loved it so much that I ordered several more bottles online for future use!  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft glossy and full of volume.</li>
      <li>I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;it very highly</li>
      <li>This really didn&#x27;t do much, I couldn&#x27;t really tell it was in my hair.</li>
      <li>This product just gets spritzed on before combing out your hair and really helps with the after-shampoo comb out.  </li>
      <li>I keep ordering this product, works very well for me.</li>
      <li>And the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>I much prefer a leave-conditioner and this one is great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this stuff gunks up my hair because ever since I&#x27;ve been using it my hair is harder to brush and tangles up easily.  </li>
      <li>Great product - not too expensive.</li>
      <li>serves many purposes without leaving a heavy film.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There must be a new formulation because it is not longer clogging up through the sprayer.</li>
      <li>I cannot live without it.</li>
      <li>I have color treated hair and have a really hard time finding good leave in conditioners that actually make my hair feel soft and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>Everyone that saw me the next day at work complimented me on how pretty and shiny my hair looked.  </li>
      <li>This product makes my hair so manageable, soft and shines.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my niece, who is a professional beautician.</li>
      <li>It just keeps your hair from feeling like \\&quot;straw\\&quot;, using this has made my hair so soft &amp; manageable.  </li>
      <li>I use this as a conditioner/detangler for my three year old as well.</li>
      <li>I am also not very talented with hair care and if something isn&#x27;t easy to use, I skip it.  </li>
      <li>This is honestly the only product that has ever worked for my thick, curly and coarse hair.</li>
      <li>Only negative is that the lotion that doesn&#x27;t get used at the bottom isn&#x27;t easily transferred to a new bottle.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft but not flat.</li>
      <li>It barely detangles.</li>
      <li>It was wrapped kind of weird, but got to me in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>It definitely feels moisturizing on my freshly washed still-damp hair but it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls.</li>
      <li>My stylist sprayed this product on my hair, and I was shocked at how easy she was able to comb thru my tangled wet hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best. Conditions keeps the frizz down too. Is not too heavy so won&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff and it works well enough.</li>
    <li> I just got back from the salon.  My stylist sprayed this product on my hair, and I was shocked at how easy she was able to comb thru my tangled wet hair.  I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair is now and how easy it was for her to style it.  I will NOT be without this product considering the amount of time it cut off on getting my hair combed alone it would be worth it!</li>
    <li> Thisis amazing.  I l o ve it and so does my hair!</li>
    <li> Better than it used to be. The first couple of bottles I bought clogged up because the spray was too thick.&lt;br /&gt;There must be a new formulation because it is not longer clogging up through the sprayer.</li>
    <li> The product is good but the pump broke after a few uses.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair so manageable, soft and shines.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this hair product.</li>
    <li> I like it because you don&#x27;t have to put conditioner in your hair in the shower .</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this but Matrix seems to fail in the leave-in department. I tried their Moisture one as well and it also was a big flop. This one does nothing for my hair. It barely detangles.</li>
    <li> I adore this product! It smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling, and makes my hair look fabulous. It was wrapped kind of weird, but got to me in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my beautician.  This is a wonderful product  and it helps keep the color for quite a while.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I think this stuff gunks up my hair because ever since I&#x27;ve been using it my hair is harder to brush and tangles up easily.  I don&#x27;t use much of it, so don&#x27;t think I coat my hair in it!  It is hard to wash out in the shower too.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel any softer and it still gets flying away.  Matrix used to make a GREAT  leave-in conditioner when they had the Logics line, which they decided to cancel for some reason!!  That was why I decided to give this a try.  Disappointing to say the least.</li>
    <li> This has totally transformed my hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Gives you soft, smooth, silky hair.  I use this as a conditioner/detangler for my three year old as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I have color treated hair and have a really hard time finding good leave in conditioners that actually make my hair feel soft and bouncy.  This stuff does the trick without weighing it down, I love it!  No more straw hair for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent helps color stay longer and softer. Smells good and does not weigh hair down. Will buy again. Thank You</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product! It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I much prefer a leave-conditioner and this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;It serves many purposes without leaving a heavy film. I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;it very highly</li>
    <li> This Matrix product makes damaged hair smooth! After a lot of bleaching, it is the right leave-in product to use.</li>
    <li> I, too, want to stockpile this product because I love it so much.  In fact, I bought it at the salon, used it for several days and loved it so much that I ordered several more bottles online for future use!  I have hair that tends to be dry and have some frizz--especially if not blown dry.  I can put this on my hair wet, dry it for very short while and then let it air dry and it looks like I&#x27;ve used the flat iron!  That has never been an option for my hair type!!  It smells great and it hydrates and calms my hair down! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I had used a small bottle of it that came with the shampoo and conditioner package.  That didn&#x27;t last long so I was happy to find it on Amazon!  I have fine hair that is very tangled after shampooing, even with using conditioner.  I am also not very talented with hair care and if something isn&#x27;t easy to use, I skip it.  This product just gets spritzed on before combing out your hair and really helps with the after-shampoo comb out.  It also seems to help control my hair so that it doesn&#x27;t look so flyaway.  It is a great product!</li>
    <li> Great product my hair has improved and I&#x27;m buying more. I&#x27;m tough on my hair with coloring, blow drying and curling with curling iron. I can see visible results!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for dry hair. I apply it every night on my freshly washed hair. This and the Revlon no snap are the best I have found for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the only product that has ever worked for my thick, curly and coarse hair. The moment I apply it to my hair I feel the difference. It detangles my hair perfectly and makes my hair feel super soft. I cannot live without it.</li>
    <li> Like the other review, I had hair stylist put this in my towel-dried hair.  My hair was so soft after that, so I purchased it and am VERY glad!  It just keeps your hair from feeling like \\&quot;straw\\&quot;, using this has made my hair so soft &amp; manageable.  I just spritz some into palm of my hand (as stylist suggested) and apply to towel-dried hair.  Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have tried every spray leave-in conditioner out there and this one&#x27;s pretty good. It definitely feels moisturizing on my freshly washed still-damp hair but it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls. And the price is reasonable. I can&#x27;t speak to how color-protective it is but it&#x27;s a good spray leave-in.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products from a wide range of companies. This is the best product for short hair.</li>
    <li> I keep ordering this product, works very well for me. hopefully they do not discontinue item . smells very good also</li>
    <li> Love this product! Helps condition my curly highlighted hair</li>
    <li> This protects my long blonde color treated hair from the blow dryer and flat iron. Great price here as I was buying this at the salon. This is a great leave in. I pump it into my palm then rub my palms together and apply it from my ends the up to my roots. Then I comb it through then blow dry. Leaves hair soft but not flat.</li>
    <li> Helped with taggles love the smell</li>
    <li> I have blonde highlights so my hair is on the dry/damaged side. This really didn&#x27;t do much, I couldn&#x27;t really tell it was in my hair. Matrix does make another leave in treatment that I love though... Matrix Instacure Leave-in Treatment!</li>
    <li> The product was Recommended by a friend. It worked amazingly for my five years old daughter. No more hair pulling or &amp;#34;it hurts mommy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great product - not too expensive. I love the smell. I&#x27;m not sure it does everything it says, but I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got my haircut a few days ago and my stylist used this conditioner on my hair.  I went in looking like I had straw for hair, and came out looking like a hair commercial.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve finally found a product that works on my long and hideously frizzy dry heat styled and color treated hair!  Everyone that saw me the next day at work complimented me on how pretty and shiny my hair looked.  I immediately called my stylist and asked for the name of the product she used.  I will be buying this product by the truckloads from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly a miracle!  I think I&#x27;m going to start stockpiling because I can&#x27;t imagine my hair without it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never looked better.  Only negative is that the lotion that doesn&#x27;t get used at the bottom isn&#x27;t easily transferred to a new bottle.  That&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;m eventually going to saw off the top and transfer the unused liquid gold into another bottle.  Yes, it&#x27;s that good!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair soft glossy and full of volume.</li>
    <li> Everything went as planned. They did what they said they were going to do.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.Love it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my niece, who is a professional beautician. Glad I took her advice!</li>
    <li> The only product that ever worked on my long curly hair.  Everyone knows with curly hair, comes dryness.  Once I apply this to my hair after towel drying, my comb goes right through and gets all of my tangles out and leaves my hair silky and keeps its curl!  This does NOT weigh my hair down at all!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have blond color treated hair, and can never get a comb through after it is washed and towel dried. This product gets ALL of my tangles out, I love it, and it smells so good. Trust me, get this leave in amazing conditioner!</li>
    <li> Conditions great without leaving hair feeling heavy.  Hair feels soft and product seems to give my fine hair some texture.</li>
</ol>
