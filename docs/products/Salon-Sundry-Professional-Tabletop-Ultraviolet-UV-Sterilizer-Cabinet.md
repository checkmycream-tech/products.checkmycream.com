      <li>gets the job done and looks nice als...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very easy to use works</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen sterilizers cost way more and this one is way better than all of them!</li>
      <li>Find a better unit and pay more!</li>
      <li>I have had mine for nearly a year and it works great!</li>
      <li>It weighs a good bit and you could easily fit a loaf of bread inside (hmm...</li>
      <li>easy of use many it the No.# 1 choice, when you have to train people on a lot of stuff its nice to have one that just has one button.</li>
      <li>I purchased two of this items for my wife spa in Colombia and since the very first time they work perfect, it is almost two years now and works like brand new ones, my wife take good care of it and clean them as per suggested by manufacturer and have no problems at all.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Make sure the bulb is installed correctly or it won&#x27;t start.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m sure glad</li>
      <li>sure to look way up inside and remove plastic protection from top  interior sides separate from lower plastic protection on sides before turning on otherwise</li>
      <li>so i wanted to make sure i got what i needed.</li>
      <li>I love this unit..</li>
      <li>With some effort I now have a functional and safe sterilizer.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Since I purchased this item without the benefit of any prior reviews, I&#x27;ll do my best to make it easier for everyone</li>
      <li>Just got mine today, and it is fantastic!</li>
      <li>sure many people will use this to sterilize towels.</li>
      <li>A well-ventilated area is suggested and depending on what you&#x27;re sterilizing, you might want to air-out the items for an hour or more.</li>
      <li>Glad I purchased this product.</li>
      <li>has cover  to protect uv light from escaping!</li>
      <li>Thanks for such a wonderful product, and loved the price.</li>
      <li>but after researching, this is much safer and effective because of the reflective top bottom and sides witch are nicely polished, (meaning you do not have to turn over produce to get both sides).</li>
      <li>The students at The L.A.B (Lexington Academy of Barbering) thought this was very cool.</li>
      <li>Works great and no issues so far.</li>
      <li>Arrived early and has been working great</li>
      <li>good quality and much cheaper than through barber supply houses.</li>
      <li>so i need to make sure my steel tips and tattoo machines are clean at all times.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a problem in use, but when opening the chamber it&#x27;s fairly easy to detect with your nose.</li>
      <li>Use in a ventilated area, as the smell of ozone can be strong.</li>
      <li>the directions could have been translated better, but all in all, so far, so good</li>
      <li>Arrived very fast.. really sturdy and great product.</li>
      <li>Tried both light bulbs and checked fuse to no avail.  </li>
      <li>Although I cannot really tell whether this machine actually sterilize effectively unless I look at the stuff closely with a microscope, I believe it works great.</li>
      <li>so far so good the staff is still using this equipment.  </li>
      <li>comes with an extra bulb AND 2 fuses, very handy.</li>
      <li>For the money you pay, the product you get is worth it!</li>
      <li>The user guide could be better but the sterilizer is not really complicated to handle anyway.</li>
      <li>This keeps all of my tools clean after I disinfect them.</li>
      <li>Remember, you have to clean your tools before placing them in sanitizer.</li>
      <li>The size is good for my usage, but I do wish it had a double tray or a shelf.</li>
      <li>so I through it out, thereby losing the full purchase price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
      <li>and you need a backup quick.  </li>
      <li>Came quickly and works like a charm.</li>
      <li>(luckily they sent a spare with the unit).</li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly and is as described</li>
      <li>Bulb burns out quickly, socket for the starter breaks.</li>
      <li>The first one  worked great for about a year and a half and then started  getting to the point where the UV light wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
      <li>Great little UV unit for the value.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a great little unit for the price.  </li>
      <li>After much fiddling around with everything I could access, cabinet did light up.  </li>
      <li>I love the product so far for me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m starting out on my own.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing is this unit does NOT include supplementary regular &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; - it is just an elaborate light bulb socket.</li>
      <li>it does emit a very very strong smell when you open the door.</li>
      <li>This machine is compact, work great when you just need a small unit .</li>
      <li>The safety feature works - if you open the door with the light on the light goes out.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was very fast, ordered on the 6th and got it on the 8th (amazon prime)</li>
      <li>I just needed a UV sterilizer in white for a table top.</li>
      <li>aware, the UV-C lamp creates ozone.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it comes with extra bulb and fuses..</li>
      <li>The only thing that would make this better is if there was a timer function that would automatically shut it off.</li>
      <li>I have sterilized my iPhone (of course, it was turned off while being sterilized), car key (smart key with battery), and watch many times, and they work just fine after sterilization.</li>
      <li>has a nice glow when lights are dimmed down yet</li>
      <li>very good but not sure what i&#x27;m supposed to do with the blue plastic on the inside.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not really big enough,you have to turn the brushes and combs.</li>
    <li> It worked for 5 minutes. I then read other reviews to check the bulb (luckily they sent a spare with the unit). I plugged the spare in and it lasted about 30 min. I already had threw out the box and didn&#x27;t have a way to ship it back so I through it out, thereby losing the full purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is this unit does NOT include supplementary regular &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; - it is just an elaborate light bulb socket.</li>
    <li> This is great quality, I was impressed when I opened the box.</li>
    <li> Glad it came with an extra bulb and two fuses, one blew in less than two months!</li>
    <li> This is the second on of these I&#x27;ve had to purchase. The first one  worked great for about a year and a half and then started  getting to the point where the UV light wouldn&#x27;t come on. I changed bulbs but I guess there was a short somewhere. The one I have currently I&#x27;ve had for about 6 months and so far no problems. For the price it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Arrived as promised</li>
    <li> Just received this specific sterilizer.  After plugging in....it does not work.  Will be sending back immediately.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast.. really sturdy and great product. Love the fact that it comes with extra bulb and fuses..</li>
    <li> I have had mine for nearly a year and it works great! We use it for my tools, tooth brushes, etc. It comes with a spare bulb, but I haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet. Its pretty powerful and creates a lot of ozone that you can smell when you open it up. The only thing that would make this better is if there was a timer function that would automatically shut it off.</li>
    <li> I have two of them and they are WONDERFUL! You can not go wrong getting one of them. Only thing I wish it had was a timer.</li>
    <li> Nice little machine. Keeps up with small items.</li>
    <li> This keeps all of my tools clean after I disinfect them. Lots of space. Remember, you have to clean your tools before placing them in sanitizer. This machine DOES NOT CLEAN YOUR TOOLS, it keeps them clean after you disinfect them.</li>
    <li> Yes, we are happy with this purchase.  The cabinet is rather generic, but seems to be built very well and comes with extra fuses and an extra bulb - very helpful when the original burns out and you need a backup quick.  One CON is that the unit could use some type of timer - so that you can set sterilization.</li>
    <li> This machine is compact, work great when you just need a small unit . Although it&#x27;s not heavy duty medical grade machine but it get the job done for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this sterilizer for personal use like sterilizing my toothbrush, wallet, glasses, and etc. because I like to sterilize my stuff for sanitation. Although I cannot really tell whether this machine actually sterilize effectively unless I look at the stuff closely with a microscope, I believe it works great. The sterilizer functions as the description. You need some vents when using this because of some gas-like smell coming out. Some people say it&#x27;s the ozone smell or something.&lt;br /&gt;Based on my personal experience, you can also safely sterilize some small electronic appliances with this sterilizer. I have sterilized my iPhone (of course, it was turned off while being sterilized), car key (smart key with battery), and watch many times, and they work just fine after sterilization.</li>
    <li> Machine create  bad odor, Need fix</li>
    <li> They are great! I&#x27;m starting out on my own. I just needed a UV sterilizer in white for a table top. They were delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Did the job for us. At this price level, this is one of the best sterilizers around. I use it for cleaning tools that will go on our fingernails or pedis. Never EVER trust the tools used in Nail Salons as most of them do not clean or sterilize them enough. BUY YOUR OWN and TAKE YOUR OWN</li>
    <li> LOVE it!.. I love this unit.. it is the same one we have at our school... would like for it to have a timer though!!</li>
    <li> For the most part I&#x27;m happy with this sterlizer cabinet.  I&#x27;ve used it for 6 months without issue.  The safety feature works - if you open the door with the light on the light goes out.  The size is good for my usage, but I do wish it had a double tray or a shelf.</li>
    <li> very good but not sure what i&#x27;m supposed to do with the blue plastic on the inside. parts were coming off so i took off the part that was loose. not sure if i&#x27;m supposed to take off the rest. it doesnt say anything in the instructions so i guess its supposed to stay. it does emit a very very strong smell when you open the door. i would suggest to keep it in a large area. my esthetic room is small, so i really smell it</li>
    <li> Mine came in a spotless box but somehow did not turn on ,needless to say I am very unhappy and returning it would cost me more then the machine itself Plus it&#x27;s much smaller then it seems not happy at all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for what I need, but I just wish there was an automatic shut-off once the items have been in there for the required amount of time.</li>
    <li> Met  my needs 100 percent.  The bulb was defective when I received the unit so I called the company and they sent a replacement within days.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> so far so good the staff is still using this equipment.  No complaints</li>
    <li> It is a nice size, great looking, good performance machine.</li>
    <li> Out of the box this would not work.  Tried both light bulbs and checked fuse to no avail.  I noticed the starter was quite loose in its socket, so I tried prying the contacts to make a tighter fit.  After much fiddling around with everything I could access, cabinet did light up.  We are using it delicately hoping it will continue to work.  Also produces an unpleasant odor, which we haven&#x27;t been able to figure out?  Tried gently cleaning the interior.</li>
    <li> This is a quality sterilizer and a good value. I like that it turns off if opened during the cycle.</li>
    <li> its perfect! gets the job done and looks nice als... has a nice glow when lights are dimmed down yet has cover  to protect uv light from escaping!</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this item without the benefit of any prior reviews, I&#x27;ll do my best to make it easier for everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research on UV sterilizer cabinets, I found that most are Asian manufactured and often rebranded (no problem), and many are not very well built (problem). The latter is not the case here. This sterilizer is quite sturdy, with a heavy duty power cord and power switch. It weighs a good bit and you could easily fit a loaf of bread inside (hmm... there&#x27;s an idea), yet it is still fairly portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite what the picture may suggest, it is not possible the operate the unit with the shielded glass door open. There is a fail-safe lever that depresses when the door is shut. The blue you see in the photo is protective shipping film. However, the inside looks exactly the same when powered on: cool blue. There is a quarter-sized hole in the shielding to allow inspection during sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason I purchased this unit is that it ships with an extra UV bulb. It also arrived with two extra fuses. A nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, the UV-C lamp creates ozone. It&#x27;s not a problem in use, but when opening the chamber it&#x27;s fairly easy to detect with your nose. A well-ventilated area is suggested and depending on what you&#x27;re sterilizing, you might want to air-out the items for an hour or more. The ozone seems to hang around metal objects for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure many people will use this to sterilize towels. I&#x27;m using it to sterilize small tools and parts before/after ultrasonic cleaning. It works well and comes with a removable metal basket to place these items within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not eligible for prime and seems like it would cost a lot to ship. The price I paid with free shipping from Mix Wholesale was a great deal and everything went smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no complaints. Lucked out on this one; it&#x27;s a great unit.</li>
    <li> Simple solution for rapid curing of photopolymer plastic resin. Comes with an extra tube.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to be working when we set it up - was almost going to return it but then saw that another reviewer had issues too.  If you fiddle about with the bulb position enough, it will probably work. Just sanitized the first batch of things and they have that familiar weird smell so I guess it&#x27;s working.  I wish it had a timer but it&#x27;s a great little unit for the price.  Will follow up after a year or so if it either stays good or craps out.</li>
    <li> Just got mine today, and it is fantastic! I&#x27;ve seen sterilizers cost way more and this one is way better than all of them! It only turns on when the door is closed, and it comes with an extra bulb! U can&#x27;t beat that anywhere! And, it came earlier than expected. ..definitely will order from this vendor again</li>
    <li> good product for the price</li>
    <li> works very well to sterilize my tattoo equipment I will def use these guys again I love the product so far for me it has worked well</li>
    <li> I needed this sanitizer to pass state board inspection. It is a good value for the money. It was in perfect working order when it arrived and I have no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> Easy to operate, works well, for the price - a great deal. Small but certainly holds personal items and tajes inky 20 minutes to sanitize.</li>
    <li> Just as promised. I was pleased with this product. Works great and no issues so far. Glad I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> For all intents and purposes, this is the best deal for the best product i could find. I spent hours on here searching and reading, i&#x27;m not made of money so i wanted to make sure i got what i needed. Delivery was very fast, ordered on the 6th and got it on the 8th (amazon prime) Works great, read some of the reviews and the one about a dirty sock caught my attention but it works! comes with an extra bulb AND 2 fuses, very handy. Use in a ventilated area, as the smell of ozone can be strong. I&#x27;m a tattoo artist so i need to make sure my steel tips and tattoo machines are clean at all times. i&#x27;m very glad i bought this product and i assure you, buy with confidence! Please don&#x27;t forget, every once in a while someone at fedex or UPS drops things so when i read bad reviews about broken or non working products... don&#x27;t forget things happen. For the money you pay, the product you get is worth it!</li>
    <li> this product is well built, and it works great, i use it for sterilizing produce that i dehydrate from my garden. i use an organic vegetable wash, then dehydrate, then in the uv cabinet for 15 minutes, then to the mason jars. i just bought it so i have not had any thing stored for long periods or tested for molds and fungus, but uv is now being used in hospitals for sterilization of rooms for all pathogens including flesh eating bacteria, so uv must  work. i might even use this before i dehydrate, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like the little peep hole to look inside.  the metal tray is heavy duty and works well. i learned to leave the switch on and just use the switch on the door to open and close between reloading. if you turn the switch to on and bulb does not come on, open and close the door slightly to activate the door switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be sure to look way up inside and remove plastic protection from top  interior sides separate from lower plastic protection on sides before turning on otherwise it will start smoking the plastic wrap like mine did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;originally i was just going to buy a bulb and put produce under it but after researching, this is much safer and effective because of the reflective top bottom and sides witch are nicely polished, (meaning you do not have to turn over produce to get both sides). i&#x27;m sure glad i did not try sterilization with unprotected bulb.</li>
    <li> Great little UV unit for the value.</li>
    <li> The product is flimsy but it does the job. It was delivered quickly and is as described</li>
    <li> Product came when expected and works well for sanitizing</li>
    <li> Would not buy! After 90 days it quit working and seller was not willing to help in anyway. Sad thing when you don&#x27;t stand behind your product!</li>
    <li> the directions could have been translated better, but all in all, so far, so good</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  - gets the job done. With some effort I now have a functional and safe sterilizer.&lt;br /&gt;  - cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;  - the seal on the inside of the door was bent out of shape on the unit I received. I bent it back with a wrench.&lt;br /&gt;  - the bulb that was in it wouldn&#x27;t turn on after two uses&lt;br /&gt;  - the bulbs it comes produce a toxic and smelly gas called ozone. Ozone is a very toxic gas and there is no reason to use an ozone producing bulb in this situation. I purchased a non-ozone producing bulb here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00859XRIK/&lt;br /&gt;  - Horribly translated &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s okay since you don&#x27;t really need them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your health, I highly recommend purchasing a non-ozone producing bulb to replace the ones this comes with.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I needed for a terrific price.i have price this in multiple places and the closest price to amazon.com was $20 more.</li>
    <li> I bought this Sterilizer for my cosmetic gadgets like Dermarollers etc. It does it&#x27;s job just as it needs to. Came quickly and works like a charm. I use it in my laundry room (while NOT doing laundry, so the room is not humid) and run the fan to get rid of any ozone emission. The user guide could be better but the sterilizer is not really complicated to handle anyway. Even comes with an extra lightbulb. Make sure the bulb is installed correctly or it won&#x27;t start. All in all recommended.</li>
    <li> CAME ON TIME AND DOSE A GREAT JOB.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Bulb burns out quickly, socket for the starter breaks. This unit will not last! I&#x27;ve purchased two. They are both very fragile and do not last. Find a better unit and pay more!</li>
    <li> Loved this product! The students at The L.A.B (Lexington Academy of Barbering) thought this was very cool. Thanks for such a wonderful product, and loved the price. I&#x27;m looking forward to shopping with you guys in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myron B. Moore</li>
    <li> This production no work you guys have to do something!</li>
    <li> came quickly,  was all i expected it to be. zero assembly.  good quality and much cheaper than through barber supply houses.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice and good working unit it&#x27;s very easy to use works well the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the o&#x27;zone but after a few times of using it you get use to it  I use it for sterilizing my tattoo equipment . (not the needles never reuse needles).</li>
    <li> Great quality !&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> easy of use many it the No.# 1 choice, when you have to train people on a lot of stuff its nice to have one that just has one button.</li>
    <li> It, doesn´t work, don´t buy it!!. I replaced all the fusse and try everithing in my hands and was a waste of time and money!!</li>
    <li> The shipping was so fast and it is a awesome sterilizer! Thank you</li>
    <li> Arrived in purfect condition A+ on that fits in my tattooing office beautifully A++ I am going to recommend my other tattoo employees get one</li>
    <li> Arrived early and has been working great</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Unfortunately, I purchased the item I don&#x27;t needed. I actually would like to purchase a towel warmer with UV sterilize ability. If it is possible, I would like to exchange for the right item. Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased two of this items for my wife spa in Colombia and since the very first time they work perfect, it is almost two years now and works like brand new ones, my wife take good care of it and clean them as per suggested by manufacturer and have no problems at all. when I made the purchase they arrived as offered by seller, then on one of my trips from Us to Colombia i put it for export. 5 days later we have them on site. great purchase, great item.</li>
    <li> Looks just as the photo.  Seems well made.  Like the removable basket for tools.  My only wish is I would like an automatic off switch when cycle is complete.</li>
