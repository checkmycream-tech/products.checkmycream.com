    <li> I love these brush and the prize &amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> Very well made blending brush. Excellent quality and very affordable. Comparable to Mac 224 and sigma e40 but cheaper. I recommend bdellium to a friend and continue to purchase them</li>
    <li> I like it! It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to! Nothing special! It&#x27;s worth the money! Don&#x27;t buy a cheap E.L.F brush! This one is well made and will last for a long time!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, and would easily compare them to the quality and performance of MAC, for less than half the price! I have the 785 and 776, fantastic brushes for blending!!!</li>
    <li> Why spend more than 15 dollars for a tapered blending brush by MAC or Sigma when you can get this brush for half the cost? They charge so much for brushes just because of the name. Well... This brush is amazing. I was able to blend out the shadow to almost non existent. The handle is long enough to where you can lightly feather out the shadow. I&#x27;m just more than impressed.

    <li> In my opinion you can never have enough blending brushes and the Bdellium tapered blending brush is one of my favorites.  It has nice soft bristles and doesn&#x27;t shed. This specific brush is use as my clean blending brush to blend all the hard lines out of my eyeshadow looks. It makes blending a breeze,  witch can sometimes be a tedious job depending on the look your going for. I have yet to be disappointed with any of my Bdellium brushes.</li>
    <li> I like it for what it is, a REALLY fluffy blending brush, but it sheds on me like crazy! I&#x27;ve washed it now at least 10 times (about every 3 weeks) since I first bought it back in January and it still sheds! I like the shape and what it does blending-wise, but then I have to go in and pick up the bristles it leaves behind. I bought it as a sigma e40 dupe/more affordable option, I should have spent the extra money and gotten the sigma one.</li>
    <li> love this brush. its fluffy and blends beautifully.</li>
    <li> Thicker then I expected, but I really like it. I have a ton of crease brushes but this ones different. I blends well and isn&#x27;t scratchy. It did not shed either.  I have other Bdellium brushes and this one did not disappoint. I have no complaints. Although if you don&#x27;t have as much space on your eye as I do, you might want a smaller blending brush for focused blending.</li>
    <li> Like this blending brush a lot.  Soft bristles and makes my makeup application well blended.  Easy to clean (I mainly use water and soap).  Recommend this anytime!</li>
    <li> This is actually a very good brush and I&#x27;m always harsh on my reviews. lol.  I&#x27;ve had this for a year and a half and havent bought another blending brush.</li>
    <li> Better than I ever expected.!! Blends like magic, I had to purchase more than one because of the quality. Go to brush for creative and flawless looks</li>
    <li> scratchy and shadding a lot. The shape is uneven, So can&#x27;t brend smoothly. not good at all.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it is so soft on the lid and does a great blending job. Will order a few more of these.</li>
    <li> I like this brush. It does a good job, but it does feel scratchy on my eyes so I am giving it four stars instead of five</li>
