      <li>It was great!</li>
      <li>This eventually leads to the midnotes which I get the scent of gardenia and the mimosa adding for a delicious tropical smell.</li>
      <li>It was a gift and this perfume smells so awesome.</li>
      <li>Awesome delivery time!</li>
      <li>this is ideal.</li>
      <li>My mom loved it!</li>
      <li>The bottle is also beautiful.</li>
      <li>I think if you&#x27;re looking for a perfume that works great with shorts and flip flops-  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>It smells so good</li>
      <li>Deseo one of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s most beautiful fragrances.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite!</li>

      <li>Thanx! :)</li>
      <li>One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that flowery smell that so many women&#x27;s perfumes do.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PERFUME</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
      <li>scent is very unique from others.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong at first and fades nicely</li>
      <li>First I think the appearance is great, the bottle is unique and really pretty.</li>
      <li>MAN can easily pass wearing this fragrance because of the woody character but if you are a man that does not feel comfortable wearing a tropical scent like this, you can always try Deseo for men.&lt;br /&gt;Box:6/10&lt;br /&gt;Bottle:10/10&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance:9/10</li>
      <li>I am an outdoorsy, country kind of girl, and I&#x27;ve never been much for flowery perfumes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect to use everyday since it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough about how great this fragrance is.</li>
      <li>Authentic quality fragrance and fast shipping !</li>
      <li>Its light and fresh-</li>
      <li>so I was lucky to find it here.</li>
      <li>hits all the right notes for me and wears well throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Pretty scent but not for me.</li>
      <li>The colors remind me of the beach with the blue symbolizing the water and the yellow the bright and sunny sky.&lt;br</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
      <li>The top opened woth a sharp fesh bamboo, bergamot, and the yuzu.</li>
      <li>Deseo is a very exotic,clean, green, and fresh fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The box for this is very simple but luxurious with the gold.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle, in my opinion, is one of the most people out there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean, crisp, a little woodsy...</li>
      <li>The original one i use to spray just 2 sprays and the smell was all over the place for few hours!</li>

<li> Eventually when the fragrance begins to die down, we are left with the amber, sandalwood, and small trace of pachouli.&lt;br</li>
<li> IT LAST ALL DAY, SOME PERFUMES FADE OR SMELL STALE AFTER AWHILE, NOT</li>
<li> Hard to find this perfume from 2008.</li>
<li> but not floral (I hate floral perfume).</li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>

    <li> Authentic quality fragrance and fast shipping ! Will order again soon</li>
    <li> Too heady/musky for me. Pretty scent but not for me. It&#x27;s strong at first and fades nicely but it didn&#x27;t mesh with me. I gave to a friend who loves it!</li>
    <li> Smell like over power kerasine</li>
    <li> First I think the appearance is great, the bottle is unique and really pretty. I have made  Deseo my summer scent. Its light and fresh- but not floral (I hate floral perfume). I think if you&#x27;re looking for a perfume that works great with shorts and flip flops-  this is ideal.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and this perfume smells so awesome.</li>
    <li> apparently this is hard to find so I was lucky to find it here. don&#x27;t really like the smell but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> everything came in on time but the perfume smells different than what i remember.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this perfume for the last 3 years or so when I smelled this on someone else and had to know what the fragrance was. It smells so good and I recognize it on anyone. It doesn&#x27;t have that flowery smell that so many women&#x27;s perfumes do. I think it has patchouli oil in it which makes the difference. I just can&#x27;t say enough about how great this fragrance is. I cannot wear it without someone commenting on it men and women love it.</li>
    <li> I am an outdoorsy, country kind of girl, and I&#x27;ve never been much for flowery perfumes. This is my favorite! It&#x27;s clean, crisp, a little woodsy...hits all the right notes for me and wears well throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Awesome delivery time!</li>
    <li> Deseo one of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s most beautiful fragrances. Deseo is a very exotic,clean, green, and fresh fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The box for this is very simple but luxurious with the gold.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle, in my opinion, is one of the most people out there. It is supposed to look like a diamond in the rough, I suppose. The colors remind me of the beach with the blue symbolizing the water and the yellow the bright and sunny sky.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very unique from others. The top opened woth a sharp fesh bamboo, bergamot, and the yuzu. This eventually leads to the midnotes which I get the scent of gardenia and the mimosa adding for a delicious tropical smell. Eventually when the fragrance begins to die down, we are left with the amber, sandalwood, and small trace of pachouli.&lt;br /&gt;*fun fact-the initial spray is very reminiscent of Katy Perry purr because of the bamboo.&lt;br /&gt;Sillage: avarage&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 7 hours&lt;br /&gt;A MAN can easily pass wearing this fragrance because of the woody character but if you are a man that does not feel comfortable wearing a tropical scent like this, you can always try Deseo for men.&lt;br /&gt;Box:6/10&lt;br /&gt;Bottle:10/10&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance:9/10</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME, I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS ON IT! IT LAST ALL DAY, SOME PERFUMES FADE OR SMELL STALE AFTER AWHILE, NOT THIS ONE. I HAVE OTHER PERFUMES BUT I JUST KEEP COMING BACK TO JLO&#x27;S.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. I can wear it day or night and get compliments while I&#x27;m wearing it all the time.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s perfect to use everyday since it&#x27;s not overpowering. The bottle is also beautiful.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes. Great price. Hard to find this perfume from 2008.</li>
    <li> Definitely it is fake (not the original)! i spray 8 sprays and the smell doesn&#x27;t even stay for an hour! It is more ADT not ADP. Very disappointed but it is what you pay for! The original one i use to spray just 2 sprays and the smell was all over the place for few hours!</li>
    <li> It was great! My mom loved it! Thanx! :)</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mother in law for Christmas. I think this along with the lotion was her favorite gift! Also received some free samples with order! Thank you! Will order from this company again!</li>
