      <li>Great</li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>Great hold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s holds your hair great</li>
      <li>Smells good.</li>
      <li>really good hold.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I do feel it&#x27;s a good product, and probably someone with an even shorter cut than mine would find it easier to use.  </li>
      <li>looks nice.</li>
      <li>a nice scent though.</li>
      <li>Im really picky about my hair products, but this one is great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very strong.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best putty I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Since I was on the clock, I didn&#x27;t have time to search for a suitable solvent.</li>
      <li>strong hold with a nice smell.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than comparable Axe/Old Spice/American Crew products and there is more product in it as well</li>
      <li>Since they have discontinued the pureology product, I have been looking for something that works like it or better.</li>
      <li>Even better then the texture twist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>sure where I go from here.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>, this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Napalm might have been better.</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricier on Amazon than I would prefer, so your best bet is to check out your local Wal-Mart or Grocery store.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has an understated almost fruity scent that is more refreshing than it is overpowering.</li>
      <li>Very similar to crew&#x27;s fiber except a lot cheaper, plus it smells great!</li>
      <li>Great product for the high hold in hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s 9 bucks for pretty darn good product.</li>
      <li>On the one hand, it is reasonably priced (especially with coupons and store sales) has a nice scent, easy to spread on your hands/fingers for application and has awesome hold.  </li>
      <li>I can run my hands through my hair and re-style it easily.  </li>
      <li>There is always a trade-off between strong hold and ease of washing</li>
      <li>It is a strong wax</li>
      <li>The biggest complainers are people who have never purchased strong wax.  </li>
      <li>Washed my hair 5 times and ran a fine tooth comb through my hair each time and could not get this product out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First impression was fine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>This seemed to fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>When it dries, it makes the texture of your hair feel like a cheap wig.  </li>
      <li>She confirmed my suspicion.  </li>
      <li>The hold and smell are fantastic.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s very quick to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; for lack of a better term and therefore, you best get the style right the first time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s horrendous to clean out, I contemplated shaving my head after 15 washes (3 days of 5 shampooing) it came out.</li>
      <li>Would never recommend to anyone who likes clean hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you&#x27;re not in love with your current product, or you&#x27;ve just gone short and haven&#x27;t found that perfect styling paste.</li>
      <li>Stylists LOVE working with it because it&#x27;s both very forgiving and can be styled almost any way.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First morning I used this, I worked a modest amount into my hands to warm it up and then applied it to my head.</li>
      <li>--IT&#x27;s 4 full ounces for $6!!!&lt;br /&gt;EXTREMELY</li>
      <li>Best product for men with super thick hair.</li>
      <li>It sells pretty fast in my experience, so better grab them while you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, price wins in the end.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
      <li>Then sculpt and twist pieces into the right texture and shape.</li>
      <li>Right??  </li>
      <li>If you use too much, you might find your hair doesn&#x27;t look as clean as you&#x27;d like it too.  </li>
      <li>I took a rather large amount of baking soda (medium hand full?)</li>
      <li>Incredibly good for one and a half to two inch hair.</li>
      <li>but as with ANY strong waxes, it takes a couple shampoos to completely wash out.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different hair products.  </li>
      <li>Be aware this leaves the hair matte-</li>
      <li>Is that when you shampoo your hair it does not come out the first</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want the shiny or crisp look, and I don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune getting my hair to look like I just got out of bed</li>
      <li>The first is that sometimes the putty will lose some of its hold at around 2-3pm, or 8 hours after I put it on.</li>
      <li>Smells good but not strong.</li>
      <li>A couple were a total bust, but the hyper fix putty did a good enough job that I started to use it on a more regular</li>
      <li>Tip the pieces with a little more product for durability, and finish with a light dusting of hair spray.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s wise to start with a little and learn how much you need.  </li>
      <li>far as smell, this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>It does a good enough job that I don&#x27;t feel as though I need so switch back to products four times the cost of this putty.</li>
      <li>/&gt;IF you are reading this after having purchased and used the product and you are searching for a way to clean your hair, the only success I&#x27;ve had in doing so is using baking soda and shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Works great when you put it on wet hair or dry.</li>
      <li>Holds stubborn hair in position very well.</li>
      <li>it does hold the style really well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I have to get ready for my day</li>
      <li>Very matte.&lt;br</li>
      <li>What you&#x27;re buying is really nice-smelling glue.</li>
      <li>It does indicate &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish and it really is.</li>
      <li>It was only after another two or three days of vigorous shampooing in the morning that my hair was finally free of the gunk.  </li>
      <li>J. Schultz really has it nailed with his review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other reviewers go into greater detail</li>
      <li>and I like to add texture, definition and sometimes some spiking or &amp;#34;bed head.&amp;#34; I have tried so many products designed for this, partly because I am a hair product junkie (I had a different word over junkie but was pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t appropriate for a review) and partly because I have been trying for a couple years to find a product to replace the uber expensive salon only sculpting paste/wax/putty I adore.  </li>
      <li>make sure to use very little at a time since its such a strong product.</li>
      <li>First, use a hair dryer (and maybe flat iron) to get your hair going in the right directions.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product at Walmart for about four dollars.&lt;br /&gt;The main problem I have with this</li>
      <li>Decent smell</li>
      <li>The key is, a little goes a long way, which is good because it&#x27;s already cheap and you won&#x27;t have to buy a new tub for awhile.</li>
      <li>Then, it took me about four tries to get the amount right, about a flat dime size at the most.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this putty.</li>
      <li>A complete waste of TIME (tons of time) and money (luckily it was cheap)</li>
      <li>Love the matte look because shiny hair always looks a little greasy on</li>
      <li>After washing, your hair is not sticky, but more of a heavy feeling of wax without the tack.</li>
      <li>Was looking for something that held better than mousse but not as heavy as gel.  </li>
      <li>I have used several options and have yet to find one worth complaining about.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I began by putting the normal amount of shampoo in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Was so happy to finally find a texturing paste that actually held my style, I went back to the store and bought 2 more in case it became hard to find in the future!</li>
      <li>There is very little time once you have it in your hair to style it before you&#x27;d have to add more or wash your hair to start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is terrible! It is very truthful advertising though, I will give it that! This product has indeed held it&#x27;s 24 hour promise even after 6 attempts to wash it out. I have to get ready for my day but tonight I will be hitting the baking soda to get this mess out! Would never recommend to anyone who likes clean hair.</li>
    <li> Awful. Leaves my naturally curly hair feeling dull and drab. Looks that way too. My hair feels icky to the touch and the build-up is terrible. It takes multiple washings during one shower to get it out of my hair. Only a clarifying shampoo works and I can only use that once a week.  Don&#x27;t buy. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I recently started wearing my hair a little on the longer side. (think Bruno Mars)  Was looking for something that held better than mousse but not as heavy as gel.  This seemed to fit the bill.  -Until I actually tried it.  It&#x27;s literally like putting glue or silicone caulking in your hair.  When it dries, it makes the texture of your hair feel like a cheap wig.  -No exaggeration.  But that&#x27;s not the worst part!  The worst part is when you try to wash it out.  I washed my hair 4 times in a row -two times with a plain bar of soap, &amp; still couldn&#x27;t get all this crap out of my hair!  Needless to say the whole container went right into the trash.  Why would anyone make a product like this?  Why would anyone want a product like this??</li>
    <li> WILL NOT WASH OUT. I&#x27;ve used tons of different products for my short spiky hairstyle and this is the absolute worst I&#x27;ve ever used. It will NOT WASH OUT. It took a week, washing twice sometimes three times a day with the strongest &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoos before gunk residue was removed.  Insane that this is still on the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s holds your hair great you just can&#x27;t wash it out. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product for the high hold in hair.</li>
    <li> It holds and is workable.  However, like others have stated, you cannot get it out of your hair with basic shampoo.  After washing, your hair is not sticky, but more of a heavy feeling of wax without the tack.</li>
    <li> I have a short pixie cut, with thick, wavy hair, and two ridiculous cow licks. I&#x27;ve used American Crew Fiber and Garnia Frutice in the past and this was my first time with L&#x27;oreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as smell, this is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s fruity, but not as strong as Garnia and no where near the odd smell of Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I put way too much in and my hair looked dirty, greasy, and was super weighed down. Then, it took me about four tries to get the amount right, about a flat dime size at the most. Really strong hold, which I need for the stupid cow lick I have right front and center of my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why some reviews say it doesn&#x27;t wash out. With short hair, a little bit of product, and regular shampoo (I use Tressame) the putty should come out in thirty seconds of scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the products I&#x27;ve tried, this is my favorite. The key is, a little goes a long way, which is good because it&#x27;s already cheap and you won&#x27;t have to buy a new tub for awhile.</li>
    <li> Great product IF you wear your hair in a very short, textured style, a la short pixie cuts, like I do.  This is NOT a product for use on medium or longer styles.  Be aware this leaves the hair matte-if you are looking for a soft and shiny result for your  &#x27;do, this isn&#x27;t the stuff for you.  Contrary to those complaining that it doesn&#x27;t wash out, I&#x27;ve personally had absolutely no problems, and I use this product every day.  I use cheap ol&#x27; Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo every morning, and I have not experienced any difficulty or build up.  Was so happy to finally find a texturing paste that actually held my style, I went back to the store and bought 2 more in case it became hard to find in the future!</li>
    <li> I wear my hair several different ways, from the slicked-back but volumed pompadour look to a spiky forward-do. My only prerequisites for hair products are that they hold well, and that they&#x27;re low shine. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Txt It 02 (stupid name, by the way) sort of does the first and definitely does the latter, but it&#x27;s the price that is making this a four star and not a three star or lower review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair. Stylists LOVE working with it because it&#x27;s both very forgiving and can be styled almost any way. The downside, of course, is that I need hair products that perform well - medium hold products are a joke to my hair and even some strong hold products fail to keep things in place. Before switching to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s hyper fix putty, I was using both Aveda&#x27;s grooming clay ($27 or something crazy like that) and American Crew&#x27;s product which is up there as well. The unfortunate mixture of needing more product for thicker hair AND more expensive products finally got the better of me, so I decided to try a few different products from my local grocery store. A couple were a total bust, but the hyper fix putty did a good enough job that I started to use it on a more regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a couple of complaints. The first is that sometimes the putty will lose some of its hold at around 2-3pm, or 8 hours after I put it on. Not a huge deal (I use it in conjunction with hairspray now and that seems to work just fine) but it&#x27;s worth mentioning. The other is that this will not work very well at all if my hair is even slightly damp, which is a change from the other products I&#x27;m used to that do pretty well on slightly damp hair. But no, I feel as though my hair must be almost bone dry for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s putty to do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, price wins in the end. It does a good enough job that I don&#x27;t feel as though I need so switch back to products four times the cost of this putty. I don&#x27;t highly recommend it, but if you&#x27;re looking for a lower cost alternative to something like American Crew, Aveda or Redken, this isn&#x27;t a terrible choice compared to some of the other things being passed off as grooming clay/putty.something like American Crew, Aveda or Redken, this isn&#x27;t a terrible choice compared to some of the other things being passed off as grooming clay/putty.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on a review in a woman&#x27;s magazine.  I have a short haircut and I like to add texture, definition and sometimes some spiking or &amp;#34;bed head.&amp;#34; I have tried so many products designed for this, partly because I am a hair product junkie (I had a different word over junkie but was pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t appropriate for a review) and partly because I have been trying for a couple years to find a product to replace the uber expensive salon only sculpting paste/wax/putty I adore.  It&#x27;s not available to me any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed feelings on this product.  On the one hand, it is reasonably priced (especially with coupons and store sales) has a nice scent, easy to spread on your hands/fingers for application and has awesome hold.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s very quick to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; for lack of a better term and therefore, you best get the style right the first time. There is very little time once you have it in your hair to style it before you&#x27;d have to add more or wash your hair to start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it very heavy and it&#x27;s wise to start with a little and learn how much you need.  It does indicate &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish and it really is. I have virtually no shine or gloss to my hair once it&#x27;s in. If you use too much, you might find your hair doesn&#x27;t look as clean as you&#x27;d like it too.  Also, despite how thoroughly I wash my hair, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s completely washed out.  I&#x27;d recommend buying a clarifying shampoo to use every few days if you plan to use this product on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up adding a small amount of styling gel (which I thankfully had) that I mix with it when I am spreading on my fingers.  It helps prolong styling time but I don&#x27;t think it should be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do feel it&#x27;s a good product, and probably someone with an even shorter cut than mine would find it easier to use.  However, I will say that even with my very thick hair (my stylist actually thins it every time I get it cut) it does hold the style really well.  It&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you&#x27;re not in love with your current product, or you&#x27;ve just gone short and haven&#x27;t found that perfect styling paste.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers go into greater detail so I&#x27;ll be succinct- this is almost impossible to wash out of hair.  Regular shampoo hasn&#x27;t worked, so I&#x27;ll try the shampoo+baking soda combo some reviewers have suggested.  Use this product at your own peril, really terrible.</li>
    <li> This is an exception because I do not generally write reviews. I used this product for 2 days, I did not use an excess amount of the product in my hair, and I applied the product with a towel dried head of hair.  After two days, like the other reviews have mentioned, I could not get the putty out of my hair, and it felt extremely dirty.  DO NOT buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you are reading this after having purchased and used the product and you are searching for a way to clean your hair, the only success I&#x27;ve had in doing so is using baking soda and shampoo.  I took a rather large amount of baking soda (medium hand full?), mixed it with a similar amount of shampoo and threw it into my wet hair. Most of the product came out, but on the sides of my head where I was not as diligent, some product is left and I will likely have to wait a few days for it to work itself out.</li>
    <li> J. Schultz really has it nailed with his review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I might not have the easiest hair ever. It&#x27;s supposed to be straight, but it has a few cowlicks and kinda does what it wants. I decided a few years ago just to go with that, so I keep it very short and rough it up. My hair is extremely thick, but the individual hairs are skinny. I don&#x27;t want the shiny or crisp look, and I don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune getting my hair to look like I just got out of bed only less so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First morning I used this, I worked a modest amount into my hands to warm it up and then applied it to my head. It basically did what I wanted, so I declared victory and drove to work. Got halfway there and wondered what perfumed person I&#x27;d recently given a ride to, or what perfumed person my *husband* had given a ride to. Odd. Well, I&#x27;d think about that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once at work, I again encountered the smell of the perfumed person. It took longer than it probably should have to realize that *I* was the perfumed person, and by the time I figured it out, my eyes were watering. My co-worker walked in and said &#x27;Wow - never known you to wear perfume before.&#x27; That did it, and I stuck my head in the utility sink under the hottest water I could stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This washed (most of) the smell out, but not the crap. Since I was on the clock, I didn&#x27;t have time to search for a suitable solvent. I&#x27;m sure we had something - options included GooGone, orange hand cleaner, and Simple Green. Napalm might have been better. I simply threw on a skullcap and went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once home, I took a shower and washed my hair. And washed my hair. And washed my hair. Three days later (not of continuous showers, mind you) the last of it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure where I go from here. I&#x27;ve tried various hair products. Maybe I&#x27;ll try gap filler or construction adhesive. Either of those wouldn&#x27;t smell so bad and would probably wash out more easily. They&#x27;d cost less, too. Or maybe I&#x27;ll just shave my head.</li>
    <li> I have thick short hair that is very unruly. I have tried various pomades, from AXE to Old Spice and everything in between. This is by far the best putty I have ever used. The hold and smell are fantastic. I have not had any issues with washing out this product from my hair. I highly recommend this putty.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews on stuff, except on occasion when I REALLY love something or REALLY hate it.  This product merits the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the TXT IT 02 Hyper-Fix Putty, and I must say, it is by far the worst hair product I have ever used.  It worked great as far as styling, except for the tacky feeling that remained, but after only three days of using it, I had a disgusting buildup of very sticky, waxy residue in my hair.  I had been thoroughly shampooing every single day, yet I still could not get it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After those three days, I quit using the Putty, shampooed my hair three times one day, and the residue was STILL there.  It was only after another two or three days of vigorous shampooing in the morning that my hair was finally free of the gunk.  This was not a matter of using too much product, as I only applied an amount slightly less than dime-size to my very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I will not be using any more of this product, and I wasted $3.97+sales tax at Walmart on this horrible product.  This is a shoddy product that L&#x27;Oreal needs to seriously consider pulling from shelves if they don&#x27;t want to lose customers.</li>
    <li> Im really picky about my hair products, but this one is great! Very similar to crew&#x27;s fiber except a lot cheaper, plus it smells great! Pick it up at target for like $6.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at Walmart for about four dollars.&lt;br /&gt;The main problem I have with this is...I&#x27;ve never had short hair before. I&#x27;ve never really styled my hair before either. This was one of the first products I tried when styling my short pixie.&lt;br /&gt;The actual issue is this stuff dries almost instantly. There&#x27;s not a lot of time to play around and get the perfect look. It also left a few flakes in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice scent though. It&#x27;s cheap. Love the matte look because shiny hair always looks a little greasy on me.&lt;br /&gt;So...I will continue to use this until it&#x27;s all gone, but I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WASH OUT OF HAIR. This needs to be pulled from the shelves.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different hair products.  To style, this product is pretty good, but when it comes to washing it off, by far THE WORST PRODUCT TO WASH OFF.  Impossible to wash off the first day with regular shampoo no matter how many times you try.  After 7 attempts to wash it off, finally decided to mix baking soda with shampoo and it worked.  THE WORST PRODUCT TO WASH OFF.</li>
    <li> Washed my hair 5 times and ran a fine tooth comb through my hair each time and could not get this product out of my hair.  My hair feels stiff and dirty and will stay in place even after the 5 washes.  Absolutely awful product.</li>
    <li> I found this at my local Safeway. It&#x27;s cheaper than comparable Axe/Old Spice/American Crew products and there is more product in it as well (4oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very strong. Put it in your hair, style it, and it should stay that way for 24 hours or perhaps even longer. One thing I did find is that, due to its strength, it takes a bit more shampoo than usual to wash it out of your hair. But that isn&#x27;t too much of an issue, especially if you are the type to only wash your hair once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an understated almost fruity scent that is more refreshing than it is overpowering. After a few hours you won&#x27;t really smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a matte finish that I like. If you are going for the shiny look steer clear of this putty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you run your hands through your hair after this product is applied you shouldn&#x27;t be left with any annoying sticky residue on your palms. Though, the tough nature of the putty necessarily means that it is harder to run your hands through your hair in the first place...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is an awesome hair product. I have really unruly hair and this stuff keeps it in place all day after a little bit of manipulating with a comb. It is a bit pricier on Amazon than I would prefer, so your best bet is to check out your local Wal-Mart or Grocery store. It sells pretty fast in my experience, so better grab them while you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 8/6/2014***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after using this product for a few months I&#x27;ve begun to see why its garnered a few one star ratings. It&#x27;s definitely NOT designed for longer hair. As mine grew out it made my hair flat, dry, and crusty. The trick was to use as little as possible, but that got a bit annoying to regulate. I would still recommend this item for those with short, greasier hair as it&#x27;ll hold any style and won&#x27;t dry you out. For those with longer styles it might be time to move on.</li>
    <li> How is this getting any negative reviews?  I have purchased the most expensive hard products and this one can easily run with the most expensive waxes. They also give you DOUBLE the average 1.6-2.0 ounce size--IT&#x27;s 4 full ounces for $6!!!&lt;br /&gt;EXTREMELY strong hold with a nice smell.  It is a strong wax but as with ANY strong waxes, it takes a couple shampoos to completely wash out.  The biggest complainers are people who have never purchased strong wax.  There is always a trade-off between strong hold and ease of washing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is washing it out such a big deal? If you like your hair--you re-apply it after you wash it anyways??? Right??  So you have to use less the next time;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great hold. Smells good but not strong. Doesn&#x27;t give you the gel or wet hair appearance.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local store. Price is great, smells awesome, the hold is great. My complaint is that it dries too quickly and I cannot get it to wash out of my hair.</li>
    <li> What you&#x27;re buying is really nice-smelling glue. I&#x27;ve washed my hair four times, and I still haven&#x27;t gotten all this s*** out. Worst product ever.</li>
    <li> really good hold. make sure to use very little at a time since its such a strong product. looks nice. would reconmend.</li>
    <li> I preface this review by stating that I have very thick, straight hair that needs a strong paste to style it.  Pomade won&#x27;t cut it.  I have used several options and have yet to find one worth complaining about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was forced to purchase this because I refuse to pay for overpriced Axe products and I couldn&#x27;t find my other go-to products at my local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression was fine.  I put it in my hair, styled it, and was out the door.  No complaints.  Unfortunately, I touched my hair later and it felt awful- like really dirty hair after a week of using too much product without washing out.  My wife would NOT enjoy that.  I wasn&#x27;t completely upset until I tried to wash it out.  I began by putting the normal amount of shampoo in my hair.  I lathered, rinsed, yet it still felt dirty.  The next time I used gobs of shampoo and lathered really well, then I let it sit in my hair for a couple minutes.  Once again, it still felt dirty.  I had to get ready for work, so I couldn&#x27;t go back for my third wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to think it was just my imagination so I continued to use it for a few days with the same result.  Shampooing everyday then reapplying the following day.  When I went to my hairstylist, she asked if I had product in my hair (I washed my hair before I went to her!).  She confirmed my suspicion.  She washed my hair with a combination of shampoo and baking soda and it finally came out.  She told me to throw this product away, and I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If no one touches your hair and you don&#x27;t mind hair that feels filthy even after cleaning, then this product is for you.  Otherwise, be warned.</li>
    <li> Usually get axe products. However, since I am growing my hair longer they no longer does the trick. Need something that will hold my hair in place with out the crunchy feel. Found this and like this a lot. It sticky and it stays for a long time.  I can run my hands through my hair and re-style it easily.  Only thing I do not like. Is that when you shampoo your hair it does not come out the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I have longer and thicker hair than average.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Great hold.&lt;br /&gt;2. Very matte.&lt;br /&gt;3. Decent smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Kind of dirty feeling&lt;br /&gt;2. Hard to wash out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 1 year now and for the price I can not complain. It works well I don&#x27;t know why these people have troubl washing it out. I have no such problem. It&#x27;s 9 bucks for pretty darn good product. I recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using pureology texture twist until now! Since they have discontinued the pureology product, I have been looking for something that works like it or better. I&#x27;m tired of paying $60 for a discontinued item! Not now...This product works great! Even better then the texture twist.&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and don&#x27;t like using hairspray, you don&#x27;t need it with this. Works great when you put it on wet hair or dry. I like a messy or spiky look and this product does it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yea! no more paying a high price!</li>
    <li> Best product for men with super thick hair. doesn&#x27;t make hands sticky. Smells good. Holds stubborn hair in position very well. Regardless of price this is the best product iv found. Can apply to wet, damp, or dry hair NBD. Love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff shouldn&#x27;t be used on human hair. It&#x27;s horrendous to clean out, I contemplated shaving my head after 15 washes (3 days of 5 shampooing) it came out. A complete waste of TIME (tons of time) and money (luckily it was cheap)</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and this allows me to have style !!</li>
    <li> Incredibly good for one and a half to two inch hair. Although I think I may have gotten it cheaper at Safeway.  I get the impression that a lot of reviewers don&#x27;t know how to use products like this. First, use a hair dryer (and maybe flat iron) to get your hair going in the right directions. Then use a small amount of putty, working it into your palms/fingers first and then &amp;#34;palming&amp;#34; it into your hair. Don&#x27;t rake it through with fingers. Then sculpt and twist pieces into the right texture and shape. Tip the pieces with a little more product for durability, and finish with a light dusting of hair spray.</li>
