<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:34eae4f89b13ff4a0c79696b136b099]] I feel cheated. This is what I received in the mail. I ordered this based off of the picture presented on Amazon.com and I thought that this was a good product for the price. Well, I did not get what was represented.</li>
    <li> was a Gift for My Niece, she say they are great to use.</li>
    <li> I love this. Well worth the wait when you calculate how much it costs to add these types of things to your nails at the salon.</li>
    <li> Expected just a little more according to their photo! But 2 dollars don&#x27;t get much nowadays.! I&#x27;m sure they will be oh use for my projects...</li>
    <li> Even though some people didn&#x27;t get what is pictured, I did and I do really like them. They are a metallic type of nail stud with some really pretty colors, not just the average silver and gold you typically get with metallic studs. They do come in three sizes, all suitable for nail art. The only downside is they have a concave back instead of a flat back so when applying I&#x27;ve had to use a larger glob of clear polish to stick it on and you really need to make sure you seal it onto the nail really well.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as I thought! nice metallic colors and each compartment is full</li>
    <li> Girlfriend uses them as bindi stones and loves them.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is having a blast with her nail art bling, she has no issues getting the studs to stay put on her nails. This item did come from overseas, yet it got here approximately two weeks before the early of the 2 expected delivery dates, very happy with this item and  broad fashion!</li>
    <li> You only get half of what it shows in the picture. They look pretty cheap. but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Gemstones aren&#x27;t as deeply colored as they appear in the picture but are still nice. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> These studs are really great!  Different sizes and different colors!!  They look really good on my nails!  When applying them, I picked them up with an x-acto knife and dipped them in nail glue!  Every single one of them stayed on and I&#x27;m pretty rough on my hands.  Mostly importantly, the color on the stones lasted well too!  I wore them on my nails for a whole week!  If you&#x27;re a nail art junkie like myself and need a little of everything in your collection...put these on your wish list!! ;) Shipped early as well!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. I would order again. It was shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I got it before it was expected and the colors are all very pretty. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because its not very full. Its not horrible but I was hoping it would be fuller.</li>
    <li> I think I got this, I ordered so much one day, I&#x27;ll have to check my stash, lol</li>
    <li> Cute nail deco at an amazing price. The shipping speed was a tad bit legnthy, but i will buy again!</li>
    <li> Very nice colors and are small so they don&#x27;t overpower your nail.</li>
    <li> I was definitely really excited about these but when I got them they were not as shiny as I hoped they would be. I&#x27;ll still use them but they look cheap. :(</li>
    <li> Thought they we&#x27;re a little bit bigger</li>
    <li> Like them but not as full as shown in picture</li>
    <li> Smaller then I thought. I haven&#x27;t use them yet.</li>
    <li> Grand children loved them.</li>
    <li> Sure doesn&#x27;t look like the add.</li>
    <li> Very small. Not what I thought it would be. Nice.</li>
    <li> I have to say although these are a nice variety of size and color, they are not as bright or as reflective as I&#x27;m used to. They seem to be hollow (making them  extremely  hard to pick up they keep flipping over,and makes them a little harder to adhere.  Also with the colors all mixed together it is hard to find multiple of the same color in a timely fashion at the salon.</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;Not overwhelming and flashy.</li>
    <li> Product was promptly deliverd but quality is poor. Very dull not as represented.</li>
    <li> Cute gems. It took a while to get them, but I would purchase them again. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> They look just as the picture shows. They come in various sizes and colors. I just wish they were color organized.</li>
    <li> These came exactly how its pictured. I love all the bright colors.</li>
    <li> GOOD QUALITY. COLORS ARE JUMMBELED TOGETHER BASED ON SIZE. A BIT CHAOTIC IN MY OPINION. GREAT COLORS.</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t very much in the container, I am very disappointed! I don&#x27;t think its going to last very long at all!  :(</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Very little pieces arrived. Dull colors. Very tiny. Smaller than 2mm.</li>
    <li> judging by the reviews, theyre exactly what i expected. i thought they were&#x27;nt super packed so i got two, very pretty and shiny. i&#x27;m very happy with them cant wait to use them. i got them in like two weeks.</li>
    <li> It look so matte in real live ,not cheap at all.</li>
    <li> Good product, lots of color choices</li>
    <li> They are gorgeous,  but you should make some bigger ones like 5 mm</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted. It was very small and not what the picture showed me. It is not good.</li>
    <li> Look like plastic, I wanted metal. But I will use them on my toes.</li>
    <li> You get what you purchase.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews before buying this, I figured it should have been too good to be true but I did not get what is pictured. More like half of it and they aren&#x27;t even that great looking, very disappointed. So tiny.... I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> The color is faded, they arent 2mm let alone 3mm, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> rusty looking... not shiny and pretty at all</li>
    <li> I would give it 0 star, it does not look like picture, I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> The container is no where near as full as it is in the picture.  They are cute but very sad there was so little gems in the container.</li>
    <li> I thought the colors were going to be more vibrant. They are shaped like gems with a metallic finish. Still cool, just not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Cute nail art pieces.  Advertised as metallic, but mine looked more pastel than metallic.  Still a good product and will look nice on nails.</li>
    <li> The colors were dull and looked nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with others that what is pictured here isn&#x27;t exactly what you get. In the picture they look super bright but the ones I got were dull but for the price I can&#x27;t really complain and will still use them.</li>
