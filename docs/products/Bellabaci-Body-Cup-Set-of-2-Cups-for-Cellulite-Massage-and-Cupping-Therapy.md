### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought this body cup set a month ago, and am REALLY impressed with the results.</li>
      <li>Perfect product for helping with cellulite!</li>
      <li>Very nice product!!!</li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>Its brilliant for cellulite</li>
      <li>Ugh, the things we must go through to feel good about ourselves!</li>
      <li>Ugh, the things we must go through to feel good about ourselves!</li>
      <li>I was happy with my progress</li>
      <li>Would happily recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>I found it to be a very effective, non-invasive option, unlike any drug-based treatments, which cures superficially and does not target the underlying cause and hence boomerangs when the effect of medicine subsides.</li>
      <li>I do feel they are working because my legs feel smoother and the pain from using them has begun to feel good.</li>
      <li>Either way it still felt good</li>
      <li>I am now 42 and try to keep in good shape but have cellulite like everyone else out there that have had kids not to mention stretch marks.</li>
      <li>wala your good to go</li>
      <li>You will be glad you did!</li>
      <li>If you have embarrassing cellulite and can&#x27;t afford to go to a doctor or just don&#x27;t want to because it&#x27;s embarrassing then buy this body cup and have your cellulite taken care of in no time in the comfort of your own home for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Because I own a holistic practice I will probably buy the teachers kit and do this in my shoppe along with body wraps I offer.  </li>
      <li>Kind of a tingly sensation.</li>
      <li>My legs are nice looking with muscle in the front</li>
      <li>My thigh felt soooo much better, and had a nice warm tingle and flow to it.</li>
      <li>&quot; I have out there :)</li>
      <li>&quot; I have out there :)</li>
      <li>and I could just notice it more or what.</li>
      <li>but you get used to it :)</li>
      <li>It gets better and easier</li>
      <li>This is a great product and it absolutely makes sense.  </li>
      <li>so the results be even better..</li>
      <li>hope I continue for many more weeks</li>
      <li>and I love how they make me feel afterwards.</li>
      <li>Yesterday I worked my legs out pretty good, and I was feeling to soreness today.</li>
      <li>, right!?!?</li>
      <li>The only \\&quot;problem\\&quot; I have is that in the directions it says to use the softer cup, but I am unsure as to which one that is lol.</li>
      <li>I ordered these literally last night around 5 pm, and have the prime shipping (god I love amazon!) and received them at 10 am today!</li>
      <li>Yes, so simple idea yet very effective...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pregnant, the only thing I can say is done of really good material, I can weight to used them :)</li>
      <li>I am so excited to keep using these cups, they are so relaxing</li>
      <li>and then I was ok, and would then work my way up to higher suction.</li>
      <li>Body Cup Set is a relatively new concept for me but since have started, have to say i find it really nice and relaxing.</li>
      <li>Nice side effect is very soft moisturized</li>
      <li>My thighs not look much smoother, and fell much better.  </li>
      <li>I use Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Skin Care Oil in conjunction with the cups and \\&quot;wipe\\&quot; it off with a towel when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
      <li>Also makes my skin feel fresh, smooth and glowing.</li>
      <li>I must say that my legs look so much smoother, I have more confidence when I wear my shorts</li>
      <li>I bought massage oil from Natural Grocers and use on my thighs and buttocks to help the cups glide over the skin more easily.</li>
      <li>but they certainly do work and feel great on massages and blood circulation especially if your having digestive problems you massage your stomach with these and</li>
      <li>It really works!!</li>
      <li>The first time I used the cups, I did them dilegently every day for a month before I saw a significant difference.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say completely gone, but I have friends who think I have none (from the better days when I venture out in shorts/mini&#x27;s.)  </li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>and I started using them right away.</li>
      <li>no more they are a great investment</li>
      <li>I love the cute little box they come in too!</li>
      <li>Even my husband has noticed the difference - and that really says something!</li>
      <li>Later applications were even more relaxing and calming like the feel one gets after a body rejuvenation spa.  </li>
      <li>I am not cellulite free, but I don&#x27;t feel as self conscious wearing shorts now.</li>
      <li>I am not cellulite free, but I don&#x27;t feel as self conscious wearing shorts now.</li>
      <li>At first it took me a bit to get used to the cup</li>
      <li>Let me first start off by saying that my situation is the toughest you can get for getting rid of cellulite.  </li>
      <li>If you have cellulite be sure to get this before beach season rolls back around!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money and highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Stretch marks are more subtle and my legs look more toned already.</li>
      <li>I am now on my 4th week of cupping and trying to be good about doing it everyday, but realistically it is more like every other day.</li>
      <li>Today, I feel more positive after having used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Though it may seem to be slightly pricey but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I had to be disciplined to do it every single night for 90 days and it worked for me:)</li>
      <li>I am a long time cup user and I thought this might be good to have with my vacuum cupping set.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been athletic my whole life.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have much pain, like some of the reviewers have talked about.</li>
      <li>and I really hope to see results in my cellulite.</li>
      <li>but now I really like it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much visible improvement.</li>
      <li>The suction from the cups was very comforting and felt as never before.</li>
      <li>When it started to hurt too much I would decrease the suction</li>
      <li>and I can tell that it really works...</li>
      <li>and maybe it&#x27;s because my main focus is always the fronts of my thighs since that&#x27;s all I can see</li>
      <li>This may be OK with new users but I am not sure if it&#x27;s right for the regular users.</li>
      <li>This is the first thing that has actually helped reduce the look of it.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny and in the long run will show results.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I noticed a little bruising but if you start short amount of time using it the first time and work your way up, you should not have any problems...and the bruising was not bad, just barely noticable</li>
      <li>Maybe 10% better, although it is hard to tell - this may be wishful thinking.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how a little silicone cup can do so much, but I refuse to do any of those expensive laser, lipo treatments that do not work, so this is the next best thing!</li>
      <li>I am 35 years old, 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and 150lbs, very athletic - and can&#x27;t believe how gross my legs look.</li>
      <li>I noticed an improvement within the second week, and although the cellulite hasn&#x27;t completely vanished yet, the improvement is really drastic.</li>
      <li>First off, I bought a long mirror as well as baby oil.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s 2 silicone little cups, nothing special.</li>
      <li>I have been suffering from migraine headaches since my high school days, often unbearable, as it would hit out of the blue.</li>
      <li>They seemed a little pricey for what they actually are, but I was pleasantly surprised and they were worth every penny!</li>
      <li>this product have 2 cups inside but 1 cup of these was yellow color not as like a new product will be.</li>
      <li>did a lot of research and found that dry brushing and bellabaci cups can really make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When I went downstairs to get some water that leg barely hurt at all!</li>
      <li>One of my friends recommended Bellabaci, Body Cup Set and as my other medication was not having much effect on the pain, so I thought of giving it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;The cups are soft and flexible.</li>
      <li>Cellulite creams only go so far and they work</li>
      <li>I can say I got smart and realized that I needed some other items to make this work.</li>
      <li>Even though I watch my diet and try to get to the gym several time a week, having hormonal changes and thyroid issues + knee problems + four hours of sitting in the car + 8 hours behind a desk makes it easy for cellulite to accumulate.  </li>

<li> and it&#x27;s stupid because you really cannot see all the areas without a mirror and having a long cheap mirror you can bring to the bathroom for a little bit of privacy and to see all the areas you want to target is smart.  </li>
<li> I am using these for long term cellulite on thighs.</li>
<li> I have some pain while using these, like some of the other reviewers talk about, but it seems to break up the cellulite and it gets absorb back into the body.  </li>
<li> I saw a difference immediately in the overall tightness of my skin and less dimpling in my thighs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I give these a 3. i have been cupping every night for about 3 weeks. I am using these for long term cellulite on thighs. I do feel they are working because my legs feel smoother and the pain from using them has begun to feel good. I think they are breaking up congestion under the skin. I haven&#x27;t seen much visible improvement. Maybe 10% better, although it is hard to tell - this may be wishful thinking. I will continue to use them for another month or so as they seem to help break up the painful fat layers. I have had this cellulite for a long time so perhaps the visual look will improve over time.</li>
    <li> This is the smartest thing I ever bought! Let me first start off by saying that my situation is the toughest you can get for getting rid of cellulite.  Even though I watch my diet and try to get to the gym several time a week, having hormonal changes and thyroid issues + knee problems + four hours of sitting in the car + 8 hours behind a desk makes it easy for cellulite to accumulate.  I have tried to apply creams, massage the areas, and work out with little luck to rid the cellulite, however these Bellabaci cups have literally changed my life!  They came within three days of ordering them.  I have been using them for about a week now and had skipped a few nights as I was working, however i have already seen a difference!  I can say I got smart and realized that I needed some other items to make this work. First off, I bought a long mirror as well as baby oil.  I was trying for a few days to do this without a mirror and it&#x27;s stupid because you really cannot see all the areas without a mirror and having a long cheap mirror you can bring to the bathroom for a little bit of privacy and to see all the areas you want to target is smart.  The baby oil is relatively inexpensive for a big bottle so I applied it to my legs, butt, belly, etc. and then started using the cup.  At first it took me a bit to get used to the cup but now I really like it.I can still feel it hours after I used the cupping method.  Then after I apply the oil and do the Bellabaci massage, I shower to get the oils off. I can say that I have already noticed firmer skin and less cellulite. Because I own a holistic practice I will probably buy the teachers kit and do this in my shoppe along with body wraps I offer.  This is a great product and it absolutely makes sense.  It is worth every penny and in the long run will show results. Cellulite creams only go so far and they work I believe because of the massage involved. Use this product alone with oil or before you apply a body wrap or cellulite cream.  You will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Just like working out, you gotta work at it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s different but i am slowing seeing a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It is a neat concept.</li>
    <li> I just recently lost weight been working out really hard at the gym. I was happy with my progress but I still notice I had cellulite on my thighs. I tried all types of leg exercises but nothing worked. My legs are nice looking with muscle in the front but the back and sides of my thighs needed help. I received the cups the 1st week of July and I started using them right away. I must say that my legs look so much smoother, I have more confidence when I wear my shorts and I will recommend this products to anyone with cellulite problems.</li>
    <li> so i bought them to get rid of cellulite and i know they work i just never really use them because im too lazy but they certainly do work and feel great on massages and blood circulation especially if your having digestive problems you massage your stomach with these and wala your good to go&lt;br /&gt;if your thinknin about getting these think no more they are a great investment</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from migraine headaches since my high school days, often unbearable, as it would hit out of the blue. One of my friends recommended Bellabaci, Body Cup Set and as my other medication was not having much effect on the pain, so I thought of giving it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;The cups are soft and flexible. I applied the cups to the base of my neck for a few seconds and I felt a soothing effect around the neck muscles, as if tension there being released, which is often the main cause of headaches. The suction from the cups was very comforting and felt as never before. Later applications were even more relaxing and calming like the feel one gets after a body rejuvenation spa.  The cupped area feels so soft and tender; I believe it happens due to increased circulation in that area. Today, I feel more positive after having used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Though it may seem to be slightly pricey but worth every penny. I found it to be a very effective, non-invasive option, unlike any drug-based treatments, which cures superficially and does not target the underlying cause and hence boomerangs when the effect of medicine subsides.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for helping with cellulite! If you have embarrassing cellulite and can&#x27;t afford to go to a doctor or just don&#x27;t want to because it&#x27;s embarrassing then buy this body cup and have your cellulite taken care of in no time in the comfort of your own home for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> this product have 2 cups inside but 1 cup of these was yellow color not as like a new product will be.</li>
    <li> I bought this body cup set a month ago, and am REALLY impressed with the results. I&#x27;ve had terrible cellulite on my tummy since having 2 children.  Even my husband has noticed the difference - and that really says something! I noticed an improvement within the second week, and although the cellulite hasn&#x27;t completely vanished yet, the improvement is really drastic. Would happily recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am 5&#x27;6 110 lbs and have had 4 kids...I am now 42 and try to keep in good shape but have cellulite like everyone else out there that have had kids not to mention stretch marks. I have used this item a few times and it has made a noticable difference. The first time I used it, I noticed a little bruising but if you start short amount of time using it the first time and work your way up, you should not have any problems...and the bruising was not bad, just barely noticable so do be startled. Stretch marks are more subtle and my legs look more toned already. Well worth the money and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a whim, as I&#x27;m going on vacation to a tropical locale soon and am embarrassed to wear shorts because of the cellulite on my legs. I am 35 years old, 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and 150lbs, very athletic - and can&#x27;t believe how gross my legs look. Anyway, when these arrived, I looked up YouTube videos on how to do this since the instructions were really short and vague. After the 2nd day of using these my husband (who doesn&#x27;t even notice when I cut 5 inches off my hair) commented that my legs looked different- &amp;#34;somehow better&amp;#34; - and I hadn&#x27;t told him about the cups! I have been using these every 2 or 3 days now for about a month and now I have the confidence to wear shorts again! Now, when I bought these I was very skeptical that anything could change the look of cellulite for more than a few hours, I mean, that&#x27;s what they tell us, right? Well, I still do have cellulite on my butt and just below the butt - and maybe it&#x27;s because my main focus is always the fronts of my thighs since that&#x27;s all I can see - so don&#x27;t think it will all go away instantly. But it DOES diminish noticebly. I would recommend this to anyone who has cellulite like I do. I&#x27;m still working on the butt and the area below but at least I can wear shorts now. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find anything that worked. Thank you Bellabaci!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review for purely selfish reasons.  I want this company to stay in business so I can repurchase if necessary!  Great product!  I&#x27;ve been athletic my whole life.  Unfortunately, nature doesn&#x27;t care!  I struggle with stage 1 and 2 lines and dimples around the upper and back thigh.&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research and found that dry brushing and bellabaci cups can really make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the results would be without my additional routine (yoga 3x a week, lots of water, TRY to cut out wheat and cheese) but when I do all together, I notice a difference.  The first time I used the cups, I did them dilegently every day for a month before I saw a significant difference.  Now, if I do them every time after yoga (3x a week) I find that is enough upkeep.  I wouldn&#x27;t say completely gone, but I have friends who think I have none (from the better days when I venture out in shorts/mini&#x27;s.)  I use Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Skin Care Oil in conjunction with the cups and \\&quot;wipe\\&quot; it off with a towel when I&#x27;m done.  Nice side effect is very soft moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  If I stop, it returns.  So, this is a lifelong addition to my beauty regimen.  Like hair, face and nails.&lt;br /&gt;I was also looking at the body buffer machine and would like to give it a try however the cost stops me from experimenting!&lt;br /&gt;That is all ladies!  These work.</li>
    <li> I had seen the technique of cupping on a TV show, so ordered this set to give it a try.  I have some pain while using these, like some of the other reviewers talk about, but it seems to break up the cellulite and it gets absorb back into the body.  My thighs not look much smoother, and fell much better.  I am continuing to use these and recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> This was a bad purchase, not happy at all! There&#x27;s 2 silicone little cups, nothing special. The price is not justified!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product!!! I just started to use it and I can tell that it really works...it was painful in the beginning but you get used to it :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet bc I&#x27;m pregnant, the only thing I can say is done of really good material, I can weight to used them :)</li>
    <li> I am a long time cup user and I thought this might be good to have with my vacuum cupping set.  However I was very disappointed when I received it.  It has minimal  suction and  provides very little effect.  This may be OK with new users but I am not sure if it&#x27;s right for the regular users.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this online to get rid of my cellulite and I have already started to see results. If you have cellulite be sure to get this before beach season rolls back around!</li>
    <li> Body Cup Set is a relatively new concept for me but since have started, have to say i find it really nice and relaxing. Its brilliant for cellulite and I have noticed my thighs and buttock look more firm and tight just after a few times of using it. Also makes my skin feel fresh, smooth and glowing.</li>
    <li> I bought Bellabaci cups after a recommendation from a YouTube video I watched for cellulite reduction. They seemed a little pricey for what they actually are, but I was pleasantly surprised and they were worth every penny! I used the cups for 2 weeks, trying to cup everyday for 10-12 minutes per leg. I saw a difference immediately in the overall tightness of my skin and less dimpling in my thighs. By the end of the second week though, I thought it looked a little worse. Don&#x27;t know if that was bc it was breaking up all of the fat and I could just notice it more or what. Despite that, I didn&#x27;t get discouraged and kept on cupping!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning, the first couple of times of cupping can be  painful and uncomfortable! You can actually feel the \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; up of the connective tissue that is causing the dimpled look of cellulite. No pain no gain, right!?!? It gets better and easier so don&#x27;t stop. I bought massage oil from Natural Grocers and use on my thighs and buttocks to help the cups glide over the skin more easily. I am now on my 4th week of cupping and trying to be good about doing it everyday, but realistically it is more like every other day. I also try to run and bike to help stimulate my muscles to help break down the fat. I don&#x27;t know how a little silicone cup can do so much, but I refuse to do any of those expensive laser, lipo treatments that do not work, so this is the next best thing! Seriously, I don&#x27;t what desperate woman somewhere decided to suction cup her lumpy skin, but I would personally like to thank her! I think this practice goes way back and was used in Chinese medicine. I would rub cow manure on my thighs if it would cure cellulite, and I know I am not alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a mother of 3, 41yrs old, thin and active but have always had cellulite on my thighs! Chalk it up to bad genetics. This is the first thing that has actually helped reduce the look of it. I would definitely recommend Bellabaci cups even though they are expensive. I know other women with cellulite would do anything and pay any price for something that works! I am not cellulite free, but I don&#x27;t feel as self conscious wearing shorts now. Until they can find a cure, I will be cupping in my bedroom every night while my husband laughs at me and tells me I&#x27;m crazy! Ugh, the things we must go through to feel good about ourselves!

    <li> It really works!! I had to be disciplined to do it every single night for 90 days and it worked for me:)</li>
    <li> I can definitely feel it working... Kind of a tingly sensation. Definitely use with lots a lotion! Will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I ordered these literally last night around 5 pm, and have the prime shipping (god I love amazon!) and received them at 10 am today! Yesterday I worked my legs out pretty good, and I was feeling to soreness today. I bought these for my stupid cellulite, and decided to try them out on one leg. Yeah it kinda hurt for a little bit, but like a different reviewer said no pain no gain. When it started to hurt too much I would decrease the suction and then I was ok, and would then work my way up to higher suction. My thigh felt soooo much better, and had a nice warm tingle and flow to it. When I went downstairs to get some water that leg barely hurt at all! The other leg that I didn&#x27;t massage hurt with every step! I was so amazed. I am so excited to keep using these cups, they are so relaxing and I love how they make me feel afterwards. I love the cute little box they come in too! The only \\&quot;problem\\&quot; I have is that in the directions it says to use the softer cup, but I am unsure as to which one that is lol. Either way it still felt good and I really hope to see results in my cellulite. I will post an update later on!</li>
    <li> Yes, so simple idea yet very effective... i have been using it for about a week and already can see the difference .. hope I continue for many more weeks so the results be even better..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On thing i also do is drink a glass of water before the massage and after  as well as green tea after the massage it really helps to eliminate toxins and drain all  out of your body...</li>
    <li> I have lost some weight lately, but still have trouble with cellulite on my legs and butt.  After a recommendation from a friend, I decided to give these a try.  It sounded weird, but knowing it was an old Chinese technique, I went ahead and gave it a try.  I use them almost everyday for a couple of weeks, and started to see improvement.  I didn&#x27;t have much pain, like some of the reviewers have talked about.</li>
