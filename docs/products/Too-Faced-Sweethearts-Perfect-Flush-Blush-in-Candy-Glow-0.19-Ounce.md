      <li>I think it&#x27;s a great blush, you just need a good angled brush for it.</li>
      <li>gorgeous pachaging...</li>
      <li>Well even though she requested it, she still loved it when I presented it to her after I had gift wrapped it for her.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned.</li>
      <li>but I need to put a good amount on to get the color to show up.  </li>

      <li>Really cute!</li>
      <li>Amazing blush.</li>
      <li>This blush is really nice never tried too-faced products, but this is&lt;br /&gt;a keeper.  </li>
      <li>I needed a new blush and many reviews said it went perfect on any skin toneso I decided to go for it.</li>
      <li>dont think this is very much a highlighter on me, but its a great color &amp; doesnt make me look sun burnt</li>
      <li>One of my favorite bkushes.</li>
      <li>Ok...I bought it because the box was sooooo cute...</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I saw it on beauty lish must have and the packaging looked so cute.</li>
      <li>it works more like a rosy highlight rather than a blush.</li>
      <li>I like most of too faced products and this plush is no deferent.</li>
      <li>but I guess it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>whay it is okay</li>
      <li>i like it very much, i love this brand</li>
      <li>more makeup even though she has plenty.</li>
      <li>Love this blush.</li>
      <li>I love this blush.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know too much about makeup, but if your girlfriend likes this type of brand, it will make a great gift.</li>
      <li>I love the packaging, design and colors.</li>
      <li>but if u have a clear nice skin then this will look good</li>
      <li>blush a lil lite for my taste but work good as a highlight on top of another blush or for a very natural glow</li>
      <li>Repeat buyer, the colors are beautiful especially when you get a tan and apply it.</li>
      <li>I wanted a blush that was light but still gave me color.</li>
      <li>This item is perfect if you do not want a heavy blushed look.</li>
      <li>Too light for my already porcelain skin tone.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and light.</li>
      <li>However I still can enjoy it.</li>
      <li>The colour is just perfect to give you that glow you want without too much clown red on your face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned so doesn&#x27;t really show that much.</li>
      <li>For someone who has a very pale skin tone this would probably be perfect.</li>
      <li>Good for very light complexions, slightly sparkly in case</li>
      <li>You can blend the colors together or keep them separate, but either way it will still look great on many different skin types and at different times of the year.</li>
      <li>so this is nice because it&#x27;s more of a sun-kissed look and nothing heavy</li>
      <li>You can choose from three shades so that&#x27;s pretty cool</li>
      <li>I DO love this blush, but the only problem I have with this is that it is not as pigmented as I would like it.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s best to buy makeup from a well trusted place there&#x27;s always issues on reviews about products being fake or defective.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s such a cute blush</li>
      <li>All in all I still really recommend this for anyone.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It gives my cheeks a cute pink color.</li>
      <li>High quality .</li>
      <li>It also last a good amount I use it everyday and it still looks like new.</li>
      <li>Faced products might be nice, but I will never know since their customer service really sucks.</li>
      <li>and I live it.</li>
      <li>I have very very pale skin (lightest for most foundation)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It creates a natural effect in the cheeks</li>
      <li>No wasted powder when you use the brush .  </li>
      <li>so wasn&#x27;t difficult to decide to buy this blush, and the package is lovely, the reason i don&#x27;t gve 5 stars is because it doesnt shines too much lke</li>
      <li>This blush was a request from my girlfriend who apparently &amp;#34;needs&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I bought this blush at Sephora a few months back when it was first coming out.</li>

<li> I bought a few products from TOO FACED Cosmetics themselves.</li>
<li> It looked kinda small to me, but I asked her</li>
<li> The order came in wrong and kept accusing me that it was my fault because I wrote the wrong e-mail address.</li>
<li> Well in fact I e-mailed them after noticing I never got a confirmation e-mail thinking there was something wrong.</li>

    <li> This is a great blush. I love the packaging, design and colors. It is big and I like how it is three different colors. It goes on smooth and light.</li>
    <li> Amazing blush. It creates a natural effect in the cheeks</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this blush!!!! gives me a beautiful glow on my skin and it&#x27;s such a cute blush I love it</li>
    <li> Love this blush. Good for very light complexions, slightly sparkly in case that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re looking for</li>

    <li> One of my favorite bkushes. You can mix all the colors or just pick one. It has a subtle shimmer without being too much. I love Too Faced!</li>

    <li> This is a really great blush! You can blend the colors together or keep them separate, but either way it will still look great on many different skin types and at different times of the year. It is pricey, but you get a lot of blush.</li>
    <li> I like this blush.  It&#x27;s a good color for my completion, wears well and the box is nice.  Ok...I bought it because the box was sooooo cute...but it really is a good blush!</li>

    <li> I like this color but I need to put a good amount on to get the color to show up.  I&#x27;m just getting into wearing makeup regularly so this is nice because it&#x27;s more of a sun-kissed look and nothing heavy but I wish it was a bit darker.  For someone who has a very pale skin tone this would probably be perfect.</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer, the colors are beautiful especially when you get a tan and apply it.</li>
    <li> This blush was a request from my girlfriend who apparently &amp;#34;needs&amp;#34; more makeup even though she has plenty. Well even though she requested it, she still loved it when I presented it to her after I had gift wrapped it for her. It looked kinda small to me, but I asked her and she said it&#x27;s actually a lot for the type of makeup it is.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know too much about makeup, but if your girlfriend likes this type of brand, it will make a great gift.</li>

    <li> I have read mixed reviews on this product. I really like it. It gives my cheeks a cute pink color. The color pay off was great for me. I&#x27;m fair skinned. I would think it would work for a lot of skin tones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned so doesn&#x27;t really show that much. need to put on a couple of layers before you see it but I guess it&#x27;s better than nothing. larger than expected. about the size of my palm!</li>
    <li> I love this blush. I have very very pale skin (lightest for most foundation)&lt;br /&gt;I dont think this is very much a highlighter on me, but its a great color &amp; doesnt make me look sun burnt</li>
    <li> Great color for every complexion .  No wasted powder when you use the brush .  High quality .</li>
    <li> Really cute! I have acne prone skin and it makes my face looks little bit cakey but if u have a clear nice skin then this will look good</li>
    <li> This blush is really nice never tried too-faced products, but this is&lt;br /&gt;a keeper.  You have three different colors or blend as one makes&lt;br /&gt;for a beautiful blush.</li>
    <li> Too light for my already porcelain skin tone.</li>
    <li> whay it is okay&lt;br /&gt;the lasting for it&lt;br /&gt;not that much&lt;br /&gt;and the color you have to scratch to see the color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;any way&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the color doesn&#x27;t come out well and it doesn&#x27;t shine that much I used my fingers and a brush and the result is still the same</li>
    <li> i like it very much, i love this brand so wasn&#x27;t difficult to decide to buy this blush, and the package is lovely, the reason i don&#x27;t gve 5 stars is because it doesnt shines too much lke i spected but it may be  by the brush.</li>
    <li> I thought it will have a great color payoff but I&#x27;m a medium to fair skin it works more like a rosy highlight rather than a blush. However I still can enjoy it.</li>
