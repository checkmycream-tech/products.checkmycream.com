      <li>it need more words</li>
      <li>Though I had to pay to ship the item to them, they promptly returned the unit which now has been working better than it did before.</li>
      <li>Worked great for almost 6 months then would either give us 30 straight seconds and die or just not turn on.</li>
      <li>If I were you, I would spend the money on a better model thats more well known.</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>Now, why can&#x27;t most Customer Service Departments be as responsive as Puresonic?</li>

      <li>I bought two of these, one for my wife and I, and we love them.</li>
      <li>Buy with confidence because it&#x27;s definitely my favorite product purchase of this year</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought three S450 and one S400 for my son.  Out of four NONE works!!!!  The seller puts it on the manufacturer, who have short hours.  It sounds like a bad seal to the motor , a bad battery, AND a bad switch.  So much money involved and still have to use my 6 year old Braun Oral B Sonic.  Glad I saved one! Anyway, DO NOT BUY Pursonic!  It is a waste of your hard earned money.  A product has to bat at least 900 and this one bats 100.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item, it is already peeling on the main unit only had about 35 days, silver is completely coming off, too late to return or I would - buy another brand</li>
    <li> Disappointed! Motor is dying after a little more than a year. Will only run on soft mode. Won&#x27;t stayed charged for more than 1 use, so don&#x27;t attempt t take this on vacation unless you want to take the entire unit. Brush heads don&#x27;t last very long either. Overall disappointed with the quality of the unit.</li>
    <li> Love this item, but love the customer service even more! Had the item for about a year and the uv light stopped working. Contacted Pursonic customer service and a new base was shipped without questions! Received the replacement part in about 4 days.</li>
    <li> My complaint mirrors most others. Initially, when using there would be a momentary stall then it would resume. After approximately two months it failed to start no matter how many times the start button was pressed. Contacted Pursonic C.S. with details and was told to send video. Was unable to take video so I sent in still photos. Never heard from Pursonic C.S. again. Just as well probably as they would have sent an exact replacement and this product obviously has a major problem with the start button.  Would definitely stay clear of this electronic toothbrush and Pursonic in general.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush would be an excellent product if it worked for more than two months. I will not pay another dollar to return this piece of junk to Samsonic. It&#x27;s going straight to the trash as I walk out the door to buy a Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Works very nice.</li>
    <li> Purchased ours a few months ago in 2014 and we were very satisfied with the price, the way it worked on our teeth and all the extra brushes that came with it. However, the handle is not water-proof. If you want to brush while staring into the shower stream or are a very sloppy brusher who&#x27; s hand and handle are covered in goop, this may not be the model for you. About November ours started to act up in a manner very similar to what the one and two star reviews are remarking about. My wife assumed(and well that she should) that an appliance like a toothbrush should be practically immersible so as to facilitate clean-up. She was routinely dunking not just the brush but the handle under running water to rinse it off. Ours began stopping completely after thirty seconds and acting like the battery died. Now we just wipe it with a wet hand and then immediately with a dry towel and it&#x27;s begun to act like it&#x27;s old self again and we are once again very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Once you&#x27;ve rinsed just the brush under water, hold the brush, bristle side down, and press the power button and let it run for a couple of seconds and most, not all, of the water will be flung out and it&#x27;s dry enough to put in the sanitizer.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. I&#x27;m a college kid so I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend unless it&#x27;s for school. I bought it at it lasted for 6 months when the batter went. I would charge it every night and brushed my teeth twice a day. It would start dying by only giving one One-thirty second brushing period and then die for the remaining two minutes. If I were you, I would spend the money on a better model thats more well known.</li>
    <li> Great customer service! We purchased two of these, one of the charging bases had an issue with the UV light not coming on. I e-mailed customer service and within a few days we received a replacement charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had several Sonicare brushes in the past, these seem on par with them - at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far we are pleased with the Pursonic brushes - and very happy with the fast customer service!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to find this on Amazon when it was less than $50.00, but regardless, it is a very good method to help your teeth.  I have had others, but this one system is superior to the others.  And, twelve brushes!!!  Others want a ton just for the three they include.  I recommend that you at least look this over.</li>
    <li> I bought the Pursonic S450 on Groupon. The brush was great initially but then the battery stopped working. I only had the brush for 5 months and the battery stopped working. I tried call the company and they never returned my call.&lt;br /&gt;Bad product and bad customer support. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this toothbrush!!!</li>
    <li> We have been using our Pursonic S450 Deluxe Plus Toothbrush for about a month and we are really pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of other electric toothbrushes, a Braun and a Phillips. The PURSONIC S450 DELUXE PLUS Toothbrush compares quite favorably.  The toothbrush heads feel a little smaller/lighter that the others I&#x27;ve used, but they give you 12 brushes with your handle. The replacement heads on the Braun ahd Phillips are hard to find in the grocery store, and expensive regardless of where you purchase them. Additional brush heads are also available.  I bought this one because the version without the UV sanitizer had a lot of good reviews and it looked like the same brush, and I like the idea of a sanitizer.  I expect in the long run the whole UV sanitizer thing will turn out to be a useless fad, but I have one for now.  One other point of difference on this brush from others I&#x27;ve used is that the thing turns itself off after 2 minutes. I kind of like having just beep when it is done, but leaves you the option to continuw brushing. I often go over 2 minutes. My husband likes the feature and it saves using the on/off button (which is what failed on our previous brush).  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up, but at this time I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d recommend you give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had this now for a few months. Still working well. One point about the toothbrush head holder - fits 4 which is nice, and different head colors make it easy to keep clear which brush belongs to whom. The downside of the brush head holder cup is there is no where for water dripping off the brush heads to drain, so it builds up in the bottom of the cup - have to empty clean goop at the bottom. It does lift out of the stand, and I&#x27;ll probably start putting it in the dishwasher periodically for a good clean. Otherwise, I am still very statisfied with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I agree with most others.  It&#x27;s great when it&#x27;s working.  Mine did last a solid year and stopped right outside the warranty expiration :(  Now it only comes on when it wants too.</li>
    <li> I love it...works great.  Light didn&#x27;t work but they are sending something right away.  Anyone can be good if nothing goes wrong...it is how they handle things when it does and they did great....Thanks...</li>
    <li> This is my second one in a year hopefully this will last longer, the toothbrush works great but last one stopped working after a year wont buy a third if it happens again</li>
    <li> My Pursonic arrived with defective sanitizer, I called the number given in the instructions, was told exactly what info to email Pursonic, and I received in a few hours confirmation that a replacement had been shipped and tracking number! The tooth brush itself works very well.</li>
    <li> Makes my gums feel great, however does not brush my teeth as well as a hand brush</li>
    <li> Bot in July, died in December.  Worked fine for 4 months then would stop after 30 seconds or so and not restart for several minutes. Now it won&#x27;t work at all and I have 9 unusable brushes.</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use. I brush my teeth more after using this for the first time.</li>
    <li> Nice when it worked, didn&#x27;t even work properly for 6 months.  No warranty or response from company</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Worked for about a year then it will not stay on. I press the button and it will vibrate for a second then stop.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing toothbrush.  My dentist loves it I think since there is not much work he needs to do but he told me my teeth are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Its okay, not bad, just wish that it had the little bumps on the oppisite side of the brush to clean your tounge.</li>
    <li> This product was great at first. Now a little over a year the product stops brushing in the middle of my brush session and won&#x27;t turn on again.&lt;br /&gt;This is with a full charge. I&#x27;ve contacted Samsonic and they only offer a 1 year warranty and Amazon warranty period is over as well.&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, the product no longer works to its fullest. I&#x27;m lucky if I can get through a complete brushing session before it turns off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve wasted money. Do Not Buy this product.</li>
    <li> While it might be as fast as my old Sonicare, it really wins on price and features.  I also love the toothbrush head over the Sonicare as well, much easier to clean..   HOWEVER, I have to amend this as it broke just one month after the warranty ran out.</li>
    <li> I just love the power toothbrush. It recharges quickly and holds the charge well. with all of the extra brush heads my whole family can use it. I really love the sanitizing function.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is a bit more sensitive and she likes the adjustable speeds.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great product from beginning to end.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price.</li>
    <li> I liked the toothbrush while it lasted. We have the dual model. One stopped working. I contacted the company by telephone four times and by email. I have never received a return call or email. We are very disappointed in the customer service. Would not purchase again or recommend.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Like the multiple speeds and the Sanitizer compartment.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price.. Plenty of heads, and the UV is nice.. Not sure it works or not.</li>
    <li> Love it...but does not seem quite as strong vibrating as our old S400.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great machine and will clean the gums and teeth, incredible vibrating power and teeth really felt clean after using it. Tons of tooth brushes and glad that it sterilizes the brush after using.</li>
    <li> Great Product I like it need more words what guess go on and on till it gets to the end</li>
    <li> Great while it lasted. Works well, brush bristles are good enough, though the brush heads are hard when they hit your teeth. Only real problem is once it made it to about a year the battery started acting up. It now works fine some days, others I have to keep turning it back on, and yet others not at all. If it wasn&#x27;t for the battery, I&#x27;d rate it much better. I&#x27;ll be purchasing something more expensive as they last longer and will ultimately be cheaper to own.  UPDATE: Ordered another Pursonic, but without the UV. The charge lasts a long time, I feel the problem with this version is to use the UV it must always be plugged in and therefor charging whenever the handle is placed on the unit for storage. It will last if you don&#x27;t use the base for storage. Pursonic could remedy this with a smart charger, non-memory batteries, or a switch to allow charging only when wanted.</li>
    <li> I would write a positive review of this item, but within 24 hours of receiving the item the charging bases stopped working. The handle would not charge and the UV light no longer came on. I attempted to contact the manufacturer to see if they would replace the item, but their telephone system was in an endless loop and would not connect to customer service or an operator. There is a warranty card included but I refuse to pay shipping for the manufacture to fix the product. I will return it and buy a different sonic toothbrush. Too bad, because for the 24 hours it actually worked it cleaned my teeth well.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this model about one month ago and it worked fine since the,. However, I have noticed that the UV light which sanitizes the brushes, no longer turned on after I closed the lid. I have emailed the company to ask for a replacement UV bulb. I have received a reply from their Customer Service within a couple of hours, mentioning that the part is on its way. I have received an entire new base with a new UV light a couple of days later. Now, why can&#x27;t most Customer Service Departments be as responsive as Puresonic? I give this company and their product the highest rating.</li>
    <li> I received my Pursonic about a month ago and I am very pleased I bought it.  I was impressed with the additional brush heads that come with it because these are like $30 for two if you find them on sale.  So far everything is working well.</li>
    <li> Ordered one of the a few months ago.  (not from amazom)  I paid over 100. for this.  worked 3 months .  As you might imagine im not a happy camper.  I love it while it worked.!!!!  Now I have to figure out the next step to get this either fixed or replaced or eat the cost.</li>
    <li> I like this tooth brushing machine only problem for me is the tooth head is small though it would be a little bigger but I guess to get in between the teeth. So far works fine bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> battery life seemed to be a selling point but it does not matter since it has to be plugged in for the ultraviolet lights to sanitise the brushes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two weeks now and so far I likr</li>
    <li> So far this toothbrush works great! As long as it lasts through all 12 head replacements, I feel I&#x27;ve got my money&#x27;s worth. It cleans great! I love the built in UV sanitizer.</li>
    <li> Does a fine job of cleaning your teeth and leaving them nice and smooth. Much cheaper than other name brands out there and does just as good a job.</li>
    <li> better than i had expected - cleans the best of all I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love the timer!!!  I also love how clean my teeth feel and my dentist could tell,,,less plack!</li>
    <li> I bought two for my children both stopped working after 3 months don&#x27;t buy it.  warrenty says I have to pay for shipping after that I may as well buy a new one from a different better manufacturer</li>
    <li> Brush is smaller than most we have used , but OK</li>
    <li> gift for Father&#x27;s Day, arrived on time. Husband loves it, he is just getting over radiation and just what he needed</li>
    <li> I bought one of these 3 years ago. Great toothbrush plus you get replacement. Heads. Great price. And teeth feel great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush because of all it&#x27;s properties, like the built in sanitizer, the extra rush storage and the built in timer. I charged it for the required time, it&#x27;s charging indicator showed it was charging. I pushed the on/off switch and nothing happened, it wouldn&#x27;t work. I returned it. They would only issue a refund and did not even offer a replacement choice. It looks like they have a problem with switch, I&#x27;ve noticed from other reviews I have read.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is basically junk. I bought it through groupon for 49 dollars thinking it was a great deal, but it is the same price as here. It doesn&#x27;t have enough power to clean your teeth, as it just vibrates a bit. Additionally, its really soft bristles don&#x27;t even clean the smallest stain out of the teeth. But the worst part is that it started giving me problems after 2 months and after 3 it no longer turns on. After some research I saw it is sold in a Chinese website called alibaba.com as a low quality item for less than 25 dollars, so you can&#x27;t expect anything good from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I would not recommend this toothbrush to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t do its job right and it stops working after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Stopped working within 3 months, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I use this toothbrush everyday and my teeth have never felt cleaner! its an awesome product and i love that it comes with multiple brush heads in different colors bc i share my bathroom with my sister and this way, we never get mixed up. I also really love that it charges up so i never have to look for batteries and its always in perfect working order. The 2 minute timer is a really neat feature- I realize now Ive probably never before brushed for 2 minutes! All in all no complaints :)</li>
    <li> good toothbrush for the money. We like the sanitizing feature.  Brushes work well.  Timer is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> I loved the toothbrush, and the fact that it hesitates every 30 seconds, so you can brush each quadrant  of your mouth for the suggested time, and then go to the next one!  BUT: I loved it until seven months after purchase, it now no longer functions.</li>
    <li> Bought this from a Groupon deal like others here. Sold on the price and features. Worked great for almost 6 months then would either give us 30 straight seconds and die or just not turn on. Basically I&#x27;ve resorted to brushing old school with my electric toothbrush which is ridiculous. Just do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t. Just don&#x27;t.  Update: I contacted pursonic about my problems who advised it was still under warranty. Though I had to pay to ship the item to them, they promptly returned the unit which now has been working better than it did before. Hopefully it continues to perform.</li>
    <li> Not a Sonic Care, however it works great and the price was increadible!</li>
    <li> I bought this item twice ... And both times, charged it the required time, pushed the button, pushed the button, pushed the button (infinitesimal times) and this junk didn&#x27;t even turn on!!! DO NOT BUY! YOU&#x27;LL GET A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT EVERY TIME!! Is there no quality inspection done prior to boxing and shipping? I&#x27;m done with this product ... I doubt the 3rd time will be the charm. I only give second chances! DONE!</li>
    <li> Total junk! I&#x27;ll never buy the off brand again. If you like to brush your teeth and love the wasted effort this is the toothbrush for you!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he is enjoying it,</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these models at the same time, nearly 2 years ago.  It was a great deal, (nealrly 2 for 1), and I figured one would be used by my wife.  Not realizing that the UV part held four brush heads, making it unnecessary to have 2 plugged in at once, I stored the second one away.  The first one worked great for about a year or so.  Then I started having issues with the start button.  Sometimes it worked other times I had to press it several times, others I gave up completely and just brushed.  Some times it seemed to only turn on with the brush head removed, though this almost certainly has to be coincidence, because there&#x27;s no friction preventing it from vibrating.  Finally after several months of fighting it, I finally threw it away, and opened the second box, which by all accounts, should be like brand new.  Right out of the box, it has the same button problems.  Now it&#x27;s just a bulky regular toothbrush.  Because it was nearly 2 years since I bought it, despite it being essentially a brand new unit, I can&#x27;t send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, if you get one, and the button works, consider yourself fortunate, because when it works, it works great.  My first one lasted a little over 1/2 as long as my Sonicare before the problems started.  The second one didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It acts like it is trying to turn on for about a nanosecond...you can feel the little click, but it just won&#x27;t go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I have to say this product truly falls into the category of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love it.  My teeth have never felt so clean and I get great dental check-ups.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush because it cleans your teeth very good, my only drawback is that if I&#x27;m not careful I tend to touch the button and it will go to another speed and I have to start all over again. My husband loves it also.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s the same as the Diamond toothbrush with a different name, my Diamond burned out after six months so I was looking for a replacement, the dozen toothbrushes caught my eye and made the purchase, both the Diamond and the Pursonic perform quite well but there are certainly design flaws awaiting you.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat disappointed in this product. For many years I used a Sonic Care toothbrush - this Pursonic is not as powerful and while brushing it hesitates throughout the brushing process each time I use it. I guess I&#x27;m stuck with it now, at least for a while - but I am not sure how long it will last. Its been 8 months and my Pursonic is not working at all.</li>
    <li> I have one for myself I liked it so much I bought one for my husband.  The Pursonic does a great job cleaning my teeth.  My dentist even make a remark how clean they are.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This worked for 6 months.  Then it would shut off while we were brushing our teeth.  Sometimes we could turn it back on for a minute or two more, most the time it was just dead.  Also, the &#x27;silver&#x27; finish of the handle started peeling off.  I called Pursonic and was told that if I sent the handle plus $10 they would see if they could fix it; if I sent $25 I could buy a whole new one (which would last 6 months?!? No thanks!)  Not spending good money after bad!  They also told me that the handle should NOT sit in the charger all the time (which it appears to be designed for and which the instructions make no mention of).  They inferred that the problem was probably the battery losing its life from constant charging.  This is a cheaply made product. We won&#x27;t be spending any money to replace it -- we&#x27;re going to look for a better product that will last (at least as long as the toothbrush heads! ;)</li>
    <li> I am a long time Sonicare user and was excited to find this toothbrush since the Sonicare replacement heads get to be fairly expensive and this came with 12 heads and a UV sanitizer.  I have now received two non-working units.  The first one I received, the charging light would not come on.  After sending it back and getting a replacement unit, the handle would not charge!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever received any defective product 2 out of 2 times, but I&#x27;m giving up on this cheap piece of junk!!  In retrospect, I will stick with Sonicare because although they are a bit more pricey, they work for a very long time.  This one wouldn&#x27;t even work brand new out of the box...twice!</li>
    <li> Purchased on June 2012 and the switch began going toast November 2014. I purchased another identical because it is a no-brainner to include 12 toothbrushes to sweeten the deal. The UV sanitize compartment allows me to keep my brush away from bathroom airborne horror stories since the airing of the mythbusters episode on fecal deposits on, you guessed it, the toothbrushes. Thus, after 31 months without purchasing additional toothbrushes I am ready for a new toothbrush purchase. In passing, the total price is $1.61 per month. I told you it was a no-brainner.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for my wife and I, and we love them. My wife&#x27;s stopped working after about 4 months so I emailed customer service and they were very prompt in responding and getting us a new one. Very easy to work with and a great product!</li>
    <li> Very happy, we went back and purchased a second one to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush!!! I use it everyday and love it more and more. The ultra violet cleaning makes me feel like I&#x27;m using a brand new toothbrush every day! A must have!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the end of June (2014), received it in July. Shortly after using it the handle started peeling &amp; metal particles were in your hand &amp; the sink. Ok I could deal with that. However within 5 month it stopped working in the middle of brushing your teeth... Believe me I sure wish it was still working, when it was working I loved it but VERY UN-HAPPY that it didn&#x27;t last but 5 months. :(</li>
    <li> gave as a xmas gift.  daughter and son in law think its great.  both th</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby who enjoyed using my sonic toothbrush (using a different head, of course), and he loves it.  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> Four months into using this model, it began having intermittent problems; shutting off in mid-cycle, not powering on after running a full cycle, not powering on after a full day&#x27;s charge.  FYI, &amp;#34;limited warranty&amp;#34; means sending a $10 check for any repairs OR replacement.</li>
    <li> easy to use, best electric tooth brush  have ever used.Timer freature is very convient . I love it sense I bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these - one each for me and my husband and one for our son, 26. The reviews seemed mixed but more favorable than not; it was at a good price and I loved the extra heads included and the UV sanitizer. My son gave it a good endorsement, calling it a &#x27;solid&#x27; brush. This was the first electric toothbrush I have used, so I had to get used to the experience. After just a few days I was amazed how much cleaner my teeth were than with a manual brush! We all love this brush; it holds a charge well, gives a consistent good job, and I like the feature that pauses it if you press too hard. I also like the variable speeds from which to choose. I would certainly recommend the brush.</li>
    <li> Total Junk, I had one and should have learned my lesson when it stopped working shortly after purchasing.  So I thought it was just bad luck and bought another one, which stopped working after 2 months.  Called customer service and they will replace it if I pay to ship it back to them  and also pay for them to ship it back to me, even though it is under warranty.  The toothbrush base just stops working for no apparent reason.  Would not ever purchase again nor recommend this product.</li>
    <li> With this toothbrush you know that your teeth are clean, mouth feels great after brushing I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I walk away with teeth feeling cleaner than a cleaning at the dentist!  Buy with confidence because it&#x27;s definitely my favorite product purchase of this year and we have half the year to go!</li>
    <li> Right out of the box I had issues with this brush. After charging it for several hours, I couldn&#x27;t even get it to start. I had to keep pressing the power button and after what seemed like the 15th time it started. I used it for several more days ad still had the issue with it not starting right. It takes at lest 20+ presses of the power button before it finally starts. After about 2 weeks, I finally just sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush for this price!</li>
    <li> Works as good as any other other toothbrush we ever tried as the number of brushes received makes it even better.</li>
    <li> Great way to get super checkups at the dentist!  Cleans better than any conventional toothbrush and leaves your mouth feeling amazingly fresh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Pursonic S450 for about 3 weeks now and I am very satisfied with my purchase. A fantastic deal! When I purchased it from Amazon I got it for less than $50. It has a little weight to it and does not feel cheaply made at all. Although it does feel like it&#x27;s made of mostly plastic but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. This is my first electric toothbrush so it took a few brushes for me to get use to it and I really can&#x27;t compare it to the higher end Sonic toothbrushes. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the negative things I&#x27;ve read in some of the reviews. I like the covered storage compartment and the fact that it has a lift out tray and if the ultra violet light really does sanitize the heads, well thats a bonus to me. I turn the brush on and rinse it very well under clean tap water when I&#x27;m done brushing. The instruction pamphlet states the handle is waterproof and recommends cleaning under running water which is what I do. Then I wipe the handle and the shaft portion of the head with a dry towel prior to placing the head in the storage compartment and close the lid to activate the light so it will sanitize. I haven&#x27;t had to take the tray out to clean it yet. No &amp;#34;gunk in the bottom of the tray.&amp;#34;  I think it was fully charged when I received it but I let it charge overnight before using it the next morning. That first brush was amazing. It really did feel like I just got my teeth professionally cleaned but looking back now I think a small part of that may be the vibration leaves parts of your mouth a little numb and that&#x27;s related to the dental hygeinist. Maybe? The instructions says overcharging is not an issue and the charging handle can be placed in the base daily. I don&#x27;t, and haven&#x27;t had to charge it again since I got it. I use it twice a day on the gentle setting and the majority of the time I use it for 4 mins. I did get my teeth cleaned about two weeks prior to purchasing the S450 and I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are staying whiter longer compared to when I was brushing with a standard toothbrush and I find less between my teeth when I floss. I like the reminder to promote brushing in quarters and 30 seconds per quarter. I do wish it didn&#x27;t turn off after the fourth 30 seconds though. Not a con, just an inconvience. I just turn it back on. My dental hygienist has been suggesting I get a sonic toothbrush for some time but I just didn&#x27;t like the price tag of the well known name brands. Their low end models were more expensive than this one and it&#x27;s not Pursonic&#x27;s low end model. The included 3 year supply of brushes saves me money also. I&#x27;ll never go back to the traditional toothbrush. Maybe my next sonic toothbruch will be a Sonicare or Oral B, who knows, but I think at the very least the Pursonic S450 is a great way to be introduced to a sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Update 29March:&lt;br /&gt;Battery went dead on me a few days ago for the first time. There was no warning that the battery was gettting low or needed a charge. After I finished brushing and was rinsing the brush and it stopped working. After charging of course it works just fine. So fully charged it last me 5 weeks. I still love it!brushing with a standard toothbrush and I find less between my teeth when I floss.

    <li> My roommate and I both LOVE this toothbrush. I had to replace one I bought several years ago and just couldn&#x27;t go back to a manual toothbrush full time. This one is identical to the one I bought previously (under a different brand name), but this one came with a three year supply of brush heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line... my teeth feel amazing after each use!</li>
    <li> Great sonic toothbrush.  I have wanted to upgrade for awhile and this was a great deal.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this product daily for the last six months, but it stopped working. We like the toothbrush, but we&#x27;re very disappointed that it no longer works.</li>
    <li> My uv light bulb never worked and now I don&#x27;t have the sanitizer feature...and I&#x27;ve searched for a replacement bulb can&#x27;t find one anywhere!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it arrived promptly. The item worked for approximately one week, then stopped. The light on the toothbrush itself turned on like it was operating normally, but would not operate. I sent this item back to the seller with an explanation, per warranty guidelines. Hopefully I will get a replacement soon. Prior to it malfunctioning, it worked great.</li>
    <li> This is a scam. The blue light bulb which supposedly sanitizes the brushes does not work. I have called 4 times to get a replacement bulb. They always promise but don&#x27;t send it. They are scammers.  The toothbrush itself is OK.. but a regular one from the drug store is just as good. A waste of money.</li>
