<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My friend suggested the Robocut idea in the year 2000 and also demonstrated it to my family at his home. We liked it so much that we purchased one right away and have been using it since then. My wife uses it to cut my hair and hair of my two sons every couple of weeks. She tells me that it is so easy to use. We must have saved at least $7000 in the last 13 years. We do not look for coupons of hair salon for our hair cuts any more. I tell this to all my friends. It is so easy to use. we have not gone to hair salon for the  last 13 years.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, my sons did not like it when they went first time for their hair cut in a salon 13 years ago and then we bought this robocut and they have never gone to a hair salon. I recommend this to every one. Apart from cost savings, you save so much of your time in going to a salon and waiting there in line for your number to come for hair cut.  The robocut does not make any mess on floor as all hair goes in the  Vacuume. We use one standard adapter for all our haircuts. The blade worked for 9 years and then it became dull and we bought a new one at a price of $15 in 2009. It was very easy to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Attaching a  vaccume cleaner is not a problem. It is very easy. But the newer Robocut one that comes with a vacuume and must be much better. I plan to purchase that one soon.  Compared to  savings over the years, the cost of this unit is nothing.</li>
    <li> My mother wanted a simple summer cut and wanted to borrow my Flowbee. I had the Flowbee several years ago and it did an ok job. Think I gave it away a long time ago. Thought we could try out the Robocut and then let her take it home so she could do it herself.&lt;br /&gt;Noisier, designed with a hole in vacuum tube for electric cord, so less suction, adapter extenders do not &amp;#34;screw on&amp;#34; or fit on the robocut or atop other adapters. Put both 2 inch adapters together and taped it to the robocut because did not want hair cut  2 inches long. Not enough suction (using a Dyson), so taped the hole shut.&lt;br /&gt;Had to bounce it on the head to get the hair to enter the cutter. After 15 minutes, it was a choppy mess. Took it down to a single two inch adapter and started again. After 5 more minutes of the bounce method, it was as good as it would get. Not cut evenly, but better. Measured the hair and it was about 1 !/2 inches long. Maybe the 2 inch AND one of the other adapters would add up to 2 inch hair. But they do not fit together unless you tape them.&lt;br /&gt;What a mess. Definitely not something my mother could do for herself.  And the hairstyle looks like..... there is no style.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it for buzz cuts, it would probably work.&lt;br /&gt;Also says you can groom animals, Could work on short fur,  if they will put up with the motor noise and vacuum noise.</li>
    <li> I bought a Robocut with vacuum. Used it twice. First time I had a full head of hair and wanted a trim. I chalked it up to inexperience. Now my hair is short and I wanted to trim it off the ears. I found that even after oiling it. I had to oil it 4x after the first. The handle got hot and it didn&#x27;t cut much. I had to lift the hair and trim it with the robocut. I am not impressed with it.</li>
    <li> Pros: Light weight; easy to hold; better than Flowbee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: loud; does not fit all vacums (I have 3 different vacums and Robocut does not fit neither. I had to use duct tape to modify; Design of adjustable adapter is bad. It can easily move as you are using it if you are not careful. This will result is shorter uneven haircut; Haircuts take longer as expected and require multiple retakes to insure even cut.</li>
    <li> I bought a Robocut about 9 years ago and it worked great.  I used it to cut my hair and my son&#x27;s for roughly 8 years.  Probably saved several hundred dollars on haircuts.  It cut quickly and accurately.  When that Robocut gave up the ghost, I ordered a new one.  Big mistake.  They obviously changed the design and now get their blades from some cheaper, low quality supplier.  The new model constantly pulls out your hair while cutting.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how little you take off.  The blades are so poorly made that they do not consistently cut and end up yanking hair out.  My poor son cried through his haircut with the new model.  I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it was until I cut my own hair with it.  Too bad that a once great product has become such a poor one.  I&#x27;ll be trying the Flowbee now, I guess.</li>
    <li> First, the Robocut does a nice haircut... when it&#x27;s new. I loved the first one which lasted maybe a year. When it finally started snagging my hair and pulling out strands I bought a replacement that lasted a little less than a year. Bought a third one that did two haircuts before it started pulling hair out and stalling the blades. I finally bought a Flowbee and it has worked perfect for a year. Don&#x27;t waste your time on the Robocut... it sounds better in concept than in action.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about 14 years ago after seeing an infomercial.  I am Happy to say, it has worked great for the last 14 years.  I use it ever 3 weeks, and figure I have saved about $2700.  over the last 14 years.  More importantly, I have gotten so good with this, that the haircuts I give myself look 10x better than any salon!!!  I had gone to get my haircut a couple of times over the years, and they just don&#x27;t do as good a job, it doesn&#x27;t look as good. It could be because after all these years I have it down to a science, but my Robocut looks better.  I have never changes the blades, I think its getting to the point that I should, and I have never had any problem with the unit.  I use 3 drops of oil on blade before use...thats it.  Works great for me.  By the way I have a standard manual model, iif mine ever stops I might try the newer automatic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about three years and by and large it&#x27;s done a fairly decent job, however; the more I use it the more the guides slip causing gouges in your hair.  I don&#x27;t like the design of it and now will buy a flobee.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest tool for grooming dogs.  I have cut my Pomeranian and Shih Tsu several times over the last month and it works like a champ. The cut is much more even than when using scissors and cleanup is practically non-existent.  I highly recommend this for all those do-it-yourselfers!</li>
    <li> UPDATE (September 2016):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many years of using both devices, we burned out both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So which device did we end up buying again? The Flowbee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still agree with my original 4-star assessment of the Robocut. Both are good devices. But from now on, I&#x27;m sticking with Flowbee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deciding factors for me were: (1) Flowbee doesn&#x27;t pull hair as much as the Robocut (especially when using on children). I do like those rotary blades, but it&#x27;s unavoidable, they will get dull &amp; start pulling hair, unless you replace them frequently. (2) I like the larger rectangle head of the Flowbee (seems to cover more area, get it done quicker...again, especially when using on children). (3) I like the little vacuum that comes with the Flowbee. I was skeptical at first, but it&#x27;s worth it. And, (4) Flowbee motor seems to last a little bit longer and required less maintenance than Robocut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the Robocut still has some distinct advantages. It&#x27;s a bit quieter. It&#x27;s easier to replace parts. The attachments/extensions are better built &amp; stay on better. And because of the smaller circular cut area, you do get a better, variegated final result (Flowbee takes a little more practice). Nonetheless, I&#x27;m sticking with Flowbee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note: Amazon&#x27;s price is often higher than ordering direct from the manufacturer web sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review (from 2010):&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Our family has been cutting our own hair (and dog/cats) for many years. It&#x27;s not just saving money - it&#x27;s the time and hassle to drag yourself (or your kids) to the salon. I&#x27;m hoping this information will help you make a decision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the different systems we&#x27;ve tried work just fine, and you can find lots of helpful tips on Youtube. If you&#x27;re trying to save money on a barber, pet groomer, or on kids hair cuts, there are many options (high-end clippers, clippers with built-in vac, Robocut, Flowbee, Aircut, etc) - you basically can&#x27;t go wrong &amp; you&#x27;ll definitely save time &amp; money! And, they&#x27;re all available on Amazon (many have free shipping), so I say, DO IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, some of my friends were *shocked* to find out I cut my own hair. One of my good friends still doesn&#x27;t believe me!...I suppose because I always keep a very professional looking hair cut. The last hair cut I paid for was $65 + tip at a salon (needed a PR photo) ...and it was not as nice as I can do myself. So I said, I&#x27;ll never again pay for a hair cut. We have used many different systems, &amp; here&#x27;s some advantages of the Robocut:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Flowbee uses vibrational blades, like some men&#x27;s electric razor (the Robocut uses a rotating/circular blade). When it&#x27;s brand new, the Flowbee&#x27;s vibrational blade will work faster. But the vibrational blades will also break more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Flowbee uses square adapters (Robocut is round) - so, in combination with the vibrational blades, you&#x27;re more likely to get a &amp;#34;bowl cut&amp;#34; (Solution: Use two different lengths on the same section of hair, and go from different directions, to achieve a variegated look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Robocut uses round adapters, and a round blade which simulates a hair cut with a straight razor. The result is, easier to do a tapered cut, &amp; a more variegated look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some models of the Robocut come with a free neck/hairline cutting tool (for men&#x27;s cuts &amp; short hair). This is basically worthless. If you are cutting your own hair, I strongly recommend you get someone else to cut your neckline. I&#x27;ve been cutting hair (my own &amp; others) for many years, and no matter how good I am, it does not look like a professional cut unless the neckline is nice &amp; trim (that is, for men ...women should not shave their neckline, it creates stubble and looks masculine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The most common complaint about Robocut (in Amazon reviews &amp; elsewhere) is pulling hair. It&#x27;s unavoidable on both devices, but if you oilthe blade really well (before AND after each use), then it will prolong the life of the blades, and help cut smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Clean out the blade periodically of any hair debris (a Q-tip works nicely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Our first Robocut died after about 4 years. It probably would have lasted longer, but I didn&#x27;t follow my own advice! Several times, after cutting the hair of our hyper puppy, I didn&#x27;t take the time to oil and clean the blade, and the motor burned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You can remove the blade easily (just 4 screws) and sharpen it yourself. Also, replacement blades are inexpensive &amp; easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My replacement Robocut died within a year. The company immediately sent me a replacement, no hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your money &amp; time-saving venture! No hair cutting system is perfect, and they all work just fine (some better than others). And no matter which system you chose, it takes a few tries to get good at it. So, jump in right now! Try one of the products I mentioned, and it will save you money even if you only use it a few times! Cutting hair will quickly become 2nd nature to you. If you screw up badly, let a salon fix it for you, &amp; try again next month. You can&#x27;t go wrong.any hair debris (a Q-tip works nicely).  - Our first Robocut died after about 4 years.

    <li> Motor burnt while cutting his hair the first time we did it. Product stinks.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too happy with this product. I oiled the blades religiously, but they took an average of an hour to cut my hair and lasted a maximum of 5 haircuts before needing to be replaced. Some of the replacement blades I ordered didn&#x27;t work well from the start, and pulled so much on the hairs that it became too painful to use. The plastic case of the cutter (at the end where the blade is held) also quickly started to crack. The motor wore out after only 4 uses, right while I was in the middle of a haircut, and I had to go to a barber to finish the job. Customer service was friendly and they sent me free replacement parts, but in the end I preferred getting a traditional hair clipper and sticking to simple crew-cuts. The 10 haircuts I got out of my Robocut (before it finally fell apart) were cheaper than going to a barber, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was tired of paying 90 bucks to my vet for a trim for my cat.  The product works fine but I cant say the cat looks so great.  I had to brush my cat with one hand and use the trimmer with the other - otherwise he would run away scared.  Dont forget to use the oil that comes with it to keep the blades sharp!</li>
    <li> I purchased a Robocut about 20 years ago.  I cut my own hair with it because I figure, why pay someone $12 - $15, plus tip, for a mediocre haircut when I can give myself a decent cut virtually free?  I use it every few months and have saved the cost of the unit many, many times over.  If my old unit ever breaks down, I&#x27;ll buy another one for sure.  For new users, be sure to oil it every time you use it.  I apply a couple of drops of clipper oil to the center of the cutting blade two or three times per haircut.  The oil can be purchased from any salon supply store and one bottle lasts a long time -- so be sure to use it!  Ever since the beginning, however, I have noticed that the sliding hair guide has a tendency to slip.  I fixed that by wrapping a rubber band around the nozzle so that the guide rests against it for extra support.  Seems to work.  I just have to roll the band up or down when I want to change the length.  No problem.</li>
    <li> Since I bought a Flowbee years ago, I have something with which to compare it, and the RoboCut cannot compare.  First of all, I don&#x27;t understand the circular design.  When you section hair, you usually section in rows that are rectangular in shape, so this makes sectioning the hair much more difficult and time consuming. The blades seemed dull. I think it is important to note that my hair is super fine, and a hairdresser once told me she hardly had to move her scissors, that my hair cut so easily.  Next, I washed &amp; dried my hair immediately before using the RoboCut and didn&#x27;t use any thickeners, hair sprays, etc. It was totally clean &amp; should have cut with ease.  Not so!  I had to move the thing up &amp; down ad nauseum to get it to cut, and even then, the ends weren&#x27;t cut straight across as they would have been with a Flowbee, and I fed very little hair to the cutters. I may as well have been using a Weedeater! It couldn&#x27;t even handle 1/2\\&quot; at a time.  Also, I simply cannot understand the hole in the hose that is meant to be there, as it decreases the vacuum&#x27;s suction power a LOT.  I held my thumb over it, and then the hair went to the blades much better.  This has to be the wimpiest haircutter on the market, and I don&#x27;t see how they sell them.  Their return rate has to be very high, and I am returning mine for a refund.  I bought it because it was a lot less expensive than the Flowbee. Too bad I had to give it even one star.</li>
    <li> I stay in South Africa and a friend of mine has a Flow Bee. I was very impressed by the concept of not getting messed up with loose hair while getting a haircut. I checked the internet and saw the Robocut and accoarding to some comparison it was rated better than the Flow Bee. My first disappointment was that it uses 120 volt and not 220 volt. So I had to purchase an other powersupply. Then I realised that the fittings for the Robocutter are round and not square, so you don&#x27;t get the neat cut along the side of your head. It was noisy, didn&#x27;t cut the hair even and after using it for a few minutes the Robocut started to overheat...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said ...  the worst buy ever! Rather buy the Flow Bee. I will.</li>
    <li> Product worked great at first. Motor wont spin after 3 uses. To top it off I missed the return window by 2 days.</li>
    <li> I am a guy and I had fairly long hair - about six inches.  I didn&#x27;t cut it very often and when I do I often have it cut very short, mainly because I don&#x27;t like going to hair cutting places.  But I figured there had to be a way to do it myself when I wanted a simple haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looked interesting as it was much cheaper than the FlowBee - I fgured it would be a simple matter - just set it for 1/2 inch next to the scalp and this think would take care of it.  Boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like it has the blade of a meat grinder instead of a haircutter - it has holes like a meat grinder and it rotates - a little faster but not that fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could barely tell it was cutting - it took forever and was nothing like even.  I ended up getting an electric clipper out that I had originally bought before I bought Robocut and intended to send back.  The clipper worked - RoboCut didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars ONLY because I was going from quite long to short and maybe that was too much to expect from this thing - but still if it can cut dogs hair supposedly - mine wasn;t anywhere near that thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the poor reviews serious.  This thing is severly under powered and badly designed in my opinion. For $60 to $70 - would it be so tough to actually come up with something that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a toy and has a real 110 motor (this thing uses an adaptor to reduce current in 12 volt or something).</li>
    <li> Nice quiet operation with smooth hair cutting. Easy to change hair lengths to give an even and professional look to your haircut.</li>
    <li> I bought a robocut in 1997.  I&#x27;m still using it today.  It cost around $80.  That&#x27;s 16 years of monthly haircuts for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming monthly haircuts, that&#x27;s 16 * 12 &#x3D; 192 haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The robocut takes around 30 minutes to use, including cleanup time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cheap barber costs around $20 plus around 30 minutes round trip driving, plus around 45 minutes waiting and sitting in the chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, cost &#x3D; $80 + 96 hours for the robocut.  A barber would have cost almost $3840 + 240 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve oiled mine before every use, and it still works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve also used it once or twice on the dog.  It worked fine, but I think he still bears the psychological scars.</li>
    <li> LOW QUALITY, USELESS HAIR TRIMMER..&lt;br /&gt;IT IS HARD TO USE AND NOT GETTING&lt;br /&gt;THE RESULTS THEY CLAIM..&lt;br /&gt;***NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT***</li>
    <li> i tried to use it once so far and believe once i learn how to work it properly it will be beneficial to me and save me money</li>
    <li> We own two Robocut haircutting machines. We love them. They have saved us thousands of dollars. Convenient, quick, effective, ready to go when I am ready and they work extremely well. My two brothers turned me on to haircutting at home, easy cleanup with the vacuum cleaner and effective cutting hair, about 10 years ago. Have not been to a haircutting establishment since then. They are fun to use and the results are as good if not better than professionals. A friend also purchased this machine after we told him about our wonderful experience with the machine and the company and the people at the company. First use one could immediately see the savings - time, travel, convenience, finance. Like us he cuts his hair about every 2 to 4 weeks and it looks professional. These are great machines, they make great gifts, and they are a wonderful investment that will give returns every time you use it. We spent 35 years in military and many solders and former military use this product, because it gets great results, the cleanup is virtually nothing and it is easy to use. One could almost say this is idiot proof from the get-go.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my 4th Robocut in the mail today and it is totally defective. I bought my 1st one 20 years ago and it lasted till last year---a great product. But like most products these days, Robo started having them made \\&quot;overseas\\&quot; sometime after I bought the 1st one. This is the 3rd one in the past year. Usually I can get 4-5 haircuts out of one but apparently no longer! I&#x27;m such a sucker for it because it&#x27;s a great concept and no one else makes one like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/7/12  The owner/inventor of Robocut called me after seeing this review. He was extremely nice and explained that they had had some production problems about that time. He also explained that each unit has a two year unconditional warranty---no questions asked. I was very impressed with his honesty and candor. A week later two new Robocut systems arrived in the mail to replace the ones that had broken. In light of the great warranty and service, I can now recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I have owned both of these products and used them for years.  I never experienced any failures with the Flowbee system.  I tried the Robocut because the mini-vac used with the Flowbee was SO loud.  But after using the Robocut for two years now I have had two major failures.  The first motor stopped working and they replaced it with minimal trouble.  Recently the plastic frame that hold the motor on the second unit failed leaving the unit worthless.  I tried using parts from the original unit and the plastic on it broke.  So, I am left with the need to buy another one, and it will not be a Robocut.</li>
    <li> I just ordered straight from the Robocut website, found a VERY nice discount for returning customers.  Prices here are too high, ($73 compared to $45) go to the manufacturers site and get the best deal available.  The new model has a universal voltage transformer on it, this thing will be in our luggage for an extended stay in other countries.  Great haircuts repeatedly and by staying home to get one the cost savings are fantastic.  Plus, the control on HOW I want the cut to look is unmatchable.  Bought the first one in 2003, the transformer just went out, but the original blades were still in place and cutting fine.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had the older RoboCut for about 10 years now. Ordered one after the barber I went to used something like it.  It works great.  Then I started using it on our pets and couldn&#x27;t get along without it. One pet has straight medium length hair and one has shortish curly poodle hair that you can&#x27;t get a clipper with a guard through. The RoboCut provides a better looking cut than clippers anyway with some scissor touchups.  With her tight fur, it did hang and strip some small nylon gears but the company has always been more than helpful in supplying any spare parts at a small price for the internal repair I did myself. Now I see the Red unit has metal gears so that won&#x27;t happen again, just be ready to unplug if it hangs. The best human and/or pet product I have ever purchased. Have saved well over a thousand dollars on human and pet haircuts over the years. I would still be ahead if I had to purchase several. I am surprised mine is still working as much as it has been used, I did also replaced the cutting blade once.  As with everything you have to use care &amp; common since and practice when using it and follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> If you are not particular about your hair cut,this machine really works. Someone does have to do some light trimming around the ears and back. Robocut pays for itself after three or four haircuts.</li>
    <li> I have been using one of these for a few years now. It takes a little getting used to, but going to a barber, for me anyway,is an unpleasant experience. Write down the settings you use on paper and leave it with the unit. Then you don&#x27;t have to remember each time you use it. Men still have to trim around the ears a little with scissors, but once you get used to it, it becomes a favorite tool.  You don&#x27;t get the manicured and neat cut of a professional barber, so if you like your stylist stay with them, but for me it is just fine.  I think this is a wonderful invention.</li>
    <li> I decided to keep my hair trimmed shorter and therefore it needed to be more frequently cut - so I decided to try and do it myself. Since my hair is thin on top, my technique is to use regular hair trimmers for the sides and back (1/2\\&quot; depth) and the Robocut for the top. I&#x27;ve used the Robocut twice now and feel that it offers marginal use with the following highlights:  * Since Robocut depends on vacuum pressure to lift the hair, you have to keep going back and forth to get all the hair cut.   * I cut my thin hair on top to under 2\\&quot; and it seems to work OK for that  * If you have thick hair, it will take a long time to cut it all     * If you are cutting hair to 1\\&quot; length or less, regular trimmers w/depth guide works better</li>
    <li> Back in the 1980&#x27;s I saw an informercial for the Flowbee, an electrically powered vacuum attachment made for cutting hair.  And for the cost of a few haircuts, I got a tool that enabled me to give others and myself a decent haircut.    The device attached to the suction hose of a vacuum cleaner and the suction stands the hair up and allows the device to cut the hair in a clean and even manner.  One set of attachments allowed the hair to be cut at specific lengths and another allowed the sides to be cut in an even taper.    The secret behind the success of this device is simple:  when all of the hair on a person&#x27;s head is cut to the same length, the resulting haircut almost always looks pretty good on anybody.    When my son was small, this device saved us a considerable amount of money and countless hours of dragging him back and forth to barber shops.      The problem with the Flowbee was that after a certain amount of use, the blades got dull.  Then the device didn&#x27;t work as well as it had before. It tened to pull and to chop at the hair. The kids stopped looking forward to getting haircuts.  I looked around, but couldn&#x27;t find a replacement Flowbee anywhere.  So eventually the Flowbee went to Goodwill and we went back to SuperCuts.    *  *  *  *  *  *    Fast foward to this year: my son is now in his early 20&#x27;s and paying for his haircuts out of his own pocket money.  So one day he asks about the old Flowbee and can we get another one.      So I search the Internets and learn that they say there are Flowbees around but  the retailers are all out of stock.      But then I discover there&#x27;s another product, the Robocut, another vacuum powered haircut device, but the Robocut has replaceable blades.    So we order a Robocut.  It arrives in a reasonable time.      We attach it to our shop vac with a universal tool adapter and some duct tape, plug in both devices and give it a try.    Any vacuum with a hose works just fine    The robocut has a sliding adjustment for thelength of the cut as opposed to the flowbee&#x27;s plastic spacers of different lengths. This is a bit easier to use than the flowbee&#x27;s spacers but either way you have to pay attention to the cut length during the process of cutting.    !! (I get the basic model WITHOUT the attached vacuum and just use my husband&#x27;s shop vac, which has VERY good suction.) And this time I will take better care of it and oil it before every use!    The results are incredible.  After reading the manual and a little practice, we get haircuts that are entirely satisfactory.    Our haircuts invariably draw positive feedback from a few of the women that we encounter in the course of our day.      But the best part is that after a few haircuts, the Robocut pays for itself.    It is a big relief that one no longer has to pay twenty dollars to a barber or stylist who does not listen to whatever you say, and one is not obligated to tip him or her a few bucks for the privilege of doing so.    So if you are tired paying too much for mediocre haircuts, or if you have a kid who needs a haircut now and then, definitely consider the Robocut.</li>
    <li> I have used both the flowbee and robocut, and can say without hesitation, do not buy the robocut!  I used it about 3 times and even with my short hair the thing was pulling and ripping out hair. Not to mention the cheap plastic \\&quot;guide\\&quot; that kept slipping. A true piece of junk! The flowbee is far superior, I have had mine for about 7 years w/o problem. The only exception being a broken spacer.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product while it worked. After 2 years it started painfully pulling clumps of my hair out.  Ouch! I&#x27;ll try the Flowbee now. Too bad, it was great while it lasted.</li>
    <li> not ever cut hair ,looking at nothing move to cut hair ,</li>
    <li> Dear RoboCut,  I read some comments on your product and wanted to submit my own to you.  My husband and I moved to a very rural community with very little luck of finding a good hairdresser.  I knew about the FlowBee and decided to research and that is when I found the RoboCut.  I looked at the different options on both and decided on yours.  We have been using it for the last three years now and for as long as you offer supplies and your product, we will always us it.  We even bought a little vacumm cleaner just for our RoboCut.  It works great and so convenient to cut our hair when we need or want it cut.  We&#x27;ve paid for it over serveral times now over the years as compaired to a regular hairdresser charges.  Is a must have for the self-sufficient type and who wants to save money.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get easier. Well, it does, but if you&#x27;re tired of paying big money for inconsistent haircuts, Robocut puts the control in your hands for the price of three bad barber cuts. Read the skimpy instruction manual, plug it in, oil it up and just do as the book says. The cool part for the timid is that you can dial it in in extremely small increments. Take your time and get the results you have asked for for years but never got. Look like YOU want to look, not like some stranger thinks you should look. I love it even though I&#x27;m still learning and dialing in. The inventor of this thing needs a Nobel Prize in Something. Did I say I love this thing?</li>
    <li> Plugged it in and didn&#x27;t work. There were small short pieces of black hair throughout the container. Will try for a refund.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a hair cutter that would be easy to use, and was looking at the Flowbee at first.  Then I saw a YouTube video on the Robocutter and decided to buy that one instead. The deciding factor for me was the ease in changing the blades. I have cut both my hair and my husbands hair exclusively for over 3 years now and still like it.  At $25 a haircut, I&#x27;ve saved us the cost of the machine several times over.  I bought the one with its own vacuum, which is very powerful. I cut our hair every month or so, and have replaced the blades about once a year.  I am very happy with my Robocutter with vacuum. My only gripe is that is unwieldy to store. The individual blades are easy to buy on line and were shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> I bought the robocut and not only does it not work well, it quit working after 2 uses. The thing just feels cheap and turns out... it is.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t Cut my hair, pulls hair out half the time. Oiled blades but no change. Don&#x27;t buy this cheap plastic. Case.</li>
    <li> I am buying a second one for my other home so I do not have to take it with me. I use it to cut my poodles hair, I have saved tons of money in just the one year I have had it. In addition to the savings of not needing to take her to the groomers and pick  her up..all the gas and time involved. It takes about ten minutes to do then we shampoo and she looks great and she loves it. I did read the directions and I oil it faithfully so I hope it lasts a long time but I will say I have definitely gotten my moneys worth and I would not hesitate to buy another if needed.[[ASIN:B001U1HI5I Robocut Model-r28 Vacuum Haircutter, Red]]</li>
    <li> Since I retired I just rebelled at the prices of a simple haircut so I bought the RoboCut pro model. It Cuts my hair superbly but finally died. Checked on the warranty - - guess what it made it only for a month after the warranty expired - cutter head motor locked up. Think I&#x27;ll try the FlowBee now.</li>
    <li> I used to have a flobee and loved it.. Went to buy a new one, and got this instead to save a few bucks.  Big mistake.  It looses suction somehow, so that even though I have a strong vacuum, not enough suction remains at the end of the device to suck the hair in properly.  Also, the rotary blade doesnt cut well.. On the flowbee it has blades that go back and forth.  Im so sorry I tried to save a few bucks with this junk.</li>
    <li> I bought a Flobee when the came out.  Myself and 4 boys haircuts for about 9 years before the Flobee housing cracked.  Replaced it with a Robocut.  It lasted about 5 years before case broke, and bought another Robocut.  Lasted about 5 years, tubing cracked from oil on cutting blade and then housing cracked.  I am purchacing another Flobee from other site (due to cost).  Flobee is better made, but I prefer the handling of the Robocut, despite less durability. About $10/year for either  the Flobee or Robocut, I made my decision on the one made in the United States, since the Flobee factory is in Texas.</li>
    <li> Important: I oil the blades before starting, &amp; 1/2 way through (~2-3 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;If you hear the blades slowing down it needs to be oiled again so they don&#x27;t overheat which will compromise the plastic, damage the blade temper/edge and become dull.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the RoboCut since I ordered it from Popular Science about 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Works excellent on my hair, my 2 sons, friends and the wife on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;I started with the original white plastic version in ~1987? but after using some synthetic Teflon oil (mistake: NOT clipper oil) the oil caused the plastic to crack around the blades so I bought the newer red plastic model after ~10-15 years or so, which has been working excellent since. I have also never replaced the blades.&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair more often (every 2-3 weeks) since it only takes ~5 minutes, but if you count $20-$25 every 6 weeks for the hair cuts over ~20 years it&#x27;s saved me over $10,000 sor far and counting. A frend has used the Flowbee for about 15-20 years too but I think it takes too long ~10-15+ minutes and having to do the Flowbee up and down motion is a pain compared to the faster sliding motion of the RoboCut (like using an electric shaver on your face).&lt;br /&gt;One RoboCut downside is: if you have very thin hair or try to cut too much or use dull blades it could pull you hair a little. My sons have complained it pulls their hair if I cut too much, or move too fast; but over their 19 years of haircuts I&#x27;ve had few complaints so that&#x27;s not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Being an Engineer it looks to me the folks that complained about the RoboCut either had very thin hair, didn&#x27;t lubricate the blades frequently: causing the blades to dull, motor &amp; plastic to overheat, or used an aggressive oil instead of \\&quot;Clipper Oil\\&quot; which causes the plastic to crack.&lt;br /&gt;I thought about buying a Flowbee but after reading all the complaints on both the Flowbee and RoboCut I&#x27;ll stick with the RoboCut.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for about 4 years before it stripped the plastic gears in the gear box.  The new ones say they have metal gears.  I ordered a new one, but from robocut.com as they have a special on them at $49 with free shipping 4-30-12.</li>
    <li> The Robocut works as advertised.  It is pretty simple to give oneself or another person a neat haircut, with no hair going down the neck to itch and irritate.</li>
    <li> I got it for my personnel use, was sure if it was going to be that ez to use. but it is.</li>
    <li> The Robocut itself does a good haircut, and when I pointed out that the product was shipped incomplete, the order was made right in a very quick manner.</li>
    <li> I have used the Robocut haircutting system for several years and have been very satisfied. The speed, lack of mess, and quality of the haircut is just great. It can pay for itself in no time and if you want to give youself a trim at 3AM - well, I think there&#x27;s therapy for that - but you can still do it. Great product and very good customer service.</li>
    <li> This is my second Robocut.  I bought the first one 5 or 10 years ago, used it every 2 weeks.  I don&#x27;t figure it owes me anything!  I re-read the instructions while trying to revive the last one --discovered I&#x27;d been abusing it while applying oil (ran it more than 5 seconds).&lt;br /&gt;  I like the convenience of cutting my hair at home.  It saves a lot of time --so I cut my hair more often --often enough that folks still recognize me after a haircut  ;)  The vacuum feature leaves me a lot cleaner than a barber-shop cut does; and, it eliminates cleaning floor when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
    <li> I had a Flowbee for years, but the price for the same thing keeps going up and up. I thought I&#x27;d try this Robocut unit for half the price. I have only cut my hair once so far, but it works great! Fast, reasonably quiet (quieter then the Flowbee) first couple of inches of adjustment is the tube that slides up and down....easy.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Robocut and it&#x27;s is easy to get a good haircut with it. The quality of the machine leaves a lot to be desired. the one i just bought, the motor quit and I&#x27;m going to return it and hope for the best with the next one.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair cutting product! I have had mine for over 25 years and have never had a problem with it. It&#x27;s like the Energizer bunny; it just keeps going and going...In that period of time I think I have replaced the blades only 5 or 6 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done a lot of rather frugal traveling and I would always take my Robocut and a small vacuum along. I would just search out available outlets whenever I needed a \\&quot;cut.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish most other products I have would turn out to be this durable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $99 for mine back then and have many times been thankful for the money, time and hassle it has saved me through those years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Robocut!</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Robocut product three times in the past, as the  motor wears out. However, this is an \\&quot;Updated\\&quot; version. More lightweight and cheesey. It heats up and stops cutting almost out of the box. While one may  expect to replace the product after some use, it is not worth even buying extra blades with this update. Flowbee is much better made and fine for shorter hair, but I do prefer the Robocut system for longer hair, just forget about quality of construction with this model, which used to be much better made. There is as heavier duty model that does not require use of a vacuum cleaner for suction, but it would have been better if this version was heavier duty, even at slightly higher price point. Also, both Flowbee and Robocut have boxes that are too small to contain the product easily for storage and reuse after opening. The cost cutting has affected product quality with Robocut particularly.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I started with the Flowbee. The only problem I had with the Flowbee was using the rubber sleeve to attach it to the vacuum. When it died I tried a Robocut on the recommendation of the distributor, and it fits the vacuum perfectly without an adapter. The smaller head also concentrates the vacuum suction, lifting better. That machine was damaged in a move, so I went to the r28, which has a better height adjustment system. I think the key to using these machines is a powerful vacuum. I have a Sanyo 12 amp vacuum. I&#x27;ve never had to replace blades, but I oil them before each use. I have thick hair, worn in what I&#x27;d call a long buzz cut, standing up about 1 1/4 inch on the top. I use the buzz cut adapter for the top and the angled adapter for the sides, moving it progressively closer. I use my beard trimmer to finish the back and sides. It takes me about ten minutes, and I&#x27;d estimate over the years this product has saved me at least $12,000 in salon costs, to say nothing of the driving, waiting in uncomfortable chairs reading six month old magazines, and hours discussing the hairdressers&#x27; problems.</li>
    <li> This package came fast. We order a new one every couple years. Saves a lot of money on our haircuts for our four kids. I even cut my own hair with it. This little gadget more than pays for it self.</li>
    <li> I bought my 1st RoboCut 8-10 years ago and it lasted years before the motor started to weaken.  I didn&#x27;t even make it through one haircut before this one start to weaken.  Sorry I bought it now, the quality is total crap.</li>
    <li> Broke first time but they gave me a full refund. Defective I think. But while it lasted it cut the hair great.</li>
    <li> Have replaced twice now. Blade keeps seizing. Followed direction&#x27;s  to the T.&lt;br /&gt;Needs oil every 2-3 minutes. The owner is a blockhead. He refuses to believe his blades have a design flaw. He thinks he&#x27;s an engineer and says the gear reduction is too powerful for the blade to jam. He obviously goes to a hair dresser.</li>
    <li> Yeah it was kind of pricey. But pays for itself in just a few uses with today&#x27;s haircut prices. It is surprisingly accurate and actually delivers a nice cut. We use it on my husband&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s just the perfect solution. Cuts well.</li>
    <li> I have used the Robocut for many years and just bought a replacement. I like the cost savings and the convenience of getting a haircut anytime day or night. This recent one came from Always Bargain, who has been very responsive in dealing with a billing issue.</li>
    <li> Received 2 of the same size taper pieces, and not the sharper angle piece that should have came with it. Parts appear thinner and cheaper than the old style I had had used for 10 years. Had to rate it lower for the missing taper piece.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first robocut in 2003 after getting a bad haircut at the barber, and I upgraded to the robocut with the built in vacuum in 2009 for the added convenience. Since 2003, I&#x27;ve only had to pay for a haircut twice due to extended periods of travel, and both times I was disappointed that the haircut wasn&#x27;t as good as what I can give myself with the robocut. I&#x27;ve used the robocut at least once a month over the past 9 years and I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with the product. I find the tapered attachment to be the most useful--I use it with a very close setting at the hairline around my ears and neck, and then gradually increase the length setting as I cut the hair closer to the top of my head--this creates a very even fade between the shorter hair on the sides and the longer hair on top. I basically just repeat that process with the same tapered attachment for the hair on the top of my head, using a shorter setting on the hair in the back and gradually making the setting longer as I move to the hair in front. I like the fact that I can cut my hair every two to three weeks--back when I was paying for haircuts I would get it cut too short and then let it grow too long in order to save money by stretching the time between haircuts--now I just take 10 to 15 minutes every few weeks and always have a haircut I&#x27;m happy with--thank you Robocut! My one piece of advice is that, if you plan on using the robocut to cut your hair very short as I do around my ears and neck, I suggest you use a vacuum that allows you to decrease the amount of vacuum when cutting short hair--when the vacuum is too high during short hair cutting, it is easy to cut your hair too short if you aren&#x27;t being careful. Besides the convenience of the built in vacuum model, the ability to reduce the level of vacuum when cutting short hair is very useful.</li>
    <li> I bought my ROBOCUT about 40 years ago, have never been to a barber since.. Have 4 kids, started using it on them 40 years ago, oldest Son now 54 and have used it on him from time to time even now.. I have never had any problems with it, I lubed and cared for it as per instructions..  Oh yes, used it to cut my Wifes hair, she always looked super, she stopped going out for her cuts... Ok here are the numbers,,,,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair once every three weeks. &#x3D;17 cuts per year @ $6.00 per cut (avg) &#x3D; $103.00  X 40 yrs.&#x3D;$4080.00.. also cut two boys hair same time..17x2&#x3D;34 cuts per year.. I cut theirs till they left home at about 18.  that is about 8 years each.. so, 17 cuts X 2 boys X 8 years @ $6.00 per cut &#x3D;$1632.00 ,,,,$4080.00&lt;br /&gt;  + $1632.00&lt;br /&gt;  &#x3D;$5712.00  I think I more than recovered $50.00 (old money) price of unit..... I still LOVE it, and still able to look good at age 78...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any family that does not own one needs to run out and get one today.... unless you shave your bean.. OH YES, it still workes the same as it did day one....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what the price of a haircut is in todays market,,,+++tip&#x27;s  Better GET ONE now!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill N</li>
    <li> Item broke in pieces unusable.would like refund.suppose to be new , hair inside box,box in shape looks like its been around awhile.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one about 22 years ago. I&#x27;m back for my second one, as the blade is finally dull. My partner and I have used it about twice a month for all this time, and saved a fortune over going to the barber. I always get exactly the haircut I want from the robocut, barbers often make a mess of my hair. Oil the blade every time, and treat it gently and it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions and make sure you oil it.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  It takes some practice cutting your hair in the mirror but it&#x27;s worth the investment.  I hate having to wait at the barbershop and spend money each month.</li>
    <li> We hook the Robocutter to our central vac so there is no clean-up! The only thing that we would want to change is to make the cord longer! Our boys ( 5 1/2 and 4) haircuts look great and they don&#x27;t complain about itching because there is no hair on their neck! Yeah! We even tried on the back hair on our 18 month old daughter and she loved it! The Robocut takes the frustration out of at home haircuts!!</li>
    <li> I cut my dogs hair with this and he loved it but it stopped working before I could finish :(</li>
    <li> This totally sucks hardly cuts hair and have to oil it all the time. Forget about trying to cut dog hair it can&#x27;t cut my thin hair. Of all the things I&#x27;ve bought on amazon this is the only thing I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> We bought it and when we went to use it the second time it died. Not worth the money - stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly. I have been using this for years with great results. This is my third one I have owned</li>
    <li> Folks,&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the device since 2001, after I showed up at the salon , only to be told that they overbooked. I went on line for a Flowbee, and found this. For $50.00, I figured I would try it. Never looked back. I have fine hair, and so does Q-tip, my 10 pound Maltese.I cut my hair in 4 minutes, with perfect results every time. Between myself and the Q, I have saved enough to buy a new motorcoach! Kidding. But I am into the thousands! Try one and you will be surprised! It&#x27;s almost FUN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robbo [no joke!]</li>
    <li> I purchased a robocuter eight months ago. I used it four times to give my 4 pound Multi Poo&#x27;s hair cuts.    It quit cutting my puppies hair half way through the fourth hair cut.    This piece of equipment is the absolute worst thing I have ever wasted my money on.    I followed the oiling directions to a tee.  It would be better and cheaper to take my dogs to a groomer.    From what I see on these ratings you only accept the good ratings.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 of these in the past 15 years.  The older model (white) worked great until the neck cracked open.  On the new model (red) the blades only have 4 tines (?) where they used to have 6.  Also the grid above the blades is different.  It&#x27;s smaller and square where it used to have larger openings and was shaped more like a starburst.  The square design with fewer tines/blades seems to make it harder to cut hair.  And it PULLS (ouch).  It does cut the hair, but just not as well (or as painless) as the older model.  I wish I&#x27;d kept the blade assembly from my old one.  I used a Flowbee before I bought my first Robocut so if I were to rank these I would say:     #1 - older model Robocut  #2 - Flowbee  #3 - new model Robocut    Bottom line is I am very unhappy with the new design of the Robocut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned both the Flowbee &amp; RoboCut. Never had a problem with Flowbee, but wanted to try the RoboCut. I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve had 2 versions of the RoboCut. I believe I&#x27;m using the R28. The previous version was so-so. There was a huge improvement from the previous version. Whenever I have called for service, they are great. This last time, my unit just stopped. The service agent walked me through some diagnostics with no success. Next thing I know, I&#x27;m being sent a new haircutter. I&#x27;m not getting the whole package, but I don&#x27;t need it. Anytime I&#x27;ve called, I have got great service. What I like when I call is that I get someone who knows the product. I&#x27;m not getting some person who&#x27;s hired to answer phones &amp; take orders. Very helpful!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reading here how the Robocut doesn&#x27;t work well or last long. My experience couldn&#x27;t be more totally opposite of those remarks. Makes me wonder if any of them actually read the care and use directions. I bought a Robocut 17 years ago and have used it for every haircut since then with the exception of one. I was in a contest that included a Gala Ball and decided to get a professional cut. Big mistake. So my Robocut has done every haircut before and since that fiasco.     It is very simple to use. If you are going to cut long hair short, do it in two stages. Remove almost down to the length you want then go over it with the final length. Results is just fine. No one believes me when I tell them I cut my hair myself.     As for durability? I don&#x27;t know what these people are doing wrong. I oiled it every use like it recommends. I used the same blades for 15 years before replacing them. Keep them oiled and they last. I am now replacing my Robocut. Why? Because I dropped it on the garage floor and it finally broke. It still cut my hair just fine right before I dropped it.     So by the sounds of it, the new model has better blades, better plastic AND METAL gears. If this is the case, I can&#x27;t see how it can&#x27;t be just as good as my old one was. Just keep it oiled and follow the directions and you can&#x27;t go wrong. I for one never want to see the inside of a \\&quot;salon\\&quot; again (where did all the barbers go?) Hope this helps some of you out.</li>
    <li> First impression: Oddly I received my new RoboCut having the screws only loosely attached on the motor/gear assembly... not positively impressed with that, but other than that the quality seems fine. I secured those screws before testing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old model: I own a previous white model RoboCut which I purchased about 13 years ago. Months ago the gears started to fail, causing the blade to intermittently stop turning &amp; grab hair. For some period of time I could get it to not slip by applying pressure to the back of the motor/gear assembly. I was able to give it a little more service time after I cracked the assembly open (no screws, but snap-fit on the old unit) and swapped the gears around (yielding another 1-1/2 haircuts - as which you can imagine resulted in an unfavorable situation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments: I&#x27;m hoping the new length extenders are of better quality than the old. A few of those old ones cracked &amp; broke within a year or two of buying it. The old ones were designed to hold together by the pressure fit, whereas the new attachments have an interlocking design that seems to be an improvement. We&#x27;ll have to see if those resist cracking at the locking points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionality: I am satisfied with the performance of the unit. The blades cut well and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it seizing up or getting hair pinched up in it. I&#x27;m using a fairly powerful (maybe too powerful) shop vac with it and at times I&#x27;ve worried that my skin could stretch into the blades, but so far that hasn&#x27;t happened. The noise of the cutter &amp; vacuum can make for quite a loud hair-cutting session. The importance of stopping often to keep the blades oiled during the haircut cannot be overstressed. You&#x27;ll hear the cutter start to slow down when it needs oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Despite the hopefully rare incomplete assembly of the new (&amp; mediocre robustness of the old version), the new version seems to be improved in overall quality and I feel it will last longerthan the old one. I chose RoboCut based on its value, versatility, &amp; truly great haircuts possible. The unit I received is blue. It was unclear from the description/pictures whether it would be red or blue. NBD!</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions and don&#x27;t try to open up your own barbershop or dog grooming joint, this device should give many years of service.  I keep my hair about an inch and a half on top and a quarter inch on the sides--a very simple haircut that&#x27;s now free that used to cost me 15 bucks a pop at the barber shop.  I touch it up every 2 weeks with this device and I use a Wahl trimmer around the ears and neckline.  Just use it on clean dry hair and keep it oiled like the directions tell you to do and you won&#x27;t have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some of the sellers here use the same ad, copy and pasted, without reading it very well and the ad says &amp;#34;Free HairLine&amp;#34; included.  I opted for that and it didn&#x27;t come with the robocut as advertised.  It&#x27;s just a guide for trimming the neckline in the back and really isn&#x27;t necessary if your spouse is willing to trim back there for you and isn&#x27;t blind.  Look for ads that don&#x27;t promise &amp;#34;Free HairLine&amp;#34; and they&#x27;re much less expensive BUT if you do want it make sure the seller really is going to send it to you or else you&#x27;re going to be paying the higher price and NOT actually getting it.  Take a screenshot of their ad promising the HairLine prior to ordering it and save the screenshot--you may need it.</li>
    <li> I USED THIS ON MY DOGS BECAUSE THEY PROTESTED THE GROOMER SO MUCH.  THEIR EARS ARE SENSITIVE AND THEIR SKIN AND HAIR ARE VERY SENSITIVE,,, IT HAS WORKED GREAT.  I USED IT ON MY NEPHEW AFTER USING IT ON MY DOGS, LOL AND HIS HAIR LOOKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than other similarly priced units.  I bought my daughter one of her own, so she would quit borrowing mine!</li>
    <li> Save a ton of money. Slide the cutter to the length, connect to a vacuum and start running it over your hair. I am super picky and I was very pleased. I started in small increments and then found the length I wanted. I think I was done in under five minutes. It is more precise than hand cutting. Read the instructions and hold it correctly and you will do fine. My hair grows so fast this is just what I needed. I cut everyone&#x27;s hair now and it turns out great. The Robocut slide mechanism gives your more options than spacers. I put a piece of colored tape on the slide for the length that works for me. It has paid for itself!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product a few years ago. Got enough hair cuts out of it to make it worth while. Suprised it lasted this long since it seems cheaply made. It now pulls out my hair when cutting and I don&#x27;t see any way to order and replacement blades or anything. Not too happy that there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it now. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. There&#x27;s got to be something of better quality out there, and something that works better too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product; wonderful customer service; highly recommend. I have used the device for almost two years and it does an extremely good job. Furthermore, the company offers outstanding customer service!</li>
    <li> I have had a Robocut for at least 16 years. In these 16 years the only thing that I have done to it was purchase a blade or two. This is one of the easiest haircutters to use. Hook it to the vucuum, plug it in and your ready to go. No mess to clean up, no appointments to make or waiting in line to get your hair cut. I would recommend the Robocut to anyone. If something was to happen to my Robocut I would order another one no questions asked. Thanks you Robocut, I have saved lots of money and time cutting my hair in the pass years. For anyone reading this....I would try it!...For the price of a cople of hair cuts....Who knows, you may end up loving it &amp; saving lots of time and money in years to come...</li>
    <li> I got my Robocut (the older white model) 10 years or so ago, and haven&#x27;t paid for a haircut since. From the first try I was able to cut my own hair (I&#x27;m a man, and my hair is fairly short, tapered in the back) pretty well, and by the third or fourth haircut I had it down to 10 minutes including setup and cleanup. The only thing I&#x27;ve had to fix on it is the hose, which developed a crack up near the Robocut itself, and that was easy to fix with some Gorilla tape. I&#x27;ve ordered new blades a few times, but even so my haircut costs have got to be in the \\&quot;$1 or less each\\&quot; range over the last ten years, which has saved me tons of money, not to mention time, which to me is even more important. I never tried a Flowbee, but I can recommend the Robocut highly, especially in a case like mine where it&#x27;s getting fairly light use. Not sure how it would hold up as a dog-grooming tool, but it&#x27;s been a huge money and time saver for me.</li>
    <li> We love the Robocut, my husband was in the military and we have four sons, haircuts were a \\&quot;huge\\&quot; expense for us.  This did the job for all of them, and myself as well.  WE love the robo cut.  I have read the other reviews, that it \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; hair.  You do need to do maintenace on your unit.  Keep it cleaned and oiled.  We have been using the robot cut for 10 years and this is our second unit. When we wear this one out, we will purchase our third unit.  This unit is only 3 years old so have many years to go before that happens.  Customer service for the unit is fantastic, Alfred is awesome.  We cannot recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> The Robocut came in the time specified.  The product was Blue instead of Red, like the picture shows.  It has an extra feature the Red one doesn&#x27;t.  It has the ability to trim a hairline and that&#x27;s GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate this seller and hope the best for them.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Robocut since 2007 and have owned competitors&#x27; products as well.  The Robocut gives me more precise control over hair styling than the other cutters I have used, and it allows me to cut quite a bit shorter as well.  That makes it possible to get the kind of cut I could only get by hand before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easy and inexpensive to get replacement parts, so you don&#x27;t have to buy a new one when some small piece wears out.  Mine has lasted all these years and still works great.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a very sharp, EVEN, all the way around cut, you should give this product a try!  Robocut cuts very evenly.  How many times have you gone to the salon and the stylist cuts one side longer then the other.  This product will always cut your hair evenly all the way around.  I am a licensed stylist and I use this product when I cut my own hair.  It&#x27;s the only way I can get the results I need for me.  I&#x27;ve tried cutting with scissors, and its absolutely impossible!  After you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll absolutely love ROBOCUT.  You won&#x27;t need to go to the barber anymore!</li>
    <li> Must need to have a lot of vacumn suction for it to cut!  Im still working on it! thanks!! I only hav one head to cut!</li>
    <li> I have owned and used a Robocut since 2006 and have not been to a barber shop since I received it.  It is simple to use and provides an excellent, neat, and professional-looking haircut.  I don&#x27;t know the amount, but I have saved hundreds of dollars by using the Robocut, and I am always happy with the haircut.  Quick touch-ups before a meeting are a breeze without the hassle of going to a barber.  I highly recommend the Robocut- you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had and used a Robocut since 2009 and love it. Everyone that sees my hair always asks where I get my hair cut and I tell them to BUY this product.  I cut my mom&#x27;s hair and now my sister cuts her own.  We all are forever sold on having a ROBOCUT.  It is the BEST thing I have invested in and to make it even more attractive it is inexpensive and very easy to use. After using this for 3 years, every 2 weeks, and even having several other people borrowing this Robocut, mine is still cutting like the day I received it.  I love this product so much that I just bought another one to store it away so that I am NEVER without a Robocut.</li>
    <li> I have had the Robocut system since they were first put on the market. I presently have the Pro series and it works great. It is easy to use and easy to set up and put away. I haven&#x27;t been to a barber shop in 14 years. I do the cutting all by myself, including the triming. I highly recommend this system.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied user</li>
    <li> I have owned a Robocut since 2001 and neither my husband or I need expensive salon services any more.  We also cut our son&#x27;s hair and our dog&#x27;s.  We oil it properly and take good care of it.  Recently the hose split and Robocut replaced it under warranty with no questions asked.  I can&#x27;t imagine not having this product.  I have not tried any other vacuum haircutting product so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other since owning the Robocut, I have not felt the need to try any other.</li>
    <li> I have been using either a FlowBee or a Robutcut for many years.  They used to be good.  Their customer service used to be great.  No more.  The original FlowBee ran great, but it got old &amp; overused &amp; finally died.  So, I purchased a Robocut (same company).  It would yank &amp; pull at my hair instead of cutting.  I contacted them, &amp; they sent me a whole new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped the cutting head on the concrete floor, &amp; that was that for that one.  I recently purchased another Robocut.  More yanking &amp; pulling!  I contacted the manufacturer by e-mail several times but finally they responded via phone.  They asked for my address so I gave it to them.  I had to call them several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They finally sent replacement blades.  With no instructions at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not seeing another way to get to the blades, I unscrewed the 4 screws &amp; removed the bottom with the motor.  Unable to get to the blades, I put it back together.  Now, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the last Robocut I will ever buy!</li>
    <li> Used it maybe 2 times and followed directions and it sucked my hair to the scalp while ripping,twisting,pulling and was stuck.Would not work in reverse,my hair was stuck so I either had to cut it loose with a straight razor or just pull it off with my hair twisted in it...I chose to rip it off with a large clump of hair.&lt;br /&gt; This should be taken off the market!&lt;br /&gt;For Gods sake don&#x27;t use this on kids or pets,let alone yourself.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</li>
    <li> I bought one of these six or seven years ago and it worked fine.  When it finally broke (because I dropped it), I ordered a new one.  Maybe it&#x27;s a different manufacturer now, but the unit felt cheaper and didn&#x27;t last one haircut.  The motor spun off-center, didn&#x27;t cut my hair, and then burned out and quit.</li>
    <li> I think this will pay for itself soon!  I just cut my hair for the first time, and it did a great job.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Largely junk now.  I had purchased a robocut quite a while ago.  It worked great.  They have obviously changed either the manufacturing of the blades or the design.  It mainly just pulls your hair out now.  I moved to the flowbee and like that cut a bit better anyway.  No more hair pulling with the flowbee.  If I purchased a new flowbee I bet it would be Chinese junkified, though.  So, I&#x27;ll make this one last as long as possible.  Why companies have gone backwards with quality is beyond me.  It&#x27;s the same with every product.</li>
    <li> I remember the Flowbee commercials from when I was a kid...and in looking at the Flowbee came across the Robocut.  It&#x27;s the same concept--but a lot cheaper.  I have four young kids--so spending even $12-15 per haircut can add up.  I had tried using my husband&#x27;s clippers on their hair...but I have trouble using the guides/combs.  The Robocut is pretty much idiotproof--which I like.  You need to oil it before each use...which is not a big deal...just a few drops...and then you run it for a few seconds without your vaccuum running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut two of my boys hair with it.  The hair cuts take only a few minutes.  They recommend measuring the hair with one of the guides...and then going down just a bit, so that&#x27;s what I did.  It cut very well--although on my son with thicker hair, it was more difficult to get a good cut (had to go over it more times).  Still....great haircut....even.... and no mess. The kids said it tickled.  My one concern is the noise level (due to the machine plus the vacuum) near the ears.  I think I&#x27;ll put ear plugs on them next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would also work well on pets.</li>
    <li> this is the nearest piece of junk I have ever wasted my money on. would not recommend to my enemies.</li>
    <li> I bought one 10 years ago that was well built and lasted 7 years. I bought a replacement blade but it just pulled my dogs hair without cutting it. I broke down and purchased a new robocut last year, but it was pure junk and cracked easily. I could see the differences of a company trying to cut costs and shave every nickel they could. It is a great idea, but the design could be much better if they would have left it alone and not thinned the plastic of the body so razor thin that it breaks. They obviously will not correct the problem if people keep buying it. The old one worked great for my maltese. I just got another maltese after he died. I suppose I will buy the flowbee and give it a shot. Or, I may just use the electric shears from now on. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Amazon would not allow my rating . Do not buy this cutter</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have used RoboCut for years now.  I use to have my hair cut professionally. But, all but one person cut my hair badly. What I mean is they cut your hair then comb it, blow it, hair spray it and walaaa! It looks great, that is until the next day after you wash it, comb it and see that it doesn&#x27;t lay right, then inspect it and see that not all the hair was cut evenly. All this and they expect a tip on top of what they charged.&lt;br /&gt;Well I did my homework and found that the best vacum cutter out there was the RoboCut. My first RoboCut was the best. It did what it was suppose to and lasted a long time. Sense then I&#x27;ve had a few RoboCuts and have never gone back to the so called professionals.&lt;br /&gt;My son, asks me to cut his hair with the RoboCut. And that&#x27;s nice not having to chase him down to keep him looking presentable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that it would be real hard for any person to cut so evenly as the RoboCut.&lt;br /&gt;Today I had some difficultly with the RoboCut and called Alfred (inventor). He said that he&#x27;d mail me out the warranty parts. I said that I wanted to order an extra Robocut. He said that he would put the parts I needed in with the new RoboCut and that I would not be charged for shipping of the new parts.&lt;br /&gt;So, RoboCut gave me Great service, and has a new updated unit with even better features, 2 year warranty. And it was on Sale to, RoboCut.com.&lt;br /&gt;RoboCut saves me time from making an hair appoint, burning gas and time going to the hair cutter along with the frustration of a less than good hair cut.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair cutting system in 2008, I figured I saved at least $200.00 a year not counting the time I would have spent going to the barber. It gives great hair cuts and beard trimming.  It takes me about 10 minutes to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> this product is easy to attach to your vacuum cleaner.&lt;br /&gt; after attaching to vacuum hose, was able to cut my own hair in only a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;depending on how often a person cuts their own hair, it would easily pay for the cost of purchase&lt;br /&gt;in months.after that , the cuts are free.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of time and money.  Doesn&#x27;t cut your hair right.  Leaves lines, varying hair length.  I got ripped off.  Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased our first Robocutter in the late 80&#x27;s after reading an ad in Popular Science.  I did 50 haircuts a year between myself and the kids for 20+ years, so I figure I saved at least $10K in haircuts doing it myself.  We finally wore out the first unit and bought a second one in 2011.  When I look at how little we spent on the cutter, how well the cuts turned out, how much time we saved not waiting to get a cut, and how much money we saved, I think that purchasing the Robocutter was one of the better investments I made.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping.  Only problem is the hose won&#x27;t stay connected to the vacuum.  I have to hold it in order to use the cutter.  Not the sellers fault just a manufacturer defect.  I use it anyway!</li>
    <li> I have owned my RoboCut for many years. I owned a Flowbee before that but my Robocut is a keeper. The Flowbee motor quit working.  When I found Robocut I was intrigued with the flexibilty. I love how I can cut my hair shorter than Flowbee and also the flexibility in lengths is a great benefit.</li>
    <li> I like it. Does a great job and I suppose I will need to see a barber once a year just for the old memory sake.</li>
    <li> I know of someone who had the following experience! PLEASE DO NOT USE ON YOUR PETS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is actually a product like flowbee just for dogs. The Robocut is reasonably priced. We bought it and did not use it on our dog when we realized that you have to hook it up to a vacuum to get it to work. Our dog is terrified of vacuum&#x27;s so we never used it. However, our daughter got a dog who was really chill and needed a cut. We pulled out the Robocut. All was going well on the back and then my husband and daughter flipped the dog over to do his abdomen. The cutter sucked the skin up with the hair into the blades. It took out a 50 cent piece size of the whole epidermal layer. He had to have emergency surgery to fix it. Thankfully it did not get the muscle layer and thankfully they weren&#x27;t under his neck at the time. We will throw this product in the trash in tiny pieces once we have resolved our claim w/ the company. I know it looks like people have good luck with this product if the dog will sit still for it, but when it goes bad, it is really bad. And yes, we read and followed the instructions for the product prior to use.</li>
    <li> I had what I think was the orignial which had a white sealed body. It broke in less than a year. The blades wouldn&#x27;t spin due to the motor not running. I sent it back under warranty. They fixed it for free but then it broke again in a few months! It was just me using it, so that was maybe 2 or 3 hair cuts. That original one had a weak motor. Years later I got another one. This one had the red body. The newest one appears to have a blue body. But this second one broke after less than 2 years. The problem appears to be the switch or electrical problem where the motor would not turn on, unless I banged it against the carpet while on. Sometimes I could get it running this way and sometimes I couldn&#x27;t. This problem developed within the first 6 months and got worse until it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore. The body had also cracked but I wrapped duct tape around it. And when I got it, the hair spacers would fall off. The first spacer that slid on the red body was snug, but additional clear spacers stacked on that first one would fall off within seconds of using it. I had to duct tape the spacers on.</li>
    <li> Thru the years, I am REALLY fed up with going to a store for a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Out of my frustration from bad cuts, poor service &amp; waiting in line much too long,&lt;br /&gt;I decided to \\&quot;fight back\\&quot; - vowing NEVER to return anywhere for a haircut again.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use it at first, being a novice.&lt;br /&gt;My hair got very long &amp; unkempt, I was finally forced to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RoboCut preformed flawlessly &amp; I am very pleased with the excellent results!&lt;br /&gt;No more going out to get a haircut &amp; of course, leaving the expected tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just 3 more times &amp; it has payed for itself.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how long the unit will last, but I would buy another one right away.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a year ago.  I don&#x27;t cut my hair very often because its a medium short style, so i might have used this about 20 or so times.  Now what happened with the Robocut is the spacing between the guide blade and the spinning blade opened up allowing hair to get entangled around the middle (think of a girl with long hair getting too close to the fan).  Think you can reverse it out after that?  NOPE, YOU WILL HAVE TO CUT OR RIP YOUR HAIR OUT.  Will probably try the flowbee next.</li>
    <li> I have been using my RoboCut to cut my hair short (~1/2\\&quot;) each month for well over a dozen years with good results with the original blades that I oil before each use as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the oil from the blades gets on my hair when cutting so I cut right before I hop in the shower for a shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total time each month about 10 minutes including grabbing vacuum and RoboCut and putting the gear away when I am done...Time efficient, good enough results and no money spent paying someone else to do my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried ONCE on my poodle and Bichon Frise and would not recommend RoboCut for curly haired dogs that you want to cut short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes the results well enough and thinks I am weird for cutting my own hair...She spends $90 every 6 weeks for a cut and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item can be found for less, if you Google around a bit</li>
    <li> I really like the robocut. Works very well and gives as good or better haircut than my barber did. Gets hair pretty short. Takes less time to cut hair than barber (not to mention the convenience of never having to get to the barbershop or waiting).</li>
    <li> No suction, doesn&#x27;t fit my vacuum hose, and arrived with missing components. Finally had to throw it out. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I tried to cut my hair with it this morning for the 10th time with the Robocut, always lubricating and alternating directions of blades and motor went totally out. Miss having my mechanical (no motor) Snip-It they do not produce any more that lasted me over 10 years. Now I am forced to try the Flobee and will eventually write a review on it also.</li>
    <li> I tried this robocut and works great. Just wish the hose was a bit longer and the power cord was not attached to the hose.</li>
    <li> I have used the robo cutter for 20 years and we love it. We just needed a new one We bought our first one at the Illinois state fair 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> I got one of these a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;With money being tight for most of us. I just had to share my experiance with this money saving product.&lt;br /&gt;A while back they had a problem with the power pack. They took care of it under warrenty two times.&lt;br /&gt;Sent the replacements right away. No questions asked, no hassles.&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s not given any more problems.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts great. Easy to use. Faster than waiting to have my hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;It paid for itself after the first year.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;What more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Robocut since 1993. That model would still be working if I had not dropped it this month, Nov 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it weekly for my hair, my children and even the wife discovered it worked very well for trimming her long hair. I used it to keep our Cockerspaniel&#x27;s hair clipped. That is some tough hair to cut. The regular dog hair clippers failed to work through the thick hair but the Robocut never quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Robocut about replacement parts and some repair advice. They had everything I needed at a price that was suprisingly low yet newer and improved designed motor and gears. They were most helpful with repair information, too. My 30 year old unit is repairable without buying new parts after my chat with their service rep, but I am going to retire it to my tinkering table and rebuild it to be used for cutting the dogs hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have the Thanksgiving sale going on and offered me an even better deal than advertised so I have retired the old and will get the new next week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to save money and have a great haircutter the Robocut is the best. I have tried my friends FloBee years back. It did not even come close to the quality and convience of the RoboCut unit. He got rid of it for a RoboCut.</li>
    <li> The Robocut system works okay. Not as well as I expected it to, but it does the job. I LOVE that the hair is vacuumed up as it gets cut, but it took FOREVER to cut my son&#x27;s hair. Luckily, he is a super mellow 1-year-old, he didn&#x27;t fuss at all even though it took over half an hour. I&#x27;m trying to decide whether to keep it or return it, if it&#x27;s returnable. Cutting his hair with clippers is much faster and easier albeit a bit messier. When I cut his hair with clippers, I was done within 15 minutes. Robocut takes patience (patience on my part, my son is fine either way). Not sure I would recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> THE ROBOCUT WILL SAVE YOU LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS! I know because I have saved thousands of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a RoboCut when my wife and I went to Japan to teach English from 1991-1993. When I first arrived there, my Japanese speaking skills were minimal and it was virtually impossible to communicate precise instructions for cutting my hair. I had to rely on pictures, gestures, a few curt expressions, and be happy with whatever I got. That was the first haircut shock. The second was the price. In Japan there are no discount, high-volume places to get your hair cut. It&#x27;s all mom and pop shops where they give you not only a haircut, but a shave and a scalp-neck-shoulder massage. It felt really nice, but at $60+ a crack, it hurt my pocketbook. So, in an effort to save money, I ordered a RoboCut and had it shipped to Japan. It was one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done and I&#x27;ve been using it and saving ever since. That was twenty years ago. If you figure that an average man gets his hair cut 10 times a year at an average cost of $20, that is $200 a year. I multiply that by 20 years and I&#x27;ve saved $4000!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality? I&#x27;ve been using my RoboCut for twenty years and it&#x27;s still going strong. You&#x27;ll find the RoboCut to be simple and ruggedly-built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance?  Not a problem. Just put a few drops of oil on the cutter before you begin and that&#x27;s it. The vacuum sucks up all of the hair so there is no mess to clean. If the cutting blade becomes dull, it is a simple matter of removing a tension ring, popping the old blade out, and putting the new one in. That&#x27;s it. It takes literally one minute or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique? Easy. Just cut longer on the top and shorter on the sides. The cutter is easily adjustable and it&#x27;s just a matter of sliding the guide to the desired measurement. Just remember to go slowly and cut just a little bit until you find what works for you. (You will also need a pair of barber scissors and/or some electric clippers for the outline of your hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, throw in the free two-year all-inclusive warranty and there is virtually no risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GET THE ROBOCUT AND START SAVING!</li>
    <li> It is to loud.  My husband needed ear plugs and still he could not tolerate the noise.  I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> We used a Robocut for years with great results. The new one doesn&#x27;t compare. There are too many blades on the outer plate and the hair won&#x27;t pull in, even with the new vacuum we bought. For some reason it works better on our schnauzer than the old one. We are looking at Flowbees and other brands. Do not buy this one.</li>
    <li> i cut my hair, and my pets. it was just as i expected. i just wish it had its own vaccuum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Robocut since 2001 and still am happy with it.  My first haircutting system was another brand, and when we changed, we never went back.  The extensions stay on, the service is great, and the results get unsolicited complements from friends and strangers.  My licensed cosmetologist friend is so jealous of the great results that she calls it \\&quot;sucky cuts.\\&quot;  That&#x27;s another great thing about it---no mess.  No going outdoors to do the family haircuts.  Thanks Robocut for a lot of money saved and great looks through the years.</li>
    <li> I have used Robocut for over ten years. I love it! I have short hair and therefore cut it every two weeks. I even travel with it so I can keep on my schedule!</li>
    <li> I own a Robocut, for a man  it does a great job.  You do have to replace the blades, depending on how long your hair is and how much you cut with the Robocut, but for me I replace the blades around every 6 months.  Now I don&#x27;t know about the Flowbee, but I have been told that the Flowbee will not cut any shorter than 1/4 inch.  I don&#x27;t know how true that is, but the Robocut will get down pretty low on the cut.  I can cut my hair really short, almost a crew cut with the Robocut. There is one problem I have noticed with the Robocut, the Tube at the end that measures the length of cut and has the cutting wheel in it wears out pretty quickly.  It will slide a little after some use.  So I use my thumb to keep it from sliding as I cut.  It works for me.  But for the price you can&#x27;t beat it, just think of the Barber and the money it costs to get your hair cut  over a one year span.  Can add up.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NOT BEEN TO A BARBER IN 19 YEARS! I BOUGHT MY FIRST ROBOCUT IN 1993.  THE ROBOCUT DOES A PERFECT \\&quot;HARVARD STYLE\\&quot; HAIRCUT SO MY HAIR IS THE SAME LENGTH ALL OVER.  A BARBER CAN ONLY COME CLOSE TO DOING THAT.  I EVEN BOUGHT A 2ND ONE IN 1996 \\&quot;JUST IN CASE\\&quot;.  IT IS GREAT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE MYSELF A HAIRCUT ANY DAY ANY TIME.  I HAVE SAVED A LOT OF MONEY OVER 19 YEARS.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using the Robocut R28 for the last 15 years and has saved us thousands of dollars in professional haircuts.  He was so tired of the wait time in the salons and the results that came with going to a professional shop.  We just ordered our third Robocut and he says as long as they continue to make Robocut, he will never go back to a professional shop because he can get the haircut his way, not to mention, he can cut his hair anytime he wants and does&#x27;nt have to leave home:). We definitely highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s quality and longevity.</li>
    <li> Works great. Saving me hundreds on hair cuts. Takes me about 15 minutes every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil this blades before every use and avery 15 minute during use and you will be a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these Robocuts a while back and my first impression when opening the box was that it was not built very well. I will go on to say that after I used it a couple of times it worked well enough that I actually liked it. With just a little practice it produced respectable hair cuts and was reasonably easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Unfortunately after a several hair cuts the poor quality caught up with it and rather than cut my hair it just tried to pull it out. The blades became dull and there is no easy way to sharpen or replace them.  I understand that the first thing someone will say is that I wasn&#x27;t taking care of it.. So let me just address this right away. The unit was cleaned and oiled each time it was used and it was used with a better than average vacuum cleaner. During use it was kept clear and occasionally oiled as well. It just is not built very good and is more of a throw away product that you get enough uses from to save some money and when it wears out you get a new one and begin the cycle again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  There are several design issues relating to the construction of the device which lower its quality and here are a few for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. The unit lacks power. The motor is undersized and over worked which can if you are not careful lead to overheating.&lt;br /&gt;  2. It is noisy. The motor&#x27;s high speed pitch whines along with the sound of the drive gears and with the vacuum the pair create quite a racket..&lt;br /&gt;  3. The speed of the cutting head is slow because the motor had to be geared down quite a bit to compensate for the lack of power. The slow speed leads to a choppy feel while it is cutting hair and at times rather than cut the hair it will just pull it in and you have to reverse the head to release it.&lt;br /&gt;  4.The Wall Wort power supply is sizable and heavy.and its cord to the motor extends up the vacuum tube but there is no escape for the cord when the tube is connected to a vacuum. I had to cut my tube to allow the cord to exit to take the strain off the cord.&lt;br /&gt;  5. The cutting heads dull after a few uses and cannot be sharpened or easily replaced without replacing the entire assembly adding to the cost of operation..&lt;br /&gt;  6. The cutting gauges that go on the front move around after a few uses because they are held in place by a few small bumps in the plastic along the side of the body. The plastic is soft and the bumps soon start to wear down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I give this product one star because I had two of them and my experience was the same with each having the same set of issues. I believe this product to be a so so implementation of an idea which had great potential. It can potentially save time and money but don&#x27;t expected it to last. Neither of mine have and at almost 70$ each the value really isn&#x27;t there unless it can operate reliably for at least 5 years.d to exit to take the strain off the cord.&lt;br /&gt;  5.

    <li> I will never go to a hair dresser again. It gave me a perfect boy&#x27;s cut. I love it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have used the Robocut 5 times it has worked great. My 4 year loves it to it is a adventure for him. Make sure you oil it everytime. Takes 5 minutes a haircut but much better than over a hour and waiting to get a haircut.</li>
    <li> We applied the lubricating oil as instructed and the unit still overheats after only five minutes of use. Returning for refund.</li>
    <li> great product, able to get a perfect cut every time in my own home.  Easy to use and no messy hair clips to clean up. Loved it so much now my best friend has one too.</li>
    <li> I ordered my R28 in 2005. I cut the top, then my wife does the back and final trimming.Saved a lot of money with it.It&#x27;s really easy to use, just follow the instuctions and go slow at first, you&#x27;ll get it quickly. I have literally not been in a barber shop since I bought it. I will probably buy a buy one in 2013 because my son has begun to use it too. Hooks up super easy to our 12 amp Bissel vacumm cleaner which is more than enough suction.I&#x27;ve worn out two sets of blades but they are very reasonable to replace. It gives a nice haircut, and it is a good quality machine.</li>
    <li> I purchased it back in 2001 and have been using it ever since. Have had to replace the blade once and am just now ordering the next new blade. My hair is very fine so maybe that helps with keeping the blades sharp, but otherwise I have had to do nothing except the recommended oiling and flip the switch to \\&quot;sharpen\\&quot; for 10 seconds after every use. I am looking to get more years out of it as it is quick, easy, and always gives me good results.</li>
    <li> March 2014,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY. I used to like this product and gave it 5 stars, but......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one of these Robocutters directly from Haircut.com and used it about 5 times over the course of their warranty. I have an older one and a Flowbee. The last time I used it, the housing cracked around the blade. I was able to take out the blade and put it in my old Flowbee and finish cutting. I noticed my older unit had a thicker wall surface in the tube that holds the blade and rear motor assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted these guys three times to find out if they could do something or if they had a higher end model I could purchase, so I would not have this problem. I really liked this unit for certain situations, but they have never gotten back to me and just blew me off. This product is inferior to Flowbee and is also inferior to my old tired Robocut. Do NOT Buy This garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct. 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned two of each. The Flowbee is far superior and will last much longer. I love the design on the Robocut and would prefer using it, but the motor they use is wimpy. I have not been to a barber in about 20 years, so either one will pay for itself. I use the Flowbee for myself and the Robocut for our small dog. While it is not a fair comparison, I originally bought the Robocut just for the dog as the design makes it easier. My dog is small, has long and fine hair and the sliding mechansim is ideal for cutting different lengths and around the legs and ears. Unfortunately, the blades turn slow and the hair gets caught between the blades. The blade mechanism busted within the warranty period on the first one and Robocut quickly replaced it. This second one I have had for about ten years also, but..... For humans, this will work just fine, though not as robust as the Flowbee. For pets, you will still get your money&#x27;s worth, but you have to be careful and not get too much hair in the tube at one time as it will slow, dull and possibly damage thecasing. It will give diminishing returns, but for a small pet, this is a nice option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a woman, you might prefer this one if you are thinking about buying one of the two, for when you can&#x27;t get to a stylist. It gives you more control, cuts smaller amounts of hair and will be more stable when cutting long hair. It just does not have the longevity as the Flowbee. For guys, this will work just fine, especially if you have long hair. My wife refuses to use either one though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my original Flowbee lasted over ten years. My second one is about the same age. I am still using the original box (the second one came with a cheap box) and all of the original attachments. I only use the Flowbee on myself, as I don&#x27;t want it to get dulled by using it on the dog and it is more cumbersome. For guys like me, with short, thin, and now thinning hair, I prefer the Fowbee. A buddy of mine used to laugh about it until he lost his job. Then he tried it and the cut was better than his hair stylist. Unfortunately, after the sissy got a job, he was too macho to DIY and went back to paying $100+ at the salon. I still laugh all the way to the bank. He had/has medium length(4\\&quot;) thick hair. That was 15 years ago. His wife cuts it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, either one will save you at least hundreds of dollars. I do wish Robocut would come out with a more torqued and faster spinning blade for animals. I would gladly pay for it. Both of these cutters will give you an XLNT ROI.</li>
    <li> I used a Flowbee a long time ago, but have owned two (non-vacuum) Robocuts since then. I absolutely love the convenience! In less than 10 minutes I can get it out, cut my hair, and have it all put away, with no mess. Whenever I have a wedding, funeral, interview, family photo, or trip, I can spruce up without having to leave home, pay money, or worry about a bad haircut. I&#x27;ve saved well over $2,000 on monthly haircuts over the past 12 years - and that doesn&#x27;t even include the savings for my two sons and dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pop-up trimmer on my electric razor that I use to cut an even hairline on the back of my neck and side burns after using the Robocut. The product could have been made a bit more durable, but even if you have to replace various parts of it every few years, it&#x27;s quite reasonable considering the savings, and well worth the price. I love being able to get a good, even haircut at any time, day or night. I also like that the company is based in Colorado, and the customer support is excellent. I will never go back to a barber!</li>
    <li> This hair trimmer is useless two thumbs down</li>
