      <li>I&#x27;ve used Mitchum for 35 years and found it to be the best for controlling underarm odor on hot days.</li>
      <li>I wish I could find this kind</li>
      <li>Thanks, Mitchum, for taking a perfect product and ruining it.  </li>
      <li>Works, smells nice, &#x27;nuff said.</li>
      <li>Also the mountain air scent resulted in comments from people asking what kind of cologne am I wearing when the Mitchum is all I am wearing.</li>
      <li>a good amount stuck up in the cap and more anywhere else it can spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different scents and liked Mountain Air best.</li>
      <li>Good deodorant, and not a bad price</li>
      <li>Anyone who is looking for a strong effective anti-perspirant/deodorant this is it.  </li>
      <li>very effective, smells great, keeps dry thanks for a great product</li>
      <li>This was such an excellent price too.</li>
      <li>I sweat a lot more than most people,</li>
      <li>The applicator has been changed and it must be to make you use more at a time.  </li>
      <li>Most Antiperspirants these days smell horrid.  </li>
      <li>Love the product, it has more in the bottle and lasts longer</li>
      <li>A deodorant for me has to be better than</li>
      <li>just okay like I said.</li>
      <li>The Unscented is okay, but</li>
      <li>It turns into a liquid and leaks through the many holes.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
      <li>I love that it comes with the subscribe and save plan since we use it every day, my husband and I.</li>
      <li>This sent is refreshing.  </li>
      <li>I like most of the Mitchum products.  </li>
      <li>I am glad they restocked it/.</li>
      <li>The only deodorant that stands up to my very potent teenager!!</li>
      <li>In fact, it may make me sweat more when putting it on.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>works well best I have ever used, keeps you dry and smell free doesn&#x27;t stain cloths either.way to go michum</li>
      <li>but then it soaks in to your skin and is fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;So - if your deodorant has 3 holes at the top, you probably have the last of the good stuff.</li>
      <li>The original was not 48-hour and held up every day.</li>
      <li>You will quickly become a fan too.</li>
      <li>Losing a loyal customer after 35 years must say something.</li>
      <li>If yours looks like a spaghetti strainer on the top - that&#x27;s the new stuff that is causing a lot of problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I, personally attempted to use Mitchum (not this kind) and it doesn&#x27;t do its job for me.</li>
      <li>Only kind I use.  </li>
      <li>Such a great deal compared to buying them in a regular store which are overpriced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a number of years now and like it very much.</li>
      <li>Great for people who can do alcohol and are sensitive to other deoderants.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be the first to go up to bat for this company...</li>
      <li>am sad that after years of having the best I will now search for one that works.</li>
      <li>I have used Mitchum for the first time now for a few weeks because it was on a good sale.  </li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even reduce my sweating anymore than the other brand I normally use, mine has a nice smell whereas this product has none.</li>
      <li>Mitchum Advanced Gel keeps me going fresh all day long in my high stress desk job.</li>
      <li>It really does work.  </li>
      <li>I tried this one out and really like the mountain air scent.  </li>
      <li>I run out almost twice as fast as I did before the &amp;#34;oxygen</li>
      <li>btw, this stuff really is super-effective (for me).</li>
      <li>Thanks, Mitchum.</li>
      <li>First of all, the new formula is way too watery for a gel.  </li>
      <li>Many other brands I get 4 hours  out of it</li>
      <li>Unless I can go back to the original proven formula, GOODBYE Mitchum.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Mitchum for over 20 years and it always worked better than any other deodorant/antiperspirant out there.  </li>
      <li>This version does seem to be a slight bit less effective than the older Mitchum gel, but its still significantly better for me than any alternatives.</li>
      <li>now get rashes and irritated arm pits plus the new stuff is very watery and gets everywhere.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I switched from Gillette years ago, because the cost was high</li>
      <li>On the high end of cost.</li>
      <li>I got a huge gross black rash on my armpits and I had to use ACV to pretty much burn it off!</li>
      <li>not gel.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly the new formula causes skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s time to find a new deodorant.</li>
      <li>That has changed with this new formula and applicator.  </li>
      <li>The new formula works just as well for me.</li>
      <li>Since they updated to the new formula this product has become unusable for me.  </li>
      <li>As the other reviewers have noted, the good reviews are for the previous generation of this</li>
      <li>; Avoid the new label Mitchum, and if you can still find the old product...  </li>
      <li>Love getting this product through Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; my husband prefers in stores.</li>
      <li>I can do so again now for you because I have hung onto that old container, as well as the unusable newer one.  </li>
      <li>For about a week I couldn&#x27;t figure it out until I decided to try an old stick I had and guess what?</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t thrown the old container out, so I compared labels.  </li>
      <li>I tried every deodorant and antiperspirant known to mankind until I was about 27 years old and always dealt with sweating and odor.</li>
      <li>while the old container actually had a cap with 3 bumps on the inside that plugged the three applicator holes through which the product is dispensed, the new container has dozens of holes and the cap does nothing to keep the watery gel inside.</li>
      <li>With Mitchum, I save a few pennies, stay dry, have no irritation --- and everybody says I smell better.</li>
      <li>which means that unless you live above the Arctic Circle, it will melt and leak all over</li>
      <li>Perhaps they changed it several times since 1983, but the most recent change came to my attention when a new container left my armpits raw after 2 or 3 uses.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really the only deodorant that&#x27;s responded well with my situations and as long as I don&#x27;t stink, there is not a problem.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works, smells nice, &#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> Been a fan of Mitchum for a few years now and for this price for a 4 pack...you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> It stained my clothing in the armpit area.  I wish I could find this kind but in the traditional roll-on, not the gel.</li>
    <li> Using this product caused a reaction that actually burned the skin under my arms. I am not a sensitive skin type and have used dozens of brands in my 47 years. I have never received burns from any other product. Maybe they went a little too heavy on the alchohol content. It may not cause you any harm but you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum product for years, NEVER HAD A PROBLEM, but this new formula burned my underarms and now I have this horrible rash....unable to wear deodorant at this time and that&#x27;s not good!</li>
    <li> I have used the Mitchum brand since 1983, after I moved to the Eastern U.S. and found out how useless most deodorants are in high-humidity conditions.  Mitchum was the only product I found that worked.    It is regrettable that Mitchum chose to change the active ingredient.  Perhaps they changed it several times since 1983, but the most recent change came to my attention when a new container left my armpits raw after 2 or 3 uses.    I hadn&#x27;t thrown the old container out, so I compared labels.  I can do so again now for you because I have hung onto that old container, as well as the unusable newer one.  Whence,  OLD ACTIVE INGREDIENT:  Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 20%  NEW ACTIVE INGREDIENT:  Aluminum Sesquichlorohydrate 25%    Thanks, Mitchum, for taking a perfect product and ruining it.  Some overpaid MBA probably figured out a way to save a fraction of a penny...    I&#x27;d rate it 0 if I could!</li>
    <li> Product arrives on time and in good shape.  Works well, have used it for years.  I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; one to use!</li>
    <li> But instead, I got something that&#x27;s worse and burns my underarms like crazy! I HATE this stuff, biggest waste of money for deodorant ever. It doesn&#x27;t even reduce my sweating anymore than the other brand I normally use, mine has a nice smell whereas this product has none.</li>
    <li> Since they updated to the new formula this product has become unusable for me.  The new product is very runny and as it dries becomes sticky and very uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> THIS SUFF  works for 24 hours and then some over night too. Many other brands I get 4 hours  out of it</li>
    <li> My husband loves Mitchum. It&#x27;s the ONLY deodorant that works for him. This was such an excellent price too. The stores in my area sell them for around the same price however the sticks are half the size of these ones. My husband is both happy and satisfied. I, personally attempted to use Mitchum (not this kind) and it doesn&#x27;t do its job for me. The Women&#x27;s Mitchum is horrible. The Unscented is okay, but just okay like I said. A deodorant for me has to be better than just okay, it must be excellent!!!</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot more than most people, Its not out of control but its definitely noticeable. I had a family member recommend this to me a few years ago and since then its the only deodorant I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really never had a problem with this product and I&#x27;ve bought it for years. It&#x27;s really the only deodorant that&#x27;s responded well with my situations and as long as I don&#x27;t stink, there is not a problem.</li>
    <li> Great product as stated in my title i have not broke a sweat and it smells awesome but the only thing is that it is a gel like hair gel and im not sure how much to put on, also since its a gel it feels cold and wet but then it soaks in to your skin and is fine, I will probably buy this deodorant again when i need more, a great product, hope this review helped.</li>
    <li> I like most of the Mitchum products.  I tried this one out and really like the mountain air scent.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind. Never have to worry about wet underarms. You stay dry all day with this product</li>
    <li> Love the product, it has more in the bottle and lasts longer so I will be getting this again and again</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant my husband will use and i got a great deal and a cpupon on my subscribe and save!</li>
    <li> Best product, my husband loves these</li>
    <li> I know what M. Truzo is talking about in the previous message. You can have bad reactions to different deodorants -- which is exactly why I have used Mitchum for many years -- everything else I&#x27;ve tried causes knots to form in my arm pits. I guess we all have to find what works for us...    btw, this stuff really is super-effective (for me).</li>
    <li> Not 100% sold on the scent...but then again no Mitchum&#x27;s have a great scent.  This version does seem to be a slight bit less effective than the older Mitchum gel, but its still significantly better for me than any alternatives.</li>
    <li> Love getting this product through Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; my husband prefers in stores. I have ordered it now twice. It lands at my door &amp; I don&#x27;t have to run around town trying to find it!! Will continue in the future as well!</li>
    <li> I tried every deodorant and antiperspirant known to mankind until I was about 27 years old and always dealt with sweating and odor. Nothing I tried worked, until I tried Mitchum. I am 48 now, and have used it ever since then, and it is still the only deodorant that works for me. Also the mountain air scent resulted in comments from people asking what kind of cologne am I wearing when the Mitchum is all I am wearing. There have been times I couldn&#x27;t find it and had to buy something different, which resulted in the same old sweat and odor.  I will always use this product.</li>
    <li> I loved my mitchum gel mountain air. It worked all day and then some.&lt;br /&gt;Now mitchum has redesigned and reformulated it.&lt;br /&gt;First power of oxygen is just a changed ingredient that does not work , after 4 hours it fails.&lt;br /&gt;Second the slots that the gel comes out of are changed too so now it comes out like water not gel.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly the new formula causes skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I am sad that after years of having the best I will now search for one that works.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mitchum for years and have always loved it.  That has changed with this new formula and applicator.  First of all, the new formula is way too watery for a gel.  It stains my shirts now.  The applicator has been changed and it must be to make you use more at a time.  I run out almost twice as fast as I did before the &amp;#34;oxygen control technology&amp;#34;.  It is a shame that companies change what works.  Now it&#x27;s time to find a new deodorant.</li>
    <li> Thanks, Mitchum. I switched from Gillette years ago, because the cost was high and I was getting some irritation -- especially in the summer.  With Mitchum, I save a few pennies, stay dry, have no irritation --- and everybody says I smell better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d be the first to go up to bat for this company... I LOVED (past tense) Mitchum for YEARS!!! but they changed the ingredients and now it&#x27;s driving me crazy! My arm pits swelled up, became itchy under the skin and I was in misery! For about a week I couldn&#x27;t figure it out until I decided to try an old stick I had and guess what? NO PROBLEMS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - if your deodorant has 3 holes at the top, you probably have the last of the good stuff. If yours looks like a spaghetti strainer on the top - that&#x27;s the new stuff that is causing a lot of problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn you, Mitchum for having to change what was already perfect. Damn you....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this deidorant works best for me. I friend of mine told me about it years ago.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant that stands up to my very potent teenager!!</li>
    <li> This new version with the new active ingredient is horrible. It may stop me from smelling but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my sweat... In fact, it may make me sweat more when putting it on.</li>
    <li> Great all around seller, price</li>
    <li> Only kind I use.  Works great for my lifestyle for up to 48 hours as stated.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I just love it. Keeps me dry all day, has no sticky feel. If you have never tried it, you should. You will quickly become a fan too.</li>
    <li> Good deodorant, and not a bad price</li>
    <li> great smell I am glad they restocked it/.</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t buy this stuff! I got a huge gross black rash on my armpits and I had to use ACV to pretty much burn it off! Disgusting!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum for 35 years and found it to be the best for controlling underarm odor on hot days. They reformulated to a new 48-hour gel and let me tell you it literally STINKS!  I smell after 3-4 hours. They call this &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34;? The original was not 48-hour and held up every day. Unless I can go back to the original proven formula, GOODBYE Mitchum.  Losing a loyal customer after 35 years must say something. I hope they&#x27;re listening...</li>
    <li> I liked the old Mitchum gel, but this new version is terrible.  As the other reviewers have noted, the good reviews are for the previous generation of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new product is so watery that it leaks all over, running down the sides of the container when you roll even a small amount out to be applied.  This gets on your hands, your bathroom counter, etc. and is hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making matters worse, while the old container actually had a cap with 3 bumps on the inside that plugged the three applicator holes through which the product is dispensed, the new container has dozens of holes and the cap does nothing to keep the watery gel inside. So forget packing it in your gym bag or suitcase--you&#x27;ll find it everywhere: a good amount stuck up in the cap and more anywhere else it can spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mitchum for over 20 years and it always worked better than any other deodorant/antiperspirant out there.  But they changed the active ingredient, and now all of a sudden I am getting a rash and skin burns under my arms.  It&#x27;s basically unusable and now I have to find another product.</li>
    <li> Keeps me from stinking.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a number of years now and like it very much. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different scents and liked Mountain Air best. Nothing negative to say...it does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> best product in this category if you ask me! very effective, smells great, keeps dry thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> the best anti perspirant-deoderant I have ever used. Been using at least 10 yrs, keeps me dry 99.5% of the time. Can definitely tell when I have missed a &#x27;dose&#x27; . On the high end of cost.</li>
    <li> Mitchum Advanced Gel keeps me going fresh all day long in my high stress desk job.</li>
    <li> I have, thru the years tried many different deodorants, well many of them would fail badly before the end of the day, my girlfriend, a nurse, told me to try Mitchum.  It really does work.  I love that it comes with the subscribe and save plan since we use it every day, my husband and I. The price is fair an so one lest thing to think about keeping in stock in the house!</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant, and lasts the longest. Such a great deal compared to buying them in a regular store which are overpriced.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for years and it&#x27;s never let me down. I will continue using this deodorant from now on.</li>
    <li> Mitchum took a great product (Mitchum Unscented Power Gel) and ruined it! Not only does it cause rashes, but it does not stay in gel form. It turns into a liquid and leaks through the many holes. On vacation it continually leaked in my suitcase. I had to keep Kleenex in the lid to absorb the liquid. I used to keep it in a drawer on its side, but now I have to leave it out and keep it vertical or it gets all over everything. Dumb move, Mitchum.</li>
    <li> works well best I have ever used, keeps you dry and smell free doesn&#x27;t stain cloths either.way to go michum</li>
    <li> Great for people who can do alcohol and are sensitive to other deoderants.  ive tried lots of them, some will actually burn my skin....Mitchum is the best ive found.</li>
    <li> Almost 20 year user here - unfortunately, like others here have found, company recently changed the formula and packaging and is AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now get rashes and irritated arm pits plus the new stuff is very watery and gets everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find the older bottles, dark green with only three slots in the applicator, buy all you can that was the best stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new package has lots of smaller holes almost pitted like a golf ball and is HORRIBLE. .</li>
    <li> Anyone who is looking for a strong effective anti-perspirant/deodorant this is it.  Most anti-perspirants irritate my skin and gets uncomfortable as the day goes on.  This gel works great and does not irritate and has a good scent.</li>
    <li> I smell like a man should.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time Mitchum user, and in the past year or so I have been finding it more difficult to source Mitchum at my usual spots.  Decided to order a 4 pack, and have decided this was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like everything that works this day and age it has some ingredient that has been &amp;#34;shown to cause cancer in California&amp;#34; or something and it is reformulated, to never work again.  This is another one of those instances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the gel has a melting point of approx. 58 degF which means that unless you live above the Arctic Circle, it will melt and leak all over everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR; Avoid the new label Mitchum, and if you can still find the old product...  BUY IT ALL!</li>
    <li> Most Antiperspirants these days smell horrid.  This sent is refreshing.  The new formula works just as well for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum for the first time now for a few weeks because it was on a good sale.  At about the same time I began having a strange underarm rash that I never had before.  After reading a lot about underarm rashes and reviews of this deodorant, I threw out the Mitchum and will never buy it again. I would have given no stars if the page allowed itm</li>
