      <li>Amazing brush especially  for my daughter because she has thick natural hair and its works excellent on her hair.</li>

      <li>Very practical brush which is just the right size.</li>

      <li>I moved away recently and needed a new brush for myself.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a young mixed race woman and its hard to find good brushes for thick hair like mine.</li>
      <li>Definitely travel size, I&#x27;m not sure it would be adequate for really thick or curly hair but for my moderately thick, straight-ish-wavy-ish hair, it&#x27;s a good travel brush.</li>

    <li> After seeing so many YouTubers use it to style their hair, I decided to try it. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the price though! That&#x27;s definitely a con in my book. But the only brush I had at the time was a curling brush so I needed something else for my short pixie cut. At first, it actually pulled some of my type 4 (b/c combo) hair out! My hair barely came to my ears so I was trying to retain length not have hair come out! But instead of throwing the brush out, I saw online that you can take the rows out so I took out two rows and the brush works so much better now! It is AMAZING. Love it. I use it now to detangle my hair, to wrap my hair, and to smooth my hair before roller setting. And there is minimum hair loss.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs. Well made and easy to use. I own two, and one lives permanently in my travel kit.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair....a mix of 3c &amp; 4a.  This brush makes detangling a breeze.  I have purchased other plastic bristle brushes at my local CVS &amp; Walgreens, but the plastic tab on the ends always end up falling off.  I have decided to end the madness and just invest a valuable brush and stop buying the generic knock-offs.  Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> This is not a full-sized brush, so if you&#x27;re looking for something in a travel size it&#x27;s perfect. Otherwise, just be aware.</li>
    <li> I love this brush it&#x27;s just awesome and goes easily through my hair. I&#x27;m natural with probably 4B hair type. My hair is bushy but very soft and easy to comb/brush through. I think it&#x27;s 4B because there is not much curl pattern to my hair unless I define the curls which I don&#x27;t have time for. I just wash, apply conditioner and oil then gel. rap my hair and sit under the dryer for and hour or let it airdry.</li>
    <li> It was what I ordered however the teeth are to short for my hair length. It is not the fault of the seller.</li>
    <li> This is the only styling tool I use for styling and maintaining my curly hair. I recommend this brush for all types if curly curls.</li>
    <li> This brush came recommended by my barber.  Having stiff Asian hair, I&#x27;m able to give some bulk to my hair as well as part it as I wish.  Very practical brush which is just the right size.</li>
    <li> X everything went according to plan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this hair brush since elementary days!</li>
    <li> Definitely travel size, I&#x27;m not sure it would be adequate for really thick or curly hair but for my moderately thick, straight-ish-wavy-ish hair, it&#x27;s a good travel brush.</li>
    <li> Love Denman hairbrushes -- have used them for years and years.</li>
    <li> great brush, just smaller than I thought it would be.  Got my hair cut very short so it a worked out.</li>
    <li> It was a very cheap version of what I remember them to be.</li>
    <li> This brush is a lot smaller than I expected. It&#x27;s not the regular size Denman. This smaller brush&#x27;s bristles are too close to each other for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I eventually purchased the regular sized 9-row brush and removed 4 rows.&lt;br /&gt;I have 4a textured hair and I use the bigger brush on my damp hair, section by section AFTER I finger detangle.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this small brush I had purchased to my mom. She has 3b/3c hair and it works great for her!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush especially  for my daughter because she has thick natural hair and its works excellent on her hair. Great Buy</li>
    <li> Not good for kinky hair at all. I&#x27;ve been using this brush a while and my it tangles my hair and pulls it out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;ve been finger combing my hair with better results. Hopefully my thick hair will come back. This brush as thinned it out a lot. I am not happy. Hair type is 3c/4a.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best I have ever used for my natural hair!!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  I&#x27;ve had short hair for sometime but have continued using my old standby round brushes to style it.

    <li> love these brushes. great for natural hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a young mixed race woman and its hard to find good brushes for thick hair like mine. My mom has used this style of brush for years and has used it on my hair. I moved away recently and needed a new brush for myself. You don&#x27;t really find this brand of brush at regular stores except for at places like Sally beauty. I ordered it on here at amazon and loved the quick delivery and the brush works great for my thick hair. Love it.

    <li> I love the brush but wished I would have purchased and larger one. One great thing about this brush is that it can replace a comb. It doesn&#x27;t tangle the hair and helps to remove tangles as our hair is very curly. I highly recommend it but purchase a larger one.</li>
