      <li>I really am glad i found it!</li>

      <li>I needed something that would moisturize without breaking me out, and still actually be effective as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>so I guess it works nicely on her skin. :)</li>
      <li>The pore therapy removed pimples within two days at the most.</li>
      <li>Her skin has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>My bank really appreciates that lol.</li>
      <li>I bought this with the pore therapy toner &amp; love it</li>

      <li>All these lead to wonder how genuine this product is.</li>
      <li>Nice addition to the Normal to oily Clenziderm set which can be drying.</li>
      <li>Originally I bought this product for my daughter.  </li>
      <li>I have an original bottle that was purchased at my dermatologists office.</li>
      <li>The price here is a lot more reasonable than if I would have bought it from my dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>pretty good, skin isn&#x27;t super clear and have been using it for quite some time (3+ months)</li>

      <li>It is oil free and very light,but also very moisturizing at the same time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the product as much as the packaging (or lack thereof) and shipping.</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding good products that do not irritate my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I bought it to prevent my face from cracking/drying up after using the Obagi Clenziderm Set (Normal to Oily).</li>
      <li>She has very sensitive skin and nothing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is authentic.</li>
      <li>Secondly, this product settled at the bottom of the container, I had to shake well before I got the real content, is this normal?</li>
      <li>I am 27 and struggle with acne since about 19 years old.</li>
      <li>A bit of history - I am an adult, and I have acne prone, sensitive, combination skin.</li>
      <li>I currently have a regimen that works very well</li>
      <li>It is super gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting or itch upon application, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Sensitive enough for my skin!  </li>
      <li>Not sure it is true Obagi formula</li>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful. I suggest using the whole kit.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, gives my skin perfect moisture and there&#x27;s no smell to it.  Sensitive enough for my skin!  No breakouts either.</li>
    <li> My daughter swears by this stuff! She loves it, and she IS beautiful...so I guess it works nicely on her skin. :)</li>
    <li> it was really not packed well and the bottle was open when I got it. hope it is not a used one.</li>
    <li> This product has cleared up my skin! I spent hundreds of dollars at a dermatologist before I found this. I have ordered it repeatedly and will not be without it!</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with acne for two years. After using this daily, my face has improved significantly!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommended it. I have a lot of acne on my face. Using obagi did not help at all. I did not see any difference on my face. Waste of my money. I&#x27;m not sure this is authentic.</li>
    <li> pretty good, skin isn&#x27;t super clear and have been using it for quite some time (3+ months)</li>
    <li> The Obagi Clenziderm lotion arrived without a cap on it.  Who knows if it&#x27;s full or not!  Also, the pump doesn&#x27;t work correctly.  It&#x27;s not the product as much as the packaging (or lack thereof) and shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product-use it twice daily! I add in a retinol A cream a few nights a week and this works perfectly as a carrier for the treatment. I have used this for 2 years with satisfaction every time</li>
    <li> Originally I bought this product for my daughter.  She has very sensitive skin and nothing seemed to work.  This product along with the cleanser works great.  Her skin has never looked better.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is not the usual cream moisturiser. It is in liquid, transparent form. I bought it to prevent my face from cracking/drying up after using the Obagi Clenziderm Set (Normal to Oily). It works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Not sure it is true Obagi formula</li>
    <li> Great product great price</li>
    <li> I have an original bottle that was purchased at my dermatologists office. I purchased these believing I was getting the same product (same labeling, etc.) and the ingredients are NOT the same. This is a knock off. So, everything you see is the same except for the ingredients...</li>
    <li> Love how this feels on my skin! Nice addition to the Normal to oily Clenziderm set which can be drying.</li>
    <li> This is perhaps the best night lotion I have ever owned. A bit of history - I am an adult, and I have acne prone, sensitive, combination skin. I have tried probably a zillion products to try to combat my issues, both OTC and prescription. I needed something that would moisturize without breaking me out, and still actually be effective as a moisturizer. This lotion fits the bill! I currently have a regimen that works very well: I use a Peter Thomas Roth glycolic acid cleanser with my clarisonic, exfoliate weekly with a Clinique scrub, use a dermalogica lotion during the day, and layer this moisturizer with a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide treatment by Dermalogica at night. Acne? Nowhere to be found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: This moisturizes *really* well without breaking me out. It helps combat dryness from the BP treatment. It has a ton of glycerin, which acts as a skin protectant, and is great for skin that has been treated with any type of drying, acne product. It is super gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting or itch upon application, and a little goes a long way. I have been using it for a year and am only on my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The amount of glycerin in this lotion makes it unsuitable for daytime use underneath makeup. You *will* look shiny if you use this during the day. It will not necessarily be shininess from oil - just a sheen from the lotion. If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, or you intend to use it as I do in the evenings, it is really wonderful.</li>
    <li> Obagi helps my skin stay hydrated and not get oily. This helps prevent acne. It also keeps an even complexion.</li>
    <li> First of all, I just realized this product does not exist on the official obagi website. Secondly, this product settled at the bottom of the container, I had to shake well before I got the real content, is this normal? There was no instruction to shake well before use. Thirdly, I expected the product to come in a box with instructions but it came in a ziploc, sealed with tape in an envelope. All these lead to wonder how genuine this product is.</li>
    <li> I love that this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily after I put it on.  I bought this with the pore therapy toner &amp; love it, I will DEFINITELY be buying this again when I run out.  The price here is a lot more reasonable than if I would have bought it from my dermatologist.  My bank really appreciates that lol.</li>
    <li> I love the product item but I&#x27;m missing the straw for the pump.  So, it ended up not using the pump.  It&#x27;s hard to get the lotion out of the container.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Obagi pore therapy, toner,  therapuetic moisturizer; all items worked wonders together. I noticed a changed in my complexion in two weeks. The pore therapy removed pimples within two days at the most. After all the numeral products that I have used, I have found one that truly works.</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot.I am 27 and struggle with acne since about 19 years old.I have a hard time finding good products that do not irritate my sensitive acne prone skin.I started the clenziderm system and this is the only product i will continue to repurchase.It is oil free and very light,but also very moisturizing at the same time.I actually just had a vitalize peel and used it to soothe my dry flaking skin!I have no irritation what so ever.I have been using this product for 1 year.If you are sensitive,dry,congested,or acne prone it is a good product to have.I really am glad i found it!</li>
    <li> If you have just had a peel done this will help heal your skin.  I love it!!!!  Amazing product!!!! I have healed in half the time due to this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product for years. It&#x27;s the best product over the counter for acne treatment.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for over three years.  It&#x27;s lightweight and perfect for my oily complexion.  It also works well when the weather is dry and takes cares of flaky skin.</li>
