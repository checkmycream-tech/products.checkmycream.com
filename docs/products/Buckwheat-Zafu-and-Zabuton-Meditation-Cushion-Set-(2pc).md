### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This zafu and zabuton purchase was the best decision.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>Awesome product, purchased this for my son for his bday</li>
      <li>Great delivery, great product would purchase again from this seller.</li>
      <li>Amazing what a difference a good Zafu and Zabuton make!</li>
      <li>and he loved it.</li>
      <li>Really good for posture.</li>
      <li>Good, comfy fabric.</li>
      <li>The zafu and zabuton give good support and positioning for zazen.</li>
      <li>What can I say, but this helps me meditate a lot better and longer!</li>
      <li>Peace &amp; Light!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and the zabuton fits my legs nicely.</li>
      <li>It is also really nice looking to create a meditation space in my home.</li>
      <li>but I had difficulty with pain, cramping in my ankles and feet and the cushion seemed to warm up a bit.  </li>
      <li>Nice product for the price.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable I love it</li>
      <li>I love my zafu and pad and use them every day for meditation.  </li>
      <li>This set will surely do just that.</li>
      <li>Makes meditating even more of a . . .</li>
      <li>Love these and they dramatically help with my posture and comfort when meditating.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get into padmasana yet as this would definitely complete the requirements to ideal practice, but it&#x27;s so incredibly different and perfect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will get better with time.</li>
      <li>Although most find that a stool is more comfortable for kneeling meditation, I like putting the cushion in between my calves and butt.</li>
      <li>It makes my practice all the more comfortable.</li>
      <li>but after I was able to sit comfortably.  </li>
      <li>Cloth material does attract a lot of dust for some reason, but you can easily unzip the cover to wash and use lent roller for the Zafu.</li>
      <li>Excellent and well worth the money since I&#x27;ll be using it daily!</li>
      <li>The fabric cleans easily and can be decorated with fabric pens.</li>
      <li>I was reluctant due to the price and cheaper versions being available but this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable, quality, spot-on with the color.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product if you are disciplined to practice meditation everyday...</li>
      <li>I feel stable, grounded as well as comfortable while meditating.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comfortable pull off Burmese.</li>
      <li>A must have for begginer and advanced meditators.  </li>
      <li>My wife had a cotton filled Zafu which helped some</li>
      <li>I would recommend the buckwheat over the cotton filled Zafu.    </li>
      <li>The Zafu and Zabuton work well, but I&#x27;m just not so sure they were worth the price.</li>
      <li>This allows my toes and foot to be in a much more natural position.  </li>
      <li>Right now it hurts a bit to sit on.</li>
      <li>Much more comfortable for my knees and the extra support for my legs really helped my feet and ankles since I leave them hanging over the cushion just a tad.  </li>
      <li>Overall, a nice set that should last for many years.</li>
      <li>so i had to empty some of the buckwheat hulls out to be able to sit comfortably (1 gallon bag)</li>
      <li>I do like this somewhat tougher, taller zafu more than the softer, shorter ones I&#x27;ve sat on in various temples.</li>
      <li>The Zafu is filled completely up</li>
      <li>and in this case, it was a pretty hefty price for a pillow and mat.</li>
      <li>I feel like a better price could be found for similar quality, but I don&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>At 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;, this is more than enough to provide cushion for my legs.</li>
      <li>Exactly what it seems in the listing.  </li>
      <li>Extremely firm zafu and very light and comfortable zabuton.</li>
      <li>However, it is very realistic for keeping in your room, and I actually really like it for kneeling meditation.  </li>
      <li>It really helps.</li>
      <li>As a result I find myself really looking forward to meditation.    </li>
      <li>It seems ironic to spend so much money</li>
      <li>This cushion set has really helped in my meditation practice.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I found that the buckwheat really helps with moving sweat and heat out from sitting.  </li>
      <li>With this Zafu I can pull a very comfortable quarter to half lotus, whereas the cushions at the Zendo</li>
      <li>This subtracts considerably from my pain level and I am very glad I spent the extra money on this product.</li>
      <li>Incredibly high quality cushions.</li>
      <li>Needed something a little more permanent than my &amp;#34;blanket on the floor&amp;#34; method of meditation.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Zafu and Zabuton everyday for my meditation periods, and I just love it.</li>
      <li>if very firm and very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>But as long as this is a rare indulgence, I suppose it&#x27;s alright.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been practicing meditation for a few years only, and have only meditated on the ground which I thought was good.</li>
      <li>I was struggling with finding a comfortable position, laying down promoted napping and sitting on the floor or chair</li>
      <li>The Zafu is thick and firm, which is great for someone like me who doesnt want a Zafu that just squishes and lets my rear end sink toward the ground.</li>
      <li>The meditation cushion was softer but had enough bulk to really support my legs.  </li>
      <li>As a courtesy the zafu comes overstuffed with buckwheat hulls so you can remove as much as you like and save them for later</li>
      <li>Well made and soft.</li>
      <li>Its worth the money, however, because I sit daily and this will last for quite a while.</li>
      <li>This makes a huge difference for my Zazen practice and I would highly recommend to anyone who is trying to sit longer, has hard floors or any type of back pain.  </li>
      <li>I have been meditating on and off for years, but lately I have re-dedicated myself to the practice and regularly sit for 30 min or more.  </li>
      <li>The zafu is very firm and is pretty high.</li>
      <li>is because it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>

<li> everything was done professionally no problems, would recommend to all my friends nothing else to add, will buy from you in the future</li>
<li> You can take out the stuffing and adjust the size of the pillow, expensive, but worth it if you use it daily/a few times a week consistently.</li>
<li> High quality design, durable, very firm but supple.</li>
<li> The zafu is a little stiff out of the box, but I&#x27;m sure it will get broken in with time.</li>
<li> was not very conducive.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, pain might very well be a part of Zazen, but having tools that allow you to hold your posture are invaluable.</li>
<li> Firm but not too firm.</li>
<li> Just rock for a few seconds before you practice, and over time you wont even notice it.</li>
<li> Before getting the cushion set, it would sometimes be painful on my back and neck, because I could not get the proper posture I needed.</li>
<li> but that&#x27;s the hard part.</li>
<li> Just a note, it was weird for a few days sitting in it</li>
<li> I have relatively inflexible hips.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and this mat is not great for seated meditation.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;re a meditator without a cushion, start with this one and you wont go wrong.</li>

    <li> Nice product for the price.</li>
    <li> Well made and soft. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and the zabuton fits my legs nicely. The zafu is very firm and is pretty high. Right now it hurts a bit to sit on. I&#x27;m hoping it will get better with time. Overall, a nice set that should last for many years.</li>

Although most find that a stool is more comfortable for kneeling meditation, I like putting the cushion in between my calves and butt.</li>
    <li> The Zafu and Zabuton work well, but I&#x27;m just not so sure they were worth the price. I feel like a better price could be found for similar quality, but I don&#x27;t know. It seems ironic to spend so much money that something that is supposed to harbor modesty. But as long as this is a rare indulgence, I suppose it&#x27;s alright.  I do like this somewhat tougher, taller zafu more than the softer, shorter ones I&#x27;ve sat on in various temples. I have relatively inflexible hips. I occasionally swipe a lint roller over it, but I&#x27;m anal sometimes.</li>
    <li> I love my zafu and pad and use them every day for meditation.  The only reason  I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
    <li> The zafu and zabuton give good support and positioning for zazen. Firm but not too firm. The fabric cleans easily and can be decorated with fabric pens.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable I love it</li>
    <li> Incredibly high quality cushions. As a courtesy the zafu comes overstuffed with buckwheat hulls so you can remove as much as you like and save them for later</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been practicing meditation for a few years only, and have only meditated on the ground which I thought was good. This changed all that. I can&#x27;t get into padmasana yet as this would definitely complete the requirements to ideal practice, but it&#x27;s so incredibly different and perfect. Just a note, it was weird for a few days sitting in it but it molds to you. Just rock for a few seconds before you practice, and over time you wont even notice it. If you&#x27;re a meditator without a cushion, start with this one and you wont go wrong.</li>
    <li> and in this case, it was a pretty hefty price for a pillow and mat. Its worth the money, however, because I sit daily and this will last for quite a while.</li>

    <li> This cushion set has really helped in my meditation practice. I feel stable, grounded as well as comfortable while meditating. Before getting the cushion set, it would sometimes be painful on my back and neck, because I could not get the proper posture I needed. That has all been taken care of with the Zafu &amp; Zabuton cushion set. A must have for begginer and advanced meditators.  Peace &amp; Light!!</li>
    <li> If you practice Shikantaza in the spirit of Dainin Katigiri this is your Zafu &amp; Zabuton.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Zafu and Zabuton everyday for my meditation periods, and I just love it. It makes my practice all the more comfortable. It is also really nice looking to create a meditation space in my home.</li>
    <li> What can I say, but this helps me meditate a lot better and longer! Excellent and well worth the money since I&#x27;ll be using it daily!</li>
    <li> You can take out the stuffing and adjust the size of the pillow, expensive, but worth it if you use it daily/a few times a week consistently. Good, comfy fabric.</li>
    <li> Excellent product if you are disciplined to practice meditation everyday...but that&#x27;s the hard part. Cloth material does attract a lot of dust for some reason, but you can easily unzip the cover to wash and use lent roller for the Zafu. Really good for posture.</li>
    <li> High quality design, durable, very firm but supple. The Zafu is thick and firm, which is great for someone like me who doesnt want a Zafu that just squishes and lets my rear end sink toward the ground. With this Zafu I can pull a very comfortable quarter to half lotus, whereas the cushions at the Zendo I can&#x27;t comfortable pull off Burmese. Amazing what a difference a good Zafu and Zabuton make! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, pain might very well be a part of Zazen, but having tools that allow you to hold your posture are invaluable. This set will surely do just that. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This zafu and zabuton purchase was the best decision. It really helps.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, purchased this for my son for his bday and he loved it. Great delivery, great product would purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I was reluctant due to the price and cheaper versions being available but this is perfect.  The Zafu is filled completely up so i had to empty some of the buckwheat hulls out to be able to sit comfortably (1 gallon bag) but after I was able to sit comfortably.

    <li> I have been meditating on and off for years, but lately I have re-dedicated myself to the practice and regularly sit for 30 min or more.  I was struggling with finding a comfortable position, laying down promoted napping and sitting on the floor or chair was not very conducive.  My wife had a cotton filled Zafu which helped some but I had difficulty with pain, cramping in my ankles and feet and the cushion seemed to warm up a bit.  The Buckwheat Zafu if very firm and very comfortable.  I found that the buckwheat really helps with moving sweat and heat out from sitting.  I would recommend the buckwheat over the cotton filled Zafu.    The meditation cushion was softer but had enough bulk to really support my legs.  Much more comfortable for my knees and the extra support for my legs really helped my feet and ankles since I leave them hanging over the cushion just a tad.  This allows my toes and foot to be in a much more natural position.  As a result I find myself really looking forward to meditation.    Ordering, delivery and &#x27;installation&#x27; was a snap.  Over all if you are looking for a zafu cushion combination I found this one to be quality.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a present for my daughter who loves it. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a meditation cushion.</li>
    <li> everything was done professionally no problems, would recommend to all my friends nothing else to add, will buy from you in the future</li>
    <li> Extremely firm zafu and very light and comfortable zabuton. Seems well made. Makes meditating even more of a . . . whatever it is.</li>
