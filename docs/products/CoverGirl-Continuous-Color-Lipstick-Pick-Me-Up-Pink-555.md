      <li>I needed this color to round out my pink love.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m disappointed that Cover Girl decided to discontinue Pick-Me-Up-Pink, as I&#x27;ve used it for years and have always been happy with it.</li>

This color is my very favorite color so I have found that Amazon is the only place I can get and not get ripped off by the high prices of a discontinued item.

    <li> Thank goodness I can still find this color.  CoverGirl has the best lipstick.  I tried L&#x27;Oreal and it is so sticky and waxy.  Yuck.  This one is almost like a lip stain so even if you eat a meal, you still have some nice color on your lips when you are finished that can last you all day.  I wish I could still find this locally but they don&#x27;t seem to stock much CoverGirl lipstick at the stores near me.  This is my favorite brand and color.</li>
