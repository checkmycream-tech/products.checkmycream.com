      <li>but it&#x27;s very classy and reserved.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the lasting scents with the cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been buying lately not just from Amazon but other so-called fragrance stores I&#x27;ve bought from also.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ll just go back to my &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; and buy from the store down the street.</li>
<li> Just as expected.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> and I remember putting a little on in morning, a very little, and the scent would last for hours, but not now.</li>
<li> A small amount wont last but a little while, so you have to keep applying.</li>
<li> I wish I would have checked reviews before I spend a lot of money on watered down junk.</li>
<li> Have tried a lot of RL fragrances and think I have a winner hear - not too heavy and not too fancy for everyday.</li>
<li> I bought a bottle of Polo Sport some years ago along with Polo (green bottle)</li>
<li> Longevity and projection is mediocre.</li>

    <li> Not sure if this product is authentic; it is cheap, but does not smell like the sample Ralph Lauren tester at my local Macy store; very disappointed with this purchase since I bought not one but two</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my step dad he loved it n loved the scent myself</li>
    <li> After reading feedback on many of the cologne&#x27;s and reading about counterfeits bottles, I think I was taken. Of course, I read after I buy. But I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the lasting scents with the cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been buying lately not just from Amazon but other so-called fragrance stores I&#x27;ve bought from also. I bought a bottle of Polo Sport some years ago along with Polo (green bottle) and I remember putting a little on in morning, a very little, and the scent would last for hours, but not now. A small amount wont last but a little while, so you have to keep applying. That&#x27;s ridicules now with the price you pay for cologne now. This cologne is great but buyer beware I guess, like I said, it&#x27;s just not Amazon but I&#x27;ve bought from others too. I&#x27;ll just go back to my &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; and buy from the store down the street. I wish I would have checked reviews before I spend a lot of money on watered down junk.</li>
    <li> Very nice cologne, not too strong. Smells really good</li>

    <li> nice for traveling, just the right size</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Smells great! Right size. Packaging was good.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my daddy a get well gift and he loves it he said it&#x27;s better then the blue one and he loves the blue one good buy for me...</li>
    <li> My younger son likes this fragrance and I thought that I would buy it and put it in his Easter Basket this year. I smells great!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, my husband loves it</li>
    <li> My son loved this for Christmas!  It smells very clean and nice on him without being too much or over powering.</li>
    <li> I went to the mall with some girls and we went in Sapphora and started smelling the me&#x27;ns colognes. I picked this one off the shelf and all the girls thought it smelt amazing. I was going to buy it but it was $63. Went immediately into Amazon and bought it for $38 with a $7.15 gift card I had remaining from a prior purchase. Excellenct cologne and great for picking up women!</li>
    <li> I have used Polo for many years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used Polo Sport. I really like it and I think I might like it even better than the original Poloi</li>
    <li> I love polo blue and this sport lasts longer. The cologne smells good and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This fragrance isn&#x27;t anything special. It is a very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; and refreshing scent. Longevity and projection is mediocre. I feel like this fragrance is better suited for a 25 year old gentleman or older. All in all, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> Outstanding fragrance!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this version of Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Blue Sport. Thought is would be &#x27;sweet&#x27; smelling but it&#x27;s very classy and reserved. Ralph Lauren hit it out the park with Polo Blue and took it up a notch with this version.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
    <li> Women can&#x27;t resist this smell....AMAZING !</li>
    <li> Not much to say but love this cologne and so does my wife. Smells great and lasts a very long time. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Excelent service. I bought it again. Deserve those stars</li>
    <li> Smells very good! Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> First time the bottle was faulty but got a replacement shipped within a couple of days of my complain. Second one arrived and this time it was perfecto, loving the scent, has great comments from my lady friends about it.</li>
    <li> Great deal 1/2 of store price</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Am allergic to some Polo colognes but not this one.  Doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; as many newer colognes tend to do.</li>
    <li> Smells terrific - I get compliments on it all the time.  I got a different box than in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually more similar to the department store packaging.  I don&#x27;t doubt the authenticity.</li>
