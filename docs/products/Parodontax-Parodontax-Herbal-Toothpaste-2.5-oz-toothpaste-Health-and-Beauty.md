      <li>Good Product I love it, Good Product I love it</li>
      <li>They were absolute wonderful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that Amazon has begun carrying it, since it means I&#x27;ll no longer have to twist people&#x27;s arms to fill their suitcases with tubes of toothpaste on their way home.</li>
      <li>Good Product I love it;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>Product I love it, Good Product I love it.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste are very fine.</li>
      <li>And if you order it and don&#x27;t like it you can always send it to me. :)</li>
      <li>But I can report that I&#x27;m glad it sent me searching for this</li>
      <li>I am satisfied</li>
      <li>Product I love it,</li>
      <li>but it has a nice texture and taste and you don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
      <li>I have been looking forward to get this, i am really happy with the results, helped my sensetive gum big time.</li>
      <li>I used it for a long time with excellent results and I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Is this true or b.s. ?</li>
      <li>We will be carting it in the suitcases very soon :)</li>
      <li>Super toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Buying this from the US is going to cost you far more than any toothpaste available here, but</li>
      <li>Even if this toothpaste seems pricey, it is worth every penny, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>My advise try it, it worth its price.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find any other toothpaste as good as Parodontax.</li>
      <li>I first learned about Parodontax through reading a Mayo research paper - not through marketing or advertising.</li>
      <li>Tastes terrible the first few times you use it, even somewhat salty, but it does leave your mouth refreshed and your teeth nice and smooth and within 2 days my bleeding gums stopped bleeding so I effectively fooled the dental hygienist because she thought my gums were very healthy and really good.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is designed to heal problems with gums, specially paradonthosis, it is all natural, no sweeteners added.</li>
      <li>It really improve strengths of my teeth.</li>
      <li>I am 84 and thanks to it</li>
      <li>Paradontax is really a very  different toothpaste, ueber-clean, very teeth and gum friendly.</li>
      <li>taste - slightly salty and non foamability took some getting used to, but now I love the toothpaste.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s because the baking soda is its main ingredient.</li>
      <li>Anyway, the price is TOOOOOO high.</li>
      <li>And it seems to leave my teeth much cleaner, with a lasting clean, and with less white paste to clean from my sink.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>Everything the other reviewers say is true.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfy with toothpaste,but next time I  would like to see instructions in</li>
      <li>Very effective but too expensive!</li>
      <li>even when acquiring it took a major effort.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It starts out tasting very strong and very odd, because it&#x27;s spicy and not sweet at all.  </li>
      <li>because after 3 days of trying this toothpaste, I think I will from this point forward always look for either this exact toothpaste, or other sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)- free toothpaste, which is very hard to find.</li>
      <li>But with no other toothpaste I had such sense of cleaniness</li>

    <li> Excellent result-noticed improvement+comfort after cleaning+reduction in accumulation of dirt+ sensitivity reduction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cannot afford price</li>
    <li> Needless to say about quality. Can&#x27;t find any other toothpaste as good as Parodontax. Anyway, the price is TOOOOOO high. For this price, I can tell someone from my country in another half of the world to send me a 5 ounce one.</li>
    <li> Parodontax is a great product, there is no question about it. I used it for a long time with excellent results and I highly recommend it.  However, do not expect to get it from smallflowers. This tooth paste is out of stock for a long time already, and it will no be in for at least next three weeks. Information on Amazon about its availability is incorrect. Currently smallflower cannot deliver Parodontax.</li>
    <li> Tastes like dirt! I used this once and tossed it.</li>
    <li> Even if this toothpaste seems pricey, it is worth every penny, in my opinion.It is based on herbal extracts and sea salt, no gimmicks, it is pink in color. You can buy it for c.$3 in European Union, including recent members of the EU, in case you visit, just ask for it at pharmacies, as it is considered medicated toothpaste. This toothpaste is designed to heal problems with gums, specially paradonthosis, it is all natural, no sweeteners added. It is sea salt based, and you will need some short time to get used to it. But with no other toothpaste I had such sense of cleaniness like  when using this one. Got hooked and now is difficult to use any other brand (except Ajona from Germany, difficult to get). Paradontax is really a very  different toothpaste, ueber-clean, very teeth and gum friendly. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Paradontax toothpaste exclusively since 1985, even when acquiring it took a major effort.  I&#x27;m thrilled that Amazon has begun carrying it, since it means I&#x27;ll no longer have to twist people&#x27;s arms to fill their suitcases with tubes of toothpaste on their way home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 22 years, I&#x27;ve had no gingivitis, no cavities, all good teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It starts out tasting very strong and very odd, because it&#x27;s spicy and not sweet at all.  But it grows on you and after a couple of weeks everything else tastes like brushing your teeth with sugar icing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great toothpaste! And if you order it and don&#x27;t like it you can always send it to me. :)</li>
    <li> Super toothpaste.  Not &amp;#34;ultra-sweet&amp;#34; but &amp;#34;ultra-clean&amp;#34;!!</li>
    <li> I have very weak gum. As soon as I leave this toothpaste, my gum problems start again. This toothpaste is the cure for my gum. My advise try it, it worth its price.</li>
    <li> I have been looking forward to get this, i am really happy with the results, helped my sensetive gum big time. I am satisfied</li>
    <li> I found this blog post:    [...]    It basically says that its a prescription-only toothpaste, should only be used for a short time and can change the colour of your teeth..    Is this true or b.s. ?</li>
    <li> I am very satisfy with toothpaste,but next time I  would like to see instructions in English or Spanish sorry I don&#x27;t speak German.  The toothpaste are very fine. Thank you for your help.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this the last 4 years we buy it from Bangkok. I think its made in Thailand but branded in germany. The stock finally ran out recently and quite immediately the bleeding gums problem returned. We will be carting it in the suitcases very soon :)</li>
    <li> Buying this from the US is going to cost you far more than any toothpaste available here, but WOW! The difference is amazing. WARNING : the taste is disgusting.</li>
    <li> Parodontax is a very good product. It has helpd me to keep my gums and teeth in a wonderful condition. I am 84 and thanks to it my teeth are good and my gums never have sores</li>
    <li> Wonderful toothpaste. Tastes terrible the first few times you use it, even somewhat salty, but it does leave your mouth refreshed and your teeth nice and smooth and within 2 days my bleeding gums stopped bleeding so I effectively fooled the dental hygienist because she thought my gums were very healthy and really good. Remarkable product. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who had a hard time with bleeding gums.</li>
    <li> Everything the other reviewers say is true. I started using the toothpaste when I was visiting Thailalnd and I hoarded it in my suitcase when I returned to the US. I&#x27;m down to the last bits so I hope a US distributor can be found. You may think I&#x27;m crazy but I will (unwillingly) pay $12 a tube, even though the price is outrageous. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Good Product I love it, Good Product I love it&lt;br /&gt;Good Product I love it, Good Product I love it;&lt;br /&gt;Good Product I love it, Good Product I love it.</li>
    <li> My lips were permanently chapped using the US commercial brands of toothpaste. I read someplace about how sodium laurel sulfate can aggravate chapping and decided to look for a toothpaste which had none of that. Don&#x27;t bother - they all do.  Parodontax doesn&#x27;t and I have had no chapped lips since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste - slightly salty and non foamability took some getting used to, but now I love the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Very effective but too expensive!</li>
    <li> Product is very expensive and I did not feel any noticable difference after using it,  I will not order it again as it is a waste of money.  lesson learned..</li>
    <li> They were absolute wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really improve strengths of my teeth.</li>
    <li> I would give 5 star for the toothpaste but it is way too pricey. Great toothpaste. It&#x27;s taste is not great but that&#x27;s because the baking soda is its main ingredient.</li>
    <li> Yes, the price is way above what you normally pay for a tube of toothpaste; but in this case it is a little bit of money for a bit difference. I first learned about Parodontax through reading a Mayo research paper - not through marketing or advertising. I tried to go back and find the paper, to link to it here, but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t refound it yet. So I&#x27;m not going to reference anything specific from the article, at risk of getting it wrong. But I can report that I&#x27;m glad it sent me searching for this because after 3 days of trying this toothpaste, I think I will from this point forward always look for either this exact toothpaste, or other sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)- free toothpaste, which is very hard to find. Studies have proven that SLS causes damage to the oral tissues. I like to brush after every meal and snack. So I think that damage can add up. SLS is the ingredient that makes toothpaste, and other detergents, foam. So you don&#x27;t get foam - but it has a nice texture and taste and you don&#x27;t need as much. And it seems to leave my teeth much cleaner, with a lasting clean, and with less white paste to clean from my sink.</li>
