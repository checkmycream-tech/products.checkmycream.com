      <li>This is much cheaper than buying it from the store..</li>
      <li>This concealer is very cakey.  </li>
      <li>Better than any other Concealer I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>Not sure how this product is even considered a concealer; it is even more shear than my foundation.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t stay on the entire day and was very oil, which made my face feel oily too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got an old bottle or what happened, but it does not conceal well and clumps up even when you use a tiny amount.  </li>
      <li>As I get older and move on to more expensive foundations, primers, and powders, I keep coming back to this</li>

<li> It does it&#x27;s job and can even conceal my deep, dark undereye circles.  </li>
<li> Does not cover dark spots at all, even with multiple applications.</li>
<li> So fair that the area under my eyes look like I have a couple of shiners or am undergoing a horrible cancer treatment.</li>
<li> It blends in well with my other makeup and the tube lasts forever!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and will continue to do so.</li>
<li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this product is the fake chrome on the container.</li>
<li> It does not conceal the dark circles and makes it worse and visible.</li>
<li> I have been using this concealer for at least 15 years.  </li>
<li> It is too bad I can&#x27;t return an opened cosmetic to the drugstore.</li>
<li> What a horrible disappointment!  </li>

    <li> this worked great lasted all day and i loved how it was in a tube that was good . i loved how you could put it anywhere like in your pocket because it was in a little tube. the conclealer works great it was a good price i paid to</li>
    <li> Good to carry in your purse</li>
    <li> I have been using this concealer for at least 15 years.  As I get older and move on to more expensive foundations, primers, and powders, I keep coming back to this concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild to moderate breakouts and this concealers covers beautifully.  Its easy to put on and relatively cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting it on before or after foundation does not make much difference in my experience. Staying power is moderate.</li>
    <li> The shade is a little light for my skin, but other than that this product is great! Blends and applies well!</li>
    <li> This concealer is very cakey.  I don&#x27;t know if I got an old bottle or what happened, but it does not conceal well and clumps up even when you use a tiny amount.  So far I have found MAC concealer to be the best in terms of coverage and looking natural.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer. It works good.This is such a good product that conceals like it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This is just what I need I end up with two tubes of this just what I need got it</li>
    <li> It works really well for concealing dark circles an definitely great for blemishes. I&#x27;ve never used concealer before this, I love it!</li>
    <li> Good product that lasts a while. Nothing to rave about. Didn&#x27;t stay on the entire day and was very oil, which made my face feel oily too. (My face is normally only oily in the morning, but that goes away after I wash my face, so it was definitely the product) It is a good buy for the price, though.</li>
    <li> Not as great of coverage as I would like.  Doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone, or blend in without being cakey. Probably wont buy this EVER again. I&#x27;ve bought better stuff than this at drugstores.</li>
    <li> Good product. This is much cheaper than buying it from the store..so I always buy it through you guys. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I accidentally left my regular concealer (Smashbox) at a friend&#x27;s house so I went to the drugstore to buy some concealer until I could get mine back.  What a horrible disappointment!  Not sure how this product is even considered a concealer; it is even more shear than my foundation. Does not cover dark spots at all, even with multiple applications. It is too bad I can&#x27;t return an opened cosmetic to the drugstore. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! You don&#x27;t see it and it hides your blemishes nicely. Better than any other Concealer I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon</li>

    <li> Does not works for me. I am fair but since I am an Indian, so I bought the medium one. It does not conceal the dark circles and makes it worse and visible. Does not cover even the tiniest blemishes on my face. I would never buy that again and I have to find again for perfect concealer</li>
    <li> I had no expectations on this product but it works pretty good!</li>
    <li> Glides smoothly on skin, Works perfectly under the eyes. :) Definitely met my expectations and the price is worth the shot! Try it! :D</li>
    <li> This concealer has a nice creamy texture, itoesn&#x27;t slip,  and it blends very well.  The color is neutral. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Fine concealer. Not as much coverage as I&#x27;d like. But it&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin. So fair that the area under my eyes look like I have a couple of shiners or am undergoing a horrible cancer treatment. I started using concealer, usually Cover Girl, when I hit Junior High. I even take it on camping trips. This is a good concealer.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for covering birthmarks, which is what I use it for.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off easily once I apply it and let it dry, which makes this liquid a better choice than cover sticks.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and will continue to do so.</li>
