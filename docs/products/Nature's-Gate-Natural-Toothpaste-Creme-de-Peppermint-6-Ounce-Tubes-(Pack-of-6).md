<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel so fresh~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine and my friend recommended this one and I tried it and I like this one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am going to continue to use this toothpaste !!!</li>
    <li> Got it for our kids(2 yrs and 6 ys) - who hate &amp;#34;kid flavored&amp;#34; toothpaste but dentist recommends no fluoride, they don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome. Best tooth paste I ever had. No fluoride and it works as well if not better than a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; fluoridated one.</li>
    <li> Natural Gate should have done better to communicate with their consumer whether or not their product is safe to use.</li>
    <li> Simple- Cleans Teeth, Tastes Good, Healthier- nothing unnatural nor fluoride, and the Amazon price is unbeatable. Save yourself hours of research- buy this bulk package.</li>
    <li> Great option for a flouride-free clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lie that fluoride does any good for humans at all. It&#x27;s the active ingredient in rat poison. The local stores have allot of shelve space for tooth paste. But it&#x27;s all the same flouride stuff in different colorfull packages. Under the name &#x27;fluoride&#x27; they can put hundreds of different toxins in their fluoride tooth paste. The peppermint flavor of this toothpaste will take some getting use to.</li>
    <li> Wish it had a more refreshing and lasting taste -but I am  happy with it!</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste it took a while for me to get use to the fact it doesn&#x27;t foam like regular toothpaste does but now im use to it and i prefer it.The peppermint makes it taste the regular commercial toothpaste but with out all the unhealthy stuff in it. its a winner.</li>
    <li> I like the taste and the feel.  I don&#x27;t have to use much.  It is great to know it isn&#x27;t bad for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural fluoride-free toothpaste we have tried!  I bought the 6-pack based on the reviews here.  It tastes great, cleans very well, and I love what it doesn&#x27;t have in it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic  price.  Love this toothpaste.  Typical commercial brands are poison to your system.  Glad we found Natures Gate!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. Best natural one I&#x27;ve found(i&#x27;ve tried some really nasty ones!) Tastes like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste without the worry</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Fresh, herby taste, and vegan-approved.</li>
    <li> GREAT price! I usually buy these at Sprouts for $5-6 so $3 is nice</li>
    <li> Another great toothpaste from Nature&#x27;s Gate. We have pretty clean, healthy teeth in this household. Thank you for making oral hygiene such a pleasant experience!</li>
    <li> Great product. cheaper in amazon than local store.</li>
    <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Cleanliness&lt;br /&gt;Natural&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;I ran out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a natural toothpaste this is the best I have found. It makes my mouth feel clean and unlike other natural toothpastes I don&#x27;t feel like I have been washing with clay or dirt.</li>
    <li> Very good toothpaste at a good price.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to Tom&#x27;s toothpaste, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s not harmful to us human beings and it cleans your teeth very well!  Like it Lots</li>
    <li> We really like this paste. Safe for the whole family, cleans well and tastes great. This flavor (peppermint) is better than the creme de mint.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; I love it. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Does a good job and doesn&#x27;t contain propylene glycol or sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
    <li> We have been buying natural, fluoride-free toothpastes for seven years and we have enjoyed this one.  We still purchase it regularly, and it is the reigning favorite of all our children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It has no fluoride and much more natural ingredients than mainstream toothpastes and even other natural brands.  The mint flavor is understated and does not leave a burning sensation in your mouth, which is one of the reasons why our children prefer it...they say Mommy and Daddy&#x27;s toothpaste is too spicy!  It does foam up, which is nice.  We have tried other natural toothpastes that do not foam at all, and I think those feel strange and are hard to use.  This feels like normal toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I don&#x27;t feel like this brand freshens my mouth as I would like...though our children don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;spicier\\&quot; mint flavor of other toothpastes, my husband and I do, and this one just doesn&#x27;t taste quite strong enough for us.  But, that is absolutely a personal preference and NOT a slam on the product in any way.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tooth paste of all times.  No fluride and it tastes good too.  I have tried many of the natural ones and this is the best!</li>
    <li> Natural toothpaste with no fluoride!  I use it everyday!  Very natural feeling!</li>
    <li> I have tried many natural toothpastes like Jason, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Desert Essence, and so far out of all the ones I tried and liked this one I prefer the best.  It cleans well and gives your mouth more freshness I feel than the others.  You won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> As advertised. Good price. Good service.</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate peppermint, is our family&#x27;s favorite toothpaste. It cleans very well, has no foul aftertaste, and we&#x27;re pleased that it doesn&#x27;t contain that toxic waste, known as fluoride. Arrived fast and as expected. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent shopping experience, super product.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste I use!! Its an excellent brand and great price for the pack of 6 I purchased.  Will purchase again.  Thankds</li>
    <li> My teeth feel much cleaner than with the crest toothpaste I have been using. The taste is much milder, it&#x27;s smooth and I like how the mint flavor is light. I just can&#x27;t believe that I brush less than half as long and use less paste, and I can feel my teeth are cleaner than with crest &amp;#34;baking soda and peroxide&amp;#34; fresh mint. My whole mouth feels like it is cleaner now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many natural toothpastes have been either too chalky or strong flavored to get accustomed easily. Nature&#x27;s Gate did a good job with this product, it is now my favorite. It costs twice as much, but I think it is easy to cut the portions in half and get cleaner teeth.</li>
    <li> Works great, tastes great, and I feel safe using it on my body!!</li>
    <li> I prefer to make my own toothpaste, but I do get busy sometimes, and purchase it instead. I&#x27;m always on the look out for more natural products, but when buying commercially, I don&#x27;t always find exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found Nature&#x27;s Gate to be the safest I could find, and it works for myself as well as my children. Plus, the 6-pack is extremely convenient. The price is good and amazon.com prime 2-day shipping makes the value even better.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has amazing minty scent. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. But I love it because this toothpaste truly non toxic.</li>
    <li> The best non fluoride toothpaste I have used...</li>
    <li> Great brand and great taste</li>
    <li> great taste, great price for a natural toothpaste!  I have bought this product before and will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I got toothpaste and started using it, really like the taste of it. Amazon&#x27;s price is favorable, recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is a great bargain for this toothpaste. 6 tubes. One for each bathroom (2) with some to spare. It&#x27;s never a bad thing to have extra on hand. We like this toothpaste because it is healthy for your teeth and body -- no fluoride, no artificial sweeteners and other abrasive ingredients that so many of the dentist recommended and pushed varieties have.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I love this, we switched to it after reading the ingredients on our usual Crest/Colgate toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant minty taste, keeps the mouth fresh. Texture feels just fine. A great healthy replacement for the usual commercial stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The color is not perfectly white, it is a little dull-ish. I&#x27;ll keep a watch on any mold but so far it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
    <li> Tastes naturally minty and mild, gives that &amp;#34;fresh breath&amp;#34; after affect.  Teeth feel just as clean as using Colgate, Crest, or any other store brand.</li>
    <li> When ordering this product, I just hoped it would taste and work ok.  To my surprise, I love it...I think it cleans better than my former toothpaste, and tastes great.  This will be my toothpaste of choice from now on.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this toothpaste. It makes our breath fresh and mouth feel clean. This is a really good natural toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be like me and buy a case of this.  It lasts longer than I thought it would.  It is really great at cleaning my teeth without cartoon characters wielding mini-scrubber machines, or elves/gnomes.  It also doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride, which the voices inside my head tell me I should avoid.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything you want from toothpaste. Fresh and clean without extra junk. This pack of six allows me to have toothpaste in many locations as well (work, car, bag, etc)</li>
    <li> Toothpaste performs as well as store-bought, and tastes about as decent as you can expect toothpaste to taste. texture is softer than store-bought toothpaste, it&#x27;s more of a cream than a paste, that&#x27;s fine with me though. It leaves teeth sparkling without all the unhealthy chemicals found in commercial brands, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Been using it for three months, unlike another brand - kingfisher -  this one didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive after finishing up first tube. I like how refreshing it is and not as &#x27;abrasive&#x27; as other non-fluor toothpaste. Would definitely recommend it and glad I got 5 more</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s best tooth brush that I have so far.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to my next dentist appt&lt;br /&gt;Great taste, great quality, no yucky baking soda after taste.  Pure and simple.</li>
    <li> I love having no fluoride in my toothpaste. Also the flavor is very agreeable. It shipped on time and arrived intact. How could I not recommend such a great product.</li>
    <li> very good product.  mouth and teeth feel clean. we like this toothpaste very much. great tasting too:) give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste.  I just wish the hole that dispensed was a bit smaller.  Other than that it taste like peppermint candy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got it at my local grocery store. It&#x27;s good that this is a relatively popular product. However, it&#x27;s not as safe as it&#x27;s promoted. It says that it doesn&#x27;t use Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, however it has Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate - another foaming agent! This is hypocrisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using organic Himalaya Neem &amp; Pomegranate toothpaste for about 2 years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003B3OKQ8 Himalaya Herbal Healthcare Neem &amp; Pomegranate Toothpaste, Net Wt. 5.29-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of healthier alternatives to commercialized products that we are unfortunately exposed to by our uninformed parents and peers. I normally go for Tom&#x27;s of Maine products (deodorant) but I noticed this product at a fair price and decided to give it a try. I actually got turned onto this brand when I tried some new herbal shampoo and conditioner from Wholefoods Market. They smell wonderful and have become one of my favorite hair cleaning products. In getting back to reviewing this item, it works well and is not too tasteful. I feel like it sufficiently helps clean my teeth without the gritty texture or funky after taste that some toothpastes have. I will definitely reorder this product again.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to artificial sweeteners.  In toothpaste the sweeteners make my gums bleed.  I have none of that problem with this toothpaste.  Cleans teeth just as good as any commercial brand out there.  Make sure your toothbrush is good.</li>
    <li> Great tasting toothpaste.  Not too minty but does the job.  No fluoride or SLS which was was I didn&#x27;t want in my toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean! And with no unhealthy ingredients :)</li>
    <li> UPDATE (Changed from 5 stars to 1 star): Been using this toothpaste for several years now and loved it until I received a new order yesterday. The packaging has changed dramatically. No big deal, I could care less about the artwork on the packaging. What bothers me is that the formula has obviously changed also. Now it seems to be watered down, has quite a different taste, and leaves your tongue slightly raw with a burning sensation after you use it. Not cool. I will like;y be returning this and searching for a new brand.   I got tired using standard toothpaste. With Colgate or Crest, I always got that weird taste in my mouth after brushing, not to mention my mouth always felt dried out afterwards. While in the process of switching most of my toiletries and cleaning products to natural alternatives, I chose this one and never looked back. It doesn&#x27;t have those chemical effects described above. It&#x27;s refreshing without being too harsh. I also like Nature&#x27;s Gate because it hasn&#x27;t been (at least to my knowledge) bought by some fortune 500 company, like Tom&#x27;s of Maine was bought by Colgate-Palmolive. Screw that noise!</li>
    <li> $25 tube of toothpaste. All because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.  You people are crazy.</li>
    <li> This makes my teeth, gums, and tongue feel minty fresh.  One reason I buy this product is because it has a lot of natural ingredients, no sweetener. no flouride, and no harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> Works good and the best product.</li>
    <li> I unclogged my sink pipes and they were coated in a white substance that had the same consistency of this toothpaste. It seems like this paste is a bit more thick than normal toothpaste and that it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as easily. Try not to let large chucks of it go down the drain without first breaking them down. Other than that I think the toothpaste is great and I love how the flavor of it isn&#x27;t overpowering like other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I feel so much better using a natural toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore about the toxic ingredients in regular toothpaste.  The toothpaste it self is awesome.  Cleans the teeth very well, your teeth feel polished just like a dentist cleaning.  Also leaves your mouth and breath minty fresh!  Love it!</li>
    <li> i was informed about this item so i decided id try it , its not for everyone</li>
    <li> We love this toothpaste.  I wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the packaging, which just made me confused enough to have to call them to make sure it&#x27;s the same product.  The previous packaging was more pleasing to the eye, than the new, in my opinion.  Anyway, it&#x27;s a great product that leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;This allowed me to get my hubby away from Colgate and Crest - that says a lot.  He&#x27;s one that does not like change.</li>
    <li> Taste is nice, not overpowering.  Kids use it without complaint and this is the first time for that with a non name brand.  Moving toward a flouride free home so nice to find a good product.  I like that my teeth feel scrubbed when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste.  The taste is great.  Nice and strong like you can feel it killing all the germs in your mouth immediately.  But it doesn&#x27;t linger and leave a bad aftertaste. Just leaves a fresh mouth.  My dentist commented how much better my gums looked since my last visit.  This was the only change I made after being a life long Colgate user.  I&#x27;m really thrilled with this toothpaste and glad I got the 6 pack.</li>
    <li> Very good product to make your teeth clean and white and your mouth feels fresher longer than regular store brands. Also the price is good too.</li>
    <li> I love the flavor of this toothpaste. It&#x27;s mild and doesn&#x27;t prevent me from eating a meal directly after brushing. That&#x27;s right people, fluoride-free brushing goodness, and orange juice still tastes good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I don&#x27;t feel like I have a chemical factory in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You still have to actually brush your teeth. Just eating this stuff won&#x27;t prevent cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it clean, people. I have to run---toothbrush is calling!</li>
    <li> Very good taste and feeling in your mouth.  Of course if you like mint, which I do.  I feel better using this than the normal tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Our family decided to ditch the flouride and switch to more natural toothpaste. We started by trying Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which we liked well enough. But for our second trial we chose this toothpaste, and it was instantly \\&quot;the winner.\\&quot;  We liked it so much better that we probably will look no further. The taste is wonderful, and the mint is very refreshing. My mouth feels clean for hours afterwards, and there is no bad aftertaste. All the kids like this as well (ages 3-18). The price is fantastic--especially for the amount of toothpaste our family of 8 goes through! I am happy we don&#x27;t need to look any further.</li>
    <li> Used this for a year and a half and just got checked by my dentist, who said I had a cavity--my first in 15 years. Can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s a direct connection, but I&#x27;m brushing just as often (twice a day) and flossing the same or more often. Just putting this out there for others.</li>
    <li> As someone who&#x27;s allergic to sodium lauryl sulfate, I was super happy to finally find a really tasty SLS-free toothpaste. This is it! I&#x27;ve tried and liked a few (Burt&#x27;s Bees) and hated others (Tom&#x27;s), but this is definitely my favorite. It tastes really normal, which can be hard to find with natural toothpastes. Now that I&#x27;ve discovered this 6-pack, I don&#x27;t have to scan the store shelves with my fingers crossed, hunting for the one tube of SLS-free toothpaste they have on hand :)</li>
    <li> Our go-to fluoride free toothpaste for the last three years! This new formula seems a little more runny, though.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good product!</li>
    <li> Product as described. Does not have that sickening sweet taste of regular toothpastes. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Tastes great, doesn&#x27;t have nasty crap in it, wasn&#x27;t expensive when I bought a few at a time, what more can I say...</li>
    <li> Great taste - something that&#x27;s hard to find in a natural toothpaste...</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste for sensitive teeth. I would def recommend this product. And it comes with such a large amount, you&#x27;ll never run out.</li>
    <li> I like the taste of this toothpaste and the fact that it contains no fluoride. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> my son swallows his toothpaste, still trying to work with him.  so with this non-fluoride toothpaste, no worry&#x27;s, and my son likes the taste,&lt;br /&gt;the peppermint taste is fairly stronge at first, but goes away rather quickly</li>
    <li> I never understood how those people in the toothpaste commercials could brush their teeth with nary a trace of evidence. Ever since I was a child, I have tried and failed to keep those foamy peaks of paste in my mouth and off of my face. Fast forward twenty years and I still resemble a rabid raccoon. My point? As a female who has perioral derm and the occasional bout of redness in the nasolabial fold area, I made the switch from traditional pastes, like Colgate and Crest, to Tom&#x27;s. My mouth never felt cleaner or healthier, but I still had issues with the aforementioned. So I investigated all of my products, from lip gloss to face wash, but never considered my toothpaste a culprit until recently. When I read the label on my Tom&#x27;s, it listed SLS, or sodium lauryl sulfate, as an ingredient. Bingo! So I quickly made the switch to Nature&#x27;s Gate after purchasing from my local health food store. Within a week my face looked 95% better, especially the redness. Needless to say, I liked the toothpaste so much that I ordered this 6-pack. Great value. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to the regular toothpastes sold at the supermarkets. I get painful sores in my mouth from them. So I only use toothpaste with natural ingredients without SLS and fluoride. However, not all the natural toothpastes have the minty, fresh feeling after use. This one does, so I&#x27;ve been using it a lot. I buy it at Trader Joe&#x27;s or other retailers some time, but Amazon sells it in bulk and is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Fluoride-free. Good enough for me. It doesn&#x27;t make me puke in the morning like every other toothpaste I try to use. This tastes great and feels even better that it&#x27;s healthier! The dentist&#x27;s don&#x27;t recommend it but then again they weren&#x27;t paid by Nature&#x27;s Gate for supportive reviews like the b.s. in the day when doctors recommended cigarettes.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite toothpaste.  It is great tasting and doesn&#x27;t have all the ingredients we don&#x27;t want that Crest, Colgate, and other &#x27;normal&#x27; toothpastes have such as fluoride, sulfates, triclosan, and artificial additives to list a few. It leaves teeth silky clean.  As far as whitening goes, our teeth are not the whitest, but they aren&#x27;t discolored either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a subscribe and save product that is available off and on - so if you like it as much as we do then ordering it in a six-pack ensures you won&#x27;t have to pay around $5 a tube at the local store.  One seller on Amazon has the audacity to price point it at $9 - for ONE tube - don&#x27;t buy it!  I paid $18.52 for 6 on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Started using this in an effort to use toothpaste with less harmful ingredients. I battle bleeding gums, which I manage to keep at bay with a variety of home remedies. However, when I started using this toothpaste it immediately made my gums bleed more profusely than before, a phenomenon that ceased when I stopped using it. It also leaves my children and I with unsavory-smelling breath, as if we had not even brushed at all, so I fail to believe that it does much of a good job cleaning our mouths. We like Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoos, conditioners, and lotions, but will not use their toothpaste anymore.</li>
    <li> It did not feel to me like it cleaned my teeth well enough. The taste is ok, nothing special.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste contains carrageenan.  Not good.  Wish I&#x27;d known before I ordered it.  I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love all of Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s products. It&#x27;s hard to find vegan toothpaste that is not produced by a company that has been bought out by a large, ethically-murky corporation. To the best of my knowledge, Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s integrity is intact. I hope it remains so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff also tastes surprisingly &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; for an &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; toothpaste. It is very minty, creamy, and delicious ;) It makes me enjoy brushing my teeth, and leaves them feeling extra clean.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, and my teeth feel so clean.  It doesn&#x27;t have all of the crazy chemicals that other brands have, and once you get used to this (which won&#x27;t take but one brushing), you will think that other toothpaste tastes gross.  What a great product.  I do &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27; with my Prime Membership and get a six-pack once every six months.</li>
    <li> We love this toothpaste and buy a lot at once, it is my favorite from all the &#x27;natural&#x27; ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on the teeth.I no longer have gum and teeth sensitivities. Great deal! They are so much more expensive at whole foods.</li>
    <li> No flouride means no aluminum ingested &#x3D; less chance of dementia, etc.  It is being found that aluminum affects the brain and all of the dental ballyhoo about flouride being good for your teeth is to no avail without a clear brain.</li>
    <li> I use baking soda and vinegar, but for the lil&#x27; dude, I bought these. He seems to like using them, maybe too much.</li>
    <li> Excellent all natural product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for three months now, and while it is definitely a natural solution, I haven&#x27;t been impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitivity to artificial sweeteners (including sodium saccharin, sucralose, and xylitol) which triggers migraines for me. Although I figured that toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t have too much of an impact on it, I also wanted to find a toothpaste that wouldn&#x27;t leave me worrying about what would happen if I swallowed some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste seemed very promising for the first couple of months, but I have recently noticed darkening/staining between my teeth that appeared rather suddenly. After using some regular whitening toothpaste I had lying around for a couple of days, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really wanted this toothpaste to work, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job combating stains from things like coffee. If staining is not a problem for you, go with this. However, I&#x27;ll be continuing my search for an effective, natural toothpaste that works to stop stains.</li>
    <li> Just a dab of paste on my brush allows me to brush 18 surfaces [inside and outside of teeth and gums] for 20 seconds per surface.</li>
    <li> The paste foams just as much as regular tooth paste, and its better for you. Theres no need to use a toothpaste with fluoride, sulfates or any other harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I wanted to stop applying as many chemicals as possible to my body. Imagine my surprise when it also made my teeth whiter. Go figure.To me, that makes it worth having to buy an 8-tube pack, which is the caveat. And the lid doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as it should.</li>
    <li> You have to be a superman to get this gel out of the tube.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different toothpastes, and this one won them out. I&#x27;ve been using this consistently now for about 3 yrs. some other toothpastes that are supposed to be healthy for you, would not be as good at simply cleaning teeth, or would leave a residue. But this one really leaves teeth very clean.</li>
    <li> Ugh! This tastes so awful, I had to return it as defective. I thought I would get used to the taste, but, no. . . Just too awful.</li>
    <li> Very well priced, and a very good product.  It leaves a nice clean feeling and it isn&#x27;t harsh on the teeth.</li>
    <li> Not for me. The taste was weird and I did not feel that fresh clean in my mouth.</li>
    <li> great buy for natural tooth paste. I lke the 4 pak it came with&lt;br /&gt;so it lasts awhile and no floride in the product.</li>
    <li> this toothpaste has Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, which is just another version of the toxic Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, and carrageenan is a known carcinogen so even though it is fluoride free which is great, your still absorbing toxins. if your not looking for healthy toothpaste, this is fine, but if healthy, non-toxic toothpaste is your goal, keep diggin. best toothpaste i have found is the young living brand, but it does get expensive. here is a link to a article that tells you what ingredients hide as Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, http://www.naturalnews.com/024527_soap_skin_oil.html.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and buying here is defiinitely better than relying on the local stores!</li>
    <li> Very good toothpaste. Was a Biotene user before that company got bought by a huge multinational and the corporate geniuses decided to change the formula to make it a conventional foamy toothpaste. This is a very nice alternative that is as good as the old Biotene at a cheaper price. It tastes great (minty!), doesn&#x27;t dry out my mouth (the new Biotene does!), and keeps my teeth pearly white.</li>
    <li> We no longer use fluoride--and at first my husband was skeptical thinking we would all get cavities.  Three years later and we are still not using fluoride toothpaste.  This is a great price for this product!</li>
    <li> I Love this toothpaste. I&#x27;m going to re-order another pack.</li>
    <li> I really like the smoothness and texture of this toothpaste. The minty taste is refreshing and the amount seems very fair for what you pay for. Overall a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know if this would be good or not, but read the reviews carefully and took a chance.  Love it!  Have given tubes to my mother and to my daughter--we are are thrilled with this toothpaste.  It tastes great and is not full of chemicals.  A winning combination!</li>
    <li> NO-Flouride option is great!</li>
    <li> All natural flouride free toothpaste! Feels great, smells great, and cleans teeth just as well as any other toothpaste. The fact that this is flouride-free made me buy it and after using it I would not go back to any other toothpaste.</li>
    <li> great product natural very concentrated, excellent delivery service</li>
    <li> third order. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Hello I just bought your Nature&#x27;s Gate Natural Tooth Paste cool mint. # 1 it does not tast like mint. 2 it is so hard the  GEL I can not get it to come out of the tube. I called your # on the back of the tube which is know longer in service. So please tell what is wrong with the prodect. Could you send a replacment or something better or do I need to send you mine. It is Horrible. I have never seen anthing called (gell) and I have a heck of a time getting it out of the tube. How do you stand by your product if I  can not contact you?  Not sure if I will  buy this again.  Lucy Gallardo</li>
    <li> Probably the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste we&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t notice much difference between this and what my wife calls &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; toothpaste--aka crest, colgate, aquafresh, etc. Most other natural toothpastes don&#x27;t seem to freshen breath or clean as well as this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over 10 years.  My daughter has been using it too since she was little, she&#x27;s never had a cavity, and she&#x27;s 21 now!  My hygienist raves over our teeth, we have  no plaque.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for 3 years now without great results. I am happy with the quality of ingredients, and that I can let my child use this toothpaste without being fearful that he could swallow it. My mouth is too sensitive to regular toothpaste. I use to purchase $20 specialty toothpaste from the pharmacy until I discovered this natural gem. Thank you Nature&#x27;s Gate!</li>
    <li> Love this natural tooth paste. It is strong enough to leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean, but is not harsh and I feel good knowing I&#x27;m not putting random chemicals in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad this is made with quality ingredients and WITHOUT flouride. The Creme de peppermint is my favorite flavor; not too strong but still fresh. I also like the bulk packs so I can stock up!</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to the chemical filed fluoride toothpastes. I do wish it whitened better or that one of their products would. Definitely have to brush more often, but we feel safer!</li>
    <li> I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toothpaste!  It makes my teeth feel very clean, and it helps with a health problem I have.  I wrote a review called Black Hairy Tongue about using Colloidal Silver, which I will not repeat here.  It contains carrageenan, which some are leery of, but carrageenan is just seaweed, and unless it has been sulphureted and heated to very high temperatures, my understanding is that it is more good for you than bad for you.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Good price, mellow tasting toothpaste instead of the usual harsh minty paste.</li>
    <li> Yep, love this toothpaste for what&#x27;s in it and what&#x27;s not.  Fresh, clean and just plain good.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, tastes great and does not give me mouth sores like toothpaste containing SLS (sodium laurelth sulfate). I also like that there is no fluoride since that may be questionable.</li>
    <li> I will never use anything else. Fresh mouth. Clean teeth. Great foaming.</li>
    <li> I love how this toothpaste is cruelty free, which is the main reason I purchased it. I also like how it doesn&#x27;t leave me with a bad taste in my mouth like other brands.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find a good toothpaste with no floride and this brand is just great. I got six of them not only because it is a better deal but because I want to give some to family members to help them not use floride also.</li>
    <li> So I made the switch from the big name brands to this.  My husband was curious but refused to leave his beloved toxic toothpaste UNTIL he tested this and found that this too gives a little foam when brushing.  That was the big thing for him to switch.  He associates foaming with clean (although he knows better).  Now, he has the best of both worlds, less toxins and foam... he is a happy camper.  As far as the taste, it is nice and peppermint.  My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean for a  long time (compared with the big companies) but I know it did the trick and will buy again.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff at our house!</li>
    <li> My only brand of toothpaste I buy. Love it.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste ever! Tastes fresh and makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
    <li> The best  natural toothpaste. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Not too strong of a minty flavor, but enough to give you a nice breath.  Everyone in the family use it including the children.  They don&#x27;t mind the minty flavor either.  We find it also cleans all the sugary residue off of the teeth very well.</li>
    <li> I have now ended my journey for the perfect toothpaste. It all began in another era - discovering the less sugary taste of a baking soda toothpaste from Arm and Hammer or somesuch thing. As I grew older and traveled, I found other pastes. Organic, unsweetened. Tom&#x27;s - which later became Colgate. Traitors! I went to Australia for Grant&#x27;s. Good enough, to be sure, but pricey and still a little overly sweetened, even if by everyone&#x27;s new best buddy, xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;Far and wide. Cheap and expensive. DIY clay methods. All just to get clear of putting nonsense on my teeth and paying an arm and a hammer to do so. So, screw you, Tom. G&#x27;day, Grant. I&#x27;m walking through Nature&#x27;s Gate. Forever and ever and ever. Until they go out of business.</li>
    <li> Our family switched over to this natural toothpaste about a year ago.  The switch was relatively painless and now when we taste regular toothpaste it tastes pretty disgusting.  Cleans well, freshens breath and economical compared to the prices of natural toothpastes in stores. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> In short, it foams, cleans well and the best vegan product I have been using. Plus, my order came with some coupons that you can use when you order more stuff from nature&#x27;s gate website. Make sure you check inside of the boxes before you dispose them because coupons are printed in the product boxes.</li>
    <li> Very happy about this product. Never tried a natural toothpaste before even though I&#x27;ve always wanted to. Now since I am very concerned about what I give my children, I gave this a go. I have stopped using Floride toothpaste altogether. Natures Gate tastes great and I&#x27;ve only tried Creme de Peppermint, but since we love it at home so much we don&#x27;t want to use another flavor.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find toothpaste without the bad stuff. Even kids toothpastes have bed chemicals in them. Yeay Nature&#x27;s Gate! And tastes like minty, regular toothpaste. Why doesn&#x27;t anyone else do this? They&#x27;ve cornered the market!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best toothpaste I have used. I cannot use toothpastes such as colgate or crest because I am allergic to some ingredients they include in them, thus provoking my mouth and tongue to irritate and hurt. At first, I did use Tom&#x27;s toothpaste, but my gosh it is expensive. This 6-pack of Nature Gate is a deal! It is powerful and cleans amazingly. It is gentle so that I dont get a reaction. Plus, no foam! I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Good. Not a fan of the flavor. Husband is usually the lucky one and he hasn&#x27;t complained, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> This is the first toothpaste my entire family agrees on. I have settled on this for the health of my family which makes any mom feel good. But how often do kids like something that you tell them is good for them? Rarely. In this case, It&#x27;s a winner.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t stay with you for longer than you like after you&#x27;ve brushed and rinsed. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste around. I buy it in bulk</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is natural, my dentist approves of my oral hygiene after 6 months of use, and food tastes like food still after brushing. I can&#x27;t brush my teeth with traditional toothpaste anymore as it makes me gag. Brushing my tongue with a toothbrush that just had traditional toothpaste on it (even after rinsing) is now nearly impossible. I&#x27;m spoiled by good product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product 100% and your dentist would likely never notice that you switched toothpastes, or maybe he or she would notice an improvement in the amount of plaque, tartar, and gum disease/inflammation.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this Flouride-free toothpaste for years.  Unfortunately, I just read the ingredients once again and am very disappointed.  Looking now for another brand without questionable ingredients....sorry to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Natural Flavor??, Carrageenan, Hydrated Silica, Calcium Glycerophosphate, Bisabolol,</li>
    <li> Man, boy &amp; woman love it.. my daughter hates it. She refuses to use it as she says the taste is the most awful she has ever had. *shrugs* We don&#x27;t agree, but don&#x27;t assume everyone will like the taste. She has no problem with Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It works. It taste good. It is by far the best natural toothpaste and it is affordable and I like the bulk option.</li>
    <li> Fluoride free?  Me too!  This is a good toothpaste for avoiding fluoride.  Cleans nicely, has a good taste and good amount of foam.</li>
    <li> I gave this a shot after realizing I&#x27;m allergic to store bought brands such as Crest and Aquafresh. Not exactly sure what it is but as soon as I started using the Nature&#x27;s Gate Toothpaste I stopped sneezing after brushing my teeth. The toothpaste is fine. I wish it had more of a kick as far as freshness goes. Other than that my teeth are clean and happy and so is my dentist.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes delicious! I really like the tube design too (it&#x27;s plastic rather than the crimp type of design made of a metallic substance). Ever since I quit using toothpaste with fluoride I stopped getting acne around my mouth. This is a pretty tasty toothpaste...with a smooth consistency (I like this better than the Jason brand). This is minty and refreshing and teams well with my sonicare toothbrush. This is definitely my new favorite toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Pack of 6 so make sure you have place to store them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good taste; very \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; paste as the name of the product indicates.</li>
    <li> I like all Nature&#x27;s gate tooth pastes. I will be using their products from now on.</li>
    <li> When I used it the first time, I was a little doubtful whether I would like the lack of sweetness. But after 1 week of continuous use, am hooked on to it. I made the right decision in buying the 6 pack. I threw out the old toothpaste(Aquafresh) into the trash, coz if I kept it around, I may end up using it sometime.&lt;br /&gt;Tube is designed such that the paste comes out nicely.</li>
    <li> I have really bad teeth and I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using Nature&#x27;s Gate about 5 years ago....Also about a week after a cleaning, I went away for a week forgetting my toothpaste.  I used my relative&#x27;s name-brand toothpaste and my teeth felt like I had not had a cleaning for about 2 years (felt very gunked up) and not that clean smooth feeling.  As soon as I returned and resumed the use of Nature&#x27;s Gate, my teeth felt smooth again.  I was really surprised that my teeth could feel so bad with a name-brand.  I am sticking with Nature&#x27;s Gate! ....though it seems that EWG&#x27;s (environmental working group) skindeep does not rate it as low as I once thought.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all natural. Tastes great and it comes in pack of six. Although, I would like it to have more foam. For the price and quantity, this is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> Tastes good and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals.for anyone who suffers from canker sores you should give this a try</li>
    <li> We have tried lots of different natural toothpaste and this is by far the best. I feel like it cleans well and has a great flavor!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m a long time Tom&#x27;s toothpaste user back when they had a decent toothpaste; and when they where a small &amp; private company. Because of all of their negative re-formulations and paying more for less of a lesser quality, I started looking for a natural toothpaste elsewhere. And after much research, I found that Nature&#x27;s Gate was my best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Nature&#x27;s Gate: Some day, if ingredients get expensive, please don&#x27;t skimp on quality and product size.. Just raise the price if you have to. AND, PLEASE don&#x27;t ever sell your company to a large corporation.</li>
    <li> Why is an ingredient like this found in a &#x27;natural&#x27; product?  Outrageous!  Spend your dollars elsewhere so you don&#x27;t have to worry about this harmful additive in your every day toothpaste! Or look up easy make it at home toothpaste using just three ingredients!</li>
    <li> Only stuff I use, taste is good leaves my teeth feeling great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Not as much bubbles as other toothpastes but certainly does the job. Feels very clean and fresh afterwards</li>
    <li> Poison free toothpaste that leaves your mouth feeling clean.  Been using for couple years no cavities and no side effects from being poisoned by fluoride.</li>
    <li> So many natural toothpastes feel abrasive or seem to disappear on the brush, this one is hands down my favorite, I order in bulk now!</li>
    <li> best toothpaste I have tried so far. I was changing from one to another until I found this one, I have bee using Nature&#x27;s gate toothpaste for the last 3-4 years. The peppermint kind is very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Okay I am so happy i found our new toothpaste. My husband only wants natural toothpastes so we have tried a few different brands. We were recently using Jason one however we were spending a a heck load more than what this costs. It tastes great and we LOVE it! Definitely a new staple for our family!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about a year now.  My teeth feel extremely clean, like squeaky clean, after using the product.  The flavor is just right and tastes very refreshing.  Best of all, my teeth have maintained confidently white while using this whole time.</li>
    <li> I was referred to purchase these for a healthier more natural toothpaste and I love it.  It isn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; for my kids either.  I&#x27;m sold on it and will never by another.</li>
    <li> Finally a toothpaste without the Flouride and other &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;. Nature&#x27;s Gate is smooth, tastes GREAT and leaves my mouth clean and minty. The first time I used it with my Sonic Care QuadPace toothbrush, I got so carried away by the texture and flavor that I lost track of the time and was surprised when my Sonic Care timed-out! Natures&#x27;s gate is my toothpaste of choice even though there are other brands in my bathroom drawer.</li>
    <li> The consistency is a little odd, but easy to get used to. We&#x27;ve been using this product for months now and we love it. Just don&#x27;t get the Anise flavor - to weird!</li>
    <li> This has a mild peppermint taste and my family is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, taste isn&#x27;t bad like I thought it would be. I think my teeth and gums are much healthier using this. I bought this because it is a VEGAN product and it also does not contain any harmful chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> Like much better then the popular brands which I used to use</li>
    <li> Good quality toothpaste</li>
    <li> i ordered this toothpaste awhile back. i love it, my daughter loves! my teeth have never felt so clean and none of the poisonous fluoride to worry about.</li>
    <li> Nice toothpaste, nice taste, without fluoride, and this pack has a good size. Almost all the ingredientes are natural. I really enjoyed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and fluoride-free toothpaste. I&#x27;ve using it for two months and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> No Fluoride! Which is Amazing!</li>
    <li> This has both taste and quality.  We will use this as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> I only used it for a week, but I love the clean &amp; fresh feeling it leaves behind. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Without the negative side- effects of fluoride. I&#x27;m so happy to find a really good non-fluoride toothpaste! Thank you, Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
    <li> I order this in a six pack; great natural toothpaste at a fraction of the cost you find in heath food store. Very pleased with taste</li>
    <li> Our family has been using this toothpaste for a few years now. All natural and keeps our teeth/gums clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> Ive tried many natural toothpastes, but for some reason I was even sensitive to those even though they claimed it was all natural. But this brand is by far the BEST natural toothpaste out there and I recommend it for the sensitive people. I haven&#x27;t had much breakouts around my lips, and more importantly the ingredients are safe. The only negative thing about the toothpaste is that it has a creamy texture and doesnt clean as well as others,  I think because its a little too thick but hey that&#x27;s why they called it  &amp;#34;Creme de&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This toothpaste... Man.... This toothpaste was the most amazing thig to happen to me. I have unlocked the power of my third eye and am writing this review with just my thoughts. Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to use Pronamel because of the sensitivity (my poor enamel has been worn away) of my teeth. I was looking for a more natural toothpaste and found this wonderful gift from nature. At first, I wasn&#x27;t used to the lack of a strong mint flavor, but now I absolutely love it. Over time, the minty flavor has become such a level that &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste is way too intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff because I can brush my teeth after eating chocolate and it cleans wonderfully with no chocolatey residue, or drink OJ shortly after brushing my teeth and it doesn&#x27;t taste awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wont be going back to anything else. Price is great, product is fabulous.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for years, so that is in itself a testimonial.  It doesn&#x27;t have floride, a known carcinogen, which makes it even better.  The more natural, the better.  It has good flavor--as good as any regular brand.</li>
    <li> This seems too good to be true -  an efffective pleasanr tasting non-toxic toothpaste at a reasonable price.  But there you have it, it is what it is.  I was sure I would need to brush more often than my usual 2 - 3 times a day with this gentle natural product but in fact my teeth feel clean for just as long after brushing as they did using Crest or Colgate.  I am extremely satisfied with this toothpaste and hope that Amazon continues to make it available.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural toothpaste that I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ve used it for few years and have never had any issues at the dentist.  I would prefer that it didn&#x27;t have carrageenan as an ingredient, so it&#x27;s not perfect.  The taste and feel isn&#x27;t any different than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste such as Crest.  However, the peppermint was a little much for my kids, but I find it refreshing.</li>
    <li> We like this and like that it is available through Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> Beware.  This product does not contain fluoride.  I just had the worst dental checkup of my life after switching to this Natural toothpaste.  I am 55 and have never had a cavity in my life.  Now, I may lose a tooth due to decay.  They said it might last a few more years.  I am devastated.  I immediately read the ingredients on this product and discovered it has no fluoride.  My bad.  I am switching back to a fluoride toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Obviously, there are strong feelings on this topic.  Name calling does not make people listen to you.  I am entitled to my opinion.  From Web MD -&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride is a mineral that occurs naturally in many foods and water. Every day, minerals are added to and lost from a tooth&#x27;s enamel layer through two processes, demineralization and remineralization. Minerals are lost (demineralization) from a tooth&#x27;s enamel layer when acids -- formed from plaque bacteria and sugars in the mouth -- attack the enamel. Minerals such as fluoride, calcium, and phosphate are redeposited (remineralization) to the enamel layer from the foods and waters consumed. Too much demineralization without enough remineralization to repair the enamel layer leads to tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride helps prevent tooth decay by making the tooth more resistant to acid attacks from plaque bacteria and sugars in the mouth. It also reverses early decay. In children under 6 years of age, fluoride becomes incorporated into the development of permanent teeth, making it difficult for acids to demineralize the teeth. Fluoride also helps speed remineralization as well as disrupts acid production in already erupted teeth of both children and adults.</li>
    <li> My husband and I like this toothpaste since we stopped using anything with flouride in it. It cleans our teeth very well. If you order enough items so you don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping it is much cheaper than buying in the stores.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know Nature&#x27;s Gate was owned by Haliburton, won&#x27;t buy this brand again. I&#x27;m not certain that I trust the claims of natural, etc.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste it took a while for me to get use to the fact it doesn&#x27;t foam like regular toothpaste does but now im use to it and i prefer it.The peppermint makes it taste the regular commercial toothpaste but with out all the unhealthy stuff in it. its a winner.</li>
    <li> Keeping it simple...&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste taste good. It tastes real.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the paste is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s a product the whole family and fluoride free.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels fresh and clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite flavor of all the Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste.  The price is excellent.  This is a very good way to avoid using fluoride toothpaste because we all know how bad it is for you.  Removing fluoride from your brushing routine will give you so many benefits.  I been ordering this packs for sometime now and will continue to buy them.  You save so much more money buying them here than at the local store and in bundles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is no different than regular toothpaste so you won&#x27;t notice the difference.</li>
    <li> we love this toothpaste</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural toothpastes and this is by far the best. The taste is not nauseating and it works well.</li>
    <li> Tried using Toms of Maine but no one liked it, plus it has sodium lauryl sulfate in that brand.  Nature&#x27;s Gate has good ingredients and tastes pretty good too - not aggressively minty like most mainstream toothpastes, but still refreshing.  I&#x27;m ordering more today as we just ran out.  Think the six tubes lasted a little over a year for two people who brush twice a day (plus I gave one tube to my mom).  If you want natural toothpaste, I recommend this product.  My dentist is still happy with my teeth a year after use (btw).</li>
    <li> We try to get the best price for our organic products as possible, this was the best deal we have found to date on this toothpaste. We highly suggest buying your organic toothpaste from this supplier. If you want to save money of course. Otherwise go elsewhere and spend more, thats up to you.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been looking for fluoride-free toothpastes and this one is the best so far. The peppermint is nice and the toothpaste is creamy smooth. Highly recommend !!</li>
    <li> We mistakenly, with a lot of hope, bought a six-pack of this toothpaste without realizing that it wasn&#x27;t going to leave our mouths feeling &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and take away bad morning breath. Actually, it left a strange and unpleasant aftertaste. If this is not a big deal for you, given the human and environment benefits, well, do what you want! :)</li>
    <li> I tried about 30 different toothpastes before finding this one. It&#x27;s by far my favorite. It&#x27;s minty with a bite that I can feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ditched the major commercial toothpastes because they contained a lot of chemicals and additives like colorants and artificial sweeteners. I hated Tom&#x27;s of Maine because of their metal tubes. Hard to squeeze all of it out once it starts emptying out and sometimes the tube would puncture, leaking toothpaste everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dessert Essence I also didn&#x27;t like. The one I bought was sweetened with stevia and had a very unpleasant strong after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nature&#x27;s Gate also makes a toothpaste gel one that tastes really bad. Get this one!</li>
    <li> Great deal! Super price! Love the subscribe and save! Product came just as expected. no complaints. wont have to go out shopping for toothpaste for at least 6 months!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> We love this toothpaste. Best one we have found that does not have fluoride and all of the other harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste and I really like the mostly natural ingredients and the mild mint taste.  I NEVER use regular toothpaste as I find the taste over-bearing and too foaming.  I use this to get away from that, and from the fluoride.  I would love to find an affordable option without the glycerin and some of the other ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute  outstanding natural toothpaste, I was concerned  at that time I ordered because it was my first time, but now 2 months later or so, I can not live without it. It just amazing hot it taste and the feeling of very cleaned teeth after your done brushing. And did I mentioned that is natural, fluoride FREE. 5 stars well deserved.</li>
    <li> simply the best... I add a small scoop of baking soda every morning to give it a little more power but I love this toothpaste... please don&#x27;t sell out to one of the big brands, they RUIN products. Look at what happened to Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is the closest I have found to &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; toothpaste and without floride. It is close to the other name brand toothpastes we used to use.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural toothpaste, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  It has a very clean, fresh, minty taste, and my mouth feels great after using it.  It&#x27;s not overpowering.  It seems to dissolve in the mouth better than regular toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a few weeks now.  I like it.  It has a nice minty taste, but not as strong and long lasting as Colgate, Crest, etc, (the non-natural).  The consistency of the paste takes a little getting use to (not as thick) but with time it becomes the &amp;#34;norm&amp;#34;.  It seems to be doing a good job of cleaning my teeth.  This is the first natural non-chemical, non-flouride toothpaste I have used  Time will tell if it keeping my teeth clean.  So far I am happy with the product.  I wish it didn&#x27;t have carrageenan in it but then again you don&#x27;t eat your toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love the natural ingredients and the pricing.</li>
    <li> Im sooo happy with the flavor and the smell!! Its so difficult to find toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have fluoride and parabens, and this product definitely doesn&#x27;t!!! :)</li>
    <li> I have used this tooth past now for three or four years, and I will keep doing so as long as they make it. There are no harmful ingredients in it, and they clean my teeth perfectly. People do mention on occasion how shiny my teeth are. And very little goes a long way, no need to pile it on! I squeeze about a quarter of an inch on my brush, and that is all that&#x27;s needed to do a great job! I also like a tooth past with a milder taste, nothing overbearing! This paste fits the bill!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural with safe ingredients, however it&#x27;s a complete mess! My kids bathroom was always covered in goopy white toothpaste because it is rather runny. Even my husband had the same problem :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is tasty and much better than fluoride toothpaste, but it does contain GLYCERIN. This coats the teeth and prevents natural restoration of enamel. Enamel once gone cannot really be restored, but glycerin makes it more difficult to maintain.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste. Could be a little more minty.</li>
    <li> I wish you could get toothpaste in flavors that weren&#x27;t mint and anise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a number of food allergies as well as preferences for types of ingredients in our products. Nature&#x27;s Gate meets all of these requirements and does a great job of keeping our teeth clean. I&#x27;m not sure why but my teeth seem less sensitive since we switched from Tom&#x27;s of Maine three years ago to Nature&#x27;s Gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good taste, good ingredients, nice cleaning power - everything you need in a toothpaste.</li>
    <li> We love it. SLS-Free. No Fluoride. And it leaves my smile beautiful!</li>
    <li> We use Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste, shampoo and my wife uses the body wash...and love them all.  This toothpaste taste nice and minty, and I plan on using all these products for life.</li>
    <li> They may have the same initials (SLS), but sodium lauroyl sarcosinate and sodium lauryl sulfate are NOT the same thing. Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate is only similar to sodium lauryl sulfate in that they’re both surfactants, but that’s about where it ends</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now.  I&#x27;ve had two dentist appointments in that time with no problems.  I will keep buying this.</li>
    <li> Good natural toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive teeth, and although it doesn&#x27;t whiten, my teeth haven&#x27;t gotten more yellow either. It has a pleasant peppermint taste with a slightly herbal aftertaste after about a minute of brushing. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural toothpaste, I&#x27;d give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Great deal. All came quickly and none were expired.</li>
    <li> fresh taste, awesome ingredients, love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the content of this toothpaste. My family would prefer the traditional types with flouride etc. This one doesn&#x27;t have that strong minty refreshing taste that we&#x27;ve all become accustomed to making us think our teeth are cleaner than without it. On days when I really want that extra zap I rinse with mouthwash but I think my teeth are just as white with this as the other traditional varieties. I&#x27;ll buy it again until I find something my family likes better.</li>
    <li> I switched over from my old toothpaste after I read a lot of negative information about fluoride.  This toothpaste is flouride free as well as free from a lot of other chemicals that are usually added to toothpaste.  The taste is great and it leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than other toothpastes that Ive tried.</li>
    <li> My gums no long are tender and sore since I eliminated all the crap in other toothpastes- fluoride, aluminum, teeth-whitening ingredients. Teeth are as white as ever and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I keep giving this stuff to friends and family, i hope they are actually using/enjoying it, not just thinking i&#x27;m some kind of conspiracy nut. I recommend this product, also the Nature&#x27;s gate Anise toothpaste is a black liquorish kind of flavor, if that&#x27;s your thing.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I am a pharmacist and also into the whole no flouride movement. I liked Toms until I found out that its probably a subsid of Colgate or some other giant corporation. This toothpaste feels and tastes more natural. I hate the chemical taste in my mouth after brushing my teeth and this does not have that. The color is a little darker and the consistency is not as thick as Colgate (my previous standby) - but you will get used to it. Buy a few 6 packs - you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It&#x27;s a good toothpaste that leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great toothpaste. Feels so great after brushing....not too much harsh as other toothpastes...moreover it is free from fluoride and totally natural...I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a delicious tasting natural toothpaste containing none of the bad chemicals or fluoride that manufacturers want to dump into toothpaste these days that we don&#x27;t want and don&#x27;t need. Have tried many of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or organic toothpastes and took a chance on this one, sight unseen, buying a six-pack - I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> inexpensive, taste great, really nice foaming action and it works. i like to add a little baking soda for extra scrubbing. fluoride (poison to a child&#x27;s developing brain) free is the way to be.</li>
    <li> MInty fresh!  After leaving conventional toothpaste, my sensitive teeth issues have dissappeared, I recommend at least giving it a try.  I like this even better than Tom&#x27;s</li>
    <li> In today&#x27;s market, it seems like every toothpaste has a whitener, tarter control breath freshener...etc in it! So when our daughter got braces, the last thing I was worried about was toothpaste. Until the orthodontist told us that she needed a nonwhitening, nontarter control...non everything toothpastes. Just an old fashioned toothpaste that was would her teeth! I couldn&#x27;t find it in our local market, or drug store. As always, I then turn to Amazon. If course they had something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what we ordered (and reordered!)! It has been working great! She likes the flavor (and we all know how picky kids are about the flavor of toothpaste and it not being too minty or burny!). She will be using this for the remainder of her time in braces.</li>
    <li> As a disclaimer: I normally don&#x27;t have dental issues, but I have had some work done in the past 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this exclusively in October 2012, but held off on reviewing this until after my recent dentist visit in March 2013.  I must say, Nature&#x27;s Gate Natural Toothpaste works very well for me.  My dentist was surprised at the lack of buildup on my teeth and around my gum line since my last visit.  My normal routine is brushing with this toothpaste and rinsing with generic antiseptic in the morning and before bed.  Occasionally I will use floss, but that&#x27;s a rare occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s mouth/saliva is different, so I don&#x27;t recommend you copy my routine.  This is just the method that is most effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue (if you could even call it that) is that it has a very bland taste.  I barely taste the peppermint at all.  Based on other reviews, I was expecting more flavor than what I was provided.  Maybe my taste buds are shot.  The taste is really one of the least important features to toothpaste; so long as it doesn&#x27;t taste like a sweaty armpit or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a good product and I will be using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Based on some other reviews, I expected a bigger difference from regular toothpaste. It&#x27;s not that big of a difference. really only took 1 or 2 days to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically flavorless, which is the only downside, but id rather have a flavorless toothpaste without sodium fluoride.</li>
    <li> Does the job and it leaves your mouth feeling very clean. I would recommend it to everyone. I love that its organic</li>
    <li> I wanted to get away from products with Aluminum and found this at Amazon.  The toothpaste tastes good and it cleans well.  I wish it had the Pronamel and sensitivity.  I have to rotate betwenn the Natures Gate and Sensodyne.</li>
    <li> This has been our fave toothpaste for years.  Purchasing a bulk quantity has worked out great for us.  This is the second time we ordered.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to Tom&#x27;s of Maine. The price was a selling point. Does the job and is fluoride free.</li>
    <li> We have tried numerous fluoride-free toothpastes, and this is the best so far.  I normally have very sensitive teeth, and while this isn&#x27;t marketed for this, it seems to help.  It cleans as well as commercial brands, and the mint is just right.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite paste</li>
    <li> I was looking for a toothpaste that was fluoride free and could get rid of bad breath.  I battled constant bad breath from the regular toothpastes in the stores.  I had been using Crest Pro Health for quite some time now and read up on how fluoride is bad for our bodies and decided to try Nature&#x27;s Gate Natural Toothpaste.  By the third use my bad breath was gone and my teeth felt smoother.  I would suggest this for any family.  I will definitely be buying this from now on!!</li>
    <li> I used coral, jasons, himalaya tooth pastes in the past. This is the first time i purchased Nature&#x27;s Gate  Toothpaste and it is far better than all  the tooth pastes i used till now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t absolutely love it by itself. Not sure if it&#x27;s the abrasiveness of the baking soda or whatnot, but I usually use this toothpaste with a tiny pea drop of my regular toothpaste. I know that the whole point is to rid of SLS and Fluoride, but all in all I feel that they balance out when I use this method. Besides that, SLS and Fluoride are more toxic if swallowed. Who the hell swallows toothpaste? I make sure I rinse it all out and honestly, I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth have never been better. Like the fact that you can buy a 6 pack and they really last you out especially if you use the 2 toothpaste method.</li>
    <li> Leaves my mouth with a very clean feeling. Not great when used with the old-school Listerine ... too much of a flavor clash. Otherwise. Very happy. Also, great value.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste! It&#x27;s nice and refreshing, and works great.</li>
    <li> Why did I ever use the poisonous toothpaste sold at the store? I didn&#x27;t know any better and I hadn&#x27;t found this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Good flavor</li>
    <li> A safe alternative to &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; toothpaste. I actually prefer this to all others now.</li>
    <li> Tastes nasty, but I like it despite. It just takes some getting used to. Glad to find a toothpaste without fluoride in it for once. Would like to see the price come down a little, though.</li>
    <li> This paste has a nice mint taste and it has made a noticeable difference with just a few uses already. I am always searching for products to be healthier in our lives and this is one of them. My teeth feel smooth and clean but not abraded. I don&#x27;t have the dry throat after brushing that so many other brands cause. My breath is fresher longer. It washes out of my mouth, toothbrush and sink easier (which to me indicates no drying build-up). Unless I find something different out through use, I&#x27;m giving it full marks for now because of the positive impacts it has made. So, I give it a good recommendation. Keep smiling :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want fluoride, this is it .  I like it much better than the gels, nice foamy toothpaste.  Has great taste and mouth feels refreshed.</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Natural Toothpaste is possibly the best toothpaste available these days. It is free of fluorides, parabens, sulfates, artificial colors, and artificial sweeteners. While this sounds rather not too uncommon these days, you will find many competing &amp;#34;healthy image&amp;#34; brands do contain one of more of the above if you read their fine print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me the closest that comes in similarity is Jason&#x27;s by Hain but I think this is even better as the smoothness is greater and the flavor more refined.&lt;br /&gt;A very well made toothpaste without the stuff you want to avoid anyways.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the natural toothpaste and think it gets my teeth nice and clean. I don&#x27;t love the flavor but that&#x27;s more of a preference thing anyway. I would LOVE a cinnamon flavor. A family member of mine gets sores and bleeding gums with conventional toothpastes that have whitening additives has no problems with this kind. He has switched over completely and loves it! It is a little more pricey than drugstore kind on sale, but for the health benefits and no fluoride, I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> We like this toothpaste and recommend it to everyone. The paste is very soft and gentle on your teeth. We use it now for more than a year.</li>
    <li> After buying this product for a couple of years because it is fluoride-free, I was very disappointed to learn that it contains carrageenan, now a know cause of inflammation. It is also known as a natural ingredient that you should ban from your diet: [...]. I hope I can find a relatively inexpensive toothpaste for our family that is not harmful to us.</li>
    <li> Sadly - it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to more natural products. I learned about little blue beads in some Crest toothpastes (now removed) that lodged in your teeth in gums and that was the last straw. It doesn&#x27;t taste wonderful - has a bit of a medicinal aftertaste. It isn&#x27;t pleasant, but I was still okay with using it. However, I ended up developing bleeding gums - a problem I&#x27;d never experienced before. Sometimes it was pretty bad and it made me feel uncomfortable. I thought it might be an unrelated health problem, so I used a toothpaste from the store to see if it got better, worse, or stayed the same. The condition resolved within a couple days and hasn&#x27;t returned so I can&#x27;t use this anymore. Maybe it was an allergy of some kind or something. I wish it would have worked but wanted to share in case someone else has the same issue.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is an excellent value, it tastes good, is natural, and works well. I recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ira</li>
    <li> Tastes just like any other toothpaste. Not runny. Affordable. It cost 4.88 in whole foods. My son likes it, will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is a great item to get in order to avoid OTC types that contain additional additives. Fresh minty taste.</li>
    <li> Feels so calming brushing. Love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t contain floride which is why I bought this toothpaste. Good taste and seems to clean just as good as regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks regularly as I should. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my dental health that wasn&#x27;t there before. This toothpaste is better tasting than the Tom&#x27;s fluoride-free mint toothpaste I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe that fluoride is helpful for teeth and I&#x27;m hoping to surprise my dentist in the next visit. 2 visits ago, I was using Tom&#x27;s fluoride-free toothpaste and had the best visit ever. He was surprised I was using that and recommended fluoride based toothpaste. Even though he admitted that HE filters fluoride out of his family&#x27;s drinking water! For the first time, the dentist didn&#x27;t say my teeth needed improvement. After that I was using fluoride toothpaste, but not regularly as I should and my last visit was not as good. He said my teeth looked fine, not the gums. I would blame that on my schedule more than the toothpaste itself. My mouth looks cleaner than it ever has now just using this toothpaste and brushing regularly for a few weeks. Once in a while I use biotene mouthwash. My gingivitis went away during that period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if you stick with this and stay away from sugary, syrupy, or lingering, sticky foods, especially soft drinks, you will see your dental health improve. Your brushing schedule is more important than the type of toothpaste you&#x27;re using. However, I believe fluoride is toxic and should not be added in toothpaste or water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been making the transition to using all natural, organic and safe products within the last year. I haven&#x27;t found a natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve felt confident in trying, but I tooo the plunge and bought this today. I love the consistency. It&#x27;s not as thick as regular conventional toothpaste, but I have never particularly fancied that to begin with. The flavor of it is amazing. It&#x27;s not too strong and has the perfect  balance of peppermint. My teeth feel very clean! I normally use Sensodyne but I have decided to do away with all the chemicals I can! Especially fluoride! Having recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, I need to eliminate that completely from my daily regime. I&#x27;m highly pleased with this product and definitely recommend trying it out. I won&#x27;t be buying anything but from here on out!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste! Good flavor and good clean. Definitely can tell a difference when on occassion you have to go back to other toothpastes which now that I am used to a more natural product actually irritate my gums.</li>
    <li> We just don&#x27;t like the flavor.  My husband does not think it cleans very well, and it does not leave your mouth feeling real fresh.</li>
    <li> I am so glad a friend told me about this toothpaste. I have tried several flouride free toothpaste, but this is the only one that had the same lather as regular toothpaste. Use it all the time now.</li>
    <li> Good... very good toothpaste !!!</li>
