      <li>my God everybody love it</li>
      <li>Got this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day he has enjoyed using it.</li>
      <li>emphasis in this product is its design, which is undeniably \\&quot;pretty,\\&quot; with a gold-tinted metal folding 4\\&quot; x 5\\&quot; x 1\\&quot; case, purported to be appropriate for travel, and 11 gold or brass plated grooming inplements bound to the halves of the case by elastic.  </li>
      <li>Best manicure set I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
      <li>They are very nice, high quality.</li>
      <li>The manicure set seems great (so far).</li>

      <li>Delivery service also fantastic arrived when you said it would.  </li>
      <li>Nice set and high quality.  </li>
      <li>Clean cuts.</li>
      <li>The price is slightly higher than most comparable sets, but worth the difference.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>would absolutely recommend this set if you want to impress someone with a good classy set of manicure tools.  </li>
      <li>My order was processed quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sharp, useful, and i like them.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>The tools  were smaller than I anticipated, I have not really had the time to evaluate them yet, but Amazons products have a real good history with me!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very well received, set is nice and the case is very visually</li>
      <li>Super Luxuary, very nice set... lets see how long it will last or it will rust or not.</li>
      <li>i recommend it very much.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s list price is now $10 cheaper and has been on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for 40% off pretty consistently for months (using pricezombie as source).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please be aware of the puffing that goes on Amazon&#x27;s review.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Please be aware of the puffing that goes on Amazon&#x27;s review.  </li>
      <li>Heavy, feels like good quality.</li>
      <li>Definitely a smart purchase.</li>
      <li>much recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it and uses it exclusively.  </li>
      <li>High quality!</li>
      <li>In fact, she likes it so much she bought one for her mother, for Mother&#x27;s day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The pieces really have some weight to them.</li>
      <li>The gold is really shiny and distinctive as well.</li>
      <li>I am sure the box would be a quick donation to the confiscation bin if you attempted a carry-on and a quicker trip to the secondary inspection if detected in checked luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>well packed, high quality kit...</li>
      <li>Instruments are sharp and easy to handle just wish it would of had toenail scissor also</li>
      <li>The tools are sharp, well designed, and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>There is a set of blunt-ended nose-hair trimmer scissors, which if you have ever tried to use them are more trouble than they are worth and , which are 19th Century technology, if that recent.  </li>
      <li>I suspect, as is the case with many Amazon products, that a heavy percentage of the reviews are astroturfing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If this set has a weakness, its that the box just barely doesn&#x27;t live up to the stellar example set by the implements.  </li>
      <li>If you are familiar with the widely available Trim brand, which I have used since childhood, these will be a huge disappointment.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s always buying new tools or buying replacements to ones that broke</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of the greatest nail clipper sets I have ever owned and used. Work very well and has everything you can possibly need. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Better quality then i thought. Great value</li>
    <li> The very best of the best quality nail clipper ever!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful manicure set.</li>
    <li> Instruments are sharp and easy to handle just wish it would of had toenail scissor also</li>
    <li> Heavy, feels like good quality. Case has excellent fit and finish. Never used the tools myself, it was a gift to a lady, who was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Purchased several months ago as a gift for my wife. She&#x27;s always doing her nails..painting, trimming, etc. She&#x27;s always buying new tools or buying replacements to ones that broke so I figured I&#x27;d get her a nice all in one set.  She absolutely loves it and uses it exclusively.  In fact, she likes it so much she bought one for her mother, for Mother&#x27;s day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools are sharp and have remained so thus far. The finish is nice. The case is another added bonus. All in all it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my wife. Best manicure set I&#x27;ve used in a long time. Clean cuts. sharp implements. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Well made and a good value</li>
    <li> My order was processed quickly. Packaged well. The case is sturdy and velour lined. All the instruments work very well, are sharp and include safety guards. Pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The manicure set seems great (so far). However, the kit arrived with zero product information. For example, there was no contact or registration information about the lifetime warrantee.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Every tool I could ever need for my nails!</li>
    <li> Contains every tool I would ever need.  The case is nice looking and strong.  The tools are sharp, well designed, and easy to use.  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day he has enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife for her birthday and she loves them.  I am really really impressed by the quality of the instruments.  They all look really classy and are stamped with the 777 logo.  Who brands their manicure sets?  These guys do because they know their product is awesome.  Their clippers are sharp.  My wife says, &amp;#34;Koreans must know something about nail clippers that nobody else does.&amp;#34;  Yep.  I can&#x27;t compare how they perform compared to other expensive manicure kits, but we are both very impressed so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is pretty nice too.  it clicks shut and has a good weight to it.  If this set has a weakness, its that the box just barely doesn&#x27;t live up to the stellar example set by the implements.  The hinge seems sturdy enough, as does the latch, but for some reason the box doesn&#x27;t feel as bombproof as I would expect.  The retention strap seems good enough and looks like it will last a few decades in our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this set if you want to impress someone with a good classy set of manicure tools.  The gold is really shiny and distinctive as well.</li>
    <li> Very nice set.  It looks nice and travels well.  The instruments do their job. I would recommend to someone looking for a complete kit.</li>
    <li> Fit the bill perfectly,  the wife said it is great.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but noticed great quality.</li>
    <li> loved it.... the quality is excellent</li>
    <li> really good~ It is a really good gift for all the people, and I brought for myself it feel fantastic great!</li>
    <li> The tools  were smaller than I anticipated, I have not really had the time to evaluate them yet, but Amazons products have a real good history with me!</li>
    <li> It is an awesome product ...I am very happy</li>
    <li> Excellent quality Manicure set for years of usage with the appropriate cleaning and maintenance.</li>
    <li> oh. my God everybody love it</li>
    <li> Very nice case and set.  I purchased one as a gift and one for myself.  I was very pleased with the assortment.  This is by all means not a set to put in your purse.  It is rather heavy and too big to lug around.  If your looking for a set to keep at home, I would recommend.  All the items in my set work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Amozon, it was even better than it looked online, Fantastic...really very happy with my purchase. Delivery service also fantastic arrived when you said it would.  Very happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amozon...&lt;br /&gt;Regards Joy</li>
    <li> They are very nice, high quality. However, I thought I was ordering the gold toned set. Instead I got silver toned.</li>
    <li> The plated gold chips off.</li>
    <li> Great kit. Organized, convenient, and looks good.</li>
    <li> Nice set and high quality.  I bought the gold, shouldve bought the silver but I wont take off a for that star for the color due to the high quality.</li>
    <li> Having 777 before, and another one this time.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;It is very well received, set is nice and the case is very visually appealing.&lt;br /&gt;Very much recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a very luxury quality product, it is the must beautiful i have see, and also the must complete set of manicure and pedicure. i recommend it very much. it is the best</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit several months ago, looking for a travel ready kit to keep my nails in shape for guitar practice.  I was seduced by the reviews to this and its companion kit, the sole differnce of which was a different case.  I suspect, as is the case with many Amazon products, that a heavy percentage of the reviews are astroturfing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emphasis in this product is its design, which is undeniably \\&quot;pretty,\\&quot; with a gold-tinted metal folding 4\\&quot; x 5\\&quot; x 1\\&quot; case, purported to be appropriate for travel, and 11 gold or brass plated grooming inplements bound to the halves of the case by elastic.  That is where the good ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad is the quality of the tools.  There are four separate clippers, for toes, fingers, cuticles, and fingers.  None is very sharp.  If you are familiar with the widely available Trim brand, which I have used since childhood, these will be a huge disappointment.  There is single combination nail cleaner and file, which is small, to allow it to fit into the case, but the end is very blunt, too blunt to be of any use cleaning nails, and the file is nonsense.  There is a set of blunt-ended nose-hair trimmer scissors, which if you have ever tried to use them are more trouble than they are worth and , which are 19th Century technology, if that recent.  There is another pair of nail scissors, hopefully, or should I say optimistically provided with a plastic shield.  In use, the product is dull, or gets that way quickly, and essentially useless. There are several other bladed and pronged Medieval looking implements that I have no clue what they could be, and have not figured out what they could be, which you would think that the manufacturer would at least provide a legend of what treasures they include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, this purports to be for \\&quot;travel,\\&quot;  One would need to be a brave soul to take this metal box with sharpened objects through a TSA security check point at an airport.  I am sure the box would be a quick donation to the confiscation bin if you attempted a carry-on and a quicker trip to the secondary inspection if detected in checked luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottom line is that it gathers dust in my bathroom, while I use other tools to do the jobs this pretty kit was supposed to do.  I should have returned it but got lazy and thought I would figure out something to do with it.  My wife ridicules me every time she sees it as a waste of money.  I might keep the case, but the tools are useless, or more correctly, not used since my first attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware of the puffing that goes on Amazon&#x27;s review.  And, if you run across a useless but pretty think like this, do yourself a favor and just send it back.he confiscation bin if you attempted a carry-on and a quicker trip to the secondary inspection if detected in checked luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottom line is that it gathers dust in my bathroom, while I use other tools to do the jobs this pretty kit was supposed to do.

    <li> Great quality, great price. Definitely a smart purchase.</li>
    <li> Final product wasn&#x27;t the quality I&#x27;d expect for such high priced manicure set. Case came scratched and I have used this for a while now and the tools aren&#x27;t screaming quality. I paid for this set just last year and it&#x27;s list price is now $10 cheaper and has been on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for 40% off pretty consistently for months (using pricezombie as source).</li>
    <li> nice product.  I don&#x27;t use half of the stuff in here so my wife took  it for her nail kit</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Great buy! High quality! The pieces really have some weight to them.</li>
    <li> It works but it is not high quality.  The chrome chips off and the edges don&#x27;t meet on some of the cutters.</li>
    <li> this is great for travel and I tate it every where I go.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item about two months ago. It is seemingly well crafted and made of sturdy materials. This manicure set is a step above several similar products I have ordered in the past which seem to be fabricated in a cookie cutter manner by the same manufacturer, and then sold by numerous retailers. The price is slightly higher than most comparable sets, but worth the difference.</li>
    <li> Very useful and beautiful set. I used them often. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I would be happy with this kit but I am wayyy happy with it. Well made and nice case.</li>
    <li> Took them with me to the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, useful, and i like them.</li>
    <li> this three 777 is the very best that you can buy !TOPS IN MY BOOK !!  buy for your self and friends . get them for your pre teens the tooling 1st class kit needs to be 100 usd !!! itis that great nice gold box too 1st class allthe way !! masterj saxton artist .</li>
    <li> great quality and nice durable case</li>
    <li> Super Luxuary, very nice set... lets see how long it will last or it will rust or not.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Thanks !!!!!</li>
    <li> Was given a set like these years ago as a gift while living  in South Korea hope these are as amazing as my first set</li>
    <li> Great set. I appreciate that each piece is sharp. Excellent choice</li>
