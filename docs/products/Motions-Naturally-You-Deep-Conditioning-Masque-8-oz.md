### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll be very happy with the result!</li>
      <li>One of the greatest trials of having waist-length curly hair is tangling, which leads to breakage.</li>
      <li>Loved this!</li>
      <li>Lol</li>
      <li>and I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>But this stuff is great</li>
      <li>It smelled great</li>
      <li>Pleasant fragrance that does not linger.</li>
      <li>I got this product for my wife and she absolutely loved it.</li>

      <li>I got this for my wife, and she loved it.  </li>
      <li>I like this hair conditioning masque, really good frizz</li>
      <li>It smells good.  </li>
      <li>Her hair is color-treated and fairly damaged</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>And feels amazing.</li>
      <li>And looks amazing.</li>
      <li>However, the directions include putting one&#x27;s hair under a warm dryer before rinsing.  </li>
      <li>but I have to be honest and say that it wasn&#x27;t all that.</li>
      <li>Something that would hold shape until it met the warm temperature of my hand and head.</li>
      <li>The combination of ingredients in perfect for someone who over processes their hair and wants it to be and not just feel healthy</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say it does a great job maintaining my hair&#x27;s moisture, keeping it healthy, and is just a great overall product.</li>
      <li>what it does is makes your hair more manageable and cleans up your kitchen areas .</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Am pleased with result.</li>
      <li>the best deep conditioner ever</li>
      <li>you are washing your hair in a sink or bending over a faucet, it would be better, as it could sit on a shelf or counter until you were done, and it might be easier not to drip it everywhere.  </li>
      <li>On a scale; 1 being nothing and 10 being magical, is give Motions Conditioning Masque a 7.5.</li>
      <li>Though that magic treatment probably doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
      <li>I love it this works so great it leaves my hair so soft and healthy feeling and just AMAZING</li>
      <li>hey, this is okay for guys too.</li>
      <li>I have been pleased with every item I have tried from the Mtions</li>
      <li>When I wake up, my hair is notably softer and not at all greasy.  </li>
      <li>And the aroma isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly feminine, so</li>
      <li>I tried this product about a month ago and fell in love.</li>
      <li>The detangling comb went through it as well as with a conditioner, but I was able to leave this in.</li>
      <li>I could tell already this stuff works like magic.</li>
      <li>When I wake up, my hair is notably softer and not at all greasy.  </li>
      <li>Most days, I shampoo, work the masque into my hair, and leave it on until the end of my shower.</li>
      <li>If you get done washing your hair in the shower, and then want to apply the conditioner to sit under a dryer, it would be more practical to use the jar.  </li>
      <li>Never having used a Motions product before, I was not too sure what to expect.</li>
      <li>If you use this eventually your hair will be more manageable as well.</li>
      <li>I like the cleanser alone better</li>
      <li>It works well on him and leaves his hair moisturized and healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a product hound and still trying to find the perfect deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>A consistency more like liquid soap instead of a spreadable</li>
      <li>Mostly I obtained these as a practical joke , presenting her with a dozen or so products at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s wonderful using as directed, when used in the same way as the TV one, the results are fabulous!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have found this gives a nice lift and healthy bounce to full, curly color treated hair in the ultra-dry wintertime of Alaska.  </li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll be very happy with the result!ially for long hair.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I had ever used Motions Products and I must say I was very pleased by it&#x27;s performance.</li>
      <li>She and I agreed that her hair was very soft, had a good smell and had more shine.</li>
      <li>It does not perform best using other methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it is easy to overdo it.</li>
      <li>and they work just fine.  </li>
      <li>and they work just fine.  </li>
      <li>, it did not make her hair feel smooth at all.  </li>
      <li>You, Deep Conditioning Masque was a great way to pamper my hair.</li>
      <li>fragrance is light and doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair like some of the products that knock you out with the smell.</li>
      <li>When he uses good conditioners his hair gets soft and curly instead of</li>
      <li>It was easy to use and had no unpleasant smells, etc.</li>
      <li>Smells great and my hair was always very dry whenever i got out of the shower.</li>
      <li>control moisturizes damaged dry hair very nicely.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>I love the shine after use and my hair looks so much healthier after use.</li>
      <li>It felt mosturized and full of life.</li>
      <li>I found it a bit runny, but it smells nice and leaves my hair really soft.  </li>
      <li>Okay so this stuff has a very perfumy smell to it.</li>
      <li>fragrance is not bad, but too floral for my liking.</li>
      <li>A nice pleasant smell, and a not too thick and greasy product.</li>
      <li>One thing you need to know is that it recommends leaving on for 10 to 15 minutes so don&#x27;t plan on a quick wash rinse condition and get going.  </li>
      <li>I figured since Motions is geared towards African American women, it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>I change the towel after about 15 minutes for a freshly heated one and when that one gets cool, I go to the sink and rinse out the Masque.  </li>
      <li>You Deep Conditioning Masque is a very nice conditioner that seems to work great with my African American hair.</li>
      <li>Having color-treated hair, I have to be careful what I use, and I find this product does an excellent job in deep conditioning my hair.</li>
      <li>It detangles the hair and imparts moisture throughout especially when you sit under a warm dryer for about 15 minutes.  </li>
      <li>The 8-ounce container is a nice size and will last for quite awhile.</li>
      <li>I rarely have time to use this, because it recommends to put it on your hair and leave on for 5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>I love hair masques, and Motions Naturally</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future.</li>
      <li>tried again and made sure I used the recommended Motions Naturally</li>
      <li>Definetly worth a try.</li>
      <li>love that this is a good conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cost you a lot of money and works just as well as the more expensive products.</li>
      <li>That is the PERFECT time for me to also rinse away a hair Masque, so I have begun first applying the Motions Deep Conditioning Masque to my dry hair on one of my in-between washings days, putting on a heat treatment cap and then wrapping my head in a heated towel.  </li>
      <li>Most of the new conditioning products from Motions do exactly what we want</li>
      <li>The first time I did just a quick wash condition and that was that..</li>
      <li>This product keeps my hair very soft and easy to comb through, and my hair is soft and healthy looking even when I rinse it out.</li>
      <li>Motions Deep Conditioning Masque is a good masque for natural hair.  </li>
      <li>I have been natural for exactly 1 year now and was looking for a good deep conditioner to try.</li>
      <li>price tag for this product is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>The lack of chlorine helps keep my hair in good shape and the water rinses aways air pollution, dirt attracted to the hair products I use, any flakes off the scalp and the little excess oil I have.  </li>
      <li>Very displeased!</li>
      <li>Do that for a full minute, just as if you were using a normal shampoo, but instead using just water.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I have to say first if you think your hair is going to look like the photos, then this is not the product for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
      <li>Overall, I was pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>wanted to give this three stars as it sort of works, but not with the kind of performance expected from the promotional information.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not work well in my hair, my friend loves it though.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft and easy to detangle!</li>
    <li> Container was less than half full!!! as if it was poured out or used prior to shipping. Very displeased!</li>
    <li> My family used Motions products when I was a kid so I thought I would give this a try. It just didn&#x27;t work well on my hair. But not all products were meant for everyone. It might work on you. I say give it a try; that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll know. You might like it. If not, try something else.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. It seemed like it was used. The container was half full which was weird to me; however the conditioner was OK. I think because of the way it was presented it kinda distorted my review and usually I give 5 stars but I have to be honest and say that it wasn&#x27;t all that. Oops try again!! Lol</li>
    <li> Motions Deep Conditioning Masque is a good masque for natural hair.  I didn&#x27;t use it with any of the other Motions products in order to better gauge it&#x27;s usefulness.  I found it a bit runny, but it smells nice and leaves my hair really soft.  I&#x27;ve also used it as a leave in conditioner and find that I like how it performs better with my curls in a dry state.  It keeps my frizzies at bay and holds my curl definition really well.</li>
    <li> My hair gets tangled easily &amp; is difficult to comb thru when wet. Motions Deep Conditioning Masque INSTANTLY softens &amp; detangles my hair with ease. I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Most of the new conditioning products from Motions do exactly what we want and I&#x27;ve no quibble with this one&#x27;s effectiveness.  The main surprise was that this was not near as thick as other \\&quot;Hair Masques\\&quot; usually are.  This Product is about as thick as say, those tubes of extra special between coloring conditioners you get with [[ASIN:B004C0LX6O L&#x27;Oreal Paris Superior Preference Color Care System, Dark Blonde]].  In fact, even the fragrance is similar!  These are merely observations and not complaints.  I found the product very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use on WET hair and then rinse out but I found that to be ineffective.  As another reviwer noted, this can work well as a Masque for DRY hair.  I have very long hair with super thirsty ends.  I also have \\&quot;ethnic hair\\&quot; so washing my hair too frequently can strip it of its natural oils and leave my scalp parched, cracked and scaly.  As a result, every other day or so, I only rinse the days&#x27; dirt from my hair with filtered water in the sink.  The lack of chlorine helps keep my hair in good shape and the water rinses aways air pollution, dirt attracted to the hair products I use, any flakes off the scalp and the little excess oil I have.  That is the PERFECT time for me to also rinse away a hair Masque, so I have begun first applying the Motions Deep Conditioning Masque to my dry hair on one of my in-between washings days, putting on a heat treatment cap and then wrapping my head in a heated towel.  I change the towel after about 15 minutes for a freshly heated one and when that one gets cool, I go to the sink and rinse out the Masque.  Of course, if you have a cap dryer, you can simply use that as the source of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may sound simple, but that&#x27;s my trick and it works!  I do it as soon as I get home from work so my hair can dry naturally or I can put it into a twist set or a ringlet set with those bungee curlformers such as: [[ASIN:B006E4OTTO Curlformers Extra Long &amp; Wide Styling Kit]] especially for long hair.  Frankly, I buy a much longer Generic version on eBay and they work just fine.  When I wake up, my hair is notably softer and not at all greasy.  I&#x27;ve done this 3 times so far but used up the entire contents of the jar.  If I had any complaint it would be that I&#x27;d love to have this Deep Conditioning Masque in a large pump dispenser for more frequent use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to be careful about washing your hair too frequently, try my method of using this as your Deep Conditioner on the days when you rinse your hair rather than shampoo it.

    <li> Never having used a Motions product before, I was not too sure what to expect. I love hair masques, and Motions Naturally You, Deep Conditioning Masque was a great way to pamper my hair. Upon researching the brand more, I discovered that Motions was developed for a different hair type than mine, so that may explain some of the after effects. Overall, I was pleased with the product. I just wish I had done a little more research first.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how good this is for deep conditioning, I personally prefer a thicker deep conditioner, but this works really well for detangling</li>
    <li> I like this hair conditioning masque, really good frizz control moisturizes damaged dry hair very nicely. It also smells nice and like many other Motions line hair product a little goes a long way and it seems to work best on thick more difficult hair vs very fine stright hair. Definetly worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have to say first if you think your hair is going to look like the photos, then this is not the product for you. Th is product is a conditioner. what it does is makes your hair more manageable and cleans up your kitchen areas . This way you can style and straighten it and curl it without your hair going limp. This is a good a product on ethnic hair will balance it out. If you use this eventually your hair will be more manageable as well.</li>
    <li> One of the greatest trials of having waist-length curly hair is tangling, which leads to breakage. I&#x27;ve been literally using handfuls of conditioner and a detangling comb to get the knots out of my hair, but this time I decided to completely skip the conditioner in the shower and try Motions Naturally You Deep Conditioning Masque. I just scooped up the little bit that was inside the lid, spread it on my hands, and smoothed it over the entire length of my hair. The detangling comb went through it as well as with a conditioner, but I was able to leave this in. I have waist-length perfectly-defined curls now. I could have used a little less, maybe a teaspoon or less for a big mass of messy hair. I will be replacing this when it runs out!</li>
    <li> Worked well on my dry, fizzy hair. Make sure you work it in well (use a wide toothed comb) and let it set in for a while. My hair felt so much softer and smoother. I&#x27;ll definitely be adding this to my routine.</li>
    <li> I tried this product about a month ago and fell in love. I have been natural for exactly 1 year now and was looking for a good deep conditioner to try. This product keeps my hair very soft and easy to comb through, and my hair is soft and healthy looking even when I rinse it out. I deep condition my hair once a week using this product and I can honestly say it does a great job maintaining my hair&#x27;s moisture, keeping it healthy, and is just a great overall product. I suggest using this with other Motions products like their everyday hair moisturizer especially for your ends, outer edges, and scalp as well as their Define My Curls product and their Naturally You Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Motions Naturally You, Deep cleaning Masque works very well. This was used by my wife in this manner: she shampooed her hair, dried it slightly and then applied the masque. It stayed on for about 15 minutes and then rinsed off. She and I agreed that her hair was very soft, had a good smell and had more shine. It was easy to use and had no unpleasant smells, etc. We both recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered several projects from the Motions hair line. Prior to the last order, I ordered their curl butter and another product and was totally dissatisfied. With that being said, the reviews on these other Motions products I ordered will probably be the same. I was totally disappointed that an entire line of hair products missed the mark. I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future. Not only did they do what they said they&#x27;d do, after the 1st hour or so, but the residue and build up in my hair, caused me to have to cut sections of my hair to get the residue and knots out of my hair. Out of the 9 products I tried there were only two that did anything for me and that was moisturizing cleanser and the deep conditioning hair masque. These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized. I can actually run a comb or brush through it without pulling out plugs. I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
    <li> Take your time.  Apply on moist hair. Let it nourish your strands and scalp.  Have found this gives a nice lift and healthy bounce to full, curly color treated hair in the ultra-dry wintertime of Alaska.  Am pleased with result. Would get product again.</li>
    <li> These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine. That said, it still does work for what it&#x27;s supposed to do. If it sounds like something you need, then I recommend it.</li>
    <li> With hair too dry to wash often, I tried that expensive and very popular sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner. If you are looking for an alternative to that product, THIS is IT!&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s wonderful using as directed, when used in the same way as the TV one, the results are fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;First, wet your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Next massage your scalp while the water runs over it. Do that for a full minute, just as if you were using a normal shampoo, but instead using just water.&lt;br /&gt;Now scoop a few tablespoons of the Motions deep conditioning mask out of the jar, and massage the product in your scalp and through your hair. Add a little water so the product can emulsify a bit. It froths a little, not like lather, just a bit of froth.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse it out completely and then take a few more tablespoons and apply as you would any conditioner. If you use a heating cap, this is the time that you would put it on. Otherwise, you can use a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse out when you feel that your hair is well conditioned. The longest that I&#x27;ve left it on has been an hour, and my hair was so shiny, and the curl defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light and doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair like some of the products that knock you out with the smell. If you are trying to grow your hair this is your miracle product!</li>
    <li> Having color-treated hair I&#x27;m always looking for that magic treatment to revive my flat, damaged hair. Though that magic treatment probably doesn&#x27;t exist. On a scale; 1 being nothing and 10 being magical, is give Motions Conditioning Masque a 7.5.</li>
    <li> I really like this masque, it did leave my hair very soft.  It smells good.  I rarely have time to use this, because it recommends to put it on your hair and leave on for 5 minutes.  a shower cap is definitely necessary.  I will save this for when I have the time and want to pamper myself.  Works well though.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with every item I have tried from the Mtions Naturally You line and this hair masque is no exception. The 8-ounce container is a nice size and will last for quite awhile. I like how my hair feels after usage. Having color-treated hair, I have to be careful what I use, and I find this product does an excellent job in deep conditioning my hair. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it this works so great it leaves my hair so soft and healthy feeling and just AMAZING the best deep conditioner ever</li>
    <li> So disapointed that motions decided to stop making this line! The combination of ingredients in perfect for someone who over processes their hair and wants it to be and not just feel healthy</li>
    <li> I got this conditioner for my husband who has medium (not quite coarse) dry hair especially in the winter and needs good conditioning.  When he uses good conditioners his hair gets soft and curly instead of frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was very anxious to test out this conditioner and prepared to wash his hair.  When I heard a bunch of shouting and frustrating words coming from the bathroom, I have to admit, I chuckled when I saw him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid was off of this jar, and there was conditioner dripping from his hands all over the place.  The jar was balanced outside of the shower and the lid was sliding off onto the floor.  The look on his face was very stressed as he attempted to use this jar of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test it myself and found out that this conditioner is so runny that using a jar to store it in is impractical if you are planning to use it in the shower.  The jar is awkward and the conditioner does not stay on the hands that well either.  It slops over the side of the jar, not to mention that it is hard to find a place to put it while you try to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are washing your hair in a sink or bending over a faucet, it would be better, as it could sit on a shelf or counter until you were done, and it might be easier not to drip it everywhere.  If you get done washing your hair in the shower, and then want to apply the conditioner to sit under a dryer, it would be more practical to use the jar.  However, to have to go to extra effort for such mediocre results just isn&#x27;t something I feel you should have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, I was disappointed in how it left the hair. Instead of soft and bouncy, I found that the hair is left a bit dry and not overly soft.  I didn&#x27;t see much curl/wave as I expected, and the hair was left somewhat frizzy still. We tried using the conditioner under a dryer, without a dryer, waiting up to a half hour too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of this conditioner seems to be a fruity floral and is not too girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give this three stars as it sort of works, but not with the kind of performance expected from the promotional information. However, I gave it two stars due to the difficulty of using it from the jar and being so runny and awkward.is not too girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give this three stars as it sort of works, but not with the kind of performance expected from the promotional information. However, I gave it two stars due to the difficulty of using it from the jar and being so runny and awkward.</li>
    <li> Directions are too much work, I used it as an overnight treatment instead of the hot air in a plastic cap as directed. It still worked pretty well. Also the directions are tiny. Perhaps I am getting too old to read without glasses, but the lettering on how to use is WAY to small!&lt;br /&gt;The product is also a little to loose for this type of container, would be better in a pump bottle. Open it without keeping it level and you have spilled a mess. In a container like this, and made of shea butter and coconut oil, I expected the product to be a little thicker. Something that would hold shape until it met the warm temperature of my hand and head. Instead the product is loose and nearly a liquid. A consistency more like liquid soap instead of a spreadable butter.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not bad, but too floral for my liking. I expected a product made with shea butter, coconut and avocado oils to have a fragrance that was of those ingredients. Instead it was a bit overpowering with an artificial floral scent.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It detangles the hair and imparts moisture throughout especially when you sit under a warm dryer for about 15 minutes.  It works wonders for natural hair!</li>
    <li> In my (ahem) old age, I&#x27;m finding products like this very helpful, especially since I&#x27;ve allowed myself to become a long hair and still have a fairly healthy though thinning crop of it.  And the aroma isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly feminine, so hey, this is okay for guys too.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife. Her hair is color-treated and fairly damaged so she spends time using conditioners and gentle products that help re-hydrate. We got this not being familiar with the brand and not really knowing what to expect. She has had positive results when using the conditioning masque. It used to be that she would purchase leave-in conditioners at Ulta and salons that she went to. But each of these products would end up costing over $30 a bottle and the quality didn&#x27;t seem to vary. Since this conditioning masque works for her I have encouraged her to keep getting it because it is easier on the wallet. I&#x27;d suggest for others to sample this product because like I said, the quality between something like this and something you get at a salon doesn&#x27;t seem to vary.</li>
    <li> Loved this! It works! Only problem is that it is a bit thin and watery.</li>
    <li> Motions Naturally You deep conditioning masque has a nice scent and it is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  I like the way it nourishes and smoothes my hair during the dry winter months when I often get the frizzies.  My only complaints are that I have to use quite a lot of the product to get the desired results and I tend to waste some as the masque is more liquidy than other deep conditioners I&#x27;ve tried so it slips out of my hands and ends up down the drain.</li>
    <li> I see a definite improvement in hair moisture and softness. Hair tangles less and there is less breakage. Pleasant fragrance that does not linger.</li>
    <li> I usually am a big fan of products like this, such as Aussie&#x27;s 3-minute hair miracle.  Especially this time of year, I use deep conditioners on a regular basis.  I have wavy hair that gets unmanagaable and flyaway in dry, cold, New-England air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my hair flat and limp.  I&#x27;ve tried it seveal times.  (BTW, it&#x27;s very hard to read the instructions.  Not only did I need reading glasses to see it, but Amazon placed a big label over them).  I did follow the instructions closely and still get the same outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I cannot endorse this product.</li>
    <li> Motions Deep Conditioning Masque is designed and marketed for women of color. However, with thick, permed hair and living in a humid climate, I look for anything that will keep my hair from frizzing in the humidity and wind. Well, for the wind, anything short of lacquer, there&#x27;s not much hope. But for the frizz due to humidity, this product does the trick. My permed hair can also get very dry and Motions Deep Conditioning Masque keeps the tight curls soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t have time for the deep conditioning that is given in the instructions. Most days, I shampoo, work the masque into my hair, and leave it on until the end of my shower. I style my hair as usual and it stays soft and frizz-free, even on rainy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price tag for this product is very reasonable. I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son, who has very thick and very curly hair. It works well on him and leaves his hair moisturized and healthy. But it is very thick (which can be good, as this means a little goes a long way, and this stuff lasts a long time) so it is easy to overdo it. It took me awhile to get used to using such a small amount on him, but I&#x27;ve got the hang of it now. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This has natural moisturizing ingredients including coconut and avocado oils.  It definitely increases the moisture and strength of hair.  However, the directions include putting one&#x27;s hair under a warm dryer before rinsing.  It does not perform best using other methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioning masque is runny - much more than expected.  That may be because it uses natural oily ingredients.  I think Motions should add an ingredient to thicken it up a bit to help it last longer.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my five year old daughter who has very curly, mixed hair.  Since this product came in a jar instead of a bottle I was encouraged that it may really moisturize since it was quite thick.  I was wrong!!  I used this after the Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser so I thought they would work well together as a system.  While working the conditioner through my daughters hair I could still feel the dry ends, it did not make her hair feel smooth at all.  Once I towel dried her hair it did not look moisturized at all, very frizzy.  I will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is for so I use it like oiling my scalp with the Deep Conditioning Masque</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a product hound and still trying to find the perfect deep conditioner. I tried this after getting it from bzzagent and was disappointed. I figured since Motions is geared towards African American women, it would be perfect. Sadly it was not. It smelled great but it was a lot thinner than anything I&#x27;ve used for a deep conditioner. Directions say it should be left in 5-10 minutes with a plastic cap on, and under the hair dryer. It didn&#x27;t do a thing in the world. I tried it a second time and did 30 minutes under the dryer and that helped a little. Overall, when it was rinsed out, my hair wasn&#x27;t soft and easy to comb like other deep conditioners I&#x27;ve used. It felt a little dry. I guess the formula was so light-weight that I didn&#x27;t feel any benefits from it and won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> Tried this a couple of times.  My teen daughter with long hair  complained that it made her hair greasy.  I tried it a couple of  times myself.  One thing you need to know is that it recommends leaving on for 10 to 15 minutes so don&#x27;t plan on a quick wash rinse condition and get going.  The first time I did just a quick wash condition and that was that..it doesn&#x27;t wash out that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried again and made sure I used the recommended Motions Naturally You Conditioning Cleanser. I like the cleanser alone better it&#x27;s light and not too heavy.  This Masque is way to heavy for me, kind of like using straight olive oil but not as bad as straight petroleum jelly for a lice treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re hair is super damaged and you&#x27;ve been wandering around the Sahara for days baking in the sun or perhaps swimming daily in pool water this product is probably overkill.</li>
    <li> The Motions Naturally You Deep Conditioning Masque is a very nice conditioner that seems to work great with my African American hair. This conditioner has a great smell and wasn&#x27;t overly heavy as some products that are designed for African American hair tend to be. I love the shine after use and my hair looks so much healthier after use. My hair is usually dry and frizzy on the ends but with this conditioner I can tell the difference and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my other hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is a good conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cost you a lot of money and works just as well as the more expensive products. Great conditioner for difficult to manage hair that is tough and dry or damaged from too many heating irons.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife and she absolutely loved it. It made her hair look like it had a natural glistening look while de-tangling her hair. A nice pleasant smell, and a not too thick and greasy product. If your are looking to deep condition your hair, this is a must have product that works.</li>
    <li> Okay so this stuff has a very perfumy smell to it. Smells great and my hair was always very dry whenever i got out of the shower. When i first used it. I could tell already this stuff works like magic. It felt mosturized and full of life. And looks amazing. And feels amazing. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Although i dont plan on buying next time because it has alcohol in it. And alcohol is not good for the hair. But this stuff is great</li>
    <li> This is the first time I had ever used Motions Products and I must say I was very pleased by it&#x27;s performance. Most of the products are very lightweight in nature and does not go on thick and greasy. Make hair feel light and easy to run your fingures through an not feel heavy and greasy. The Motions Nayurally You, Deep Conditioning masque goes on light, rinses out very well and leaves hair very soft and managable.</li>
    <li> Have an age old friend who is \\&quot;all about the hair\\&quot;. Never satisfied with the way it looks , I obtained several Motions At Home products for her. Mostly I obtained these as a practical joke , presenting her with a dozen or so products at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out she is ecstatic with the results! Couldn&#x27;t figure out how \\&quot;I would know\\&quot;, she has subsequently utilized more in the product line and is looking better than ever---at least hair-wise (jab)</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, and she loved it.  She said it makes her hair soft, and that she would definitely buy it again.  She uses it twice a week.  She wholeheartedly recommends this item.</li>
