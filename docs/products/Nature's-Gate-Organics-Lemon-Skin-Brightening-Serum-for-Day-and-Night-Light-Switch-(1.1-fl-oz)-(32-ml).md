      <li>I am pleased with this product !</li>
      <li>Non greasy, smells great, makes my skin feel smooth, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for my acne prone skin.</li>

      <li>so you need to use cream on top of it.</li>
      <li>I got acne in places that I have never had more than a couple blemishes.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin radiant and healthy.</li>
      <li>it creates a film that sits on top of your skin that when rubbed (by putting on makeup, for instance), makes you look like your skin is peeling off.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this - see a dermatologist instead or get excellent evidenced-based free tips on the Skin Care Addiction forum on Reddit.</li>

      <li>It is so light weight, not greesy and makes my skin feel super soft and silky.</li>
      <li>A Favorite Daily Product.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it enough to be able to say whether or not it would have eventually brightened my skin -</li>
      <li>However, if you are a person with oily skin like me I would tell you to make sure to use this product only at night as it will begin to feel greasy during the day.</li>
      <li>this product really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin at all - it does smell lemony - and it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t know if the acne scars faded because I got so much acne</li>
      <li>They commented on how much brighter my face looks.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Initially applied, it goes on smoothly-</li>
      <li>My forehead never had much acne at all.</li>
      <li>And my chin was always pretty clear, but it broke out as well.</li>
      <li>However, i feel there are better alternatives for the price with less filler ingredients...</li>
      <li>So far I have not seen any real visible benefits after using it for 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>Most women i know, use makeup or at least sunscreen...</li>
      <li>do notice a slight improvement in my skin tone, but, haven&#x27;t been using it that long yet - to give a significant answer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent using it for 2 years... after shower....better than toner</li>
    <li> the lemon extract awakens your face  gives your face a beautiful glow will not start my day without it! goes on sooth and silkly not an oily product.</li>
    <li> this product really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin at all - it does smell lemony - and it&#x27;s not expensive but it doesn&#x27;t brighten the skin -so save your money - as the saying goes you get what you pay for - I gave it 1 star because I had to give it something - would have prefered - no stars -</li>
    <li> So far I have not seen any real visible benefits after using it for 3 weeks. It does mosturize at all so you need to use cream on top of it. It does smell fantastic though. Gave it 3 stars</li>
    <li> This serum feels great on your skin, dries quick, non greasy, &amp; smells great! But I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin with prolonged use.</li>
    <li> I like this serum. It isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy. Since I have been using it several coworkers have taken noticed and asked what was I doing. They commented on how much brighter my face looks.</li>
    <li> The consistency of this product was silky and smooth on my face.  However, it was not beneficial to my skin type.  Within days of application, my skin became very dry.  I can no longer use this product.</li>
    <li> It has the same ingredient as &amp;#34;miracle blur&amp;#34; and I hate it for the same reason...  it creates a film that sits on top of your skin that when rubbed (by putting on makeup, for instance), makes you look like your skin is peeling off.  Gross.  I couldn&#x27;t use it enough to be able to say whether or not it would have eventually brightened my skin - I did not see any brightening the few times I did use it, but my instinct tells me it only attempts to create the illusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades of trying many, many products for everything from acne to wrinkles to dark spots, AHAs are the only truly effective products for me.  Dr. Denese facial pads being the best.</li>
    <li> Does not brighten skin as advertised....no change at all after weeks of use....would not buy it again.  I so dislike false advertising....disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product ! It is fresh smelling ! It is NOT greasy OR heavy in anyway.  It seeps immediatly into skin making it feel baby smooth!! My skin feels fresh and light - not weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;I do notice a slight improvement in my skin tone, but, haven&#x27;t been using it that long yet - to give a significant answer.  I would truly reccommend this product and I would continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum that I have ever used. It is so light weight, not greesy and makes my skin feel super soft and silky. It makes my skin radiant and healthy. I love, love this product, and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff kinda worked. I used it on my face to try to remove my razor burn, freckles, and acne scars. Within 2 weeks it removed my razor burn which I was very happy for. The freckles didn&#x27;t seem to fade at all. And I don&#x27;t know if the acne scars faded because I got so much acne that I don&#x27;t know what is a scar and what is acne. I got acne in places that I have never had more than a couple blemishes. My forehead never had much acne at all. But after a couple weeks, it was covered in acne. And my chin was always pretty clear, but it broke out as well. This stuff must have clogged my pores bad. I won&#x27;t be using it on my face ever again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago and have been using it regularly- once or twice a week. Initially applied, it goes on smoothly- your skin feels silky to the touch. But, Wait a while and if you rub the skin, it will start balling up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 3 stars because it is natural (doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals) and does what it says. If you use makeup, it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea to use this during the day. Most women i know, use makeup or at least sunscreen... so i wouldn&#x27;t market this as a DAY serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works by physically peeling off the dead layer of skin. I do not use this as a regular serum simply because i noticed that the product did not completely absorb into my skin. What a perceived to be silky was actually just a layer of film from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as an exfoliant by applying it to my face, letting it sit for five minutes and rubbing off the excess. In the end, my face glows and has a more even complexion- so it ultimately does brighten my face. However, i feel there are better alternatives for the price with less filler ingredients... ie Devita.</li>
    <li> I used this for a while (about half of the bottle) and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement at all. Maybe it works for some but it didn&#x27;t for me. I finally realized none of these over the counter pricey products will help with my serious skin issues aside from a topical prescribed retinoid, which has helped so much with my skin texture and acne. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this - see a dermatologist instead or get excellent evidenced-based free tips on the Skin Care Addiction forum on Reddit.</li>
    <li> Works better than more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried and been disappointed with. You can truly feel a difference in the texture of your skin when you use this.</li>
    <li> Delightful product that smells great and makes the skin feel like silk. Even the bottle has a nice feel to it when you apply the serum. I don&#x27;t know if it has long-lasting brightening effects but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. The cost is  reasonable enough for the wonderful feeling that it gives to your skin!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s light,silky,and smells heavenly. However,it does not work well  under makeup,so I wear it after washing my face in the morning,if I&#x27;m not going out. I wouldn&#x27;t say it dries my skin,but it&#x27;s not emolient enough to use under makeup,for me. It&#x27;s wonderful for the neck area.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Love the natural ingredients. Non greasy, smells great, makes my skin feel smooth, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> A Favorite Daily Product.</li>
    <li> Would not be without this product. I am out in the sun year round and had brown spots use this product every morning and the brown areas have disappeared. Great product</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product makes my skin feel so soft.  However, if you are a person with oily skin like me I would tell you to make sure to use this product only at night as it will begin to feel greasy during the day.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife. I think she likes it, but I don&#x27;t use it so it is difficult to say.</li>
    <li> Clean fresh smell.  Effective results.</li>
