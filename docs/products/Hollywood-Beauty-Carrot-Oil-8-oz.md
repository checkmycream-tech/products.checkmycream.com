      <li>Just like us, hair thrives in a loving, healthy, and nourished environment.</li>
      <li>I guess they&#x27;d rather you buy over priced stuff so they can make more commission.</li>
      <li>Most girls are probably cringing - but I&#x27;ve always been this way)...</li>
      <li>My hair in front is doing better as well.</li>
      <li>I also LOVE the smell.</li>
      <li>there are better oils out thefe</li>
      <li>LOVE.</li>
      <li>I buy this product all the time love it</li>
      <li>But I would give it all the stars in  the heavens :-)</li>
      <li>I love to use this carrot oil.</li>
      <li>I need to get some more.</li>
      <li>I use this when I am touching up the color on my hair.</li>
      <li>Many years ago a friend of mine whose dad was a barber swore by carrot oil and that was all my friend used to use and probably use until this day.</li>
      <li>Many stores carry two ounces.</li>
      <li>It has a nice and mild fragance.  </li>
      <li>This oil is very silky and smells good.</li>
      <li>I also like to put a good conditioner all over my hair on top of the oil to make sure I&#x27;ve covered my entire head.</li>
      <li>The next morning after washing my hair, all split ends are re-sealed &amp; beautiful.</li>
      <li>I will be the first to say, I am thankful there is an oil with the wonderful properties and low cost of this</li>
      <li>WORKS FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>I have hair that doesn&#x27;t make it&#x27;s own oils very well</li>
      <li>I did however give it three stars because it has been great on my sons hair mixed with his shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have used carrot oil in my african-american coily hair off and on for several years and it works great.</li>
      <li>This carrot oil is light and not scented.  </li>
      <li>It goes great if you decide to mix it with another oil such as olive oil and or whatever oil you may use.</li>
      <li>Not greasy, smells great and my hair is growing way faster than before , and the bottle seems like it will last</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d look like a witch, but when I use this carrot oil it becomes healthy, soft, manageable, with nice waves.</li>
      <li>I have used better hot oils from target.</li>
      <li>This says a lot about a company and/or seller (in my opinion) when they are responsible and care enough to take great care to make sure their product does not spill or is damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair was shedding so much!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve given 4 stars because it really should be available even at convenience stores and gas stations, this product is as valuable as crest toothpaste.</li>
      <li>you will be surprised :)</li>
      <li>It goes onto your hair nicely and creates a nice luster making the hair more manageable and less dry.  </li>
      <li>I am thankful that my hair grows back fast and my scalp is very healthy, but you don&#x27;t see growth when it&#x27;s in the sink.</li>
      <li>I live it on his head five minutes and his head is itch free for a week.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff i use it on my hair and on my skin it really brightens your&lt;br /&gt;skin and makes it really soft</li>
      <li>and I am happy someone sells it since it is hard to find.</li>
      <li>I have tried other carrot oil manufacturers and on top of a sticky yucky substance, they become rancid and stinky right away; not with &#x27;hollywood beauty&#x27; brand, these oils are thin and the smell is to die for delicious.</li>
      <li>I used this as a hot oil treatment and I felt a noticeable difference in the softness in the texture and the manageability.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Growth overall has been a lot more even across the board.</li>
      <li>too - prob not for your face but great for softening up the body - especially like the dry cracked heels, elbows and knees.&lt;br</li>
      <li>anyhow I also curl my hair on almost a daily basis, &amp; my hair still stays nice &amp; soft &amp; shiny &amp; everything.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it as a hot oil, but just massaged it gently in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but you scrub it all over and it will leave your skin super soft and even toned try it your self</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an oil, so obviously it&#x27;s very greasy.</li>
      <li>Will feel too greasy if you use too much -</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
      <li>really appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I flatten it straight.</li>
      <li>It works very well for what my wife and I use it for.  </li>
      <li>I just started using this product, but my hair is already very shiny.</li>
      <li>Packaged VERY well.</li>
      <li>I have seen improvements in my hair since using this although it has made my hair feel very oily until I wash it out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Remember, to treat your hair and scalp gently.</li>
      <li>I use the Hollywood tea tree oil on my skin and really like it, so others may like this product, but not me.</li>
      <li>Normally in stores it is available in a smaller container.</li>
      <li>Used it many years ago and since then was not able to find it until now.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for anyone who wears braids or twist and natural hair.  </li>
      <li>I only kept it on my hair a couple hours instead of all night, got up as the smell was bothering me too much.  </li>
      <li>I have been on a natural hair journey for over a year now.</li>
      <li>what a difference using henna and natural oils have made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>soft supple curls.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and not too oily.  </li>
      <li>Certainly above average it give the hair and body a smooth surface and protects the skin.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased to see it had only leaked a small amount.  </li>
      <li>This really works you only need to use a tiny amount.</li>
      <li>My order arrived within a week, however, one of the bottles was not completely closed.  </li>
      <li>i use it for my hot oil treatment and for my skin.i mix some with sugar to exfoliate my skin.he remove all the dead skin.my skin and my hair feel so soft after use it.</li>
      <li>only grease) baby oil (second best to carrot but no lasting effect) silicone (yuck, sticky heavy stuff that only looks good for 30 minutes on my hair) leave in conditioners (all I have tried dry my hair and make it even more dull) yogurt (do NOT do this, the smell of vomit will give so much misery before you can get rid off it with 20 shampoos) milk (same as with yogurt but less insulting) olive oil (the smell is just NOT for the hair, it burns the hair in the long run)</li>
      <li>Carrot oil has made my hair much stronger and there is less shedding when I comb my hair.</li>
      <li>Since then, I have seen growth so much that my hair is down to the middle of my back.</li>
      <li>This is the very best product I have ever used for my hair, I have the worst freezy hair, if I let it dry naturally</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Was as advertised and delivered when promised. A+</li>
    <li> I buy this product all the time love it and I am happy someone sells it since it is hard to find.</li>
    <li> This is the very best product I have ever used for my hair, I have the worst freezy hair, if I let it dry naturally I&#x27;d look like a witch, but when I use this carrot oil it becomes healthy, soft, manageable, with nice waves. I&#x27;ve missed it for years at the regular stores where it used to be (all supermarkets and pharmacies) where they sell other oils from this manufacturer that don&#x27;t do the carrot&#x27;s work. I have tried other carrot oil manufacturers and on top of a sticky yucky substance, they become rancid and stinky right away; not with &#x27;hollywood beauty&#x27; brand, these oils are thin and the smell is to die for delicious. It just ocurred to me to check for availability on-line, and I can hear the gates of heaven opening and the angels singing &#x27;awhhhhhh&#x27; I found IT!  I have tried all products on earth for my hair -including keratin treatment which works for me only less than a month- almond (gives me scalp irritation) avocado (burns my hair) shea butter (nothing) mowrah butter (greasy for nothing, no lasting result only grease) baby oil (second best to carrot but no lasting effect) silicone (yuck, sticky heavy stuff that only looks good for 30 minutes on my hair) leave in conditioners (all I have tried dry my hair and make it even more dull) yogurt (do NOT do this, the smell of vomit will give so much misery before you can get rid off it with 20 shampoos) milk (same as with yogurt but less insulting) olive oil (the smell is just NOT for the hair, it burns the hair in the long run) tea tree oil (it burns my hair) I haven&#x27;t tried the carrot cream from Hollywood Beauty because I just like oils better than lanolin base products, they&#x27;re easier to wash off with shampoo.  I&#x27;ve given 4 stars because it really should be available even at convenience stores and gas stations, this product is as valuable as crest toothpaste. But I would give it all the stars in  the heavens :-)</li>
    <li> Soap, hand washing and may things open up the pores of the skin and hair.  Are you itching or after a show or swim this is a good oil to seal the pores and prevent bacterial infection. Certainly above average it give the hair and body a smooth surface and protects the skin.  YES it does have an oder but I mix the oil with a lavender liquid soap or oil and it changes the oder.  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! I do not like the applicator bottle because of this.  While I am leaning on ordering again I give this a 85% heads up.</li>
    <li> I have used better hot oils from target. That after a few uses you could feel a see a difference. This did not do anything but build up on my hair, and its to oil to leave on skin if you have things to do are need to get dressed. I did however give it three stars because it has been great on my sons hair mixed with his shampoo. I live it on his head five minutes and his head is itch free for a week.</li>
    <li> Packaged VERY well. This says a lot about a company and/or seller (in my opinion) when they are responsible and care enough to take great care to make sure their product does not spill or is damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product! My hair was shedding so much!! I am thankful that my hair grows back fast and my scalp is very healthy, but you don&#x27;t see growth when it&#x27;s in the sink. So I prayed to God in Jesus&#x27; name and was told to buy this! Since then, I have seen growth so much that my hair is down to the middle of my back. This has never happened before. I don&#x27;t use it as a hot oil, but just massaged it gently in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, to treat your hair and scalp gently. Just like us, hair thrives in a loving, healthy, and nourished environment. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just to name a few, I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil, jojoba oil, castor oil and several others. The Hollywood Beauty \\&quot;Carrot Oil\\&quot; is the perfect oil for my hair.  It has a nice and mild fragance.  My hair LOVES this oil.  I have less breakage.  It makes my hair soft and not too oily.  My order arrived within a week, however, one of the bottles was not completely closed.  I was pleased to see it had only leaked a small amount.  I would recommend this product for anyone who wears braids or twist and natural hair.  I can only find the 2 ounce bottle in the local beauty supply stores.  I am thankful that the 8 oz size is offered online.</li>
    <li> This size is very difficult to find in stores. Many stores carry two ounces. Many years ago a friend of mine whose dad was a barber swore by carrot oil and that was all my friend used to use and probably use until this day. I waited a while before giving this review to see how this would do on my hair. Carrot oil has made my hair much stronger and there is less shedding when I comb my hair. I will continue to order this product and use it as part of an everyday staple for my hair regimen.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was pleasant and not overbearing and I did not find this product to be greasy. It goes great if you decide to mix it with another oil such as olive oil and or whatever oil you may use.</li>
    <li> WORKS FANTASTIC. I would definitely buy again. I have hair that doesn&#x27;t make it&#x27;s own oils very well so this is great!</li>
    <li> I lost all of my hair in 2005 when I started chemo treatment. When I stopped treatment my hair would not grow back around the temple and  the crown. I had to keep cutting my hair back to almost bald to look neat. I thought the roots were dead. I started using the carrot oil at night (in Sept. year 2011). I have peach fuzz; my hair is growing. I am not imagining this; I checked again before I wrote this review.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition - just as described.</li>
    <li> I have been on a natural hair journey for over a year now. I love to use this carrot oil. Although it is not 100% carrot oil, the combination of oils has been great for my hair. I went &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;, no perms or bottle hair colors because my hair was thinning and would not grow..what a difference using henna and natural oils have made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using this oil in your hair car regime.</li>
    <li> This oil has actually stopped my breakage! I don&#x27;t use it everyday maybe once a week. It works.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, smells great and my hair is growing way faster than before , and the bottle seems like it will last will buy again</li>
    <li> Where has this stuff been all my life? I was having problems with breakage in the crown section on my hair. I used this as a hot oil treatment and I felt a noticeable difference in the softness in the texture and the manageability. I did also massage a little bit into my scalp too.</li>
    <li> Carrot Oil has saved my stressed hair! I was dealing with a lot of breaking- due to constant flat ironing- and now my hair looks healthy again! I have thick curly hair- and I flatten it straight. I apply a a few drops of this carrot oil into my hair after styling and it&#x27;s soft and shiny.  LOVE.</li>
    <li> very very good, but should not  content BHA</li>
    <li> I have used carrot oil in my african-american coily hair off and on for several years and it works great. I also LOVE the smell. Ummmm!</li>
    <li> Still using it and seem my hair is shiny looking.</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it on my hair once a week. Helps repair split ends. Difficult to find in stores. Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Used it many years ago and since then was not able to find it until now.  The size is much bigger than before.  The product last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair has been a lot heather since using it. Growth overall has been a lot more even across the board.</li>
    <li> sister in law told me it would work, and being basically bald at 50 why not try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is back to where it was at 35 and still coming back.  My bald spot at the crown used to be 7&amp;#34; in diameter and is now down to under 6&amp;#34;.  My hair in front is doing better as well.</li>
    <li> i hate it the smell. it did nothing to my hair. my boys hate it being around me, they said it smelled like drool after you wake up from a nap.</li>
    <li> I use this product along with Hello Hydration shampoo/cond.  I also add it to hair after applying Organicals Deep Conditioner prior to sitting under hair steamer.  The results . . . soft supple curls.  Every now and then I apply it before and or after hair gel (when I use gels).</li>
    <li> This stuff seals split ends. I usually put it all through my hair the night before I wash it. It&#x27;s an oil, so obviously it&#x27;s very greasy. You&#x27;d want to lay a towel on your pillow that you don&#x27;t care about staining or getting a bit yucky. I also like to put a good conditioner all over my hair on top of the oil to make sure I&#x27;ve covered my entire head. The next morning after washing my hair, all split ends are re-sealed &amp; beautiful. I usually cut my hair like 3-4 times per year (I know that&#x27;s horrible! Most girls are probably cringing - but I&#x27;ve always been this way)...anyhow I also curl my hair on almost a daily basis, &amp; my hair still stays nice &amp; soft &amp; shiny &amp; everything. I highly recommend this product, not sure why they don&#x27;t sell it in salons. I guess they&#x27;d rather you buy over priced stuff so they can make more commission.</li>
    <li> This oil is very silky and smells good. My scalp felt relief as soon as I applied it. I have flash point hair extensions and this is a perfect product to use with extensions. No build up!  I like using it on my elbows and arms for a great moisturizer. I will be reordering it again and again!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff i use it on my hair and on my skin it really brightens your&lt;br /&gt;skin and makes it really soft you should try this get epsom salt but it in a small bowl and mix some of this in their and mix it and when your in the shower scrub this on your legs and body you can add an essential oil to make it smell but i dont  have any so i didnt  put any but you scrub it all over and it will leave your skin super soft and even toned try it your self you will be surprised :)</li>
    <li> This carrot oil is light and not scented.  It goes onto your hair nicely and creates a nice luster making the hair more manageable and less dry.  I have extremely dry hair and this oil helps me to keep it supple without weighing it down.  Will feel too greasy if you use too much - only a little pea sized dot will do your entire head - and I have a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry skin too - prob not for your face but great for softening up the body - especially like the dry cracked heels, elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works nice for cuticles too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to work as well as expensive hair treatments at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> It works very well for what my wife and I use it for.  It makes a great lube for sex and it makes your skin feel silky and smooth</li>
    <li> I will be the first to say, I am thankful there is an oil with the wonderful properties and low cost of this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, IT CAUSES EXTREME SHEDDING, BREAKAGE, HARDENING OF HAIR for me.&lt;br /&gt;Take my advice, find one good product and stick with it.  The saying &amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; applies to your hair products as well.&lt;br /&gt;Have a happy healthy hair journey.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product, but my hair is already very shiny. I think I have a winner! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> It does seem to help with split ends, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  I only kept it on my hair a couple hours instead of all night, got up as the smell was bothering me too much.  I use the Hollywood tea tree oil on my skin and really like it, so others may like this product, but not me.</li>
    <li> I use this when I am touching up the color on my hair. Before I start color the rest, I apply this to the middle to of the hair to the tip. It helps condition the hair that has already been colored while I touch up my roots. My gay boy friend can&#x27;t believe how good my hair looks. I swear this helps a lot!</li>
    <li> i use it to tan with, amazing results!</li>
    <li> I have seen improvements in my hair since using this although it has made my hair feel very oily until I wash it out. It made my bath turn orange as well. I won&#x27;t be buying this again there are better oils out thefe</li>
    <li> i use it for my hot oil treatment and for my skin.i mix some with sugar to exfoliate my skin.he remove all the dead skin.my skin and my hair feel so soft after use it.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have the product. Normally in stores it is available in a smaller container. This will last me for a while.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I did not read the answered questions section.  Carrot oil is the third ingredient.  I was actually looking for something that was all carrot oil as I need three drops a recipe for acne scars.  :(  The label should be Carrot Oil Blend.</li>
    <li> I need to get some more.This really works you only need to use a tiny amount. Its great on skin or hair.</li>
