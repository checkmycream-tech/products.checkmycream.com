      <li>I&#x27;m nice looking, but not a model or the type GQ men follow,</li>
      <li>Think if the soft colors if the beautiful magnolias!</li>
      <li>not to sweet, not to floral, not to spicy,  just the right mix of enticing and wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t work for Amazon, I just wanted others to know, because sometimes the prices seem to good to be true</li>
      <li>It is a lovely scent and my wife just loves it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite and I have purchased many so</li>
      <li>When people ask what the lovely scent is that I&#x27;m wearing, they look a bit quizzical when I say &amp;#34;L&#x27;Instant&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I just love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>but this is such a perfect fragrance to wear at the office.</li>
      <li>Unmistakable floral aspect is my favorite now.</li>
      <li>Presentation is quite lovely.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Purchased this from Amazon, it was fresh and authentic and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Of course, I had been hinting that Guerlain&#x27;s L&#x27;instant would be a perfect fit and lo, the Guerlinade delivered.</li>
      <li>I love this aroma SO MUCH</li>
      <li>great price just love this perfume and hard to find....</li>
      <li>Lovely package and the bottle has a tint of mauve as the light reflects through the clear glass.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s captivating and alluring and leaves you wanting for more, just what a personal fragrance should be.</li>
      <li>When pronouncing the name,  it does sound much better with a French accent.</li>
      <li>It takes awhile, but, later the sexy sweet musk comes out.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this light romantic scent! ~K</li>
      <li>The perfume is very very light in color and the scent is VERY light from what I have purchased in the past.  </li>
      <li>Soft, sweet, tremendous longevity and a definately wearable sillage.</li>
      <li>I chose the refund and will just pay the higher price in the store.</li>
      <li>The packaging is really pretty as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Guerlain&#x27;s LInstant fragrance for years now and it never fails to receive compliments.</li>
      <li>On my skin L&#x27;Instant&#x27;s amber and honey come out the most.</li>
      <li>I first discovered this scent in a spa at one of the hotels we were staying in.</li>
      <li>Not over flowery but has to me a soft light touch of vanilla.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>My absolute fav fragrance.</li>
      <li>When I saw the reasonable price on Amazon I ordered a bottle.</li>
      <li>Very long-lasting fragrance on the skin and on fabric too.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PERFUME AND ORDERED FROM AMAZON DID NOT HAVE THE SAME SCENT I KNOW SMELLED OLD AND CANNOT RETURN</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most perfumes, they give me headaches, I sneeze, itch, have trouble breathing with some.</li>
      <li>but - when I put this on strange handsome GQ men in elevators tell me &amp;#34;You smell wonderful&amp;#34; and take deep breaths inhaling my scent.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is very delicate and reminds me of the scent one experiences on a warm evening when the magnolias are in bloom.</li>
      <li>This fragrance was old and did not smell anything like it</li>
      <li>I love real French fragrance, not the imitation American fragrances.</li>
      <li>when I can it is in high end stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue...</li>
      <li>I have always received amazing deals on fragrances, as an avid perfume lover, I purchase all my fragrances from Amazon and have yet to get a bad one, celebrity, designer or niche.</li>
      <li>It is light and delicate.  </li>
      <li>I was so afraid I was not going to be able to find this!</li>
      <li>It is soft enough to wear in the day but it lasts long enough for a night out.</li>

    <li> My daughter in law loves it and it is a beautiful scent on her</li>
    <li> I was so afraid I was not going to be able to find this! I love this aroma SO MUCH and it remains on my scarves for an eternity. A+++ to the perfumerie!</li>
    <li> great price just love this perfume and hard to find....when I can it is in high end stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue...now I know where to get it...thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, great perfum, it is the perfect gift for every women, I love it, I would like to buy the man version of that.</li>
    <li> I just love this fragrance.  It is light and delicate.  Also, very subtle.  When pronouncing the name,  it does sound much better with a French accent.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents at a great price!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this perfume for several years and often uses it as a gift for her closest friends.</li>
    <li> I have used this scent for years and have always got compliments. When I saw the reasonable price on Amazon I ordered a bottle. It arrived promptly but the color and smell was all wrong. My husband said it definitely was not right. I tried to ship it back but found out that perfume can not be returned. I called customer service and was given an option of getting a replacement or a refund. I chose the refund and will just pay the higher price in the store.</li>
    <li> If I tell you, promise you won&#x27;t sell out and there will still be some left for me when I need it.  I finally found my perfume when I put on L&#x27;Instant de Guerlain. I&#x27;m allergic to most perfumes, they give me headaches, I sneeze, itch, have trouble breathing with some. But not this one.  I&#x27;m nice looking, but not a model or the type GQ men follow, but - when I put this on strange handsome GQ men in elevators tell me &amp;#34;You smell wonderful&amp;#34; and take deep breaths inhaling my scent.  Men constantly ask me what I&#x27;m wearing,  They tell me I &amp;#34;smell like an island breeze&amp;#34;, they &amp;#34;could follow me all day&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s subtle. not to sweet, not to floral, not to spicy,  just the right mix of enticing and wonderful.  Perfumes mix with your scent and are different on everyone,  I found mine in L &#x27;instant De Guerlain by Guerlain.</li>
    <li> Purchased this from Amazon, it was fresh and authentic and smells amazing. I have always received amazing deals on fragrances, as an avid perfume lover, I purchase all my fragrances from Amazon and have yet to get a bad one, celebrity, designer or niche. I don&#x27;t work for Amazon, I just wanted others to know, because sometimes the prices seem to good to be true but they are!!!</li>
    <li> My absolute fav fragrance. And, the only place to buy it. It&#x27;s not available in stores or in the catalogues.</li>
    <li> I have been using L&#x27;instant&#x27; ever since I purchased on  a trip to France with my husband 15 years ago  I am always getting compliments.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was old and did not smell anything like it should!&lt;br /&gt;Beware from buying here!</li>
    <li> This was my birthday present. Of course, I had been hinting that Guerlain&#x27;s L&#x27;instant would be a perfect fit and lo, the Guerlinade delivered. Soft, sweet, tremendous longevity and a definately wearable sillage. Gorgeous combination of magnolia and honey. This is the good juice! My fav will always be Samsara but this is such a perfect fragrance to wear at the office. Just wondermous...</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent.  It is a required purchase when I see it left out on my side of the sink with only an inch left!  Just a subtle hint I suppose!?</li>
    <li> Lovely package and the bottle has a tint of mauve as the light reflects through the clear glass. Think if the soft colors if the beautiful magnolias! The fragrance is very delicate and reminds me of the scent one experiences on a warm evening when the magnolias are in bloom. It is lasting but not strong or over powering it is very delicate! Not over flowery but has to me a soft light touch of vanilla. I really enjoy this light romantic scent! ~K</li>
    <li> This is one of the great fragrances from one of the oldest and finest perfume houses in France.  I have purchased it repeatedly both in France, in the USA and now on Amazon.  No problem with shipping or delivery so I&#x27;m rating it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. I first discovered this scent in a spa at one of the hotels we were staying in. I kept smelling it as we walked past the entrance to the spa and finally had to go in and find out what it was. I HAD to get some for myself.</li>
    <li> I always get the remark &amp;#34;what are you wearing- you smell great!&amp;#34; when wearing L&#x27;Instant.  I feel beautiful when I have it on- so lovely!</li>
    <li> On my skin L&#x27;Instant&#x27;s amber and honey come out the most. The magnolia gives it appearance in a subtle glow as well. It takes awhile, but, later the sexy sweet musk comes out. The packaging is really pretty as well. Very long-lasting fragrance on the skin and on fabric too. This fragrance has great sillage. This has got to be the longest lasting Guerlain on my skin. Try the L&#x27;Instant de Guerlain Creme de Parfum as well for layering this scent.</li>
    <li> FAKE, FAKE, FAKE! Hugely disappointed. Do not buy...</li>
    <li> My wife loved it and that is all that matters. She says the perfume last for days on her clothes.</li>
    <li> It is a lovely scent and my wife just loves it. Presentation is quite lovely. A great gift for Valentine&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The perfume is very very light in color and the scent is VERY light from what I have purchased in the past.  This is my favorite and I have purchased many so I do know something about color and smell.  It still smells ok but very faint and it doesnt last.  I will not purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> This perfume is perfect for day or night. It is soft enough to wear in the day but it lasts long enough for a night out. The perfume will definitely make someone wonder what you are wearing!</li>
    <li> I love real French fragrance, not the imitation American fragrances. I get compliments on this perfume - usually &amp;#34;oh, you are wearing the good stuff!&amp;#34; Expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME AND ORDERED FROM AMAZON DID NOT HAVE THE SAME SCENT I KNOW SMELLED OLD AND CANNOT RETURN SO I WILL NOT GET FROM HERE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Guerlain&#x27;s LInstant fragrance for years now and it never fails to receive compliments. The only drawback is the name. When people ask what the lovely scent is that I&#x27;m wearing, they look a bit quizzical when I say &amp;#34;L&#x27;Instant&amp;#34;. This perfume is so understated that it tempts you to over-apply it, but I don&#x27;t think you could overdo it. It&#x27;s captivating and alluring and leaves you wanting for more, just what a personal fragrance should be.</li>
    <li> MY baby smells so good! Unmistakable floral aspect is my favorite now.</li>
