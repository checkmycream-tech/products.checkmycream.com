      <li>I am a huge fan of California Baby products!</li>
      <li>This lovely scent description is NOT in the product listing..</li>
      <li>We use it, cuz it&#x27;s mildly better than nothing.</li>
      <li>I love the smell it has -</li>
      <li>If you want to try it and the rest of the line, try the California Baby Starter Tote ($28 on Amazon); it has the shampoos, lotions, sunscreen, and more and is travel-sized.</li>
      <li>It also smells lovely.  </li>
      <li>I love this product for my 15 mo.</li>
      <li>I love most of their products, but this one doesn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
      <li>WATER WOULD WORK BETTER THAN THIS</li>
      <li>This moose smells fantastic and is the perfect styling product for my 11 month old&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>It did smell pretty good though</li>
      <li>My two year old son has beautiful curly hair.</li>
      <li>It works fantastic and keeps her curls shaped but not &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; I love that it doesn&#x27;t make her hair look greasy.</li>
      <li>comes off easily</li>
      <li>Really wanted to like it as it is made of natural ingredients, but I&#x27;m going to keep searching for the perfect toddler gel!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really easy to style-</li>
      <li>this - i thing both are too strong for my toddler.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s just because of the special formula making it safe for babies.</li>
      <li>he&#x27;s fine but</li>
      <li>, my daughter&#x27;s hair (2) is wispy and fine and it makes her hair look stringy and it gets tangled by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey for kids&#x27; hair product, but it&#x27;s the best in my opinion, so I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great purchase.</li>
      <li>Works as advertised, Great Deal and Super Fast Shipping Thanks to Prime.</li>
      <li>Pretty safe compared to what&#x27;s out there.</li>
      <li>I did successfully get a Dandy Mott middle part with curls</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this until I got it and realized it smells like menthol.</li>
      <li>Great little safe gel for toddlers.</li>
      <li>Our baby was born with a head full of hair.</li>
      <li>We keep our little guy in mohawk often an this mousse work great</li>
      <li>It is great for taming a few stray hairs, but it is not going to hold up a hairstyle.</li>
      <li>I really was just looking to smooth my son&#x27;s hair to the side, not looking to put his hair in spikes</li>
      <li>I put a small amount (maybe a dime size) of this gel in his hair and it kept his hair in place beautifully and didn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
      <li>and I love that is natural.</li>
      <li>Works great to tame and define my daughters curls.</li>
      <li>We only use this occasionally as he is still so young, but it has the best smell and gives him extra cute hair-dos!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different products for my wavy-haired 2 year old, and this is the best yet.  </li>
      <li>Natural &amp; easy way to style baby&#x27;s hair</li>
      <li>At the end of the day, it still looks fine and natural.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
      <li>I wanted something natural, and California Baby is all chemical free, which is a must for my toddler.  </li>
      <li>We bought it to try to avoid a first haircut for my 7 month old, who was sporting a rather unfortunate mullet that his loving mother who couldn&#x27;t part with his gorgeous locks refused to acknowledge.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, but isn&#x27;t going to hold up to wiggly little ones.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of California Baby, and I love that I can feel comfortable using this in her hair and knowing that it doesn&#x27;t contain any ingredients that are harmful or irritating to her!</li>
      <li>I really love that this product is natural and free of harsh chemicals.  </li>
      <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t even do that.</li>
      <li>Oh, and this doesn&#x27;t hold very well at all.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really hold a style.</li>
      <li>This is really lightweight.</li>
      <li>It just didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for my daughters curly hair.  </li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in how her hair held styles whether I used this product or not.  </li>
      <li>but I had to pay for shipping, which would be almost as much as the product.</li>
      <li>This is the only baby friendly hair gel/mousse I found out there.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would work better for someone with straighter less unruly hair.</li>
      <li>She has curly hair, when her hair is wet it is super curly but the top falls flat when dry -</li>
      <li>I wanted something natural and safe to tame his hair for our family photos.</li>
      <li>I would rather have it than not given the state of my almost 9 month old&#x27;s luscious locks!</li>
      <li>Why in the world would I want my toddlers hair to smell like an old man??!</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s hair (3) is super thick and voluminous and it isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep it at bay</li>
      <li>Not too heavy, and not too light.  </li>
      <li>When I use adult hair gel on him</li>
      <li>I KNOW ITS NATURAL</li>
      <li>the hair is just soft and not frizzy but still wavy (or curly</li>
      <li>All of there products smell so natural and soothing.</li>
      <li>old.</li>
      <li>I have used this gel on my curly haired baby girl since she was about 6 months old.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t recommend it for daily use unless you plan to wash the baby&#x27;s hair very often.</li>
      <li>Smells great but it will not hold, and my babay does not have difficult hair!</li>
      <li>We have fun making mohawks and whatever other hair styles we can come up with.</li>
      <li>When dry her hair stayed curly and looked like a little perm :).</li>
      <li>so it lasts a long time and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>This holds ok since I didn&#x27;t want hard hold, but the problem is how it dries!</li>
      <li>Also, after a few hours it looks like its snowed on his head SUPER FLAKY</li>
      <li>Let the little ones have a fun time with this one.</li>
      <li>And right after I&#x27;m done with his hair, he&#x27;ll grab his hair and mess it up and cry.</li>
      <li>I use regular adult products now and it does the trick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, just slightly on the expensive side.  </li>
      <li>Thanks but no thanks!</li>
      <li>The only negative is the price, but I am willing to pay it because I haven&#x27;t found anything that I like nearly as well!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really hold the hair but makes it a little sticky till you are done styling your childs hair.</li>

    <li> I really love that this product is natural and free of harsh chemicals.  It also smells lovely.  It just didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for my daughters curly hair.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in how her hair held styles whether I used this product or not.  Maybe it would work better for someone with straighter less unruly hair.</li>
    <li> This holds ok since I didn&#x27;t want hard hold, but the problem is how it dries! After a few hours, the mousse becomes so badly flaky my baby looks like he has snow on his head. Never buying this again.</li>
    <li> Works and smells good! comes off easily</li>
    <li> My husband and I got a sample pack of California Baby when our son was first born and we FELL IN LOVE!! All of there products smell so natural and soothing. I buy the lotions for myself haha We keep our little guy in mohawk often an this mousse work great an keeps the hold thru naps an all. Would recommend this product an all others from this company to anyone. There prices are a little more expensive than others but the quality speaks for itself an everything is all natural. You get what you pay for!!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this until I got it and realized it smells like menthol. Why in the world would I want my toddlers hair to smell like an old man??! This lovely scent description is NOT in the product listing.. It says it&#x27;s a soothing herbal chamomile or something like that.. OKAY! Then I tried to return it and they said they would take it back but I had to pay for shipping, which would be almost as much as the product. So now I&#x27;m stuck with a stinky gel that I won&#x27;t use on anything or regift. Thanks but no thanks!</li>
    <li> I KNOW ITS NATURAL BUT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THATS HOLD HAIR IN PLACE THIS IS NOT FOR YOUR BABY! I KNOW THE &amp;#34;OVERTIRED&amp;#34; SELLING POINT MADE NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER FOR MY LITTLE ONE, BUT THAT WASNT WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR. WHETER IT ASA DIRECTLY ON WET OR DRY HAIR IT DRIED UP TO NOTHING AND WITHIN MINUTES OF MY LITTLE ONES ACTIVE DAY HID HAIR WAS ALL OVER HIS FACE. WATER WOULD WORK BETTER THAN THIS</li>
    <li> I love most of their products, but this one doesn&#x27;t work so well. My son has cowlick that needs something stronger. This is really lightweight. I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve applied it after an hour or so.  I use regular adult products now and it does the trick.</li>
    <li> We loved the smell of this. It will get hard if you use too much, and if you are trying to get a hair style to stay (not a few stray hairs) you will need quite a bit. It is great for taming a few stray hairs, but it is not going to hold up a hairstyle. We bought it to try to avoid a first haircut for my 7 month old, who was sporting a rather unfortunate mullet that his loving mother who couldn&#x27;t part with his gorgeous locks refused to acknowledge. We attempted to sweep his bangs to the side to keep them out of his eyes. This would hold for a little while, but not well enough, and a week later, my little one had a haircut. It&#x27;s a nice product, but isn&#x27;t going to hold up to wiggly little ones.</li>
    <li> Great little safe gel for toddlers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gel for my two month old who has very thick and very curly hair. I wanted something natural and safe to tame his hair for our family photos. I put a small amount (maybe a dime size) of this gel in his hair and it kept his hair in place beautifully and didn&#x27;t flake.  It did, however, make his hair hard and crunchy so I don&#x27;t recommend it for daily use unless you plan to wash the baby&#x27;s hair very often. I did not purchase this gel for its calming effects nor did I notice any changes in my baby&#x27;s behavior while using it. However, it was perfect for the purpose I intended to use it for.</li>
    <li> Smelled really nice but did not hold style at all. My sons hair was still in his face but now hard and stiff from the gel. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product because it does not hold hair in place. I bough it to style my boys hair and it does not work at all. All it does is leaves residue. I end up returning this product and buying a different gel.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Works great!</li>
    <li> Pretty safe compared to what&#x27;s out there. We have fun making mohawks and whatever other hair styles we can come up with. Let the little ones have a fun time with this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, just slightly on the expensive side.  Overall a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells great but it will not hold, and my babay does not have difficult hair! Also, after a few hours it looks like its snowed on his head SUPER FLAKY</li>
    <li> My two year old son has beautiful curly hair. This did not do a great job of keeping it together. It also gave it a wet look I didn&#x27;t care for. It did smell pretty good though and I love that is natural. We went with Jessies</li>
    <li> Great product hold up nicely but have to use more amount than indicated after that, is perfect</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! Not so sticky, No harmful ingredients. Works as advertised, Great Deal and Super Fast Shipping Thanks to Prime.</li>
    <li> This moose smells fantastic and is the perfect styling product for my 11 month old&#x27;s hair. I am a huge fan of California Baby products! Love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold for a messy look or soft spikes and I hate the smell. If you like chamomile the scent wouldn&#x27;t bother you but they only had lavender and this - i thing both are too strong for my toddler.</li>
    <li> Our baby was born with a head full of hair. Everyone kept telling us it would fall out, but it still hasn&#x27;t! We only use this occasionally as he is still so young, but it has the best smell and gives him extra cute hair-dos! It doesn&#x27;t hold extremely well, but that&#x27;s just because of the special formula making it safe for babies.</li>
    <li> Tames frizzies but not effective as a styling mousse. It&#x27;s not greasy though, and that is a good thing. We use it, cuz it&#x27;s mildly better than nothing.</li>
    <li> If there were another option, I&#x27;d try it instantly...but I haven&#x27;t found one yet!  My son&#x27;s hair (3) is super thick and voluminous and it isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep it at bay, my daughter&#x27;s hair (2) is wispy and fine and it makes her hair look stringy and it gets tangled by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products for my wavy-haired 2 year old, and this is the best yet.  I wanted something natural, and California Baby is all chemical free, which is a must for my toddler.  The gel isn&#x27;t sticky or crunchy, as long as you don&#x27;t use a ton of it.  It&#x27;s also really easy to style- the hair is just soft and not frizzy but still wavy (or curly if that&#x27;s your hair type).  I also read a review that it smells bad, but I love the smell; it&#x27;s aromatherapy, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell once it&#x27;s in his hair.  It&#x27;s a little pricey for kids&#x27; hair product, but it&#x27;s the best in my opinion, so I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  If you want to try it and the rest of the line, try the California Baby Starter Tote ($28 on Amazon); it has the shampoos, lotions, sunscreen, and more and is travel-sized.</li>
    <li> Works great to tame and define my daughters curls. A little goes a long way so it lasts a long time and is reasonably priced. Plus is creates a soft touchable hold, not a crusty and hard hold like some other products. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Natural &amp; easy way to style baby&#x27;s hair ☺️</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to.  Not too heavy, and not too light.  Makes your youngster look great.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the only baby friendly hair gel/mousse I found out there. It doesn&#x27;t really hold the hair but makes it a little sticky till you are done styling your childs hair. In fifteen minutes or so the hold is gone but I am thankful that it doesn&#x27;t make the hair overly sticky or bad looking. I am not a fan of the smell that it eminates but it is supposedly calming.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the shortcomings I have faced I would rather have it than not given the state of my almost 9 month old&#x27;s luscious locks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product. I was going to put it on my baby but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like a baby. I wouldn&#x27;t even put it on myself.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this to gel my son&#x27;s hair (he&#x27;s 16 months), he would scream and try to run away. And right after I&#x27;m done with his hair, he&#x27;ll grab his hair and mess it up and cry. He hates this smell! When I use adult hair gel on him he&#x27;s fine but every time I use this he cries. To me it smells like a minty soured lavender, maybe I got a bad tube? :( Anyhow, won&#x27;t be using this anymore. Really wanted to like it as it is made of natural ingredients, but I&#x27;m going to keep searching for the perfect toddler gel! Oh, and this doesn&#x27;t hold very well at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this gel on my curly haired baby girl since she was about 6 months old. I am a huge fan of California Baby, and I love that I can feel comfortable using this in her hair and knowing that it doesn&#x27;t contain any ingredients that are harmful or irritating to her! It works fantastic and keeps her curls shaped but not &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; I love that it doesn&#x27;t make her hair look greasy. It smells wonderful as well! After her bath, I just put a little bit throughout her hair when it is still damp. I also use it on my son&#x27;s hair as a styling gel. I spray his hair with a water bottle, comb it, and put just a tiny bit of the gel throughout his hair to hold the style. I think it holds very well without being too stiff. The only negative is the price, but I am willing to pay it because I haven&#x27;t found anything that I like nearly as well!</li>
    <li> Good little gel without all of the bad stuff adult gel has.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has regular Caucasian hair.  It smells nice, but it has no hold.  Mohawks were a no go.  I did successfully get a Dandy Mott middle part with curls but it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I use it to texture my daughter&#x27;s curls and to hold her baby hairs when I put her hair up.  At the end of the day, it still looks fine and natural.  Not sticky whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Love it best product for my son curly  hair</li>
    <li> I love this product for my 15 mo. old. She has curly hair, when her hair is wet it is super curly but the top falls flat when dry - so I used hardly any (maybe half a dime size) squirt of this mousse on her wet hair. When dry her hair stayed curly and looked like a little perm :). Only use a bit or I can see how this could make hair look stiff and weird. I love the smell it has - I also used the conditioner and shampoo which smelled awesome :).</li>
    <li> The stuff smells very nice but it doesn&#x27;t really hold a style. I really was just looking to smooth my son&#x27;s hair to the side, not looking to put his hair in spikes but it really doesn&#x27;t even do that.</li>
