      <li>The perfect accessory for Movember.</li>
      <li>Very nice brush for husband&#x27;s mustache.  </li>
      <li>:) it does a good job grooming my mustache and beard!</li>
      <li>Stern brush, perfect for moustache and full beards.</li>
      <li>Perfect, exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Brush doesn&#x27;t penetrate fully into the beard to be effective.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a very comfortable size.  </li>
      <li>This brush more than amply fills the void.</li>
      <li>The bristles are excellent, however the plastic is INCREDIBLY fragile.</li>
      <li>I love this mustache brush because it is compact and comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>but when I finally got it worked great.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I am pretty sure I could trim my mustache, collect the hair, and use the hair to make a stiffer brush than this.</li>
      <li>It has good bristles, and is just the right size for proper grooming.</li>
      <li>One thing though is it came with a musty smell that took about a week worth of washing and rinsing and drying to get rid of.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got just the right amount of firmness to groom a mustached well without scratching my face like some do.  </li>
      <li>This was my first brush and its a bit flimsy and you cannot use it to apply wax</li>
      <li>I wear a full thick beard during the winter and this does a great job of keeping my wild stache at bay.  </li>
      <li>Great little brush to keep in the shower for the daily trimming routine.</li>
      <li>Unusual in my experience because I have boar bristle hair brushes, shaving brushes and body brushes and never notice that before.</li>
      <li>and I was hoping for a medium stiffness it works to smooth out an already combed and styled beard/stache but not to do the actual shaping of said whiskers</li>
      <li>This brush works very well.  </li>
      <li>A decent quality brush.</li>
      <li>very soft bristles!</li>
      <li>Seems to be of decent quality despite its soft bristles.</li>
      <li>Its a soft brush</li>
      <li>The bristles are to soft</li>
      <li>Enough weight and depth to groom very neatly.  </li>
      <li>hairs are too soft.</li>
      <li>This brush is way too soft to use on a mustache</li>
      <li>My first moustache brush was from Hammecher Schlemmer, but they are long gone.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this product and found it to be a great product for a big, thick, heavy moustache.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft, and is a little too soft for me.</li>

    <li> This brush is way too soft to use on a mustache and you can forget using it on a beard. It arrived scratched up and almost looked used. I will keep it to dust small electronics with rather than go to the trouble of sending it back. Spend your money on another brush such as the one from PureSouth Naturals.</li>
