      <li>I guess I will have to wait and see the results vs. the thickness, and in due time to decide for a reorder if it really works.</li>

    <li> Removed dark spots quick !</li>
    <li> The texture is really thick?? Why?? Anybody no why? First ever for me for a cream so thick, felt odd and yucky at first. I guess I will have to wait and see the results vs. the thickness, and in due time to decide for a reorder if it really works.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize there is mineral oil, which is not good.  Would order again if they take&lt;br /&gt;out the mineral oil!</li>
    <li> Does what was expected</li>
    <li> Great consistency, goes on smooth. Have been using this cream for about 3 months. Bought extra to never run out!</li>
    <li> This cream is good for scratches and scars and it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> Super good product ... im going to continue using it. It has improved my skin tone.  Buy it ! ♡</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff, I honestly have no idea what it is supposed to do... lol</li>
    <li> My hubby and I swear by this, he has psoriasis, all the creams and pills the doctor prescribed did nothing got years. He had a large patch in his knee within in year almost completely gone, 2 years later gone, had tried other brands, this is the BEST!!, we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> When I lived near the US border of Mexico, I would make trips to the pharmacies in Mexico.  I bought a Concha Nacar cream at these pharmacies that was amazing for fading age spots.  I have since moved away and was looking for a Concha Nacar cream that could compare to the one I originally bought.  This one has a different consistency, it smells good.  But: after three months of use I see almost no difference in the age spots.  Concha Nacar, made from mother of pearl, mixed with other ingredients can be a very effective skin cream.  This one doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> Still trying it out and have ordered more to remove a few dark &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; from hands. Let&#x27;s see what happens.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much and recomended to my friends. Definately I am going to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> The Grisi Cream Concha Nacar is an excellent face cream to use for dry skin.  Great for removing makeup or rejuvenating the skin after washing your face.  Great product.</li>
    <li> 93 year old mother swears by it.</li>
    <li> Like the consistency of it I use along with the soap for better results good product doesn&#x27;t fade dark spots fast but makes skin feel and look great.</li>
    <li> I did know the product, that is why I choosed it.&lt;br /&gt;Any product may be just a bit better or cheaper.</li>
    <li> I discovered the Grisi brand in the ethnic section of our local supermarket.  I bought the body lotion ($4.29 for 13.5 oz.)  and it came with a bonus bar of soap - both Concha Nacar (mother of pearl).  I love the lotion....it has the nicest soft, clean scent.  I use the soap on my body and face.  In just a few days I swear my face is more even toned.  So today, I bought the matching face cream (above) and it also came with a bonus bar of soap!  I love the products but they are SO overpriced on Amazon.  I only paid $2.99 for the 3.3oz cream with the soap.  My plan is to keep washing my face with the soap and use the face cream at night.  I have not seen a lighter-weight face moisturizer, but I will see how it goes.  So far, so good and I love the feel, scent and results of the Concha Nacar products!</li>
    <li> This goes on easy, it&#x27;s not heavy and feels good on the skin.  Not sure if I look any younger yet.  haha</li>
    <li> This ws not the FACE cream I expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last few weeks, it smells good, I was hoping it would have that same consistency or look cream concha nacar always has but this one looks different... I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is not bad at all, it&#x27;s not really working for me right now, but not saying it&#x27;s not gonna work for you either.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is always weird so it might work for you since we all have different kind of skin :P</li>
