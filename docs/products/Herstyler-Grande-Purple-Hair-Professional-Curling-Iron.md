      <li>I thought surely, based on the positive reviews, that this product must be amazing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know what more to say, but this wand is amazing and everyone should buy it. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Everything was fine. The handle gets a little hot but that is the only complaint.</li>
    <li> love it, works well for my thick hair</li>
    <li> I love Herstyler products.  I was suckered into purchasing the flat iron for almost $200 in our local mall.  Then i found this item, which i had really wanted.  It came with a full glove (not those 3finger ones that let ya get burned anyway).  I am disappointed with their &amp;#34;distributors&amp;#34;.  They sell these items in the mall for $99 or more.  Very Unprofessional but now that I&#x27;ve found them on Amazon I make all my purchases here.&lt;br /&gt;-Melissa</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great my wife uses it every day</li>
    <li> This is an awesome curling wand and comes with a glove. I would definitely not recommend this wand for a child even with supervision because it gets hot from the tip all the way part way up the handle.  It doesn&#x27;t put too much heat on the hair though-as always, you determine how long you&#x27;ll hold the hair against the wand (using the glove of course).  It&#x27;s easy to burn yourself when you first use this curling wand so just be careful. But that said, the curls stay a long time and are a really pretty size - not poodle looking at all.  My 13 &amp; 14 year old girls love it and think it&#x27;s wonderful.  Honestly, I would suggest getting another glove for the other hand because the wand itself does get pretty hot. That way you&#x27;re covered!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very hair savvy so I know a good product when I use it, and ladies/gents THIS is a great great product! Heats up fast! You get perfect curls and can last for days! And the price is super cheap! I just hope it lasts just as long !</li>
    <li> Great curling wand. Received as expected.  Prompt shipping. Very pleased With this purchase. Would purchase again. Makes great curls.  The glove is a must as the wand is so hot.</li>
    <li> I own about 3 curling wands right about now. and 2 of them are from herstyler! This is my 2nd one from them and I love how the iron is a little thicker than most but still has curls that hold. I&#x27;ve used the big one made by remington I think and the curls look good and loose but after about a hr theyre pretty much gone! But this one is great, the iron heats up pretty quickly and leaves my hair really shiny. And I don&#x27;t have to curl it everyday unless i have somewhere important to be that day but other than that i curl it every 2 or 3 days. Glad i purchased this and what a great price. The only con i have is that the iron doesnt have a light to indicate that it&#x27;s on. But other than it&#x27;s money well spent!! :)</li>
    <li> The best!  Curls super fast on my long thick wavy hair and heats up quickly too.  Nice LONG cord which is essential!</li>
    <li> Hard to use. Even with the glove.</li>
    <li> Just received my wand an I love it !!</li>
    <li> I bought this item with a free gift card I received. I chose it because the reviews stated it got super hot, which it does. BUT, it doesn&#x27;t curl very well! My hair is a mix of being coarse and fine AMD weather my hair was blown out or already straight, the curls are dull and minimal.</li>
    <li> Barrel is too small, gives ringlets</li>
    <li> I have fine stick straight hair.  My hair never holds curl without a ton of hairspray.  I used to try and curl my hair using my flat iron and would come out with decent hair but then I discovered the herstyler wand and I rarely ever wear my hair straight anymore.  The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t take more than 15 minutes to completely curl my full head of hair, I never use hairspray, and I can even sleep on it and wake up with wavy hair.  I can brush through my curls without losing any of the bounce or spiral.  I just love it.  The curling iron heats up very fast but also gets VERY hot.  I curl my hair every 2-3 days and after 4 months, my hair is not damaged.</li>
    <li> Love it! It comes with a glove- so buying an additional glove (like I did) is not necessary! Beware because the top of the handle, closest to the wand gets very hot!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is really good! It was not exactly as expected because the barrel is black and not purple and the box also looks different than in the picture. However, it works amazing! My hair is really hard to curl since the curls always fall out in 2 hours or so.. with this iron they stay in for a whole day! Unless you have to cycle through the rain of course!</li>
    <li> This product heats up very quickly, but it does not have a indictor light or even a temperature gauge. This curling iron works on pressed hair nicely, but do use the glove until you get accustom on how to use the iron because it actually can cause a nasty skin burn to the fingers (yeah this happened to me- no bueno). Admittedly, after using this curling iron my hair felt a bit soft and fluffy; I&#x27;m not a big hairspray user; I prefer heat protector, so that may have something to do with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> Was familiar with this product before I ordered it. Works great on my long hair and have friends with shorter hair that also use and like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a regular curler to curl my hair, but this wand made it a whole lot easier, and the glove is perfect to get as close as you can to the tip of your hair without burning yourself.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews for this item, I thought I would love it, but unfortunately, I don&#x27;t. The handle gets incredibly hot where the black wand attached to the purple base, so much so that I burned my fingers the first time I used it this past Saturday. I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll be able to use this, unless I wear two gloves, one to hold the iron and one to hold the base. Doing that though will make working with my hair very difficult. If the base didn&#x27;t heat up the way it does, it would be great, as the wand itself makes nice curls. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using this curling iron and it being hassle free. Recieved the product on time and for a great price! But it didn&#x27;t turn on and seemed to be manufactured improperly. They were unable to replace it or send another.</li>
    <li> Still learning go to use these things. Will burn your fingers all to peices</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
    <li> Love it.... One of the best purchases. I had the $130 exact same brand from the mall and this works the same... But $100 less... Very happy customer</li>
    <li> They seen this same iron in the mall at a kiosk and then wanted 200$ for it and we go the same exact one for 25$!  Well I am not stupid and yes I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the junkiest heat tool I have ever had the misfortune to come across. I thought surely, based on the positive reviews, that this product must be amazing. Nope! This curling iron feels exceedingly cheap, looks tacky and poorly made, has no variable heat controls and becomes prohibitively hot... So much so that you can burn your hand using the handle when this curling iron is on.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, run away from this product as fast as you can if you value your hair and your hands, as it will undoubtedly fry both.&lt;br /&gt;Try the hot tools or Remington wands, both of which are leagues above this piece of garbage. Seriously, you couldn&#x27;t pay me to put this death trap near my hair again.</li>
    <li> Came quick. And easy to use.  Love the color! Would definitely purchase again. Told all my friends to buy it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptic I buy this because of functionality but I&#x27;m so thankful i did! I literally use this everyday and the curls LAST! It heats up fast and works wonders with my frizzy hair! It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me a couple tries to really get my curls right, but I love this curling iron! It curls my hair quickly, and the curls LAST! After it&#x27;s curled, I could run a brush through my hair and it wouldn&#x27;t affect the curls at all. If interested, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase. By the way,I almost purchased the exact same iron at the mall...and would have paid around $70 with their \\&quot;special discount\\&quot;. Amazon offers a great price.</li>
    <li> Between me and my family we have spent over $800 on her styler flat irons (the ppl who bug you in the mall). We are constantly being asked to try new products and to allow them to demonstrate on our hair. I always loved how the styling wand made my curls look but the price was just to costly. I decided to give in one day and just buy it $200 but I thought to check amazon first. $20 is what I paid on amazon!! I was so excited that I bought one for my sister for her birthday and planning on buying 2 more as Christmas presents. I love this product and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I dont think it&#x27;s authentic because it doesn&#x27;t have the light to say when it&#x27;s on and off. But it gets hot fast, and i love it! It curls my hair nicely, which is a huge thing because my hair is hard to curl. And it only takes 10-15 minutes... and i have looonngg hair!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it 100%!</li>
    <li> My hair is stark straight, healthy, virgin, Asian hair and typically responds to nothing...except this wand. That is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the glove primarily because my hands are always cold and so the heat from the wand is a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; welcom (pun intended). It heats up quickly and curls beautifully. Careful not to hold the handle too far up though, the heat from the wand transfers to the top of the handle.</li>
    <li> OMG, i love love love this wand. it gets really hot and even for someone as skilled as i am. It comes with 1 glove which is great. I use the glove and its amazing to see the resistance to heat. i love love love this wand, i wouldnt advised leaving it on your curl for more then 15 seconds bc the product is awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> Niece loved it! Christmas Present.</li>
    <li> Works great. My hair really holds a curl with this. I have two curling irons from this brand and I love them</li>
    <li> I know how to use wands and this did not curl lille I expected.</li>
    <li> I Loveee It I bought One From The Mall About 4 Yrs Ago And I spent Close to $200 For it and I found it here for only $20 something bucks best curling wand ever hands down u won&#x27;t regret!!!! It gets hot very quickkkk so Watch Out But It&#x27;s Amazing..  &amp;&amp; it got her before the date it said it should be here by.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and recieved it today, (july 24 2014) and I am very satisfied with it. I have very thick hair, and I was completely done in 10 minutes. The curls it created were beautiful, and with that amazing price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Where the barrel and purple handle meet it gets EXTREMELY HOT... Burnt hand pretty bad not happy about that... Return in progress</li>
    <li> i was waiting for it to come when it was post to come on Thursday never came i needed one so bad for a wedding for my hair didnt come for 4 days i was so mad now i hate it never going to order again from this person</li>
    <li> Gets very hot! My daughter uses it every day and gets her hair done on her own in 10 minutes. she is only 10 years old. Loves to do her own hair now. The curls are tight and stay all day.</li>
    <li> Fantastic curling wand! Gets hot really fast so be careful! Makes my hair super curly for days! I love this wand! Best one purchased!</li>
    <li> Works will and does it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> This curler is the best I&#x27;ve tried, it makes the curls last a lot longer !</li>
    <li> Love love love this wand. I can&#x27;t style my own hair to save my life. I am totally hair incompetent and even I can curly my hair with ease with this baby</li>
    <li> Daughter loves is it and a great price!</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get used to and impossible to curl my bangs with. It does heat up very quickly, and has amazing heat for fast curling. I am finding it difficult to keep a uniform curl. After I finish with the back of my hair I find I need to recur part of the front. I have long,fine, normal hair and this happens even with product. Be careful not to curl the same section of hair more than twice as it seems to just make it straight.</li>
    <li> Recieved my curling wand today. Appears to be authentic and works well. I only give a 4 because the handle became very hot bear the barrel. It curls and is light weight easy tho use.</li>
    <li> Just as pictured. Works like a charm! I love curling my hair with the HerStyler. Keep getting asked how I get my hair to curl so well and look natural at the same time.</li>
    <li> The product works fairly well, however the overall construction feels a little cheap, and the heat protective glove that came with the product is a little too bulky and makes working with hair difficult when you have the glove on. I still use the product though, I get pretty good curls out of it.</li>
    <li> This was great at first and then lost its ability to heat up after about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast and it took only 15 minutes do my hair which is usually done in about an hour. I love it!</li>
    <li> I just love it was money well spended I would recommend you to get one its very easy to use and it creates amazing long lasting curls</li>
    <li> I love this wand!!! Best one I&#x27;ve ever had! The curls it creates are so beautiful! The wand heats up real quick. The curls last a couple days too! I had to fix a couple strands, but for the most part the curls were still gorgeous the next couple days.:) Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Ok... So i have always straightened my hair, and I wanted a new style. My friend did my makeup and curled my hair. My husband loved it. So asked her where she got hers and she said from the mall, she paid over $100 for it. So i went online and seen it, was a good deal, now i used it and love the curls. Easy to use, comes with a glove, and I feel beautiful again. It&#x27;s so a must have.</li>
    <li> Heatsup fast and works awesome ....but make sure to use glove or you will get burned. my 13 year old loves it</li>
    <li> Just what the daughter wanted</li>
    <li> Herstyler always has amazing products!! I am a customer for life!!</li>
    <li> My teenaged daughter has very long hair and it looks absolutely gorgeous using this curling iron giving her nice sized curls.  I was concerned about her burning herself but so far she has not.  We&#x27;ve had it for six months already and it always heats up fast and is well made so we expect to get many more uses from it.</li>
    <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
    <li> FIRST OF ALL for all reading this review this is NOT an authentic HerStyler at all! It does not have an &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; indicator light at all like the real ones do! It does not reach a sufficient heat to curl your hair within 3 seconds. More like 10-20 seconds. The glove is not very thick and I actually burnt myself through the glove! So be careful while using it even with the glove! I gave this product 3 stars because it does in fact work well and does the job but I was disappointed and most of all mislead because this is not a authentic HS! It did ok with my hair and for the price it is the same as any other brand you could get in store locally. Don&#x27;t bad mouth HS about &amp;#34;crappy&amp;#34; products based on THIS particular one!</li>
    <li> Works well to curl resistant fine hair. Could really use a thermostat setting and LED on light. Does what it should, and the curl lasts well. The glove works to protect against accidental bumps, you just cannot remain in contact with the hot wand. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> First off, I wanted a purple barrel, but the one I got was black.  How hard is it to update the photo so we know what we&#x27;re getting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the glove does not help very much with the heat, actually, it&#x27;s pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, with how expensive this is suppose to be retail, why is there NO options on heating?  The only option is deep fried.  My hair is healthy because I hardly ever straighten it and such because I donate it to Locks of Love, but this fried my hair to bits.  My curls were frizzy cuz it fried it so bad and I didn&#x27;t leave the strands in long.  That&#x27;s after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy with it, I wish I went with the Conair or Revlon ones I were looking at.</li>
    <li> Seriously amazing. I can curl my (previously unstylable) hair in less than 10 minutes and it&#x27;ll last all day. Even after brushing, it is still beautifully wavy and full. I am so happy with this wand, I felt compelled to write my first amazon review.</li>
    <li> I love this curling rod! I have thick hair and it was never easy to control but this rod tames it in jist a matter of a few twirls!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron.  My daughter has very thick hair &amp; I had it curled in about 20 minutes.  Beautiful curls! Thanks so much</li>
    <li> It curls and volumizes your hair in half the time a normal iron would! It gets so hot that it creates beautiful curls in no time flat, saves me so much time.</li>
    <li> My hair has never held a curl and after using this wand it has curl and bounce after I&#x27;ve slept on it. GREAT product!! Easy to use, just make sure you wear that glove because it gets hot!</li>
    <li> This iron works so much better than a standard curling iron!  Makes such a perfect curl and for my hair, the curl holds for at least 2 days.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I had the $200 her styler that I bought off of the website and coming to Amazon and seeing how low the price was I was a bit sceptical. When I received it it was in the exact same packaging as my first and it works the exact same way. It&#x27;s the real deal I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not great at styling hair. At 23, I have only JUST learned to curl hair, and this curler makes it soo much easier than most. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s damaging my hair TOO much either (though obviously I still use a good heat protectant mist beforehand). It&#x27;s pretty easy to slip and burn yourseld on it though, but I guess that&#x27;s true of almost all curlers. Overall, I love it!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and does wonders to my curly frizzy hair. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works decent for the price,  it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> My daughter truly loves this wand. Uses just about everyday nice and she loves the purple color&lt;br /&gt;Even her hairdresser has the exact same wand. Very cheap in my opinion</li>
    <li> Great at first like 2 months later it&#x27;s stop to work. It dosent want to heat up anymore . Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This is so hard to use, I can&#x27;t use it too bad I lost my receipt and return label already because the cleaning lady in my office dump it!</li>
    <li> I love this wand it&#x27;s inexpensive &amp; works wonders! I have really thin flat volumless hair &amp; just 5 seconds on each curl &amp; my hair is wavy &amp; voluminous all day long !</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally straight and my old curling iron wouldnt hold my curls even with hair spray on my hair. My hair would go back down in 30 min. but this curling iron I love it, it holds my curls and I dont need hair spray. Glad I bought it. The shipping was fast love it.</li>
    <li> This wand is absolutely &amp;#34;wanderful&amp;#34; haha it gets super hot which holds my hair better and Is my favorite color</li>
    <li> Heats fast and hot..my THICK hair holds the curl for a couple of days! I&#x27;ve had a different brand and liked it, but I LOVE this one!</li>
    <li> Great Deal for a great product</li>
    <li> Although it is not a brand name it does get the job done &amp; i love it because i got for half the price!!!</li>
    <li> The quality is good and it is easy to use. My daughter is having a great time using this curling iron.</li>
    <li> Bought for my teenage daughter who has thick hair.  Works good for her.</li>
    <li> I love my curler just wish it had an adjustable heat setting</li>
