<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This machine isnt professional at all.</li>
    <li> I was a good machine. But it did loosen the wire near the  drill shaft and i could not use it. But I am going to try to send it back for repair. Let&#x27;s see how that goes.</li>
    <li> Do the job that they were bought for</li>
    <li> I love this machine!!!! I had a professional system prior to this one and it was not even close to the quality of this new system.  It works so well I can&#x27;t believe it was a quarter of the price for a cheaper version at the local beauty supply.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a minute but without a pedal to control the use, the device gets really hot and mine ended up shorting out.. had it for maybe two months :/  read another post that said the same about it but i opted to try it out anyway for the price.. you get what you pay for ultimately.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my daughter-in-law.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this drill. It gets the job done! No complaints my way!! Saves me so much time!!</li>
    <li> the first time that I  order this it worked good the second time I use it the electric drill stop working I informed the company they sent a new power pack. that still works but the drill still stops when it wants. The company did return me a new power pack but it must have been the drill because it still stops when it wants</li>
    <li> I have problem toe nails which do not respond to ordinary nail files. The Vogue Professional does the job well, A little bit of practice is required to get the best results from the file bits included.</li>
    <li> It is quieter then my other one I like it I just hope it lasts longer then my other one</li>
    <li> Love love love my professional kit no more spending unnecessary money @nail salon</li>
    <li> very useful but some of the bits do not fit the machine.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a few weeks now since my last drill literally fell apart when trying to get the bit in (had my last drill for 3 years). I love how it is easy to change bits. No screwing or unscrewing. Just pop in and pull out. Very smooth also when I am using it. More compact but still has the power to back it up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for husband who has problems with his nails getting very thick.  He absolutely loves this product.  It is much better than another nail device he bought a few years back.  That was battery operated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but so far I love it. I do my own acrylics and this drill is great. I really like that it has a switch so that it&#x27;s normal when you work on either hand. Very convenient. I will say, though, that it does tend to get pretty warm - the box, not the drill. Even if you aren&#x27;t working with the drill and you just have it plugged in, it stays warm. I try to unplug it in between both hands so it can rest. Minimal vibration, doesn&#x27;t tire my hands out. So far, great drill for the price, definitely!&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve had it for a couple years now - and it still works fine! I&#x27;ve noticed that if I run it too long, it will stop working for a while, but now that I&#x27;m better at nails, I don&#x27;t have that problem because I don&#x27;t need excessive filling to fix my application mistakes lol I love this little guy! Bear in mind, that I&#x27;ve only done my nails about every 2 weeks and a few clients here and there, so it&#x27;s fab for home use.</li>
    <li> Will be returning it. It&#x27;s  the second one like this that stopped working with only a couple uses. Don&#x27;t buy it,</li>
    <li> Very nice manicure set.</li>
    <li> I used this machine 1x to do my toenails only, &amp; it died. Since over was just over 30 days from date of purchase, I cannot return to Amazon or warranty void. So, I have to pay (according to the 6 mo warranty) not only to ship it back, but enclose a $20 check or money order to cover cost to send fixed item back to me, insurance, &amp; handling, or $30 for same &amp; to get 1 year warranty. What a rip off!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say I was skeptical because it was so affordable.  I do my own nails and that of my daughter to save money. We are both nail biters and both wanted acrylics. It became very costly to keep up 2 sets every few weeks.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and speed of this drill.  I have been able to get my nails exactly the way I want them with it.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am very new using this but it is just as good as what the Salons have.</li>
    <li> The last nail drill I got was a lot cheaper but it was a real piece of junk, it only lasted about a year and then one day while using it the thing just died, couldn&#x27;t get it to work at all.  I hunted on Amazon and decided on this one because it had a lot more favorable reviews than most.  Well, I tried it... the very first bit I tried to put in it wouldn&#x27;t even fit, but the other ones did, go figure!?!?  I wasn&#x27;t too happy about that... but because I&#x27;ve had a couple of these machines, I still have a lot of bits and they fit this one too, so I can deal with it.  I used it on my finger nails and toe nails.... and it did a great job, so I can&#x27;t say anything else except that I like it.  We&#x27;ll see how things go and if it lasts longer than my other ones I&#x27;ll give it a five.</li>
    <li> iv used it a few times already it works great! I was worried for the price it wouldn&#x27;t be what I wanted but it was exactly what I wanted! I love this drill so perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a nail drill in the past (from walmart) and it so crappy so of course I was very skeptical about ordering another one without actually seeing it in person but I went ahead and order it anyway. I was NOT disappointed! This thing works like the ones that were used when I got my nails done professionally. For the price it is WELL WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> i was so excited to get this my mom ordered this for me!!!! i used it last night for the first time on a friends acrylic it was super easy to figure out and use great for beginners like myself! :) and it comes with a few drill bits they fit nice and snug so no slipping while filling!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to do a complete set of nails with this but tried it out in areas that needed a little touch up and it worked great so far.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I just did a test on a fake acrylic nail, and it seems to work very well.</li>
    <li> when we had clinics do our feet i kept watching how they did it.  when the clinics stopped, i found our Vogue Professional dremel tool the perfect tool to do the work myself.  The different sized tips were great for working with problems under the toes.  the sanding setup was perfect for working with cracked heels, sides and bottoms that had extra dry skin and was rough.   when we went to see the podiatrist i told him i did the feet and he told i did as good as his practice does it.  one other mention, when the mrs had a wart under her big toe, and even with removal the toe requires attention, the vogue did just fine and i used the tapered tips.  our&#x27;s still run but the wiring has gotten wore at the hand device.  we would purchase another one of these again as there is no way you can provide the care the both of need by hand.</li>
    <li> Strong buy.I would recommend this product,met all mine expectation,came as described,well worth the money.Easy to work with,simple and efficient,happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought one a year ago for alot less, so when it gave out, I spent a little more, and have not been sorry in the least!!</li>
    <li> After 3 uses it would not work anymore.</li>
    <li> I like this manicure and pedicure set.  It made doing my nails really easy.  It&#x27;s much nicer than other sets I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> I started doing my own artificial nails, and a electric manicure drill is almost a must.  This drill was lower priced than others, while still being a high quality item.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Second elec file I bought thru Amazon. First one didn&#x27;t turn on and I wasted $15. This one works perfectly. Adjust the speed and direction of spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and can&#x27;t speak towards the reliability of it in the long term, but it&#x27;s works well for my needs.  I bought it cuz a nail had fallen off and I was having trouble filing &amp; smoothing the new one growing in.  This electric nail file smoothed my new nail  and I&#x27;ve used it on my other fingernails and toenails.  This gets rid of hang nails, cuticles, and rough skin around the nails; no matter what type of regular nail file I used, I just couldn&#x27;t get my nails to look good ..........  until now.  I can&#x27;t imagine why I didn&#x27;t get one of these before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ability to control the speed of this electric nail file, admittedly, I used it mostly on a low speed, but I did turn it up to see how fast it go would go.  It was easy to switch out the different bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got this and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s well worth the price and does the job well. It was at my door in a day. Well made and appears as if it will last a long time. I would like it if I could use it without being plugged in, however I knew that when I bought it. I do have another well made pedi/medi which I can use without being plugged in and it works really well and I purchased that here on Amazon. I bought this because it doesn&#x27;t need a charge and will always be available. No need for paying for frequent pedicures and manicures, however, I still go out for one to save time, and as a treat when I&#x27;ve been good...Lol!</li>
    <li> this one has lots of power so be careful, but it is wonderful for pedicures and for gentle gel filing between manicures.</li>
    <li> I recieved the item in the amount of time that i was told i would get it, so far the item is working the way that it should, but I also haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it the way I want to yet.....so we shall see</li>
    <li> does what I want it to. I have tried it on my small dogs and does a good job on them also.</li>
    <li> Wow it works great I have no problems with it so far. It was worth every penny</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this.  Its perfect and works like a professional manicure.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It works and you get what you pay for. The tips were cheap and one of them was defective. I used it to remove a full acrylic set of nails and it got the job done. If it lasts for a year or more it was worth it. time will tell. The speed control knob was critical so I&#x27;m glad it had that feature. Especially because acrylic and UV gels have different hardness so speed control and tip options are important. I wish there was an upgraded version with better attachment tips for a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> I bought this to grind my dogs nails. It was great. Easy to use and it is quiet so the dogs didnt freak out like they did with the dermal tool</li>
    <li> I use it to trim my dog&#x27;s nails</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY IT!  My original purchase was May 2014, approx. ONE YEAR AGO.  I&#x27;m writing this on July 7th, 2015 and IT QUIT WORKING about three+ weeks ago.  While I was using it, it started to rattle inside a little.  That was about 1.5 months ago.  The rattle got louder and louder over about a 2-3 week period of time.  Mind you, I only used this 1x a month for 15-20 minutes trimming my toe nails and hard skin on my feet.  ***POOF*** It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I was so frustrated I just tossed it in the garbage so it&#x27;s gone.  I just ordered a Dremel 4000 kit which I can use on my feet, my 3 year old English Springer Spaniels toe nails and maybe even carve a pumpkin with it.  And, I&#x27;ll use it on wood projects, glass, aluminum etc.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS Vogue &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; Nail Kit...It&#x27;s J.U.N.K.  If the company sends me a new one, I&#x27;ll retract my &amp;#34;Re-Review!&amp;#34;  (c~;</li>
    <li> works well,shipped fast.good buy</li>
    <li> In less than five months this crap stop wrk waste a time</li>
    <li> Great model. Love this item</li>

    <li> I love it and it works well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic gadget, the answer to thickening toenails as I age.  I even used it to refine the fit of a denture!</li>
    <li> I love this! I can save money now by doing my own pedicure at home. So glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> Work good on acrylic and regular nails first time using a drill was very easy to use for a beginner. If you look for a drill this will do the job.</li>
    <li> it work, but not that great!</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it was a fair price for all that comes with this! I love this system, it makes my job tons easier! I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys doing manicures and is looking for the best deal for a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Perfect condition and good quality!</li>
    <li> I received the vogue professional manicure and pedicure machine within a reasonable about of time, it was packaged well. I have used it multiple times and it works very well. I am very pleased with it as it saves me money and time at the salon. I have had several of the mani/pedi machines that can be purchased in local stores, I am hoping that the vogue professional will outlast those. If you are in need of a mani/pedi machine I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started doing my own acrylics.  This is a powerful machine.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an older guy and I had some really thick toenails and boy does it do a nice job of grinding them down and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about using a toenail clipper. I love it</li>
    <li> I have only had my drill for a month and a half and have used it maybe 10 times... Well now it won&#x27;t turn on. I loved this drill until now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cool machine, Thanks for delivery on time and good price!</li>
    <li> it works but Is to rough on the nail bed</li>
    <li> Quality, price and service as expected</li>
    <li> I works very well, only thing I would suggest is that it had a nob on it to tighten the bits on. All around it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!! Such a great buy! It works perfect and goes all different speeds... From super slow to extremely fast and everywhere in between! I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I only gave it three stars because it came to me used and the description did not say that it was used!!!! But all in all it was a good beginner nail drill</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller</li>
    <li> when I bought this drill I really like it from day one. It not really noisy and it does a great job with very little vibration on your hand. For the price this drill is worth it. perfect for first drill.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little vintage and the pieces that come with it are pretty crummy. Also, a piece fell apart and I had to fix it immediately (this was right after I got it too), so overall - meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it has to, however, at a competitive price, so it has that going for it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work just fine for an amateur like myself.  Now I need to go to beauty school to really learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> This nail drill works great does exactly what it says it does. lots of power easy to use. just like in a nail shop</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned manicure machines before, one I loved (became obsolete) and the other I hated (had no power). This one has more than enough power and I love that you can adjust the speed to exactly what you want (not preset speeds).  It&#x27;s so easy to use that it really doesn&#x27;t need instructions. I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for years so I&#x27;m pretty fast at it but it still takes a lot of time because I build them rather than use tips. This cuts my time down tremendously.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that, in my opinion, the cords are too short.  You have to be very close to an outlet and the machine has to sit very close to the handset. However despite that minor inconvenience it&#x27;s worth every penny and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Start at a very slow setting and work your way up so you don&#x27;t cut your skin by mistake. The machine&#x27;s high speed is difficult to control without practice.</li>
    <li> Drill handle broke after maybe 5 uses</li>
    <li> Did not come with instructions &amp; information on re-ordering sanders. Works fine though...very sturdy.</li>
    <li> fuctional,and durball, no problems with device</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this project. It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!  It got here so quickly.... I ordered December 29th and it got here on the 3rd.  The delivery date estimated was Jan. 4-8.  And the drill works very very nicely.  It does come with some drill bits and a little holder for the drill.  I would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I had decided to start doing my nails at home and wanted a reasonably priced, quality drill.  This was my first time ever using one of these, and was a little concerned about hard it was going to be.  The box contained the power source, the drill handle, drill stand and 5 drill bits.  The drill worked fine - I had no issues with it heating up or stopping.  I was able to file my nails without a problem.  The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because the instructions are almost non existent - Basically the instructions tell you to connect the drill handle to the control box, plug the box into the outlet, flip the power switch and use the dial to control the speed.  Just a tiny bit more would have been helpful....</li>
    <li> Works great for doing my acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Very compact professional electric manicure/pedicure kit.  It has everything in it and doesn&#x27;t take up space so I can keep it plugged in on my bathroom counter.  I like to do my pedicure after my shower and this kit is perfect.</li>
    <li> I do my own acylic nails and this machine has all the features I need to make my nails beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is a good one. Best I&#x27;ve ever tried. Definitely salon quality.</li>
    <li> I cannot say that this product is great because unfortunately the company did not provide any instructions or use guides for the attachment bits provided.  I am not a manicurist and do not have acrylic or gel nails.  I have natural nails but my toenails have started getting thicker and growing into my toes so I wanted to be able to file them thinner easier than with a file.  I have no clue which bits to use for that purpose due to the only instructions provided were for the warranty.  I have searched on line for an instruction manual to no avail.  It looks like a good machine but until I can figure out how to use it I cannot comment on how well the machine works.  If I find instructions on how to use the bits properly I will updated my review but my rating will stay the same as the manufacturer should provide at least a simple sheet on what the different bits are used for.</li>
    <li> I have had the same manicuring machine for 23 years, and I was so afraid it would eventually stop working, so I ordered the \\&quot;My Manicurist\\&quot; machine.  Delivery was quick. I have used Amazon about three times for various products, &amp; have been very pleased with their promptness of delivering my packages. The manicurist machine was a great surprise. This machine has tons of power and easily removes the top coats, layers of gel polish, and base layers of the products I use. I just received the machine, so I hope it holds up and runs for a long time. It&#x27;s the bomb!, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is serious about doing their nails. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This works great. I have done my own nails now for a little while. It would be nice if it came with instructions on the tips as I am not a manicurist.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good unit that works well. Variable speed is very good. Variety of attachment grinding/sanding bits is good. It could use a little longer cord -- that&#x27;s why I gave it four instead of five stars. All in all, I am very satisfied. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I chose a 4/5 star rating because I don&#x27;t like how much it vibrates in my hand and my hand is still vibrating even after I turn it off. But I&#x27;m still learning the right speeds to adjust it too. Other than than I like it. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Which is great for the power that it has. I know once I master this machine I&#x27;m going to love it regardless of the vibrating. (and the vibrating is minor don&#x27;t let that discourage you from buying it. It&#x27;s not shaking, it&#x27;s just the motor itself) and it&#x27;s not loud!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice set.  I played around with it once but you do have to have some skills and be adept at using this set.  It is totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> This drill is surprisingly wonderful...it really gets the job done. I was a little skeptical when I realized it didn&#x27;t have a reverse switch, but it works great.</li>
    <li> Used it in my salon works great. Have to keep it unplugged when not in use cause it stopped working when it was left on</li>
    <li> Total waste of money! Stopped working after using it 1 time. Save your hard earned money.</li>
    <li> This product is just what I had imagined with every attachment you can use and then some.  I&#x27;m still discovering new ways to use this machine.</li>
    <li> This arrived promptly and works perfectly. It is similar to the model my podiatrist uses, and they recommended using one. I have problem toenails -- runner&#x27;s toenails to be specific. After many black toenails, I found I need to keep them very short and filed down. I have some very thick toenails as a result of toenail loss, and they tend to stick up and snag on my socks (which creates another whole problem and/or loss all over again).  Using this, I am able to file the thickness down considerably, and the nails don&#x27;t stick up anymore. I have run marathons without any toenail problems thanks to this handy machine!</li>
    <li> this is very easy to use and so glad i got it</li>
    <li> This nail drill is a great drill for the price compared to a mani pro ! Easy to switch out the bits and its a powerful little drill!</li>
    <li> Great little tool.  One third the price of ones at the beauty supply store.  It works just as well as the more expensive ones, &amp; has the same attachments.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on myself at home. It&#x27;s slick and buzzes those toe nails down quickly. This is easy to use and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted. It arrived timely and I use it to smooth off my feet.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and does the job. It doesn&#x27;t explain which piece is which so that could be a problem.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is very quiet,easy to control,well worth the money,lots of power or if you need less it&#x27;s good to.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Great!!</li>
    <li> Powerful and nice attachments. Absolutely statisfied!</li>
    <li> I greatly enjoy this product.  I am diabetic and have a hard time cutting my toenails safely.  However this product makes it very easy to do and fast as well.  For the price it works well and is easy to use taking only minutes right out of the box. It seems well made and has a variable speed and comes with several useful accessories.</li>
    <li> First one for me!!- I love it get to style everyone&#x27;s nails perfectly</li>
    <li> Great product, works perfectly good as said on the ad, and I would recommend this to any new comer on that type of business</li>
    <li> Picked this up because my manual dexterity is getting bad. Thought it would make it easier to trim up my natural nails. However, the tips are really hard to get on the wand and even harder to get back off. In addition, the slowest setting feels like it is damaging my nails rather than aiding in the process. I would only recommend the product to those with fake nails and extremely good finger strength.</li>
    <li> This works great. Easy to use, easy to control the speed of the file.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas. after less than 3 months of only moderate use (on her own acrylic nails only), it stopped working. She was informed that we must pay about half of the purchase price to ship it back under warrantee repair with no definite promise return time. Not worth it.  I gave it one star because she did like it the few times she was able to use it. I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I got this and enjoyed it for six months. It bombed out then. I think some stuff got down into the motor. The bright side is: If a manicurist wants a new machine every six months, everything will be clean, new, and sanitary.</li>
    <li> I like to do my nails myself and this works well for me.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I mainly bought this because I have really bad cracked heels. It works great and really smooth’s out your heels. I think it’s a perfect buy.</li>
    <li> A match made in heaven. I carefully read everybody&#x27;s reviews are just about everybody&#x27;s to secure my decision on whether I should buy this. I gave it a whirl and I do adore it so much. To me it just seems like someone has made a replica of the original put it together and sold it. I could be wrong. I make a point of that because I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to last. But for the momentThe nail filer and I are a match made in heaven. I have confidence knowing that whatever I need to do my own toes and hands that I have the perfect tool waiting for me underneath my cabinet in my bathroom where I keep it safe from harm.  I mean it, I&#x27;m in love with this item. I am very glad that I bought it, but I&#x27;m going to take very good care of it so that I can get the longest amount of use out of it. And the price was not too shabby. Trust me if you have issues with your toes buy it. You can trust this seller and you want this item trust me I love it.</li>
    <li> Great little machine.&lt;br /&gt;Do my own pedicures.</li>
    <li> very good purchase.. just excellent, a lot of power, you can control the speed and direction of the rotation .. one of the best I owned.. great for mani and pedi</li>
    <li> Runs hot quick and cuts off for a while before I finished my nails</li>
    <li> Too difficult to use at home.</li>
    <li> strong and works great. does a great job</li>
    <li> This is the SECOND one of these I have purchased in the last 6 months.  I really like the drill, but I think it is of VERY poor quality as the second one just broke on me after only 3 uses.  Prior to buying this one I had a $15 drill that I used for 3 years.  Unfortunately both were out of the amazon return time and the seller won&#x27;t honor the warranty that comes with the product.  This would be a great product if it was reliable.</li>
    <li> Overall great price and product, everything performs to my expectations and the product thus far seems to be reliable.</li>
