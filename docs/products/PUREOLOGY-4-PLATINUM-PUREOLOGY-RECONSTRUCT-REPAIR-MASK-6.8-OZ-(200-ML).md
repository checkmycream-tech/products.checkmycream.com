    <li> I love this masque and it really is worth the money!  I leave it in at least 10 min and then rinse my hair.  I use it once a week which was recommended by my hairstylist to add shine, moisture to my hair. I do a lot of coloring and highlighting so this helps it between the appointments A LOT!!</li>
    <li> i was not able to track the order, and it took the a full week to get here with a holiday weekend included. the item was well packaged upon arrival. great for protecting hair color.</li>
    <li> I have naturally coarse hair and bleach it regularly. This along with hot oil treatments and the perfect 4 platinum spray keep my hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> Works better than any other masque for your hair and protects your color!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for platinum blonde hair.  Fast service, highly recommend!</li>

    <li> Real pureology, works great on my highly lifted hair. Be careful where u get it though, I ordered shampoo and conditioner from another seller on amazon and it was an imitation. Wish I ordered them from this seller...</li>
    <li> Arrived fast! Great price. If you have blonde hair this stuff is a must! Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> the best conditioner to end all brassiness and smooth hair. Its  deep masque that I leave on for 1/2 hr&lt;br /&gt;Nothing compares to this treatment</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so silky. Love it.</li>
    <li> this stuff is like a miracle for your hair!  I have never used anything that really made my hair have bounce, shine and altogether better texture.  Amazing!!</li>
    <li> This should be in EVERY highlighted blonde&#x27;s shower. It is one the best deep conditioners on the market.  I saw immediate results and after consistent use I saw dramatic results. My stylist (who is a blonde herself) highly recommended it to me and I&#x27;m passing on the recommendation to you!</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this product.  I deep condition with each washing, but she said I also need a weekly protein conditioning.  I try to leave it in as long as possible - even up to 30 min. when time permits.  It leaves my (fine, curly) hair feeling like silk.  Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> The best hair conditioner! It has an unusual herbal scent that not everyone may enjoy but I really like. More importantly, it works so well I don&#x27;t need to use it every time. Softens and conditions wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair feeling and looking like silk. Which is amazing, considering in it&#x27;s natural state it looks like brittle straw. I love this conditioner so much.</li>
