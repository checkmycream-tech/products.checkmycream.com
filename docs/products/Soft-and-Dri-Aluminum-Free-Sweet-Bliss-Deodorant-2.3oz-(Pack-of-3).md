### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great deodorant!</li>
      <li>Awesome!!!</li>
      <li>And I especially love that it is aluminum-free.</li>
      <li>, I tried Crystal Essence Roll-on Deodorant, and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>; This was a good choice!</li>
      <li>Happy with the product</li>
      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as effective as a deodorant with aluminum, but if you&#x27;re looking for something without aluminum, this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I used to use Adidas Cotton-Tech Deodorant for women, and loved it.</li>
      <li>For an aluminum free deodorant it&#x27;s probably the best combination of effective with a good smell.</li>
      <li>I ordered the maximum it would allow me to order, and I love it!</li>
      <li>Plan to order more for daughters and granddaughters too!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating but for the most part it works!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly effective - very effective for aluminum free - but still needs to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
      <li>This was more effective at preventing odor than Tom&#x27;s of Maine Unscented</li>
      <li>This is by far one of the best deodorants I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>I immediately ordered more.  </li>
      <li>This is not one of the better ones.</li>
      <li>For an aluminum free deodorant, it&#x27;s definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Hopefully the company will realize that there is a demand for aluminium free deodorant and start stocking this in more stores.</li>
      <li>It is available online at most stores.</li>
      <li>Lasts a 12 hour shift most days and will very rarely &amp;#34;let</li>
      <li>This smells nice, goes on cleanly, and keeps you smelling sweet, though it allows you to sweat a bit (as you should).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Adidas Cotton Tech is BY FAR the best and almost as effective as regular antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>considering that you can easily find mainstream aluminum free brands for men.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Available in walmart or walgreens for about $2</li>
      <li>(but what isn&#x27;t?), but not as good as the aluminum-free Old Spice deodorants.  </li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t even give a full day of &amp;#34;protection&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>For years I have been using Arm and Hammer Fresh scent aluminum free deodorant</li>
      <li>This is one of the only aluminum free deodorants available for women that works and has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>but it came so quickly, even without prime.</li>
      <li>Works even better than Soft &amp; Dri and doesn&#x27;t melt my skin off.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and fresh, and I actually feel like it&#x27;s making a difference (i.e. not stinky) when I wear it!</li>
      <li>So my sister and I quit aluminum free deodorant about six months ago and since then we haven&#x27;t been able to find a deodorant that actually works.</li>
      <li>Good and works as expected</li>
      <li>It was very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>is supposed to be an invisible solid but goes on more like a gel.</li>
      <li>Soft &amp; Dri Aluminum-Free Sweet Bliss...</li>
      <li>but I have found 2 other products that are all natural and aluminum free that I 100% love and this just doesn&#x27;t compare.  </li>
      <li>It lasts all day and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>This does the job and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>Aluminum free deodorants are usually the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands that are more expensive and don&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
      <li>I used it once -- long enough to see it also wasn&#x27;t as effective as my go-to aluminium-free product, [</li>
      <li>And this would actually be a decent deodorant if it didn&#x27;t feel like it was melting off my skin.</li>
      <li>Seriously,  I&#x27;m not exaggerating.  </li>
      <li>B003FX17KQ Adidas Aluminium Free Women Deodorant- Icy Burst]].</li>
      <li>really wanted this product to work, I have been trying to find a good aluminum free one, but so far, no luck! :(</li>
      <li>Thank you to Soft &amp; Dri for producing an aluminum-free product!</li>
      <li>Soft &amp; Dri!</li>
      <li>The Sweet Bliss smell is slightly flowery - nice but not overwhelming, and it works!</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin, and it keeps me smelling fresh all day long without smelling manly!</li>
      <li>I have this deodorant in power-fresh, and what the other reviewers say is true.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve always used Soft and Dri</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a decent aluminum-free deodorant that doesn&#x27;t smell like a middle school boys&#x27; locker room for about four months now.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not thrilled about the scent, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other deodorants, but it is aluminum free and somewhat adequate.</li>
      <li>Definitely time for me to find a new brand.</li>
      <li>It is also the most expensive but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I only tried it because they have discontinued the Power Stripe and Clear Glide lines</li>
      <li>So if you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend only buying one stick to try before stocking up.   </li>
      <li>Kind of sad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff! And I especially love that it is aluminum-free. I have tried other aluminum-free deodorants, but some just didn&#x27;t do the job and others were just too expensive (Elizabeth Arden). This does the job and is reasonably priced. Plan to order more for daughters and granddaughters too!</li>
    <li> Smells great. For an aluminum free deodorant, it&#x27;s definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch. It&#x27;s fairly effective - very effective for aluminum free - but still needs to be reapplied throughout the day. For an aluminum free deodorant it&#x27;s probably the best combination of effective with a good smell. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was torn between 2 and 3 stars. Some may like it but I have found 2 other products that are all natural and aluminum free that I 100% love and this just doesn&#x27;t compare.  I doesn&#x27;t even give a full day of &amp;#34;protection&amp;#34;.  I like Green TIdings and &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t Sweat It&amp;#34; by &amp;#34;Soapme&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is selling for a horrible price on amazon. Available in walmart or walgreens for about $2 a stick.&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I absolutely hated this. I only tried it because they have discontinued the Power Stripe and Clear Glide lines and I&#x27;ve always used Soft and Dri so I figured maybe this wouldn&#x27;t be so different. I was wrong. Completely.&lt;br /&gt;This is supposed to be an invisible solid but goes on more like a gel. I didn&#x27;t have underarm odor but it definitely did not keep my pits dry. Maybe because its not an antiperspirant and the others were but if you definitely need an antiperspirant then this is not the one.&lt;br /&gt;I bought seven sticks and all went in the garbage after I tried it for a few weeks. Definitely time for me to find a new brand.</li>
    <li> Got two one for my mom and one for me .. It worked on my mom and not on me.. but at least she can keep both.</li>
    <li> Good and works as expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a decent aluminum-free deodorant that doesn&#x27;t smell like a middle school boys&#x27; locker room for about four months now.  This was more effective at preventing odor than Tom&#x27;s of Maine Unscented (but what isn&#x27;t?), but not as good as the aluminum-free Old Spice deodorants.  Sadly, this deodorant had the unfortunate side effect of feeling like FIERY BURNING DEATH every time I put it on. Yes, I put it on multiple times. I though it might just be razor burn + the deodorant, so I stopped shaving my armpits for awhile and tried again. NOPE. Fiery burning death + now I just had hairy armpits for a week for no reason. Aaaaand now I&#x27;m back to square one in the never-ending search for a deodorant.  Judging by other reviews for this product, not everyone has this reaction. I assure you, they would have mentioned it. And this would actually be a decent deodorant if it didn&#x27;t feel like it was melting off my skin. So if you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend only buying one stick to try before stocking up.   edit 8/6/15- Since writing this review, I tried Crystal Essence Roll-on Deodorant, and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect. Works even better than Soft &amp; Dri and doesn&#x27;t melt my skin off.</li>
    <li> Soft &amp; Dri Aluminum-Free Sweet Bliss...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this product to work, I have been trying to find a good aluminum free one, but so far, no luck! :(</li>
    <li> This product works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about the scent, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other deodorants, but it is aluminum free and somewhat adequate.</li>
    <li> So my sister and I quit aluminum free deodorant about six months ago and since then we haven&#x27;t been able to find a deodorant that actually works. Meanwhile our boyfriends are about to dump us and what do we discover?  Soft &amp; Dri! Seriously,  I&#x27;m not exaggerating.  Too bad you have to get it online but it came so quickly, even without prime. 12 stars if we could.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear anti-perspirant and it&#x27;s been a challenge to find something that works. This does. The Sweet Bliss smell is slightly flowery - nice but not overwhelming, and it works! I&#x27;m afraid that the fact that I found it and like it will be the curse, but I hope they keep making this stuff. A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tested a number of aluminium-free deodorants. This is not one of the better ones. Leaves a thick, greasy feeling under your underarms. I used it once -- long enough to see it also wasn&#x27;t as effective as my go-to aluminium-free product, [[ASIN:B003FX17KQ Adidas Aluminium Free Women Deodorant- Icy Burst]]. I&#x27;ve used Trader Joe&#x27;s cotton-based product as well as the Body Shop and Tom&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adidas Cotton Tech is BY FAR the best and almost as effective as regular antiperspirant. It is also the most expensive but in this case, you really do get what you pay for. I pay extra for Adidas to avoid aluminium but still not stink.</li>
    <li> I have this deodorant in power-fresh, and what the other reviewers say is true. It actually works. It&#x27;s not as effective as a deodorant with aluminum, but if you&#x27;re looking for something without aluminum, this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found. It smells nice and fresh, and I actually feel like it&#x27;s making a difference (i.e. not stinky) when I wear it!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! I have tried them all.  This smells nice, goes on cleanly, and keeps you smelling sweet, though it allows you to sweat a bit (as you should).  I immediately ordered more.  I&#x27;m replacing my previous deodorant, Adidas CottonTech; since it was discontinued the prices are outrageous.  Thank you to Soft &amp; Dri for producing an aluminum-free product!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best deodorants I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating but for the most part it works!  I have it in powder scent and it smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> I used to use Adidas Cotton-Tech Deodorant for women, and loved it. Unfortunately it was discontinued. I even emailed the company and practically BEGGED them to bring it back, and they said no. I hate antiperspirant because not only does it stain clothing, I still sweat anyway. I have tried Tom&#x27;s, but it didn&#x27;t work at all and left me smelling worse than if I had no odor protection on at all! I have resorted to using men&#x27;s deodorant but I hate smelling &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking and looking for YEARS to find another women&#x27;s deodorant that was aluminum-free, when I happened upon this deodorant on another website. Not sure if I&#x27;m allowed to post the website here, but it starts with d and ends in rugstore with a dot com on the end ;) It was very reasonably priced. I ordered the maximum it would allow me to order, and I love it! It hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin, and it keeps me smelling fresh all day long without smelling manly!</li>
    <li> This is one of the only aluminum free deodorants available for women that works and has a nice scent. For some reason the deodorant companies think all women have to wear anti perspirant, and in the last few years there has been a surge of &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants. Aluminum free deodorants are usually the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands that are more expensive and don&#x27;t smell that great. Kind of sad considering that you can easily find mainstream aluminum free brands for men. I can only hope that they continue this product. It lasts all day and is reasonably priced. The only problem is that I can&#x27;t find it in any stores. It is available online at most stores. I will continue to buy this in bulk online and encourage others to do the same. Hopefully the company will realize that there is a demand for aluminium free deodorant and start stocking this in more stores.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product</li>
    <li> Great deodorant! I love the fresh smell. It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; at all.  I bought it because I am allergic to the aluminum in other deodorants. For years I have been using Arm and Hammer Fresh scent aluminum free deodorant but it was time for a change.  Lasts a 12 hour shift most days and will very rarely &amp;#34;let you down.&amp;#34; This was a good choice!</li>
