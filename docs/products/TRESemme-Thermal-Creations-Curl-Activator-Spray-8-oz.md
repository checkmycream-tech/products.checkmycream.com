      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>it works nicely on my hair - my issue is that when I received it - it had leaked all over in the plastic wrap and the cardboard that it was wrapped in.  </li>
      <li>Just depends on your kind of hair.</li>
      <li>Nozzle has a nice mist.</li>
      <li>Otherwise this stuff is great for more crunchy full staying curls if you prefer that.</li>
      <li>Have tried many others but none works as well.  </li>
      <li>This is ok but does not &amp;#34;last&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and I also love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>My hair is not quite as curly as i would like, more wavy, but with this product I have been able to have many more curls.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>This one does an ok job, considering the humid weather in NC.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My wife has been using this for many years on her hair.</li>
      <li>I will be looking for another great product w/ a realistic price.</li>
      <li>but it keeps it wavy for about 6 hours... not bad!</li>
      <li>Afterward, I can easily break up the curls with my fingers a bit without them falling out.</li>
      <li>I can get great curl that lasts even into the next day.  </li>
      <li>I love the product as it enhances the natural wave to nice full curls.</li>
      <li>Has a light, sweet smell.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this in a store but haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.  </li>
      <li>stopped selling this product, I tried in desperation to find another hairspray that offered such remarkable, touchable hold for curls.</li>
      <li>Without this product I cannot control my super fine hair for styling.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, I was able to find it again.</li>
      <li>so if you have straight hair don&#x27;t think this product will magically make your hair curl.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;) Overall I do love this stuff as hairspray.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and have found it to be better than many of the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; lines of curl activating products.  </li>
      <li>so this is my new favorite hairspray.</li>
      <li>I have stick straight hair that is baby fine and even using mousse or hairsprays it holds no curl from a curling iron.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very straight, and when I don&#x27;t use any hairspray then my curling iron curls do not last at all - they look awesome the first five minutes, then immediately start to fall and there is no curl left after maybe two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>and spray it everywhere right after the shower, and then spray each section right before putting that section on the iron.</li>
      <li>I follow the directions on the bottle (I figured the TRESemme pros know what&#x27;s up, right?)</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy curly, but fine</li>
      <li>and I actually have more volume too.  </li>
      <li>My personal favorite for every day use.</li>
      <li>Creative curl is the only product I have found that holds the curl in my hair when I roll it with a curling iron.</li>
      <li>This product really helps hold the curls in!</li>
      <li>My first day I wash and condition my hair and then style.</li>
      <li>I do use mousse on my first day however.</li>
      <li>I have very very long, fine hair and a lot of it!</li>
      <li>I ordered an 8oz bottle and the picture makes it look large.</li>
      <li>it is great to bring your hair with waves back to life after using just a few sprays.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
      <li>Actually I shouldn&#x27;t say curls because they quickly fall into waves.</li>
      <li>For my hair style (short and wavy), it&#x27;s the perfect product and isn&#x27;t outrageously expensive.</li>
      <li>How sad that as soon as word gets out that this is a great product, the price triples.  </li>
      <li>so the spray was not a thick stream.  </li>
      <li>This spray is perfect, because it really does &#x27;activate&#x27; the curls, AND it does not leave my hair rock hard or wet looking all day like other products do.  </li>
      <li>Since my hair is fine it does not weigh it down.</li>
      <li>I could not find this product in any of the stores including Wal-Mart and had to go to their direct web-site to get it.</li>
      <li>Last two visits found they don&#x27;t stock it anymore which really upset me.  </li>
      <li>Although this does the trick of achieving that great initial shape, it unfortunately does not help my curls last all day.</li>
      <li>so I love anything that can at least somewhat make my curls last.</li>
      <li>The other one I used stayed soft no matter how much so still trying to find it.</li>
      <li>I like this product so much that this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it from the same seller actually.</li>
      <li>Not sure if I am not using right or</li>
      <li>I even use when I just want to air dry my natural curls.</li>
      <li>And seriously - the curls last almost two full days, depending on the humidity.  </li>

<li> And seriously - the curls last almost two full days, depending on the humidity.  </li>
<li> There is simply one negative only because I was trying it for certain reasons.</li>
<li> I use it almost daily on my long hair with the curling iron.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long in humidity.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m looking for soft hold for curls and the product I used previously I can&#x27;t find anymore anywhere, even online.</li>
<li> so certain products tend to flake and/or turn my hair dusty white.  </li>
<li> and it is considerably smaller than the other 80z bottles of product that I have.</li>
<li> My hair is thin and straight, and this is the only thing that will make curls stay in!</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t totally wash your hair everyday,(I wash every other day and just wet during my shower)</li>
<li> Just diffuse your hair dry, spray, scruch and fluff.  </li>
<li> She usually purchases this in our city but unfortunately can&#x27;t find it any more.</li>
<li> Curls become a bit stiff and last a long time.  </li>
<li> I have thin, straight hair but using this</li>
<li> I also do not have to re-apply throughout the day, like with other products.</li>
<li> does the job, just like any other heat protector.</li>
<li> This product is very hard to find in a regular local store.</li>
<li> don;t know, maybe just not right product for me.</li>
<li> Blow dry for one minute to prevent tackiness, then style as usual.</li>
<li> I have dark brown (almost black) hair</li>
<li> If you spray it on and then immediately use a flat iron the hair will be hard.</li>
<li> I figured that the price is really low (especially compared to the expensive sprays I get at the salon)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> does the job, just like any other heat protector.</li>
    <li> I have hairloss from medications and hesitate to use products on my hair..this product did what it claims and I had no additional hairloss.</li>
    <li> Helps hold curls, but doesn&#x27;t create curls. You&#x27;ll still need product, and tools to create curls so if you have straight hair don&#x27;t think this product will magically make your hair curl. Has a light, sweet smell. Nozzle has a nice mist. It&#x27;s a little sticky after you spray it on, but after blowdrying it for a minute it&#x27;ll go away. If you spray it on and then immediately use a flat iron the hair will be hard. I use this to help style the curl then hairspray to hold it. My bottle leaked during shipping so I lost about a quarter of the product.</li>
    <li> It works better than hairspray and smells great. No complaints. I even use when I just want to air dry my natural curls.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived open and leaking! This is ok but does not &amp;#34;last&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this in a store but haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.  I have thin, straight hair but using this I can get great curl that lasts even into the next day.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Without this product I cannot control my super fine hair for styling.  Have tried many others but none works as well.  Almost impossible to find locally.</li>
    <li> I ordered an 8oz bottle and the picture makes it look large. I compared it to another 8oz bottle that I have here and it is considerably smaller than the other 80z bottles of product that I have. Could be a difference in product that makes the packaging change... not sure.</li>
    <li> This product is very hard to find in a regular local store. It was great to find the product on Amazon. I love the product as it enhances the natural wave to nice full curls. JBunting</li>
    <li> This is absolutely great curl activator.  I love it.  I used to buy it at a local store and was so disappointed when it was no longer on the shelf.  I am so happy I can still get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  I put it in a different bottle so the spray was not a thick stream.  But the curls stay in great.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me when I asked how she kept her curls all day.  I figured that the price is really low (especially compared to the expensive sprays I get at the salon) so why not try it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I section about an inch or two of hair, spray it liberally, then curl with my regular curling iron.  And seriously - the curls last almost two full days, depending on the humidity.  I am really impressed with this spray.  My hair is very straight, and when I don&#x27;t use any hairspray then my curling iron curls do not last at all - they look awesome the first five minutes, then immediately start to fall and there is no curl left after maybe two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair that does not hold a curl, you should try this.  Also, it has a pleasant smell.  I like the hold of Elnett, but I do not like the smell so this is my new favorite hairspray.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product at Walgreens.  Last two visits found they don&#x27;t stock it anymore which really upset me.  I use it almost daily on my long hair with the curling iron.  It holds my curl for several hours......without using hairspray.</li>
    <li> This product really helps hold the curls in!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Its the only product that has ever worked for me! It&#x27;s amazing! I will always recommend this product to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> How sad that as soon as word gets out that this is a great product, the price triples.  I will be looking for another great product w/ a realistic price.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for many years on her hair. She usually purchases this in our city but unfortunately can&#x27;t find it any more. She told me that it&#x27;s being discontinued by Tresemme. Thanks to Amazon, I was able to find it again. Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I like this product so much that this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it from the same seller actually. There is simply one negative only because I was trying it for certain reasons. I&#x27;m looking for soft hold for curls and the product I used previously I can&#x27;t find anymore anywhere, even online. Otherwise this stuff is great for more crunchy full staying curls if you prefer that. Just depends on your kind of hair. I have naturally wavy curly, but fine so my hair doesn&#x27;t like to stay if just a little in it. The other one I used stayed soft no matter how much so still trying to find it. &#x3D;) Overall I do love this stuff as hairspray.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair car products I have found. Since my hair is fine it does not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many scrunching sprays, and this is the best!  I have wavy hair, and sometimes you have to give it a little push to scrunch how I want it.  This spray is perfect, because it really does &#x27;activate&#x27; the curls, AND it does not leave my hair rock hard or wet looking all day like other products do.  I also do not have to re-apply throughout the day, like with other products. Also, it smells great.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am having a hard time finding this in stores like I used to- Tresemme, please don&#x27;t stop making this!!!!</li>
    <li> 1 bottle for $29 is insane!</li>
    <li> Works good and I also love the smell of this.</li>
    <li> I do like the product a lot - it works nicely on my hair - my issue is that when I received it - it had leaked all over in the plastic wrap and the cardboard that it was wrapped in.  At least 1/4 was lost.  I almost shipped it back, but would have had to pay for shipping so I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I have stick straight hair that is baby fine and even using mousse or hairsprays it holds no curl from a curling iron.  Using this spray, my curls last all day and I actually have more volume too.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long in humidity.  I love this spray!!</li>
    <li> If you want great curls this is your product. Can&#x27;t find locally for now, so I ordered it from here. Just diffuse your hair dry, spray, scruch and fluff.  Curls become a bit stiff and last a long time.  I use this when I am riding since it keeps the curls under my helmet, even when heated.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Creative curl is the only product I have found that holds the curl in my hair when I roll it with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> My hair is not quite as curly as i would like, more wavy, but with this product I have been able to have many more curls.  I use it as directed and it works just as the directions say. I also use is as a curl &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34; for bad hair days when it&#x27;s humid.  For my hair style (short and wavy), it&#x27;s the perfect product and isn&#x27;t outrageously expensive.</li>
    <li> I have straight jet black hair that is very difficult to keep in curls.  This one does an ok job, considering the humid weather in NC.  When i do tight curls and use this product, my hair still stretches out but it keeps it wavy for about 6 hours... not bad!</li>
    <li> Tresemme has already changed the directions on how to use this product. It fused the strands of my hair together when I used it with the curling iron. It took forever to get a comb through it and I feared breakage.</li>
    <li> I have very very long, fine hair and a lot of it! Curls are hard and take forever. When I use this with my 1.25\\&quot; barrel curling iron, my curls come out perfectly defined with each strand in place. I follow the directions on the bottle (I figured the TRESemme pros know what&#x27;s up, right?) and spray it everywhere right after the shower, and then spray each section right before putting that section on the iron. To keep the curls from being hard or crunchy, I move the bottle quickly down the length of my hair while spraying, then brush it through. Afterward, I can easily break up the curls with my fingers a bit without them falling out. Although this does the trick of achieving that great initial shape, it unfortunately does not help my curls last all day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair is thin and straight, and this is the only thing that will make curls stay in!</li>
    <li> When Target, Walmart, etc. stopped selling this product, I tried in desperation to find another hairspray that offered such remarkable, touchable hold for curls. Nothing else came close. I apply the spray to the ends of my stick-straight hair after blow-drying but before curling. Blow dry for one minute to prevent tackiness, then style as usual. The curls last all day! Buy this before it&#x27;s gone ... but save me some!</li>
    <li> It did a good job of lengthening the life of my curls. Actually I shouldn&#x27;t say curls because they quickly fall into waves. My hair is VERY hard to curl so I love anything that can at least somewhat make my curls last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and have found it to be better than many of the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; lines of curl activating products.  I have dark brown (almost black) hair so certain products tend to flake and/or turn my hair dusty white.  This is not one of those products!  It activates curl without leaving any chalky residue and works great!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in any of the stores including Wal-Mart and had to go to their direct web-site to get it. If you don&#x27;t totally wash your hair everyday,(I wash every other day and just wet during my shower) it is great to bring your hair with waves back to life after using just a few sprays. My first day I wash and condition my hair and then style. My second day I use this product and restyle. I do use mousse on my first day however. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I am not using right or what but it&#x27;s definitely not working for me.</li>
    <li> My personal favorite for every day use.</li>
    <li> I tried it today and I&#x27;m not sure I am a fan. It makes it hard to blow dry hair and makes it almost feel drier and dirty. I don;t know, maybe just not right product for me.</li>
</ol>
