<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great, effective sunscreen. It feels nice on my face; not greasy or sticky. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this sunscreen on Saturday before we left for a swimming party so it worked out perfectly. Easy to open and apply. It is not greasy and still thin, not thick. Goes on very easily and doesn&#x27;t have an added scent, just a normal sunscreen smell. I did not feel sticky and it did not irritate my skin one bit.  I reapplied after 2 hours in the pool and did not sunburn at all. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is a great non greasy sunscreen and fragrance free. I wore it all day in the sun and no burn.</li>
    <li> Really love this sunscreen. I went on a very thorough search for a sunscreen that was hydrating, for sensitive skin, had broad spectrum, no parabens, non-comedogenic, not greasy, and papa-free. It is light without the gritty feeling of so many sunscreens out there. Plus, it is very gentle. I have sensitive skin and I had no reaction. Among all of the bonuses, you only have to use a sparse amount because it is so hydrating and it spreads well. This also means you get more for your money as it lasts longer. It was delivered very quickly and the company was very professional in making sure I was satisfied with the product. Excellent product and value.</li>
    <li> This will be a rather odd review, as I don&#x27;t use sunscreen at the beach as most do; I use it in the desert. My old go-to sunscreen is NO-AD 30, but I wanted to try something that went on better. Both are similar in SPF, and in how they are applied (creams containing acylates which polymerize on the skin to provide some degree of water-fastness). Immediately after application: NO-AD is greasy for about three minuted before the product polymerizes. Andre Lorent rubs right in with very little greasy feel. Winner: Andre Lorent++. 10-minutes after application: Both have polymerized. NO-AD leaves a detectible layer on the skin, Andre Lorent leaves my skin felling and looking normal. Winner: Andre Lorent+. Smell: NO-AD has a mild sunscreen smell which lingers on and on. Andre Lorent has a very slight odor which fades after 10 minutes to nothing. Winner: Andre Lorent++. Long-term use: NO-AD has shorter longevity due, I think, to the thickness of the application making it easer to rub off. Andre Lorent applies thinner and lasts longer because it remains on the skin, perhaps moving with the skin better? Winner: Andre Lorent+. Protection from UV: Both seems the same to me. I applied one to my left side, and one to my right on two different days, spend a lot of time out riding in the July sun (at 8000 foot elevation where the sun is particularly harsh) and observed no burning from either product. Winner: tie. Cost: NO-AD is $10 for 16 ounces, Andre Lorent is $25 for 3.4 ounces. Winner: NO-AD++. Tally fo far: NO-AD&#x3D;+2, Andre Lorent&#x3D;+6. Andre Lorent has every advantage except cost. Will Andre Lorent be my new go-to sunscreen? It is a five-star product, after all. Probably not, because of the price. But it is the one I now carry in the truck.</li>
    <li> Not too greasy. Not too strong of a smell. Works like sunscreen :)</li>
    <li> Since I live in Hawaii, I&#x27;m always out in the sun. I love that I can leave this in my bag and apply it before I head out.</li>
    <li> I received the sunscreen day before yesterday, since we are in the middle of summer when the package arrived the lotion was almost liquified by being in the heat, but I put it in the refrigerator to cool it down and now here is the best part.  By the time it cooled down it was too late to actually try it as a sunscreen but I was anxious to see how it felt and just as important on how the scent would be on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So I took the lotion from the refrigerator and it had sat out at room temperature while I was on the phone, no more than 5 minutes so the lotion was still cool when I applied it and let me tell you it was like spreading a bit of heaven on my face and arms.... the lotion itself was like silk going on my skin, it was not greasy and did not leave that greasy shine that some sunscreens will leave on your skin and the scent was barely, barely noticeable if at all and this could be my imagination, but after the lotion was absorbed into my skin, which didn&#x27;t take long at all,  and I smelled my arm, it reminded me of when we lived about a block from the ocean in California, with just a very slight scent of the fresh smell of the ocean mixed with the early morning fog that would come in most mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I absolutely love his stuff not only as a sunscreen but as for a daily lotion for my face as well to keep it hydrated, when it was cool on my skin it was so refreshing especially in this summer heat we are having here in Texas, but room temperature the lotion preformed just as good.  This morning I applied it before going out into the sun to do a little bit of work before the heat makes it to unbearable to be out  in it and I applied the lotion and it never once felt heavy or sticky on my skin like the other lotions have done before, and most of all it didn&#x27;t have the strong smell.  Out in the sun it performed better than any sunscreen I have ever used before.  Thank you for making such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Yes, this sunscreen provides Sun protection but why won&#x27;t I ever be without it in the future?  It goes on easily, my skin soaked it up like a sponge !  No greasy residue, it felt smooth and velvety and a little goes a long way.  Perfect for an outdoor wedding I will be attending - Sun protection without looking like I&#x27;m oiled up for a body building contest!</li>
    <li> Love! The texture was perfect. Not runny or thick. I can wear it all day without fuss. No bothersome oder either which is a plus. Liked that it&#x27;s animal cruelty free. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a daily sunscreen. Although I wouldve liked it to be a little higher spf. This is 30 and I prefer 50+. Also it had a little more ingredients than I try to use on my skin.  I like  to stick to only a few ingredients and more natural ingredients. I will use this product daily :)</li>
    <li> I loved it! It is lightweight  and easily  absorbed.  Some sunscreens  are smothering  and make me hot.....this didn&#x27;t. It has a fresh clean scent</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for when you need sunscreen but don&#x27;t want to feel like you are wearing a sunscreen.  I use this on my face because it is light and does not feel heavy on my face.  I also enjoy that it is scent free.  It protects well and leaves my skin feeling fresh not sticky or like I have a heavy film on me.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen. A pleasant but not overpowering smell. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel like it has anything on it. It&#x27;s not oily at all. And it works well even if you are in water for a bit. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that it is a lotion instead of a spray. I find it easier to use a spray and it goes on more evenly. But overall this is a great product for myself and my whole family (husband and children ages 11 and 7).</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer sunscreen, let me tell you a little about me, I have a skin condition called vitiligo is a discoloration of the skin, and I have to be very careful with the sun, So I try every sunscreen moisturizer out there, this hydrate my skin and it works really great with makeup, is not sticky and best of all doesn&#x27;t have that sunscreen smell and leave my skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;And one of the most important thing for me that&#x27;s cruelty free. So yes I love it. Thanks.:-)</li>
    <li> I was looking for an everyday sunscreen for my face and arms that didn&#x27;t have parabens.  This is nice and light, rubs in well, and isn&#x27;t too heavy under make up.  It smells like sunscreen when you first rub it in but then quickly goes away.</li>
    <li> Used this sunscreen all weekend at the lake.  One of the hottest weekends of the summer so far.  Worked well and was non-greasy.  Only applied it once all day.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating, good coverage and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I received the sunscreen product free to try and review. I liked the sunscreen because it did not have a strong smell and worked well. It went on easy not greasy to the touch either. I like the higher SPF since I am fair completed. I have tried other sunscreen products that were very greasy to the touch. After only a few days with the product I intend to keep using it since it also seems to soften my skin as well.</li>
    <li> I normally do not like sunscreens because they are greasy and leave me feeling hot and sweaty.  Andre Lorent&#x27;s Daily Hydrating Sunscreen is a creme of a different caliber.  Even when I first put on the creme, it was super moist and stood on my skin for a short time as it worked to absorb into the skin layers.  An hour later, and after being out in the heat, my skin was still soft and moist.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the product.  I have a fair, clear complexion and did not pink up during my time in the sun.&lt;br /&gt; I did not conduct extensive tests, but was pleased with my casual use. A test supply of this product was made available at a nominal rate to allow me to sample and provide a fair review of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product a 4.5 out of 5 Star review for my casual use (non-sport) of the product.  The tube does indicate reapplication every two hours or after swimming or excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a daily sunscreen face lotion that would replace what I was using before (Mary Kay Daily Solution SPF 35). I really like the light and airy feel of this and it seems to be working as far as protecting my face from harmful UV Rays. The reason I did not give five stars was because the smell is very similar to a regular sunblock that you wou,d use on your skin and I just wish it was a little milder. However, that&#x27;s me being picky. Also, Andre Lorent contacted me via email personally to see if I liked the product and I appreciate the personal touch! Great product!</li>
    <li> Andre Larent Ultra Sport sunscreen Is awesome! It is smooth &amp; blends into my skin well. I have allergies to a lot of skin products but had none with Andre Larent Ultra Sport sunscreen. I love it&#x27;s scent, clean &amp; fresh smelling. I love that it stays on in the water &amp; with sweat. It does not sting my eyes like other sunscreens do. I have trouble with my nose burning when in the sun, but not with Andre Larent Ultra Sport sunscreen. I love that it is a great moisturizer, my skin feels great after using it. I will be sharing my find with my friends!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this sunscreen, it feels great on my skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or make me perspire while wearing it, which is important since I make sure I apply it before leaving the house. I am fair skinned so this SPC 30 works perfect for me. After years of sun exposure, I have seen the damage the sun can do to unprotected skin. Biopsies and having your skin frozen is not fun, best to make sure sunscreen is part of your normal routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen (to me at least) does seem to have a slight fragrance, what I can smell is not unpleasant and is very faint. I apply this to exposed skin 30 minutes before leaving the house. This sunscreen is light enough to wear under makeup. I have even mixed a drop of my makeup into a few drops of sunscreen as a tint and then applied to my face. The  A,B,C, and E vitamins, as well as the seaweed extract, does seem to lock in moisture and help my skin look nice and stay hydrated. Just make sure you reapply after a couple of hours, or if you swim or perspire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I apply to my skin I can feel the difference, my skin feels really soft. It doesn&#x27;t feels heavy or smell like coconuts and the beach, which makes it nice for daily use. For the past couple of days we&#x27;ve had 100+ degree weather here in Southern Calif., and this sunscreen has helped me keep from burning. I burn very easily, normally I would have started to pink up in about 10 minutes in this heat. I was running in and out of the house most of the day and got some color, but did not burn! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free product sample received for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Updated 9/25/15 - We decided we were going to spend our anniversary on a whale watching cruise. It&#x27;s been so hot here over the past few weeks and it was so much cooler on the coast.  Mr. Doom &amp; Gloom (my husband),  looks at me as we&#x27;re waiting to board the boat and says, &amp;#34; Ooooo you didn&#x27;t bring a hat,...and you&#x27;re wearing short sleeves too,...you&#x27;re going to get so burnt! You&#x27;ll be sorry tonight.&amp;#34; :/&lt;br /&gt; I had applied this sunscreen to all exposed skin 30 minutes before we left the house and tossed the bottle in my purse in case I needed to reapply later. I never did have to reapply, and after spending 3 hours on a boat and 30+ minutes waiting in line without shade I can honestly say this is the BEST sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!!  I was a tiny bit pink later that evening but not burnt at all. I am very, very fair skinned so after being out in the hot sun for almost 4 hours I was very happy with the performance of this sunscreen!had applied this sunscreen to all exposed skin 30 minutes before we left the house and tossed the bottle in my purse in case I needed to reapply later. I never did have to reapply, and after spending 3 hours on a boat and 30+ minutes waiting in line without shade I can honestly say this is the BEST sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!!  I was a tiny bit pink later that evening but not burnt at all. I am very, very fair skinned so after being out in the hot sun for almost 4 hours I was very happy with the performance of this sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Smells great! This sunscreen was easy to apply, not greasy and had a nice smell to it as well. I wanted to tan out by the pool but not burn and this was the perfect fit. My kids even liked it (they hate applying sunscreen because it always feels so caked-on, but not this!)</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly. Dries quickly. No odor.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smear my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I love it!  The consistency is just right; not too thick or runny.  Absorbs quickly and gives my skin a healthy glow.  This sunscreen has become a part of my morning routine and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Feels really good and my skin has improved now that I&#x27;ve changed my daily sunscreen to this. Love it.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used. Makes skin smooth and soft and great protection from sun at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used! It leaves my skin feeling so soft and it feels perfectly hydrated. I don&#x27;t think I can ever use anything else again.</li>
    <li> I received this sunscreen on Saturday and was excited to try it.  I spend every weekend with my family on the lake and am very particular on my sunscreen, as we are all fair skinned and my husband cannot stand the greasy feeling many leave behind.  This lotion was excellent; the smell was light, it did not leave a greasy or tacky feeling, and no one was burned this weekend!  The other great thing is about this sunscreen is that it was not rough on our skin; my son and I have very sensitive skin and did not break out with eczema like most lotions do to us.  I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  My teenage son was started on a prescription acne medication a month ago and no matter what we used on his face for sunscreen he still seemed to slightly burn.  Last weekend I had him use this and he did not have any tint of pink at all after 5 days on the lake.  Also, his skin did not break out due to the chemicals found in most sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Living in Florida there is nothing more important than a Quality Sunscreen and this Daily Dehydrating Sunscreen by Andre Lorent fits the bill above and beyond my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so I expect this 3.4 fl oz tube to last a considerable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;The  ingredients in Andre Lorent&#x27;s unique proprietary formula called Sundrisol7(TM) which include Vitamins A, B, C &amp; E &amp; Seaweed Extract make my skin feel and appear much softer than other suntan lotions I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that Andre Lorent offers a silver foil safety tab which must be removed to dispense the lotion, because it assures me that the product inside the tube is fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the tube has a nicely sized, flip style Flat cap so I can stand it on end in my medicine chest when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I live in Florida, I am agoraphobic and do not spend a lot of time in the sun, however, I want to know that I am well protected from UVB rays when I do get the courage to venture out to the pool or the beach and the 30+ SPF factor is just what I need.&lt;br /&gt;As I recently turned another year older and am now in my early 60&#x27;s, the fact that it also protects from skin aging UVA rays while moisturizing my skin is a Huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;What I Love Most about this Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen is the way this rich creamy lotion Absorbs into my skin Quickly and without leaving a &amp;#34;whiter than I already am&amp;#34; appearance.&lt;br /&gt;It is virtually Fragrance Free so I can wear my favorite fragrance without conflict.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen at a reduced cost in exchange for testing and review and I can honestly say that I would be willing to forgo my weekly bingo night if necessary just so I can afford to purchase a replacement when the tube I have is empty!&lt;br /&gt;Believe me when I say that my bingo nights are very important to me as they are one of the few social activities I feel comfortable attending and they are not a sacrifice I would even consider making unless I truly felt it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;In this case it most definitely would be and I am giving this Andre Lorent Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen my highest recommendation!consider making unless I truly felt it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;In this case it most definitely would be and I am giving this Andre Lorent Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen my highest recommendation!</li>
    <li> I received my ANDRE LORENT Daily Rehydration Sunscreen from Amazon as promised on the website.  I  did receive a discount on this product so that I  could review this product.  From HOT ARIZONA, I DO wear sunscreen.  My first experience with this sunscreen is POSITIVE.  The lotion has quite a few things I liked!  First, it is fragrance free!  Secondly,  I really liked the consistency of the lotion.  You do not need to use tons and the coverage is excellent. The lotion is very moisturizing and will hydrate your skin.  I did not have the &amp;#34;greaseball&amp;#34; feeling and it does not contain any type of shimmer,  which is nice considering my middle age (I&#x27;m not going to a disco!).  Lastly,  I put the lotion on prior to going for a walk and errands.  It definitely lasted and did not perspire off my body and I still looked moisturized. Thumbs up Andre Lorent!</li>
    <li> I am vacationing in Florida and have really put this product to the test.  It has performed wonderfully, it&#x27;s  not greasy on your skin, it&#x27;s very moisturizing and most of all, it&#x27;s  a fantastic sunscreen!! My husband is even using it!! Keep up the good work with your products and be proud they are cruelty free as well!</li>
    <li> Not greasy feeling at all and has a nice light scent, not overpowering at all, or overly fragranced.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to fully test it for an extended period in the sun, but I like the intial feel of it, and look forward to using it soon!</li>
    <li> I received this sunscreen and have been using it for the last 3 days.  The sunscreen is not scented so it doesn&#x27;t smell like typical sunscreens.  The sunscreen is not greasy, non oily and goes on smoothly.  I use it as a moisturizing lotion as my skin tends to be somewhat dry.  It has been in the low 90&#x27;s the last few days and I have been out in the sun for a good portion of the day and with the Andre Lorent sunscreen I did not burn.  I did reapply the sunscreen after about 3-4 hours being out in the sun.  So far the Andre Lorent sunscreen has done a super job in keeping my skin moisturized and free from sunburn.  Thanks to a great product.</li>
    <li> I HATE sunscreen. I hate the way it leaves an oily residues my skin. I hate the way it smells. I hate how thick and hard it is to rub into the skin. If you all hate the same way sunscreen makes you feel, In have found the solution! This product is wonderful! It&#x27;s easy to apply. It smells good. It moisturizes wonderfully. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  Honestly. It is wonderful! My skin looks amazing! (Especially my legs!) I HIGHLY recommend this product. Especially for those of us who hate sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this, it didn&#x27;t smell bad!!  It arrived just in time for a weekend fishing jaunt.  The sun can get fierce out on a boat in the water.  I used this before we went out and didn&#x27;t use it again until several hours later when we went back to shore.  I did get a sunburn in one little spot that I apparently missed while putting on the cream.  I guess just proved to methat this sunscreen is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is not greasy and heavy.  It is a light and creamy and actually felt like I was putting on a hydrating lotion instead of sunscreen.  It worked great for me, I love the feel of it and the non-smell of it.  I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention......it was mild enough for my face.</li>
    <li> Just received this product and I love it! Not the over powering sunscreen smell like most - has a nice soft scent.  It sinks into your skin when you apply  it and you can feel it - it doesn&#x27;t feel like its gone.  Very nice product!</li>
    <li> Amazing feel on your skin. Comes out clearish (leaves no white cast), yet at the same time is NOT greasy and blends into your skin really nicely. I am able to use it under my makeup no problem. Bonus: it smells great too.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has the recommended SPF 30+ rating.  However, it does not have that strong unpleasant odor that most sunscreens have, but a much more neutral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a white lotion that is not overly thick, so it is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  It has ingredients to moisturize and protect the skin from loss of moisture as well as from solar radiation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is for daily use and is not waterproof.  Andr&amp;eacute; Lorent also has a  [[ASIN:B010W5ENO6 sports sunscreen lotion]] for active use or at the beach or pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3.4 oz. or 100 ml tube is the perfect size as it is the maximum amount allowed in carry-on luggage when flying and it also easily fits in a handbag or tote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andr&amp;eacute; Lorent provided sunscreen for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Lightweight non-greasy &amp; good sun protection.  Leaves my skin feeling hydrated not a heavy feel. The lightly fragrance that is pleasant not overpowering</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I do not usually wear sunscreen unless I am going to be out for a long time during the day. I don&#x27;t normally like the way sunscreen feels on my skin. It is like my skin can&#x27;t breathe and I feel hotter with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, when this product arrived and was applied, it was so light and creamy. It didn&#x27;t have the same heavy feel. The scent is typical for a sunscreen but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this as my moisturizer in the morning under my foundation. It is smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause me to sweat. This is a big deal for me. I have also applied it to my forearms which is just about the only other part of me that sees the sun unless I am in the pool with the little ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen leaves my arms and face feeling soft. Even without the benefit of sun protection, this is a great lotion/moisturizer. SPF 30 is just enough protection for the average amount of time I spend outside and I would recommend this product to others that do not like the feel of normal sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to be able to have the protection and the comfort in one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> Nice consistency and fragrance, but I have concerns about the sun protection quality of this product.</li>
    <li> i received this item yesterday in the mail via the Amazon Deals. I used it as soon as it came in on my little cousin, who is 10. He loved the smell of it. He also was happy that he didn&#x27;t get a sunburn. It lasted for a long time, of sitting around, sweating and swimming.</li>
    <li> I just received it and it is very creamy and moisturizing with a very pleasant fragrance. Fragrance is very light and clean smelling, not overwhelming at all. It is easy to apply, not greasy or heavy and feels very smooth to the touch. Definitely something I would order again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on skin and it soaks in well. It does the job.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This product is about as exciting as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. That is, if you like PBJ! The sunscreen goes on smooth and silky and leaves no greasy feel -- unlike other products I have used in the past. This is a perfect sunscreen to use under makeup. It is very light. The true test will be my upcoming trip to the beach - stand by.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I tried Andre Lorent rehydrating sunscreen today and love it! It&#x27;s fragrance free and goes on really nicely...not greasy at all! It actually made my skin feel really soft after applying. I also love that they do not test on animals. Great product!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way for this sunscreen.  I hate how thick and pasty some sunscreens feel on your face. Too many times, I fell like I am putting on diaper cream and not sunscreen.  This sunscreen feels like a high end skin cream more than a sunscreen.  It is light and blends quickly.  I typically use for my face, but because of the quick blend, I have found that it is so easy to use all over.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave the plastic film feeling that spray sunscreens leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is unscented.  So many sunscreens have a chemical smell.  This is a high end skin care line that is not only effective, but has no Paragons and is not tested on animals.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Very lightweight, nongreasy.  I have extremely sensitive skin and am very picky about what I put on it, but this caused no burning or redness to my face.  I applied it first thing in the morning, did not reapply, and still did not get burned.</li>
    <li> I live in South Florida and am outside all the time!  Sunscreen is a necessity.  I am also very into fitness and run most days.  I received this item very quickly and immediately gave it a try.  I have very sensitive skin and tend to break out with many lotions.  I have been using this for 4 days now and my skin feels great.  It goes on nicely, rubs in great and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I&#x27;ve run 3 days with it and am very happy!</li>
    <li> Received this product through Amazon Deals Club today and used it immediately.  This sunscreen is truly unique in that it is soft and light and is not greasy or &amp;#34;zinc oxide-like&amp;#34;.  Absorbs quickly.  There is an initial scent (not unpleasant)  which disappears almost immediately once you rub it in.  Seems to do a fine job in sunscreen department, and my skin does, indeed feel nicely moisturized.  Admittedly, this costs considerably more than I would normally pay for sunscreen that I tend to slather on when I play golf several times a week.  BUT... This would be excellent for daily use when you don&#x27;t want to look like you&#x27;re wearing sunscreen, and the moisturizing effect is a huge plus!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was expecting Andre Lorent sunscreen to be very similar to the rest of the sunscreen out there. My son has very sensitive skin and has struggled with this condition for many years. Andre Lorent sunscreen is not only better than any other sunscreen I have ever used on him but he loves the fact it doesn&#x27;t smell like every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used in the past. I thought with bottle being only 3.4oz that it would be gone after a couple of uses, however; the consistency of the lotion allows a little to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself have very oily skin and never liked putting sunscreen on my face for this reason. Andre Lorent sunscreen is a very oil free lotion that will not leave your face looking shinny nor feel as though your pores are clogged as soon as you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a very happy customer that will not use any other sunscreen unless Andre Lorent comes out with a new one.</li>
    <li> The first day I had the sunscreen we had rain!  Normally, I&#x27;ve been helping my husband mowing lawns in the neighborhood, mowing approximately three hours a day during the hottest part of the day.  Using your sunscreen has been very nice, it&#x27;s not greasy, grass clippings don&#x27;t even stick!  My skin doesn&#x27;t appear to be as dry either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to try your sunscreen and let you know what I thought about it.</li>
    <li> I I haven&#x27;t received it it wouldn&#x27;t even let me order it but I have tried it before and it was great I tried to do it again but it wouldn&#x27;t let my promo code go through but it is really good stuff</li>
    <li> I love the way this sunscreen feels on my skin. It&#x27;s creamy, not greasy and absorbs quickly. I wore it today in the sun and heat of the day, and didn&#x27;t sweat it off. It protected me from getting red or burned. That&#x27;s everything you want a sunscreen to do. I received a coupon for this review, but it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Where has this sunscreen been all my life? I waited to share my review until I had a chance to actually use this product, so many sunscreens are oily or only work for an hour or so, no this product!! It is amazing, my skin actually felt better after being in the sun all day with this hydrating sunscreen!!! I will never be without it, I am in the process of reordering to ensure I never run out!!! The texture is wonderful and works right into the skin, and then it continues working long after other Similiar products poop out!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is amazing! It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky. I could barely notice it was on.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Living in Florida sunscreen is an everyday essential.  This Andre Lorent Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen SPF30+ is perfect for everyday use. It goes on smooth, non-greasy, and fragrance free so you don&#x27;t walk around smelling like you&#x27;re at the beach all day.  I can even wear it under my makeup without breaking out! This is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; sunscreen. I will definitely buy it again and recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Perfect! This sunscreen has exceeded my expectations. Finally, a sunscreen that is truly non-greasy,fragrance free and for sensitive skin. I&#x27;m really impressed how well it absorbed into my skin, including my face, without leaving any sticky residue. I love the fact that this company does not use  animal testing.  The tube is the perfect size to throw in your bag too. Give it a try; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product.  I like the way my skin feels already, it feels  moist and not dry and flakey.  I&#x27;ll write another review in about a week, I&#x27;m going to be outside a lot this weekend.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying. I deliver mail; I&#x27;m outside all day, everyday in all kinds of weather. I received my Andre&#x27; Lorent Rehydrating Sunscreen in the evening when I got home. I was a little bit curious and rubbed some on the top of my left hand. The initial scent was faint and barely noticeable, like that of high end cosmetics. The sunscreen went on very easily, not gloppy or greasy like most sunscreens. It was very light and absorbed easily into my skin. The next morning I woke up and was shocked at how silky and smooth the top of my left hand felt, all from the Andre&#x27; Lorent. I used the lotion this morning all over my face, neck and arms. The lotion did not burn or sting when I went over my eyelids, another good sign. By mid afternoon I noticed how silky smooth my arms and face felt, it really was remarkable. There is no slimy, greasy, oily residue; just a dry, silky smooth feeling. It comes out of the tube in a thin milky white lotion, be careful a little goes a long way. I definitely would recommend this sunscreen not only for protection from the sun but for it&#x27;s moisturizing and hydrating benefit also. My face, hands and arms felt so much better.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful on your skin!!  All the other sunscreens I have tried feel like they clog your pores and make you hotter and sweat more. This does not have that feeling. I live in Florida where it is hot and very humid on the gulf coast 8 months of the year and if you are out in the sun you must use a sunscreen  and I wil forever now use only Andre Lorent Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen as part of my daily routine!!!</li>
    <li> I recently was able to try this product over the weekend. I love the fact that it has anti-aging properties. This product went on more like a moisturizer and not a thick sunscreen. It absorbed very quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy type feeling. I have very sensitive skin, and tried this on my face and it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all. It actually just felt like my daily moisturizer I wear. This product not only protects you against UVA and UVB rays, but it&#x27;s also good for your skin! I also love the fact that this can be used for 6 months and up, so even my 4 year old daughter can use it when we are out. I did receive this item for free however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> As a three time melanoma survivor,  I was happy to receive this sunscreen as a product review.  I also have four tween age daughters (ages 9, 10, 11 and 13) who are very active and we go through a great deal of sunscreen in our house.  I have taken my time to really put this sunscreen to the test and I love it and highly recommend it!  This is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Is it effective? YES! I put this lotion to the test in various situations.  At the pool, beach, gardening, boating, zoo trip, etc.  It was effective in every situation, even if not reapplied after a few hours.  (I always reapply but getting Tweens to do so is not easy.)&lt;br /&gt;Is it easy to apply? Absolutely!  I tend to use spray sunscreen because of how quick and easy they are to use with a busy schedule and multiple children.  Many lotions tend to be thick and hard to apply.  NOT this sunscreen.  It has a great consistency, not too thick or thin and rubs in with ease!  My busy kids were even able to apply it without help! And a bonus is that it has a nice, very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;Is it good for sensitive skin? YES!  This was a major pro for us.  Two of my daughters have extremely sensitive skin and easily have rashes/breakouts from other sunscreens. Both girls had no problems at all with this lotion.  In fact, it is now their lotion of choice and the only one they want to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-The only con I have is the price.  This is priced higher than the sunscreen we tend to buy at the drugstore.  I was skeptical that I would actually rebuy after my review bottle was gone.  However, I discovered that this tube lasts MUCH longer than our normal sunscreen.  I was surprised at the number of applications we got out of one tube.  I will definitely be buying more in our future.  It has become over favorite sunscreen!</li>
    <li> love it goes on light and feels great</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt one of the best brands of sunscreen/sunblock I&#x27;ve used. When the company offered a bottle for review, I was glad to accommodate. However, upon using it for some time now, I&#x27;m beyond glad and rave about it to all my friends and family. It&#x27;s truly difficult to come across a sunscreen that not only protects your skin but makes it look great at the same time. I get lots of compliments from my BF about how moist/dewy my skin looks when I apply this product. Additionally, it makes my skin SUPER soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-SPF 30+ and leaves no ashy/white finish (My friends with deeper complexions have tried it and it blends in very well)&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizes skin equal or better than some lotions&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t have an strong scent or odd odor  (smells quite nice actually)&lt;br /&gt;-The consistency is something quite usual for sunscreens/sunblocks. (Almost like a milk/milky lotion type of texture)&lt;br /&gt;-Makes skin look quite smooth and dewy despite drying completely&lt;br /&gt;-Non greasy</li>
    <li> I recently received this great sunscreen at a greatly reduced cost for submitting my opinion of product. My family and I have used several different brands and various coverage over the years. This is by far one of the best products we have used!  Not only is the protection high, it goes on smoothly and the smell is very pleasant also. I will buy again and recommend to anyone wanting a very good product.</li>
    <li> I live in an area where we need sunscreen constantly.  I also have Lupus, which is an auto-immune disease where I&#x27;m almost allergic to the sun.  Since I have so many kids that are active and I Live in Hawaii, the sun can&#x27;t be avoided.  I have used many sunscreens that have either not worked at all. left my skin feeling awful, caused breakouts or was so expensive I couldn&#x27;t even afford it.  When I got the chance to use Andre Lorent&#x27;s Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen I was cautiously optimistic since I loved their other products I&#x27;ve used.  I totally loved this rehydrating sunscreen it goes on so smoothly and is not thick at all.  You feel it there for about 5 minutes and then it absorbs very well.  I was able to stay out at my children&#x27;s soccer games for the entire afternoon with no sunburn, I reapplied once and it was great.  I love how silky my skin feels.  I feel moisturized but not sticky or greasy.  It&#x27;s been very humid but this sunscreen did very well with the humidity.  Andre Lorent&#x27;s Sunscreen will be my go to sunscreen not with out a doubt.  I have complete confidence in and love it.  This is really the BEST sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  I received this product at no charge for my truthful opinions.  Please know that I will only share my true experiences.</li>
    <li> I was outside for two LONG days this weekend working in the garden and never got a sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great sunscreen. Creamy and moisturizing, but not sticky or greasy. I especially like it for the delicate skin of the face -- especially for sensitive skin. Plus, it&#x27;s not tested on animals, which I LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some unusual ingredients like seaweed and algae. Plus, it contains orchid extract, which I researched because I had never heard of it being used in beauty products before. One study I located (H&amp;PC, 2012) found that &amp;#34;orchid oil may help to boost UVB protection significantly when used in conjunction with a sunscreen.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is fantastic.  My wife has Lupus and sunlight is really an enemy for her.  This product allowed her to be in the sun with no problems after the fact.  I would give it more stars if it was possible</li>
    <li> Really nice product. Seems pricey at first, until you realize that it&#x27;s twice the size of most of the ones you buy at Sephora (for purposes of comparison, I typically get the Murad sunscreen, and it&#x27;s 1.7 oz for around $35). Very light and pleasant scent; not overpoweringly chemical or coconut-y in any way. Blends very easily and feels light - more like a high-end moisturizer than a heavy sunblock. The active sunscreen ingredients are pretty standard, which is fine because those are the ones that work! But it&#x27;s obvious they went out of their way to make the inactive ingredients high-quality, so the whole overall feel of the product is really nice. The reason for four stars instead of five is that my forehead did show some shine after an hour or two, but that&#x27;s standard practice for sunscreens (I tend to be shiny in the t-zone, so the only ones who don&#x27;t do that to me are the ones specifically marketed as &#x27;matte&#x27; or &#x27;shine-free&#x27;). I received an early sample of this product at a reduced price, but the opinions expressed here are entirely my own.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Feels soft to the touch and non greasy! Perfect for my weekend in San Diego!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great!  It is light weight and feels great on my skin. It is very moisturizing, and leaves my skin feeling soft. Best of all, I love that it is free of harmful ingredients!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! Feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it is described. It is not greasy and easy to apply. It is fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. I love the fact that it can be used for baby who is over 6 months old. Given it is also reasonably priced. I think I will buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I just received my lotion but so far it&#x27;s great! It is unscented- just has light sunscreen smell which is great, it is non-greasy and goes on smooth! It is Paraben free and not tested on animals- both of which are huge pluses! I would definitely recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:557f68c0a3e744e25c8ecb2a37c16458]]Andr&amp;eacute; Lorent Sunscreen is just what I was looking for in a suncreen, something that offered up strong protection from the sun, but didn&#x27;t have toxic ingredients.  Mind you, I&#x27;m not up on the chemical properties of various things, but I do know that Coppertone is out and paraben-free is in.  My generation is now having to deal with skin cancers of all types from overexposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son has very sensitive skin and his generation has been well-informed about the result of excessive UV rays.  Yesterday was a heavy work day for him, out in the glaring sun all day long.  He asked if I had any suncreen and this was exactly what he wanted.  I think he thought I&#x27;d show up with some two dollar sunscreen with an SPF of 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andr&amp;eacute; Lorent Sunscreen is perfect for him because he has very sensitive skin and many lotions simply don&#x27;t agree with him.  If he was going to be out in the sun all day, he not only needed protection from the UV rays, but also something that was a moisturizer.  He slathered it on from head to toe because he was only going to have time for one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fragrance-free, but does have some natural fragrance to it that I can smell.  It didn&#x27;t bother either on of us at all, but if you&#x27;re ultra-sensitive to fragrances, take a pass.  The day was long, the sun high in the sky, but at the end of the day all was well.  He didn&#x27;t have a single patch of burn and was quite satisfied with the performance.  I&#x27;m not sure how this would perform at the beach, but he certainly perspired heavily and still got the protection I wanted to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Extr&amp;eacute;me Protection&lt;br /&gt;►  SPF 30+ UVA / UVB Broad Spectrum&lt;br /&gt;►  Non-Greasy&lt;br /&gt;►  Moisturizing  and Rehydrating&lt;br /&gt;►  Hypoallergenic&lt;br /&gt;►  Paba-Free&lt;br /&gt;►  Non-Comedogenic&lt;br /&gt;►  No Parabens&lt;br /&gt;►  No Animal Testing&lt;br /&gt;►  Fragrance-Free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (Sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octinoxate:  7.5%&lt;br /&gt;Homosalate:  6%&lt;br /&gt;Octisalate:  5%&lt;br /&gt;Avobenzone:  3%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), C12-15 Akyl Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Akyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Hydrolyzed Manihot Esculenta Tuber Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyporoyl Methylcelloulose, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Myrtus Communis Leaf Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Extract, Lindera Strychnifolia Root Extract, Orchis Morio (Orchid) Flower Extract, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.ive Ingredients:    Water (Aqua), C12-15 Akyl Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Akyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Hydrolyzed Manihot Esculenta Tuber Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyporoyl Methylcelloulose, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Myrtus Communis Leaf Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Extract, Lindera Strychnifolia Root Extract, Orchis Morio (Orchid) Flower Extract, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid    Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> This is a nice sunscreen. I received it as a discount price. It applies very easily and rubs in fast. It has a no harsh smell and protects nicely from the sun.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a good sunscreen.  I am very diligent about skin protection and when it comes to sunscreen I want great sun protection, easy application, and it has to be compatible with my very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen by Andre Lorent.  The first reason would be that this sunscreen is hypoallergenic and great for sensitive skin.  I had no reaction to the product and it is also wonderful in that it goes on so smooth and not greasy like other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they say it is moisturizing and rehydrating, they aren&#x27;t kidding.  I have very dry skin and it felt very supple and hydrated for a couple of hours.  You do have to reapply to get the proper sun protection and that lends to the rehydrating of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the sun protection was good.  I could not tell a huge difference between this product and others I&#x27;ve used in the sense of protection but that is not a negative.  I only choose and wear those sunscreens that I feel will give me the greatest protection.  This product ranks right up there with the sunscreens I have used for ultimate protection and coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product five stars but there was one slight drawback for me.  It says that is is &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; and I know that having that labeling does not guarantee no smell at all.  It did have a slight smell and while it was not the sunscreen smell that others have or tropical coconut or whatever, I didn&#x27;t care for it.  The scent was not a deal breaker though, and I would use this product again.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great daily sunscreen that can be used by everyone look no further.  My wife and I enjoyed the light feel of this lotion and I appreciated the fragrance free smell.  It goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy or feeling heavy.  Provides good protection from the sun while rehydrating your skin.</li>
    <li> Very soft skin and sun protection too. Fantastic !</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today, it leaves my skin very soft, which I love. Does say it is fragrance free, but has a slight sun tan lotion fragrance which doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  Would I buy again?  Yes, if there was a good deal on it.</li>
    <li> I received this as a special offer in the &amp;#34;deals&amp;#34; club. I was worried about &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients but after receiving and reading the actual label (which I was not able to do from the site) I was pleasantly surprised! No paraben...YEA!!! It doesn&#x27;t have an odor either, another big plus! It goes on smooth, non greasy and does a great job. I used it while working in the yard Sunday in the Texas SUN and didn&#x27;t get burned.</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona so sunscreen is a must everyday! I enjoyed using this sunscreen, both on myself and my children. It absorbs quickly and has a nice non tacky finish. While it does smell like sunscreen, the formula is better than most I have ever tried (and I have tried dozens). What appeals to me is the UVA and UVB protection, you don&#x27;t get both forms in many products. Convenient size for fitting in your purse or bag, I recommend this sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I tried this out and I liked it. I only gave it 4 stars because I like my sunscreen to have a scent and this one really didn&#x27;t have one.  On another note it gave good protection and my skin felt very soft.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is just as advertised.  It only took a tiny bit to cover my entire face and backs of my hands (see pic), so I anticipate it will last a long time.  I have VERY fair skin and am sensitive to many facial products.  This sunscreen states it is fragrance free (it is!) so it does not trigger any issues for those sensitive to scent.  It states it is for sensitive skin and it is because I had no adverse reaction to this product.  In fact, it is truly just as advertised.  I put it on this morning just after washing my face.  I skipped my usual moisturizer as product promo states it both hydrates skin and has an anti-aging formula built in.  My face felt great.  It is so nice to have an SPF30 sunscreen that doubles as a skin care product.  If it were just a sunscreen, it would seem quite pricey.  But when it provides both skin care and sunscreen in one, it becomes quite a bargain.  The skin care product I&#x27;ve been using costs far more than this for less than 1/2 as much product.  Added bonus--it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky like so many sunscreens.  This product is a win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional comment--This company is dedicated to customer satisfaction.  They ship quickly and respond quickly to customer questions or requests.</li>
    <li> This is great sunscreen! I use it on my face under my makeup. It works great. It is thin and smooth and not at all greasy or oily.  I also use it on my hands, arms, neck, and chest when I go outside with the kids. It blocks the sun and leaves my skin smooth and silky. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is wonderful. There is no strong smell to it and this one is all for the adults! I love the way it easily goes on not to thick not to watery and not greasy. It comes nicely packaged so would make a nice gift. Everyone should protect themselves from the suns harmful rays at 30% this is just right for me. I was sent this product free to review and give an honest opinion on.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! I have very fair skin (your typical Irish girl with reddish hair and freckles) and wore this every day for the past week in the outer banks in North Carolina.  It is non-greasy and didn&#x27;t even make my very sensitive skin break out at all, while also keeping it sun burn free and allowing some tanning!  Even my sisters and cousins wanted to use it! I would definitely recommend this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:1a6436385e257fa1b62e5ffd59d5fd37]] I live in Florida and sun protection is super important here. I also just had to have cancer removed from prior sun-damage so I am super vigilant about sun protection personally. This product is tough to convey over a written review but I will try. First of all it is beautifully packaged and has a high end feel. Like the Clairns stuff they sell at Macys in the cosmetics section) The product is unscented but does have a slight sunscreeney scent  which is not off putting but present. Applied it covers easily and evenly without any greasy feel or residue and absorbs easily. Basically it is everything you would want in a sunscreen in a pretty blue green package:) I intend to use this on my face since it is non comedogenic and wont clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure this was provided to me by the seller to review. Should you have any questions please leave a comment. Thanks:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Disclosure Statement:&lt;br /&gt;-I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review; or&lt;br /&gt;-I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;Why the statement? Amazon says I have to. Why did I get the product at a discount? I guess I’m lucky. Either way I hope the review was helpful. I try to do my best to update reviews but if you have any questions about my long term experience with a product please leave a comment and I will gladly respond.</li>
    <li> This product (Andre’ Lorent – Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen) has a nice-light application on the skin.  The product is non-greasy and has a moisturizing feel.  I believe it would work well as a skin protector under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for long sun exposure.  After one hour of applying it to my neck and chest areas, it did not feel like I had any product or protection on those areas.  I do not believe the density of this product is thick enough to protect the skin on hot and heavy perspiring days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample product for impartial review.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!! Smells amazing and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I received this sunscreen and have been using it for about eight days now. I&#x27;m always hesitant to use any new facial products because I have such sensitive skin. I usually break out with anything other than the products I get from my dermatologist. I decided to try this sunscreen, and not only did I NOT break out, but it has left my face and neck hydrated, soft and smooth. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  It feels like lotion and you do not feel sticky like you do with normal sunscreen. I even put it on my face and my eyes, which are very sensitive, did not burn as they do with other sunscreen.  It is truly scent free too so no one will know you are wearing sunscreen but you.  Wish I had found this before I went to the beach!!!</li>
    <li> I know they say you can’t judge a book by its cover, but sometimes I will pick certain products based on the color scheme of the product. The first thing that I loved about Andre Lorent Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen, is the color scheme.  I am a very visual person, and love bright, bold colors.  Second, I love the fact that the Andre Lorent Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen contains vitamins and antioxidants. It’s nice to find a product that will help protect you against the harmful rays of the sun, and help with anti-aging, as I finally hit an age where I am beginning to worry about that.  Third, I really liked the fact that this product was unscented, even though I was a little skeptical, because most unscented sunscreens still have that awful sunscreen smell to them.  When I received this product, I ripped open the box, took off the foil seal, and smelled it.  That awful sunscreen smell was almost nonexistent.  I then put a small amount on my wrist to see if it was too good to be true.  I was truly amazed, because the awful sunscreen smell truly was almost nonexistent.  I was also amazed how the Andre Lorent Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen felt on, it soaked in, and wasn’t greasy; it felt as if I had just put on my favorite lotion.  I left the Andre Lorent Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen on my wrist and checked to see how that spot felt every half an hour for two hours.  I loved the way it felt. The final test would be how it felt on my face and whether I broke out or not, since I am highly susceptible to break outs.  I am pleased to say that I did not break out while using Andre Lorent Daily Rehydrating Sunscreen.  I would definitely recommend this product to all my family and friends. I would also recommend it to people that I do not know.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Feels smooth and clear going on! No sunscreen goop. Leaves a healthy glow. I feel protected from the sun and look great&lt;br /&gt;makeup free! Stays on in high heat and humidity.</li>
    <li> My first impression when the box arrived was that it would be all about the package and the product would be disappointing. But I was wrong. I unsealed the sunscreen and put some on my arm. It was easy to squeeze and did not squirt out everywhere. The consistency was perfect. It went on very silky and it did not have an overwhelming &amp;#34;sunblock&amp;#34; smell. It left my skin with a nice sheen. After 3 hrs at the beach with 80 degree weather, it held up! I am very happy with Andre Lorent and love that it did not cause any break outs or rashes on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Received the sunscreen a few days ago and so far so good! I am pretty particular about sunscreen - it needs to be mostly natural, but effective.  Just as important to me, however, is how it goes on.  That milky/chalky look is fine for my kids - not me!  This went on very smooth - like a lotion! I used it yesterday while at an amusement park on a very sunny day - no sunburn!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it is now my daily sunscreen. I tried several, and this is my favorite</li>
    <li> Great product.  Not too oily or greasy.  Leaves my face glowing and refreshed. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but at the request of the company decided to.  I wanted to be able to use a sun screen everyday so I was looking for moisterizer with sunscreen protection - basically like a regular lotion vs a greasy sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve been very happy this and have been using it daily.  Thanks Andre Lorent!  One thing that is questionable is that the title says that it includes vitamins A, B, C, and E.  These are not formally listed as ingredients on the packaging, but on a sticker attached to the package.</li>
