<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok Did not hold the curl for long in either my daughters or my hair. But easy to use and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> I have to say from all the rave reviews on these curlers I was expecting to be blown away.  I was not.  No matter what heat setting I put them on - or for how long I left them in my hair, the curls didn&#x27;t take.  I was surprised because I have fine, straight hair that normally takes a curl quite easily.  I&#x27;m returning them and sticking with my curling iron.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this low stars is because I have been using my set I have had for the past 40 years. Talking about hot. These don&#x27;t measure up probably because of current regulations of limited heat. Other than that they held my hair as I rolled them up.</li>
    <li> They work great and leave a fun bouncy curl. The clips hold fine for me. No complaints there.</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up quickly</li>
    <li> The rollers work well, but the clips as are as bad as (if not worse than) advertised. Invest a little more and buy a set of the super clips (or something. Nothing could actually be worse than the ones they come with).</li>
    <li> THESE CURLERS HAVE A HEAT SETTING WHICH MEANS IF THEY ARE HOT ENOUGH TO BURN MY HEAD, I LOWER THE HEAT SETTING!!!  THIS IS A VERY GOOD FEATURE. SURPRISINGLY THIS IS NOT A FEATURE  ON ALL HOT CURLERS. THE CURLERS ARE EASY SO FAR AS ROLLING MY SHOULDER LENGTH HAIR, BUT OPENING THE CLIPS HURTS MY HAND.  THE CLIPS DO NOT SEEM TO BE MADE FOR HUMAN HANDS. I ORDERED SOME DIFFERENT CONAIR CLIPS AND NOW I AM VERY PLEASED.</li>
    <li> Great price for a decent roller set.  Love that there are settings.  I have wavy hair and just need to calm it with some warm rollers.  But these can get really hot if on the highest setting.  So rollers would probably be great for straight hair or hair that does not hold well.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone</li>
    <li> I love them.  They don&#x27;t get caught in my hair.</li>
    <li> great product fast service</li>
    <li> Rather large but I guess thats because of the retracting cord.  Have heat setting at highest level but admit to having difficult hair.</li>
    <li> The clips are not good for rolling  the top of the hair.  The large curlers are so big and I don&#x27;t have any others that will fit them to put the large ones on top of my head.  So not completely happy with them.  But love the retractable cord.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I had a set of wax hot rollers for many years.  By the end of their usefulness, I could hardly roll them up, they got so hot to the touch.  These are great because you can regulate the heat easily and they heat up fast...no waiting!  I also LOVE the clips which are kind of like clothes pins.  I highly recommend these, and I like them so much more than a curling iron. Irons take forever to curl my long-ish hair.  If I had six stars, these would get all of them.  Very well worth the price I paid for them!!</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old Conair Instant Heat rollers.  This heats up quickly and the flocked rollers are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy that after an hour it will turn off automatically as it doesn&#x27;t say this on outside of box only in directions that are enclosed. Certainly wish some of the rollers were a bit smaller as my hair is rather short in the back. However overall I am very satisfied with these rollers!</li>
    <li> I sent i t back, the clips that came with it were worthless and I wasn&#x27;t buying new clips in addition to what came with it, they should come with good clips that work.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does exactly what it says. There are rollers in three sizes to accommodate various hair styles, there are several heat settings,  and THE CORD IS RETRACTABLE!!! (Did I say that the cord is retractable?) You may want to buy the clips that are displayed alongside the product.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Makes my hair as curly as I want and nice and shiny.  After reading others&#x27; reviews and the complaints about the clips to hold the curlers in, I was concerned -- but didn&#x27;t really need to be. It took me a couple of times to figure out how to position the clips on the curlers so they stayed tight, but after I figured it out it was no problem.  I have very thick medium length hair.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves these curlers. She has used them everytime she goes out.</li>
    <li> The rollers do not heat well, due to the design. The clips to hold the rollers in place do not keep rollers in place. Overall I am disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is very thick and heavy and required 2 clips to hold the curlers in place. She loved the gift but would leave a crimp mark on her curl and  unfortunately had to go with another item for Mother&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Had a set of Conair for years with the simple wire clip.  The plastic clips that come with these leave a crimp mark on the hair and don&#x27;t stay rolled up.  AWEFUL  Wish I&#x27;d saved the packaging to return.  A waste of money!</li>
    <li> Pleased with the retractable cord,variety In size of rollers (they do heat up quickly). Somewhat disappointed in the clips not a tight fit and hair does come out of the roller because of this. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> Did not curl the hair properly.</li>
    <li> My hair is very straight and usually requires lots of hairspray to hold a curl--these rollers do a great job of creating a strong, long-lasting curl. The key is to let them heat up for 15 minutes and then to leave them in until completely cool. The clips that came with the set are perfect; easy to use and they don&#x27;t leave a ridge in the curl. I&#x27;m having fun experimenting with the different looks I can get by using more or fewer rollers. The large rollers aren&#x27;t as big as I thought they would be (wouldn&#x27;t call them &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34;) but I can roll all my hair (past shoulder-length) into just the large ones and have lovely loose curls that last for hours with no hairspray. My only reason for not giving five stars is that the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; edges of the rollers still get prett darn hot--you must move quickly or you&#x27;ll burn your fingers.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good.  Not as amazing as the reviews mentioned</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than others because of on-off switch and adjustable heat.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and would buy it again if something ever happened to this one.</li>
    <li> Doesnt burn your hair and the curls stay for a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lock....perfect set!</li>
    <li> These rollers are great and they don&#x27;t fry your hair.  You do need to get different clips... the ones that come with them make a dent in your hair.</li>
    <li> Not as good as baby bliss, takes longer to heat up and the clips are just useless. I&#x27;m keeping it for travel, or it would have sent it back.</li>
    <li> Works great! I don&#x27;t burn my fingers or scalp! Gives great curls!  Somebody mentioned before that the power cord is not retractable.....well it is! Which this is another great feature!!  It comes with 20 clips, but I highly recommend getting the Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count, to go along with these hot rollers. You&#x27;d be surprised that they work better on the larger rollers in this set.</li>
    <li> This unit does get REALLY HOT - to the point of burning your fingers - but that should mean BETTER CURL, right?  I have layers, so I will say that the shorter pieces of hair were VERY CURLED, while the longer hair did not do very well.  I curled my hair twice on the same day, trying to get a feel for these rollers.  The 2nd time, I used the medium rollers on my longer hair, still didn&#x27;t do much.  I am giving a &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; because I believe if all of your hair is a short length, this would work GREAT FOR YOU.  But it&#x27;s not for me.  I have better luck with my curling iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many sets over the years. I don&#x27;t need the temperature feature but the case is nice. The clips are good but a bought a set of spring clips with lots of teeth to use instead. It does its job.</li>
    <li> I like these- have had them about a year.  They get very hot by the ridges that they rest in so you have to be careful.  They work well though.  And I have used a fair amount of heated rollers in my lifetime.  I researched before I bought and Amazon had the beet price.</li>
    <li> Curls that hold!! Finally. I have very thick hair (If I pull it into a pony tail I cannot close my thumb and forefinger around the base of the pony) and it is quite long (down to my bum). All my life I have fussed with my stick straight hair trying to get it to exhibit more topography for special occasions. Sleep in rollers make me look like a clown the next day, so do hot sticks. Traditional curling irons just damage my hair and the curl falls out immediately. These curlers are the only thing thats works. If I use them without hair spray I get soft beachy curls. When I use aqua net along the length of the hair before rolling, I get sculpted big curls that are still there the morning after clubbing all night. Only downside is that I told my sister how great they are and now I have to snag em before she does when we are getting ready for an event.</li>
    <li> I have not used curlers for years but my hair is really thick and the curling wands take entirely too much time.  This is flocked which means it stays in the hair very well.  They have about six big rollers and those are all I need for my shoulder layered length hair.  I have it up in two minutes, leave up for about ten minutes and I run a pick through it and I am out the door.  I love, love love it!  My hair has nice curl since using big curlers and it hangs beautifully.  I posted pics on FB and friends commented liking the pic.  One caveat. If you want your hair to be curly for more than a few hours you would have to leave it in longer and probably have to use more curlers than I do.  It is convenient enough for me to put them in just before I go out if I want it wavy or a slight curl that day.</li>
    <li> I love the temperature gauge that allows you to regulate how hot the rollers get. My older unit didn&#x27;t have this and the rollers were so hot especially the ones that had the flocking worn off in spots. I also like the retractable power cord. The unit works great and I would recommend it to anyone that likes hot rollers for styling. Very happy with my purchase !</li>
    <li> Great quality.  I had an ancient hot roller set that lasted forever then finally quit on me.  When my old set heated up, the rollers were very hot on the hands and head but did a great job.  When I first used these I was skeptical because they didn&#x27;t feel hot.  I tried them and they are terrific.  I have long fine hair (but a lot of it, so very thick) and this does a beautiful job.  The clips are nice too.</li>
    <li> I bought this model because it has a retractable cord, which works great and I love it. The only downside are the clips. They look like breast cancer awareness bows and have fishtail ends that stick way out from your head. I was hoping to be able to put these rollers in, throw a shower cap over them and take a shower/get ready to leave the house. Not happening! No shower cap in the world is big enough to cover the giant clips that come with this. I also don&#x27;t think the clips hold the roller well enough; they flop around on my head, they&#x27;re not very tight or secure. Also, Conair gives you a drawstring bag to keep the clips in, which is nice, but then you have to find somewhere to put the bag. I have it hanging on my bathroom doorknob. For a compact machine with cord reel, they sure didn&#x27;t think through the rest of it. I will try the metal pins, but in general I do recommend this hot roller set.</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace an older version that I had for almost 20 years.  Those actually still work but the lid had broken and the velvet flocking was starting to wear off.  Not bad for 20 years.  I hope this set lasts as long.  For my long, fine hair - these clips work the best and hold the rollers in place.  (I do use two per roller.). I have bought and returned other brands because the clips didn&#x27;t hold.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers.  I ordered the white clips, sold with these on Amazon.  These rollers get nice and hot and are easy to use. I don&#x27;t like the clips that come with the set; they didn&#x27;t hold the rollers in which maybe because my hair is shorter than it should be for these.  All in all a good selection of sizes, heats up well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Off/on switch&lt;br /&gt;Shuts off after one hour&lt;br /&gt;Heat settings from one - low to high of 12&lt;br /&gt;Base doesn&#x27;t heat up which means it won&#x27;t damage the surface you use it on.  The heating element is above the base, right under the roller.&lt;br /&gt;Cord retracts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bulky, not convenient for travel-this isn&#x27;t a con for me, but want to let folks know this is not a compact unit.&lt;br /&gt;Clips that come with it don&#x27;t hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these rollers highly.  A little more expensive than the $12.99 sets you can pick up at Wal-Mart, but the extra features are worth it.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, storage is an issue. It is a bit bulky, but functionality is great.</li>
    <li> This Infiniti Pro Instant Heat Ceramic is everything I was hoping for.  It also has a great feature that I did not know about.&lt;br /&gt;If you forget to unplug it, it turns it&#x27;s self off.</li>
    <li> wife likes it.  She&#x27;s happy, I;m happy.  They really get instant hot.  She threw away the old one with no regret.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like it a lot, glad I purchased this-- they are a little hot to handle.. makes it difficult, but not a big problem. Hair comes out real nice-- like a salon blow-out. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Great product which does wonders for your hair. You may turn the heating element up or down.</li>
    <li> This is fine, though the cord does not return &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; the base, so you have to wrap it everytime.  I prefer the Infiniti, where the cord is retractable.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s dependable and a good Conair product.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift and my mom loves them.  She said they work great and get really hot really fast.</li>
    <li> Great very easy to use and fast, you get great results. The rollers heat up really quickly. Mine came with a small bottle of argan oil which smells so good and leaves your hair really soft.</li>
    <li> The rollers work great and leaves my hair feeling great. I would have given 5 stars but the clips are a little easy to pop off but still work ok.</li>
    <li> wife would like more smaller curlers in the unit</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Gets very hot. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wish you would put the pins with the curlers.</li>
    <li> Works great. If not careful hair can get caught in the ends.</li>
    <li> Much better than the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; hot rollers of the past. Would like to have more medium and small rollers for my hair, however.  Still a very good set and a good buy for my money.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really tried it yet.  Have read the directions and will put it to good use soon.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic rollers.  I have long fine hair.... but lots of it.  These curlers get nice and HOT and work great.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  Clips not perfect but work well.  Best she has ever had.</li>
    <li> This is the best product in this price range, even better in comparison to more expensive sets. I like the fact that I can adjust the heat volume, and that it offers me a variety of roller sizes.. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of counter space, it&#x27;s compact enough to take it on your travels. The clips are very functional and holds the rolls in place.</li>
    <li> These rollers get way too hot. Even though they have an adjustable heat setting. My hair has gotten dryer and more damaged since using these rollers. I had another Conair for about 4 years and loved them. They never overheated like this setter does! It sure is hard to find a good hair setter these days!</li>
    <li> These work almost as well as the old set I had that died after 10 years and a fall to the ground.  I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!  I have graying, chin length hair and have been using a curling iron for years.  My hair has become dry looking lately so I decided to try hot rollers again after about 30 years.  Well, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them!  My hair is smoother and doesn&#x27;t look dry at all.  I wear my hair in a bob style.  These roller heat very well and stay in my fine hair.  They come with the same number of clips as rollers, so you don&#x27;t need to purchase extra.</li>
    <li> My beautician says I have a bushel basket full of hair even when it is short. It is medium in between fine and coarse, I guess. When I use these hot curlers, my hair stays set all day and looks pretty good - if I do say so myself. The Infini Pro is easy to use and heats quickly. I am not a good person to wait around to beautify myself so that is good, too. Whenever I really want to try to look decent, I use my hot rollers and I am always pleased with the results. The clips hold without slipping and it does not take a long time like a curling iron does. As I said, my hair stays set all day and even the next day my hair looks halfway decent which is always a pleasant surprise. I recommend this product for hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how to use hot curlers, but had an event, and purchased these at the last minute. Mind you, I have no expertise with hair, and I believe I did a sufficient job, and got a bunch of compliments on my curls at the event. These are really easy to use, and make a nice curl. Enough curlers in this box for a whole head of long hair.</li>
    <li> Dear Infiniti,&lt;br /&gt;Make roller clips that fit over the ENTIRE roller!  Seriously, I did not like at all.  Went back to using my Caruso Steam Setter!  I though I would try the heat rollers - but yuk!  The clips don&#x27;t hold and my steam setter works so much better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but didn&#x27;t feel these got hot enough.  I also don&#x27;t need the big rollers but would rather have more medium and small ones and I don&#x27;t see on Amazon or any place on Conair where I can buy extra of the size I need.  I may just return this, not worth it I think.  I also found this to be more work than just using a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of heated rollers.  2nd one I bought.  Same model.</li>
    <li> Finally shot roller set that gets really hot. I&#x27;ve ordered so may sets and even bought an expensive set with the hope and expectation that they would get hot not just warm. These really do the trick. If you want hot &amp;#34;hot rollers&amp;#34; this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> The clips that come with them suck! Other than that I am still trying to get the hang of them</li>
    <li> I like the product in general, but detest the clips that hold the rollers. Every time I move the rollers on top of my head flip forward. The clips need to be wider on the bottom so that they will stay in one spot. The variable heat is a good feature.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers. They heat up fast and work great!</li>
    <li> My wife is rolling her hair like it was the eighties again. I love it.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying these rollers- I got them to experiment with vintage roller setting- I have thick long hair which has made rollers impracticable especially when  large rollers were all the rage but this is a versatile set. they heat up quickly &amp; did j mention the cord is retractable?!! The clips that come with it are ok like other reviews said similarly I had better luck with &amp;#34;u&amp;#34; clips. There are small,med, and large rollers and the smallest creates  a nice curl but not too Shirley temple  these are perfect for me! I included a pic of the curls after sever hours of wear without a setting spray- love them!</li>
    <li> It wasa present the person seems happy</li>
    <li> This blows the expensive BaByliss roller set out of the water. They&#x27;re velvet flocked, heat very quickly as promised, deliver a curl, have multiple size rollers, and get the job done while protecting hair. Love the retractable chord. Wish they came with the metal &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; holders but the plastic clamp kind work just fine... and I can always use my old metal &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; holders since they&#x27;re the right size.</li>
    <li> Best thing to have happened for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t burn your hair while still styling it in a short period of time. It takes me 2 hours at most. But that&#x27;s because I have long hair and I hold the rollers in for a longer time.</li>
    <li> I love the curlers, but the clips are terrible.  The curlers heat quickly and I am very happy with them.  The clips do not hold the rollers well.  The cheap wire holders work better.</li>
    <li> I have only used them once and was very pleased with how long my hair kept the curl.  I have fairly long, straight hair and have never been able to retain curls for more than an hour. I don&#x27;t roll my hair often but am letting it grow out and need some options. I used these on the highest setting and let them heat for about 10 minutes and left them in my hair until cool. They were very hot and a little hard to handle, but I think that is normal.&lt;br /&gt;  Now for the reason I did not give them 5 stars....I was not pleased with the clips. I assumed that they were claw clips, similar to the kind you use in your hair. These clips are spring loaded type clips but have only one &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34;, for lack of a better word, on each side. They did not hold the curlers on the top of the head, but I was able to use some hair clips on them. I had almost ordered an extra set of the claw clips when I ordered the curlers as they were a no shipping add-on item with Amazon but didn&#x27;t. Now I wish I had. So, overall I think they will work well for me but will keep an eye out for other clips!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this Conair several times and some roller get hot and some just get warm no matter how long I have it on disappointed because it wasn&#x27;t cheap and I expected more from Conair I have another one not as well equipped with extras but the lid got cracked and it doesn&#x27;t get hot just warm</li>
    <li> This product heats up quickly and the flocked rollers protect hair from damage. It should be noted that the rollers must be left in for a little longer time since they are so gentle.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of curlers.  The sizes are good and the retractable cord is nice for storage so don&#x27;t have to have it dangling. The flocked curlers are great for fine hair because they don&#x27;t tangle.  I do not like the clips so ordered a couple sets of the old metals ones.  I will review them separately.</li>
    <li> Bought these from major brick-and-mortar beauty retailer (better price, no-shipping hassle). Have lots of long, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t generally hold curl/volume so I have this a shot. Set has perfect number of rollers and made my hair very smooth. Looked great while at home, but volume and curl both disappeared less than half an hour after I left my house. I felt the product was well designed (cord retractor took some practice) but not a great fit for my hair.</li>
    <li> These are everything they say they are.  Terrific product.  I only wish I had a travel size because I hate leaving these behind.  Since I buy a lot of &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products like curling irons, etc., I was totally excited about how these perform.  Don&#x27;t pass them up.</li>
    <li> I love that there are many sizes. I never run out or have to wait for some to heat up.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I don&#x27;t recommend for anyone with short, fine or thin hair though as the clips are a bit hard to get to stay in. They heat up super fast and they make my hair look naturally curly! I bought the extra white clips because I thought the clips that came with it wouldn&#x27;t hold but the white clips left crimping marks on my hair.</li>
    <li> Asset, the curlers heat up quickly and provided a substantial curl.  The bothersome part is that the electrical wire does not retract easily.  Consequently, it has to be wrapped around, when not in use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I like the retractable cord and the fact that it has different heat settings.  I think that it is the nicest one that I have ever had.  I bought the white roller holders which others had recommended, but, I think I like the free ones that came with the rollers better.  The white ones seem very flimsy.  Not worth the extra $10 that I paid for them.</li>
    <li> The curler set is great, but the clips that come with it are ridiculous. They don&#x27;t fit or stay in place at all. Luckily I had read previous recommendations for the product and I bought a separate set of &#x27;normal&#x27; clips - Pro Touch Hot Roller Clips. I would definitely recommend buying the separate clips - in fact I would recommend buying 2 sets so you have sufficient clips in the different sizes.</li>
    <li> The infiniti pro by conair exceeded my expectations I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The rollers in this set are not as large as described on the website. The largest rollers are described as 1 3/4 inches but they are only 1 1/4 inches.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this item.  The rollers simply do not get hot enough, even set at the highest level - unless of course, I am doing something incorrectly. Also I find the clamps that hold the rollers difficult to handle and they do not hold well.</li>
    <li> I think anyone considering buying the Infiiniti Pro should know that Conair does not recognize this model number, HS41, and has declared that additional curlers are not available. Since the heating rods accept all three sizes of curlers, the ability to adjust the sizes of curlers was  a big selling point for me. There is an instruction and styling guide that comes with the rollers and it contains instructions for ordering additional rollers. According to the Conair Service Department that is evidently mythology, so buyer beware. I also think Amazon has some responsibility for selling what is a discontinued (although nobody at Conair admitted it had ever existed) model.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, so even though the Conair Infinity Pro brush does a great job, it takes a long time to do one curl at a time and then wait.  I am much faster with the Ceramic rollers, and getting better with practice.  At first I hated the clips, but again--a little practice and they are working well.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my mom and she loves them. She uses the hair clips from her old set, the clips they came with will cause a crease in your hair. They work well but use the thin metal clips instead of the plastic butterfly clips</li>
    <li> This is a very good hot roller set.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this set.  Rollers heat very quickly and temperature is adjustable.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the wire clips for holding the rollers in hair.  Luckily I saved the plastic clips from my old Conair set.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Much improved over the electric rollers I used to have back when I was in high school.  I have very fine hair and this actually did curl my hair.  Much quicker to use than the curling iron.  I liked the newer style clips to hold the rollers in place also.</li>
    <li> I looked for nice flocked rollers for a long time before I settled on these.  The case size is pretty small so they don&#x27;t take up much room.  Retractable cord is a nice feature.  The clips are okay, they dont crease your hair as much as some other styles, but I wish these rollers came with metal pin type clips.  It wouldve been 5 stars if I had thise pins! They heat up quickly and do a great job curling. I would reccomend these for sure.  I have med-long thin wavy hair and these rollers work for me.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed and angry that I ordered these rollers. This is my first time using them and I can&#x27;t get the clips to hold the rollers. The clips are terrible.  I have short hair and that makes it easy for the rollers to drop down from their weight (heavy).  If you have short hair and it is fine, I don&#x27;t think this set would work for you. I did spend a lot of time reading reviews of various models- there are all kinds of hot rollers out there. But, I didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to the people who said the clips were terrible!!!    I called the Conair company to see if they could help. They are unbelievable and did not even have this model on their computer.  So, I could get no help at all.    The problem is that the clips only have ONE prong on each side. They need to be wide, sort of like fork prongs, but wider of course. I&#x27;m mad that I had to waste so much of my time, get nowhere and now have to go to the post office and send this back.    If you have short hair, DON\\&quot;T buy this!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brand several times. I replaced my older version which I&#x27;ve had for several years. It&#x27;s very easy to use. It has great clips and an adjustable heat setting.</li>
    <li> This is for my wife, but she loves them , very sturdy, long lasting.It&#x27;s the only kind she likes</li>
    <li> The large rollers could be alittle larger but overall I am satisfied.</li>
