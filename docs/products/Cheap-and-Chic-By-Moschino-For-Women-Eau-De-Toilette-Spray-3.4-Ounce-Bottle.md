      <li>it is original one i got.</li>
      <li>And yes, it is the original.</li>

      <li>Since I&#x27;m buying this item through Amazon I was confident even though it was sold by a third party seller.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>(Looks like it was cut out intentionally so it can not be sold as new).  </li>
      <li>Of course you are not going to find fixed up package sold as new at the legitimate store</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even remember where I first tested it out, but I get more compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this than any of the hundreds of other scents I&#x27;ve tried over the past 15+ years.</li>
      <li>The original packaging was cut &amp; peeled out in few places in the front and completely in the back</li>
      <li>Read some other reviews and was very concerned!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The item was just as expected and shipping was fast and reliable.</li>
      <li>My wife says it is the real deal, because her previous bottle she bought in Italy and smell the same.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m terrible at describing perfumes, but it&#x27;s not overbearing or flowery/fruity, just a beautiful classic scent with a hint of sexy/spicy in it.</li>

    <li> This product is exactly as described and the real perfume... never seen such a good price as this is the largest size.</li>
    <li> Great perfume! very cheap, and the bottle is huge. Was very concerned about the quality, if the product wasn&#x27;t original etc. Read some other reviews and was very concerned! But when I received the product, it was amazing! And yes, it is the original. I was using this perfume in the past, bought it from Italy, and it is the exact same perfume.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m buying this item through Amazon I was confident even though it was sold by a third party seller.  However, when I received the product, package appeared to have been corrected.  The original packaging was cut &amp; peeled out in few places in the front and completely in the back (Looks like it was cut out intentionally so it can not be sold as new).  Reprinted sticker was attached on top of the original packaging.  Of course you are not going to find fixed up package sold as new at the legitimate store but this one was sold at a discounted price.  My wife who use this product thinks inside seems like a genuine article.  My guess is seller bought this as defective/reject item at a low wholesale price, fix or in this case tape over the damage area, and sold it.  I guess I could&#x27;ve returned it but you get what you pay for right?  And in this case you are using what&#x27;s inside the box.   If it wasn&#x27;t for the patched up packaging I would give the seller and the product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this perfume is real or it went bad. All I can say it didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
    <li> it is original one i got. the smell lasts during long period and is strong (fake fragrances smell like it mised with water 50/50). the box has good quality, the bottle has the appropriate label. excellent price and superfast delivery.</li>
    <li> My wife used to have this perfume like 8 years ago... Smelling her with this now brings all kind of memories from those times. Same quality as always. Great perfume.</li>

    <li> My wife loves this perfume</li>
    <li> It is such an awesome thing.</li>
    <li> good price, fast shipment, nicely packaged and I didn&#x27;t have to waste gas driving around looking for it.  would order again....thanks</li>
    <li> I really enjoy wearing this perfume. It is not overpowering and lasts just about all day. The price on amazon is the best I found. I purchased the larger sized bottle and I am happy with the product. Delivery was quick and packaging was good. This perfume is great for all groups and can go from day to evening - my opinion.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent, but you can&#x27;t get it anywhere anymore!
