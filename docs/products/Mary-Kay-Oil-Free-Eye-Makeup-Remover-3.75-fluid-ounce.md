      <li>This items seemed to be the original solutions.</li>

      <li>Really like using this!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and won&#x27;t use anything else :-) ...</li>

      <li>Then gently wipe away</li>
      <li>Plus, I feel like I really need to scrub my eyelashes when using the makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>

      <li>THis one will really get your make up off.</li>
      <li>it works really well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this eye makeup remover works very well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Made my wife very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I use just an eye pencil and not-waterproof mascara on the daily basis but am not impressed w. a quality of this product. Have to rub and rub and rub trying to remove make up. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price. removes mascara fully. no lingering residue on the lash once wiped off with this product.</li>
    <li> Will order again, no problems!!</li>
    <li> This  item works great! Better than most other makeup removers i have tried! I will definitely buy this again when mine uses up.</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp;#34;eye makeup remover&amp;#34; ever... I have tried different brands and expensive ones... but this is the best!!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this makeup remover! I have very sensitive skin and it works so well, I basically use it every day.</li>
    <li> i love this eye makeup remover. so smooth and doesnt bother my eyes and gets my makeup off really well.</li>
    <li> This product is not authentic it is mixed with another substance. I have use the authentic Mary Kay I make up remover for several years in ran out so I ordered this one on Amazon. You can see clearly in the middle where there&#x27;s a separation of different liquids. Stay away !!</li>
    <li> I never run out of this product.  It is the best make up revomer there is esp eye make up.  And it leaves the skin moisturized and supple.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am so happy i can still get this on here. I love this but it&#x27;s the only Mary Kay product i use. I don&#x27;t like being bothered by someone trying to sell me other stuff when i just want/need this product.</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover is the best, it takes off makeup so fast and easy no matter what color you have on. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the eye. Excellent product will definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> There is none better!</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product about 6 months ago and love it!&lt;br /&gt;It takes my eye make up off easily and leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth ..&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several different eye make up removers in the past and this is by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter wears waterproof mascara and this removes it with ease!&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other makeup removers before, and most of them burn my eyes. But not Mary Kay Oil Free Makeup Remover. I have used before and love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend, she needed some stuff and this was one of the things on her list.  She is a single mom and they come last. Best eye makeup remover out there!</li>
    <li> I love this product and it lasts forever. This is my second bottle. The first one lasted me forever. Wonderful product and if you have sensitivity with products bothering your eyes like I do, this product has never bothered me at all. Wonderful product and goes a long way. A little will do the job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this eye makeup remover works very well.  I use it to remove 1-2 coats of waterproof mascara, and I have to apply it several times, wash my face with a regular cleanser, re-apply the makeup remover and wash my face again - and I still wake-up with a lot of mascara under my eyes.  Plus, I feel like I really need to scrub my eyelashes when using the makeup remover.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> it says oil free but it leaves your face oily.</li>
    <li> Very good. Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
    <li> Oily and does not work efficiently.</li>
    <li> I like this eye makeup remover the best because it&#x27;s easy.  One swipe and your shadow is removed.  It&#x27;s oil-free too.  Removes even the most stubborn mascara and eyeliner</li>
    <li> First tried this product a few years ago and did not like.  Tried again and instead of using a cotton ball used a tissue and it worked a lot better.  Now I can&#x27;t liv without!</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried lots of eye makeup remover.  This one is better than most and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  I haven&#x27;t found one yet, though, that takes it all off.  It is such a drag that I don&#x27;t often wear mascara and eye liner often anymore.</li>
    <li> I LOVE being able to buy my Mary Kay online.  I never have to worry about keeping up with a Mary Kay supplier.  I have bought this item for a friend of mine before, and finally decided to get it for my daughter.  I am so glad I did.  It&#x27;s a great product.  Sometimes my skin and my daughters skin gets a little oily but this product doesn&#x27;t add to the oil.  It&#x27;s oil free and fabulous</li>
    <li> I have been using this makeup remover for years and love it.  I have tried many and I don&#x27;t like them as much as I like this one.  I wear a lot of waterproof makeup and this gets it off so easy.</li>
    <li> It works adequately, but doesn&#x27;t remove all the water proof mascara as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  It is the Mark Kay Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, which is a plus,</li>
    <li> The only thing i give this product 4 star is because i received it open and the box was all wet of the product - _-  otherwise it works good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about the only product around that works well.  Even so, there can be some residual makeup in the morning, despite careful efforts.</li>
    <li> gentle on the lashes and works wonderfully on my waterproof mascara!</li>
    <li> This items seemed to be the original solutions. Just what I needed to get rid of cover girls stubborn mascara</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over 20 years and it still works the best</li>
    <li> Continues to the only make-up remover that works without irretating my eyes!</li>
    <li> this is the best product for removing waterproof mascra</li>
    <li> I tried this once to see if it compared to my other brand which was more expensive and I ended up liking this one even better. Will continue to use. It takes off all eye make up very easily and a bottle seems to last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I use nothing else, works perfect!!! Must have!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. it works really well. I tried to use the ELF make up remover wipes for my eyes but it&#x27;s just not the same as this. THis one will really get your make up off. Especially the mascara. I wear mascara primer so it makes it even harder to get my mascara off but with this product it comes off so much easier.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye makeup removers I have ever used. I have used this product for years. It removes all traces of my makeup even waterproof.</li>
    <li> Really like using this!  It works effectively, And I don&#x27;t have to scrub at my lashes!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> BEST eye makeup remover EVER!! Esp for waterproof mascara</li>
    <li> This is an improvement over their older version. Love it. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do without leaving a mess.</li>
    <li> Happy with product and in speedy time</li>
    <li> I have never used another product since trying the MK makeup remover over 10 years ago.  It is gentle on your skin and gets everything off.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality product.</li>
    <li> Shopping Amazon saves me having to go out and find a Mary Kay representative and is just what Santa needed to fill his bag!</li>
    <li> This works better than more expensive makeup removers. Very gentle yet effective. Nice smell and removes even the heaviest eye makeup. Great product!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better than other eye make up remover, but, it&#x27;s really not.  I do love other MK products though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but leaves the skin too oily. That makes me not like it</li>
    <li> Received the product in a timely manner and the price was fair.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price. removes mascara fully. no lingering residue on the lash once wiped off with this product.</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover is FANTASTIC!!! Have been useing this for years and I have tried others, some are not what they say, some are too expensive.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup Remover on the market.</li>
    <li> best eye makeup remover ever!</li>
    <li> I love my Estee Lauder black gel liner b/c it doesn&#x27;t wear or smudge, even on a 12-hour day...but b/c it stays so well, it&#x27;s a bear to take off.  But the Mary Kay remover works great on it. Just a note:  I went to a Mary Kay party where they demonstrated this item, and here&#x27;s how to get it to remove eye makeup properly.  (I notice some reviewers didn&#x27;t think it worked well, and the directions on the bottle itself don&#x27;t give proper instructions, so just thought I&#x27;d share here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should look a bit like oil and water inside the bottle, clearly separated (although it is oil-free).  Shake it up for a few seconds.  Then apply the remover to a cotton ball.  Place the cotton ball on your closed eye and hold it there gently for about 10 seconds.  Then gently wipe away makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use the eye makeup remover first, then wash my face.  Love this product and definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery! Amazing make up remover! I love this product my water proof make up wipes off instantly no excessive rubbing doesn&#x27;t get oily on my skin or in my eyes. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> So I wear water proof eyeliner on the top and bottom of my eyes and I have to see this stuff kicks a!% .....I have tried the a few drug store products among other things but nothing in my (valuable lol) opinion works as well as this .....soooo if u wear eye makeup and can never really get it all off...feel like a raccoon because of it....get this ...you can buy it as cheap as 12.00 incl Your shipping which works for me cause I&#x27;m a bargain hunter.......BUY IT! ...I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and won&#x27;t use anything else :-) ...bye</li>
    <li> This is the only makeup remover I will ever use. Your makeup comes off so easily and it is soft to the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than a lot of eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve ever tried and I have tried expensive ones. You get a lot for the price, it easy on your eyes (no irritations), it removes most mascaras without residue, except for a few hard to remove ones. With those, you have to go at it a second time. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this make up remover. Works great</li>
    <li> It´s a wonderful product.  It takes off eye makeup quickly!  Also, I received it promptly, which I was happy about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> Best eye make up remover out there!</li>
    <li> The Mary Kay Oil Free Eye Makeup Remover is one of the better makeup removers IMO b/c it glides without pulling the delicate tissue around the eyes, (very important!), it works immediately with a small amount, and it really is oil free.</li>
    <li> The best eye makeup remover out there! I will never use any thing else! Makeup comes off with ease so there is less damage to delicate eye area.</li>
    <li> excellent  I am very HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASES.  I need to buy Mary Kay Cleanser.  Do you carry it?  I love Mary KAY PRODUCTS.  WHAT DO YOU MEAN A HEAD LINER?</li>
    <li> Got a free sample of this years ago and have not been without it since.  Haven&#x27;t even tried anything else.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Very easy to get my makeup off now and a single bottle lasts me almost a year.  Well worth the price</li>
    <li> It removes my eyeliner, mascara, and eye brow pencil quickly and without much rubbing...even the waterproof products. It has never irritated my eyes either, even when I wear my contacts. I highly recommend this product. I received this in less than a week.</li>
    <li> great product, fast ship</li>
    <li> Great love it especially the price</li>
