    <li> Seem to only last half as long as other batteries.  Low price, but you get what you pay for,  Liked many others better.</li>
    <li> thats battery died 3 times faster than other brands</li>
    <li> They seem to work just as good as the batteries from the Cochlear company. I will continue to purchase these.</li>
    <li> Super hearing aid batteries-Long lasting and 1/10th the price of Wally Mart. One pack of 60 is about the same price of a six pack at any drug stor</li>
    <li> THESE BATTERIES LAST FAR LONGER THAN EXPECTED. I HAD HOPED TO GET A FEW DAYS USAGE PER BATTERY, BUT I FIND I GET OVER A WEEK&#x27;S WORTH</li>
    <li> My father is need of bulk quantities of batteries for his hearing aids. This is the same brand his doctor gave him. Great price and easy transaction, as normal with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> The price was good, but the reliability is questionable.  We bought these to save some money on our daughter&#x27;s hearing aid batteries, but we&#x27;ve found they don&#x27;t last as long as the Duracells we used to get.  In fact one of them recently lasted only 2 days.  I haven&#x27;t done the math, but I would bet the &amp;#34;cost per day&amp;#34; is better with another product.</li>
    <li> I have hours of hearing to look forward to with this box of batteries.  There are many in the box so I can leave them all over - at work, in the car, on my yacht (okay, no yacht).  I&#x27;ll always have a battery within reach to hear the gossamer tones of my loved ones.  What grabbed me was per unit price.  I&#x27;ll now feel ripped off buying Duracells.</li>
    <li> Awesome . Last longer than any battery we ever used for my husband&#x27;s hearing aids. What used to last couple days lasts over a week +.  Great product. Will buy more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> ...is still a battery!&lt;br /&gt;This is a re-order because I was impressed by how long they lasted in my hearing aids and in the speedy shipping in getting them to me. Repeat customers are the highest form of praise, along with recommending to others...I am doing both!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too bad for a long lasting  batteries for my hearing aid. I would say it could be at least 3 weeks by the time is dead.</li>
    <li> Good price and like the idea it is in packs of 6 rather than 4.  I use for my Cochlear implant and a much better price than Cochlear and stores offer.  Implant calls for 3 batteries, so 6 makes since.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal.  I go through these batteries with my grandchildren&#x27;s toys.&lt;br /&gt;Company delivered very quickly and a great value.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t understand how I could find so many negative reviews about these batteries when I have had no problems at all with them and have gone through 3 changes as of this writing. I wear a pair of Phonak Naida IX UP&#x27;s and 2 batteries last me 18-19 days. I have read about these batteries lasting only 1 day to even rusting. Let me say I have NOT experienced anything unusual since I have been using them for the past 2 months. If I do, I will leave another follow-up review stating any problems that may occur.  It&#x27;s been one year since I wrote the above review. Absolutely no problems with these batteries what so ever. Time to reorder!  7/2016 ... I have been using these batteries since 2010. I just received my 4th reorder. No complaints.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT DESCRIPTION! EXCELLENT SELLER!</li>
    <li> great price, even better batteries.air zinc battery is lighter than other battery type and last just as long if not longer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pointless paying $8 for 8 batteries when you can get 60 for this price and they last the same amount of time. I&#x27;ve been using them for weeks now and there&#x27;s no difference from the store bought Raynovac batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It is now Jan 19, 2014, a little over a year later and I finally ran out of hearing aid batteries! One box lasted me an entire year. Imagine how much that saved me over buying retail batteries!</li>
    <li> Good batteries that do the job.</li>
    <li> There is a huge difference in your charges compared to the local sales of them around here,,you offer a big savings when buying the batteries ,,(675) from you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with your batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you  Mr. A. Kushner</li>
    <li> Do not order these for cochlear implant, Order P675.  These only last 10-12 hours.  P675 last 3+ days.</li>
    <li> At first I must admit I was a little skeptical but after purchasing them and using them I am impressed they have the same battery life quality as Ever Ready!</li>
    <li> I got these to see how they work. For me they last a long time. I would recommend these for people who need this size for your hearing aids.</li>
    <li> I purchased these batteries for my son  who wears hearing aids. We have been paying quite a bit for them at the store. I decided to look online, and came across these. They arrived on time, and seem to be working perfectly.</li>
    <li> Well worth their very low price.</li>
    <li> Best product, best price</li>
