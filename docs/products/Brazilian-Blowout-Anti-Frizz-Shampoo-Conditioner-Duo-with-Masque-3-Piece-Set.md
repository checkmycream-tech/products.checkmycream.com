      <li>Need more.</li>
      <li>Prices on theseroducts can vary so I was happy to find all 3 at what is normally the price of just shampoo.</li>

      <li>It keeps hair straight and smooth up to 4 days in spite of humidity or till you wash it.</li>
      <li>I still did not need to use the masque cause the shampoo and conditioner leaves the hair só nice that its is almost enough!</li>
      <li>This treatment will make you hair more controllable, will take away all the freeze and make the straightening process with a flat iron waaaay easier and faster, specially if using the thermal balm.</li>
      <li>exactly what i buy at l</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
      <li>The products really help to keep it that way.</li>
      <li>The seller, however, was very gracious &amp; allowed me to return for a refund</li>
      <li>This treatment wont change your hair in a way that if you have it curly it will make it straight.</li>
      <li>I can get my hair silky straight, I need products to hold the style &amp; keep it straight.</li>
      <li>I have really damage hair do to bleaching.</li>
      <li>I have a brazillian blowout and have not found anything else that makes my hair straight and shiney.</li>
      <li>better than the other stuff.</li>
      <li>Product came early and is exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>I live in a really humid place and since the treatment and this product frizz is not a problem anymore.</li>
      <li>I live in georgia where it is very humid.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to any one who has the Brazilian blowout treatment.</li>
      <li>My hair is always so soft and straight after using the BBK.</li>
      <li>and I have received compliments asking if I have gotten a new cut.  </li>
      <li>a professional</li>
      <li>The real deal and cheaper than at local salons.</li>
      <li>, I really see the different in my hair</li>
      <li>Its my favorite and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>hair felt dry after using this &amp; it was really unruly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
      <li>So I think this might work well for someone who&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t naturally frizz out &amp; go in 10 different directions.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i noticed that my hair was always silkier longer than when I washed it at home with my other high end products (Redken,Pravana etc.).</li>
      <li>I have long, thin hair that is difficult at best.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure this is even the real product as you cannot even buy it for that cost as a hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Straight and thick.</li>
<li> It truly is different from any other shampoo and works like a charm.</li>
<li> when you have course surly hair like mine and finally find somehting that works, you don&#x27;t care about a few extra $.</li>
<li> Yes, I use it on my curly hair to provide extra conditioning and keep the frizzy down.  </li>
<li> Made my hair very dry.</li>
<li> Received when expected.</li>
<li> It says to apply a moderate amount of product to towel dried hair from the roots to the ends.  </li>
<li> Paired with a little bit of the masque.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, but this product gunked my hair up &amp; made it very heavy.</li>
<li> It always makes my hair feel greasy even with a small amount of product.  </li>
<li> My hair was almost dead and this makes it shinning again!</li>
<li> But honestly, it&#x27;s no match for L&#x27;Oreal force vector.&lt;br</li>
<li> It may seem expensive but</li>
<li> The straightening serum is weird.  </li>
<li> isn&#x27;t a bad product by any means, and I plan on passing it along to a friend.</li>

    <li> Does not do what it claims to do, my hair is curly but not to curly but it did not take the frizz out of my hair or straighten it at all big lie</li>
    <li> Great quality and great price! Deilvered on time as always</li>
    <li> Prices on theseroducts can vary so I was happy to find all 3 at what is normally the price of just shampoo.</li>

    <li> I did not notice any wonderful results from using this product.  I actually didn&#x27;t notice any results at all. No different that using a regular drug store shampoo.. I have tossed this in the trash and will stick with my Nexxus..</li>
    <li> Great products, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Was pleased with the results worked better than I anticipated and keeps frizz away. Will use again in the future.</li>

    <li> I love this product &amp; it shipped really quickly.</li>
    <li> Great just like the ones I bought at the salon three for the price of one!</li>
    <li> This is NOT a kit to do a blowout. It is just a maintenance kit for after you get a blowout done. I easily got a return no problem. Vendor was easy to work with.</li>
    <li> definately cant beat the price. exactly what i buy at l</li>
    <li> After I get my hair done i noticed that my hair was always silkier longer than when I washed it at home with my other high end products (Redken,Pravana etc.). I saw that my stylist had this product on her back bar so I ordered it for home use. Yep now my hair is silkier longer when I do it at home too.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go without these if you get Brazilian blowouts.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. A+A+A+</li>
    <li> They are really great!</li>
    <li> It is amazing product my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> I have a brazillian blowout and have not found anything else that makes my hair straight and shiney. The products really help to keep it that way. It may seem expensive but when you have course surly hair like mine and finally find somehting that works, you don&#x27;t care about a few extra $. Beauty isn&#x27;t cheap! Bonus, the smell great.I not only get compliments on how my hair looks, but also how great it smells.</li>
    <li> I recently had a Brazilian blowout done and I love it! My stylist said this kit is a must to maintain your treated hair. So far it&#x27;s doing a great job. The price was great too!</li>
    <li> Good price and product seems to work just as well as the one I bought for $65 each in the salon.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> Product came early and is exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price</li>
    <li> My favorite product for my naturally curly hair!  Yes, I use it on my curly hair to provide extra conditioning and keep the frizzy down.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with my curl and I have received compliments asking if I have gotten a new cut.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> its a great product with my brazilian blow out. I would highly recommend this product to any one who has the Brazilian blowout treatment.</li>
    <li> *Almost* everything you need to maintain a perfect Brazilian blowout. I just wish it came with the hair mask, too - I had to buy that separately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, but this product gunked my hair up &amp; made it very heavy. Had to go thru a couple of washings to get it all out. The seller, however, was very gracious &amp; allowed me to return for a refund</li>
    <li> Is really good ,Amazing  I love it best thing that I try , I really see the different in my hair</li>
    <li> My hair is always so soft and straight after using the BBK. Its my favorite and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I live in georgia where it is very humid.  I have extremely fine shoulder legnth very curly hair ...I can get my hair silky straight, I need products to hold the style &amp; keep it straight. Within minutes of being exposed to the slightest humidity I look like a homeless person.</li>
    <li> The real deal and cheaper than at local salons.</li>
    <li> you have to have this if you have a Brazilian blowout</li>
    <li> Received when expected.</li>
    <li> great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> It would be five but I don&#x27;t like the way the balm leaves my hair. I have really damage hair do to bleaching. The shampoo and conditioner I love love love. Paired with a little bit of the masque.</li>
    <li> These are the products my stylist recommended to use after my Brazilian blowout to help lengthen the life of the blowout. Shipped quickly, Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I would like to know where and how this retailer purchased this product. I&#x27;m not sure this is even the real product as you cannot even buy it for that cost as a hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a professional I don&#x27;t want to support Companies that sell to Amazon distributors.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be an awesome shampoo/conditioner/balm. It&#x27;s ok, I guess. It smells awesome, and it did the bare minimum of what I expected. But honestly, it&#x27;s no match for L&#x27;Oreal force vector.&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt dry after using this &amp; it was really unruly.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair - I have long, thin hair that is difficult at best.
