    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend that use to work at a salon! The reviews on the product looked great and with her recommendation I decided to give it a try! Product arrived right on time as expected &amp; I have to say that this product is pretty amazing I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it made my hair I used the product Monday night and it&#x27;s now Wednesday morning and my hair is still silky smooth I love it!!! Comparing how my hair naturally air dries (vs. using a blowdryer) with this product vs. using my regular shampoo/conditioner I was really amazed with the significant difference! The way I applied it was I put on the product and then put a cap over it and then used the blow dryer to put some heat on it ever few mins. My friend made a point that, that&#x27;s how they do it in the salon so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to put some heat on it.  I also left it on for about 15 mins. Def. highly recommend this product!</li>
