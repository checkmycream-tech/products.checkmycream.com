    <li> these are not what i was expecting.  more detail in the description would have been useful.  these can be fun if you are willing to put in the effort required to cut them</li>
    <li> Reason for my 3 star rating is because i only got 11 rolls and 2 of them looked very similar, but they are okay for a starter like me.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly. Do not waste time and money</li>
    <li> because this is something I have been wanting for and now had the money so that mean things I to don&#x27;t have just the same ideas to work to work or designs d</li>
    <li> I love it u soooooo beautiful better the what I expect easy to applied when you follow directions I will buy it millions time</li>
    <li> Dissapointed, no the designs shown in picture.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get design to stick on nail, even with proper tools. I feel like this is a waste. Although they are cute.</li>
    <li> Did not work or do as promised no matter what bonder product I used.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors and the different prints, I am ordering another one for my co-worker. These are AWESOME!!! I am so happy, I ordered, not disappointed at all. Great deal for the price, I did check other places and amazon has the better deal!</li>
    <li> Oh how I have been waiting to use these.  I love each on of them. I get complimnets everytime I use them.  People think I painted my nails with the designs.  Only if they knew it was foil.  And they came on time.</li>
    <li> Good product, no duplicates! One roll was much shorter than the others, by at least a foot. They work well with foil glue, are easy to apply and can be used for crafts as well as nail art.</li>
    <li> I just got around to using this and this is not the transfer film that&#x27;s used for nails. Cute designs but this is not for nails.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product i thought they were gone be like the picture liked like but wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and I got 3 silver of the same design and 2 gold of the same design I di not get 12 different  designs I got all solid colors</li>
    <li> The nail foils I received today were awful.  It looked like I got the floor sweepings from a nail foil factory.  Out of 12 foils only 5 were usable.  The others were creased or wadded up in the container.  One of them was an obvious end peice (was half the width of all the others and half of that wasn&#x27;t usable as the backing was gone).  I will never order this product or ANY product from this seller again.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> info on how to use this would of been helpful..</li>
    <li> I am writing a review for this, only because this is not what I was expecting at all. First off, they were all regular colors, except ONE. It says random patterns would be chosen, but I was not expecting them to be all regular colors and one pattern. That&#x27;s deceitful. They need to put that in the description. Also, as I opened up the bottles, I was surprised to see that the rolls were so scratched up, that the patterns were ruined. If this wasn&#x27;t as cheap as it was, both in price and quality, I&#x27;d send it back. Back seeing as it took a month to get to me, I won&#x27;t bother. Don&#x27;t expect to much from this product. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the color selection, but was hoping the roll would be a little longer. It will still last me a while.</li>
    <li> Nice variety, no instructions.  Not all foils transfer onto gel nails</li>
    <li> Nice variety in this selection. Much more vibrant in person... can&#x27;t wait to test them out.</li>
    <li> I like them but I thought it was the color on the picture an they weren&#x27;t and 1 of them we scratch. But they were okay I guess</li>
    <li> Liked 3 out of 12 the mix was not the best. Needed just the 3. But had to buy all of them because they don&#x27;t seem to let u choose what you like.</li>
    <li> Love these. They work great.</li>
    <li> Dnt waste ur money !!!!! I use these on two of my friends nail and the next day it was off , so mad ur now .</li>
