<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As I am this is my first time of using it, and my hair like it a lot. Is so soft</li>
    <li> very good product, uses it daily. has done wonders for my afro</li>
    <li> I use this on my grandbaby&#x27;s hair and it moistens it and detangles it.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it seems to have a sour milk smell sometimes.</li>
    <li> I thought the moisture would last throughout the day. I now use a product that does. If you&#x27;re looking for moisture and shine, this not the product for you.</li>
    <li> Another great hair product.  I have combination west Indian hair and used aparingly, it does not cause a &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; feeling to the hair.  It is a tad greasy so don&#x27;t use too much.  :)</li>
    <li> best curly 3b hair products!  not sticky, no flaking, and curly girl safe!  Fragrance diminished once dry.  GREAT PRODUCT LINE</li>
    <li> I spend a lot on these products As I Am .. An No Is Not As I Expected .. Did not work for me at all .&lt;br /&gt;Honestly your hair feels and look dry . Yet dripping with oil and feels course when you leather with these products&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I suggest buying more than one product from this series....great product but works extremely well when in conjunction with shampoo and conditioner and moisturizer....</li>
    <li> Moisture milk did not add sheen or moisture to my hair. After applying the product, my hair became stiff and unmanageable. My hair still looked dry. Because it is pricey, I will finish the bottle but I will not purchase this product again. I have not seen any benefit so I do not recommend this product. I like other As I Am products such as the cleansing pudding and hydration elation conditioner.</li>
    <li> Pure moisture for your here</li>
    <li> Product does not do what it is selling to do, I already submitted FEEDBACK on this item.</li>
    <li> Tried to make it work; had to take it back. Read whatever I could find on how I might be using it wrong. It took away any curl definition that my hair naturally would have had. Had to give up and go to work today with my hair looking like dry, straight hair. Worse than I&#x27;d ever normally go out with, but I had no choice. I&#x27;ll go back to using Shea Moisture. Their Restorative Elixir with the Curl and Style Milk beats this.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the As I Am curling jelly. It didn&#x27;t dry crunchy, but it was soft and light.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel greasy, and it did nothing to soften my hair. The same goes for the double butter.</li>
    <li> I Love the product my hair is very short and very coarse and it doesa my hair great justice i would recommend at the product to any siter that is wearing their hair natural</li>
    <li> I love this product! I Love this product!! I LOVE this product!!!  I have finally found a staple product and am nearing the end of PJ days.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that truly moisturizes my hair and leaves it feeling soft &amp; shiny.  I have 4 a/b type hair and I&#x27;ve had porosity issues in the past which have thankfully been fixed and this has helped keep my moisture and aid in my the growth and health of my hair.  A friend of mine swears by AIA double butter but it did nothing for my hair so she shared sample of this moisture milk and I have been hooked ever since!! I use it to moisturize every other day, I spray my hair with my liquid leave in spray and then I apply this milk and seal with an oil or butter and my hair stays moisturized! I love it and will be making this a staple product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Thanks for making this product! It is a good moisturizer for hair, provides good coverage and protection for the hair.</li>
    <li> The whole family uses this for daily hair use. I  will continue to use and purchase this item. lower the price though</li>
    <li> It really made my hair greasy. Lessening the amount only left part of my hair covered. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I like this on as well.  I used this on my hair and it made my hair soft and manageable.  there was still some moisture the next day morning when i removed the twists. I think the combination of this with the as i am leave in conditioner. this smells great too. its pricey i will catch the sale for this as well. I was a bit suprised due to all the negative comments about this product and that my hair does not like the shea moisture milks.  To each his own, i guess.</li>
    <li> My hair was dry and brittle after using this product. It also took away any curl definition I had. I had my hair straightened (not chemically) after using this product. Wish I could give it 0 stars.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have tight 4C hair and I use this in conjunction with Kinky Curly.  Gives my hair more shine and curl definition.  This is now my mainstay product!</li>
    <li> As this product is great, I found myself having to use too much of it and for the price that this little bottle was I simply can&#x27;t afford it.  I love the co-wash product and will continue to purchasing that but this product will not be purchased again.</li>
    <li> I did NOT like this product AT ALL.  I am 3c/4a and currently transitioning and, while I realize that most As I Am products are geared towards true naturals, I DO use (and LOVE, LOVE LOVE) the Coconut Cowash as well as the Hydration Elation and can&#x27;t say enough either of those products.  So, wanting to stay in the same line, I decided to try the As I Am Moisture Milk.  Boy did I ever regret that choice.  I SO wanted this milk to work as a daily moisturizer but much to my surprise it just left my hair a waxy, greasy mess.  I really wanted this to work at least as good as my current &#x27;milk&#x27; but unfortunately, it did nothing of the sort.  Every time I touched my hair I felt like I needed to wash the waxy grease off my hands.  I will say this though...  I chose NOT to wash my hair again but instead I curled it with some low heat electric curlers and it held up just fine in 95 degree weather.  Nonetheless, I returned the Milk because I couldn&#x27;t see myself ever wanting to use this product again.  Perhaps it works better of a different hair type...?</li>
    <li> so far i do like this product. would like to use a few of the As I Am products, but some of them are expensive.</li>
