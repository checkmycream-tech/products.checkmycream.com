      <li>This is one of my favorite palettes.  </li>
      <li>I love how pigmented it is</li>
      <li>But they look much better on the palette than they do on my eyes.</li>
      <li>Eyeshadow goes on smoothly, eyeliner goes on like silk!</li>
      <li>Love the colors</li>
      <li>The colour palette is beautiful with a nice mix of glitter shadow with the regular shadows.  </li>
      <li>I looked super sexy with my eyeshadow!</li>
      <li>Bought it for my stepmom but loved it so much</li>
      <li>colours with glitter are best applied wet!</li>
      <li>Colors are amazing, pigment is intense and lasts all day!</li>
      <li>The case itself is very pretty too!  </li>
      <li>Huge fan.  </li>
      <li>Smooth as butter when applying.  </li>
      <li>The eyeliner is great as well - glides on effortlessly and even does well on the upper and lower waterlines.</li>
      <li>All of the shadows are almost ridiculously smooth and pigmented, with sparkle that doesn&#x27;t fall out all over the place.  </li>
      <li>I received the &amp;#34;Chocolate Bar&amp;#34; version of this product as a gift and liked it so much that I purchased two of these Palettes for friends.  </li>
      <li>The colors are fabulous and it stays on all day</li>
      <li>AND THEY ALL GO ON SMOOTH</li>
      <li>This palette is pure perfection in a box for someone who likes sparkle, and it quickly became one of my all time favorite palettes!  </li>
      <li>the containers are all pretty interesting.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive this item.</li>
      <li>Fun easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love the pencil that comes with this, very soft and easy on the lids.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
      <li>We celebrated Christmas over the Thanksgiving weekend.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>The looks you can achieve are endless which is great.</li>
      <li>I started using this, following the included suggestion cards, and my eyes have never looked better!  </li>
      <li>So far my favorite palette.</li>
      <li>can use some of the colors.very high shimmers.i will probably give this to my niece .she will enjoy them.</li>
      <li>Girlfriend said it has good pigment, long lasting and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Collection\\&quot; because the colors are great in that one too but they all don&#x27;t go on great, some I needed primer and liquiset for (BOTH) and as a makeup artist that is really annoying when the colors won&#x27;t &#x27;pop&#x27;</li>
      <li>Overall the colors are great and I like the cards that help with different ways to apply.</li>
      <li>You can mix different shades and the price is worth the many colors you have in the palette.</li>
      <li>The colors blend easily, and the little included makeup cards suggest six very easy but beautiful looks which have gotten me many compliments :)  Even though it is so sparkly, it is possible to create very wearable looks with this palette, and in fact this is what I use when I am in a rush to get to work and have only a few minutes to do my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I could spend hours playing with this toy;)</li>
      <li>Make sure to use an eye shadow primer if you want the colors to last.</li>
      <li>too funny.</li>
      <li>Also because of the colors being so saturated this palette will last longer than most.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it and would definitely repurchase.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the colors but I wish the colors were labeled inside and not on the bottom of the case.</li>
    <li> Gift, she loved it..loved the colors..little pricey but nice.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic color palette, and the &amp;#34;shadow insurance&amp;#34; makes it so that I only have to apply the one time! I love Too Faced products.</li>
    <li> I hate traveling with lots of little compacts. This is great because it has it all in one case.</li>
    <li> Like my title says 37 dollars for makeup? Are you kidding me?! It made my girlfriend happy so really that&#x27;s all that matters though. Happy girlfriend happy life.</li>
    <li> it was so nice and the box crispy! thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Perfect for all occasions, and lots of choices. Love this pallete and the look book has some great ideas.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors.but to sexy for me.i can use some of the colors.very high shimmers.i will probably give this to my niece .she will enjoy them.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and the texture is fabulous</li>
    <li> This palette is amazing. This was my first Too Faced purchase, and after using this I immediately went hunting for other palettes. I adore shimmery colors, and a smoky-eyed look. So this is nearly the perfect palette for me. The colors are highly pigmented, last quite awhile with the mini-primer you get, and the cards teach you how to go from day-night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve used every single look, and even use this palette with other looks/palettes. Especially the golds/brown and iridescent vanilla shade. I think that&#x27;s my favorite look of this palette.</li>
    <li> Powdery, colors not as vibrant on the lid and LOTS of glitter fallout. Can only use for parties</li>
    <li> But they look much better on the palette than they do on my eyes. I love the pencil that comes with this, very soft and easy on the lids. Make sure to use an eye shadow primer if you want the colors to last. The little booklet cleverly stashed behind the mirror has excellent tips and instructions on how to use it. I could spend hours playing with this toy;)</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  One of my very favorite pallettes, and I am an eyeshadow junkie!&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret this purchase.  Colors are amazing, pigment is intense and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my stepmom but loved it so much I kept it for myself. Love the eyeliner it comes with and it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I received the &amp;#34;Chocolate Bar&amp;#34; version of this product as a gift and liked it so much that I purchased two of these Palettes for friends.  I got a GREAT deal from this seller on Amazon and it&#x27;s pretty difficult to find discounts on this brand.  Love the richness of color and the containers are all pretty interesting.  I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this palette! Great diversity of colors and looks that are sure to go with any outfit/occasion. Colors are highly pigmented and are shimmery, not glittery, if that makes sense. Like another reviewer stated, it comes with 3 direction inserts that show you how to create a \\&quot;Daytime\\&quot; and \\&quot;Night\\&quot; look for each palette. The eyeliner is great as well - glides on effortlessly and even does well on the upper and lower waterlines. Love the eye primer, too! All in all, great set!</li>
    <li> Fabulous!  excellent price, well packages and fast shipping.  Thank you, it is beautiful!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the color saturation...but it does leave a mess on my face at times. Usually have to wipe off color dust on my face after applying.</li>
    <li> I received my order before the estimated arrival date and in a wonderful condition.  The color palette is awesome and very versatile.  You can create so many looks with the colors provided! The price is just a plus! I couldn&#x27;t find this palette cheaper anywhere. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The fall out from this pallet is HORRIBLE!! I kept thinking it must be fake. but nope. Compared to the one in Sephora its the real deal. I literally have to put my shadow on bent over the sink to avoid getting glitter all over my face. I almost want to throw it away but I spent $50 on it so im just going to try and make the best of it..</li>
    <li> Saw it at Sephora, bought it on amazon because I had a gift card.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing. i really love it. i&#x27;ve only dipped into the brown shades for now.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: very pigmented...and glittery. Swatch before you apply!&lt;br /&gt;These shades are a lot more playful than something you&#x27;d find in a NAKED or NAKED2 palette.&lt;br /&gt;It is not for everyday use I don&#x27;t think, but by the time the night comes and your work day is over,&lt;br /&gt;this is the palette to get you in the happy hour mood :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one of the colors in this palette is called the 7 year itch. too funny.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite palettes.  I like how the shadows are represented  as you can use them as three different sets or you can mix and match colors. The looks you can achieve are endless which is great. The eye liner it comes with is very nice too. Will last me the whole day with no smearing or fading. Wished it would have came with a double ended application brush too but I won&#x27;t be greedy.  This is a great palette if you like shimmery shadows. If you only like mattes, then you will not appreciate this palette.  I LOVE it and would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this palette because of the smoky colors I was trying to achieve. I love how pigmented it is and you only need a little bit on your brush to achieve the colors you want. Last a long time. I can wear during the day and at night! So far my favorite palette.</li>
    <li> Great color options for the price and the eye pencil is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  The colour palette is beautiful with a nice mix of glitter shadow with the regular shadows.  The instruction cards are fun to use in order to give yourself that extra glam for evenings.  The shadows themselves apply and blend easily, and, by using the small tube of eye lid foundation that is included in the box, they stay on for hours with no creasing.  The case itself is very pretty too!  I love mine so much that I&#x27;ve also ordered the Too Faced Naked Eye Palette.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Love this eye shadow.  The colors are fabulous and it stays on all day</li>
    <li> Eyeshadow goes on smoothly, eyeliner goes on like silk! Eye shadow primer keeps it on all day long, no touch ups needed...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend getting makeup in the mail. The powder was slightly &amp;#34;cracked&amp;#34; and over a very short period of time the entire color crumbled. I didn&#x27;t try to get a refund so perhaps Amazon would replace it. I just have decided that shipping makeup may not be for me.</li>
    <li> I looked super sexy with my eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> Huge fan.  Great prompt service. Fun easy to use.</li>
    <li> We celebrated Christmas over the Thanksgiving weekend.&lt;br /&gt;The eye shadow was a gift for my daughter-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;She had never seen the 3 sets together and was thrilled&lt;br /&gt;to have so many options.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this palette and I am so glad I did.This palette is absolutely beautiful,from the gorgeous eyeshadow colors,wonderful and might I add lasting,eyeliner,right down to the glamourous and sturdy packaging.The eyeshadow colors are very saturated and they show up without having to be heavy-handed with the shadow brush,a little goes a long way.Also because of the colors being so saturated this palette will last longer than most.I like the lay-out of the palette also.Its like three mini-palettes in one container.First you have the shimmery browns/golds/creams,then you have the shimmery purples/pinks,and lastly you have the smokey grays/blacks.Every color in this palette has a shimmer to it so your eye area is beautifully highlighted.The eyeliner in this palette is larger-sized and amazing.It is saturated and lasting just like the eyeshadows.I recently had to go out of state for a family occasion and I put my eye make-up on,the eyeliner and the smokey/grays/blacks,at 10:00 a.m and I had it on till nearly midnight and it lasted!I have been using this kit every single day since I got it. This was only my second purchase from the Too Faced line but this product sold me.I will most definately be purchasing more Too Faced Cosmetics.Awesome quality of products!</li>
    <li> I wanted a compact eye shadow kit for my mobile make up purse. What i got instead was too big, and all the colours look like i party all day everyday. I&#x27;d like the colors if they had significantly less glitter. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I was so excited but now disappointed because they didt wrap it very well they only put it in yallow envelope and send it to me when i received it its was totally broken</li>
    <li> This palette is pure perfection in a box for someone who likes sparkle, and it quickly became one of my all time favorite palettes!  All of the shadows are almost ridiculously smooth and pigmented, with sparkle that doesn&#x27;t fall out all over the place.  The colors blend easily, and the little included makeup cards suggest six very easy but beautiful looks which have gotten me many compliments :)  Even though it is so sparkly, it is possible to create very wearable looks with this palette, and in fact this is what I use when I am in a rush to get to work and have only a few minutes to do my makeup.  And let&#x27;s not forget the eyeliner...rich and creamy, and yet it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super-sensitive eyes.  It has dethroned my favorite black liner from Urban Decay, it&#x27;s just that amazing.  This palette was my first purchase from Too Faced, and I must say I am very, very impressed!</li>
    <li> Love Too Faced products.  Smooth as butter when applying.  I use with their eyeshadow primer also.</li>
    <li> Beautiful palette!!  You can mix different shades and the price is worth the many colors you have in the palette.</li>
    <li> The colors are great, but there is quite a bit of gliter in some of the colors, I like more of a glimmer effect. Overall the colors are great and I like the cards that help with different ways to apply.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome eye shadow  palette, the color combinations are beautiful and rich.&lt;br /&gt;One of my new favorites,  even though they&#x27;re all shimmery they still work day or night.&lt;br /&gt;This seller is awesome too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this palette. I started using this, following the included suggestion cards, and my eyes have never looked better!  The base is a miracle worker. I used to always have my eyeshadow caked in my crease after an hour. Made me crazy. Not any more!  Even family noticed the new eyeshadow. I&#x27;m just amazed. Amazed and ashamed for not doing this sooner. I can&#x27;t wait to get my next palette and play.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this item. When I opened it a few of the colors were broken into pieces.  So disappointing.  The colors look pretty and it seems like a nice quality eye shadow, but it&#x27;s crumbled.  :(</li>
    <li> i love the colours in this pallete. I used this for my engagement photoshoot. it was great. colours with glitter are best applied wet! beats getting glitter all over the place! the colours are very pigmented. great buy.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend said it has good pigment, long lasting and easy to apply.  She was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> love the pigment but wish there were matte shades in the palette. Seller was great!</li>
    <li> Love this pallet! A bit more expensive than I&#x27;m used to but it goes on flawlessly! The tube of eye primer it comes with is also amazing!! Definitely recommend &amp; will be purchasing another!!</li>
    <li> This was a HUGE happy surprise as I was not impressed with my other TOO FACED Palette - the \\&quot;Natural Eye Neutral Eye Shadow Collection\\&quot; because the colors are great in that one too but they all don&#x27;t go on great, some I needed primer and liquiset for (BOTH) and as a makeup artist that is really annoying when the colors won&#x27;t &#x27;pop&#x27; easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyhoo, this collection is MUCH BETTER! GREAT COLORS AND THEY ALL GO ON SMOOTH&lt;br /&gt;YES!</li>
