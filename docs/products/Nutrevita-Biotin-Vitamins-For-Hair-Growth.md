<li> I have been trying to grow my hair for a while, and have problems with dry hair and breakage.</li>

<li> so I have to break them in half  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve seen a lot less coming out when I comb it.</li>
<li> The pills in the bottle are of typical supplement size.  </li>

<li> The first thing to start going bad is my nails.</li>
<li> The only reason this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it&#x27;s so inconvenient to take - can&#x27;t take within an hour of other meds and must take with food.</li>
<li> and I had a hard time swallowing it because I kept choking.  </li>
<li> so I take that to mean they are working.  </li>
<li> and my hair is now on the of my sholders in the back,and past my ear in the front and sides!!</li>
<li> I was very skeptical of taking this since I&#x27;ve always taken biotin and honestly never saw a difference.</li>
<li> i was growing my hair out and had an unfortunate hair color event to where i had to cut 2.5 inches off.</li>
<li> The pills are on the larger side, but do not leave a nasty after taste on your tongue, and do not upset your stomach.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Biotin? I know I do. So does my hair, skin, and nails. And I do know a low quality product when I take it. The first thing to start going bad is my nails. After switching to these hair growth vitamins, within 3 days I noticed that my hair was feeling softer, and looking more sleek. Which told me that my original Biotin wasn&#x27;t a very good quality. And I thought it was. A month in to this bottle, and I am LOVING the results. The pills are on the larger side, but do not leave a nasty after taste on your tongue, and do not upset your stomach. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these for a few days now and I can tell a difference in my hair. My hair is softer and feels stronger. These have given me some great results. If you want to grow your hair out, these are perfect for you.</li>
    <li> So I have been getting some thinned out hair and have been looking for anything to help and I found this and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I have been taking it for a good while now and it took a little time but  my hair is actually thicker than when I started.  It&#x27;s not back to one hundred percent yet but definetly fifty percent better.  The pills them self were easy for me to take with no after taste.  I will be buying another bottle since it has worked so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I received this product  at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help my hair grow, I choose Nutrevita because of the positive reviews,GLAD I did with in three weeks I could see growth, have ordered 3 bottles now and my hair is now on the of my sholders in the back,and past my ear in the front and sides!!</li>
    <li> Did not work as the reviews said, if i could get my money back i would .</li>
    <li> excellent product, my hair is growing faster than it has before in the past and my nais are growing fast and stronger great prodct!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of taking this since I&#x27;ve always taken biotin and honestly never saw a difference. i was growing my hair out and had an unfortunate hair color event to where i had to cut 2.5 inches off. and if your growing your hair out you know how bad of a hit that is LOL anyway make long story short. i took this as DIRECTED. and its been about 3 weeks now and i swear my hair is growing like weeds. i ordered my second bottle before even being done with this one completely (almost done with it though) this is a great product honestly and best of all IT WORKS! at this rate i really think i&#x27;ll have my hair as long as i want it by summer!  this didn&#x27;t affect my skin in any negative way, my nails did start growing a bit faster for sure. best of luck i hope this helps!</li>
    <li> The pills are very big and I had a hard time swallowing it because I kept choking.  So I stopped.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> while it contains iron and biotin, this stuff can&#x27;t hurt. But it did not do anything for me.</li>
    <li> It was ok. My hair grew a Lil but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again for this price.</li>
    <li> Sooo far soo good.... im on my second bottle...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference in my hair. It&#x27;s been two weeks since I have been taking this product and the only thing I have noticed is that I have experienced diarrhea once or twice if I haven&#x27;t eaten or drunk enough water with the pills but other than that nothing really happened when I took them.</li>
    <li> Not as I expected ...!</li>
    <li> GREAT HAIR VITAMINS LOADED WITH THE NECESSARY B VITAMINS....</li>
    <li> My hair has become fuller and healthier since using this vitamin.  I am happy with the results.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I received mine and to me the pills are to big to take so I have to break them in half  I think they should make them smaller. So far they are working for me  thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair grow so fast!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to grow my hair for a while, and have problems with dry hair and breakage. I tried this and noticed less breakage and more luster, even after blow drying and flat ironing my hair. I even notice less hair loss after washing! This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Kind of a big pill, but no bad taste, and actually not hard to swallow. My hair and skin look great after using these for a month or so now. I feel comfortable with the quality of this brand and would recommend it to my friends. Great price too for how many pills you get!</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t seen much change and I am about half way threw the bottle but I feel so much better so I hope for the best!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for hair loss and I hope they get it back in stock and if they don&#x27;t I will find it somewhere because it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me and i&#x27;m someone with a tyroid condition.</li>
    <li> Got it for my 47 year old girlfriend who is worried she might end up looking more like me than she&#x27;s comfortable with. So far she has commented on some itching and a slowing of loss. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I believe it&#x27;s a good product and it&#x27;s packed full of vitamins, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t show improvement for my thin hair after a month of using.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my hair. I was depressed and my hair started to fall out in clumps. I got this with a coupon code so I was trying this out and it worked out on me. I didn&#x27;t have any side effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 months and I can see a difference in the thickness and length of my hair. I have pretty thin hair and I noticed that the strands of new growth, near the root, are thicker and my hair is more dense. The new growth is also healthier, shinier, and I believe its stronger. These pills don&#x27;t have a weird taste or smell and they don&#x27;t make me feel funny afterwards, I feel normal. I would definitely recommend these pills for hair growth to anyone.</li>
    <li> For the last three years my hair has been thinning and falling out.  I have NO idea why.  Even after several doctor&#x27;s visits I still have no real answers.  While I am waiting I have been trying supplements to see if I can find anything that will help. I have been taking these supplements over the last week and I have noticed the amount of hair I am losing has slowed down.  At this point I will take what I can get!  LOL  I will keep taking these and see if he helps with new hair growth.  The pills in the bottle are of typical supplement size.  I took a picture of the pill on a penny for scale.  The pills are not really thick thankfully making them easier to swallow.  There is no coating on the pill.  They smell like vitamins. They are not great on the tongue or taste wise but very doable.  The pills at least do not trigger my super gag reflex thankfully!  So far these seem to be slowing my hair loss so I take that to mean they are working.  Hopefully I will regrow some of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received this product at a discount to be able to try the product out and give my honest feedback on the product.</li>
    <li> Helped battle hair loss and made my hair very soft and shiny. Totally did not expect that! Pills were easy to swallow and did not upset my tummy at all, even when taken without food.</li>
    <li> Since starting this I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is shinier and I&#x27;ve seen a lot less coming out when I comb it. The only reason this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it&#x27;s so inconvenient to take - can&#x27;t take within an hour of other meds and must take with food.</li>
    <li> so far so good! i can see shiny hair!</li>
    <li> really makes a difference</li>
