      <li>This cream works for anyone trying to keep their skin looking fresh and young.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the difference between the two.</li>
      <li>I feel like it didn&#x27;t do anything too much for my eyes, in fact, i feel as though it sometimes dries out</li>
      <li>It also moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>I dot a bit of treatment under each eye and let the formula absorb into my skin as I get ready for work.  </li>

      <li>I will be sending it back right away.</li>
      <li>a few days fter, wrinkles are much less, a very effective cream.</li>
      <li>Having used the Avon Clinical Duo Eye System for several years it was alarming that the results weren&#x27;t as satisfying as Time went on, hence I chose this newer eye treatment from the Genics line</li>
      <li>I was VERY surprised at how well this worked.  </li>
      <li>This product really helped the dark circles under my eyes and the laugh wrinkles at the corners...</li>
      <li>I will continue to use and recommend to anyone who needs a deep yet gentle lid/eye area moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have used the product for about a month, and since I didn&#x27;t take before and after photos, I really can&#x27;t tell a visual difference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old, I might not have wrinkles yet</li>
      <li>i am 58, and have T-zone and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my skin and it has no harsh smell to it.</li>
      <li>I had a few different girls in my office give me their opinion to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me.  </li>
      <li>I can have a late night out and on barely any sleep and still look fresh as a daisy thanks to this.</li>
      <li>(I am a 46 year old female).  </li>
      <li>I am constantly getting  compliments about how young my skin is.</li>
      <li>, those lines mean that Grandma has had a full life of laughter and tears&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon I can get this for half the price.</li>

<li> Thanks Amazon I can get this for half the price.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s improved from slight crepe-iness and droop to snug, smooth closer to late &#x27;30&#x27;s than cruising mid-50&#x27;s.</li>
<li> I have noticed the under eye dark circles lightening up with the first few applications.</li>
<li> It came earlier than expected which is a bonus.</li>
<li> I have used it for a long time.</li>
<li> i am truly amazed and stopped using all other eye creams i recently bought.  </li>
<li> I used it twice for like two days but only once a day after that because I forget and do other things</li>
<li> I had horribly dry eyelids to the point that they were chapping and peeling (I had no idea</li>
<li> only bummer is I&#x27;ll need to alternate the Genics and the Clinical monthly so as not to waste that already opened product</li>
<li> The moderately deep wrinkles under my eye started to look less set in.  </li>
<li> Not much to say except that</li>
<li> However at the age of 60, I am wondering if slipping into grandmother-hood needs to look so saggy.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with dark circles, so can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
<li> I stopped applying the cream in the mornings because it lays on the skin for a while and is not absorbed immediately.</li>
<li> while it has lightened the dark circles, it hasn&#x27;t helped with the crows feet.  </li>
<li> I am about to hit 40 and have some slight sag under the eyes,</li>
<li> I tried typical lotion and anything I could find.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this cream for a couple of years now.  I love the Anew product line ad use it daily.</li>
    <li> I can def. see the results a few days fter, wrinkles are much less, a very effective cream. It also moisturizes very well.</li>
    <li> Hate it.  I have used this for a few years through Avon directly and loved it.  I ordered one other time from amazon that I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was exactly the same but I liked it.  This one I just got is awful and I will in no way put it on my eyes!!!  I don&#x27;t know if it is a counterfeit, bad batch or just old.  It smells completely different and when I put it on my hand it stung.  I had a few different girls in my office give me their opinion to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me.  It is definitely not the same.  I will be sending it back right away.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye cream</li>
    <li> I can not believe what this cream has done for my face/eye area. I can have a late night out and on barely any sleep and still look fresh as a daisy thanks to this. This has renewed my entire eye area and makes me look 5 years younger! I am still in shock by how well this cream works. I highly, very highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizes the eye area nicely</li>
    <li> Smells like oil of Olay my mother used. I don&#x27;t think it helped at all. I used an Avon eye product before that was great but they don&#x27;t make it anymore. I use this on my feet now cause I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I was VERY surprised at how well this worked.  I have used for just three days and nights and am really impressed!  I am about to hit 40 and have some slight sag under the eyes, some fine lines and this has really restored hydration and lift to the skin.  I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hope, but bought based on other reviews and am very glad I did.  Great product and excellent price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye cream and I have tried several from Avon.  I have been using this for 2 years and this is the fastest way to get it with free shipping from my Amazon Prime.  The eye cream is not greasy and is absorbed very quickly.  I find it works great for under eye wrinkles and keeping crows feet away.  I am 50 and have very few lines around my eyes and I think this eye cream has helped keep them away.  I have tried to find less expensive options but always come back to this-</li>
    <li> great product, arrived on time</li>
    <li> Nice, rich cream, that blends in well, no stickyness after a minute ot two :-) Nice scent and texture. I like it!</li>
    <li> This is my go-to eye cream in the morning.  I dot a bit of treatment under each eye and let the formula absorb into my skin as I get ready for work.  It really helps to diminish under-eye darkness and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This product really helped the dark circles under my eyes and the laugh wrinkles at the corners...I can recommend with confidence. I am now trying the Anew Platinum to see if it is any better. I don&#x27;t really understand the difference between the two.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It has a little bit of caffeine in it to help reduce puffiness.  Great price too about 1/3 of what I paid through Avon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and like it.</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of eye creams, most costing 3-4 times what I paid for this.  None of them performed like this!  I actually can see a difference!  The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave little tiny white heads under my skin that won&#x27;t come out except with surgery! (clinique eye cream did this to me)  So I am guessing that there are better ingredients in this that won&#x27;t cause that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Avon products and used them for years.  Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of trying this one sooner.  I have ordered another to have on hand so that I can never run out!  Great find!  Thanks Amazon I can get this for half the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 months and I have found that the crepe-like wrinkles under my eyes have vastly diminished and the skin appears brighter.  I believe it has made me look more youthful (I am a 46 year old female).  I am very happy with this product and would likely re-order it.  It lasts a while since very little is needed for the area under the eyes.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is ultra rich, very luxurious - fine lines &amp; wrinkles are gone! I love this eye cream &amp; would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Always wonderful for your eyes the best product ever</li>
    <li> Product arrives on time and seems fresh and I have reordered several times.</li>
    <li> I love this product truly. It came earlier than expected which is a bonus. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while but saw results instantly! I had horribly dry eyelids to the point that they were chapping and peeling (I had no idea why). I tried typical lotion and anything I could find. I was desperately searching for months til I ordered this. The cream moisturized and softened my lids in just a few days. I used it twice for like two days but only once a day after that because I forget and do other things so I ended up putting it on after my shower before going to bed. This doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my skin and it has no harsh smell to it. I will continue to use and recommend to anyone who needs a deep yet gentle lid/eye area moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with the entire experience of this product from the shipping to actually seeing results.  Beauty products are very important to me and cost is a deciding factor so when I heard Avon had their Anew Genics for eyes I had to purchase this product through Amazon.com instead of using my Avon Lady (sorry but you can&#x27;t beat the price with Amazon).</li>
    <li> Softens the wrinkles &amp; creases around my eyes.  Doesn&#x27;t cause eye irritation.  Has a mild fragrance &amp; price range is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference.  Any cream if you use it everyday will help.  I&#x27;ve used tons of them.  You don&#x27;t need anything expensive.  This product doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t purchased much in the way of skin care before. However at the age of 60, I am wondering if slipping into grandmother-hood needs to look so saggy. I have used the product for about a month, and since I didn&#x27;t take before and after photos, I really can&#x27;t tell a visual difference. The cream IS Creamy, and putting something on my eyes at the very least makes me FEEL like I am doing something to regain my youth. Will I purchase it again? Maybe, or Maybe not. I probably should just accept the fact that when my grand daughter askes what those lines are....I should just say &amp;#34;Elaina, those lines mean that Grandma has had a full life of laughter and tears&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i have only used this for a week and the sunken area under my eye puffed back up.  The moderately deep wrinkles under my eye started to look less set in.  My eye lid started to look firmer.  i am truly amazed and stopped using all other eye creams i recently bought.  i am 58, and have T-zone and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, just what I was hoping for. Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this Avon Anew Genics eye treatment and noticed results with the first application. So I had to buy the product. I have noticed the under eye dark circles lightening up with the first few applications. And the cream is so creamy and great on wrinkled areas. I have tried many eye creams and nothing has compared to this cream and how quickly I have seen results.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream; leaves my eye skin moisturized and plump. Great for morning and night. I hate to wait 15 days to get my Avon order so this way I get it quicklier. Fantastic eye cream!</li>
    <li> Not much to say except that while it has lightened the dark circles, it hasn&#x27;t helped with the crows feet.  And my eye area still looks a little puffy and noticeable in the mornings.  I stopped applying the cream in the mornings because it lays on the skin for a while and is not absorbed immediately. I think I&#x27;ll give up trying to find an eye cream that works for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams and most do nothing. I&#x27;ve tried inexpensive, drugstore brands and high-end, pricey creams. Avon Anew eye treatment has visibly reduced the fine lines under my eyes. I don&#x27;t have a problem with dark circles, so can&#x27;t comment on that. After just two weeks I noticed a difference in the depth of the lines. I&#x27;m not claiming this is a miracle cream, but I did get results and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this several weeks now and love the results it&#x27;s achieved on my entire eye-area. It&#x27;s improved from slight crepe-iness and droop to snug, smooth closer to late &#x27;30&#x27;s than cruising mid-50&#x27;s. Having used the Avon Clinical Duo Eye System for several years it was alarming that the results weren&#x27;t as satisfying as Time went on, hence I chose this newer eye treatment from the Genics line and&#x27;ve been most satisfied with the results  : )&lt;br /&gt;The only bummer is I&#x27;ll need to alternate the Genics and the Clinical monthly so as not to waste that already opened product but one could say that&#x27;s a Good problem to have!</li>
    <li> I see no difference at all  😔😩</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old, I might not have wrinkles yet but there&#x27;s no reason why I shouldn&#x27;t take care of my face right. I get a lot of compliments from people my age and have been asked what I use for my skin/eyes especialy since i dont like using make-up. This cream works for anyone trying to keep their skin looking fresh and young.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used it for a long time. This website was the best price for it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for my eye area for quite some time now and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I am constantly getting  compliments about how young my skin is. No one believes I&#x27;m nearing 60!  It is amzing!</li>
    <li> Priduct was broken when I received it and no one want to the responsibility.  I just threw away my money.  I think Amazin should do right by me.</li>
    <li> I wear this eye cream both day &amp; night. One thing I like about it, is it doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets into my eyes.</li>
    <li> Most of my Avon products I have loved.  The texture, feel, and price are great.  This item is good, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I feel like it didn&#x27;t do anything too much for my eyes, in fact, i feel as though it sometimes dries out my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***it&#x27;s now towards the end of march and i&#x27;ve used this for about three months and still no noticeable difference. ths little jar does last a while; when it isn&#x27;t drying its a good moisturizer. would not repurchase however i do feel as though I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream, I use it every morning and every night. It has helped diminish my crows feet and under eye wrinkles alittle. Been using it for 2 months now, I would buy this again.</li>
