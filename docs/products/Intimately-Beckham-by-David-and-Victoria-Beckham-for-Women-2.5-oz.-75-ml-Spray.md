<li> It lasts a long time and is not overpowering.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not overpowering and can be worn at my office with a handful of scent sensitive folks without complaint.  </li>
<li> It takes quite a while on my skin for the base notes to warm up, and when they do, I&#x27;m not getting as heavy of a &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of them as I would like.  </li>
<li> I had previous purchased a travel size of this in a holiday sample pack from some retail store.  </li>
<li> I was a little nervous buying online and a cheaper price.</li>
<li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t find this perfume lasting very long on my skin at all</li>
<li> I have been using Beckham Signature for Women for the past few years and wanted a change.</li>
<li> Usually on my skin the base notes are what really have the staying power.  </li>
<li> The lack of a richer development of the base notes is the one disappointment I have about this whole blend.  </li>

    <li> Awesome fragrance.....lots of compliments</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume, hard to find was only available on amazon. Shipping was fast! Bottle looks bigger than the picture.</li>
    <li> Smells so awesome&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast delivery</li>
    <li> I purchased this, based on reviews I read about it, without having the opportunity to smell it first.  I am extremely happy!  This is some DELICIOUS juice!  When I spritz it on, I immediately get a heady dose of white flowers, rose, and tuberose. (I am one of those people who actually LOVE tuberose.) The initial group of flowers last for a while and then a light hint of lily joins the party. So luscious.  My nose never picks up the orange blossom or the bergamot.  It takes quite a while on my skin for the base notes to warm up, and when they do, I&#x27;m not getting as heavy of a &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of them as I would like.  I smell no sandalwood (which I love) and only a faint hint of musk and vanilla.  The lack of a richer development of the base notes is the one disappointment I have about this whole blend.  Usually on my skin the base notes are what really have the staying power.  Sadly, I don&#x27;t find this perfume lasting very long on my skin at all and I really wish it would.  It is such a truly beautiful scent I would love more time to enjoy it before it fades away.  Otherwise, in my opinion, this just couldn&#x27;t be better. Highly recommended - especially if you actually like tuberose like me!</li>
    <li> I had previous purchased a travel size of this in a holiday sample pack from some retail store.  I really like it.  It&#x27;s a little floral and clean smelling.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and can be worn at my office with a handful of scent sensitive folks without complaint.  This purchase was actually made in error.  I had it on my wish list, and purchased it, having forgotten that I recently purchased another travel size recently, so now I have can even leave home with it!</li>
    <li> I initially  purchased this for a friend who was very pleased with the gift and informed me what a nice and light fragrance it is. I then purchased it for myself and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product. It lasts a long time and is not overpowering. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  I used to buy this in stores but it went away.  I was a little nervous buying online and a cheaper price. But it arrived quickly.  It is exactly what I wanted at a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  It came very fast, packaged very well, and the real deal.  Can&#x27;t beat the savings. I&#x27;ll never pay full price again!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> So upset this is the only way I can find this perfume but I always buy two or three bottles at a time - my favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast shipment!</li>
    <li> When I first got this in the mail, there was a small dent on the corner of the box. however after opening it, bottle was completely unharmed and the fragrance is awesome! Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle for way less than I paid in store, same exact product and smells oh so heavenly :-) its my fave!</li>
    <li> my favorite scent. People stop me and complement me all the time , they always want to know the name of the fragrance.</li>

    <li> This is one of the most amazing fragrances ever. It has quickly become one of my favorite fragrances to wear. It is a soft, but sexy floral fragrance of rose petals, bergamot, orange blossom, tuberose, casablanca lily, sandalwood, vanilla, and musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely amazing.
