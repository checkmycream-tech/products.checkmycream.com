<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST SKIN CARE PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USE,LOVE IT</li>
    <li> NEPAL,  I  LOVE  YOU.  JUST  WHAT  I  WAS  LOOKING  FOR  BECAUSE  ITS  A  GEL,  LIGHT  AND  EASY  TO  REMOVE  AND  IAM  SICK  AND  TIRED OF  THESE  CREAMY  BEAUTY  PRODUCT  COMPANIES  THAT  GET  ON  MY  NERVES  WITH  ALL  THE  CLEANING  AND  WASHING  TO  REMOVE  THEM,  THIS  ONE  IS  CLEAR  SEA  GREEN  AND  EASY  TO  HANDLE,  ALSO  TUMERIC  IS  IN  IT  WHICH  IS  INGREDIENT  GOD  MADE  MEANTION  WORLD  WIDE  FOR  MANY  AILMENT S.  DOESNT  BURN  YOUR  SKIN ,  AT  LEAST  NOT  YET ,  HHH.  BUT  SO  FAR  I  LOVE  IT.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Better than any other product which I used earlier</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t live up to what it says about the fact that it &amp;#34;reduces pimple&amp;#34; and its what you would call your normal face wash</li>
    <li> Great product for keeping your face clean and reducing blemishes. Its not a miracle product and will not be the answer to never having another breakout, but it&#x27;s as good, if not better, than other chemical based products.</li>
    <li> Great product for those of us with Rosacea and other sensitive skin issues. Works well at cleansing, and then restoring moisture to the skin...FINALLY found a product I plan to stick with!</li>
    <li> My skin feels good and i like the idea of fewer ingredients but I prefer other products. Saw it on Dr. Oz but, for me, this was not the best.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with adult acne for a year and have seen a dramatic improvement in my skin since starting this face wash</li>
    <li> I have been using the face wash for a week now. I like how my skin feels. Clean, but not stripped like some other washes leave me feeling.</li>
    <li> They have changed this product entirely- It used to be all natural and a really good face wash.  Now it is full of colorants and chemicals.The store itself was reliable and offered good service</li>
    <li> Always great to be able to try new products.  I got this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all after using a full bottle. Also it has artifical colorings and chemicals that I don&#x27;t recc. putting on your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant so I needed an all natural face wash. It comes out kind of like a jell, but it gets the job done . You may need to follow it up with an astringent for squeaky clean after you wash with it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel the product was all that great or special! Would not buy it again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend!</li>
    <li> i love this product and the packaging.  the quality is excellent, and i will get many hours of use from it</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash. It helps keep my oily, acne prone skin clear.  I use it with my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I like using it because it makes me feel very clean afterwards.  People have commented to me that I look healthier.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your face feeling very soft. It&#x27;s great for removing makeup too. What I&#x27;ve found works best for me when using this product is to use a facial scrub in the morning, wash with Neem Face Wash, then I use a Mary Kay oil free facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like Neem facial cleanser because it is a natural product that cleanses away daily makeup and other particles  from my skin deeply without  chemicals that irritate and harm my skin. It helps fight breakouts and diminishes  years of built up spots on my face. I highly recommend it along with other Neem products.</li>
    <li> Initially this product worked well, with continued use my skin got extremely DRY, even peeling and then it didn&#x27;t control my acne. So I had dry skin w/acne bumps. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this face wash after ready all the reviews and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. A little goes a long way and it lathers fairly quickly with warm water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now &amp; I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had problem skin for years &amp; I&#x27;ve spent alot of time &amp; money on OTC products as well as dermatologist visits. All of my efforts were either too costly or non effective. After hearing about the Neem products &amp; doing a bit of research I decided to give it a try &amp; it actually works just as well, if not better, as those other costly products. I have very oily skin so I use it twice daily, as directed, &amp; my skin not only feels cleaner &amp; smoother, but the breakouts have completely stopped. The thing I love most about this product is the fact that there are no harsh chemicals that will irritate my sensitive skin. I definitely recommend this product to anyone with problem skin.</li>
    <li> This smells really good, but unfortunately made my face get a series of small bumps on my forehead. When I stopped using it, and switched to another cleanser, the bumps disappeared. Wish that it would have worked, because it is very affordable.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this face wash and I very much like it (still!).  It does smell a bit funny, like a citrus cleaner, but I ignore it because the product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal! Just started using and love it. It is a different fresh, healthy, younger looking skin all over my face and neck areas.</li>
    <li> Not good made my skin oily . Disappointed when you have lot of expectation.</li>
    <li> Wonderful face soap! My complexion has noticeably calmed down and cleared up significantly since switching from my usual drugstore buys to this. I use it with my clarisonic. It leaves my face feeling clean without overly drying up my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Feels good to the skin. I will definitely purchase this again and recommend to others with problems with acne.</li>
    <li> Love this.face wash...it feels great while washing and after.it.feels refreshing. My face actually looked smoother. I will buy more.:-) I only wish it was a larger tube so I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. It makes my face feel clean and fresh. I have had a nagging rash at the corner of my mouth (dermatitis) and Neem made it disappear almost immediately! I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Was recommended to use this product by a friend for childrens acne.  Seems to really help without being drying or too harsh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two fever blisters in my life. I was having the second one when this face wash arrived and I put some on the blister for a few minutes and then washed it off. I did that twice a day and by the second evening, that sucker was gone. I used it on the blister as a fluke but then I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt so I tried it. My wife loves it because she used to get these little bumps, not zits but tiny bumps, on her face. It took less than a week and they were all but gone.</li>
    <li> I received the item as promised.  I have not use the the face wash yet, but I like the smell.  I am looking forward to using it.</li>
    <li> It took almost 10 days for delivery. But the product is awesome.</li>
    <li> Works so well and so fast! I&#x27;ll never use another facial cleansing product again. This is all in need!</li>
    <li> This face wash is marketed as all natural and promises to give you blemish-free skin. It&#x27;s targeted for oily-skinned people, and I consider myself to fit in that category. However, it dried my skin out and made me look oilier later in the day. It felt like it irritated my existing acne and I had much more bumps than usual, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel clean all around. I&#x27;m having someone else in the house who doesn&#x27;t have acne use up the rest of this. It might work for those with *very* oily skin or who don&#x27;t have much acne issues.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a month or so very nice product.</li>
    <li> This really helps eliminate pimples! I use it 2-3 times per day.</li>
    <li> I just wish it had more neem in it. But otherwise I liked it and it came with no problem.</li>
    <li> I really like this product even though it feels a bit drying after washing it.  It has a nice aloe scent and I love that it removes all eye makeup which some cleansers you cannot use around the eyes.  It is very gentle and I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> This is the most powerful wash for acne I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s very gentle and smells good. It&#x27;s tough and effective, I have less pimples after daily use. It&#x27;s not over drying. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This product smells good and makes my skin feel fabulous! I am very happy I decided to try this product...</li>
    <li> I love this product. The face wash makes my skin feel so clean and since I have been using it have noticed less skin breakouts. would highly recommend this face wash to others.</li>
    <li> love it! It works for me and I have use this product for awhile. I wanted to repurchase it but it takes too long to arrive since it&#x27;s from different country.</li>
    <li> After just a few times using this product, I could feel the softer difference in my skin. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Very good product! I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and I love it! It keeps my skin clear at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27; not harsh. I noticed that I&#x27;m not getting as much acne as before i started using it.</li>
    <li> This came as a recommendation from a friend so I decided to try it and LOVE the feel on my face after I use ths ace wash.  I will be buying more regularly.</li>
    <li> Cleared up the few zits I had coming in due to pms after one use. Love the way my face feels after its not to dry or oily.</li>
    <li> This worked fine.  I use it every night when I wash my face.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out like the other Neem products. My skin is already dry and sensitive.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel clean without drying it out. I don&#x27;t see as many pimples, I hope my dark spot start to lighten up we we&#x27;ll see with time.</li>
    <li> Neem was recommended on a show as a natural anti bacterial and I bought this for my granddaughter and it is working beautifully!</li>
    <li> Himalaya drugs is a pioneer in herbal medicines and they are to be commended for the way they placed Indian herbal knowledge on a modern scientific pedestal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is made of a blend of Neem and Turmeric. Both of these are known for their benevolent effect upon skin. In combination, they can be a great help to those who suffer from acne/pimples. What is more, the formulation is very pleasant to use. Being herbal formulations, there is no reported side effects -- though all medications, herbal or allopathic, always need to be tested before one uses them regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this herbal face wash.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and really cleans your face well - if you have oily skin this may be a great product for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice face wash, keep your face clean. I always do three-steps-cleansing for my skin. First wash, then tonic, then moisturizer. If the cotton pad I use to tone my face is clean that means that the was was good.&lt;br /&gt;I can not state the anti-acne effect yet since I&#x27;ve been using the wash just for two days.&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing I don&#x27;t like  - it&#x27;s not foamy enough for me. I just love foamy face wash, though I understand it doesn&#x27;t contain soap and is only my personal thing.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, fair, oily/combination skin. I am very acne prone, so I have tried many facial products! I absolutely love this face wash. With regular use, it keeps my skin very clear and it lasts a long time. I can use just a very small pea-sized amount with my Clarisonic Brush and am able to get a rich lather for my face. It&#x27;s tempting to use more, but it isn&#x27;t necessary. I also use the matching Face Mask! I highly recommend this for someone looking for a more natural face wash and has a similar issues with their skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some improvements after using it. I recommend it to all my friends with acne (scars). It is much better than proactive.</li>
    <li> I like it .I thought of continuing the item .</li>
    <li> I received this product on time. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I like this face wash. The only thing is my skin feels really tight afterwards and not the most refreshed. However, I use a really good moisturizer and it feels fine. So even though it&#x27;s tight and not refreshed feeling, it&#x27;s not drying. My skin is normal to oily.</li>
    <li> This is a good product -- it gets sudsy, smells good, and it got my face clean.  But I will probably continue using Cetaphil, which works just as well and I don&#x27;t have to order it online.  This was priced right at under $10.</li>
    <li> Lathers great, good value for money, really cleans well. I would  recommend this product to my friends and family and coworkers.</li>
    <li> I just received this and it is not full. However the product I love and works well with my skin</li>
    <li> Love this makes my skin feel clean. Gets the makeup. And seems to be taking away my acne scaring</li>
    <li> The best for acne prone skin! got this to try and bam!! Almost all pimples and acne scars are almost completely gone! After a month of using it ! I&#x27;m ready to buy another bottle ! Love this!! Really works!! And the price is very cheap and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Great product, can&#x27;t wait to see the affects after using it for a longer time.  You only need a small amount to cleanse your face and leaves no residue, only very clean skin.</li>
