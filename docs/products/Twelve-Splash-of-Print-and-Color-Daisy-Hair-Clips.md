      <li>Oh and the seller was really nice!</li>
      <li>Granddaughter Loved them.</li>
      <li>i loved them.</li>
      <li>Good quality, they&#x27;ve lasted through pillow fights, run-through-the-sprinkler sessions, being grabbed at by babies, etc, etc.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love them all!</li>
      <li>I clip them to MANY things!</li>
      <li>These are so cute, I&#x27;ve ended up &#x27;borrowing&#x27; them!</li>
      <li>:) Will be purchasing again, for sure!</li>
      <li>I very much recommend these beautiful flowers. :)</li>
      <li>I love these I ordered 2 sets so both my girls had them and didn&#x27;t fight over the colors.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>There were 12 different types of color of flowers which is awesome:)</li>
      <li>They are absolutely adorable.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Very cool colors</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re going to be perfect for my little niece. :)</li>
      <li>The colors aren&#x27;t exactly as shown in the picture, but they&#x27;re cute!</li>
      <li>such a great product.</li>
      <li>still a pretty good price fast delivery</li>
      <li>This was a great product, although it did take a long time to get here</li>
      <li>Some of the petals were bent, but most of them were straight.</li>
      <li>I was very please with how they were packaged, most of the ones picture were the ones I received</li>
      <li>so there are some that look completely appropriate for a 30 year old to wear.</li>
      <li>pretty and well made, variety of color.</li>
      <li>They are perfect for me and my daughter because were are both animal print obsessed.</li>
      <li>they are pretty and i gave them as a gift.</li>
      <li>received 13 flowers but 1 did not have a clip colors not as nice as pictures some of the gems in middle were different colors and did not look as nice as white.  </li>
      <li>and I would love to order again very soon, The only thing I disliked was the timing but other than that the product it self was excellent!</li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment</li>
      <li>I received these flower bows in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>made very well</li>
      <li>very pretty&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
      <li>the flowers were very cute but many of them were dirty, fraying on the end of the pedals, or the pedals were bent.</li>
      <li>I got this in less than 1 week and the package was pretty light.</li>
      <li>The closest thing I have to a complaint is the clip is salon style; I&#x27;d prefer more of an alligator clip to help it stay in a little better, but really it holds in just fine, as long as you don&#x27;t have a baby trying to rip it out.</li>
      <li>It did have some hot glue on the flower at the back</li>
      <li>I will have to redo because I didn&#x27;t wont it to hurt my 3 month old</li>

    <li> shd have guessed.. u get what u pay for.. don&#x27;t feel like trying the product either.. would never recommend it..</li>
    <li> This was a great product, although it did take a long time to get here I was very please with how they were packaged, most of the ones picture were the ones I received and I would love to order again very soon, The only thing I disliked was the timing but other than that the product it self was excellent! I very much recommend these beautiful flowers. :)</li>
    <li> I clip them to MANY things! Including clothing, curtain ties and made hair-bows with them! They are very cute! Fast shipment and I will buy more!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I received these all in the same bag. Some of the petals were bent, but most of them were straight. The colors aren&#x27;t exactly as shown in the picture, but they&#x27;re cute! They&#x27;re going to be perfect for my little niece. :)</li>
    <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;it was money saving and very pretty&lt;br /&gt;buy this and be a very happy person&lt;br /&gt;happy happy</li>
    <li> I only received  10 flowers instead of 12..some of the pedals were all bent..disappointed</li>
    <li> Beautiful flowers but they&#x27;re so horribly made. There is like 5 inches of glue between the clip and flower. They would have been great but they don&#x27;t even sit properly on the head with all of that glue. Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I got them they are wonderful colors but im not happy with the lumps on the back I will have to redo because I didn&#x27;t wont it to hurt my 3 month old and I only received 11 out of 12 and 1 clip was not right it has teeth I will replace that as well.  Im not sure I will order from this company again.</li>
    <li> the flowers were very cute but many of them were dirty, fraying on the end of the pedals, or the pedals were bent. also a few of the clips on them were coming off of the flower.</li>
    <li> they are pretty and i gave them as a gift. such a great product. i loved them. made very well</li>
    <li> Not like i thought... too small. Way too small. Not like the description at all</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them all! Very cool colors and they are actually all put together which is different from some other one (I guess..according to the reviews on others). I usually get my hair flowers in store but those are at least $5 a piece and these I got 12 for a little over $12....Yeah, awesome deal and beautiful flower clips!</li>
    <li> These are seriously the CUTEST flowers I ever saw/bought. They are perfect for me and my daughter because were are both animal print obsessed. They also match the headbands I already had.</li>
    <li> received 13 flowers but 1 did not have a clip colors not as nice as pictures some of the gems in middle were different colors and did not look as nice as white.  still a pretty good price fast delivery</li>
    <li> I got this in less than 1 week and the package was pretty light. There were 12 different types of color of flowers which is awesome:) This is a great deal for everyone. It also came with a red hairband which was not mentioned in the discription I guess was an added bonus. It did have some hot glue on the flower at the back but you can just peel it off not  big deal. Oh and the seller was really nice!</li>
    <li> I received these flower bows in a very timely manner. They are absolutely adorable. Great variety of colors and all of them are in excellent shape. Giving a few as gifts. I look forward to purchasing from this seller again. Thank u!</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter and her friends, since they have a bad habit of taking off with my hair flowers. These are so cute, I&#x27;ve ended up &#x27;borrowing&#x27; them! They all have zebra print, but it&#x27;s in varying degrees so there are some that look completely appropriate for a 30 year old to wear. :) Good quality, they&#x27;ve lasted through pillow fights, run-through-the-sprinkler sessions, being grabbed at by babies, etc, etc. The closest thing I have to a complaint is the clip is salon style; I&#x27;d prefer more of an alligator clip to help it stay in a little better, but really it holds in just fine, as long as you don&#x27;t have a baby trying to rip it out. :) Will be purchasing again, for sure!</li>
    <li> Some of the flowers were bent</li>

    <li> pretty and well made, variety of color. Granddaughter Loved them.</li>
