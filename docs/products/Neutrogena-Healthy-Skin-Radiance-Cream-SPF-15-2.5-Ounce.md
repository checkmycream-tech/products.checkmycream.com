      <li>so its great for those with oily skin</li>
      <li>Goes great under makeup or by itself.</li>
      <li>it is  good for me</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind that, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
      <li>but it does make your skin look a good bit healthier when you do</li>
      <li>and so it must be good.  </li>
      <li>For the price, I&#x27;ve found creams in drug stores just as good as this.  </li>
      <li>This is a good value, goes on without feeling greasy and my skin looks nice.  </li>
      <li>A very experienced aesthetician once told me that Neutrogena has the most scientifically advanced products in the market.</li>
      <li>I love the smell!  </li>
      <li>It is great and cheap compared to Olay.</li>
      <li>and my skin looks nice after application.</li>
      <li>Good product that&#x27;s non greasy and gives the skin a brighter, more even complexion.  </li>
      <li>All-round reliable and effective product.</li>
      <li>The price was great and delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>and i think  the fragrance is too strong!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is so strong and off-putting that I had to throw it away!</li>
      <li>But the fragrance is too strong!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Moisture for years and love it.</li>
      <li>I follow the cleaning with either the Radiance cream or the Healthy Skin lotion.</li>
      <li>For day use, I then use Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Enhancer.</li>
      <li>I works OK, but nothing I&#x27;d rave about.</li>
      <li>I love this face cream.  </li>
      <li>&quot; many years ago</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I like this one much, much better.  </li>
      <li>I had been using the Healthy Skin Face lotion with good success.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Really love this stuff and have said so before.</li>
      <li>as far as I&#x27;m concerned the fragrance isn&#x27;t strong at all&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy, skin looks great after</li>
      <li>This product is light and can be used alone or under makeup.  </li>
      <li>It provides a light coverage</li>
      <li>Naturally, I love Amazon&#x27;s get prices and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>And unlike my normal lotion, which is fragrance free, this one has a very strong floral aroma.</li>
      <li>It is not as much of a moisturizer as the Healthy Skin Lotion, but it does have some moisturizing properties.</li>
      <li>Love the dispenser bottle, and most especially....</li>
      <li>I live in Southwest Florida, and this is light and smooth.  </li>
      <li>After several exposures to the sun, I can achieve a nice tan without the faceburning I used to get.  </li>
      <li>More expensive products may have slightly better consistencies or aromas, but Neutrogena&#x27;s products are as effective as anything out there.</li>
      <li>I have been a long-time user of Neutrogena products, so was interested to see how this would work for me.</li>
      <li>I alternate between the Radiance Cream and the Healthy Skin Lotion.</li>
      <li>I believe her because no matter what else I&#x27;ve tried, I always come back to Neutrogena, especiall the Healthy Skin line which battles aging and blemishes.</li>
      <li>When I re-ordered, didn&#x27;t check carefully enough and got this Healthy Skin formula, instead.</li>
      <li>This product was good as it did not cause breakout, but it&#x27;s heavy on the skin.</li>
      <li>My wife consistently uses this face cream and really likes it.  </li>
      <li>I use it in conjunction with the other Neutrogena products from the Healthy line.</li>
      <li>I contacted Neutrogena corporate headquarters and they told me they don&#x27;t sell Healthy Skin Radiance CREAM, only LOTION.  </li>
      <li>It gives energy to my skin, my face seems younger and feels fresh</li>
      <li>Due to skin issues with Sodium Laurel Sulfate, I use Free and Clear cleanser AM and PM.</li>
      <li>lotion goes on silly smooth and gives my face a natural glow when I need it most.</li>
      <li>I really like Neutrogena&#x27;s products in general.  </li>
      <li>, the sunscreen smell is a tad obvious but not so much I cant deal with it.</li>
      <li>, my skin looks clearer and brighter as well as my pores are not as apparent when I use this, its not heavy even with the sunscreen in it</li>
      <li>This item is out of stock and this supplier is not honest by saying that it is available.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really love this stuff and have said so before. I&#x27;m always a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This is a good value, goes on without feeling greasy and my skin looks nice.  But the fragrance is too strong!  If you don&#x27;t mind that, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> I have been a long-time user of Neutrogena products, so was interested to see how this would work for me. I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and some anti-aging concerns. I had been using the Healthy Skin Face lotion with good success. This Radiance Cream is also very good. It is not as much of a moisturizer as the Healthy Skin Lotion, but it does have some moisturizing properties. I have noticed a brightening and I also like the SPF 15 as well. I alternate between the Radiance Cream and the Healthy Skin Lotion. Due to skin issues with Sodium Laurel Sulfate, I use Free and Clear cleanser AM and PM. I follow the cleaning with either the Radiance cream or the Healthy Skin lotion. For day use, I then use Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Enhancer. I gave up using \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; many years ago when I started using the Enhancer. It provides a light coverage and I like the pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> With the change in my skin due to age (40+) I needed something that would protect my skin without making me feel as though I had cut all access to oxygen off from my face.  This product is light and can be used alone or under makeup.  I use it in conjunction with the other Neutrogena products from the Healthy line.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I live in Southwest Florida, and this is light and smooth.  Love the dispenser bottle, and most especially....unlike other reviewers....I love the smell!  It reminds me of suntan lotion and summer.....and my skin looks nice after application.</li>
    <li> This product was good as it did not cause breakout, but it&#x27;s heavy on the skin. I prefer other brands which do not feel so heavy.</li>
    <li> Thank you for prompt shipment of this product!  It is a staple!</li>
    <li> Wish they still made this product!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used in my lifetime.  It smoothens my skin and does not bleach my skin.  Evens my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena facial moisturizer for years and I thought I&#x27;d try this one for the radiance and wrinkle-reducing qualities.  The fragrance is so strong and off-putting that I had to throw it away! I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream.  It is non greasy and protects my skin against the sun.  After several exposures to the sun, I can achieve a nice tan without the faceburning I used to get.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> My wife consistently uses this face cream and really likes it.  She just keeps ordering it and so it must be good.  Naturally, I love Amazon&#x27;s get prices and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> You wont \\&quot;shine\\&quot; when you use this but it does make your skin look a good bit healthier when you do, my skin looks clearer and brighter as well as my pores are not as apparent when I use this, its not heavy even with the sunscreen in it so its great for those with oily skin, the sunscreen smell is a tad obvious but not so much I cant deal with it.</li>
    <li> A very experienced aesthetician once told me that Neutrogena has the most scientifically advanced products in the market. More expensive products may have slightly better consistencies or aromas, but Neutrogena&#x27;s products are as effective as anything out there. I believe her because no matter what else I&#x27;ve tried, I always come back to Neutrogena, especiall the Healthy Skin line which battles aging and blemishes. I use this version with SPF as a daily lotion. Goes great under makeup or by itself. All-round reliable and effective product.</li>
    <li> Good product that&#x27;s non greasy and gives the skin a brighter, more even complexion.  The price was great and delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS CREAM.  You will get a different Neutrogena product.  This item is out of stock and this supplier is not honest by saying that it is available.  I received the anti-wrinkle cream with the radiance receipt.</li>
    <li> I really like Neutrogena&#x27;s products in general.  While they may not have the healthiest ingredients, they are quality products and work.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this product to my friends. It gives energy to my skin, my face seems younger and feels fresh</li>
    <li> I was expecting a box with the cream , also the sticker on this cream bottle seems to be different from what is usually found on the body of this cream bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this on clearence at Target, so I knew I would have to go on-line to find it. It is great and cheap compared to Olay.</li>
    <li> it is  good for me and i think  the fragrance is too strong! but it is still a good thing!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena never disappoints.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion goes on silly smooth and gives my face a natural glow when I need it most.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Moisture for years and love it. When I re-ordered, didn&#x27;t check carefully enough and got this Healthy Skin formula, instead. Though it is also oil-free, it feels slightly greasier on my face. And unlike my normal lotion, which is fragrance free, this one has a very strong floral aroma. As a guy, not quite what I&#x27;m going for. But even my wife finds it overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the standard Oil-Free Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products for 30 years and when I tried this cream the texture seemed weird.  I contacted Neutrogena corporate headquarters and they told me they don&#x27;t sell Healthy Skin Radiance CREAM, only LOTION.  When I asked about Australia, Europe, Africa, etc. they said NO.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> For the price, I&#x27;ve found creams in drug stores just as good as this.  I works OK, but nothing I&#x27;d rave about.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer.  I like the feel of it and it has no odor.  I just feel moisturized.  I tried the moisturizer with alpha hydroxy in it.  I find that it has a slight odor that I don&#x27;t like and creates a tingle that I just find offensive. I like this one much, much better.  Again,  I can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore on store shelves.  What gives?</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned the fragrance isn&#x27;t strong at all&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy, skin looks great after</li>
