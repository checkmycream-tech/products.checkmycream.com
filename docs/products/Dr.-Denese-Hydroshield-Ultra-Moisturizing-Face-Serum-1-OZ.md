    <li> Great stuff. Goes on oily but dries quickly. It hydrates like no other. I use this in conjuction with DD Firming pads as part of my youth arsenel and my 45 year old skin thanks me.</li>
    <li> I really love this all Dr. Denese products!  I did try a different, highly recommended serum at a cheaper price.  Ended up giving it to a friend and purchased this again.  I have been using this for about 15 years and still love it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years and my skin looks youthful and without all the fine lines of my age group.  People always think I&#x27;m younger than I am.</li>
    <li> This serum has been great for my skin. Dr Denese&#x27;s products are genuine and not just hype. I only use her products.</li>
    <li> Hands do.wn best skin care product ever. Worth every penny and lasts for several months. Dramatically improved the quality and texture of my skin. Absorbs well and not too greasy. I get so many compliments on my complexion since using this product. My skin looks soft&lt;br /&gt;And dewy</li>
    <li> works well for night sleep, but makes skin dry in the mornings if applied after washing face</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, Love this product. It leaves your skin smooth as silk!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It is like a drink of water for your face. It is not oily or greasy... It soaks right in. The only problem is the price....The 2oz bottle is 65 dollars and change.</li>
    <li> Great day moisturizer</li>
    <li> I did not like the dry texture and the slow penetration. I did not like the strong chemical smell. It failed to do what the website that strongly recommended it claimed it would do.</li>
    <li> very smooth...not greasy</li>
    <li> My skin would look a lot older without this amazing product!!</li>
    <li> Cant be without this stuff.  I will be 60 this year and have used this for 5 years now and it has helped make me appear 10 years younger.  Love it</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and a wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m oily and acne prone and been using this for years.  Took a break and tried a few other things but nothing else has such visible results and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> I was looking so forward to this serum because of all the great reviews. I even asked a couple of the reviewers questions about this product before I bought it. I have NO idea why it got such good reviews. I do not have super dry skin and this stuff seemed to make my skin tight. So, I had to put moisturizer ON TOP of this serum, which seemed odd for a product that claimed to be ULTRA MOISTURIZING SERUM. I didn&#x27;t see any improvements in tone or texture of my skin. It wasn&#x27;t all THAT moisturizing and ended being just another product/step for my am/pm face routine. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> It is a little to heavy for my skin, but my sister has dry aging skin and loves it.</li>
    <li> Gives your complexion &amp; skin a dewy healthy looking glow</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my face feel sooooo soft.  Goes on easily and soaks in very quickly.  Most of the time I do not even need to use a moisturizer with it.  Don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.</li>
