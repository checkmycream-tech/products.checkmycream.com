    <li> Do not buy!!! I never leave reviews but this item was horrible. The brush was dry rotted or something because it broke into pieces the same day I received it. It literally crumbled in my hand after use. I have broken bristles in my hair.</li>

    <li> I have very course 4c natural hair. This brush did not work at all. It&#x27;s just like any other brush. My edges were laid for a few minutes, but after that, they were right back lifted.

    <li> The brush works pretty well. My only qualm is that I do with it Deere a harder bristled brush but outherwise it serves it&#x27;s ourpose.</li>
