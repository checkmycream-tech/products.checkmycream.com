<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This kit is so affordable. It&#x27;s practically salon good! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> cant wait to use however lid is cracked</li>
    <li> So I got the kit last week, and it was packaged as advertised. I proceeded to wax my underarm, just to see if I could wax myself. See I&#x27;ve only had waxes at a school or professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways, for the underarms, it worked amazing. A week later and there are only a few stragglers that I couldn&#x27;t see. I them tried to get my Brazilian area. Let me start this with saying, I&#x27;m a hairy person, not to get too graphic, but multiple hairs in one comical type hairy. Anywho... I got about 1/3 way finished before I started noticing how the wax was behaving. It started to stay on my skin. I would grab a strip and it would remove the targeted hair, but would leave a ton of wax on the outlining edges. I would turn the used strip over to try and use wax against wax to pick up the remaining wax, but the strip would be dry and cracked, not malleable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I adjusted the heat, but that didn&#x27;t work. It took me 2 days to get all of the remaining wax off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the kit, just not happy with the wax. I think I will try another line from the manufacturer or another brand altogether.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was my second time ordering..the first time was fine and the product itself is great. The packaging leaves much to be desired, however..wax has leaked EVERYWHERE and the cover is cracked. It is such a sticky mess that I will not even be able to return it because it is just not worth the mess it will cause.</li>
    <li> Good product, easy to follow directions. the only problem was that the cover was broken..&lt;br /&gt;Same as read in the others reviews.</li>
    <li> Love using this in the comfort of my own home!</li>
    <li> Works very well once you get the right technique down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I chose this purchase. Everything was intact, I was a little worried after reading that some people had broken lids. I took a chance, because ultimately the lid is not vital to the function anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Honey wax is messy, but you just need to be smart about it. Don&#x27;t glop a ton on your stick for starters, and make sure it&#x27;s not so hot that it&#x27;s running off before you move it away from the can.&lt;br /&gt;The strips work perfectly fine, I can only assume that anyone that had a problem with them didn&#x27;t press it on properly. The wax stickiness does seep through to your fingers which is super annoying, but I just coat them heavily with a little oil first. I used vitamin e oil, but any oil would work.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a blue wax which I&#x27;ve yet to try out. All in all this was an excellent choice, and I would make this purchase again!</li>
    <li> PERFECT for starters. Takes about 25-30 mins to heat, comes with all the extra goodies to get you started. I am very happy with mine.</li>
    <li> The Gigi Starter Kit was awesome for a beginner in waxing! It was shipped within a reasonable time, and packed nicely together. Only thing I found that was difficult was actually getting the lid off the wax. It was stuck to it and we got wax everywhere on our hands, but other then that no complaints! :)</li>
    <li> It heated good, but the strips that were included with this item were terrible. No matter how much wax I placed on myself my hair would not come off waste of money.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good set for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t use the wax on the skin around your eyes any hotter than when left at the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting. It shouldn&#x27;t burn if it&#x27;s at medium, but I found it quite hot when using the wax from just off the surface. If dipped lower, then the hotter wax very well could have burned the skin just above my eyes.</li>
    <li> Such a good price for this kit! Shipped fast and everything is great. Really happy</li>
    <li> I want to stress this: THIS IS NOT EASY TO USE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume if you&#x27;re looking at this you&#x27;re hoping to use this kit to wax yourself and save yourself an expensive trip to a salon. Though this kit does work mostly as advertised, the issue you&#x27;ll run into is that you don&#x27;t have the flexibility to do certain spots (ie the back of your legs) by yourself, thus defeating the purpose of the kit. If you&#x27;re planning on using this to wax somebody else I imagine it could work fine (mostly). The wax itself is a tad sticky and the &amp;#34;easy wax remover&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t work that well (I found olive oil was much more effective), so if you end up with some on you that hardens it can be pretty annoying to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been unimpressed by the product. I think your money would be better spend saving and going to salon.</li>
    <li> nice products to use at home</li>
    <li> This was great!  I&#x27;ve never done home waxing before, but wanted something quick for my trip to Aruba.  This was relatively cheap, and it was very easy to use.  I watched the cheesy video which was surprising useful.  My sister and I were easily able to wax my armpits and a little bit of her legs.  I&#x27;m really glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use at home and I am saving money by not going to the salon.</li>
    <li> Perfect Starter Kit! It comes with everything you need :)</li>
    <li> Great kit! The only thing that drove me nuts was the wax going through the strips which made the task unnecessarily sticky. I made the layer of wax as thin as I could and it still poked through. Easy enough to get different strips, so I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this.  Done were the days of  spending money at the salon and having to schedule wax appointments.  I could  also ensure that the wax application method was 100% sterile by doing it myself.  No, I was wrong. I followed the directions, but I let the wax heat up for over an hour and even did the pre- wax skin prep.  I applied the wax, waited 45 seconds, then ripped off the strip.  My skin was instantly inflamed, but  the hair was still there.  So I tried it a few more times.  More redness and tenderness followed, but still unruly eyebrows.  So i cranked up the setting back to high(directions says to lower it, after wax is melted) and repeated the same steps. Need less to say it still didn&#x27;t work.  So my eyebrows still need to be waxed and the hairs are now highlighted by a nice hue of red.  My quest continues for the perfect or at least one that can rip off your hairs wax kit.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> It had everything with that you would need to do your own waxing. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived my life without this!!</li>
    <li> Great I was a beginner to waxing and this kit is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I just received my warmer and while the product is as described it arrived damaged. The lid was cracked almost clear in half.</li>
    <li> I refuse to pay a stranger to torture me, so I decided to order this kit to wax my legs, underarms, and bikini. The warmer is great, except that I have to keep it well below low because even at low the wax was hot enough to burn me. Once I figured out the heat had to be sitting a hair above off, everything else has been seamless.</li>
    <li> Love it! Better than I expected and great quality. Price is very reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> Great value. The paper that comes with it is not as nice as the ones you buy in the roll (the one that looks like toilet paper). I would purchase the wax paper separately because you need more than what&#x27;s in the kit anyway.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my GIGI wax kit!!</li>
    <li> Ruined my skin and didn&#x27;t do a good job of removing hair. Very painful.</li>
    <li> After spending $60 a month on getting waxed I came to the conclusion I should just do it myself.  I found this kit which had good reviews and decided to give it a try.  I LOVE IT!  I even waxed my friends eyebrows.  I watched the video it comes with and also a few videos online before practicing on a small portion of hair.  If you can handle waxing by someone else you can handle doing it yourself, plus the amount of money you save in the long run is worth it.</li>
    <li> good products. takes bit longer to warm though so plan 20 minuts ahead</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Its the first at-home waxing product that actually took hair off my face - lip and chin.  Not easy places to wax or tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note is that it does take some time to heat up.  Then some time to wax, so its not a time saver, so much as an easy to use money saver.  Great tool for when you need to wax for the work week ahead, and can&#x27;t be bothered to go out in the rain, snow and sleet.</li>
    <li> The product  worked well im glad i purchased it no longer well I pay salon prices.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loved it. She mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t warm up too much and relieve the pain.  She is brazilian and that&#x27;s the product that she in the US. It&#x27;s the best product that she used at home.  I&#x27;m just translating what she said!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I was looking for. I love all the extra products it comes with. Even a video for amateurs like me. Now I can do it myself instead of paying somebody to do it.</li>
    <li> Got 2 Kits....&lt;br /&gt;I WAXED MINE AND MY NIECES EYEBROWS...&lt;br /&gt;BOTH OF US HAD BURNING WHEN WE OUT THE SOOTHING GEL ON AFTER WAXING... MY EYELIDS WERE AND STILL ARE AFTER 6 DAYS PEELING AND CRUSTY.&lt;br /&gt;BEEN WAXING FOR YEARS SO I KNOW WHAT IM DOING AND&lt;br /&gt;I DID IT RIGHT . THE CHEESE CLOTH IS SUPER THIN SO THE WAX BLEEDS THROUGH BIGTIME.&lt;br /&gt;I DONT LIKE THE KIT AND TRIED CANCELING THE SECOND ONE BUT WAS TOLD IT WAS TO LATE.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE THIS IS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IM WRITING ABOUT&lt;br /&gt;OTHERS MAY LOVE THIS KIT.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> The kit worked great and got the job done. The wax is super messy and was hard to remove off of my finger tips but the bottle of wax remover that comes with takes it off. Super easy to use and set up. I do wish the lid &amp;#34;snapped on&amp;#34; to the unit so it would stay in place. I would recommend getting different strips for the waxing (non woven strips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will definitely save me time and money! Great results</li>
    <li> Perfect for students use! Expected the Warmer a litter biggger</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit. Very simple to use</li>
    <li> Wax is great but I have no need for the extra stuff</li>
    <li> I loved all of it ! Wax is amazing ! But I would go ahead and by wax strips... The muslin strips are junk ! But everything else is GREAT !</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this kit 5 stars is because of the quality of the strips. I&#x27;ve used the kit twice since I purchased and in both times I had issues with the strips. If the layer of wax you put on isn&#x27;t thin enough, the thin strips get stuck easily and start to rip. To avoid this problem, I would recommend buying this kit together with a different set of strips.&lt;br /&gt;The wax isn&#x27;t too sticky and it&#x27;s manageable, but I guess any wax could feel too sticky for starters. To avoid creating a mess I would recommend putting a collar over the can and covering the floor and the area the wax will be moved through with paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;The wax off that comes with the kit seems to work for me but it comes in a small container, so it won&#x27;t last long. I only use it when my hands get sticky as I&#x27;m waxing. I use baby oil to remove any remaining wax off my body, which works just as fine and I can use it in larger volumes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s half the price of one waxing appointment at the salon for me, and does its job well.</li>
    <li> The best! Just got it and used  it with no probs. will save me a ton of money and time.</li>
    <li> Glad I got this kit. Also purchased the Calendula Gold Hard Wax with Tea Tree Oil. Easy to use with plenty of supplies.</li>
    <li> Wax was old and was not usable</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but gets very messy! I am a first time user of home waxing kit. So it was a little hard for me to use it. It works perfect but it takes forever to get the was off of your skin. Hair grows back pretty quickly too. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product for this price.</li>
    <li> Received the warmer with the lid broken in half.</li>
    <li> Great product, this comes with everything you will need to wax whatever you want. Heats up quick!! The only thing I was completely unsatisfied with is the when I went to open the wax it was all over the place I lost a good amount of wax that was stuck to the top which I had to throw out. Other than that all is well!!</li>
    <li> Great product at a really great price! The kit comes with everything you would need. The wax warmer worked perfectly with the wax. However, it was a little difficult trying to remove the left over wax residue from the skin afterwards. The Wax-Off included in the kit helped but it didn&#x27;t get rid of all of the wax.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit with everything you need.  I purchased this on Amazon for $$36.84 and is MUCH more expensive at Sally&#x27;s Beauty. The wax takes a good 15-20 minutes to warm up and does not get too hot.  I appreciate that this unit has a heat control, so once it has melted, you can move the slidder down from high to low and let it sit for hours without the product over heating.</li>
    <li> Great for home use. Saves me tons, already paid for itself in trips I didn&#x27;t have to take to the salon.</li>
    <li> Broken lid of heater. After waxing the skin is sticky and strips cannot be reused as the wax doesn&#x27;t washes away. Will never buy Gigi again. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Kit came with all I needed to start waxing. The honee was very sticky and hard to get off, I would use latex gloves covered in baby oil to avoid it and cover any furniture floors etc in old towels. It did work better than the brazillian hard wax though as it got almost every hair. Takes a while to get used to waxing but now I love it!</li>
    <li> This is actually not Tyler, I am actually his fiancee and bought it through his account, but I absolutely love this product! Fast shipping and I read some reviews before I bought it, some people were saying that the wax leaks through the cloths, it does NOT, if you do not cake on the wax and let it cool to a decent temp (to where the cloth will still stick to the wax so you can take it off) it does not leak through, also, someone saying that the wax off does not work, I still had some left over wax next to my eyebrows after I pulled the cloth off, put some of the wax off on and it came right off, I guess you just have to be a little experienced to use the product because if you are getting wax all over the floor and all over your skin when you do it, then you may not be able to get it off, but if it is a small amount of wax (which most people will get where it is not wanted) then you can get it off no problem. This is great and comes with everything you need! I also used the slow grow, it has only been 2 days, but seems to be working okay!</li>
    <li> The DVD is little more than an after hours infomercial that leaves you with more questions than actual answers. Went to youtube videos for how to videos to get the proper application technique and proper wax temperature before applying. Apart from that good starter product for the price.</li>
    <li> I totally love this set.  I use it on myself and my daughter.  I bought it after going to a spa for a wax and the girl was double dipping in her wax, this made me really grossed out, so I bought this to try.  I think it works great, and is much more sanitary to use myself.  I have bought a refill and still love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself for a birthday gift and when I got it the lid was nearly broke in half and the strips they give you to take off the wax aren&#x27;t very good! I would recommend some other kind of strips to remove the wax!</li>
    <li> I am a begginer to waxing and this is a great starter kit to learn with.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I have lived this long without this!!!</li>
    <li> The pot works fine but the wax is useless.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit in December of last year and have used it a few times satisfactorily.  I am as meticulous as I can working with it because the nature of the honey wax is very sticky.  The heating pot worked fine and I had hot wax within 20-30 min. However, when I went to use it today, the wax had leaked out of the container, thru til the bottom of the box, then onto my closet shelf where i stored it and then onto my floor, leaving about 1/4 or less of the wax left.  Obviously a defect in the pot.  I have emailed for assistance and waiting for reply.  Poor poor quality packaging.</li>
    <li> This product is very messy.  Wax Takes long to heat up.  Products that came with the kit to remove excess wax no effective . Difficult to remove wax if accidentally spills.  Not happy at all..</li>
    <li> Wax is hard to remove</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with the wax kit, only disappointment is it came with a cracked lid.</li>
    <li> great price and everything included to get going.. not enough sticks, so make sure to order them when you purchase this kit</li>
    <li> i loved it so much it is perfect</li>
    <li> Fast shipping 🙌🏻 and great quality for amazing price! 😍 love it</li>
    <li> Easy to use kit, comes with everything you need to get started waxing at home.  Very good results with first use.</li>
    <li> The product works great. Poor packaging. One of the bottles had spilled all over the box.</li>
    <li> it takes forever to warm up!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice kit, but is not for starters .. You have to know what you are doing before you buy this. !</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this. it ended up ripping my skin off. Took 2 weeks to heal. will be sending back.</li>
    <li> Such a money saver! Wish it came with more muslin strips and the wax remover.</li>
    <li> i like the product but the wax is way too sticky! if you decide to buy it i also recommend that you purchase baby oil because it will help with the stickiness.</li>
    <li> Excellent! This is the first waxer I&#x27;ve ever bought, I&#x27;m very impressed. The can of wax that come with it works great. Will last a long time. I&#x27;ve used it about 10&#x27;times and can&#x27;t even tell there is any wax missing. Not impressed with the wax remover that came with it. Doesn&#x27;t work. I just use baby oil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s w great starter kit loving it.</li>
    <li> Got my wax kit a few days ago and it came with the brown lid broken. Unfortunately I needed to use it immediately and did not have the time to return it and wait for a new kit. Other than that it works perfectly and I&#x27;m satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> I just used this for first time. It&#x27;s messy but soooo amazing!!!!! Thank u Gigli!!</li>
    <li> product was what it was described it was well packed made it to me safe. need to get something else to make it a little less messy (better applicator) but it works great and has been a success for me so far.</li>
    <li> It does solve the purpose but it&#x27;s very sticky and hard to remove. I was doing underarm and for some reason unable to pull the cloth. That&#x27;s it. Wax got stick and took 2 days to come out of underarm. I will not use this wax anymore.</li>
    <li> This product works great so far I was pleased with the amount of stuff that was in the box. Plus shipping Was faster than I though</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the wax it comes with. It&#x27;s very messy and sticky. I use the Brazilian hard wax instead by same company and am quite pleased. Now if I could only get someone to do the backs of my legs!?</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;m very pleased with the starter kit.</li>
    <li> This kit is great.  It comes with everything you need and I found the actual hair removal process to be relatively painless, just don’t spill this wax anywhere!  I dropped a few drops on the floor and I’ve been stepping in it for days…I spent like 40 minutes trying to get it off with a box cutter and other items with no luck. You also have to be careful handling the wax because when I was done with the whole process, I had wax all over my fingers and it was miserable.  I guess there is a learning curve but seriously, there has to be a better way!  I’m very satisfied with the actual waxing results though…my skin looks awesome.</li>
    <li> This product comes with everything it says nothing was missing. I personally still need more practice but I&#x27;m so happy I got this because with my busy schedule I dont have time to go to a place and get them done so I love this!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the wax it came with... It ripped my boyfriends skin and he bleed and the wax wouldn&#x27;t come off my skin for a couple of days</li>
    <li> The worst experience of my life, The wax remover DOES NOT WORK. Because of that I had was all over my legs and hands that lasted for days... I was stickey for days! Will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!!! The only problem are the sticks there to small for the leg and arm area</li>
    <li> The warmer does not work. Used it once and for the second time it stopped working.</li>
    <li> Everything was good. Working well&lt;br /&gt;Except the strips. I don&#x27;t know whether if it&#x27;s too thin or something else, when applied honey on skin, honey went thru the strip so it became all sticky. So it was hard to use</li>
    <li> Awsome not a pro but does the job great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m was very disappointed the top to the pot warmer was broke when I receive it . An they would not replace it . Very disappointing. When u spend your money an don&#x27;t get what u pay for .</li>
    <li> This is a nice starter kit</li>
    <li> I got this last week and the first thing that i noticed was that the brown dome/cover was cracked. almost all the way through. I hope we can replace this soon I could not find the proper contact information to email you directly so I am leaving this review.&lt;br /&gt;The wax is ok  but the wax off doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love my kit. I bought this for personal use and I love the fact that it keeps the wax at an even temp unlike microwave wax. The lotions are nice and the wax off works amazing. Great!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome starter wax kit. I have never used a waxing kit before, but this kit made it easy. I would get this product again.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford the constant need to wax at nail salon. Over fifty and the hormones play tricks on a woman&#x27;s facial hairs. Now the little hairs above my lips or checks will leave with ease and the $$(20-25) a month will go in the savings.&lt;br /&gt;Only caution I would advise use a tray to set items on as honey wax can get messy, but after a few times ive got it under control. Test temp of wax before placing on area to be treated and follow all step with lotions and powder included.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on eyes brows too!&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up but only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Perfect, worked great for my gf who was doing nails/waxing from home</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect!  I had laser hair removal and was unhappy with the results, so I recently started waxing again with the Sally Hanson waxing kit.  I used to be professionally waxed, but I have seen it done so many times I decided to give it a try.  The Sally Hanson kit worked but was messy, you have to heat it up and reheat it in the microwave, and didn&#x27;t come with enough strips.  It took about 3 of the Sally Hanson kits to wax legs, underarms, and bikini at $10 each ($30 total).  The GiGi student starter kit comes with so much more, the cleanser and powder work really great.  I heated the wax on high and it spread in and easily on my skin.  The wax takes off all of the hair easily, no bruises or red blotches left behind.  I only used about 1/4 of the container of wax for underarms, legs and bikini.  The muslin cloth strips are so much better than the paper strips that were in the Sally Hanson kit.  The wax remover cream works ok, I recommend using baby oil or any other type of skin oil you have instead.  If you get wax on the floor, goo gone works great to clean it up.  I like the lotion to put on after waxing also.  The lid was cracked on my kit, but you really dont need it anyways, I threw it away.  Overall, I am really happy with this kit.  It is time consuming, but definitely less time consuming than the Sally Hanson kit because of the wax warmer.  The wax is also a much better quality than the Sally Hanson wax.  The Sally Hansons wax got stuck on my legs and caused bruising and red blotchiness.  I have also tried the veet waxing strips and they are horrible, I waxed my underarms 3 different times and never got rid of the hair and were painful.  This kit has everything that you would expect when having a wax at the salon.  I highly recommend it for less painful, easier waxing without any bruising or red blotches!  I was also able to wax my legs with only 1/8&amp;#34; of hair and it worked great!</li>
    <li> My package arrived on time which was good. But the lid of the heater was cracked and the tin of wax was bent at the top. The wax is very sticky and leaks through the strips. It works pretty good but I can still see lil hairs everywhere. It took around 30 minutes to heat up. The wax off stuff is a joke. Baby oil works better and you don&#x27;t have to rub your skin raw to get it off. But at $40 you can&#x27;t beat it for everything included.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these waxing kits in the past in other salons so I&#x27;m not surprised that I&#x27;m happy with the product itself.  I was disappointed because the cover for the wax warmer was broken when I opened the box.  I can use it, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s cracked and I paid for something that should have arrived in &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this package. It is a one stop shop for your needs of DIY waxing. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this kit almost three times already. (I lost my other two while i was moving.) It cost efficent and works amazing! The only con i would have is that it could get a little messy but that is expected of all at home waxing kits.</li>
    <li> Really, if you want to torture yourself this way, this is a great kit. It has everything you need to get the job done, all in one box, plus instructions. It&#x27;s quite painful to do, but that&#x27;s not the kit&#x27;s fault ;) It may be better to have a helper that can rip the strips off for you because after the first couple it&#x27;s kind of hard to do it quickly because you know what to expect!</li>
    <li> Very hard to use, the wax was very runny and it hurt A LOT with the clothes, not to mention that the cloth strips had lent all over them, which created a big mess. I believe I will try the warmer again, with hard wax, that doesnt require cloth or paper strips.</li>
    <li> Blah, made a huge mess, did not know what I was doing and not easy to heat to right temperature.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and I already wish it didn&#x27;t come with hemp. That doesn&#x27;t get the job done very well. I would recommend buying some separate waxing strips with this kit. The wax is great though! It heats up quickly. Everything came as described. Everything works well. I&#x27;ll definitely be saving money because I won&#x27;t have to go to the salon. All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied and like this product!</li>
    <li> I loved it, worked great. Very easy to use if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> this is awesome! everything you need for a great price it shipped on time and i used it as soon as i got it and i loveee it!</li>
    <li> You need to have someone wax for you until you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. Especially if you do not know what your doing. I like it and the instructions were clear and simple.</li>
    <li> Loved this kit ! came with everything I need. Instructions were simple and quick to learn. It wont be messy if your not messy, you need to know what your doing. Good bye waxing salon, HELLO EXTRA CASH IN MY POCKET. !!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit after seeing the salon that I go to uses this exact wax warmer, and I must say, it works amazingly! The wax takes about an hour to warm up. It removes almost every hair. I don&#x27;t care for the wax remover it comes with. I find that baby oil works much better.</li>
    <li> So happy with this! No more trips to the salon!</li>
    <li> Good for the price! I&#x27;m a total beginner but it was easy</li>
    <li> This kit creates one big mess...I would anyday prefer the roll on ones compared to this....sheer waste of money...</li>
    <li> Kit was a nice start for someone newer to waxing. We have used it a few times and are very happy.</li>
    <li> Great kit the only downside is this type of wax that is included I would say if you had the money to maybe order a different type of wax. Gigi has a whole bunch of different types. This type of wax is just very sticky and can get everywhere if you are not super careful.</li>
    <li> I love it! only thing, even if you put the lid back on the wax, the wax will spill out. all over my warmer and all over the floor.... still step on sticky spots and it&#x27;s been a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Great kit for the price! My wife and daughter have been using it for a while now and have no issues.</li>
    <li> This is a good kit and good value. I use it to wax myself at home. Compared to other waxes and methods I have used it is very good and effective at removing hair. It is a little messy if you&#x27;re not careful with it and the wax remover that comes with it does not remove all the wax from skin or other items you get it on.</li>
    <li> I love this kit. Very easy to use, and its so much cheaper than going to the salon. ive had so many issues with the salons getting wax in my hair, and messing up my brows, but im able to do my eyebrows exactly how i want them done with this kit. they look great!&lt;br /&gt;I do have one complaint though. The cooling gel that you use after you wax BURNS. It has menthol in it, and made my skin irritated to the point that it actually bled! Do not use it. Baby oil works great for moisturizing after you wax, and it also works great at cleaning off wax.</li>
    <li> No more wasting money on a simple wax that I can now so at home. This is very sticky tho. I just need to buy a different wax but other then that..works great.</li>
    <li> Though there is a learning curve, the kit will pay for itself quickly. It definitely works well, and it gets easier with experience. Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I liked the wax warmer a lot. As it is a complete kit, it&#x27;s convenient to get started as you get it. Though the manual says 25 to 30 mins, it took quite longer for the wax to melt at high temp.&lt;br /&gt;The wax is very sticky, have to be extra careful while handling it. I used olive oil to remove the wax from skin, it works better than the wax off cream</li>
    <li> This was my first time when I wanted to try waxing at home. I always did waxing in salon. I already knew how to do the waxing, coz I observed salon people doing waxing a lot before experimenting it on me. I observed the consistency of the wax &amp; tried waxing my sis hands hence, I was not fully dependent on the instruction book.  More hot wax will burn your skin &amp; less hot will stick to your skin so be careful while heating d wax. I do agree with rest of the reviewers that putting collar around the wax machine did help me a lot as in not creating whole lot of mess. Happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kit contains:&lt;br /&gt;1. One wax warmer with cover (14 ounce)&lt;br /&gt;2. One all-purpose honey wax (14 ounce)&lt;br /&gt;3. One wax off (4 ounce)&lt;br /&gt;4. One slow grow (4 ounce)&lt;br /&gt;5. One pre hon (reduces inflammation)&lt;br /&gt;6. One epilation powder (2.5oz)&lt;br /&gt;7. 10 petite applicators&lt;br /&gt;8. 10 small accu edge applicators&lt;br /&gt;9. 10 large accu edge applicators&lt;br /&gt;10. 20 small natural muslin strips&lt;br /&gt;11. 20 large natural muslin strips</li>
    <li> The lid came cracked and it was definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great value!</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for personal use at home. It comes with everything I needed plus some items to try out to potentially purchase in the future. It is perfect for my needs and would also be great for small business needing wax kit. It&#x27;s not very bulky or hard to use. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs wax kit for personal or small business uee.</li>
    <li> The product was of good quality.  It works well and I thought price was very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to others</li>
    <li> Everything I could ask for in more, it is super easy to follow along the directions, perfect for those quick at home wax treatments. My eyebrows have never been happier!</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say bad about this, is that the box was a little beat up.</li>
    <li> Only used it once. Just too messy.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is a must-have for anyone with teenage girls who like to have their eyebrows waxed.  Easy to use.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> As far as a starter kit goes its got everything you need. Personally, I don&#x27;t like the warmer because it only has two settings and doesn&#x27;t get very warm. There is definitely enough supplies to do a far amount of waxing. One last note is that it comes only with muslin. Again, I am not a huge fan as it tends to bleed through after a couple of reuses.</li>
    <li> Set is wonderful. Wish it came with more strips though. But totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used this once and it works awesome. And delivery and great. Not damaged. And its easy and small enough for storage in small areas</li>
    <li> It works great all the time. I would recommend this one who is trying it first time. Thanks for making this product</li>
    <li> To be cut the first trick is looking cut right? So I bought this wax kit lol. I was a little skeptical about buying it because I didn&#x27;t know if it would remove the hair off my chest &amp; stomach, but turns out it did without a problem. Everything in the kit was great. The extra wax strips, spread sticks etc works great the pre wax, pre powder etc all work fantastically. Slow grow seems to work. Which those 4oz bottles were nice to try as a extra because I will definitely buy refills when they run out. Overall I would recommend this product to both men and woman. Also check out videos on youtube if your trying to wax for the first time. :) oh yeah again this product WORKS FOR GUYS TOOO! So yeahhhh. Lolll :)</li>
    <li> Great product, lid was broken so they gave a percentage refund.</li>
    <li> I had a friend help me with this..  Very easy to do.. Wax was a little gooey, but that&#x27;s to be expected.. I&#x27;ll continue to use this rather than dishing out $12-$15 all the time for a brow wax.</li>
    <li> Love this kit works great and came earlier than expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like the waxing instruments that are used in salons! The cost of this kit pays for itself after one use!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, the wax could smell better though. But all in all I am pleased with both the product and price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of waxes and this kit was simple to use. It didn&#x27;t hurt as badly as I had thought. This kit comes with everything you need.</li>
    <li> This kit was/is AMAZING!!!! I literally have &#x27;man&#x27; hair &amp; this wax kit was simple to use and worked GREAT! This was definitely a great buy. So ladies/men?, if you&#x27;re serious about getting rid of that unruly awful hair... HERE IT IS!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this starter kit for waxing, very easy to use. Wax melts in about 2 to 3 hours. The wax is just the right temperature. Very nice, no more messy microwave spill outs of wax for me...</li>
    <li> I love it. It will save me money.</li>
    <li> This kit is great! The only issue that could improve is that the wax comes through the strips and gets on your fingers. For everyone that writes a review about the wax getting everywhere, you have to know what you are doing. It takes a  small amount of wax and be careful with it. DUH it is going to be sticky. That is it&#x27;s job. I love this and it is going to save me a ton of money by doing it at home rather than paying a salon. As long as you take your time and are willing to practice, this is a GREAT product.</li>
    <li> I love this, it works great and if you get your eyebrows waxed much this is a must. It is a very good quality wax. This is probably the same set up you will see in most salons . The price is good also. The wax should last a while if your just doing eyes and small areas.</li>
    <li> Amazing product price was right on time to my door and could not ask for nothing better I thought the machine was small ad no is the big one pro machine used it already and that thing is no joke if you don&#x27;t know how to use it would burn you I ill recommend this product to anyone. It does miracles on the body if you hate hair.</li>
    <li> I have facial hair and other treatments do not work. This is the best way and now I feel like a woman in my own home :) works great and the products used before and after are great!!!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the great reviews on Amazon I wasn&#x27;t hesitant to try it. Besides At my local waxing place I always looked at the products they used example Brand, type of wax and strips . Let me begin by telling prospective buyers as soon as I turned on the wax It had that smell &amp;#34;if you wax your familiar with it&amp;#34; I instantly knew it would work and it did, now I can save myself $$$$$$ and not only that the time of always going to get waxed. It takes practice, for instance Im a righty so waxing my my right underarm to remove the strip with my left was a bit annoying but i got it….&lt;br /&gt;Must buy!!!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how professional this kit is.  Looks just like the ones in the nail salons.  Very easy to use and economical</li>
    <li> Love everything GIGI!</li>
    <li> This product was great shipping was fast and nothing was broken! Very good for the amount you pay! One thing one of the bottles was leaking but nothing big nor messy! Overall pretty decent if you want to DIY wax at home!</li>
    <li> I bought this to save myself time and money and wax my brows at home. It works great. Just be careful and go slow. Wax is hard to get off countertops.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this product.  I have saved so much money not having them professionally done.  It is so easy</li>
    <li> I was looking for, just a wax warmer and the only reason, i bought this kit- because it came with this whole extra thing. but let me tell you or i should say warn you about the wax and there products,  this wax is so hard to take off and even with the lotion that they send it still don&#x27;t come off , it was a big mess  at my place, its looks like highly chemical the smell is horrible, its good for the saloon purpose not in the house, So I ended up trashing the wax and the products the muslin strip doesn&#x27;t work well either, the thing starts getting all over the skin. the only extra stuff i will be using from that kit is the wax applicator. i should have just spent $20 warmer but oh well. I will be making my own wax and using the wax warmer, the warmer works great btw, that&#x27;s why you see 2 star :)</li>
    <li> I would have given this maybe five stars, but as others have said, the top &#x27;lid&#x27; of the unit arrived cracked.  Also, one of the bottles (&amp;#34;pre hon&amp;#34;) had either been previously used, or had somehow opened during shipping, as it had spilled all over the bottle.  The lid really isn&#x27;t that important--it doesn&#x27;t keep the wax from getting warm.  And there was still most of the liquid in the one aforementioned bottle.  The outside of the box seemed fine and the shipping container was in good shape, so I have to think that the lid is quite flimsy.  I&#x27;ve learned a couple of  very important things: 1.  Apply LOTS of the baby powder before waxing.  2.  Pull the strip ACROSS, NOT DIRECTLY AWAY from yourself.  I actually have a small bruise in one area because of this.  3.  Don&#x27;t use TOO much wax.  4.  It helps to remember to breathe...haha.  Because it is really quite painful.  I&#x27;d say on par with laser hair removal, except at least it&#x27;s one big ouch, instead of a million little ouches.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but came just as it was listed.  Was shipped UPS when I really prefer USPS.  Other than that it is fine.</li>
    <li> Some of the bottles seemed to be open and used...the warmer and wax are brand new though. The warmer is awesome and so is the wax.</li>
    <li> This Gigi kit was quite impressive! Since I&#x27;ve never done at home waxing before, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. It&#x27;s surprisingly easy and simple to pick up how to do it after you get the hang of it. The wax is a bit sticky and all over the can when you first get it. Though that was expected since it was trampling on the delivery here but it was it ok. The only problem was that it got all over my fingers when I tried to open the can. But easy fix because this kit come with a wax off and also other great things you might need on the waxing adventure. But overall, this kit is great and I recommend it to beginners and salon experts!</li>
    <li> The warmer works great but the muslin strips don&#x27;t work well enough for me. Still a great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice! I did purchase a roll of epilating strips from GiGi and I like them much better then muslin that came in the kit. The wax it came with is great and the warmer heats up in about 30 mins. Great investment!!</li>
    <li> What a difference a professional grade waxing kit makes!  At least twice before I&#x27;ve tried the cheap home wax kits you can buy in the store, and it was always disastrous.  But it irks me to pay someone $10 for an eyebrow wax when I could do it at home, so I gave this kit a try.  It seems to take forever for it all to melt, but it&#x27;s so much easier to use than the roll-on waxers, or the microwave variety.  As a non-salon-professional with unruly Italian eyebrows, I can&#x27;t recommend this kit enough.  Also, you don&#x27;t need to worry about buying more wax remover when you run out, plain old coconut oil works just as well (and with less chemicals).</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Good starter kit (comes with all you need). Want to try different wax though. Overall nothing wrong with product.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! EXACTLY WHAT WAS EXPECTED! DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE LOOKING FOR A WAX KIT. YOU WILL BE PLEASED. ..I WAS AT LEAST!</li>
    <li> easy to use and has everything you need to start with and was shipped pretty fast~ thought it was very useful for someone eho dont know how to ise it</li>
    <li> Takes about 30 minutes to warm up, but I usually do my waxing at the end of the day anyway, so I let it heat up while I am taking a shower.  Wish it had more cloth strips.</li>
    <li> This is great for occasional waxing at home. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s saved me a lot of money on waxing.</li>
    <li> Omg I love it me and my 2 besties use it all the time now no more going to get it done we just do it our selves</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I&#x27;ve done about 8 waxes so far and the product has paid for itself. Heats fast. This was a bargain with great quality</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Works perfectly! Perfect Description as well!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything they say but too hard for me to use and too pAinful for me to use I think I would rather try a professional</li>
    <li> Comes with nice size bottles, plenty of strips and applicators,  a large can of wax ~can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Everything you need to wax at home. You can literally pull it all out of the box, heat the wax &amp; be ready to wax in under 30 mins. The strips provided (large) were enough to do a half wax on both of my legs twice.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in perfect condition and has been. Real money saver. I have tried different kinds of waxes but. The gig I honey is my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> This is a great product easy to use with instructional DVD. Everything you need to get started home waxing is included in this kit. Would recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> the wax is so horribly sticky. And the strips are not so strong enough. I had to buy another set. But a big thumbs down for the sticky wax. It took me an hour to figure how to get rid of it. The remover given with the kit doesnt really help.</li>
    <li> This is cost effective and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Perfect kit for a beginner at home. Learning to do my own waxing, much more cost effective that going to the salon every 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I wax my own eyebrows and this product has been a life saver. I&#x27;ve been using this product constantly for 2 years and still have plenty of product. The only thing I&#x27;ve had to repurchase is the wax strips. Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was hoping that it would work good and I could stop going to the salon for waxing. No way!!! It isn&#x27;t worth buying.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could do my own Brazilian and underarm and sometimes Legs. I still find hair removal cream works best though. The hard wax it comes with is my go to wax. I bought a bunch of soft waxes and normal hard waxes and the Brazilian hard wax but I find this normal honey hard wax is best for Brazilian and underarm hair. Not so much for legs though...at all.</li>
    <li> Obessed with waxing! Way cheaper than sallys!</li>
    <li> Wax(all purpose honey) is extremely sticky that it wont come off.. took couple of days to get rid of wax on my skin.. I threw away wax and kept wax warmer hoping to find good wax..</li>
    <li> Great deal; met all my expectations and more!!!!</li>
    <li> It removes all the hair....&lt;br /&gt;But the wax is really sticky ,it took an hour to get rid of all this junk on my hands...</li>
    <li> Came just as said, no cracked lid like the other reviews say</li>
    <li> Everything was delivered rather quickly, and it was all packaged safely. It came in an amazon cardboard box, inside of another Gigi cardboard box. The plastic lid was wrapped in bubble plastic. I used it right away. The wax took about 35 minutes to melt and it wasn&#x27;t too sticky. I was happy that it came with one clean collar so it was all clean once I took it off. I would suggest wearing gloves while handling it though, because my fingers would stick together after awhile (even though I was wearing gloves, I had to change them every 15 minutes or so) after the powder and wax-off bottles run out, I would suggest just buying baby powder and baby oil.. With baby oil all of the left over wax came right off! Wasn&#x27;t even sticky. overall, a great buy! I saw this same kit on Sally&#x27;s website for like $55, so I bought it off of here. And it&#x27;s the same exact thing! I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> This kit doesn&#x27;t work. It got great reviews, and I had watched numerous YouTube videos before buying it. It totally ripped my underarm skin right off. I was SO careful not to get wax anywhere but I couldn&#x27;t get it off of my underarms! The wax remover that came in the kit was worthless, as were the other products. I ended up using my Sally Hansen Azulene Finishing Oil to help neutralize the wax and the ripped off skin. And because of the way this product is shipped, I can&#x27;t return it. I&#x27;ll stick to my Sally Hansen wax strips. They don&#x27;t work on underarms, unfortunately, which is why I bought this kit. But they work great on facial hair, eyebrows, upper lip, etc. I&#x27;d be SO scared to use this product on my face, thank goodness I started w/ my underarms where no-one can see the damage, and it will eventually heal. Looks like I&#x27;m stuck paying ridiculous amounts of money for salon underarm waxing going forward.</li>
    <li> Works very well, but i do recommend getting better waxing strips as the one that are included are not that great.</li>
    <li> I have used the hard wax in small pots that you microwave in the past, as well as medium sot waxes with strips. However, I found that the hard wax does not always get very small fine hairs around my eyebrows, as thoroughly as softer waxes that require a strip to remove. So I tried this kit as it was not too large, I thought. The white heating unit is HUGE on my counter top, and it&#x27;s awkward shape is going to take up a lot of space under my already crowded sink cabinet. The honey wax, is horrible. It does get the job done, but what a mess. It is not even as thick as real honey, and is more like trying to apply heated syrup. Which dripped all over my counter top, and the white unit, and some even accidentally dropped down my cleavage area while I was raising the applicator up to my face. That was a hot surprise, but explains why the instruction booklet has very descriptive instructions for getting this goo out of eyelashes as well:)  Unlike hard wax, which hardens quickly and can be flaked off, this stuff is like trying to clean up syrup. The post wax lotion was useless, but I realized it smelled a bit like coconut, so I tried the straight coconut oil I use for sautéing and it worked like a dream. This stuff does work, but given the mess, the number of strips it takes trying to get excess wax up,  cleaning my bathroom afterwards, and the large unit- I much prefer the hard wax in microwaveable pots. It is not nearly as messy, and I will not have the continuous expense of buying strips and the applicator sticks. Which by the way, with hard wax I used the one stick for an entire pot, as you could always just snap it off. The wood applicator sticks with this are a one time use proposition as the honey wax makes it impossible  to store or use them a second time. As I am stuck with this unit, I will try the hard wax and see if it is any better.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my niece and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife after she accidentally dropped her last kit on the carpet. I liked that this one came with a warmer, so she didn&#x27;t have to put it in the microwave and make a mess again. She really loves this kit and has been excitingly using it ever since she got it!</li>
    <li> Great product, however, even on the lowest setting it is a bit too hot for my 14-year-old daughter. Just purchased the creme wax in hopes that it melt at a lower temperature.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to try a waxing kit that would last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I was used to buying the pre-waxing strips, but this works a whole lot better.&lt;br /&gt;I had already purchased one from Sally&#x27;s and tried it at home, it worked so I returned it and bought this one, which is the exact same model, only you get the wax, sticks, muslin, and the extra bottles of various things included at a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;Like I read in other reviews, it takes a while to heat up ~30-40min on high, then you have to turn down the heat either low or medium. It worked the same as the one I had previously bought.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying the muslin at a fabric store because it cheaper and the sticks at a craft store in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;Those cardboard rings help keep it clean, you can trace the shape on any thin cardboard material and have many rings rather than buying more.&lt;br /&gt;To replace those bottles when they run out, I bought baby powder and baby oil, since they work just as fine.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone as an option to get rid of hair and have a product that will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe everything that came with it for the price!! I love using it and have had it for a while now. I ended up buying the sensitive wax as well and suggest that for first timers or for other areas..</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. End of story.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I enjoy waxing  in the privacy  of my home.  Best of all I get to save more money!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and it came in faster then the expected date:)</li>
    <li> my lid was not cracked .</li>
    <li> No complaints at all...Got exactly what I ordered, good quality! I&#x27;ve always used the Gigi All Purpose Honee and it&#x27;s totally satisfactory!</li>
    <li> too messy to do by yourself trust me</li>
    <li> My kit aRevived today everything is great just my cover is cracked.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once and on my face but it worked really well and is easy to use.  It does take awhile to warm up.  I kept stirring and stirring but you really have to give it all of 20-30 minutes for the warm up.  Based on other reviews I used the cardboard collar provided to cut our other collars from card stock that I had on hand. after I finished I simply let it cool overnight and packed it away for next time.  I do recommend this product for personal use.</li>
    <li> I loved this kit. It has everything you need and works great.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all in Humid environments. Absolute waste of money and was attempted several times.</li>
    <li> saved me hundreds and keeps my wife;s beaver silky smooth</li>
    <li> Excellent kit and I like that is warm the wax very fast and over all nice kit I recommend this item</li>
    <li> This is a good kit for anyone just trying out waxing. I love that it comes with so much and it is at a great price.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and works great, but it&#x27;s so dang messy...and good luck getting any leftover wax off your skin!</li>
    <li> I recieved this item on time but when I plugged it in and put the wax in it, it did not heat the wax. The lights came on so it was getting power, but the wax warmer never warmed up at all. I left it on for an hour and finally took the wax out and put my hand inside to see if it was warm at all and it was ICE COLD!! I sent mine back for a full refund!</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time and I love it! Easy to use and very cost effective. This will pay for itself in a couple of months and no more going to the salon to get my eyebrows done.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but after 2 weeks something happened to wax container inside, and wax came out all over the outside of the heater, also the lid cracked after 3 days of using. This is the second one was I&#x27;ve had of this brand. No problems,with the first. And they won&#x27;t let u return it.</li>
    <li> i must be using it wrong because my coarser hair do not come out even if i let the hair grow a quarter inch first.</li>
    <li> Works great, no complains</li>
    <li> Arrived with a CRACKED LID! And the wax is SUPER STICKY and the wax off doesn’t remove the wax at all.</li>
    <li> Great price and product</li>
    <li> The waxing strips didn&#x27;t work very well so just keep in mind you will have to buy better ones , but overall great product and the delivery was quick !!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. There is easy access to supplies at Sally&#x27;s and it&#x27;s very convenient portably product. The shipping was fast and the product was perfect when it arrived</li>
    <li> Love this!! I don&#x27;t use much the bottles that came with it but the wax and wax machine itself are wonderful!!! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying any wax product thru anyone - i figured they were all failures. However, i love this little guy! The warmer is easy to use the honee wax is perfect for my skin and the lotion bottles that came with this kit was very useful. I will def be buying more cloth strips and lotion bottles going forward. Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for a 4 out of 5 was the lid to the wax cracked with the took it off for the first time. Therefore, if i ever need to transport it to i don&#x27;t have a tight lid on the wax to prevent slipping.</li>
    <li> It is too big and cumbersome and you have to buy all supplies extra. The discription does not tell you that. I am going to return this.</li>
    <li> Just as description states and its perfect. SO much cheaper than buying things individually too!&lt;br /&gt;Not for newbies.. You should know how to use wax if you want to invest in this..</li>
    <li> The kit in general is good. The heater works well, but the wax removal that you are sent in the kit barely takes the wax off you. it very messy so be ready to get dirty. I was also sent \\&quot;post epillation powder\\&quot; which is really just baby powder. It doesn&#x27;t do anything. I wish they sent me \\&quot;post wax cooling gel\\&quot; which is a miracle and I wouldn&#x27;t have written a bad review. No matter how you do it, wax will take off a thin layer of skin which is why you become all red. You need to cool it down and get vitamins back in. I used to used aloe but i would be red for days. They my hairdresser told me about the gel. It is amazing, the redness goes away, and the wax is really effective. I have very very sensitive skin for anyone with questions on that and waxing.</li>
    <li> seriously love this! Best investment I have made. You&#x27;ll have to get more cloth strips before you run out of the wax. You can switch the wax to  use hard wax,which is  great. Make sure you let wax warm up on high for at least 2 hours before using. I love that you get all the bottle for before and after waxing. Its a steal for the price! The wax is sticky but thats expected with ANY wax. I wouldn&#x27;t say its more sticky than others. There was nothing wrong with it when i got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I would make sure you read and watch tutorials if you&#x27;ve never done this on your own. Know you&#x27;re skin type to make sure you get the temperature right.</li>
    <li> I like it but I wish it would heat up faster.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up&lt;br /&gt;comes with everything you need to practice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: the eyebrow strips are really big so you have to cut them down</li>
    <li> This was defective. The light that was supposed to come on when it reached the desired temperature came on as soon as I plugged it in.  And, the wax never seemed to get warm enough. I wanted to return it but was not allowed, said it was hazardous materials. Which made me wonder, how were they able to ship it to me??  I threw it out.  In my opinion, total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! If you&#x27;re like me and were having a hard time deciding on what wax pot kit to get, get this one! it has everything in it that you need for a great price :) I just ordered a set of clean collars on the side, because this one only comes with one. couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice having a kit with everything included. Maybe I&#x27;m just used to the wax from India, but this wax was impossible to get off when I was finished and trying to clean up, even with the small bottle that was given for removal.</li>
    <li> Just love it. Easy and practical. I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> lid was broken when open the box. Product works well, great price!</li>
    <li> I give the warmer 5 stars for sure, and the cloth strips are great as well, but the bottles of stuff and the wax are all worthless. The wax remover cream doesn&#x27;t work, just use Vaseline. The pre-wax cleanser is ok but baby oil works just as well. The pre-wax powder is just plain old baby powder. Just buy the warmer by itself and buy the cloth strips and wax separately. The Honee hard wax is vastly superior to the soft wax that comes with this kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit so I could wax myself instead of spending all that money at the salon. It does exactly what I need and good quality for the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gigi&#x27;s microwave creme wax for years but it began to get to messy. Gigi&#x27;s is the only brand that has not broken me out...ever! I needed to order more and decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m so happy I did! I actually like the honey wax that this kit comes with more than the creme one that I used before, it seems to get more of the shorter hairs on my brows. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my body only lip and brows. If you are on the fence about this, please give it a try ... you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> Great deal. I&#x27;ve bought two now, one for me and one for a gift. Much cheaper buying this student kit than seoerately.</li>
    <li> I bought this for waxing my under arms. I liked that it came with everything you need for waxing but it was messy and left waxed area feeling sticky. I would recommend hard wax if this is something you are planning on doing.</li>
    <li> She used only two times</li>
    <li> I like it it was my first time waxing by my self and this kit had everything you need</li>
    <li> Wife liked it... The stuff is super sticky</li>
    <li> Completely conquered my unsightly facial hair! Thank goodness! I also waxed my husband&#x27;s unibrow and it got rid of that sucker in one pull!</li>
    <li> Great product. Just make sure you don&#x27;t make the rookie mistake I did and get wax on the bathroom counter (still looking for a good way to remove it!)</li>
    <li> Arrived before I exspected and was everything it was suppost to be.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product, and would recommend to anyone, as the price is great and you get a lot of items. However, the only reason I am giving 3 starts instead of 5 is the wax must have been sitting on its side when it was shipped so the lid was stuck to the wax. It was a mess to get the lid off. I was able to get the lid off, but the lid still has so much wax on it, this issue will continue. I will have to toss the wax and buy new, but other than that little issue. I would highlighly recommend.</li>
    <li> same set that is in the salons...I can save money and time....great set to own.....</li>
    <li> I hate this product. Don&#x27;t buy this for free also...</li>
    <li> Very timely. Great product</li>
    <li> This kit is amazing.  Highly recommend it!  I have bought cheap store brand was stripes and it hurt like non other!!!  Do not waste your time, money or skin!  Ripping hair from your body will hurt, however, this kit has added some extras to sooth those problems over.</li>
    <li> I think the heater is ok, but the products that come with it are not worth anything. Impossible for clean up. Moom is a lot easier.</li>
    <li> I already had one but bought this one as a gift for my sister. I am not an expert on waxing so I am unaware if there is a better waxing system out there or what to look for in a waxing kit. But for the price and the need results I was looking for, this product worked for me.</li>
    <li> Came packaged great and fast shipping. I am satisfied (:</li>
    <li> Warmer works great but wax sucks. It&#x27;s that sticky honey texture wax that only works on longer fine hair. Also as this  is a student kit I expected some kind of directions for waxing different areas of the body but there were NO directions in my kit.</li>
    <li> Life saving kit .. Totally great stuff ..</li>
    <li> I bought a Gigi product before so when my first one finally died,i bought another one but when i received it the cover was cracked.  So sad.</li>
    <li> all well but plucking fabric was not very good tube to ask again for depilatory paper that came in the kit that was not good</li>
    <li> a must have! I love this</li>
    <li> Good kit. Everything necessary is included. The only problem was that there were few muslin strips, I ran out of them before anything else.</li>
    <li> great kit and easy to use. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> The wax didn&#x27;t take off my course hair very good so I bought some mor waxes. I liked the silky smooth for course hair the best. The wax remover with the kit did not take the silky smooth off very good.  The pre-hon and pre-powder worked fine. The wax warmer is excellent. I think I like the regular epilating cloths I bought separate better than the muslim cloths that came with the kit. I recommend the kit for beginners because the wax warmer is fine. You will need to buy more sticks and wax can rings if you do more than your legs once if you don&#x27;t double dip. I did not like the cold wax I bought from Gigi.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far, the wax seems to be lasting a very long time. Follow the instructions and you should be able to receive near salon-quality results at home for less than the price of one visit. I waxed both thighs, bikini area, and abdomen and the amount of wax in the jar has barely gone down. I&#x27;ve found that the linen strips can be used two or three times over after so that&#x27;s great because I hate wasting things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised at how short my hair could be for this kit to work well. A few of the places I waxed had hair as short as 1/16&amp;#34; and this kit worked marvelously! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying refills in the future!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and very effective.</li>
    <li> This waxing kit is quite nice with everything you need from start to finish at a decent price.  The honee wax worked much better than the Sally&#x27;s I had been using, and the warmer made it easy to keep going without a run to the microwave to warm cooled wax.  That said, it loses a star due to the persistent stickiness.  It leaked through the muslin strips, and the included wax-off was not very efficient as a remover.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this kit.  But the wax warmer came in cracked and there is no return/exchange policy.</li>
    <li> Everything you need to DIY! Excellent price and I&#x27;ve already ordered a second one. What you spend once to buy it is the same as 1 trip to the day spa. Well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wife is happy, so I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this product and when it arrived it wasn&#x27;t damaged and everything was intact. I was so happy and had no complains with the packaging. Moving on to the products, the bottles that it included were alright but the wax off doesn&#x27;t really do it. I would buy something better or use baby oil. The wax warmer itself heats up fairly quickly and does it&#x27;s job of heating. So far not so many complains. The muslin strips aren&#x27;t great they are more of the cheap side and I personally would never use them because when you do use them the wax goes through. Now here is my biggest disappointment , the wax itself was a sticky mess! It didn&#x27;t pull any hairs out! Not did it want to come off. Not only that but when I was succesful in taking it off it left me a black shadow/scar in the areas I waxed. It&#x27;s been monthes and it hasn&#x27;t come off. I&#x27;m very disappointed. Don&#x27;t use the wax .</li>
    <li> I completely loved this kit. It is so easy to use (though i already knew the basics of waxing), does not stick here and there, pain free and the whole process is very smooth. I liked each and every product of this kit. I would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Five stars!  I absolutely love this product.  It has every single thing that you need.  This is for a professional, student, or even just a regular person.  You are given tips and it includes a dvd.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The Package was good and has everything I needed. The Honee was a little sticky though, next time perhaps get another type of wax, creme wax perhaps. Also it came with the muslin strips they kept making a mess due to all the threads, buying the Cloth Epilating Strips next time once I finish what I have</li>
    <li> I love my kit I will always by from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s works pretty well except the wax off. That needs to improve. Get some baby oil guys or the wax isn&#x27;t coming off.</li>
    <li> This product has worked great so far and I have no complaints with the warmers, but for some reason the tube of wax which came in the kit leaks.... I&#x27;m assuming this isn&#x27;t a normal occurrence. When placed in the heater, from the bottom of the can, wax started seeping out the bottom edges and I have a big puddle of wax in the bottom of the warmer which now needs to be cleaned out.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used it yet because it has an European outlet... Description says nothing about it and it only ships with the US.  Now I have to attempt to get a converter to see if that will work.  If not, it&#x27;s being returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annoyed and disappointed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great, and smells amazing</li>
    <li> The wax its digusting the warmer its to big the strips loose some fabric around i didnt like the product at all</li>
    <li> So easy to use; clean and simple. Love the lotions, powders that come with the kit.</li>
    <li> Love the product &amp; all the accessories that come with it.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described. The warmer works perfectly and I love the whole kit!</li>
    <li> It was messy and took hours and hours to bee liquid enough to even start. I would not recommend the honey.</li>
    <li> nice product....  my waxing experiance has changed in a good way.</li>
    <li> Good deal for great products! I wax my whole body and this wax works everywhere, the water is fast and it comes with everything pictured.</li>
    <li> The kit is amazing! However I received a broken lid in my package which was pretty disappointing...</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this brand of wax to me. It is a very good wax but I will definately need more practice. This was my first time using wax on myself and it turned out to be a big mess. The first application went well though.</li>
    <li> it sucked ! regret buying this product, was not easy to use and got all over my fingers! and yes i was careful and still got all over the place. the wax off SUCK! this whole product sucks!</li>
    <li> Kit contains everything I need to do facial waxing at home for my daughter and myself.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Came with everything you need to wax yourself at home. Not sure why it&#x27;s called a student kit, but great price for all this stuff. Very happy</li>
    <li> I have never waxed before I ordered this kit. I followed the directions and I must say, this is a life saver!</li>
    <li> Came with the dome transparent lid broken :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> The strips are too thin. Makes your hands sticky when smoothing on. Overall I like the kit though.</li>
    <li> Product is better than described, this is great to not have to spend between 8-10 dollars every time I want my eyebrows done, and having 2 daughters, this lets me do theirs also.</li>
    <li> This looked exactely like the picture shown. Shipping was fast, nothing was broken, and it  came with a lot of items :)</li>
    <li> So Far So Good. Great item for a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a good wax kit if you&#x27;re starting with nothing. The wax is not for Brazilian waxing so you may have trouble on super thick hair. Over all, good buy for the money. You can always buy another tub of wax and still come out on top for the price.</li>
    <li> Worked just like going to the salon</li>
    <li> Omg horrible  horrible  horrible  it was a hudge mess it&#x27;s getting  returned  big waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. very happy with it!</li>
    <li> best product ever... great price. The added slow grow cream works like a charm too</li>
    <li> have one of these back home that my aunt was throwing out and I&#x27;m glad I snatched it before she did It&#x27;s been holding up fpr over 2 years now and it&#x27;s not done yet. I mainly use it to wax my legs back home and get my lip and nikini professionally done. I needed one for here at college. Such a useful kit when I don&#x27;t feel to spend $30+ for waxes when I could spend the equivalent on a wax kit that I can use multiple times. I didn&#x27;t really need the bottles that came with it because I usually just use baby oil to wipe off the excess wax and cooling gel. I wish they included the cooling gel so i didn&#x27;t have to buy it separate but buying the set and the cooling gel came out cheaper than buying everything individually. I like how the honey wax doesn&#x27;t hurt unlike this pink opaque one i use back home (aso a gigi product) The one I have back home is finishing so I&#x27;ll just order the honey to carry back.</li>
    <li> I have used this product only once, but it has been great! It heated up the wax quickly and worked perfectly. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great quality and price!</li>
    <li> Love the product but sad the lid came broken.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived with a CRACKED lid fresh out of the box!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Salon quality.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re just starting out waxing, this is a really good kit. I don&#x27;t use it as often as I used to (I&#x27;m a pansy when it comes to pain), but it works really well. I&#x27;m glad it comes with the wax warmer; I don&#x27;t even want to think of how hard it would be to warm the wax on the stove or in the microwave. I&#x27;d end up waxing in the kitchen! I highly recommend this kit. Ps, I&#x27;m not a robot.</li>
    <li> The warmer was fine the wax is no good it&#x27;s very sticky it didn&#x27;t remove hair that good and it&#x27;s messy I will never purchase Gigi wax no more very cheap</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching several reviews on youtube. I wanted to go with the satin smooth system but saw such great reviews on the Gigi and it was more affordable. Works great just feel like I need a little more practice and would like to try a variety of waxes. Hoping I can use different brands of wax in this system. But overall its great!</li>
    <li> Great wax kit without having to be too pricey. Works perfect for quick wax jobs, but can be used for bigger ones as well. Love the accessories that came with it.</li>
    <li> great kit every woman or man should have one.</li>
    <li> I have found this kit to have all things that I need; however, it is incredibly messy.  One of the first times I used it, I got wax all over one of my bathroom rugs and was able to use a very hot iron to get it out (great discovery).  I am not sure what component I&#x27;m allergic to, but I seem to be allergic to one of the contents of this kit--either the wax itself or the wax remover.  I have found I need to shower after waxing to reduce the burning reaction that occurs.  Thus, I will be investing in alternative waxes (and wax removers) shortly.</li>
    <li> Love this kit! It&#x27;s great for beginners like me. The wax given works really well and the warmer heats it up evenly in about 5-10 minutes. My only complaint would be the Wax Off doesn&#x27;t work very great so definitely go buy some baby oil, it works!</li>
    <li> I am not a student, I absolutely love this GIGI starter kit. I have had it since July and use it about once per month. The only thing i don&#x27;t care for are the strips that come with it, The wax seeps through a little and gets on your hands. They work great, but that is the only dislike that I have about this product. The kit comes with applicators, wax, wax warmer, wax strips, wax remover, prep lotion, Prep drying powder, wax remover lotion, and lotion for afterwards that reduces hair re-growth.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. Took some practice, but now I am pretty good with it!</li>
    <li> I think the kit itself is good. Bracing yourself to rip off your hair is kind of difficult, but once you get the hang it&#x27;s ok (not everyone might be able to inflict waxing pain on themselves though, know what you&#x27;re getting into!). I had an allergic reaction to the wax and my eyebrow was red for 3 days! The wax off wasn&#x27;t great, I ended up using hawaiian tropic tanning oil to get the bits remaining. I think I may purchase another type of wax and try again.</li>
    <li> I recently received my Gigi Student Starter Kit, and the kit came as advertised. The pot worked and melted my hard wax within 30-45 minutes. The only reason I did not give this kit 5 stars is because it comes with a REALLY old and out dated DVD and also the lid to my Gigi Warmer was cracked, almost in half.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter. She we pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase, it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
    <li> Works good on legs. Hard a difficult time removing bikini line hair but I&#x27;m inexperienced so it could be me. Overall good product</li>
    <li> Definitely save you money and I love to honey wax</li>
    <li> FOLLOW the directions! LOL LOL LOL  I LOVE this home waxing kit!  Saves me $$ from going to the local salon.</li>
    <li> Stay away if you are not a professional. My wife ordered this and she ended up with wax residue all over her skin. She struggled for almost 4 hours to get rid of it. At the end, she has skin with bruises :( So, please don&#x27;t buy this as an experiment.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and that&#x27;s about the only good thing I can say about it. The plastic dome lid was cracked upon arrival even though it was wrapped in bubble wrap and the box was undamaged. Out of the 4 bottles of product 2 had lids partially unscrewed so they had leaked all over the other bottles however there was no product on the box which leads me to believe that these items were intentionally packed this way.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when the package containing my wax kit was delivered that I dropped everything to try it out.  I immediately plugged it in and put it to work.  It didn&#x27;t even take 30 minutes to melt the wax and I was on my way to wax my eyebrows and upper lip.  This is the first time I have ever self-waxed, so I tried to take it slow around my &#x27;brows (I would have never heard the end of it from my husband if I would have waxed them into a funny shape or worse) and it took me quite a few applications but they came out just as good if not better than if I had done it at a salon (EVERY time, no matter what salon I went too, in five different states, I always come home and find stray hairs that should have been removed and weren&#x27;t).  I did my upper lip and that turned out as well (kind of hard to screw that one up unless you burn yourself).  I left the warmer on the high setting, and it did not seem like it would burn at all.  I didn&#x27;t want to put my new &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; away, so I went ahead and did my armpits as well.  Which worked great.  I was excited and not being extremely cautious about where the wax go, so the next round I will take my time and try not to get wax everywhere.  I would recommend buying extra of the Gigi Wax Off lotion, it definitely helps removing residual wax.  I got the student kit, although I originally tried to order the mini pro, but for some reason they wouldn&#x27;t ship the mini pro to interior Alaska (where I live currently) but the would ship the student kit. I&#x27;ve lived here for six years so I&#x27;m used to that kind of thing. I would definitely recommend getting either kit if one is interested in waxing at home.</li>
    <li> dont buy from them the item came cracked and its not eligible for return.  Read the fine print don&#x27;t be like me.</li>
    <li> Great thanks! Love this Product easy to use. Would recommend to anyone don&#x27;t have to be a professional to use this.</li>
    <li> It is a Christmas gift. I bet we are all going to get our eyebrows done on Christmas Day! I know she&#x27;s will love it. It is exactly what they use in the salon and pay 15.00 for. Not anymore!</li>
    <li> Best investment ever.  I was worried about waxing at home (myself!)  But the wax is very gentle and the unit easy to use.  All the extra lotions/power and wax remover comes in handy for this novice.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> Great kit. I have had very limited experience waxing at home. This was easy to use and everything I needed was included. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The wax sticks too much and doesnt come off</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a wax for quite some time but never had the guts to go to a salon. I finally decided to look for a diy waxing kit and after comparing several products and reading over reviews, chose this one. Best decision ever! This kit works for armpits, arms, legs, and bikini waxes.&lt;br /&gt;The kit is perfect for beginners but a couple of things to take note of:&lt;br /&gt;-The wax warmer works great but can take some time (about 15-20 minutes for me) to heat up the wax.&lt;br /&gt;-There is a slight odor from the wax but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;-The wax is very sticky and can get very messy! So make sure you are naked and have something underneath your work space because the wax is very hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;-The muslin strips are not that strong. They do not catch the wax very well when your hair is long and will just cause unnecessary pain.&lt;br /&gt;-The Wax-Off they give you to remove the wax after you&#x27;re done is not effective. You need large amounts of it to rub off excess wax. I would recommend using warm water and baby oil instead to remove excess wax.&lt;br /&gt;Other than those things, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! it came perfectly, worth every peny</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Plastic lid arrived cracked.&lt;br /&gt;still usable.</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING starter set! I have waxed everything! I have never waxed my armpits before, I will probably never do that again. But, for the price of this set and the amount of waxing you can do right away! It&#x27;s a steal! I will say that I reuse the sticks that use for my face and not-too-personal skin areas. This saves quite a bit of material, and as I am the only one using the wax, I&#x27;m not contaminating anyone with my &amp;#34;cooties&amp;#34;. So far, I have waxed my eyebrows twice, upper lip and chin twice, trail twice, arm pits and have done the nether regions once with excellent success! What I could have easily spent well over $100 on at a salon, I spent $35 to do at home! I do agree that if you are not able to lean over a counter to do your waxing, it would be important to lay down a towel for dripping wax.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this. comes with a lot of stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazing, thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have bought this set before in the stores so I knew what to expect. When I opened  my package I noticed the wax in this kit was a much better quality then the one I had previously purchased in the store awhile back, the bottles of cleanser, powder, wax removal, and slow grow were all bigger in this kit as well. This kit is well worth the price and I received it earlier then expected. A definite recommend!!!</li>
    <li> My machine wouldn&#x27;t even turn on! No lights, nothing. Gave it the benefit of the doubt and plugged it in for 30 minutes, nothing. I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that I can return this because I wasted $40.</li>
    <li> I have gone to the spa, and gotten my eyebrows waxed, and it was painless. I never got my upper lip waxed, but my sister did there, and it made her eyes water. I used this kit, and followed the instructions and everywhere i waxed was practically painless! I waxed between my eyebrows, my upper lip, and my armpits, which actually did hurt a little, but it was way better than shaving for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that was a HUGE pain was when I got the wax, because it had been shipped, the wax was all on one side, and it was almost impossible to get the lid off, I had to fight it for about half an hour, but if I had been more patient, I bet the wax would&#x27;ve settled correctly eventually.</li>
    <li> Prefect. I was happy to see the box was not damaged. Just how I remember using a wax kit in high school cosmetology.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because of a good Amazon review and i&#x27;m not disappointed at all! The wax got heat up at the right temperature.. no more burning my husband when i wax his eye brows. I did throw away the cloth strip like other reviewers suggested and bought a different one on Amazon in the same shipment.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I dont like is that it&#x27;s very messy. I got wax everywhere... (couch and rugs). It seems like there&#x27;s no better way of handling it.. no one to blame but me.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I gave it a 4 because I really like it and it work real good. I am willing to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Delivered earlier than expected...the only issue I have is the the cover is cracked. I also thought I purchased the mini..this one is kind of big seeing that I dont have much room in my bathroom..still a good product used it many times before</li>
    <li> The kit was incomplete when opened. It was missing the cloth strips and sticks.  I didn&#x27;t notice it until after i took the top off the wax. So I could not return it.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Would not heat the wax at all</li>
    <li> I am a professional cosmetologist and bought this for at home use.  Came with everything listed and was a great value as a starter.  My order arrived in great condition and on time.  I have recommended to others.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It truly is professional quality. I have bought other wax kits and was never happy with the results. THIS is what I was looking for all along! So happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Great for first timers. Follow instructions and work&#x27;s great. Need to order more wax though</li>
    <li> Great, I just have to learn how to use it correctly</li>
    <li> I love this thing but the wax seems a bit harsh. It is so hard to get off the skin even with the wax off, warm soap and water, an extra cloth...its just so messy. It does work though and I cant believe it is so cheap. Would recommend</li>
    <li> This kit is amazing! and for $32 its a bargain! It works perfectly. We use it all the time we just buy different replacement waxes. this kit is defintely a lot cheaper than buying eveyrthing seprately.</li>
    <li> Accurate description and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic kit! You get so much for your money and it heats the wax to the perfect temperature.</li>
    <li> Horrid.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying I&#x27;ve never waxed before, I&#x27;ve just used wax at the salon for my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I first read the instructions and watch some tutorial videos Gigi has available, decided to go for this kit that supposedly had everything I needed. Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;The written instructions are very confusing, they tell you to put the &amp;#34;collars&amp;#34; in the warmer. There is no collar in this kit, the collars are sold separately and only knew what they were after investigating. If you&#x27;re going to go forth with this product, immediately get the collars to avoid a mess in your warmer.&lt;br /&gt;If you have very sensitive skin, this is not for you. I used it on my legs with all the  products this kit has to prep the skin before... and it left me with HUGE red bumps all over that were extremely itchy. It took half an hour for them to come down.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my eyebrows and &amp;#34;mustache area&amp;#34;, where the hair is slightly thinner and longer with no problem, but it did nothing in regions where the hair is shorter and thicker like the armpits... not a single hair came off, and I don&#x27;t feel like letting my armpit and leg hair grow for a week to be able to wax it... I thought this product was different.&lt;br /&gt;I also absolutely hate the &amp;#34;wax off&amp;#34; product... it doesn&#x27;t effectively removes the left over wax, using baby oil is way better.</li>
    <li> The waxing warmer on and off switch came out the second time we used it. Had to put the screw back in and tighten it up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth it!! I  have saved so much money on waxing.</li>
    <li> i got this waxing starter kit and I tried it out last week. The time to warm the wax is reasonable and the consistency is great! The only downside are the spreading sticks that come with the kit. They are a bit flimsy and easy to break , but overall I&#x27;m really happy!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was relly iffy about doing this but also really excited. It worked fine on my legs. It&#x27;s super messy and the Wax Off remover didn&#x27;t work. It basically smoothed out the wax all over my leg. When I got to under my arms, I thought it would work the same way, but I was very wrong. The wax quality wasnt good enough to pull the hair out. Not only that, but after ripping thewax strip off, I was burning and my skin was red and in so much pain. I have a high pain tolerance all over my body, especially my legs, under arms, and downtown area. This had me bawling on the floor. I will never buy this cheap crap again, it was NOT worth it, and I want to throw it away. However, this will not stop me from buying a different and better product, because the wax warmer came in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Saves time and money. Worth my money and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My Gigi Student Starter Kit came today.  I just finished waxing my arms about a half an hour ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being of French, Italian, and Indian descent, I sometimes look at my arms and find myself wondering if I&#x27;m a woman or a bear.  I got them waxed a couple of times at a salon, but $38 plus a tip is too steep an expense for a broke college student to incur every four weeks.  So I switched to using those pre-waxed strips you can buy at the drug store.  Very convenient, but not cost effective; these gorilla limbs take a box apiece, racking up a bill between $22 and $27 per round.  Still not cutting it.  And then, there&#x27;s this kit, which, as of this writing, costs just $35 AND comes with all the stuff I need to be waxing for a good three months or so.  All this for less than the cost of one professional wax?  That&#x27;s an automatic five stars in my book.  But for the record, here are the highlights of what I noticed while using this tonight:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- First, the wax took closer to an hour to completely liquefy.  Maybe it&#x27;s just that my house was cold, but the package claims the wax should be melted in 25 to 30 minutes.  Not that it really matters, though.  It&#x27;s not as though you can wax last-minute, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Other reviewers said they had problems with the muslin strips tearing on them.  While I did not have this experience, I much prefer the cloth (non-woven) strips I tried after the large muslin ones ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I highly recommend ordering more waxing strips wile you&#x27;re ordering this kit.  Even if you don&#x27;t struggle with GLS (gorilla limb syndrome) like me, you&#x27;ll want more strips to make it through your learning curve.  Since this was my first time waxing myself with soft wax, I wasn&#x27;t exactly economical with the strips and ran out halfway through my second arm.  But I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with this with enough practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Yeah, it&#x27;s messy, but the mess can be minimized (if not eliminated) with preparation and careful handling.To protect my tabletop, I cut a trash bag along one side and the bottom to make myself a disposable and effective work surface.  (Eat your heart out, Pinterest.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Be aware of your pain tolerance, and be careful of how much wax you smear on yourself at one time.  One of the perks of waxing at home is being able to remove large patches of hair at a time, as you&#x27;re not being treated by an aesthetician who&#x27;s been trained to handle you delicately.  But know the difference between &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;too large.&amp;#34;  At one point, I got too ambitious and wound up flubbing as I tried to tried to remove a large strip that was almost completely saturated in wax.  I saw stars on that one--and gave myself a nice bruise right above the elbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most of my complaints I consider quibbles, as I really do believe this is the most cost-effective way to wax.  Judging from the amount of wax still left in the can, I&#x27;m confident I can get another 6 or 7 treatments out of one tub.</li>
    <li> I ordered this about 3 days ago and it&#x27;s already here! Very fast shipping so I was happy about that first off. I had been using the microwaveable moom sugar wax which isn&#x27;t bad at all just wanted something that was maybe easier to use. I love all the extras that this came with too! Especially the one that you put on after you get done waxing to keep hair from growing back fast. It came with plenty of wax strips but be forewarned if you&#x27;ve used sugar wax before you know that you can reuse the strips. Not with this one. But that&#x27;s not a big deal since I&#x27;m sure you could cut up old t-shirts. Or buy more at Sally&#x27;s/Amazon. The thing I liked the most is that since it comes with a wax warmer you never have to worry about it being the correct consistency unlike the microwave kind. Everyone says they smell a plasticy scent from the wax but it&#x27;s actually from the warmer. It says in the directions that it&#x27;s perfectly normal. So the wax actually has no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;I waxed my sisters and my arms and still have lots of product left for more uses. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase. I will continue buying the wax refills and try out the different types. Buy this! You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Gigi student starter kit.  It arrived earlier than expected.  It comes with the all purpose honey wax, small, and large muslin strips, small, medium and large wooden sticks, the  cleanser, powder, wax remover and  growth inhibitor, a Dvd and of course, the wax heater. You get just enough supplies  to get you started.  It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great starter kit for my daughter</li>
    <li> Ive been an online shopper for a while now and never have I left a review.  But this is a good buy im pleased when I 1st open the package I noticed the top was in 2 pieces but I used it used  anyway took longer then said to heat and melt wax it took about a hour hour and a half.  I used gigi hard wax I bought hard and soft. It was dummy prof 1st time waxer I was able to give myself a bikini was arms  and legs so much cheaper and convenient them the shop</li>
    <li> I love the warmer.  It does a great job in warming the wax. The wax that comes with this kit is very messy so be careful with it. It is very sticky and stringy. I made the mistake of spilling it all over my floor and 1 month later there is still a sticky residue that is difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> Wax strips suck everything seems cheap though it&#x27;s expensive...</li>
    <li> I really like this kit. I had never done waxing on myself  or other I would always go get iit professionally Done. The only the only thing I recommend is to also buy the circle thing that goes around the heating thing so you won&#x27;t get it messy with waxs</li>
    <li> all you will need as a student starter, my experience waxing as a novice was fine and this product is all you will need....great product...</li>
    <li> So, I have light skin but dark hairs which grow too quickly to keep up with razor shaving all the time.  Plus the razors really irritate my skin.  I had been going to a spa for Brazilians, and they took all the hair out (for sure), but I did have ingrowns.  It seemed the best option though, at least for the lady parts area.  Then a friend suggested I save money and time, like she does, and do it myself.  So I got this kit to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing it was going to hurt, I decided first to try on my legs.  The warmer got the wax nice and hot and there were enough sticks, but only enough strips to do one leg.  More importantly, IT. TOOK. HOURS.  I am not kidding.  Just to wax my legs.  Also I am a tidy, methodical person and the wax still got all over no matter what I did.  I gave it three different times, and neither the mess nor the time-wasting got any better.  I literally watched 2 full episodes of OITNB in the time it took me to wax my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted my life back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went back to Ye Ole Epilator that I used to just use for smaller areas - not only does it pull out most of the hair (all, if I keep up on the exfoliating...), but it took about 20 minutes to do both legs.  Bam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I find it helpful to hear not just what people thought of the product they are reviewing, but also what they did as alternatives when they are unsatisfied.  So here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking now.  It looks like our options are (1) wax at a spa, (2) wax at home, (3) razor shave, (4) electric shave, (5) move to the woods.  Problems with each are (1) time-consuming, inconvenient, and expensive, (2) time-consuming and messy, (3) time-consuming and irritates my skin, (4) not sure? jury&#x27;s still out, and (5) just no.  So now with the epilator-exfoliating cycle I have a solution for my legs.  But what about the bikini area?  I can do the &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; (outside panty lines) with an epilator - it hurts but not too bad, esp if the hair is shorter and you put powder on the area.  But I can&#x27;t do a Brazilian this way.  Nope.  No, I think I&#x27;m going to just get an electric shaver for rest of this area, see how that works.  (Anyone doing this already?  How&#x27;s it working?)  Now, what about armpits?  I have to tackle that next.  I hear epilating there isn&#x27;t that bad....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you really want to do home wax, have tons of time to spare, and don&#x27;t mind finding black smudges of messy wax all over your body for days afterwards, this is a nice little kit.  It&#x27;s not for me, and there are other, better options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search for the perfect hair-removal system continues....</li>
    <li> Awful. First the cover was cracked even though it was packed with bubble wrap. It took a long time heat up and it was a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;My skin had a terrible reaction to the wax. I did not see numerous other reviews with that same comment so that could just be me. Then it took days for the wax to come off - even after applying wax removal cream. I will send back.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This starter kit is really a good kit for starter. It is easy to follow the directions.</li>
    <li> It came with everything in the picture with nothing damaged.</li>
    <li> good price, good product. this is my second one. I lost my first in a move. Had that one for a few years. The soft wax is nice too.</li>
    <li> Originally found this at Sally&#x27;s, but for $70+ !  I immediately returned it once I discovered it on here for nearly half that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging and most everything was in order.  A couple of the bottles had leaked product, but it was an easy clean up.  I suggest the shipper use stoppers to prevent it from happening again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This started kit contains full sized bottles of just what you need, and no more.  The bigger kit I originally purchased contained bottles of product I didn&#x27;t need and did not have ones that I did need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is just like what you would get in a salon and I love using it and knowing how much money I am saving.  It does take some practice in applying but you get the hang of it if you stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest getting the Brazilian Hard Body Wax when you order, as it does not require the use of muslin strips.</li>
    <li> I love this starter kit, my only complaint is that the lid to the wax warmer had a crack in it but other than that everything works great.</li>
    <li> I received my GiGi starter kit in a timely fashion however the cover that come with the warmer was cracked and damaged. I took the liberty of applying some type of adhesive glue to hold it together, but that&#x27;s not a problem.I can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> The item was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Love it! I just need to learn how to use it</li>
    <li> It takes a bit to heat up so be patient and plan accordingly. If you have never used a waxing kit, be careful not to get wax all over the floor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing at home for over 10 years.  Love to wax over shaving.  I have always used microwave wax, but can no longer find my brand anymore.  So I did as much research as possible, read the reviews and decided to try this system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warming system worked fine, but this wax was VERY PAINFUL to use compared to the previous microwave wax that I used.  Also, the wax is IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE.  I tried the wax remover that came with the system, this did not remove/dissolve all of the wax.  I finally used petroleum jelly which did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to return to a wax that dissolves/cleans up easily with warm water.  If the wax I find can&#x27;t be used with this warmer  -- then I guess I&#x27;ll give it to my daughter to make candles with.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you are a professional if not and your not a student it will just be on your counter. It has everything I just can&#x27;t use it properly.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and everything was perfect with the product. Cant wait to use it 😙</li>
    <li> Took about 25 min to heat up till the liquid form. I dont have very dense or thick hair. the hair got off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;The wax is very sticky. So make sure you strip off carefully and don&#x27;t let the wax be on your gloves or fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Worth it!!</li>
    <li> love it!!! just what i wanted. warmer was smaller than i expected which was a plus because it doesn&#x27;t take up much space. Came with everything a beginner waxer would need in one bundle. SO if your looking for a more affordable wax warmer for a beginner this is the way to go. this can also be a great gift to give. i would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Saving a ton of money doing the waxing at home! Excellent product</li>
    <li> I have been getting salon waxes for years and finally decided to invest in a kit.  This one is PERFECT!  It took about 30 minutes to heat, I followed the directions and in 5 minutes (or less) I had finished and had the same results as if I had gone to the salon.  It was very easy to use, the kit has everything you need, and there was no mess.  I had previously used a kit with a cream wax but after using this would recommend the hard wax.  I found results to be much better.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t wax quite as good as I thought it would. You have to go over the spot a few times but other than that it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Everything is good, but wax was a little out the can.</li>
    <li> Great for people that just want to start their own waxing, I waxed everywhere with this kit.</li>
    <li> The kit was perfect for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Nice setup for the price.  Still haven&#x27;t mastered the art of waxing yet.</li>
    <li> Always went and had my eyebrows done ..bought this and have done mine several times and each time I learn something new ...1.dont get in a hurry 2.have everything ready lol lessons learned ...as far as product its GREAT</li>
    <li> great product for price</li>
    <li> Everything came as described and the wax works great, so convenient and the extra supplies are so helpful for before and after waxing!</li>
    <li> Perfect. All the stuff came with it as shown. Heat quickly. It do it job</li>
    <li> Easy to follow instructions and is true to product description, used it twice and happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Has everything you need and more.</li>
    <li> Great wax and very perfessional set up</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use ! Beats the cost of the salon</li>
    <li> My starter kit is still working and and melts the wax quite quickly so there isn&#x27;t much waiting to start any of my waxing services.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this...great kit for the price! Does take about 30 min to warm the wax. But that&#x27;s ok for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s messy, but it does the job I guess. I&#x27;m going to get a can of the gigi hard wax to see if it&#x27;s less messier. The brand is great, it&#x27;s just the softwax is too messy for me. Also, the strips are so paper thin and the wax seeps through.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so very pleased with this product. Description is down to the T. It works wonders. I&#x27;m considering ordering another one just incase I damage this one, so I have a backup. Thank you</li>
    <li> In time and works great</li>
    <li> I just got this for me at home. I have never used wax before in my life. I managed to make a bit of a mess, but it worked well and I really love it. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get a better hang of it in time. Until then.... I will probably have to order more wax remover... haha</li>
    <li> Perfect for the home!</li>
    <li> The wax takes forever to melt. I waited nearly two hours and it was barely warm enough to use.</li>
    <li> This waxing kit is great! It saves me lots of money and it is honestly a great deal.  I used to buy the wax for 10$ and the wax strips for 10$ too. So this deal is pretty good. The wax machine size is small compared to the one I had before (SAME BRAND) but it does exactly the same work. It brings 3 creams and 1 powder. One cream is pre wax (it&#x27;s like alcohol to clean the area you want to wax), the powder (smells good and using it actually makes it easier to wax), another cream is the wax off and it works amazing (I usually used baby oil but it doesn&#x27;t work as good as this cream and it smells like pineapple. I love it!) and last is the cream that supposedly reduces hair growth (I can&#x27;t say anything about this one because I haven&#x27;t used it much since I don&#x27;t really think it would help but I will give it a shot and update this). It also  brings a honey wax, the strips, and sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: the only bad thing about this pack is that it doesn&#x27;t bring a lot of the wax strips but you can buy 100 strips for like 10$ which is a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> my package came on time with everything it said about the product. i was so excited to use it when it arrived but when use it just got really messy. maybe its because i don&#x27;t know how to use it well but in any case it was a fail for me. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Delivery &amp; package arrived in good condition... Product is excellent. And I can swap out &amp; used different types of waxes from this line.</li>
    <li> This is a must have. Save tons of money and do it yourself! It&#x27;s Super easy to wax yourself!</li>
    <li> Love it! Comes with small, medium and large sticks. Strips, soft wax, pre wax, powder, wax remover, and a slow grow gel. Pre epilation powder is simply talc which technically you&#x27;re not supposed to use because it can clog the open pores that you have just waxed. However the wax remover is great plus it smells nice and tropical like coconuts. Wax has mild smell but doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> When I can do it at home!! Love this kit!</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy to use for a beginner, comes with everything you need, awesome for the price, seen the exact same one at the beauty supply store for twice the price. I like the all purpose honey wax for everything for the most part I also purchased the Brazilian hard wax I love them both for different purposes</li>
    <li> Very efficient kit.  Easy to use and every thing you need to get started!  Very pleased with my purchase and I love the wax.</li>
    <li> I love it. Iworks well. I can control temperature.</li>
    <li> My grandchildren even use this, sure saves paying the price at a salon every month.  First time using it and already paid for itself.  Love it.  Generous amount of supplies come with it.</li>
    <li> Love this so much !!!!  I was so excited to start waxing after using Sally Henson pre wax strips I wanted better results. I got this and I use it for about everything it&#x27;s perfect and  it&#x27;s a little messy if it&#x27;s your first time, but you get the hang of it . Saving a ton of money and doing it myself !</li>
    <li> MY GIRL KNOWS HOW TO USE IT. IT WORKS AND SAVES US MONEY. I  RECOMMEND. GOOD THIS  ITEM</li>
    <li> The kit literally comes with everything you need, but I should have listened to previous reviews because the lid was cracked.</li>
    <li> Great price, arrived quickly, easy to use - as described!</li>
    <li> The starter kit was exactly what I wanted.  The warmer is a bit larger than their old models.  The kit contains all the essentials but I would recommend different strips because muslin strips are not as good.</li>
    <li> Great wax. Professional set. Quick and easy to use</li>
    <li> Works perfectly fine. The lid to cover the warmer was broken when it arrived but nothing super glue couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for years. I touch up at home frequently. I love the gigi pot but needed a replacement for one I broke (my fault). This is a nice kit but i hate the honee wax. It hurts and it doesn&#x27;t pull off cleanly. This coming from a girl who barely flinches at professional Brazilians. The other varieties of their waxes are great. They get the job done and it doesn&#x27;t hurt (I mean...its a pain free as waxing can be). The value of the kit is not bad though since it comes with sticks and pre/post potions.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great deal!</li>
    <li> Really love my Gigi! If you know how to wax your own eyebrows properly, saves you a lot of green.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Love the kit! Just make sure to buy the bibs for the wax because if not it gets all over the warmer</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Gig kit over the years and I still love it.  It saves me so much money and time.  Instead of going to the salon and paying high prices, I take it out, warm it up while I read/cook/clean/visit and then bam... I&#x27;m done in 10 min.  No fuss.  I like nice eyebrows but don&#x27;t need pampered... I&#x27;d rather spend the saved money on travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, if you&#x27;re nervous about getting your eyebrow waxing even, consider getting your eyebrows tattooed first so you can follow the lines. haha</li>
    <li> The temperature broke !</li>
    <li> This is awesome !! And definitely will save you a lot of money on waxing.</li>
    <li> great value for the money. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> My wife says it works well however its really messy.</li>
    <li> The kit arrived well packaged and included everything my wife needed to remove unwanted hair as advertised. LRB</li>
    <li> The wax that comes with this is a mess. I don&#x27;t like it. Unless your an expert waxer, don&#x27;t buy this being a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;It creates a mess that&#x27;s hard to clean off of you. Even with the wax remover.</li>
