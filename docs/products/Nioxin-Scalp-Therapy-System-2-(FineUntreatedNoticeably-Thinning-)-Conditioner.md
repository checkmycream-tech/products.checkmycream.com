<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was more than I expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> Im happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it makes my hair look and feel thicker and fuller! The. Cooling minty tingle also geeks so great on your scalp. I recommend to anyone who can&#x27;t afford the &amp;#34;expensive stuff&amp;#34; to give this a try, it&#x27;s pricey but well worth it, abd better priced here vs. the stores.</li>
    <li> Great price for the volume. I pay more for more than half the volume in salons. Not a knockoff - genuine Nioxin brand product.</li>
    <li> After my fourth order have been disappointed. Think it is over priced in town - your price is not too bad.</li>
    <li> Give this product some time to work on your hair. After a month or so of using this conditioner along with the shampoo, I noticed my hair get thicker. I also started growing hair where I had once lost it all. Depending on your hair length, a small amount of conditioner is all you need. Leave it for a few minutes and rinse it out. I suggest washing your hair every other day, which is what I do along with not using gels that clog up your follicles.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so full and shinny.</li>
    <li> My doctor prescribed Nioxin and it has worked great for me.  Besides helping hair regrowth, another good feature is that there is no perfume/fragrance to aggravate my allergies.  I am totally sold on this product!</li>
    <li> been using this product for 5 years now -- really helps</li>
    <li> The scalp therapy conditioner is great for keeping your hair from drying out and soft as well. At first I was not so keen on the smell since I am used to herbal essence type of fragrances.    It smelled a little mediciny to me at first, but after a few days I realized it was minty. I definitely will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who a receeding hair line and thinning on the top/front of his head.  I have mixed feelings on this product.  I actually cut my husband&#x27;s hair myself and I noticed that within the first three months his hair did feel much thicker on the back part of his head.  It was and still is very full.  I am just disappointed that the hair on the top of his head hasn&#x27;t shown the same results.  In fact he&#x27;s been using this conditioner with the shampoo for 7 months now and the hair on the top of his head has thinned even more.  I don&#x27;t think this is a result of the shampoo/conditioner though.  I am sure it is attributed to hereditary genes and stress. I had just hoped it would at least stop the thinning.  The nice thing is that this 33.8 ounce size lasts a long time.  He is still using the bottle that I bought 7 months ago.  Would I purchase it again...?  Yes.  It is working on the back of his hair and it&#x27;s better than anyting you&#x27;ll find at the grocery store.  Just don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
    <li> We have been using the Nioxin brand for a while now and we love it! I love the way that it makes my hair feel and also how it conditions my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money on hair products over the years. I have always had fine hair but when it began to thin also I panicked. Since I have found nioxin hair products my hair is fuller and healthier than it ever has been. My husband decided he would start using it. It has slowed his hair loss and keeps his fine blond hair looking fuller. also</li>
    <li> Seems to make my hair shiny.  Can&#x27;t speak to its ability to stop hair loss because I didn&#x27;t really track it although I feel better after using it since at least I&#x27;m trying to stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product. I believe it has helped. My hair doesn&#x27;t appear to be as thin as it did before I started using this product.I plan to continue using it and highly recommend it to anyone with thinning hair. Also, even me hairdresser commented that she thought my hair appeared thicker!</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this stuff.  He has used the Nioxin System 2 exclusively for the past few years to try to prevent thinning and really believes it works!  He does not spend a lot of money on products and this is one of the few he really feels is worth splurging on.  I&#x27;ve tried to get him to use my products when he runs out and he hates it.  So we buy the System 2 in bulk now.</li>
    <li> I know this product is kind of pricey for shampoo but it&#x27;s worth it!  Without it my hair just falls out.    Normally I get it from my local Ulta store but the price here beats it hands down (even with a coupon!)</li>
    <li> I like this product so I sent it to a friend whose hair thinned drastically after cancer treatment. She Loves it !</li>
    <li> This has actually helped me stop thinning. I love this. I also don&#x27;t flake when I use it.</li>
    <li> this is just a waste of money, don&#x27;t ever consider buying it, it does not work i will not accept even for free.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for 20 years.  Discovered when a family member was taking chemo drugs.  It is fabulous but use it with the cleanser.  Helps you to hold on to your hair.  Will not grow hair but will help to save what you have.</li>
    <li> Have used Nioxin for years because of thinning hair, which it has slowed dramatically (I believe it would have stopped the loss completely if I&#x27;d used the other parts of the system, i.e., \\&quot;Scalp Treatment\\&quot; and \\&quot;Follicle Booster\\&quot; .. I&#x27;ve used only the shampoo, called \\&quot;Cleanser,\\&quot; and the conditioner, called \\&quot;Scalp Therapy\\&quot;).      Scalp Therapy nourishes the hair follicle.  It is pleasantly cooling on the scalp.  After rinsing, it also leaves my hair feeling and looking its best.  Nioxin is expensive, but very worth it if you can make room for it in your budget.</li>
    <li> Used it for years and recommend it.</li>
    <li> About three years ago, I was working a job that consisted of putting in 14-15 hours a day. I was only 20 at the time, trying to manage working a job while still going to school. Mind you, I was going through a lot of personal stress too, and my hair (that used to be full, thick and healthy) started falling out by the handful in clumps while I would shower. I was told \\&quot;Eat more vegetables and get more vitamins!\\&quot; so of course I did. Unfortunately THAT didn&#x27;t happen.    So while I was at my hairdresser, I was told that nioxin would honestly do the trick. It would be a bit tingly at first on your scalp, but that&#x27;s just the product working it&#x27;s magic. I noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out in large clumps anymore, and the thinning wasn&#x27;t noticeable after a few weeks.    I also noticed that my hair became more fuller and healtier. My mom -- who is the biggest constructive criticizer up to date -- even complimented me on my hair and said the product was working, which I knew it was because she&#x27;ll always tell me how it is!     Also, it&#x27;s a product that you should cycle on and off from. I usually cycle off and on during seasons. So I&#x27;ll be using the product for the winter season, then cycle off for Spring. And so on and so forth.    Anyway, I&#x27;m planning on buying a new batch of this after my next paycheck. My hair is beginning to thin and fall out again (mind you it&#x27;s been 2+ years since I&#x27;ve used the product) and I know that it&#x27;ll be the hair therapy I need.    The only con&#x27;s are that it is a very expensive product, but your hair and it&#x27;s health is also an investment, so why not invest in something that will honestly give you the results you need, instead of continuously buying cheaper products that don&#x27;t do the trick?</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for just one month. I can already see a decrease in hair loss and some small indications that re-growth may be starting.&lt;br /&gt;Hooray!!</li>
    <li> It works. Just too bad it has &amp;#34;charcoal tar&amp;#34; as an ingredient. Really not pleased about that, it seems unintelligent to rub that into the scalp.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Not to heavy, good for thin hair</li>
    <li> wonderful product and great value</li>
    <li> What an amazing product and an incredible value.  We got this for one-third of the cost we were spending at the salon!  How can it get any better???</li>
    <li> I meant to order the shampoo but use this anyway so I kept it.</li>
    <li> THE NEW FORMULA IS HORRIBLE AND DAMAGES AND DRIES OUT THE HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR IS LIKE STRAW, AFTER  HAPPILY USING THIS PRODUCT FOR&lt;br /&gt;20 YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD MOVE FOR P AND GAMBLE...NO WAY!  CANNOT USE THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN</li>
    <li> This product is the best one I&#x27;ve found so far to use as a detangler/conditioner.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helping me keep my hair, however, as I still notice hair in my comb after I shampoo, but maybe not quite as much as before.  I plan to keep using it, however, to see what happens as more time passes.  I like the minty fragrance of the Nioxin products, but the large bottles are really hard to handle in the shower. I wish this item came in a pump bottle which I could just set on the corner shower seat -- would be so much easier.  I don&#x27;t have arthritis or anything like that; in fact, I&#x27;m very fit, but picking up any kind of bottle and trying to squeeze out the contents is pretty hard to do with slippery, soaped up hands -- or should I say \\&quot;hand\\&quot; -- I need the other hand to catch the product as it squeezes out.  A comment on price -- it can&#x27;t be beat.  I tried buying Nioxin products at two major box stores here in town -- I&#x27;d call their prices highway robbery.  So I will continue to buy my Nioxin from Amazon -- I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it&#x27;s availability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to believe the hype of marketing and advertising but I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for years and find that my hair has significantly stopped thinning and my hairline seems to have stopped in its tracks.  I&#x27;ve also noticed, strangely, that I have less gray! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a result of using the shampoo and conditioner but either way, I&#x27;m glad.  My room mate used it while he was staying with me between jobs and thought that it thickened his hair.  If you have thinning hair, I recommend giving it a try.  For me, it works!</li>
    <li> The Nioxin Scalp Therapy Conditioner works extremely well with my fine hair!  After using it for a few weeks my hair has noticeable gotten thicker and is stronger. It feels good and looks fantastic!  I have finally stopped my search for a good conditioner and will stick with this.  Glad to have finally stumbled upon this!</li>
    <li> The vendor I bought this from diluted the product with water by about 50%.  This order was sold by Amazon - so I do not know the supplier.  I have used this product for years and I know that it has a very thick almost pasty consistancy.  What I got was watery.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good price, thanks</li>
    <li> This product is making a positive improvement in my hair, I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for!!!  Last year I was fortunate enough to be selected for a trial study for Nioxin, and received a 6 month supply of shampoo, conditioner, and scalp treatment.  I was absolutely thrilled at how fabulous my hair felt after using it for just one month.  I do not think I actually grew any more hair, but the condition and quality of my hair improved immensely, and I do think there was less hair lost in my brushes.  The rich thick lather, the minty scent, and the tingly sensation on my scalp were all things I loved about it.  However, when I saw how much it would cost me to continue using Nioxin, I started looking online for better prices, with this Amazon deal being far and away the best. (It&#x27;s $50 or more for this size bottle everywhere else vs. $31 on Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, when I started using the bottles I purchased from Amazon, it was clear from the first use that this was not the same product.  It was either watered down, or something entirely different.  The conditioner did not have the same almost \\&quot;buttery\\&quot; feeling, and NO tingle at all.  The shampoo did not have the same rich lather, and the fragrance, while similar, is nowhere near as strong.  My hair has gone from soft, silky, and strong, back to dry and crunchy since I&#x27;ve been using these two bottles. It could now possibly be in worse condition than it was before I participated in the study.  I&#x27;m not sure if this product came from a 3rd party selling through Amazon, or Amazon itself, but I am extremely disappointed either way. I thought Amazon was a retailer I could trust...I will probably limit my future purchases to books.  At least I  know what I&#x27;m getting then.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was Amazon or a change by Nioxin, but this is not the same product. I&#x27;ve used Nioxin System 2 for years and my hair has always been full and healthy while using it. However, the last bottle I received from Amazon put my hair right back to how it was before I started Nioxin - thin and frail. I will not be buying this product through Amazon any longer and I strongly suggest anyone considering this product to look elsewhere. Hopefully this was not a change by Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It was a generic product sent to me. Nioxin is great, I just recommend getting it from a reputable source so you know you&#x27;re getting the real thing. I highly recommend System 2.</li>
    <li> Use this along with the cleanser and supplements and my hair is so much thicker then it was. These products are well worth the money. I shopped for the best price and found it here. If you&#x27;re hair is thinning and you want something that works this does!!!</li>
    <li> Pricey shampoo and I like the way it leaves what little hair I have but I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years and I&#x27;m still loosing hair.  Perhaps I would have lost more hair and faster if I hadn&#x27;t been using Nioxin - I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico.  It appears to me they may have also changed the formula.  Either way, I don&#x27;t perceive the same thickening effect it used to have.  This is unfortunate because I used to really love this product line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for over five years and it works great.  I have very fine, thinning hair... Nioxin is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that strengthens my hair and contributes to new grow.</li>
    <li> I love the way my scalp tingles with this stuff.  It rinses out easily too.  You simply haven&#x27;t lived until this goop has hit your scalp.  Try it today!</li>
    <li> Nioxin is high a quality product that anyone with thinning hair or fine hair should try. I believe it will be of benefit to them.</li>
    <li> Product was okay...shipping failed...one bottle opened  during shipping...</li>
    <li> If your hair is thinning, try this. I&#x27;ve used this plus the shampoo for about a year and my hair is think again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for thinning hair.  Very concentrated.  So, it doesn&#x27;t require a large amount.  I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> I need  Urgent  one More</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Makes my head all tingly, an fresh feeling.  Youll love it too</li>
    <li> I love this product so much.! This is my second time buying it off Amazon. At first i wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect , I read other peoples review and finally decide to give it a try. I have bought the 33.8 ounce which lasted me about 2 months I believe using it 5 times a week. This product is great it leaves your hair shiny and really soft. I always had problems with freeze hair ..but after using this product i noticed a huge difference in the way my hair looked. I love it and would recommend it to anyone. It is a little bit pricy but i know you will deff not regret getting this product. I have been using different hair conditioners all my life but I&#x27;ve finally settle and settle for the best! :) its not greay, it doesn&#x27;t stink, has a cooling effect on your head, .. it just perfect.! :)     PS: I also have some thinning hair .. and this product has helped me add some volume to the thinning areas.</li>
    <li> My son and his wife use this product and said they have good results from it, so my wife is trying it now and don,t know how she will like it.</li>
    <li> Bottle was broken open when I received it!</li>
    <li> I love this brand. It makes my hair look fuller and gives it back the body my hair lost when I let it go white.</li>
    <li> I began using Nioxin 2010 due to a thinning hair problem.  My hair began to fall out and did not know what I was going to do.  A beautician told me about Nioxin and informed me that this product would improve hair growth.  I became a believer when I noticed slight improvement in my hair growth.  However, I have been using Nioxin for over a year and I still have thinning and some baldness in areas that are really noticiable.  I can say the product does work, but if your hair is thinning from Alepecia you might get the total results you are looking for.  I would recommend trying it and make your own judgement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two years and I still like it.  My hair looks and feels good; it&#x27;s thick and has a good shine.  I can&#x27;t claim that it stopped my hair from falling out, however.  It was still doing that even after 6 months on this product.  What really helped is when I started taking 5000mcg of both B-12 and Biotin every day.  After about 8 weeks, no more hair loss or breakage!  I&#x27;m a male Caucasian, age 63.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recent order from this vendor was a great price and was delivered very quickly without any problems.</li>
    <li> Love the peppermint in it&#x27;</li>
    <li> When one can please one&#x27;s husband, it is good.  He needed -I bought!  It is a winning situation for me!</li>
    <li> The bottle is completely white, the wordings you see in the pic is actually a stick-on label. For Nioxin products I bought from the stores, the wordings are all printed on the bottle not sticked on. This makes me wonder if the product is authentic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and really do think it&#x27;s helped keep my scalp healthy and retarded my hair loss.  I&#x27;d absolutely recommend it.  The 33oz bottle lasts me 2-3 months for the scalp therapy and 4-5 months for the cleanser.  It does cost more than traditional shampoo/conditioner but the larger bottle sizes/longer duration of use help offset that cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Shampoo and Scalp therapy (conditioner) for fine hair for 5 years.  It did make my hair feel fuller and stopped hair from appearing in my brush and on my pillowcase.  I recently ordered a new supply from Amazon and found the smell and texture of both products to be different.  Checking on the internet, Procter and Gamble recently bought out Nioxin and changed the formula!  I checked my old bottle with the new and the ingredients are very different.  The conditioner is very gloppy and greasy feeling and difficult to rinse out.  The shampoo is more runny and doesn&#x27;t have the minty smell.  My hair doesn&#x27;t have the body it had with the old formula.  My hairdresser suggested I switch to Bosley.</li>
    <li> My hair still feels dry and brittle after using this product for two months. Waiting for some positive effects.</li>
    <li> Feels very minty on you head</li>
    <li> I ordered Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 6 (Noticeably Thinning ) Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce .&lt;br /&gt;But received Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 2 (Noticeably Thinning ) Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have asked for a replacement, hoping to get it right this time.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nioxin 2 scalp treatment for years.  I think it has helped.</li>
    <li> I have used this  product for some time.  I noticed I was having major hair loss in my brush.  Since using it everyday Hair loss&lt;br /&gt;is close to Zero.  My hair looks full.  If I have gained back hair it has been slow.  At least I will not be bald like my Dad and&lt;br /&gt;Brother</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t provide any improvement to current situation.  would not recommend to others.  did not cause any harm but did not provide any benefit either.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product. Hopefully it saves my hair :)</li>
    <li> I had previously been using the Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 1 (all 3 products) and needed to replace my conditioner.  I wanted to try &#x27;2&#x27; this time to see if it would improve the look of thickness of my hair.  I used it one time and a co-worker told me my hair looked thicker that day!</li>
    <li> Beautonic is the best dealer for nioxon ......</li>
    <li> Fresh, clean fragrance.  Even though there&#x27;s no cure for the hair loss I&#x27;m experiencing, I know I&#x27;m treating what&#x27;s left with the utmost care by using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product really works.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and intact.  I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for 120 years and it is still great.</li>
    <li> I really like the way that this product makes my hair feel.  It seems to be thicker too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with both the cleanser and conditioner, leaves my hair feeling good and has definitely slowed down the amount I lose.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I notice a difference immediately when I use this... Great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thinning hair, this is a must!</li>
    <li> I have been I have been using it for years, it seems to be working and the price  better  then in stores.</li>
    <li> This product works great been using it for a year with great results .thank you I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I am 49 and have been using this Nioxin products for as long as the company has been around. I have a full head of hair. My brother sneered at my use of this product 20 years ago but he has since gone completely bald.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re wondering if this product works, it does.  I was skeptical at first but desperate, so I took the plunge and bought it.  No kidding, I&#x27;ve been receiving numerous complements, mostly, \\&quot;I like what you&#x27;re doing with your hair,\\&quot; and this was from a male co-worker.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does.  I think someone commented that it smelled like urine, but I&#x27;m happy to tell you that it does not.</li>
    <li> Product seems to have harsh chemicals for a sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> Very good deal for the price. Large bottle almost for the same price as a small bottle on the market. It does seem to help with thinning hair but I think it stops at a certain point. It&#x27;s not likely to keep strengthening your hair beyond a certain limit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. His hair was starting to thin out real bad, so he has been using this for a while.  I am starting to see the difference.  It appears to be thicker, and it definately feels thicker.  It may take about 3 months before you see a difference, so don&#x27;t give up too soon.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this, I can see major diff in the amount of hair I was loosing and how much fuller my hair has gotten. Been using this product for 2 yrs now</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 20 years and have always been pleased with results.  It is more expensive than other products but well worth the additional expense.  Makes your hair thicker and fuller without with a nice sheen.  Hair feels clean and soft and adds good body.</li>
    <li> I always have had thin hair, but since i started using this products, I have more hair for sure. I have recommended this shampoo and conditioner therapy to lots of friends that have very this hair or small amount of hair</li>
    <li> I am very skeptical about trying these products knowing most of them do NOT work. Well.... I got the shampoo &amp; conditioner and I could tell the difference in a week. My hair is paper fine and this gave it thickness. Im very pleased with it and will continue to use it. So ladies if you are thinning up top! This is your product!</li>
    <li> If you go to a local retailer, you will pay twice the price.  My husband has seen a noticeable improvement in his hair and hair loss.  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this to folks with excessively thinning hair.  Works well for me without being greasy or shinny or glossy.</li>
    <li> Find me one guy who wouldn&#x27;t like a healthy head of hair.  I always used cheap shampoos and a basic showerhead.  Then when I got into my fifties, my already thin hair started to thin more and more quickly.  I could see recession on top and in the front.  Yikes.  The lady who cuts my hair is a cute little Philippian woman who noticed this and HAD to bring it to everyone&#x27;s attention.  She also managed to tell everyone in the shop that my neck was all broken out.  This she said was from bad conditioner (Pantene).  Thanks for telling the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the same time, Dr. Oz was on Oprah telling everyone to get shower filters in their showerheads to eliminate the toxins, including chlorine.  This made sense.  So I dutifully went to Home Depot and bought a showerhead with a filter that changes every six months and the Nioxin Therapy, which my hair-cutter recommended.  I read the ingredients and its Greek to me, but the hair therapy is amazing.  Leave it on for three minutes and your scalp feels tingly.  Rinse it out and the tingly sensation stays for another five minutes or so.  After one year, I noticed my hair did not seem to be thinning anymore and it was soft and I could comb it anyway I wanted.  It&#x27;s just healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why not five stars?  Well, Nioxin is expensive, so although I highly recommend it, I also recommend that you buy the 1,000ml bottles.  They are a better deal.  I&#x27;ve also tried the Nioxin Shampoo and the Nioxin Scalp Treatment.  These are nice, but also expensive.  I&#x27;ll settle just for a gentle cheap shampoo and the Nioxin Therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, guys want this information too.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin products for many years. I have thinning hair and it has helped slow the process. I wouldn&#x27;t say it grows hair like other products, like Rograine, claim but since I&#x27;ve never used these products I can&#x27;t say they don&#x27;t work. I highly recommend Nioxin for thinning hair, and for those of you that want to slow down the process.</li>
    <li> Nioxin conditioner leaves your hair feeling smooth and bouncy. The scent is light and clean also.  Tjmaxx sells the product at a greatly reduced price.</li>
    <li> After buying this stuff for a couple years through a friend at warehouse price, I moved out of state.  This is the best price I can find and my only concern was whether or not it&#x27;s the real thing.  It is the real thing and not one bit different than what I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years.  Buy it with confidence.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe I have not bought it before. Really made a difference for my hair. I used to have lots of dandruff. No more thanks to this and shampoo.</li>
    <li> The product is slightly cheaper than some of the 2 packs I&#x27;ve been seeing on amazon. I think it works as promised, however you should try it for yourself to see. I think it does a great job myself, and although many other people claim the formula has changed, I think it still works for me.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling soft, thicker and it really cleans the scalp.  It&#x27;s the only conditioner that I use now when I am able to afford it.</li>
    <li> Oooooops! I thought I was ordering the shampoo and booboo&#x27;ed and purchased the conditioner. This was received fast and packed well. I sent it back so I could order the shampoo. Great product.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as advertised &amp; shipped promptly.  I will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product &amp; I have used for quite awhile. Seems to  have thickened my hair a bit as I was told by my barber it would.</li>
    <li> Best thing out there w/ the CAVEAT OF YOU MUST NOT STOP USING IT OR HAIR WILL FALL OUT. But it&#x27;s affordable so I keep using it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two years now and would not use anything else.  This product is well made and not clumpy or oily as others have experienced.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  Was very happy I was able to purchase it through Amazon.  It actually arrived earlier than was predicted!  Would recommend this product for fine hair, it gives body yet doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down!</li>
    <li> Have been using for 2 months, everyday and n noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Great product at a super great price!! Will use this seller again!! Thanks td</li>
    <li> Bought this for my niece.  She had chemo a year ago and now is trying to get her hair to grow back.  So far it looks to be working very well.</li>
    <li> I am not a scientist and have no idea if this actually works.  My fiancée swears my hair is filling in, has more body and looks great...I suspect she is telling me this because she is my fiancée, however, she may be telling the actual truth too..  What I can say is it appears my hair loss is slowing, possibly stopping since beginning use.  I do not think this is a wonder cure but it may work to slow the process.  I&#x27;ll keep using.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff as my shaving gel for my face. It is awesome, produces a nice tingle and hydrates your face. Never have an issue with razor burn</li>
    <li> always like nioxin they works for money</li>
    <li> My hair keeps thinning and falling out. This product might have slowed it down a little but not enough to make a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair fuller and easy to style.</li>
    <li> I love the product and the amazon cost is one third the price at a salon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive everywhere you can find it, and it never really worked for me. I switched to more natural solutions and have had much more success.</li>
    <li> I ordered the shampoo and got stuck with this. Threw away the package because I didn&#x27;t notice the problem until later.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, I overall like it, I notice my hair being a bit thicker but unfortunately this is not a miracle cure, it just seems to slow down the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells Great!&lt;br /&gt;Feels Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: a bit pricey</li>
    <li> Does nothing as far as thickness. I have been using for 3 mos.</li>
    <li> Love Nioxin. Def a life saver for hair loss. Great price for size. It&#x27;s much more expensive in stores for smaller bottles. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Delivered as stated.  Positive purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a real one, not fake. I&#x27;m very happy! Before I made my payment I was worried. But now I made a nice try!</li>
    <li> This manufacturer always produces great products.  I have seborrhea on my scalp and most conditioners exacerbate the problem.  None of the Nioxin products cause a problem and most, like the scalp therapy conditioner improve my scalp.</li>
    <li> Hey, my noggin is still making its way to Chrome Domeville but now it&#x27;s a little slower and the hair I do have looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me from losing massive amount of hair with every wash.  I used to be scared of washing my hair.  You won&#x27;t see the effect until about a week or two, but you need to stay consistent.  don&#x27;t use other products and make sure to follow product instructions of usage.</li>
    <li> noticed some improvement. shouldn&#x27;t have purchased such a large quantity because it became watered down after a while. Might use in the future.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years to regrow hair lost due to health problems.  Works great and keeps scalp healthy. Big fan!  Follow-Up:  I have been using this brand for at least 10 years.  The past few bottles I have ordered seem to be different.  Watered down?  Anyone have this opinion?  I don&#x27;t know if the brand changed or I am being scammed by sellers who are diluting the product.</li>
    <li> I think this product does give you fuller looking hair and seems to stop hair from falling out. I use it at least once a day and the bottle lasts me about 3 months. I would definitely recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> stuff had an adverse effect actually made my scalp very dry. I found out my hair issue was a vit d deficieny</li>
    <li> I switched to a new hairstylist last spring, and she recommended the Nioxin 2 system because my hair is starting to thin.  I was skeptical at first, but willing to try it, especially since she wasn&#x27;t selling it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 9 months.  I did feel the new little hairs growing in after about 4-6 weeks.  About 4 months ago, I also started using Minoxidil for women.  Between the two products, I do have a fair amount of new hair growing.  Unfortunately, my hair is very, very fine, and most of the new hair that has grown in is mostly silver (and age-appropriate), so I will never have a very thick mane, but I can tell that the product does work.  Nioxin works by cleaning the scalp of oils and residue that clog hair follicles and prevent hair from growing.  Minoxidil works by neutralizing hormones that cause hair to fall out, and by shortening the \\&quot;rest\\&quot; period of the follicles.  If you use both products, you increase the number of active follicles and keep the hair you do have longer.  I purchased my first couple of bottles of Nioxin at a local Big Box retailer and was shocked by the price there and at several other local stores, and have been very pleased to find it for a more user-friendly price here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I ordered this conditioner. I absolutely love it. The smell is minty and cooling.&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on for several minutes it feels like you are getting a massage. Before I started using this conditioner along with&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo It seemed my hair was falling out like crazy. I don&#x27;t notice as much hair fall out as before.&lt;br /&gt;Although some times my hair gets frizzy. (I think that is more due to the humidity here.) I just use a polishing serum when that&lt;br /&gt;happens.[[ASIN:B000XTCFME Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 2 (Fine/Untreated/Noticeably Thinning ) Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Great deal.  It&#x27;s much cheaper ordering this item through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good conditioner. Not sure if it&#x27;s slowing hair loss, but just as a conditioner it does the job.</li>
    <li> I have hair loss due to a medical condition. Nioxin may not be the cure but I find it to be a very clean and natural product whether it helps with a hair loss condition due to illness or not, I would recommend this product...</li>
    <li> This is a quality product that provides a healthy conditioning of fine, thinning hair.  I have been using it for several years. I bought it at a competitive price.  It is well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and like the result. I was not expecting a miracle but it did slow down my hair loss. There was also a noticeable improvement in my hair.</li>
    <li> it works fine for me, as well as for some friends who I suggested it to.  Hair seems somewhat thicker, but can&#x27;t tell if it promotes additional growth or not.  Still, I will keep using it and recommending it.</li>
    <li> I started using Nioxin about 7 years ago and it seems to help me keep what hair I have left.</li>
    <li> My husband it using this product for 3 years now and he isn&#x27;t willing to change it. He uses the whole set, of shampoo + conditioner + after shower treatment.</li>
    <li> This product was highly rated and approved of by my dermatologist.  I can see real results from use of this product</li>
    <li> Excellent! Great customer services!</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t suddenly grow back a lot of hair but the Nioxin system leaves fine hair with a workeable texture.  It is an expensive product and hard to find a medium sized bottle.  33 oz is like the size for a salon so I am using it to re-fill an older bottle.  Price is an excellent deal compared to stores charging twice as much.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin Systems 2 Cleanser, Scalp Therapy, Scalp Treatment and Follicle Repair as part of a daily regimen for almost 10 years. I believe it does work as advertised in retarding hair loss.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a hair loss problem, but I must be part reptile because I seem to shed my scalp daily. No dandruff shampoo has ever worked. Although this isn&#x27;t advertised to control dandruff and psoriasis, a friend told me it does and I tried it. It is the only thing I ever found that has worked. And a 33.8 oz bottle for $18.50 shipped is a great deal for this.</li>
    <li> Works great if you have the curse of fine, straight hair. Especially if you are losing what little you had ... ;-) ...</li>
    <li> I thought it would inhibit me from losing my hair.  It did not.  It did make it fluffy and clean. It has a nice minty smell and tingle.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for somthing to stop the thinning of your hair go to your doctor and get a proscription for Propecia and do rograine or Lipogaine and do it fast as you can.</li>
    <li> no review required , product is beyond reviews :)  , i am using this from many years now , but this is one of the best shampooo</li>
    <li> I stopped using my prescription medicine when my hairdresser introduced me to Nioxin.  I have been using it for two years with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a good product!</li>
    <li> I am very skeptical about trying these products knowing most of them do NOT work. Well.... I got the shampoo &amp; conditioner and I could tell the difference in a week. My hair is paper fine and this gave it thickness. Im very pleased with it and will continue to use it. So ladies if you are thinning up top! This is your product!</li>
    <li> I see no difference to the thinning of my hair and feel that this product is highly over rated.  I was disappointed in the delivery time of this product as I thought it to be next day deliver (3 days for holiday weekend) and it took 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kay</li>
    <li> Product as described. Very well packaged. Fast delivery. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Have notice my hair thinning our for the last 2 years. I really liked this product. But for some reason it seems that either my scalp is used to it or the formula is diferent. No more tingling sensation as I used to feel in the  beginning.</li>
    <li> I stopped using conditioners because they all flattened my hair and made it feel too thin. A tiny bit of this on the other hand does everything a conditioner should do...makes hair shiny, manageable, healthy and fuller!  The combo of Nioxin Cleanser, System 2, plus Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 2 and  Kenra Platinum Thickening Glaze ended my years of searching for the perfect hair products!!!</li>
    <li> It definitely works well on my hair.  I use the shampoo as well but use the Number 1 scalp treatment.  My hair was thinning due to a thyroid condition but this has really brought it back.</li>
    <li> The price is great, compared to getting it in a local store. My hair loss has nearly stopped since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Okay... so having a thinning hair guy write to justify spending $30 for a liter of hair product is completely suspect all in itself.  OF COURSE I AM GOING TO BE BIASED -- I Just spent $30 on hair products and I am a guy.  That said, here is scoop.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and I definitely feel a difference in my hair fullness when I am using the scalp therapy vs. not.  I haven&#x27;t taken pictures so I can&#x27;t say that it appears fuller, but I have thinning hair and it seems to be holding at the current level and not getting much worse over the last 5 years.  If $90 a year can bring me that comfort that I am doing something ($90 is the cost of the shampoo, therapy conditioner, and the scalp spray stuff) then I think that is a good value.  I know that when I don&#x27;t use it my hair feels thinner when I am washing it, so my vote is this stuff does work, and I credit it with the hair I have left.  As a side benefit I love the tingling and smell of the shampoo and other products.  When I wake up it is a great start to the morning.</li>
    <li> i have been using nioxin bproducts for about 17 years now.  i use shampooo daily but conditioner every other day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it seems to be helping my thinning hair.  Compared to other products that I&#x27;ve used, I think this is pretty consistent, and smells nice as well.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it seems like it does what it claims.</li>
    <li> Initially makes your hair feel smoother.</li>
    <li> Turns out, if you dye your hair and dye your hair and dye your hair and live life by the motto &amp;#34;Whatever. It&#x27;ll grow back&amp;#34;, your hair WON&#x27;T always grow back. Combine all of that stress on my hair with internal anxiety and stress, and it was pretty obvious why I had a thinning spot on top of my head. You could see my scalp in pictures, which I found to be mortifying, especially in the age of Facebook, when your photos are everywhere. I was getting married in a year; something had to be done before then! Enter my delightfully blunt hairstylist who told me that I needed to use this product. She sold me the shampoo and conditioner and told me to use it &amp;#34;religiously.&amp;#34; I did, and well before my wedding, I could see a difference. My hair is thicker (although it will never be as thick and glamorous as it was before I dyed it to death), the balding spot is mostly gone, and my friends have complimented the product for doing such a great job. It smells great too, which is a bonus. (Conditioner smells like anise; shampoo smells like eucalyptus. They smell good combined, which I wouldn&#x27;t have thought.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note of how good this product is - when I told my aunt, a breast cancer survivor, that I was using it, she exclaimed, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s what the doctors told me to use when I was going through chemo! It made my hair grow back even better than before!&amp;#34; So there you have it. Good for people who willingly abuse their hair, and good for people who unfortunately have to abuse their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Full disclosure: Same review as Nioxin Shampoo)</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;They removed the active ingredient from the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Now if you want the results you used to get from it, you have to buy other products.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it is the right shampoo and conditioner for me.&lt;br /&gt;Wilhelmina Snow</li>
    <li> It was well worth the money. I had chemo and this really helped get all the toxins out of my scalp. My hair has come in so much more then I could realize.</li>
    <li> Giant bottle......not change in my hairs.....just lots of advertising.......and spending extra time in shower and increase my water bill. Shampoo is probably enough.</li>
    <li> I have been using the complete Nioxin system for about a year. I just thought about looking online. I like the size of the bigger product I feel like I was getting more for my money. I would like to see a system for advance thinning hair? I will keep ordering online to get more for the money...</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT REAL.  Go buy store bought regular shampoo and save your money.  OR buy from an authorized dealer.  The color is lighter, no tingling, etc.  Anyone posting this is real is a bought review. PERIOD.</li>
    <li> made this conditioner like they used to it might actually work still. This new thinner style of conditioner seems terrible to me. Maybe they use different ingredients or formula but it no longer helps with my hair loss issue</li>
    <li> I read the reviews regarding this product before I purchased it and I was a little concerned about the change in manufacturing.  While the product itself is slightly different (sticker labels, a little different feel of the actual conditioner) the results I desire are still delivered by Nioxin&#x27;s level 2 scalp therapy.  Here is how I support this claim:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear hair gel.  At a certain age I noticed that as I put the gel in my hair and styled it I was having many many hairs stuck on my hand.  This was alarming so I started using Nioxin about 2 years ago.  After about 1 week of use my hands had NO... i repeat NOOOO hair on them after rubing my sticky hands through my hair.  This result has not changed with the new product. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product despite some aesthetic changes and a slight change in formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I have noticed that if I do not use it for a few days I revert back to the hair loss that I was noticing before I started using nioxin,  This was true before and is still true***</li>
    <li> Hubby said it help his scalp.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product, along with the cleansing system for several years now and have noticed a considerable slow down in thinning hair.  My hair is very fine and thin and this helps stop the thinning.</li>
    <li> Great product and company!</li>
    <li> works ok I guess but not overly impressed.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this to me when I started noticing my hair really thinning after I had a hysterectomy and went into early menopause overnight.  So depressing to keep waking up to less hair on my head and more hair on the shower floor!  I use this every day and my hair seems to have stopped falling out-It has not made my hair any thicker (I don&#x27;t think it is meant to) and the smell is something you have to get used to-very medicinal-I recommend it-You do have to use it every day.  I have not had any of the issues people have commented on about it being made in Mexico and being of poor quality.  This is the third time I have ordered the large size and it&#x27;s been fine for me.</li>
    <li> This conditioner worked well on my hair, leaving it feeling softer. I have only used it for a short time so I can&#x27;t say yet if it has helped with the thinning of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin for over 15 years with wonderful results.  Recently I bought new bottles at Ulta and noticed a huge difference in my hair.  I had been getting what must have been the old formula at Marshalls and TJ Maxx as closeouts.  My hair is now dry and falling out again.  I called the company to find out that they have changed the formula and if you read the back you can see that it has a lot more garbage products in it that it didn&#x27;t have before.  I will never buy this product again and will return what I have in the house.  I can&#x27;t believe they changed a product that was so wonderful with so many great results to a cheaper, low quality product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND LIKE IT VERY MUCH.  THERE IS NO ODOR TO SPEAK OF.</li>
    <li> Best value! Less expensive than any hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;This product works.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks. I first purchased this at the salon I get my hair done. I paid the same price for an 8 oz. tube. Amazon had the best price. It does tingle on my scalp and sometimes feels a bit itchy. It is not too bad or I would have stopped using it. I am also taking 5000 mg of biotin and also use the nioxin scalp treatment. I use the nexxus Vitatress biotin shampoo, which I love. I think the combination of everything is helping my hair. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and pre menapausal. My blonde hair was always very fine, but I noticed it thinning alot more this past year. I see a little receding around my hairline and its very scary. This will last you a long time. The price is good and you have nothing to lose by trying it. My hair texture feels slightly thicker and I can see some small hairs growing. I will continue to use this and hope for the best. You have to give this some time to see results. It will not happen instantly so keep with it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t grow hair, but it certainly makes what you have look great. I use it daily and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this entire system (shampoo, conditioner, and scalp therapy).  Even though I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell a difference in my hair growth, my hair appears to be thicker and is much easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Product contains paraben which is cancerous so I return the item. Looking for something paraben-free instead to use in preventing hairloss.</li>
    <li> Best product that I have found to clean my hair. Does not damage my hair. Size of container is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I bought this System #2 because the price was very good compared to buying this same product in a Hair Care product store. I&#x27;ve used it for a about 2 months without any noticeable change.</li>
    <li> Buy it for the husband, he thinks it has helped him retain his hair. I however think he looks good no matter if he has hair or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It was originally recommended to me by my barber.  I&#x27;ve noticed thicker, fuller hair since I began using this.</li>
    <li> I already use this product &amp; like it...</li>
    <li> I have very fine, noticeably thinning hair and have used this product along with the Nioxin cleanser and hair booster for years.  While my hair is still thin, I don&#x27;t lose it like I did.  My beautician says I actually have fine hair growing back at my scalp.  I also love the smell of this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s suit for me.I can see .</li>
    <li> First time I use this product and as soon as it touch my hair it made it extremely soft!!!! Delivery was fast and easy!!! Hoping to start seeing changes soon!!!</li>
    <li> The best conditioner for dry to very dry scalp. Been using this for about 7 years now. Very very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works great! Arrived in perfect condition...pat schekirke</li>
