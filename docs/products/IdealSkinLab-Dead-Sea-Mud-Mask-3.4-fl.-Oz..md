      <li>It does tingle and sting at first which actually feels good to me</li>
      <li>After first use, I felt like a had a mini face lift!</li>
      <li>But I love the way it makes my skin feel like its fresh and new.</li>

    <li> Skin feels amazing after 1 treatment. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> BEST MUD MASK I EVER TRIED! AMAZING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my wife. She became a fan of Dead Sea cosmetics after we went on a trip to Israel a couple of years ago and spent a few days at the Dead Sea. Its minerals and salts really work wonders with your skin and after that my wife started using exclusively Dead Sea cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what she has to say about this mud mask:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used it 3 times already and am very happy with this product! I apply only a thin layer after I wash my face and remove make up. It dries quickly, and washes off easily...does not have weird odor like other masks and the texture is smooth. After first use, I felt like a had a mini face lift! And my skin was so soft to the touch!!! Irritation and redness that I before diminished after first application, and are now completely gone after 3rd use.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels after using this! Amazing results!</li>
    <li> The best,when I wash it off it leaves my skin so hydrated like it has lotion in it,I don&#x27;t even have to put face moisturizer  after,LOVE IT❤️</li>
    <li> Love it!! My skin looks great the day I do the mask and the day after!! Hoping with continued use my skin will look good every day...I have Rosecea :/ one downside was my jar seemed like it wasn&#x27;t filled all the way, just barely over half full. Anybody else have that problem??</li>
    <li> i bought it for my niece she loves it</li>
    <li> Wife loved it.  I&#x27;ll be ordering it in the future.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice, but my skin feels better already. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate it at all. It is also a good sized jar of it.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product. Only issue I had with it, is that it comes in a small enough container (3.4oz) as is, only to open it and find that the mud hasn&#x27;t been packed in tightly enough, so feel a little cheated on of the amount of product inside.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Not only does my skin feel tighter, my completion has cleared up and several people have commented I look younger. I love that it&#x27;s made in Israel!!!</li>
    <li> Skin feels smooth and refreshed after use. I have only used it twice but so far my skin feels smoother. Lots of tingling at first but it subsides. It looks really gross but my skin feels so soft after.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use this.  It definitely has the ability to eliminate impurities and toxins in your pores.  If you use it too often it will over dry your skin.  I use it before bed 2 nights a week.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as advertised. Came quickly and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Got it for the girlfriend. She loves it. Says it makes her skin feel great and refreshed.</li>
    <li> It was okay. I just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> I really love this mask! A little it goes a long way, so I don&#x27;t have to scoop out half the jar just to cover my face. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and feels so nice and silky on my skin.</li>
    <li> I do truly love this product. Clean, smooth complexion at 47.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife an this is what she thought about it. \\&quot; I love love love this product, its better than i thought it would be, after just one use my face was cleared up from stubborn acne and my face is brighter and smoother! this is such an amazing mask if i could give it more stars i would! seriously if you dont buy it..your missing out. :]</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and love this product! I&#x27;m really into facial regiments and use this product about twice a week!</li>
    <li> This mud soothes red itchy skin condition. It stung a little on the first few usages but mine is on the sensitive side.  Several weeks later, the minor stinging sensation went away.  This mud has fragrance and other additives like aloe Vera.  All in all, it does what it claims to do.  A healthier alternative to over counter anti itch creams like cortisone.</li>
    <li> This mask has a VERY strong smell of cologne. In the description it says its free of chemicals and additives but on the ingredients list on the jar it says it contains Fragrance(parfum). The smell is actually so strong it made me sick after I applied it and my face was extremely irritated. I would not recommend anybody to use this.</li>
    <li> I like this mask, it makes my skin smoother and it smells good. I ordered my second</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 of these total here it goes the product itself is awesome. So the first one I ordered came packed with Mud the other two I ordered came with less as if someone took some out. It doesnt come sealed so that doesnt help but they were gifts.</li>
    <li> Works great in one week my skin is clearer</li>
    <li> Ugh I&#x27;m addicted . It leaves my face so fresh . As I wash it off I see the excess brown dirt I missed in my face from regularly washes . But I have dey skin so I would recommend using it 2 times a week</li>
    <li> Great for clearing the pores</li>
    <li> Broke out the day after using it, and the smell of it is very strong... Like perfume.</li>
    <li> did not take my black head away</li>
    <li> First day using this mud mask and so far I love it. I usually know If a mask works for me from my first try and with this mask I felt it was doing its job. Can&#x27;t say too much now but first impression is great. No irritation. It does tingle and sting at first which actually feels good to me And after about 2 min it goes away. East to rinse. Not heavy at all. Satisfied with my purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on my skin. I put mine in the fridge to keep it nice and cool and put it on for 10-15 minutes before I wash it off. My skin feels very smooth and moist afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great deal on good stuff. The feel of it is unlike any other mud mask I&#x27;ve tried from the store and is gentle. My skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful mask! It cleanses and calms down the skin, also leaves moisturising effect.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to wash it from the face.  Great gift idea for Christmas. For sure everyone will love it!</li>
    <li> Love this mud mask! Skins feels and is visibly clear and smooth even after one use. I&#x27;ll be using it twice a week as recommended considering it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin. Small jar but not a lot is needed to cover the face so I think it should last a good while before having to order more. But I&#x27;m def a solid customer so far! Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It does seems authentic, but doesn&#x27;t really live up to the Dead Sea reviews. I&#x27;ve had more effective masks that would actually tighten and moisturize skin. This one just seems to clear pores, which is nice, but I have facial scrubs that can do that.</li>
    <li> While on a trip my husband and I were ambushed by a salesman in a mall. The product was from the dead sea but way overpriced. So when I got home I went on line and found this product. Although I&#x27;ve only used it once it is wonderful. My skin was so soft. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> product is excellent. started using a few days ago and i ordered a 2nd jar to make sure i dont run out</li>
    <li> Love this product. My skin felt smooth and it calmed my rosacea. The seller communicated well and was very professional. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Like my product!  Thank you</li>
    <li> After the first use, my skin was so smooth and bright.  I felt rejuvenated.  I even put it on a mosquito bite; it healed more quickly than usual and the swelling went down faster.</li>
    <li> Im using this product just one week ago and I see the difference in my face. Love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why after applying it, my face is full of pimples. The very next day I had pimple on my forehead. My face was clear before.</li>
    <li> I liked it. Did the job it was supposed to do.</li>
    <li> My skin cleared up after one use. Although small for price, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product...thanks!</li>
    <li> These ingredients are trash. Also the isopropyl palmitate is made from palm oil which is not only causing deforestation, but they are killing the natives, and the wildlife for it. Yes this is still happening in 2015. Also half of the ingredients in this product are TOXIC. On top of all of that it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve never had bad skin, it just tends to look dull from time to time and I wanted a healthy glow. This product did absolutely nothing. I think the people who sell this product are money grubbing monsters. I started using organic lemon juice amd baking soda facials on my skin. It&#x27;s never been more radiant. It&#x27;ll save you money too.</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Works well shipped quick.</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin feels really nice after using this product - It was on my wish list for a long time. Glad i finally gave in!</li>
    <li> Skin feels so soft and clean.  Seems to help control break outs.  WIth a lot of face products my skin usually feels dry afterwards but not with this.  I recommend this to anyone needing something to really deep clean their skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good. I only use it once a week but it makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I went to Israel and to the Dead Sea there twice and I know that nothing can bit real Dead Sea Mud when it comes to skin treatment. I love that this product is actually made in Israel and is all natural. Well, I tried it twice already and can tell that this mask definitely cleanses pores, tightens skin and lifts it up. My face looks healthier and well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;Also, tried it on my bikini area after I shaved it. Every time I shave there, I have severe irritation and I always use concealer if I have to wear bikini at the beach. After the mask the irritation was almost gone and skin was not red any more. So, I guess it&#x27;s a great treatment if you have sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Leaves face feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I love it, one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Some of which were way tooooooo costly.  This is a fantastic bargain.</li>
    <li> I love it! It works great and shipped quickly. I recommend the product and the sellers IdealSkinLab.</li>
    <li> This mud mask is the best in the universe. I say that with all honesty. I just started using it and I already see results no kidding. Of course you have to be persistent . But I love the way it makes my skin feel like its fresh and new. I wish I knew about this a long time ago. I plan to purchase this product again and again.</li>
    <li> bought this for a friend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help reduce the appearance of pores and acne and unfortunately it helped with neither. It did leave my skin very soft after using but only for a day or so.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing so far. Got it in my Xmas stocking and have used it a few times. The smell (not too strong) is luxurious and makes you feel like you&#x27;re in a fancy day spa. It is thick and creamy and feels wonderful. It does make your skin feel great but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see long term results. It came in it&#x27;s own box so packaging was nice and I&#x27;m told it shipped quickly. Five stars if it helps clear up my adult acne. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of pulling out impurities from the skin. Don&#x27;t use right before a major event because it pulls the impurities out and sometimes you get a few blemishes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok makes skin soft that&#x27;s about it. Plus you need a lot to cover face ,very wasteful.</li>
    <li> I watched a show about the Dead Sea and the minerals in the mud. I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. You will NOT be disappointed! It&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before. The mud is thick, but at the same time creamy. I put a little on my face and let dry and then removed with warm water. Immediately I saw a difference! My face was so soft and refreshed! Says made in Israel and also not tested on animals. This is the real deal and I plan on buying more as Christmas gifts for the girls in my family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but it made my skin pretty soft. It didn&#x27;t dry out or burn my face. I will say it&#x27;s disappointing that the directions say to use a lot because I was hoping this little jar would last me a while.</li>
    <li> OMG! I just tried this amazing Dead Sea Mud Mask and loved it so much I ended up talking my brother into trying it! It worked exactly like it said it would. Went on smooth and dried within 10 minuet! I felt like I was at a spa right in the comfort of my own home! Removal was fast and mess free. My face feels absolutely amazing! My skin feels tighter and the red spot I hate are actually less noticeable! My skin feel softer than it has ever felt! I definitely recommend this Dead Sea Mud Mask to Everyone!! Check out my blog for reviews&lt;br /&gt;http://thebeautyinsidethebox.blogspot.com/2015/01/idealskinlab-dead-sea-mud-mask.html?m&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> J&#x27;adore my face and body feel soft.</li>
    <li> I have a dry skin which gets easily irritated especially in winter, so tried this mask to see if it can help. After first use noticed less irritation, and it was not that dry, but I got better results after 3 or 4 consistent applications. Overall, I am satisfied with it, it does what expected.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work at a restaurant and sometimes have double shifts. So, I noticed that my skin started to look stressed and dull. I don&#x27;t have time to go to spa salons, nor do I have time for complex skin care, I need something that I can do on the go, with little time and effort. So, when I saw that you keep this mask on for only 5-10 min, I thought it was right for me. So, I go the shower, wash my face, then apply the mask, I drink my morning coffee while it dries, then wash it off and apply moisturizer and then make up. And wow! my face is bright and fresh as if I just went to a spa! Love it! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great mask, smells good and leaves skin smooth and radiant. Not drying.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and after using it i feel clean and comfortable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It has such a great smell and you barely feel it on your face. It really does the job! I buy different products from amazon all the time and I always read reviews before I do. I have purchased two of these already, one for me and one for my lady. It is the shiznit!!</li>
    <li> seriously, you feel like you are standing in the dead sea smearing mud on your face.  This stuff smells so good ... I&#x27;ve only used it 3 or 4 times so far so can&#x27;t attest to the affect on skin yet but will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! it leaves my skin so soft at least for 2 days. I have only used it twice ( just got it and following the directions of use) so I cant really speak on any other thing it does for my skin. its very thick but goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover, just be kinda quick about it because if it starts to dry and you touch a spot you already applied to it comes off and you have to put more. so far it is something I will definitely order again...oh and I don&#x27;t find there is a smell or a &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; at least nothing that really gets my attention, to me it feels like a normal mud mask, you feel it drying and getting a little tighter that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mud. It&#x27;s cooling, and smells good. Leaves my skin super soft and moisturized. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Is perfect  for my Face I love do two nights por week. Is my spa  in home</li>
    <li> This mask leaves your skin very soft afterward, but with so many added ingredients aside from the Dead Sea mud, I&#x27;m unsure it&#x27;s very effective with pulling out impurities and really cleansing pores. I would prefer just 100% pure mud.</li>
    <li> makes your skin wicked soft. would recommend</li>
