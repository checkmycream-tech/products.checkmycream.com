      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>This dryer is ridiculously light and really powerful.</li>
      <li>For the price my regular blow dryer does just as good a job.  </li>
      <li>It is so much quieter than any dryer I have ever used, it has a unique sound too.</li>
      <li>thank you very much!  </li>
      <li>The hair dryer is super powerful.</li>
      <li>think it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
      <li>Light weight, easy to clean and a long cord.</li>
      <li>but the reviews for other dryers were not that good.</li>
      <li>item arrived well packed and super fast.</li>
      <li>I love the purple and blue</li>
      <li>For this amount of money I would expect it to last longer and for better customer service...</li>

      <li>My hair is dried so quickly and left with a beautiful shine.</li>
      <li>Worth the high cost.</li>
      <li>The wife and I use this product everyday, We are very pleased with its performance.</li>
      <li>I would have easily put down the $329 full price for this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight to handle.</li>
      <li>but I was ready for an upgrade.</li>
      <li>And so fast drying.</li>
      <li>About six months ago I hurt my hand and it was real hard to hold a happy and big and bulky blow dryer, this blow dryer is so LIGHT and sleek</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s pretty lightweight and wasn&#x27;t as hot as my other dryers.  </li>
      <li>I have tried Chi, T3 featherweight, Solano and other expensive hair dryers,  but this one is the best of all of them.  </li>
      <li>I have super thick, super curly, frizzy Indian hair.</li>
      <li>Using bio Ionic brushes helps with soft hairs.</li>
      <li>Since it only cut 4 minutes off of my blow dry time, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the price.</li>
      <li>I went from taking almost an hour to dry my hair and breaking  sweat to drying it in under 20 minutes straight out of the shower and no sweat required.</li>
      <li>So far I like the hair dryer, especially the shortened drying time of my hair.</li>
      <li>I have super long hair (down to my lower back) and always have.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written because this dryer is amazing!! I was skeptical, but I set a timer to see if it would dry my hair faster than my current expensive dryer.  It&#x27;s magical....it dried my long hair (5&amp;#34; past shoulders)  in less than 4 minutes...not sure how it does this, and my hair seems to look better too....less frizz.  I hope it lasts....</li>
    <li> I am very happy with everything. The speed of the shipment. Of course the price.  It is double the price for the same unit at Salon Centric beauty supplies.  So I am more than happy with everything about the product.  The performance, the style, the weight and of course the warranty.  Thank you for everything hope to do more business with you!</li>
    <li> So happy I found this on Amazon!! Saw this on another website and the cost was twice as much, very light and dried my hair fast , works awesome!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is super powerful. It dries my hair in half the time. I have been using the Bio Ionic brand of hair dryers for years: my opinion is that they are the best in the market.&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived well packed and super fast.</li>
    <li> light and dries hair quickly!</li>
    <li> Very light and powerful! Wife is thinking of buying another one for daughter.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer stopped producing heat after 6 months and the manufacturer would not honor the warranty. Seriously flawed.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I have ever used. Very lightweight to handle. I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just got this.  I have super thick, super curly, frizzy Indian hair. It usually takes me around 20 mins just to dry my chin length hair (no kind of styling at all) - this thing got it done in less than 10 mins.  It&#x27;s pretty lightweight and wasn&#x27;t as hot as my other dryers.  I would have easily put down the $329 full price for this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Anyone that has extensions should own this product.  I love how fast I can get my hair dried.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a little expensive for a hair dryer. My wife was going to spend half of this amount but the reviews for other dryers were not that good. She loves this one! Lightweight and gets the job done. No more frizzy hair is what she tells me!</li>
    <li> amazing hair dryer, sephora is selling it for a lot more, dries hair quickly</li>
    <li> lots of expensive hair dryers.  this one actually works.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best purchase I have ever made.  It&#x27;s been about 9 months since I&#x27;ve got it and I still love it.  I am a hair stylist and I can absolutely say it dries hair faster and my shoulder no longer hurts after a 10 hour shift! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I  purchased this as a gift for by husband after reading about it in Good Housekeeping.  He says it is the best dryer he has ever used and asked for a second one for our vacation home.  Am so pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer EVER! I have had the Bio Ionic Nano i5x for the last 5 years, it still works great but I was ready for an upgrade. This dryer is ridiculously light and really powerful. It is so much quieter than any dryer I have ever used, it has a unique sound too. My hair is dried so quickly and left with a beautiful shine. I am SO happy I splurged on this! I caught it when it dropped to $180 and then used the Prime Day  35% off beauty products coupon &#x3D; a steal compared to the retail price!</li>
    <li> Quite. And so fast drying. I have fine hair but a fair amount of it. It drys in under a minute</li>
    <li> I have fine hair texture but a lot of hair.  This dryer dried my hair faster than any dryer I have ever owned.  My hair also looked nicer than when I used other dryers.  I have tried Chi, T3 featherweight, Solano and other expensive hair dryers,  but this one is the best of all of them.  It is also lightweight and comes with a good warranty.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best as it dries quickly, does not burn the scalp or dry out the hair shank. Worth the high cost.</li>
    <li> Light weight.  Dries hair in half the time and there are no frizzies or flyaways.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The wife and I use this product everyday, We are very pleased with its performance. Light weight, easy to clean and a long cord. Great replacement for our old dryer.</li>
    <li> Returned it.  For the price my regular blow dryer does just as good a job.  My regular blow dryer took 16 minutes, this won took 12 minutes.  Since it only cut 4 minutes off of my blow dry time, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I&#x27;ve been a hairdresser for 30 years. About six months ago I hurt my hand and it was real hard to hold a happy and big and bulky blow dryer, this blow dryer is so LIGHT and sleek it just makes working very easy thank you very much!  I love the purple and blue it matches my room perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am not good at in depth reviews but I had to say that this hair dryer saved my hair. I have super long hair (down to my lower back) and always have. I had cheap dryers in the past and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. I went from taking almost an hour to dry my hair and breaking  sweat to drying it in under 20 minutes straight out of the shower and no sweat required. My hair is healthier, shinier, and even straighter. I highly recommend investing in this dryer.</li>
    <li> Getting hot too much but other than that, light and drying fast. Using bio Ionic brushes helps with soft hairs.</li>
    <li> These are the best dryers in the industry and you can&#x27;t beat the 10 year warranty if you use them as much as i do.</li>
    <li> Very light weight and powerful</li>
    <li> this drier is all about the advertising and endorsements, rather than the quality of the unit.  Three &amp;#34;power settings&amp;#34; do not allow independent adjustment of the heat.  Highlighting the energy efficiency of the motor is misleading given the bulk of the power use is in the heating coils</li>
    <li> Quick, light, effective. Fabulous hairdryer!</li>
    <li> OMG!! Love this blow dryer. So light and dries my hair  without the frizz.  Will absolutely buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Greatest hair dryer.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quiet and light...but didn&#x27;t really notice that my drying time was reduced by much...&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
    <li> Performs as seller description. Less than 1pound and faster than any other before. 100% Satisfaction.</li>
    <li> It started out great but then quickly started to stop working as well.  There is only a 15 Day return policy (I wonder why).  I contacted customer service to see if they could do anything and was told I had to figure it out with the manufacturer.  For this amount of money I would expect it to last longer and for better customer service... I would invest my money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> So far I like the hair dryer, especially the shortened drying time of my hair. I like the idea of zero EMF. I am not sure my hair reacts the same as it did with my CHI dryer though. It almost seems that it dries out my hair more and it is not as shiny.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer and brushes ever.  I have fine hair with a mind of it&#x27;s own.  This leaves it smooth, long and silky. It lasts for days, even in this dry CA drought.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer! I am a hairdresser and it does what it says.. And in my business time is money! I love my One pass too! And the style winder is awesome! Bio ionic rocks!</li>
