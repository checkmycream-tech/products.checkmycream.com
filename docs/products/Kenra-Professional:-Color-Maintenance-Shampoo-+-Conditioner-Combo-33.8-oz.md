<li> This shampoo cleanses extremely well (even after an oil treatment) but keeps hair really soft.  </li>
<li> but my hair is still dry on the ends.</li>
<li> When I got it it was open and the cap on the shampoo was half unscrewed and it leaked shampoo.  </li>
<li> and I might as well spent $1 on Suave.</li>
<li> Total waste of money.  </li>
<li> Recommended by my hairdresser, and the price is about half that I&#x27;d expect to pay at the salon.</li>
<li> stiff feeling</li>
<li> however I was uncomfortable with the open product.</li>
<li> I dunno how long this combo Shampoo and conditioner pack have sat on the shelves of this factory but they are giving KENRA a bad name.</li>
<li> NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> Great product at a great price. Will most definitely purchase this way again!</li>
    <li> This product is just like you would get on a salon, only better price!</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered. Ilove it.</li>
    <li> I love Kenra and was happy with the price</li>
    <li> Thanks for the free shipping....but I have used Kenra products in the past and fell in love. So when I found a combo pack I was excited..until I used the product after I received it and was completely upset. I spend more money and care more about my hair than any other product I have and use on any part of my body and I might as well spent $1 on Suave. Even with the oil based that Suave conditioner is, my hair would feel much smoother than the knots and stiff feeling I have gotten from the product I purchased from here. I dunno how long this combo Shampoo and conditioner pack have sat on the shelves of this factory but they are giving KENRA a bad name. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANY PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Kenra color systems maintenance shampoo and conditioner makes my hair very manageable and&lt;br /&gt;easy to take care of.  Makes my hair feel soft .</li>
    <li> Cream Rinse is watery</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t Kenra shampoo, it was something cheap poured in a Kenra bottle.</li>
    <li> THIS IS BEST SHAMPOO IN THE WORLD. AND THANKS TO AMAZON THE PRICE WAS GREAT. I&#x27;LL BUY KENRA PRODUCTS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Arrived in bubble wrap which was originally sealed.  When I got it it was open and the cap on the shampoo was half unscrewed and it leaked shampoo.  I love Kenra products however I was uncomfortable with the open product.</li>

    <li> Love Kenra products, great price on the large sizes!</li>
    <li> Delivered as indicated.</li>
    <li> Great product as a great price for colored hair.  Recommended by my hairdresser, and the price is about half that I&#x27;d expect to pay at the salon.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  Dollar store shampoo and conditioner are better for your hair.  Total waste of money.  It&#x27;s a shame Kenra corporate can&#x27;t stop these sales.</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo and conditioner. Contains no wheat for sensitive heads and the smell is very mild. Have used it for decades.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and keep coming back to Kenra, this is the only product that does not give me a rash on my neck&lt;br /&gt;from all the ingredients they put in shampoos now a days.</li>
    <li> one of the best products ever</li>
    <li> I already use the hairspray and thought I would try the shampoo and conditioner I love it.  Will definately purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo but my hair is still dry on the ends.</li>
    <li> Really like Kenra products.</li>
    <li> Always leaves my hair clean, soft and shiny without any residue and does not damage my hair color.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for maintaining healthy hair even though I use color. My hairdresser is always commenting on the great condition of my hair. I use both Kenra shampoo and conditioner. And I use Kenra hair spray. Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I purchased the Color Systems Maintenance.  I like the regular products better.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleanses extremely well (even after an oil treatment) but keeps hair really soft.  Red-dyes in the hair usually fade the fastest and this product has kept my color going strong until the next coloring.  Well worth the money.  Hint:  you don&#x27;t need a lot!</li>
    <li> This is my go to hair miracle! It always improves the health of my hair.</li>
    <li> I love Kenra products and a plus is they do not test on animals. I rated this a 4 star since I feel that the liter size bottles should come with a pump.</li>
    <li> Used it for years.  Works great.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted at a great price. I like the Kenra products and this was better than anywhere else by 30%.&lt;br /&gt;what more can I say?</li>
