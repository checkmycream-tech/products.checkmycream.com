      <li>This Seller charges an astonishing $3.50 Per Item</li>
      <li>The plates look good, exactly as pictured on site.  </li>
      <li>but once I did the stamp came out perfect it really helps if you have a good stamping polish to get a clean clear stamp and a credit card helps too</li>
      <li>and I used a different plate with a lace design along with it and its beautiful</li>
      <li>BUT Be very aware!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this stamping plate all too often that I&#x27;ve forgotten if this order is now my fourth or fifth purchase LOL.</li>
      <li>For my first design I ended up doing the C&#x27;s on my nails across the bottom and on top</li>
      <li>I did this because I think it will look nice for New Years Eve and my nails usually stay chip proof for about a week so it will be perfect.</li>

      <li>Get compliments everytime I flash the rabbit ;-)</li>
      <li>Click on this link if you&#x27;re interested:</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>, it looks expensive and elegant and if your good at thinking about the right colors to use it can look like you got designer nails, it&#x27;s something I would wear for a night</li>
      <li>image stamps clean and clear.</li>
      <li>oh and also would have appreciated a description to all of them.</li>
      <li>I really think this is a quality product</li>
      <li>, I am really thinking of painting it multicolor (</li>
      <li>thank you for fast shipping but images do not appear.</li>
      <li>I use it often and really like the effect on the nail beds.</li>
      <li>I believe its great how it&#x27;s not just one logo and a bunch of unnecessary stamps on the plate.</li>
      <li>If you adore this stamping plate for the Chanel logo as much as I do, look out for the stamping plate made particularly for Chanel logos.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s good for a little and the big stamps.</li>
      <li>I mainly bought it for the cancer ribbon.</li>
      <li>and so far I have really liked these plates from this seller, it was hard to decide what to stamp first, I like the fact it has an apple on it</li>
      <li>For the price, this plate is highly recommended.</li>
      <li>early 90&#x27;s maybe over gray because then it will really look like a computer, and there&#x27;s the bunny</li>
      <li>(actually the major reason I bought this I collect like everything with that logo from perfumes to jewelery and many other items.)</li>
      <li>When I went to peel off the protective film the \\&quot;LV\\&quot; (which was actually the whole reason I bought this) is scratched OUT right down the middle.</li>
      <li>Need to use thick polish so that you  can get a clean and clear image.  </li>

<li> Find sellers that charge a flat rate fee.</li>
<li> I also bought the other plate from this seller to make the back design.</li>
<li> I doubt I will ever have a use for the other designs on the plate though, not sure why the ribbon was put on a plate with a bunch of high end logos.</li>
<li> I am very active in our local Relay for Life, so I wanted this to stamp purple ribbons on my nails.</li>
<li> Even before the expected date.</li>
<li> It fits Tightly in the Bundle Monster case pockets.  </li>
<li> It took a little practice</li>
<li> Just a partial stamp :(</li>
<li> Stupid how nail plates have such random designs together on one plate</li>
<li> and I AM SO MAD.</li>
<li> Too bad you can&#x27;t use any nail polish, had to be konad.</li>
<li> I am so disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It didn&#x27;t work out for me</li>
    <li> ITS ALL USED. scratches everywhere and I AM SO MAD. lets hope its even useable. The description does not entail a used plate.</li>
    <li> My favorite is the chanel stamp it looks so classy and was easy and clear to stamp without a problem.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stamping plate; all solely for the Chanel logo. I&#x27;ve ordered this stamping plate all too often that I&#x27;ve forgotten if this order is now my fourth or fifth purchase LOL. If you adore this stamping plate for the Chanel logo as much as I do, look out for the stamping plate made particularly for Chanel logos.

    <li> This would have to be my favorite plate of the three I had purchased. I believe its great how it&#x27;s not just one logo and a bunch of unnecessary stamps on the plate. Also, did I mention one of the stamps is chanel which is my fav.</li>
    <li> My plate did not come scratched, just the blue part looks that way...I pulled off the blue and it was perfect I never did nail stamping before so it took me a minute to figure it out but once I did the stamp came out perfect it really helps if you have a good stamping polish to get a clean clear stamp and a credit card helps too, I also bought the Konad double sided Stamper with it and that&#x27;s good for a little and the big stamps. I also bought the other plate from this seller to make the back design.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I received this plate in the mail! When I went to peel off the protective film the \\&quot;LV\\&quot; (which was actually the whole reason I bought this) is scratched OUT right down the middle. Just my luck. I am so disappointed! I hope the seller resolves this issue and gives me a replacement.</li>
    <li> The stamping plate was just what I wanted! It came in record time and I love the way they look on my nails!</li>
    <li> I really have created unique nail art designs w/this plate &amp; would love more designer plates:  example..Gucci, DG, spelled out Coco Channel oh and also would have appreciated a description to all of them.</li>
    <li> As I stated before on the first plate,  these are awesome!!  What a great way to have a designer mani/pedi!!  It works great and looks awesome!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Got this plate just for the cancer ribbon. Lost my oldest sis to cancer and now I run races in her honor. Now I can decorate my nails in her honor too!</li>
    <li> I really think this is a quality product and I would buy it again. Really good!! Loved IT! So happy I got this!</li>
    <li> It took a little practice but I Love it! Too bad you can&#x27;t use any nail polish, had to be konad.</li>
    <li> this stamping plate is great. the stamps are deep enough to pick up and transfer onto the nail. i like these designs</li>
    <li> Love this nail stamp!  Great logos.&lt;br /&gt;Every image stamps clean and clear.</li>

    <li> I was happy to recieve this product, I always wanted the playboy bunny picture, and now I can have playboy bunny nails.</li>
    <li> I purchased this plate specifically for the support ribbon design. I am very active in our local Relay for Life, so I wanted this to stamp purple ribbons on my nails. Works great. I doubt I will ever have a use for the other designs on the plate though, not sure why the ribbon was put on a plate with a bunch of high end logos.</li>
