      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>i got this glitter figuring, it&#x27;s on sale for $2.99 WITH free shipping, worth a try!</li>
      <li>and WOW am I glad I did!</li>
      <li>, colors just as I&#x27;ve expected (great)</li>
      <li>I initially wanted the red (which is also lovely) to put over my lipstick, and decided to get the \\&quot;brilliant silver\\&quot; too-</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping, and free</li>
      <li>and its worth the money.</li>
      <li>This glitter was fun to wear during the holidays .  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;ll be fun to try to find ways to reuse them when the glitter is gone</li>
      <li>I was willing to spend the money on The make up for ever glitter and shimmer but decided to try Zink glitter first!</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>So i just received my 3d glitter in the mail the other day, and i absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>In addition to the fast shipping, this glitter is unbelievably beautiful, sparkling, shimmering, long lasting-</li>
      <li>Reflects 3D Silver I&#x27;d lost on the subway one day last year, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement because it was discontinued.  </li>
      <li>next time, i&#x27;ll order more.</li>
      <li>it is very sparkly which is exactly what I was going for.</li>
      <li>I got this because I was really heartbroken over the MAC</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>/&gt;All new line in 2010!</li>
      <li>it will go very far!  </li>
      <li>It also comes in these adorable little gem-shaped containers-</li>
      <li>it was such fun, but it took a lot.</li>
      <li>It is also great on it&#x27;s own, applied with a base and with one or two other colors around it, it can make for a very sparkly night out.</li>
      <li>Make sure to  use a good base</li>
      <li>It was very affordable at 4.99 and I bought several colors.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, this stuff is amazinggggggggggg and the price is unbelievable!</li>
      <li>They come in this cute little glass bottle, with cork stoppers, that I am going to make pendants from, after the glitter is empty!  </li>
      <li>It stays on, is long lasting and very reflective.  </li>
      <li>The particles aren&#x27;t too large (it is particularly uncomfortable if you have huge pieces of glitter sticking to you like a bunch of wannabe disco balls).</li>
      <li>It is, however, not comparable to the old MAC version which was very brilliantly shiny, holographic chunks of silver in a dark, smoky base.</li>

<li> I have been looking for this type of loose glitter for a long time.</li>
<li> i used a wet eyeshadow brush and patted it onto my eyelids over my eyeshadow</li>
<li> (I do wish the company would provide or offer small cosmetic brushes to go with it, I will definitely need to get one for each color to avoid wasting it)...</li>
<li> I recommend it for those wishing a sparkly eyeshadow that can go on lightly for daily wear or heavily with a base / other shadows for evening.</li>
<li> For other die-hard fans of the \\&quot;Twilight\\&quot; saga, this is what Stephanie Meyer had in mind!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to try the other colors!</li>
<li> By using a small brush I layered it over my usual eye shadow and this made my eyes pop!</li>
<li> i have it for like 6 months and hardly made a dent in the bottle.</li>

    <li> I just recived Vintage Bronze this am.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 7 hours now.  It still hasn&#x27;t faded.  And It went on without it falling into the corners of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I also recieved a sample of Majestic Blue.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s great business ehtics.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the samples. And I look forward to buying more cool, colors in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Wishes,&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly Owen</li>
    <li> There is a good reason this product gets so many 5 star ratings - its AWESOME! In addition to the fast shipping, this glitter is unbelievably beautiful, sparkling, shimmering, long lasting- its perfect!! It also comes in these adorable little gem-shaped containers- it&#x27;ll be fun to try to find ways to reuse them when the glitter is gone (perhaps I will keep my diamond earrings in them!). I initially wanted the red (which is also lovely) to put over my lipstick, and decided to get the \\&quot;brilliant silver\\&quot; too- and WOW am I glad I did! This is the most stunning cosmetic sparkle I&#x27;ve ever seen! For other die-hard fans of the \\&quot;Twilight\\&quot; saga, this is what Stephanie Meyer had in mind! If I could bathe in this stuff and play a Cullen for the rest of my life, I would!  :-P  (I do wish the company would provide or offer small cosmetic brushes to go with it, I will definitely need to get one for each color to avoid wasting it)... If you want to sparkle and shine like a pixie Goddess, GET THIS GLITTER!! I will be ordering it in all colors regularly for as long as this company is around (which I pray is forever!) Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> i got this glitter figuring, it&#x27;s on sale for $2.99 WITH free shipping, worth a try! and i am SO glad that i did!!!! the glitter looks beautiful and seems to be very good quality.  i used a wet eyeshadow brush and patted it onto my eyelids over my eyeshadow and i can&#x27;t get over how beautiful it is.</li>
    <li> I love it so much its a good quality . Its sparkle and shine ... I will order it again....thanks</li>

    <li> I love this glitter. it is very sparkly which is exactly what I was going for. I put it over a tiny bit of liquid eyeshadow for a pop of sparkle and it stays all night. great for nails too!</li>
    <li> I just received these today (I purchased three different coloured glitters) and they are so awesome!  They come in this cute little glass bottle, with cork stoppers, that I am going to make pendants from, after the glitter is empty!  But, I will be ordering more!  They are not only sparkly for your makeup, and hair, but you can mix them in perfume oils or body lotions, and shimmer all over!  Very fast shipping, and free, too, these days, that is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;  I rate the seller and product, 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, ZinK Colour, I will be back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara, Owner, the Enchanted Mirror Store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Custom Stevie Nicks style clothing, jewelry, and accessories.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;All new line in 2010!</li>
    <li> i love this glitter. Its so brillant. Great on eyes or even on nails! Ive gotten some great depth looks with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best glitter that I have bought yet.  It stays on, is long lasting and very reflective.  I will only buy this brand from now on!  Very happy...</li>
    <li> it came in such a small little case, but yu dont need much to spread around. i have it for like 6 months and hardly made a dent in the bottle. the packaging is good. i have no reason to complain about it. but if yu want some pretty glitter all over, get it!!! and its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love mixing this glitter in my eye shadow it gives my eyes a bit of shine. it is a very fine glitter and works well.</li>
    <li> Another great color I love their glitter its sticks really good and it wont fall off the whole day &lt;3 I will be purchasing many more thanks guys</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to say that today I&#x27;ve got my purchaises from Zink Color. I&#x27;ve requested 6 zink color glitter. Tubs and quantity are very good, colors just as I&#x27;ve expected (great) and they kept on for a long time on my face. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> So i just received my 3d glitter in the mail the other day, and i absolutely love it! It even has a piece of paper in the package saying i can receive free eyeshadow if i sent feedback(: so i&#x27;m hoping for that too:D i just don&#x27;t know how that works.</li>
    <li> I got this because I was really heartbroken over the MAC Reflects 3D Silver I&#x27;d lost on the subway one day last year, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement because it was discontinued.  It is good, very light holographic eyeshadow. It is, however, not comparable to the old MAC version which was very brilliantly shiny, holographic chunks of silver in a dark, smoky base. The adherence of the MAC version to the eye area is greater as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the Zink version does have it&#x27;s place. the lightness and fineness of the product makes it wonderfully mixable with other eyeshadows for a nice effect. It is also great on it&#x27;s own, applied with a base and with one or two other colors around it, it can make for a very sparkly night out. I recommend it for those wishing a sparkly eyeshadow that can go on lightly for daily wear or heavily with a base / other shadows for evening. Very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE COLOR! It really is very beautiful</li>
    <li> this is a beautiful glitter!  i thought it was larger but for glitter tip rock star gel nails it will go very far!  i&#x27;m very excited!</li>
    <li> This glitter was fun to wear during the holidays .  It was very affordable at 4.99 and I bought several colors.  Purchase some type of glitter glue to help stay on.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for cosmetic grade glitter for eyes - this is the BEST! Make sure to  use a good base and it will stay forever!</li>
    <li> I got this when looking for glitter that I could use for face painting. It&#x27;s noticeable, but not gaudy. The particles aren&#x27;t too large (it is particularly uncomfortable if you have huge pieces of glitter sticking to you like a bunch of wannabe disco balls). It sticks well and doesn&#x27;t clump easily like some others do. It&#x27;s very easy to apply with either a brush or by sprinkling. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> we just this for fairy gel. it was such fun, but it took a lot. next time, i&#x27;ll order more. this glitter is quite fine.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this type of loose glitter for a long time. Completely happy, and will continue to buy it :]</li>
