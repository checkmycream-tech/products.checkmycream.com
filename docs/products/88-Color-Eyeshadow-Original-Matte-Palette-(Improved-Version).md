      <li>They are pigmented and they are amazing.</li>
      <li>They work best if you use a primer on the eyelids (as do all eye shadows) but rhe colours are very pigmented.  </li>
      <li>Nice color and pigmetation.</li>
      <li>Great product and many different colors you can choose from, and one of the best things about this product is that you can mix and match.</li>
      <li>well i have to give this product a 4 star because i do love the amazing color variety it gives you like the amazing neon pinks and yellows</li>
      <li>All shadows have good pigmentation but some of the lighter shades are powdery but all of the colors are fairly easy to blend.  </li>
      <li>Love love!</li>
      <li>The kit has a rainbow of bright, vivid colors as well as a fair amount of neutrals, and all of them apply gorgeously.  </li>
      <li>This is more got beginners</li>
      <li>or I would be even more upset.</li>
      <li>Which is ok-</li>
      <li>There are a handful that are more shimmer, but the majority are truly matte.</li>
      <li>I love the colors</li>
      <li>I LOVE this palette.</li>

      <li>The packaging was outstanding.</li>
      <li>I opened it, and immediately fell in love.</li>
      <li>I love how diverse this palette is.  </li>
      <li>I prefer matte eyeshadows, and I love that this palette has so many options.</li>
      <li>Great colors, got it fast, just not pigmented at all.</li>
      <li>but they are more than workable and useable for any makeup wearer or artist.</li>
      <li>Lots of color variety and the quality of the shadows isn&#x27;t top grade</li>
      <li>But I must say I love it..</li>
      <li>Love, love this product.</li>
      <li>To get more pigment, spray your brush with finishing spray or water.</li>
      <li>My tween daughter was VERY excited to receive this as a gift.</li>
      <li>They are great quality and highly pigmented.  </li>
      <li>All shadows are the size of a dime, the palette has warm, cool and neutral colors.</li>
      <li>One of my best buys in Beauty/Cosmetics in a long time.</li>
      <li>I thought the quality would be better but now seeing that I paid a relatively cheap price for it</li>
      <li>The colors are easy to apply and blend well.  </li>
      <li>the colors are just amazing, i wear it out all the time,the good thing about it is that it has all the colors i like in only one palette</li>
      <li>In general, however, this palette is fun to play with and gives you a lot of great basics as well as a lot of fun, bright, on trend colors that you can experiment with, and the palette is a great value considering that many brands charge the same amount for one or two shadows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great palette for photo shoots, if you&#x27;re interested in this palette, don&#x27;t want to spend too much and want matte shades, don&#x27;t hesitate and get it.  </li>
      <li>I love this palate so much!!</li>
      <li>Love it sooo much!</li>
      <li>for this being improved, I don&#x27;t know how it stands up to the original as I&#x27;ve never had the chance to use the original 88 matte palette.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product and I am certainly interested and will be purchasing more products from BHcosmetics.</li>
      <li>This, however, is a very good value for the money and it definitely is a good deal, even if you only use a few colors.  </li>
      <li>Great product and exactly as expected.</li>
      <li>I use a lot of the bright colors for theatrical makeup.  </li>
      <li>love all these colors..they are very vibrant and bold...</li>
      <li>The colors are true to what you see and you can blend them.</li>
      <li>I love the color choices, Its just I don&#x27;t like how I have to take so much time to build my color.</li>
      <li>Colors are good enough quality for girls playing with make-up or practicing techniques  and</li>
      <li>in all, you really can&#x27;t find a better deal for the amount of variety found in this palette.  </li>
      <li>Overall, good palette for the price</li>
      <li>There is a good variety in this palette, I use it almost daily.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PALETTE SO MUCH</li>
      <li>However, the price was not bad.</li>
      <li>and the colors are not bad</li>
      <li>go on easily, better used with an eye primer to make them stand out better (and last longer).  </li>
      <li>Pigments or colours are bright and they stay on long with out creasing.</li>
      <li>Love this product colors are so vivid and stand out.  </li>
      <li>I received EXACTLY what i wanted!</li>
      <li>First of all I recieved my package 2 days after I ordered it!</li>
      <li>so i use a light concealer plus eyeshadow primer to really get color.</li>
      <li>The colors are nice, they are smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t own a lot of colorful eye shadows, so this helps switch up my looks occasionally.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that the palette has ingredients of the shadows listed on the back of the palette.  </li>
      <li>mix some colors and have fun</li>
      <li>Some are better than other but I still love it.</li>
      <li>I just received this palette in the mail today, delivery was pretty quick.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need too much to achieve a great look (though if you were trying to do a drag look or a halloween look, you&#x27;d need more, obviously).  </li>
      <li>SUPER FAST RIGHT?</li>
      <li>Prices are very reasonable for quality as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, especially because matte shadows are less available.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Package came intact and the colors are beautiful.  I use these shadows with my urban decay primer.  I&#x27;m happy, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. I received EXACTLY what i wanted! Nothing damaged or anything like that. I&#x27;m thinking about buying another with just neutrals!</li>
    <li> 5 of my circles were every where jingle it even in a few colors but since it was minor I just placed it back.not off to a good start. I still gave it 3 stars just because the package came as expected</li>
    <li> Great product and many different colors you can choose from, and one of the best things about this product is that you can mix and match.Five Stars!</li>
    <li> well i have to give this product a 4 star because i do love the amazing color variety it gives you like the amazing neon pinks and yellows you really cant find anywhere else. also i love that not all are matte however some people may like only matte so if you want all matte this may not be your palette. the pigmentation could be a bit better not the best. if you use this color alone there will not be a lot of pigmentation so i use a light concealer plus eyeshadow primer to really get color. hopefully this helps!</li>
    <li> I was very happy that my item arrived within two business days, but I was disappointed when I received it and saw how poorly pacakged the product was. As I began to open it I saw that there was blue eyeshadow all over the bubble wrap and the black case. Once I opened it, one of the blue eyeshadows had cracked and was all over the place. What a mess that was to clean up! So I was highly dissapointed. Good thing I got it for a steal or I would be even more upset.</li>
    <li> First of all I recieved my package 2 days after I ordered it! 2 DAYS!! SUPER FAST RIGHT? I was nervous about the package being broken or messed up in any way because of all the reviews I read on here but man! It was perfectly wrapped in Bubble Wrap and plastic to prevent it from shaking about in the box. My eyeshadows are intack! The colors are awesome and the payoff is amazing! I &lt;3 this palette and if you are reading this then you should deff get it! :o)</li>
    <li> I got this palate today! It came so fast 5 whole days early!! I love this palate so much!! This is more got beginners and it is quite smaller than I expected but it&#x27;s still perfect (: It lasts for 24 months if you were wondering like I was</li>
    <li> This product came in good condition with no cracked eyeshadows 👍🏾</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors. To get more pigment, spray your brush with finishing spray or water. Always use an eyeshadow base and eye primer for best results.</li>
    <li> I got my Eyeshadow today and it was intact, i was afraid that it might get broken but it was package well and i got them on time...... I love the colors and i cant wait to start using it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this pallet on the 19th, and received it on the 22nd! That alone automatically impressed me. The packaging was outstanding. I opened it, and immediately fell in love. I did a few color swatches and knew right away it was money well spent. If you&#x27;re looking for a ton of colors at an affordable price, this is definitely a great choice. There are a few shades such as the pinks that I would recommend using a good primer with. Overall,  I really have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Great colors, got it fast, just not pigmented at all. You have to wet the brush a bit but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This is a basic palette, and for ten bucks the colors are decently pigmented. I remember using one of these back in high school so i picked another one up. I don&#x27;t own a lot of colorful eye shadows, so this helps switch up my looks occasionally.</li>
    <li> When I received the (88 matte eyeshadow) palette I noticed not all of the shadows are matte. But you can actually see the shimmery shadows in the pictures posted by the seller if you look close enough. The green, blue, and purple shadows are not very pigmented but can be somewhat built up. The pink shadows and brown shadows are decent though. Overall, good palette for the price</li>
    <li> I love how diverse this palette is.  It is perfect for encompassing colors that you wear rarely but still use.  The individual shadows are small so you they will not expire before you use them. They are great quality and highly pigmented.  I use a lot of the bright colors for theatrical makeup.  The palette is thin and therefore not bulky at all.  Plus, you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> BH Cosmetics has made a great value palette with a ton of great matte shades for your makeup kit.  The kit has a rainbow of bright, vivid colors as well as a fair amount of neutrals, and all of them apply gorgeously.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with streaky, uneven application, as the formula has a thickness that causes the color to adhere.  I definitely recommend some sort of eye primer as the colors can dry and flake a bit as time passes (this is true of any eyeshadow, not particular to this palette).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pans are a little smaller than the size of a dime, but a little goes a long way and there are 88 options for you to play around with.  The only downside is that if you find a color you fall in love with and use it down to the pan, the only way to get that same color is to buy the same palette.  In general, however, this palette is fun to play with and gives you a lot of great basics as well as a lot of fun, bright, on trend colors that you can experiment with, and the palette is a great value considering that many brands charge the same amount for one or two shadows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add it to your kit and play with it; as you discover the colors you have to have and want to invest in, you can find similar colors in larger sizes from other brands.  It&#x27;s a great starter for anyone just learning about makeup as well!</li>
    <li> Love it sooo much! You get so much for the verylow and affordable price. COLORS are extremley pigmented and last all day</li>
    <li> Love this product colors are so vivid and stand out.  None of the product was broken when it arrived well packaged.  I would recommend</li>
    <li> It came 2 days early.  Well packed for shipping.  The colours are great. Some look like they have shimmer but once they are one they are matte. They work best if you use a primer on the eyelids (as do all eye shadows) but rhe colours are very pigmented.  Will definitely buy other palates.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife, who had one of these previously and left it at a hotel. Great product and exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> The product comes in a relatively small black box, and once you open it, you see the large collection of colors you were waiting for.  They&#x27;re all about dime-sized, and it makes sense, considering the small size of the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go on easily, better used with an eye primer to make them stand out better (and last longer).  You don&#x27;t need too much to achieve a great look (though if you were trying to do a drag look or a halloween look, you&#x27;d need more, obviously).  This is a matte shadow palette, but there is about 10 shimmering eyeshadows, so it isn&#x27;t entirely matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this being improved, I don&#x27;t know how it stands up to the original as I&#x27;ve never had the chance to use the original 88 matte palette.  This, however, is a very good value for the money and it definitely is a good deal, even if you only use a few colors.  It&#x27;s a great deal for an up-and-coming makeup artist (professionals would probably want a higher quality shadow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you really can&#x27;t find a better deal for the amount of variety found in this palette.  It&#x27;s a great deal, especially because matte shadows are less available.</li>
    <li> The pigments are great and they wear really well, but one of my highlight colors were broken when I recieved it. Which is ok- because I still got a good deal on the palette anyway. I LOVE this palette.</li>
    <li> Eyeshadow colors  are Vivid, Bold and Blended ,then if use a base or concealer makes it pop even more. Am deep skin tone and colors show true on me,LUV  it,A Must-HAVE!!!</li>
    <li> Palette has a lot of colors just not typical or basic colors. I expected some basic colors to be mixed in as well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this palette to be very good. But I must say I love it.. It has nice colors!! Some are better than other but I still love it. The packaging was good nothing broken. It came in great condition. Love love!</li>
    <li> My tween daughter was VERY excited to receive this as a gift. Colors are good enough quality for girls playing with make-up or practicing techniques  and case is durable enough to keep the colors in place without breaking apart. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got this palate cheaper than the advertised offer on the actual cosmetics website. I&#x27;ve got to buy the shimmer palate next.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice, they are smaller than I thought they would be. They are pigmented and they are amazing.</li>
    <li> The colors are quite pigmented, especially when used with an eye primer.  The colors are easy to apply and blend well.  There is a good variety in this palette, I use it almost daily.</li>
    <li> Mine got here in one piece, was packaged well.Not even one of the colors was broken.Arrived on time and well pigmented.I&#x27;m sooo happy</li>
    <li> Great make up palette, great for beginners. It was shipped on time and all in one piece....keep up the good work</li>
    <li> Really great price for this palette at just $11.  All shadows have good pigmentation but some of the lighter shades are powdery but all of the colors are fairly easy to blend.  All shadows are the size of a dime, the palette has warm, cool and neutral colors. It&#x27;s portable and the perfect size for travel and storage.  Palette comes with two double ended sponge applicators and a nice sized mirror, definitely as pictured and described.  It&#x27;s nice that the palette has ingredients of the shadows listed on the back of the palette.  This is a great palette for photo shoots, if you&#x27;re interested in this palette, don&#x27;t want to spend too much and want matte shades, don&#x27;t hesitate and get it.  One of my best buys in Beauty/Cosmetics in a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the color choices, Its just I don&#x27;t like how I have to take so much time to build my color. I have dark skin and I figured the bright colors would pop, but I have to put layer upon layer of make up on just so it shows up. I was looking for the palette to pack a bigger punch, not make my skin look dry and ashy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PALETTE SO MUCH</li>
    <li> Nice color and pigmetation.</li>
    <li> I prefer matte eyeshadows, and I love that this palette has so many options. There are a handful that are more shimmer, but the majority are truly matte.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about the package was there was a thin layer of powder over the palette and when I checked the palette I realized that one of the eyeshadow colors was cracked up and broken up. I was a bit disappointed because I thought maybe BHCostmetics would have fixed that problem or make sure it doesn&#x27;t happen consistently. I bought this palette because the eyeshadows are vibrant and last longer. I am dark-skinned so I was looking for a proper eyeshadow palette that will show the colors vibrantly without fading too quickly. I read other reviews and saw that other customers had similar a similar problem when their packages arrived either one of the shadows were broken. However, the price was not bad. To repair the broken eyeshadow I found an eyeshadow repair method on youtube. Would have been 5 stars but just because it had that issue, I give this review 4.5 stars.</li>
    <li> Lots of color variety and the quality of the shadows isn&#x27;t top grade but they are more than workable and useable for any makeup wearer or artist.</li>
    <li> only received this product about 2 weeks ago and already started using it for day time and night time looks. Pigments or colours are bright and they stay on long with out creasing. I always use a primer with eyeshadows. I would recommend this product and I am certainly interested and will be purchasing more products from BHcosmetics. Prices are very reasonable for quality as well.</li>
    <li> I just received this palette in the mail today, delivery was pretty quick. I thought the quality would be better but now seeing that I paid a relatively cheap price for it I should have thought about it twice. The eye shadows do not show up very well without a primer and one of them was broken. I thought about returning it but it&#x27;s definitely usable though so I decided to keep it. Beats paying $50 for a palette lol.</li>
    <li> Amazing and beautiful. Got it on time and fast. Nothing in the palette was destroyed and the colors are perfect ♡</li>
    <li> Love, love this product. Not a high end product but it will get the job done-especially for the price.</li>
    <li> the colors are just amazing, i wear it out all the time,the good thing about it is that it has all the colors i like in only one palette</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful. The quality is good too! The colors are true to what you see and you can blend them. I recommend!</li>
    <li> love all these colors..they are very vibrant and bold...i use this shadow everyday and i have not been let down since i first used it.</li>
    <li> the shadow came packaged well nothing broken and the colors are not bad no complaints i will use it this weekend for my anniversary mix some colors and have fun i will have an update soon</li>
