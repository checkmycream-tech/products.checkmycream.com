      <li>My feet feel so much more healthy.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and it never need batteries.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad he doesn&#x27;t use his knife anymore to scrape off the skin ickkkk</li>
      <li>I work from home and tend to stay barefooted most of the day which causes my feet to be rougher.</li>
      <li>Just let it lay onto the foot and it works better.  </li>
      <li>I also saw that they now have the one with a cord, but I didn&#x27;t want to have to be attached to a socket because I like to do my pedicure while I watch my favorite shows.</li>
      <li>My feet are so smooth now!</li>
      <li>It is better for the environment</li>
      <li>if you have nice smooth feet that won&#x27;t be a problem for you.  </li>
      <li>Very worth the investment and too, because replacement buffing heads can be ordered and it&#x27;s rechargeable!</li>
      <li>The device was still working good when I finished the first pedicure.</li>
      <li>So worth the money!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Earlier I wrote the followig review: My feet love this gadget. My wife says; You look shorter. Have you been grinding your feet again?! Yes, it works great, though I might buy the rougher rollers to start of the harder parts and then go to the original roller for the fine work. My feet feel so much more healthy.  And that review hold a true for the first half year. But then it looses power quickly and you only get one foot done on a charge. Great concept. Poor product if it fails after half a year. I bough the cabled version, the power one. That even has less power than the rechargeable version.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool&lt;br /&gt;Does an excellent job of removing clauses and dry skin.I would recommend this to anyone who goes bare foot and skin dries out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present for my cousin. I have had one for several years and I love it. It removes calluses easily and painlessly. When she recently told me her foot doctor removedem a callous from her foot with a razor I knew right then what to get her for Christmas.</li>
    <li> excellent. buy yours today!</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised. Very good power. Only thing missing is a flashing light when fully charged. Light stays solid while charging so you never know when it is complete. Over time this could lead to the &amp;#34;memory effect&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great callous removal for my old 67 year old feet.</li>
    <li> Made a huge difference!!! So easy to use!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and some accessories a few weeks ago. It was shipped on time and arrived in very good condition. I have used the Emjoi Callus Remover several times over the past Month and I am very please to say that it has exceeded my expectations. I am on on my feet a lot during the day and my feet and heels crack and get really dry and rough to the touch sometimes. I have tried using other products and devices to end in disappointment, But after using the Emjoi on my feet and heels several times, It has really improved the look and feel of my feet tremendiously. Thank you so much Emjoi and Amazon...!</li>
    <li> I love the Micro Pedi cant do without it</li>
    <li> Wife bought it for mother-in-law.  Though not cheap, it&#x27;s well worth it since replacing batteries would be an endless cost.  This is a better alternative and should last much longer.  Mother-in-law loves it too.</li>
    <li> Love This So Far!  I just received it for Christmas, so, not much use yet.</li>
    <li> Love it. My feet and heels are smooth and look great.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Found it works great on my feet and my hubby was impressed (difficult to do) with it as well. Would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> This is perfect to smoothe very dry skin on your feet.  I also use the attachments (may or may not be included;can&#x27;t remember) when I give myself a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I have heavy calluses on my feet and this is the best remedy I have found.  My feet look better than they have in a long time after using this device once a week for a month.  That being said, here are the cons:  The discs don&#x27;t last very long on my feet....and they are fairly expensive to replace........if you have nice smooth feet that won&#x27;t be a problem for you.  Of course if you have nice smooth feet, you don&#x27;t need this to begin with.  I also have some concerns about the battery life.......it will run approximately 20 minutes before slowing down which is enough time.  However, my concern is that with most rechargeables, each recharge lasts fewer minutes.......how many charges will I get before it is needing to be recharged after five minutes.  Time will give the answer I suppose.  I will try to remember to update this after a few months of use because I do plan to continue using this device and would recommend it to those who have tried everything else.  Its not perfect, but will improve your feet greatly with time and patience.</li>
    <li> I think this product will work over time and with some patience.  After using it several times, I decided to try the gray super coarse refill rollers, and that seems to be hastening the process a little.  This doesn&#x27;t take off as much callous each time as my Ped Egg did,  but although it is a slower process, it also seems gentler.  It does make more of a mess, since the powdered callous just blows off, rather than being trapped somewhere.  I will update this after more use, as it will take more time to accurately evaluate.</li>
    <li> It worked great for the first couple of uses but it starts to not be as strong an exfoliant of dead skin on your heals.</li>
    <li> This is very convenient, it does all of the work for you, with hard and scaly feet, you&#x27;d do right to have a mechancal machine do the work, otherwise you&#x27;d spend a good hour taking care of your feet, what this device can do in about 10-15 minutes.  Very worth the investment and too, because replacement buffing heads can be ordered and it&#x27;s rechargeable!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he loves it.  He used to go to the nail parlor with me and now he says there is no need he can&#x27;t stop using it. He gives it 5 stars would give it more for sure.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for the wife and she loves it. Needed initial charge before use but was worth the wait. Rollers are removable for cleaning and change easily. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tool. I work from home and tend to stay barefooted most of the day which causes my feet to be rougher. the last few times I went to the spa to get a pedicure, I was disappointed in the results after paying for  callus treatment. I have little skin tags on my feet that i developed during my pregnancy with my first child.  This foot file  works great on smoothing out my feet and getting rid of  those tags. I was amazed and honestly a little disgusted at how much dead skin dust  accumulated after filing each foot. I bought 2 more of these as christmas presents for my mom and my Aunt!</li>
    <li> Works ok dont have much power</li>
    <li> WEAK...this product will take off only a small amount of hardened foot skin, but not ALL of it like a pedi-egg will. It removed maybe 20% of the foot skin per foot for me... Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Works GREAT! Love it, makes your feet so soft.</li>
    <li> Really love it, very pleased!</li>
    <li> Works very well for maintenance between pedicures. Smooths out callus without going too deep into tissue. I wish charge lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful callus remover; my feet just after one use look &amp; feel great; so wish I would have heard about this years ago.  Other reviews are correct you do not need to press hard against your feet; just let the roller the work &amp; a soft toothbrush works great on cleaning the roller than that dinky little brush they put in the box.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! Very strong battery. Removes old skin quickly but has no effect on healthy skin. Leaves you with a very soft polished foot! You will love this product!</li>
    <li> The rollers slow when I push down even at medium strength.  Given that it&#x27;s  a wall-plug device, I expected  more power from this. If you order this, I advise getting coarser rollers to help make up for the weak engine.</li>
    <li> This works amazing. It&#x27;s like the best pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had in terms of taking care of dry, excess skin.  I didn&#x27;t even have to charge it first to use it… I just plugged it in and went to town.  My came with only two rollers, but I&#x27;ve seen other packages which have more, so you might want to look for those.  I got this for myself and one for my Mom for Mother&#x27;s Day.  Best gift ever. :)  Puts other foot files, pedi eggs, and the like to shame.</li>
    <li> My feet are so smooth now! Much better then using the old methods.... This is a must have.</li>
    <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries!! It is better for the environment and I know that when I need to use it its charged and ready to go! I originally had the battery operated one and the batteries ended up leaking inside the machine and I didn&#x27;t even know it until I went to change the batteries and got acid on my hands from it. When I went to replace it, because I can&#x27;t live without this great little machine, I saw this rechargeable one for a little more money. The cost in not having to replace batteries will eventually make up the difference in the price. I also saw that they now have the one with a cord, but I didn&#x27;t want to have to be attached to a socket because I like to do my pedicure while I watch my favorite shows. This is a great purchase and well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!! He uses it all the time and the buffer rollers seem to be doing their job. I&#x27;m glad he doesn&#x27;t use his knife anymore to scrape off the skin ickkkk</li>
    <li> Product does an excellent job removing callous from feet.  Makes feet feel smooth.  I&#x27;m able to use at least two or three times before recharging.</li>
    <li> I love mine, which is not rechargeable, and bought this one as a gift to my daughter in law.  She loves it as much as I do.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on dry callused feet</li>
    <li> I have very dry feet and was going 1-2 times per month for a pedicure...not any more, this little gaget is the bomb and in 1 months time will pay for itself. My feet after 1 week are smooth and very soft...Thank you Emjoi..you will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> It works. I love when you buy something and it actually works. What more can you ask for. Totally Awesome!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it!  She said of all the ways she has tried to keep her feet smooth and soft this is by far the fastest and easiest way she has ever been able to do it.  She also said that this has returned her feet to the softness and smoothness of her youth and I concur!</li>
    <li> Perfect pedicure for those summer sandal feet! I used this all summer, and it was great. Easily charges, and I was even able to pop out the filing-round, rises the file, and let it dry... worked liked a new file! I haven&#x27;t had to use any replacement files yet. Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife has died &amp; gone to heaven....she loves this thing...I can&#x27;t get her to turn it off!  Her feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for an works like a dream.  My heels and a couple of other places on my feet are cracked and calloused all the time.  Pedicures help for a short time, but sometimes they don&#x27;t take off enough or take off too much.  The cheese grater device sometimes left my heels still rough, but feeling like I had taken a grinder to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product quickly smoothed out the rough spots and left my feet feeling smoother than they ever have.  I woke up the next morning and realized I could no longer scratch my leg with my rough, calloused heel!  What a great discovery.  I have told everyone about this.  I am so happy i found something that works perfectly for me, and takes me no time.  So i won&#x27;t mind when I have to do it again.  Over a week later, still loving the results!</li>
    <li> Looking forward to smooth feet !</li>
    <li> Great stuff (actually the 1st thing that it does what it says what I&#x60;ve ever bought) It gets the job done! I would absolutely recomment it to others!!</li>
    <li> I uses this in between my spa visit.  It&#x27;s Amazing.  Use on dry feet.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my wife which she just loves.  Now, she can get rid of all those other &amp;#34;implements&amp;#34; that was needed to do what this one machine can do in a fraction of the time.  She says is does a better job, cleaner and more effortlessly.  Good call on my part, got a &amp;#34;atta boy&amp;#34; out of it!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Did have to purchase the coarser rollers.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give a full evaluation as it has only been used a couple times. So far though, I like it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I am so glad I went ahead and got this thing. So far I am very pleased with it. I had very dry feet with thick callouses that where cracking around the heel. I used my egg  foot grater thing but it took so long and so much effort. My feet kept re-cracking it got very painful, s I bought this. It did not bog down it was fast and very easy to use. My feet have never been so smooth. its only been a week and the cracks are almost completely healed. I do have to warn you that you will need to turn off any fans in the room and  to vacuum afterward. It was like a belt sander on dry wood! Next time im going outside to sand my feet!</li>
    <li> This is the first callus remover I&#x27;ve tried that actually does the job...quickly and easily removes dry, cracked skin.  I am grateful to no longer live with painful, cracked calluses on my heels.  What a relief!</li>
    <li> It ceased functioning after three short periods of operation.</li>
    <li> My rough feet wears out the roller quick.</li>
    <li> Much better than the egg shaped remover I used to use. The handle is easy to hold and the head is angled just right for most any part of the foot.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tool. I have over the years taken care of my feet in a variety of ways, but this did the finest job compared with any other. I have used blades, files, the egg, exfoliating creams, scrubs. Nothing got rid of a certain place on the side of my big toe. and that place always hurts. this things got rid of it. i am so happy. i will never use another thing. i used it in some places on my fingers, too.</li>
    <li> To all the people who claim the Emjoi Pedi doesn&#x27;t work...you need to do a few treatments.&lt;br /&gt;If you put a dark towel down and use it, you&#x27;ll see the (yucky) proof that this does remove A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much nicer to be able to treat my feet at home instead of an expensive pedi at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very highly recommend it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It works great  I ordered the coarse rollers for my husband&#x27;s feet which are very rough and it does the job.  So happy I learned about this product.  The hand sanders I used to use  just don&#x27;t do the job and are difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I waited almost two months before posting my review. I wanted to make sure I had used the Emjoi Micro-Pedi enough to make a fair judgment. I see several reviewers posting after just one use and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an objective and fair review for both the product and the users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally wanted to buy the corded version, but it wasn&#x27;t available and ended up buyin the rechargeable which I am happy with. It has enough power to do both feet without a problem. Though I do regarge it after each use so I have it ready for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really bad feet, and my only viable option was professional pedicure. All other home products I&#x27;ve bought before were never enough and really did not do the job, so I was stuck spending money every month in my pedicure. No more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Emjoi Micro-Pedi every week for the past seven weeks. At first I was not impressed, my feet looked better but not as good as I wanted to. I kept going once a week, 10 to 15 minutes each foot and finishing with a good amount of coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in years I am able to wear sandals all month without embarrassment or waiting for my next pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are really no miracle products, there are only products that work or don&#x27;t work. The secret with Emjoi Micro-Pedi is persistence and patience. It DOES work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you do not over do an area, you could end up hurting your feet, move it constantly and do not stop at any area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to cartridges, the instruction booklet said not to rinse or put them under water. Sorry but I did it! I rinse the cartridges after each use and let them dry throughly. They have lasted for about three uses. You do have to order new ones eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about cracked feet: Emjoi Micro-Pedi will not &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; cracks in your ankles. It will only get rid of excess dry skin. You still have to use a daily mosturizer to deal with cracked ankles. I have found coconut oil to be the best. I use it onece a week on the day I do my home pedi; a generous amount all over my feet and wear some old socks for about an hour to let the oil penetrate my skin. On a daily basis I use foot cream designed for clacked ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final note: I don&#x27;t like 5 star reviews, just as I don&#x27;t like 1 star review. I wanted to find something I didn&#x27;t like about Emjoi Micro-Pedi in order to make me give it 4 stars, but I really did not find anything I didn&#x27;t like. In fact I love it!!! That is why I gave it 5 stars, I had to be fair to Emjoi and to you.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I received it for Christmas and have used it 3 times already. My feet needed a bit of TLC. My husband has used it and loves it as well. It takes quite a bit to impress him. If your feet are in pretty rough shape, I suggest getting the green rolllers to go with this. The rollers included are for feet that need TLC but not an extreme make-over! I will be buying this for all 4 of my daughters and my sister.</li>
    <li> Love, love, 💘 and love my micro-pedi!!!!!!!!! I Nebo get thought I would be able to do this without spending $30 a week for a pedicure. Saving some serious cash now!</li>
    <li> I previously tried a lower priced As Seen On TV product that claimed to miraculously remove calluses.  I can assure you it did NOT have the power to remove the calluses and my feet were not in anyway like the person on the commercial.  The commercial showed tons on skin being removed, it didn&#x27;t remove anything for me.  Forget it!  I was so disgusted that I threw it away.  So I want back to my manual callus remover file.  Worked but took time sanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently a friend recommended this product. Although I was hesitant, I purchased the rechargeable unit.  All I can say is WONDERFUL!  It lives up to it&#x27;s expectations.  When you first receive it, you will need to charge the batteries.  My feet are baby soft now.  When they start feeling rough a few minutes using the Micro-Pedi Pro and they are baby soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge holds for a long time.  I used it over the past month and decided to recharge it, although it really didn&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and have been burnt before on lower end products that don&#x27;t work as stated, give this a try.  You will be completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product, I used it about twice per month and it really makes my foot nice and smooth. I love this product and it never need batteries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I did extensive research and read many reviews, but I think that I hit the jackpot with this Emjoi Micro-pedi. My feet are now smoothed and cleaned in very little time. Remember that a healthy feet is a sign of good health.</li>
    <li> The problem with emjoi micro-pedi pro rechargeable callus remover is that after 16 hours of charging it, the red light stays red.  It should turn green to indicate the the emjoi is already recharge.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this item. It works best before showering on dry skin. Makes your heels soft and smooth. Highly recommended seller.</li>
    <li> This product makes foot care maintenance a lot easier.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!! I have small painful corns the size of rice from being on my feet to much and working out. The Emjoi took them off my feet feel great. So worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! After 22 years in the Army, my feet had developed some pretty serious calluses. I wanted to have softer feet and lose the cracks for flip-flop weather on our vacation, so I gave this a try. I fully charged this little guy and used it over a towel while watching TV. With no effort, and 20 minutes later I literally had feet softer than I&#x27;ve had probably since I was 10 years old. I mean &amp;#34;BABY&amp;#34; soft feet. No more cracks, at all. The device was still working good when I finished the first pedicure. I followed up again the next night just a little bit, and my spouse could not believe how soft my feet were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives I found is the on/off sliding button is a little tricky, meaning sliding it all the way up into the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position didn&#x27;t work. Sliding it gently up to about the 98% up/on position worked fine. That could just be my unit and not all. The other issue that is really a non-issue is that the recharge light stays on when plugged in whether it&#x27;s charging or not, regardless whether I have it plugged in for 10, 24 or 36 hours, so you never really know when it&#x27;s fully charged and can be unplugged. These are minor issues when compared to the amazing results and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Works well but you need to be patience until getting the expected result.</li>
    <li> Really like this product</li>
    <li> One of the best things I ever bought!  Takes care of my heels in no time flat with no injuries.  I also tried it on a jagged pinky nail, and it smoothed it instantly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product; I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I never ordered this item so I do not know if it is good or bad.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, I had many friends telling me to purchase this product because it does the job, but if you have really bad callus, you need a professional and then use this as a maintenance type of deal.</li>
    <li> This thing is great !  Nohhing worked on my calluses like this. So glad I found it before sandal season!!  Use on clean( no lotion), dry feet.  It won&#x27;t work right after a shower like a pumice would.  My boyfriend is in shock!! .  Say hello to smooth feet. I got the o keeffees healthy feet Cream too, together this works amazing!! So happy</li>
    <li> This is truly the best thing since sliced bread.  I&#x27;m able to work on my calluses so that my feet do not hurt in shoes!!!!!!  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd purchase. Gave 2 to friends as Christmas gifts.  Every one in all countries should have one of these</li>
    <li> I bought this product for me but my husband and found that it keeps the calluses on his feet smooth--he uses it 2-3 times weekly.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my daughter but she didn&#x27;t like it.  My sister has one and loves it</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter as a Christmas present after she tried mine at Thanksgiving.  She was thrilled!  But her husband hooted when he asked what it was and she answered &amp;#34;a foot shaver&amp;#34;!  Hey, if you have feet like mine (ours), I call it &amp;#34;a miracle&amp;#34;!  When your feet are so bad you are ashamed to even go for a pedicure, this is the device for you!  My feet have not looked or felt this good in thirty years!  Tips:  1) Don&#x27;t try to do it all at once.  I took it slowly - in total about two weeks, a little bit every evening.  That way you won&#x27;t go too deep.  2) Don&#x27;t press the sanding area onto your foot.  Just let it lay onto the foot and it works better.  Pressing on it slows it down.  3)  Spend the extra money to get the rechargeable unit.  Otherwise you are going to go through a lot of batteries! ---------------- Update: July 2015 I was gazing at my beautiful feet (yes, I do that nowadays sometimes) and thought I&#x27;d update my review.  This little appliance is just fantastic!  If your feet are as bad a mine were, it will take you a few weeks of daily use.  Also, I ordered some of the &amp;#34;very coarse&amp;#34; refills and that helped a lot on the heel area.  Nowadays I use it about every 3-4 days to just lightly go over potential problem areas.  Then I massage in Amlactin body lotion - another new product for me that works extremely well.  Amlactin lotion is pricey but well worth it.  I watch for it to be on sale at CVS pharmacy - Buy one, get one at half price.    This is the first summer in many, many years that I can wear an open back shoe or sandals   DO treat yourself to owning one of these.  And be SURE to get the rechargeable unit, otherwise you will be purchasing a whole lot of batteries.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It really works on my calluses and on my husbands. I love that it is rechargeable also.</li>
