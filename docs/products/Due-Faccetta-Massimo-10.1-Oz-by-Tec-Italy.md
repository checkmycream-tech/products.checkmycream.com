    <li> Amazing product!!! I recommend it if you do your hair everyday. Helps your hair stay healthy after all the heat it put under. &amp; A plus because I received my product really fast.</li>
    <li> Good product for your hair. Leaves it shining and soft. Recommend 100%.</li>
    <li> It is like a miracle for your hair! I use it the days I wash my hair and it gets the job done IMMEDIATLY! Let the hair feeling SUPER soft and smelling incredibly good! I just cant stop touching my hair after using this product. For me, it is the best product Ive use in my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Helps maintain my hair very healthy!</li>
    <li> Detangles.. leaves hair soft .. love it</li>
    <li> Perfect Price and value.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used! After the first use I saw instant results. I just can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Best hair recontructor after color stripping my hair. It has made my hair stronger and silky. My daughters have used it in their natural blonde hair too and they love it. I use it every time after my shower and also before drying it. It is a must!!! Highly recommended. Be sure to shake before every use.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product. It works well on both natural and chemically treated.&lt;br /&gt;A definite must-have !</li>
    <li> I really like this produc, leaves my hair silky smooth and it smells good.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS AFTER SHAMPOOING TO TREAT MY HAIR WHICH IS DRY. IT DOES CONDITION WELL. STILL, AFTER I&#x27;M DONE STYLING, I USE AN SERUM TO ADD SHINE. BUT I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE DAMAGED OR NORMALLY DRY HAIR AS I DO.</li>
    <li> Love the product, really works.</li>
    <li> I needed something for my hair that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  I was using argon oil and it didn&#x27;t quite do the job.  My cousin has beautiful hair and I asked her what she used.  She told me about Due Faccetta Massimo and I bought it right away.  I finally used it this morning and can&#x27;t be happier!  My hair was nice and controlled after I used my curling iron (normally I&#x27;d have wirey hair sticking out all over).  My hair is shiny and soft as silk!  The BEST thing is that it doesn&#x27;t break my bank!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
    <li> Although a bit pricey, this spray on leave-in conditioner is devine beyond words.  The scent alone is probably one of the main reasons I keep purchasing it.  Also, as my hair is extremely baby-fine, I only need a light misting on my ends and the product seems to absorb right into the hair shaft and make my hair feel soft and look luxurious (not to mention smell like heaven)!  I am hooked on this stuff and if they EVER change the scent, I don&#x27;t know if I would keep buying it any longer.  Definitely a must try.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Leaves my hair soft and it looks healthier</li>
    <li> Great product! Noticed a big difference after just 1 week. My hair went from dry and damaged to soft and healthier.</li>
    <li> Best hair treatment i have uses, been using it for years.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist gifted me her last bottle and I am so happy with the results.  I will continue using this product for my treated and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> It really works!!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my hair! This is a detangler, leave in conditioner, strengthener, and styler all in one. Most of the time this is the only product I use after I wash my hair. Works great and I really see my hair is stronger since I have started this over two years ago.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended me this for my over processed hair. I have seen some improvement in the texture of my hair but not extremely. But it is also my fault for ruining my hair. It has helped.</li>
    <li> best product ever to help untangle stubborn hair....</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is great for naturally curly/wavy hair and it has a pleasant smell to it. We have used this product for over 3 months and we can see the difference. It makes curly hair easier to brush and gives it shine.</li>
    <li> I normally do not buy anything online, therefore I was a bit hesitant about buying this personal product since it was less expensive than anywhere else online. I was very satisfied with the product and it was exactly was I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, great price too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Love it</li>
    <li> My salon uses this ony hair, so I saw immediate results. This strengthens my hair and it detangles it especially when your have dyed hair etc. and having lost hair after having two children it works wonders. Can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 years, have tried  others in between and I always end up going back to due Faccetta. I have never written a review before but this product is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments on how beautiful my hair is.  I flat iron and dye my hair frequently and it&#x27;s always healthy.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair .... It had a great fragrance and eliminates frizzy hair .... Leave in conditioner.  I love it and will definitely purchase again.</li>
