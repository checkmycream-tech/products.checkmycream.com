      <li>I&#x27;m very happy and will definitely repurchase!</li>
      <li>Completely fragrance free and a very good conditioner.</li>
      <li>Great for chemical sensitive individuals.</li>
      <li>I bought this Magick Botanicals conditioner, because it was on the safe list for me, fragrance free, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Magick Botanicals Oil Free Shampoo is recommended on some HCG sites and when I found it on Amazon, along with Magic Botanicals Conditioner, I placed an order.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am allergic to a lot of stuff and can&#x27;t handle strong smells either.  </li>
      <li>I add essential oils for fragrance but great if you need fragrance free products.</li>
      <li>My hair is so shiny and smooth now.  </li>
      <li>Free shipping took over two weeks to get.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also nice that, to me anyway, they don&#x27;t seem to have much of an odor at all.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s oil free.</li>
      <li>it is VMV Hypoallergenics Essence Skin-Saving Superwash Hair and Body, which produces a great lather and requires a tiny amount of product to get it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair detangled and smooth, has no odor...</li>
      <li>I use this along with the magick oil free shampoo</li>
      <li>I think are good for sensitive people with allergies to purfume.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair soft and easy to comb, although I do get static hair more often.</li>
      <li>Reasonably economical and easy to use.</li>
      <li>We use only fragrance free toiletries and this is a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell flowery after I wash it, I just want it to be clean.</li>
      <li>It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They have to be fragrance-free and sometimes even that isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
      <li>I love Magick Botanicals whole line of hair care products.</li>
      <li>As I was preparing to start the low calorie phase of the HCG diet, I put away all my oily shampoos and conditioners and searched for a good replacement.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, highlighted and below my shoulders and the conditioner softens well and is not difficult to rinse.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels great and little or no friz.</li>
      <li>the plus side, it really is fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to a different fragrance free / oil free conditioner that is available at a local store (it&#x27;s cheaper and just as effective).</li>
      <li>I can actually run a comb thru my hair after using it as it detangles nicely.</li>
      <li>is like straw some days (I do not color or perm my hair and rarely blow dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought it because I have problems with breaking out around my hairline, and this doesn&#x27;t break me out but the state of my hair isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>Of those I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It provides slip and just the right moisture balance for me.</li>
      <li>There are not many good fragrance free conditioners.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft &amp; easy to comb.</li>
      <li>The first couple of days I used it</li>
      <li>I have tried many and this is the only one that i like.</li>
      <li>I had hoped I had finally found a good conditioner that did not contain ingredients I&#x27;m allergic to, but it&#x27;s back to the drawing board for me.</li>
      <li>I have fine short hair</li>
      <li>It works great, you only need a little bit, about a nickle....</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair easy to brush out after my shower, and it seems to prevent frizzy flyaways better than other similar products.  </li>
      <li>or they change the product too much</li>
      <li>I bought an organic conditioner from Whole Foods and wasn&#x27;t fond of it.  </li>
      <li>It is really slippery and does not leave build-up after rinsing.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, this conditioner really does have no scent at all.</li>
      <li>so I really need a conditioner or my hair</li>
      <li>Maybe it will work well for people who need only light conditioning.</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice consistency - not too thick - so you can squeeze out just the right amount for your hair.  </li>
      <li>So, after my love affair with other scented products, my scalp has begun to turn on me once again.</li>
      <li>This conditioner along with Clean and Clear face wash for sensitive skin (as shampoo) and a weekly clarify with Ouidad clarifying shampoo, my hair is bouncy, shiny and soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re stuck buying through Amazon, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair, and this leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>The particles did not seem to break apart easily when I tried to break them down in my hands.  </li>
      <li>IS NOT PERFUMMY AS OTHER FRAGRANCE FREE PRODUCTS ARE.</li>
      <li>I decided to try something new and came across Magick Botanicals Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>have contact dermatitis, and I&#x27;m very sensitive.</li>
      <li>Skin is very sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t bother it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly which product helped, but since this product was in the recipe, I&#x27;m giving it a solid 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I have had to try many other shampoo and conditioners recently</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am truly sold on this conditioner!  I used to use Biolage Conditioning Balm by Matrix, but my hair just seemed to still be too dry.  I used that because the smell wasn&#x27;t too overwhelming for me.  I&#x27;d been using it for years.  I decided to try something new and came across Magick Botanicals Conditioner.  The first couple of days I used it, I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.  The longer I used it though, the softer and silkier my hair became.  My hair is so shiny and smooth now.  I love that it is fragrance free too!  I am allergic to a lot of stuff and can&#x27;t handle strong smells either.  This stuff is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a list of products I&#x27;m allowed to use and this was the only company that did not test on animals so I opted to try it.  I have very long curly hair and this works well for me and I&#x27;ve had no allergic reactions to it.</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner for almost a month. I had to stop using it because my hair was so weighted down and flat due to conditioner build-up. I tried using different amounts, Applying it to different parts of my hair, leaving it in longer, rinsing it out earlier, but nothing worked. As a sdie note, I do live where there is very hard water, so this may have effected the effectiveness.    On the plus side, this conditioner really does have no scent at all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t improve dry ends or reduce frizz.  When hair is wet, it does detangle and *feels* like it&#x27;s smoothing and conditioning, but after I blow dry my hair (on low heat), my ends still look dry and the rest of my hair is little frizzy.  I have color treated hair so maybe mine needs a stronger type of conditioner than this one. Maybe this product&#x27;s \\&quot;oil free\\&quot; formula is why it doesn&#x27;t improve my hair.  Maybe it will work well for people who need only light conditioning. I couldn&#x27;t detect a fragrance in this one, which I like.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the magick oil free shampoo and I really love it.  It conditions and detangles without adding build up to make your hair feel heavy or greasy.  A little bit goes a long way and I generally find that one bottle will last through 2 bottles of shampoo.  And I have shoulder length hair.  I generally only put it on the ends, not on my scalp, although I have used it all over and don&#x27;t find any problems.</li>
    <li> I have MCS and can&#x27;t use almost all shampoo&#x27;s or conditioners even if it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance.  I don&#x27;t have any reactions when I use Magick Conditioner.  I hope that they will make this product forever.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how nice this works without oil.  Keeps my hair soft and easy to comb, although I do get static hair more often.</li>
    <li> good if you have hypersensitivity to perfumes and fragrances.  Cleans and conditions well, but needs a few washings to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My daughter is allergic to perfumes. This works great and is fragrance free.  I even use it myself!</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair very silky, and is the only non-scented conditioner I&#x27;ve found that works so well.  I&#x27;ve been buying this product for several years now.</li>
    <li> This is the worst conditioner I have ever used in my life. I bought it because I have problems with breaking out around my hairline, and this doesn&#x27;t break me out but the state of my hair isn&#x27;t worth it. First of all, this conditioner is extremely watery, and for all it does you might as well just use water instead. All it is good for is helping brush your hair in the shower but once it washes out it has no conditioning qualities. Left my hair feeling like straw.</li>
    <li> We have been using the Magick Botanicals Shampoo as well as their Conditioner for years and yes, the shampoo is a little watery, but it is truly the only one we have found that is really fragrance free. Members of my family have sensitivity to anything with a scent and these are the only products that we have found that work for all of us.  The shampoo and the conditioner are even ok with color treated hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Completely fragrance free and a very good conditioner. Reasonably economical and easy to use. I have used this product a long time and plan to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> When I found I had contact dermatitis allergies, my dermatologist gave me a list of &#x27;safe&#x27; products to use on my hair - this was one of those conditioners.  Of those I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far my favorite.  It is a nice consistency - not too thick - so you can squeeze out just the right amount for your hair.  I have long, fine hair, and this leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky.  It leaves my hair easy to brush out after my shower, and it seems to prevent frizzy flyaways better than other similar products.  So glad to find a product that works and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my allergies!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product that exceeded my expectations and was delivered on time. It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> leaves hair, shiny with no residue. I add essential oils for fragrance but great if you need fragrance free products.</li>
    <li> Good product. No problems with delivery. Wrapped well.</li>
    <li> Great for chemical sensitive individuals. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Free shipping took over two weeks to get.</li>
    <li> Gets the tangles out of your hair.  Haven&#x27;t found one to compare to this yet.  Excellent fragrance free hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells nice but it I feel as if it leaves a film on my hair</li>
    <li> I must&#x27;ve gotten a bad abatch of this product because, not only does it not really condition my hair - doesn&#x27;t feel soft to the touch, etc. - it seems to have problems with the formulation.  The product is gritty and contained particles in it the size of rice granules, sometimes a little larger than rice, of something - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product clumped up or what.  The particles did not seem to break apart easily when I tried to break them down in my hands.  I had hoped I had finally found a good conditioner that did not contain ingredients I&#x27;m allergic to, but it&#x27;s back to the drawing board for me. All in all, extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Dr tangles my long hair we&#x27;ll, and I have no reaction to it! Just wish it had more beneficial ingredients</li>
    <li> Love Magick botanical conditioner. I have fine short hair so a nickel size squirt goes a long way. It makes my hair soft &amp; easy to comb.</li>
    <li> Good produce! Makes hair feel silky.</li>
    <li> I buy this for family and friends to use when they visit. We use only fragrance free toiletries and this is a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Skin is very sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t bother it.</li>
    <li> I was using this because I was on the HcG diet and had to eliminate oil products from my beauty regimen while on the diet. The conditioner was okay. It helped, but I didn&#x27;t like it as much as my regular conditioners.</li>
    <li> So, after my love affair with other scented products, my scalp has begun to turn on me once again. Enter Magick Botanicals conditioner. It is really slippery and does not leave build-up after rinsing. I have tightly curled afro hair and I like this product. It provides slip and just the right moisture balance for me.</li>
    <li> Great for a no oil product.</li>
    <li> This conditioner surprised me I must say... I usually use WEN but needed an oil free option due to a diet I&#x27;m on.  I bought an organic conditioner from Whole Foods and wasn&#x27;t fond of it.  I decided to try this due to the reviews and I&#x27;m happy I did.  I am not sure what ingredient in this formula is responsible for the softness of my hair but I&#x27;m surprised by how well my hair reacts... My hair is fine, highlighted and below my shoulders and the conditioner softens well and is not difficult to rinse.  I do spend a minute longer on the rinse just because how soft it feels... like I need to keep rinsing.  Overall, I will repurchase as needed but it won&#x27;t replace WEN.</li>
    <li> After skin patch tests, this is one of very few conditioners that I am not allergic to.  I&#x27;m not sure if it will eliminate my itchy scalp but I know it will not add to the problem.</li>
    <li> Like this conditioner for my curly hair.  It foams a bit, but de-tangles without weighing down the curls.</li>
    <li> I recently found out that I am allergic to propylene glycol, and this conditioner was on the short list of products that I could use.  I love it!  It&#x27;s emollient without being too heavy.  I have very thick hair and live in a very humid climate so it might be too much for fine hair in similar humdity?  I am not a fan of the shampoo, however.  It requires a ton of product to achieve a barely satisfactory lather.  Expensive but worth it is VMV Hypoallergenics Essence Skin-Saving Superwash Hair and Body, which produces a great lather and requires a tiny amount of product to get it.</li>
    <li> I had called and asked some questions in regards to a few ingredients I was wondering about for my daughter, she is severely sensitive to everything, but I couldn&#x27;t get any straight answers from the lady, and she was SO VERY RUDE!!! She actually told me, \\&quot;I hear your baby crying in the back ground, she&#x27;s saying mommy get off the phone, the lady doesn&#x27;t want to talk to you anymore\\&quot;. Excuse me!?? All her products we&#x27;ve tried are irritating to even me, and I have no sensitivities! Don&#x27;t buy anything from this lady!</li>
    <li> more like a creme rinse but, still a good, healthy product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to all sorts of plant-based ingredients, essential oils, and perfumes. This brand of hair products has a short list of ingredients and doesn&#x27;t give me rashes, nosebleeds, etc., which I get from other brands.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s odd that there are little chunks in this.  Did I get a bottle of product that is so old it has started to crystallized?  I don&#x27;t think I want to buy another bottle to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it really is fragrance free.  I bought it because I&#x27;m chemical sensitive.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has performed well, leaving no odor... something I actually had to get used to.  I started to suspect my scalp was reacting negatively to fragrances in shampoos and conditioners as I had developed some minor psoriasis (and major dandruff).  I used this in combination with DHS Zinc shampoo and MG217 Psoriasis Medicated Conditioning Coal Tar Formula Shampoo, rotating with some DHS clear shampoo, and the problem has completely vanished.  I don&#x27;t know exactly which product helped, but since this product was in the recipe, I&#x27;m giving it a solid 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I started using Magick Botanicals Shampoo and Conditioner in 2006. I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell flowery after I wash it, I just want it to be clean. I&#x27;ve since switched to a different fragrance free / oil free conditioner that is available at a local store (it&#x27;s cheaper and just as effective). But if you&#x27;re stuck buying through Amazon, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT IS NOT PERFUMMY AS OTHER FRAGRANCE FREE PRODUCTS ARE. I will  order it again. The shampoo is also good, I use both and it last a long time , a lot of washings</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair detangled and smooth, has no odor... but it&#x27;s oil free. good for hcg diet</li>
    <li> I look for perfume-free products wherever I can and used this product for a long time, but I found &amp;#34;earth science&amp;#34; brand at Festival Foods near my house for less.</li>
    <li> There are not many good fragrance free conditioners.  This is the best fragrance free conditioner.  I would recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner! It leaves my hair so silky and so smooth!! I have had to try many other shampoo and conditioners recently and this conditioner is by far the best!</li>
    <li> Having been recently diagnosed with contact dermatitis allergic due to preservatives, I tried each of the whopping 4 &amp;#34;approved&amp;#34; allergy free conditioners on my list. Magick Botanicals was the last I tried but it was the winner hands down. Excellent consistency. Makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t weight it down. I can actually run a comb thru my hair after using it as it detangles nicely. Other conditioners didn&#x27;t compare. I&#x27;m very happy and will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is fragrance free as described, but caused terrible itching of my scalp.  I could not use it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for years.  In addition to being one of the few fragrance-free ones on the market, it helps keep my long hair soft and silky.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it, and find that it works well with many shampoos.</li>
    <li> i hate regular conditioners -- HATE. The reason? I break out on my face and neck from regular conditioners and used to have to be extremely vigilant about not getting any on my skin. I&#x27;d rinse and rinse making sure not to let anything, not even the rinse water, touch my face. Talk about stressful showers!! Double that with now having well water (even though I have a shower filter) and STILL having flat, crunchy, weird-feeling hair due to hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started searching for oil-free conditioner and found this! Please, please don&#x27;t stop making this stuff. This conditioner along with Clean and Clear face wash for sensitive skin (as shampoo) and a weekly clarify with Ouidad clarifying shampoo, my hair is bouncy, shiny and soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this conditioner AND my showers are relaxing since I no longer worry about oils, fragrance and who knows what else, causing acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love Magick Botanicals whole line of hair care products. I have an awful time finding hair care products that don&#x27;t aggravate me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have to be fragrance-free and sometimes even that isn&#x27;t good enough. There are several different shampoos out there that I can use but before this I&#x27;ve never found a conditioner I could tolerate for very long, even when it&#x27;s fragrance-free (they make me itch and break out). And I have dry hair so I really need a conditioner or my hair is like straw some days (I do not color or perm my hair and rarely blow dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for several years with no problems and the gel and detangling/shine spray for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice that, to me anyway, they don&#x27;t seem to have much of an odor at all. Sometimes fragrance-free products still have some sort of a lingering odor to them that bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope they stick around for a long time. It seems like every time I find a product I can use the company either goes out of business or they change the product too much and I can&#x27;t use it any longer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people that have problems with smells.  This is the only conditioner and shampoo and gel I think are good for sensitive people with allergies to purfume.  I have tried many and this is the only one that i like.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I started using it after I discovered I had a ton of skin allergies. It&#x27;s great and light weight and I&#x27;m not allergic!</li>
    <li> great for people with allergies!</li>
    <li> As I was preparing to start the low calorie phase of the HCG diet, I put away all my oily shampoos and conditioners and searched for a good replacement. Magick Botanicals Oil Free Shampoo is recommended on some HCG sites and when I found it on Amazon, along with Magic Botanicals Conditioner, I placed an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that my hair wouldn&#x27;t be soft enough or the friz tamed enough without an oil-based conditioner but I was proved wrong. My hair feels great and little or no friz. I&#x27;ve added this conditioner to my after-HCG regimen.</li>
    <li> I bought this Magick Botanicals conditioner, because it was on the safe list for me, fragrance free, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I have contact dermatitis, and I&#x27;m very sensitive. It works great, you only need a little bit, about a nickle....does the job, pull it through your hair and leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
