<li> It&#x27;s hard enough to keep my bun updo for work 10 hours a day and through a gym workout but also flexible enough that when I take my hair down, I can brush right through it and have the volume I need.</li>

<li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find--most salons don&#x27;t sell it.  </li>
<li> it is sooooo much less expensive.</li>
<li> I hated hair sprays before this, but this holds my hair yet keeps it flexible and looking like it is held in place naturally, not frozen in place with glue.</li>
<li> It is expensive but it does the job.</li>
<li> Every time I try something else I am always disappointed.  </li>
<li> I hate feeling product in my hair.  </li>

    <li> This is by far my most favorite hairspray! It&#x27;s hard enough to keep my bun updo for work 10 hours a day and through a gym workout but also flexible enough that when I take my hair down, I can brush right through it and have the volume I need. It&#x27;s not sticky and smells good!</li>
    <li> Very little control.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Got to me when they said.</li>
    <li> Have used this productoften and it really gives a soft hold.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Love it!  Love the product and love the size of the product that is available for the cost.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years and love it. I hated hair sprays before this, but this holds my hair yet keeps it flexible and looking like it is held in place naturally, not frozen in place with glue. It is easy to comb through and helps keep frizz at bay. Just to let you know, I have baby fine, naturally curly hair and it works great whether I let my curls curl or dry my hair straight.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation from my sister, and after I started using it my daughter started coming in to &#x27;borrow&#x27; it, too.  Nice hold without being dry and crispy in your hair,</li>
    <li> I have used this for 6 years and think it is the best spray on the market. Hair feels great!</li>
    <li> Not as good as my Kenra. It does not seem to hold as well.  I will finish this can but will go back to Kenra 26!</li>
    <li> I have used this hairspray for years.  Every time I try something else I am always disappointed.  This provides the best hold but with a natural feel--no sticky hairspray feeling! I hate feeling product in my hair.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find--most salons don&#x27;t sell it.  The price can vary so I have to shop around online.  Great price through Amazon this time--it&#x27;s usually more expensive here.</li>
    <li> Holds your style&#x27;s shape but brushes out easily. Have been using this for years and years. I think you will like it, too.</li>
    <li> I think I have found my new holy grail hairspray!  I have been in hairspray limbo ever since Ojon Tunu flexible spray was discontinued.  Years later I try this.  LOVE IT.  It holds, but isn&#x27;t crunchy.  Definitely brushable.  I use this mainly on my bangs or for a little volume/curl.  It holds all day for me.  The scent is not what I expected though.  It smells a bit like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> Great product, soft scent. Soft hold. Not harsh on chemically treated hair. Other products I have used in the past have altered the (chemical) color and/or texture prematurely-so far, this product has not.</li>
    <li> I spray a little after on damp hair after showering then comb out in a few minutes. Woks for me. Doesn&#x27;t stink like most cheapo hairsprays.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. Been using it for several years now. Never sticky or heavy feel on my hair.  Very quick shipment!  All arrived well.</li>
    <li> Flexible, light, almost invisible but yet holding your hair strongly. Great quality from OSIS - never expected any less. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray. It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down. This is the FLEXIBLE hold. I use their FREEZE spray for more of a hold on top knots, etc.</li>
    <li> good scent, good fixation! a little goes a long way, it&#x27;ll take for ever to use it all. i recomend it.</li>
    <li> love this spray. No residue. No stickiness. And I love that it&#x27;s still flexible and playable.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair spray and it brushes out easily.  I am really enjoying the product and will order more.</li>
    <li> Osis Flex Hold Hairspray is my personal favorite hairspray because it holds very well - and it is what it says, &amp;#34;flexible.&amp;#34;  If you decide to change part of what you have already sprayed, just let it dry and comb through and spray again.  Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> The spray is light and holds well without being too sticky. I dont really like the smell though. Its very strong and smells like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> This was exactly the same item I was buying at a beauty shop. However the price was much lower. All items were &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is no better than other hair sprays you can buy at drug stores.</li>
    <li> Product is great. But it didn&#x27;t arrive for over 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This hairspray keeps style in place but not too stiff and never becomes flaky - my 1st choice every time!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product and I made my initial purchase from the salon for substantially more than the cost through Amazon. Before using this hair spray the spray I was using left a residue on may hair that wasn&#x27;t removed by daily washings. My hair stylist now reports no residue on my hair.</li>
    <li> It the most magnificent , awsome hairspray I have ever tried and bought. It&#x27;s magic.  My hair is thick, hard to manage and this Osis keeps the shape, remembers the shape and is truly great, great, great.........&lt;br /&gt;I would and do recommend this product to everyone.  Men &amp; women,.  I have actually ordered recently for 2 women who noticed my hair and asked what  I use.  ..........  I have this wonderful product for the last 5 years.............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot, when I wake up in the morning and hair as you know is a mess, all I have to do is put ny hands through my hair or better yet, take a brush, comb and it will remember your style.............  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.........</li>
    <li> I really like this hair spray. It holds hair in place but still allows some movement so hair looks natural.</li>
    <li> Not sticky and very little build up but hold well.  I really like this one! I use it as a final mist, still use sebastian to style.</li>
    <li> This hair spray actually holds the hair in place. The nice thing is the hair is not like a football helmet.  Love it!</li>
    <li> As the good friend of a stylist who passes on a ton of free products, I know my hair products. This is my all-time favorite spray. I&#x27;ve used it for about 7 years now and no other sprays come close. Just enough hold without being sticky or crunchy. This is NOT for those times when you need to shellac your hair in place. But I don&#x27;t ever do that, anyway, so this is perfect. I also love the fresh, unisex scent. I don&#x27;t like the overly sweet smell of other sprays. The price on here is way less than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have used it for years now.  So glad I can get it on Amazon instead of only in salon b. it is sooooo much less expensive.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this product because it holds the style and gives volume and movement. I love it!  Its worth the price.</li>
    <li> The delivery was super fast. Price incredible for how massive the can is. Perfect hold not too light not too heavy just right.</li>
    <li> Never sticky or flaky.</li>
    <li> Holds firm in all weather. I don&#x27;t have to worry about humidity using these products.  It is expensive but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I thought this was supposed to leave the hair flexible.  Not for our type of hair, folks.  It made my hair stiff just like Aqua Net used to do! Wasted my money.</li>
