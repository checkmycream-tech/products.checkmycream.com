      <li>These are good quality socks that feel comfortable and absorb perspiration better than the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s diabetic socks I usually wear.  </li>
      <li>Super swollen feet and legs..</li>
      <li>Still better than normal socks.</li>
      <li>The fabric is soft and the socks are easy, yes easy, to put on the swollen foot.</li>
      <li>I am 5&#x27;11 inches and these socks come to just below the knee, so they are good for the winter months though likely too hot for the summer.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not too tight but yet stay up great.</li>
      <li>I looked everywhere  for socks that would fit my brother who is quite large and is diabetic.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve washed and dried great.</li>
      <li>Certainly worth the price.</li>
      <li>Oh my, these are the most comfortable socks ever for a diabetic man with MS and a Big Foot!</li>

      <li>They stay up pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I have huge legs and never thought there was a sock made that actually fit, and was even kinda loose!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fall down, but are nice and floppy and comfy.  </li>
      <li>The service was ok but the socks stretched too much.</li>
      <li>My husband has large ankles and has worn ankle socks all year because of this</li>
      <li>About 1 year, and the top just gives loose, and you need to throw them away.</li>
      <li>They worked very well, and are very durable.</li>
      <li>I purchased these for my husband and he really likes them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them</li>
      <li>His normal shoe size is 8 1/2.</li>
      <li>A dream come true with a minor flaw.</li>
      <li>This is the first time we have ordered these socks trying to alleviate the binding effect of the current socks.</li>
      <li>Bought these for my son in law who has extra large calves and they did the trick.  </li>
      <li>How nice to have socks that don&#x27;t shrink so much they are difficult to put on.  </li>
      <li>With they were a little lower in price,  but it is worth it!</li>
      <li>anyway these are my first socks that are made big enough.</li>
      <li>He has had a had time in the past finding socks that would fit.  </li>
      <li>They are very soft, and there is just enough &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; elastic so it does not squeeze any area of coverage.</li>
      <li>I do have rather broad feet.</li>
      <li>These Extra Wide socks, although a little pricey are really the only socks that fit me</li>
      <li>The socks were wide enough to comfortably put on over a sore foot, but the tops were too wide to stay up when worn.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re plenty big for my size 14 foot, and have held up well so far.</li>
      <li>OMG they actually are extra wide and extra large!</li>
      <li>These would come up a little higher than do the Quarter socks (which I also ordered) -- but wouldn&#x27;t have to be pulled up over the entire calf.</li>

<li> The one thing I question is the stitching across the toes which seems a little thick</li>
<li> They are well made and tough.</li>
<li> I followed the washing directions, the poor things just didn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
<li> It has been very cold here</li>

    <li> I have been looking for these socks for years - ever since Jockey changer their line.  They don&#x27;t fall down, but are nice and floppy and comfy.  Fit in shoes just fine.  If you walk around the house in your socks, buy these.</li>
    <li> Real good socks, just wish the tops kept their shape longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; 340 lbs. 65 yo. Super swollen feet and legs..these work great for me, very nice, no compromises here.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere  for socks that would fit my brother who is quite large and is diabetic. Thank goodness, I finally found them and at a great price!!</li>
    <li> if you have wide calves and wide feet these are great.</li>
    <li> My husband got cellulitis in his right calf. These socks have been great!  They&#x27;re not too tight but yet stay up great. They&#x27;ve washed and dried great. Going to purchase more. Certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> The socks were wide enough to comfortably put on over a sore foot, but the tops were too wide to stay up when worn.  Still better than normal socks.</li>
    <li> My husband has very large calves. He loves these socks!</li>
    <li> The service was ok but the socks stretched too much. It became all one size and lost the shape if the heel.</li>
    <li> Oh my, these are the most comfortable socks ever for a diabetic man with MS and a Big Foot! A dream come true with a minor flaw. About 1 year, and the top just gives loose, and you need to throw them away. I followed the washing directions, the poor things just didn&#x27;t hold up. I&#x27;ve thrown out about 4 pairs, and they are a bit pricey for the length of durability.</li>
    <li> The tops of these socks got stretched out of shape in just a few weeks, because of my big calf muscles.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for &amp;#34;over-the-calf&amp;#34; socks -- I really wanted good, old-fashioned, crew socks.  These would come up a little higher than do the Quarter socks (which I also ordered) -- but wouldn&#x27;t have to be pulled up over the entire calf.</li>
    <li> These are very wide.  I am 5&#x27;4 and big and was able to pull these up passed my knee.  They stay up pretty well.  They are soft and strong.  No support of any kind.  But I love them</li>
    <li> More like knee highs than crew socks</li>
    <li> My husband has large ankles and has worn ankle socks all year because of this and I decided to see if I could find ones that&lt;br /&gt;were extra wide and these are perfect. It has been very cold here and they work great!</li>
    <li> This is the first time we have ordered these socks trying to alleviate the binding effect of the current socks. My husband says they fit well, but are too expensive. We will continue to look for similar socks for a less expensive price.</li>
    <li> These Extra Wide socks, although a little pricey are really the only socks that fit me well... They are well made and tough. I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Great socks that don&#x27;t cut off circulation in my husband&#x27;s legs!</li>
    <li> Finally socks that are Big enough. Good Quality and plenty wide. I have very wide calves and that actually fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my husband and he really likes them. His leg swells and these do not bind him. They are very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Husband Loves them.  With they were a little lower in price,  but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband who was suffering from extremely swollen legs/calves due to side effects from cancer treatments. They are very soft, and there is just enough &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; elastic so it does not squeeze any area of coverage. His normal shoe size is 8 1/2. This size was required due to the size of the swelling. They worked very well, and are very durable. Plenty of washing and no issues.</li>
    <li> if you have a wide size 13 men&#x27;s shoes these are the socks for you. big, thick and soft. great for diabetics, there plenty loose yet they are snug enough to stay up. after living 59 years most of that in a size 13 shoe. I went in and got fitted shoes because of diabetes, and find out I need a 14. anyway these are my first socks that are made big enough. will buy again.</li>
    <li> OMG they actually are extra wide and extra large! These socks were purchased for someone who wears a size 13 shoe of medium width but has swelling in one foot. The fabric is soft and the socks are easy, yes easy, to put on the swollen foot. The one thing I question is the stitching across the toes which seems a little thick and I wonder if it could cause irritation when walking, which unfortunately I won&#x27;t be able to rate because the person who wears these socks is currently unable to walk.</li>
    <li> These are indeed extra wide, and extra long too. Very soft and comfortable. I have huge legs and never thought there was a sock made that actually fit, and was even kinda loose! I will be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re plenty big for my size 14 foot, and have held up well so far.</li>
    <li> I am 5&#x27;11 inches and these socks come to just below the knee, so they are good for the winter months though likely too hot for the summer. I do have rather broad feet. Socks not yet washed so I do not know how they will stand up to the washing process: have no reason to believe they will not launder well.</li>
    <li> These are good quality socks that feel comfortable and absorb perspiration better than the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s diabetic socks I usually wear.  However, the socks cut the circulation off to my feet after wearing them through the day.  The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s diabetic socks do not cut off the circulation to my feet.  The socks I received, although marked &amp;#34;fits men&#x27;s shoe sizes 11-16 up to 6E&amp;#34; may be best for people with feet no wider than 3E.</li>
    <li> great fit, wears a bit too quick at heal</li>
    <li> Bought these for my son in law who has extra large calves and they did the trick.  He has had a had time in the past finding socks that would fit.  These were perfect!</li>
    <li> Have to be a giant to use these.</li>
    <li> These sox are just what the DR. ordered for my flat feet they are absolutely great.  However it was a little disconcerting reading the letter that was sent with them:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; One pair of your socks was opened when we were taking photos of the socks.  They have never been worn or tried on by anyone.  I&#x27;m deducting $3.50 from your order since this pair has been opened. &amp;#34; ( and they obviously were )</li>
    <li> How nice to have socks that don&#x27;t shrink so much they are difficult to put on.  My husband loves these Extra Wide Socks.</li>
    <li> very comfortable and roomy for size 12 with large calf, however not all the sock pairs were the same, but still good.</li>
