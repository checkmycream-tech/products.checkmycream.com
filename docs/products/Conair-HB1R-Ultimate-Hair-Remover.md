      <li>&amp;quot;Wow a pain free hair removal system!</li>

      <li>:) it dont worked for us at all.</li>
      <li>It works much better than any electric razor or cream I have ever used.  </li>

      <li>but it seems to get better with use.  </li>
      <li>I have read many reviews that say that this gadget irritated skin and that it didn&#x27;t remove hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 1/2 weeks - Conair&#x27;s recommended adjustment period of 10-12 uses. It has pluses and minuses; and, I&#x27;ve learned a few things since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;If you currently use wax or an epilator (and like the results) you will NOT be happy with this.  It lasts exactly as long as shaving and is about as close.  It is not to be used in the bikini area and I would not stick it under my armpits for anything - so you still have to use a razor.  I also find it hard to use around my ankles and knees.  &lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I can use it when ever, or how often, I want.  It is easier for me to use on the backs of my legs than shaving.  It exfoliates beautifully and it doesn&#x27;t leave any red bumps.  The hair is left tapered so stubble shows a bit less than shaving.  It works much better than any electric razor or cream I have ever used.  I have course dark hair against white skin (prone to ingrown hairs), so hair removal is always a challenge for me.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:  They are not kidding when they say to use it on completly dry skin.  The first few times I tried it, my moisturizer gummed up the pads.  And, even worse, I hit a sweaty spot, the thing stuck, and I got a rug (exfoliater?) burn.  Do not try to sand off every single hair the first few times or you will sand off skin!!!  Just follow up with a razor until you get use to it.  I find that taking a quick pass over everything and then going after the remaining hair a second (or even third) time works much, much better (and I don&#x27;t get burns.)  It really does take a few trys to start getting good results.&lt;br /&gt;The pads are washable!!!  A single pad clogs up and quits working before I finish my first leg.  So, I line them all up and replace them as I need them. When I am all done, I wash them off with an old soft toothbrush and let them air dry - good as new.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this product.  It removed every bit of hair from my legs, and my skin is soft, soft, soft!  I definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did a test... one leg with the orbital sander of a hair remover, and one leg shaved.  After the &amp;quot;sawdust&amp;quot; cleared, and the ringing in my ears stopped, the leg still had stubble and stung.  The remover was a waste of my money... it&#x27;s loud, and you are basically sanding your leg like a piece of wood.  The next day, the shaved leg was still smooth, while the &amp;quot;sanded&amp;quot; leg was still &#x27;stubbly&#x27;.  My advise to you would be to stick to the old tried and true method of shaving or use the money on a good waxing (more painful, but better results).</li>
    <li> Honestly, this was a waste of money. I&#x27;ve used almost every kind of hair removal system out there and all I can say this thing hurts like crazy!!! I&#x27;ve used epilators and I didn&#x27;t even feel as much pain as I did using the Ultimate Hair remover. It left my legs with red bumps for a whole 2 days.  The hair on my leg is very light and thin so I was pretty surprise that I had to go over an area a couple of times. By the time, I was done with my legs I was in pain. I literally couldn&#x27;t move some parts of my leg because it was so sanded down. Like many others I got this product thinking it was going to be God&#x27;s gift to all women nevertheless I am disappointed. This taught me a valuable lesson - we are all individuals and sometimes you just have to test an item out at the store before you purchase something online. I am an Amazonaholic but I have to say this is the most disappointing purchase I ever made here. I don&#x27;t blame anyone for it but the reviews portray this item as the ultimate contraption that will replace razors. Oh, please this was nothing but a sander. It just sands your leg down- doesn&#x27;t remove any hair - well only if you are willing to spend 30 minutes or more on one leg. As for the usefulness of this item there isn&#x27;t really useful other than being a great exfoliator but why spend $50 on an exfoliator while you can get something even better for cheaper??</li>
    <li> If you like your skin, I have to recommend against buying the Conair HB1 Hair Removal System.  I am usually leery of the claims of any hair removal product that say it is painless.  However, I had seen some good reviews in two magazines, so I decided to try it.  What a disappointment!  Conair recommends using it for at least 10 times to see results and I was originally willing to do this.  After the third use, the skin on my legs was very irritated and I decided to stop using it.  I do not have sensitive skin so it was surprising to see the effect this product had.  It also took areas on my legs almost two weeks to get back to normal.  The HB1 comes with four exfoliating pads, but I could tell they would not last for long, so you&#x27;d be putting out more money for the replacement pads.  All in all this was a very disappointing product.  The only good thing about it was that Walgreens (where I purchased it) gave me no trouble about returning it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this hair removal device. However, the first time I tried it, I ended up with burns all over my legs. Amazingly, I wanted it to work so much that I tried it again being more careful. After an hour, I ended up with some hair removal on one lower leg. The third time I also spent a long time and didn&#x27;t get anywhere. I got results on the thicker hair areas, but the fine hair never went away, regardless of length. I could never get anywhere smooth. And forget about the knees or ankle area - ouch!&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, it takes way too long for little results. Shaving only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It does take a little getting used to but it worked for me. I have very corse dark hair. I swear I would have a 5 oclock shadow on my legs and would have to shave almost everyday. I have used this and my hair does not grow as fast. I just wish it would work for bikini area and face.       The pads don&#x27;t last as long as I would like them to but I guess the cost of replacement pads is the same as replacing razor blades.       I did get a sunburn feeling the 1st couple times, but that goes away fast. My boyfriend likes to do the back of my legs for me so it is even easier. I am pretty tall and have very long legs. lol      I love how soft and smooth my legs feel after using this product. I get rid of hair and dead skin all in one shot. :)</li>
    <li> I just received this product in the mail today and tried it as soon as I got home.  It was amazing.  I didn&#x27;t experience any redness, stinging or bumps after using this.  I never felt it at all and it actually buffed away the hair along with the dead skin.  My legs are so smooth and soft now.  I am so happy that I bought this.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really mind waxing or epilation but I thought this would be easier and a lot less painful.  Yes, it is not painful but it did irritate my skin.  It does not remove hair it sands it off same as a power sander would do to a rough edge of wood.  The results are worse than shaving.  I never have gotten everything off.  Under arms?  Don&#x27;t even think about it.  They&#x27;ll be irritated for a couple of days.  Do yourself a favor and buy and epilator.  Spend a little more money and get MUCH better results!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.  I would have given it 0 stars if that was an option.</li>
    <li> I have previously used this product.  My sister owns one and I tried it while visiting her in Florida.    I have been looking  all over for this great product.  The Albany NY Bed, Bath and Beyond does not have the product in stock.  I am so happy to find it on Amazon and I am definetly going to buy it.  I hate shaving with a razor.  I always end up cutting myself around the knee and ankle area.  The first time you use it is time consuming because there is a special technique you need to use but once you have that down it is a breeze and the hair does not regrow as fast as shaving and there are no ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months.  I have coarse hair and sensitive skin, and shaving with a regular razor can lead to red bumps and ingrown hairs.  I often resort to an electric shaver to spare my poor skin, but even though I use a really effective electric shaver, it just doesn&#x27;t get as close as a real razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found a formula that works really well!  If one tries to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; hairs that are more than a few days long with the epilator, you will end up with red, irritated skin and lots of hairs left untouched.  SOLUTION:  Begin with a thorough shave with your electric razor, then follow with the epilator.  You won&#x27;t need to go over and over your skin with the epilator if you use this method.  You&#x27;ll be left with velvety-soft skin that is not irritated or \\&quot;burned\\&quot;.  Maybe this seems like a lot of work, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s actually pretty quick to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little practice to get used to the epilator; don&#x27;t press it onto your skin, let it float over as you move it in a circular motion.  Start slowly, perhaps practicing on one part of your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone with similar irritation issues.  My legs are in better condition than ever, smooth and bump-free.  Those who have had a bad experience with the epilator might want to try again with my described method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not battery operated, so you must work near an outlet.  The replacement pads aren&#x27;t exactly cheap, but they do last quite awhile.  Doesn&#x27;t work as well on bony areas or bikini zone.</li>
    <li> Beware! This thing, even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure, as well as not keep it in one spot, it took the top layer of skin off! My poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work. Ow! I had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed. And what&#x27;s worse, it didn&#x27;t take out all the hair.... I could still see some hair here and there it missed, and I thought I got it all. I returned it immediately and got a refund on my money. Never again.... I&#x27;ll stick to my good ol&#x27; electric razor instead.....</li>
    <li> This product is great at exfoliating, not so great at hair removal.  Your skin will be silky smooth, but still have hair.  The hair that is removed doesn&#x27;t stay gone long.  And it&#x27;s tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body.  It will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product.</li>
    <li> I got this about 2 or 3 years ago. The main reason I decided to get it was to use after I used the nono. The replacement buffers for the nono are costly and they ware out quick.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I got a bad skin burn.&lt;br /&gt;For someone who had very sensitive skin, it hurt burned For a few days. To sum it up it does remove hair but I would rather use a laser.&lt;br /&gt;I put it away after about 3 uses and do not use it&lt;br /&gt;For hair removal any longer.&lt;br /&gt;But it does still get a lot of use. It work fantastic for callus on the feet. My feet used to be rough dry and cracked, but now there smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love it as a foot exfoliator. To me it&#x27;s too bulky for almost all over hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my review helps someone to decide&lt;br /&gt;If this product is usable for them.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the results of this product!  Conair has done it -- ladies, get rid of your razors and waxes!!  No cuts, and this product really does exfoliate.  I love it.</li>
    <li> OMG! If you haven&#x27;t tried this hair remover yet, go get one NOW! It is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever seen. It does one heck of a job with no pain. Best of all it exfoliates like crazy. I walk around bare-footed all the time, so I have some nasty dry skin on my heels. This sucker wipes it away in no time. It&#x27;s amazing. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> This thing didn&#x27;t work AT ALL.  I tried it, my mom tried it and my friend tried it.  Nada.  Nuthin&#x27;.  It&#x27;ll shine your legs up but it didn&#x27;t pull up any hair.  &lt;br /&gt;Save your pennies and stick with your Bic, kids.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping I could use it on my head....which in and of itself may seem stupid to y&#x27;all.....but, it said it painlessly removed hair of any length. The person who said it was an orbital sander had it right, and it mostly sanded the skin, not the hair. I ended up looking like Gorbachev with mange.....big red blotches, chunks of hair, had to use a razor to get it back into shape, used aloe to calm the burning which made it worse.....So I returned it, I would by only if you want to open a low level torture botique...</li>
    <li> This is the easiest hair removal system i have ever used and will continue using it . great great great</li>
    <li> The result I got from this is not even remotely close to what seems to be promised by the manufacturers. &lt;BR&gt; It does not remove hair.. it just rubs skin with rough surface of the disk so that the hair gets cut at the root. And this cutting off process is not close to the skin surface so I feel bumps of hair all the time. &lt;BR&gt; As suggested in the instructions, I tried to go over the same area for a second round, and it damaged my skin so bad.. I still have the scar of that damage after 2 months. It basically scrapped a thin layer off of my skin in that area and two days later, my skin made a hard red layer in that place to heal the damage.&lt;BR&gt;  This is the case with the larger areas like thighs.. This product does not come for any use over the knees or any area  smaller than the diameter of the disk.&lt;BR&gt;  And finally.. usage of this product does not have any impact on regrowth of the hair at all.</li>
    <li> I have been reading the reviews and I have seen a lot of people complaining about &amp;quot;rug burn&amp;quot; type reactions.  If you follow the directions this won&#x27;t happen to you.  I have super sensitive skin and fairly coarse hair on my legs and I had no problems using this.  As a matter of fact it worked great and I am wondering what took me so long to buy it in the first place.  I&#x27;ll never use a razor on my legs again.  Oh...I also noticed people complaining about it not working on the knees and ankles that well...again I had no problems.  Probably because I read the directions before using it.  And no...I am not being paid by Conair either (as suggested by one person here).  I just really like the product and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to have smooth legs.  Just follow the directions and it will work just fine for you!!!</li>
    <li> After a few days where she was unsure of the product because it was so different she now loves it.  The first few times of using it it she said it was abrasive to the skin.  She quickly learned however that if she took a shower right afterwards and applied lotion as normal all abrasiveness dissappeared.  She now raves about how painless it is and how long she stays silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this product b/c I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of hair/stubble on my legs. I got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave. This product indicated I could remove hair in about the same amount of time, but that it would last much longer than shaving. I purchased it and waited a week to receive it. Once I received it, I spent 40 minutes using it. In this time, I could have shaved both legs, both underarms, and my bikini line twice. Using this product, I was not even done with one leg. I went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period, and it did not remove a single hair. I pressed lightly, I pressed hard, I did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach, and nothing made this product work as indicated. Others may have had luck with it, but I did not. I was not impressed and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this gysmo 2 weeks ago.  It works ok, I&#x27;m not as happy as I thought I would be.  I have used it a few times and I find my legs are smoother, there is less hair, but I did have a problem with the &amp;quot;sunburn&amp;quot; effect.  After using for the first few times my legs appeared(and felt) sunburned- but it seems to get better with use.  My legs aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth, but it is better than before.  I still have to shave the ankle and knee area because I found it very difficult to get those areas with the size of the pad.  The good part: NO INGROWN HAIRS!  I loved it for the inside and back of my thighs.  Don&#x27;t overuse this product because you aren&#x27;t going to get all the hairs- if you do you will end up looking and feeling sunburned.   If you happen to over-do it, watch how hot the water is when you shower or bathe and use a sunburn gel with lidocaine and aloe to cool your self down.  It goes away in 2 days or so.  The &amp;quot;side-effects&amp;quot; weren&#x27;t bad enough that I quit using the product, I just learned the hard way and hope I can spare future buyers the discomfort that I had when I first tried it.  I have told my family and friends about this product- and most agree they like it and one found it very useful when camping and traveling.</li>
    <li> The Conair Ultimate Hair Remover is in reality the ultimate skin exfoliation system.  It removes hair by removing a micro-thin layer of skin.  This does two things:&lt;br /&gt;1- it removes dead, flaky, or rough skin, and&lt;br /&gt;2- it removes any hair in that area.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the product does a more complete job of smoothing your skin (knees, elbows, feet) than that of removing hair, but it does a good job of hair removal as well.  Hair seems to grow back much slower in treated areas.  If it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used the Conair unit, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s necessary to do a second treatment after waiting several hours or touch up spots with a razor to get all of the hair.  That said, it gives better skin exfoliation than any product on the market!  My knees have always been rough with dry flaky skin...They look better than ever now!</li>
    <li> Shaving gives me all sorts of problems, I must have super sensitive skin or something. I cannot afford laser and wax just isn&#x27;t my thing.  &lt;br /&gt;Grabbed this for myself before Christmas on a whim. It was money well spent! &lt;br /&gt;After 3 months of use, I have gotten the hang of the product. I suggest you practise then shave regularly for a month or more. Say, run the product over each leg once till you get used to it. Then trying to completely remove the hair. My legs are unbelievably soft. No rash, one little tender area after I spent too much time there. Do keep moving and keep a razor in the cabinet just in case. I still have trouble around my ankles. &lt;br /&gt;Hair regrowth is markedly thinner since I began using it. By about half. What remains still grows long but I&#x27;m, err, what does one call this process? - doing it once a week and only takes a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Hurts more than waxing, but at least I do not cut myself as I usually do with womens&#x27; &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razors.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Conair electric buffer several years ago and found it did not work as well as an epilator does for me on my sensitive skin.  HOWEVER, I discovered it makes an awesome callus buffer before a pedicure and for in between maintenance. Recommend using the Conair before a professional pedicure because it doesn&#x27;t tickle those sensitive areas on the bottom of the foot and actually does a better job!  Simply buff before or after a shower, then moisturize, and you will be amazed at how easily it buffs away those rough spots-covering more surface area than the electric and battery operated tools intentionally designed for pedicures. Delighted to find it still available since I have exhausted the effectiveness of the original pads-which are also easy to remove and replace.</li>
    <li> I have dark coarse hair on my legs and I have used razors as an 11 yr old lots of cuts, to using remington wet/dry shaver and it left stubble after using everyday for 2 wks as recommended. Epilators are too painful. I used this product and it removed more than the razor. It will take a few more times of shaving for a complete hair removal as recommended in the manual, but I have no complaints. There was no pain and the vibration was nothing. My legs felt very soft and I have a cooling lotion to use afterwards that gave my legs and invigorating treatment afterwards. Here&#x27;s a hint if you buy a product you are not aware of get it from a place wher you can return it. That way only the store would waste their money.</li>
    <li> Just got the conair hair remover and tried it. It worked well. With my sensitive skin and after having let my hair grow out a bit in anticipation of using the product I should have been more patient. I tried to remove every trace of hair from my armpits first. I Do Not recommend beginning with the armpit area. I am typing this with my elbows out. I put on a little emu oil, it&#x27;s strarting to help the burning. I read in another review that it takes several attempts before you are completely smooth and I don&#x27;t think they meant in one evening. Time must elapse, days, maybe longer. It will be worth it. Be careful around the ankles. Start slow. Don&#x27;t be all gung ho and go nuts with the thing. You have to get a feel for it and learn what to do in different areas. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I bought the Conair Hair Remover a few weeks ago.  I love it!! I have coarse, dark hair &amp;amp; it works for me.  At first I had to use it as much as a razor, but now, not quite as often.  It does take a little longer than shaving, but my legs are very smooth when I get done.  You do have to make sure you keep moving it over your skin.  If you press too hard &amp;amp; hold it in one place, you will get like a rug burn.  It is a little difficult around boney areas, but if careful, it can be done.  I bought this for my legs, so I still use the razor for my underarms.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these hair removers about 2 weeks ago.  The night I received it, I took it out of the box and used it.  My legs have never felt so soft.  It was completely painless except for a slight friction burn (handled with aloe gel).  I have very thick hair which needs to be shaved daily.  Using this product, I was able to go almost a week without shaving!!!  Thank you Conair!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great! i have really thick dark coarse hair and very white sensitive leg skin.  Red bumps from razor burn show up really bad.  I HATED shaving my legs.  It burned terribly and itched, and sometimes I even cried it hurt so bad and looked so terrible.  This product buffs away all the dry dead skin and most of my hair.  True, it does leave some stubble, but i just quickly go over my legs with a razor and it gets rid of that.  The razor does NOT cause any irritation bcz all the dead skin is not there to get snagged by the razor.  I have never been so happy with my legs in my life, and I have been shaving my legs since the 3rd grade (seriously).  If you have sensitive skin I really really really recomend this product.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of negative reviews, I decided to purchase this product anyway.   I am pleased with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;I have some hair on my upper back and shoulders.  I&#x27;m not a gorilla, but would rather live without it.  I have used epilators which hurt like HELL.   This product really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  But when they say &amp;quot;light, floating pressure&amp;quot; they mean it.  If a person presses it hard against their skin they are going to get friction burn.   &lt;br /&gt;After one 10 minute use nearly all is gone with just a bit of light fine stubble.  The directions say more than one session might be necessary at first.  This isn&#x27;t a problem.   &lt;br /&gt;I think this product is ideal for men since with the handle a guy could easily do his back (at least the very top) with no help from anyone else.   In my opinion this beats waxing, epilators, CHEMICALS and certainly shaving (GROSS!).    &lt;br /&gt;Ladies might want to be careful as they might have more sensitive skin and use on more sensitive areas.   If you purchase this product, go EASY with it until you get used to it.  Especially in areas that are sensitive.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my husband&#x27;s back and it did a great job.  he didn&#x27;t complain once and now all the hair is gone!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of others before buying, so was forewarned about not using too much pressure, etc.  I just gently rub my (dry)(read instructions) legs with it while I watch tv.  I&#x27;ve waxed for years, but that has begun pulling up the spider veins so I was looking for something gentler.  This works well, and even has the added benefit of getting rid of dry skin patches...again,don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure.  Love the way my skin looks and feels afterward!</li>
    <li> i bought this product almost 2 years ago from another online site and i still love it. the hint to using this product and for it to be effective AND still get multiple uses out of each pad is to make sure you skin is extremely dry. you cannot use the buffer if you have recently used some type of moisturizer. on the day that im going to use it i will not use lotion or a soap with moisturizer in it the day before. if u dont want to do that you can use a soap like ivory to dry out your skin before you use it. just make sure ur completely dry and oil free b4 u use it. also...you cant be in a room with heat. you will sweat and clog the pad. i know this seems like alot but it works and in time its second nature. all in all im done with both legs  in less than 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Using an electric sander to remove hair was an awful idea. The product left my skin burning.  I dropped the whole thing in the trash after the first use. I wish the rating system allowed me to give this item no stars.</li>
    <li> We use it to remove callouses from my feet. It would not work on my hair removal, and my hair is very fine.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this \\&quot;leg sander\\&quot; based upon what was said in the reviews.  The catch is that I&#x27;m a male competitive bodybuilder/fitness model and shaving just takes too damn long!  Since I have tougher skin than most women, I&#x27;m expecting pretty good results after the initial period it takes the body to get used to something new.  I&#x27;ll edit my post after I try it out.&lt;br /&gt;OK, I&#x27;ve used it very infrequently because it really doesn&#x27;t do much as far as hair removal goes, but talk about smooth legs!  This thing exfoliates incredibly well.  I&#x27;ll stick to shaving every few days and exfoliate weekly with the sander.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife primarily because she keeps cutting herself shaving -- she&#x27;s admitidly quite clumbsy. She has tried other methods of hair removal all of which were painful or messy or drove me out of the house due to the smell :(&lt;br /&gt;Before giving this to her I tried it on a spot on my leg. Now I don&#x27;t have semi-clean shaven legs like women...I&#x27;ve got Bigfoot-hairy man legs. This thing did the trick -- and how! It left a baby-butt smooth patch and removed every bit of hair without so much as a flinch. A few minutes later I re-did the patch and there wasn&#x27;t even the slightest trace of hair. I&#x27;m not sure how long this will last, but if it stops my wife from slicing up her legs, it&#x27;ll be worth it. Now where do we get refills?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two days it did exfoliate my skin unfortunatly I can&#x27;t enjoy the feeling of it because I still have loads of stubble and burns from the pads, and I didn&#x27;t press hard!  I realize it says to use it 2 weeks before you see optimal results but life is to short.  I have thick dark hair and maybe that is part of the reason it wouldn&#x27;t remove all of my stubble, Nair never worked for me either.  So to you other women out there with hair like mine and who have used other hair removal products that didn&#x27;t cut it, don&#x27;t think that this product is going to be any different.  Though using this product did give me a new appreciation for my old razor.  I&#x27;m going to try to return this tomorrow and buy a bunch of new razor blades!</li>
    <li> I spent over an hour trying to remove the hair from one calf and still didn&#x27;t get it all. I changed the pad, thinking I had a bad pad. It still didn&#x27;t work. This is definitely not the ultimate hair remover. In fact, it hardly removes hair at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this expensive item.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;ve only used this twice, not the recommended 10-12 times.  But in those 2 applications, I have been very impressed.  Yes, there was the inevitable &amp;quot;rug burn&amp;quot;, but it was dramatically less after the second attempt.  It DOES leave your skin remarkably smooth, if a bit stubbly (I expect this to go away with more use).  My recommendation is to have a very light touch when using this.  It does look and work just like an orbital sander for your legs.  I found it much more effective to &amp;quot;hover&amp;quot; it just above my legs - it seems like a recipe for disaster to touch it directly to the skin.  I didn&#x27;t even consider PRESSING it to my skin - that would rip it right off!  So HOVER, HOVER, HOVER!  I haven&#x27;t tried the sunburn lotion recommended by another user, but it seems like a good idea.  To sum up: Negative - yes, you will get rug burn, especially if you touch it directly to your skin.  But it should go away as you get more practice.  Go lightly!  Postive - smooth, smooth skin, and easy to use.  I expect that my rating will go up with more use.</li>
    <li> I have read many reviews that say that this gadget irritated skin and that it didn&#x27;t remove hair.  I have been VERY happy with mine.  I&#x27;ve had it for months, use it daily and haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with irritation.  I live in the desert, and the UHR does double duty as a shaver and exfoliater.  I even use it on the soles my feet.  I used to use a Dremel, but this is much easier, faster and safer.  The pads are costly and don&#x27;t last too long, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this thing is a godsend.  Also, I do not work for, nor do I have any connection with Conair.  I just hope that they don&#x27;t ever discontinue it.  I am considering buying an extra just in case.</li>
    <li> Conair HB1R Ultimate Hair Remover does what it says; removes body hair, leaves your skin smooth and doesn´t hurt a bit...all for an exceptionally low price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the buffing effect of this product ... but does it remove hair?  It is definitely not an ultimate hair remover ... it reduces the amount of hair but buffing them down a bit, but not entirely and not everywhere.  You&#x27;ll need to compliment it with razor or something else.&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased this product, I read most of the reviews and they all seemed to be very positive.  I&#x27;m always in hunt for better hair removing products and decided to give this one a try.  It is truly pain-free, but think about it logically, other than razors, there is no other way of getting the hair without pain ... if there was, don&#x27;t you think that all the salons would use it instead of wax???&lt;br /&gt;I have fine dark hair (on light skin) so it&#x27;s easy for me to see that it didn&#x27;t do what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;I admit, I was tempted to keep it just because -- as I mentioned earlier -- it does such a good job buffing the skin and making it feel smooth, but for this kind of money, it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping and I sent it back a few days ago.</li>
    <li> Finally, a hair remover that works! I have very sensitive skin and have always struggled with uncomfortable razor burn and unsightly red bumps after shaving. This product solved all my problems - it removes all the hair with zero discomfort!! The sanding action of the pad polishes your legs to a silky smooth finish you could never achieve with a razor. You also have the added convenience of being able to do this anywhere, without shaving cream or the tub. I highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> used it once and returned it. don&#x27;t even bother. shaving is better.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every hair removal process known to woman and oh my god, this one is the absolute worst!  Even after following the directions to the nth degree I ended up with raw legs!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> You might as well buy a sander, put low grit sandpaper on it and put it on low speed. Ladies, save your money. If you have sensitive skin, I hope you don&#x27;t break out like I did. I took mine back for a refund</li>
    <li> I have been waxing my legs for 3 years and decided to try something new. I bought this and i LOVE it!! i have had no pain or irritation and it&#x27;s less expensive in the long run! I have followed the tips given by others and they&#x27;ve worked! some areas are hard to get but i just go over them after a couple hours or the next day. i love it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how painless and easy this product was to use and have always been impressed with the quality of Conair products.  I followed the simple directions and did not experience any negative side effects.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be the answer to my shaving woes.  It wasn&#x27;t.  I have course hair and this unit is not intended for that.  If you have fine hair, it will probably work great.  It took too much time in one area for the hair to be completely removed thus creating a slight \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation in that area.  Doesn&#x27;t work well around knees and ankles.  The hair grew back quickly so I found this to be no more convenient than just shaving.</li>
    <li> Finally a hair removal product that is quick, easy to use and virtually painless.  I guess you could say when it comes to hair removal I&#x27;ve got a little OCD.  I&#x27;ve tried it all.  I&#x27;ve waxed, epilated, electric razored, basic razored (disposable to Mach3), I even tweezed my whole legs for a while (what a waste of time and energy-plus I had 1,000 ingrown hairs). I am currently undergoing laser hair removal under my arms and for my bikini area (Holy OUCH).  I have thought about doing my legs and arms with laser hair removal but it is sooooo expensive and soooo painful (a Lortab and a Xanax and I still can hardly make it through a session).  I bought the Conair HB1 Hair removal system to try on my arms and legs and WOW!  Talk about ease of use and baby soft skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting started you should know that it does make the treated area feel like it is mildly sunburned but I came up with a wonderful after treatment regimine that I&#x27;ll let you in on later.  First of all make sure your skin is dry and free of lotion, oil, etc., I found that rotating the unit clockwise was the most effective method (when rotating counter-clockwise the unit seems to skip around).  It also seems to work better on coarser hair than fine hair, but it does work. Watch out for those moles! Only run it over the area with moles ONE time or you will burn/irritate it. The dust/powder that is produced is annoying but after you feel how smooth your skin is you won&#x27;t care. The knees are best treated with them being bent tightly and take your time around your elbows and ankles. When you&#x27;re finished treating, wipe off the white powder with a damp washcloth (no soap) then use a burn relief aloe vera and lidocaine gel (you can find it by the sunscreen). Using regular lotion will sting for a long time after while this will only sting for a second on your arms and hardly at all on your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so much better than an electric razor because it exfoiliates so your legs are way smoother, plus it is faster. It is better than a regular razor because you don&#x27;t get bumps (ingrown hairs) or cuts, and you conserve water by not shaving in the shower. It may not remove hair from the root but it does a hell of a better job than the painful epilady and silk-epil. It is just as messy as waxing but it isn&#x27;t sticky, just dusty, and again there aren&#x27;t any ingrown hairs to deal with. You CAN&#x27;T use it on your bikini or your face. It doesn&#x27;t say anything about not using it on your pits and I think it may feel odd at first but it would do a great job smoothing out the skin and removing the hair in that area, just take your time and keep the area stretched tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the results, just keep in mind it takes practice to get used to it. My knees have never been softer or smoother!  Remember to keep them bent! Good luck and I hope you like it as much as me :).better than a regular razor because you don&#x27;t get bumps (ingrown hairs) or cuts, and you conserve water by not shaving in the shower.

    <li> Believe everything you&#x27;ve read in the recommendations including my review: this is the most amazing hair removal product you will ever use.  I just got mine tonight and within 5 minutes of it being in the house, I was already using it.  My legs feel like silk!  All the hair and dry skin is gone and my legs look fabulous (if I do say so myself!).  No cuts, no bending in two in the shower...you just put your leg up on the bathroom counter and start &amp;quot;sanding&amp;quot; away.  10 minutes later, you&#x27;ve got smooth, hairless legs.  My husband was astonished at how well it worked and he loved the feel of my skin afterwards.  I am DEFINITELY sold.  I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t know about this sooner.  I&#x27;m going to e-mail every woman I know tomorrow and tell them to get one of these bad boys.  This is INCREDIBLE!!</li>
    <li> I read a review that said this didn&#x27;t work well on fine hair and I beg to differ.  I have extremely fine hair and I found this product both easy to use and quite effective.  Finally an easy way to remove leg hair... and it exfoliates at the same time.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product NOT remove hair, but it gave me a horrible rugburn-like rash.  (Yes, I followed the directions carefully).  It basically buffs your skin and leaves nasty dust all over the place but the hair doesn&#x27;t go too far!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;d rather wax!!!</li>
    <li> Well, it does remove hair, and it isn&#x27;t painful when it&#x27;s removing hair, but after that....yaaooo[...]&lt;BR&gt;It may be b/c I have coarser hair, but I had to take a long time trying to remove my hair and when I was finished everything was fine, for about 5-10 minutes -sooner if you apply anything to your skin. Then it feels like you&#x27;ve got the worst sunburn you&#x27;ve ever had... even water burned me. &lt;BR&gt;Even so -because it was recommended to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; to the product- I attempted this form of hair removal about five different times. Every time with the same result. &lt;BR&gt;Perhaps if you have fine hair, this is the product for you. Just, be careful.</li>
    <li> I did try this hair buffer, It left my skin in pain. Did not remove the hair for more than 3 days and the hair gets thicker.    I hope you do not have to try it for yourself, Its painful and your skin does not feel the same until the second week.    You are better off shaving</li>
    <li> My suggestions...&lt;BR&gt;1. Follow the intructions completely.&lt;BR&gt;2. Shower or rinse off afterwards.&lt;BR&gt;3. Supplement hard to reach areas with razor.&lt;BR&gt;4. Don&#x27;t overuse since hair will stay away longer.&lt;BR&gt;5. Your skin will be sensitive afterwards so plan accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;If you do all of this you will LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be very safe. It is like taking sandpaper to your skin. Left burn marks on my skin. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and when we started using it we felt that may be conair just forget to test this :) it dont worked for us at all. i tested it almost 4 time but the same result. the bleds get weared out in just 1-2 use so be ready for huge after purchase expanses. I returnde this to target and got Remington EP1000 Women&#x27;s Smooth &amp; Silky Hair Removal System from amazon for 25$ and it works great Read my review for this if you are intrested.</li>
    <li> It was ok on my legs. First time I used it I must have used it for too long because my legs got bad friction burns. After that, it did a mediocre job on skin. But, I use it once a week to do both heels (one to two pads needed) and it clears away my calluses in no time!  I have to buy a lot of pads but it beats using a callus file!! Way faster (&amp;lt;2 minutes) and easier.</li>
    <li> I have to say I don&#x27;t use this as a hair remover. Maybe on a quick bust need a touch up on my legs before I ru  out the door. However I do use it to remove the dry Crack skin off my feet an oh boy is it great at that.  I live in AZ a  wear flip flops year round and my feet show it. But this little guy helps take care of that no problem. Try it yourself and save the money on a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 years now and for me it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.  I do not use it alone however.  I suffer badly from ingrown hairs and by using the sander a couple of times a week (and yes, even on my bikini line) my ingrown hair problem has disappeared.  I use the sander and then shave my legs and while in the past without using the sander my legs still felt stubbly, with the sander they are baby smooth for days after. I find I have to shave my legs far less often.  For these reasons I give it a 5 star rating. I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to buy this item because of all the reviews of intense pain.  Despite that, I bought it to try it out.  I think it works great.  I&#x27;ve experienced no pain whatsoever.  There is a slight warming since you have to put the spinning disk against your skin, but there was no pulling.  In fact, at first, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything.  It was pretty gentle.  Perhaps the others are pressing too hard.  Try it lightly until you start to see results.  The only thing I would have liked to see is a longer handle to make it easier to reach the middle of my back.  Overall, it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and thought, \\&quot;Why not... I&#x27;ll try it.\\&quot;  The woman who bought the gift for me also has one and told me NOT TO APPLY ANY PRESSURE when using the device.  As a redhead, I have extremely sensitive, thin skin so I followed her advice very carefully.  I did not apply any pressure what-so-ever, and didn&#x27;t keep the device in one area for too long.  The result..... worse than any sunburn I&#x27;ve ever had!  My legs are burned in various areas, as the product sanded off the first layer of my skin!  The skin hardened and has begun to crack in the burned areas.  I&#x27;m a little concerned and think I should call my physician, as the condition is extremely painful.  Worst of all, the hair grew back immediately the next day and I had to shave the areas that were not burned.  This is a terrible, dangerous product!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  First, it does say you have to use this 10-12 times in order for your hair to get use to this.  I admit--I have only used it twice.  However, I bought this hoping to eliminate the need for a razor and this product does not do that.  There are many places where you cannot use this hair remover including the bikini area, around the knees and ankles, under the arm, etc.  I gave myself a &amp;quot;rug&amp;quot; burn trying to remover hair on the back of my leg--behind my knee.  In addition, I have a feeling that the pads that were included will be used up quickly and I will have a hard time finding replacements.  Even if I can find replacements now, eventually this product will be history and then I will have a product that is worth nothing but I paid $50 for.&lt;br /&gt;A good razor does a better job--I recommend Venus!</li>
    <li> I completely agree with the &amp;quot;Please don&#x27;t waste your money!, November 9, 2003&amp;quot; review from: gonefission from Peoria, IL United States.&lt;br /&gt; The description of the product is word for word of what I&#x27;ve felt and have experienced except I do not have dark, thick hair.</li>
    <li> Hair removal, don&#x27;t think so. Hair buffer is more like it and it&#x27;s an excellent skin exfoliate. I was excited about this so I ran and bought and used it as soon as I got it home. It worked like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;So why are there so many bad reviews on Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;This is what I think. If you&#x27;re expecting it to remove the hair, it won&#x27;t. It buffs the hair away. There&#x27;s nothing in the world that&#x27;s painless AND removes hair. Secondly, it&#x27;s probably best if you have thick or coarse hair. The product I think is designed to work best with that type of hair. I don&#x27;t see how this would be effective on someone who has fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Used correctly and with patience, this is an amazing way to get rid of that unwanted hair. Though you won&#x27;t look like the model on the box, (because you know she&#x27;s airbrushed) you&#x27;ll have soft, smooth skin when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
    <li> I have this conair for 2 weeks now.. it&#x27;s more than great. I really don&#x27;t understand why some poeple say it&#x27;s painfull! because it is just the opposit. it&#x27;s a miracle! No pain at all, not even a little. much more better than a razor since it exfoliates greatly so you forget about dry legs in winters. I used to moister my legs every day with lotion, but now, thank to the exfoliation, my legs look always clean, shiny and so smooth. &lt;BR&gt;I use it no more than twice a week, yes the hair begins to grow right after one day but it grows soft and fine and not all over.. that is, the hair grows gradually, every day some of the hair grow wich is great because you wont need to use conair again until a week and even more, and you still can show your legs. &lt;BR&gt;Here is a trick that worked perfectly for me.. before using conair for the first time, I hair removed with wax, so the growing hair was fine and thin, and then I used conair and the hair was so easily removed, that I haven&#x27;t even seen any under-skin hair that usually appear after razor. &lt;BR&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend using anything other than wax or sugar for hands, but HIGHLY recommend it for legs.</li>
    <li> Whoever says they like this product was obviously paid by Conair.  This is the worst piece of junk I have ever wasted my money on.  And how about the false claims that your you&#x27;ll be hair-free for two weeks?  How can this be possible since you are not removing hair at root...you are only sanding hair off.  I have fine hair, and the next-day stubble was worse than shaving, plus my skin was raw.  It is so loud you will need earplugs.  It only works on large, flat parts of the leg, so you&#x27;ll have to shave the rest anyway.  The pads need replacing just about every time you use them, at like $7 each.  You&#x27;d be better off buying a sander from your local home-improvement store and sanding your legs with it.</li>
    <li> It did remove hair on most of the surfaces, but I could not make it work in concave areas. It made my skin really irritated. Irritation was so severe, that I had to go to the doctor and use medicated cream for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Hair started to grow back next day.</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to finally stop shaving when I purchased this machine. I purchased this product about 3 months ago. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair. It removes dead skin nicely, but the hair remains. I still have to shave.</li>
    <li> Burned the mess out of my brown skin, but it did wonders for the heels of my poor working feet.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this,I would have rather had razor burn, then the burn that I got from this! Not to mention it doesnt take your hair off all the way. It SUCKS</li>
    <li> We have a tiny bathtub which is hard for me to get into and out of so this is just great!  I now have non-hairy legs again!  I used udder balm as an alcohol-free moisturizer after I was done.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the Conair Ultimate Hair Removal system in July, 2004 and I LOVE IT!  If you READ THE DIRECTIONS and follow the simple instructions, you should be really pleased with the results.    I have light, fine hair and sensitive skin that usually breaks out in little red bumps after using a razor or stings and burns after using a cream depilatory.  The Conair Hair Removal system left my skin REALLY SMOOTH.  After using it, there is a fine white powdery dust left on your skin, which I rinse off with clear water.  Then liberally use a \\&quot;healing\\&quot; skin lotion, one that you already know doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin (without perfumes or alcohol).  I did NOT like using it under my arms.  It may be that my skin is just too sensitive there, but I got a real \\&quot;burn\\&quot; and had to use an antiseptic ointment for a day or two.  Other than that, the Conair Hair Removal system has worked GREAT for my legs and I plan to continue using it as long as I can get the replacement pads!</li>
    <li> i did not like this thing at all. it took too long to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; my legs. it didn&#x27;t even remove all of the hair. it irritated my skin as well.</li>
    <li> I have dark, very coarse hair on my legs, underarms, and bikini area.  I&#x27;ve been frustrated with the results of regular shaving.  For example; I shave in the morning and by 5:00 pm that same day, stubble appears.  Even when I&#x27;m freshly shaven, the dark roots of my hair can be seen just under the skin. Ingrown hairs are also a problem, even though I use a loofah sponge to exfoliate regularly.  I was looking for longer lasting results.  Home waxing does not work for me.  Nair and  similar cremes cause rashes, and I can&#x27;t afford professional treatments.  (Salon waxing / lazor tx/ etc./ too expensive.) &lt;br /&gt;FINALLY: &lt;br /&gt;I have acheived the desired results; legs silky smooth to touch and lay eyes on, using a Braun Epilator (plucks hairs out by the root using 12 rotating \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot;) followed by the Conair Hair removal system (I call it a polisher).  The Braun Epilator removes all hairs long enough to be tweezed, leaving behind ingrown hairs and some micro-hairs, hairs too short to be tweezed.  The Conair System uncovers all ingrown hairs, removes most of the hairs uncovered along with the micro hairs.  After using the Braun Epilator, the Conair System, and moisturizer, my legs feel silky smooth.  The smoothness lasts for days, not hours.  &lt;br /&gt; Wonderful! &lt;br /&gt;The only downside: I use one polishing disk per leg, each time I exfoliate.  I wish the disks would last longer.  Bottom line; &lt;br /&gt;my legs appear smoother and feel silky longer than they do w/ shaving, so overall, I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
    <li> This is not good for removing hair but I have had mine for almost 10 years now and I use it to buff away dead skin on my heels.....its better than a pedicure!!! I never bade cracked heels anymore thanks to this handy thing! My daughter uses it on her legsin between shaving....she buffs awy the dead skin Celsius then lotions her legs....be careful it will cause friction burns if you hold it too long in one spot</li>
    <li> Being a slicer and dicer, I am so thrilled to finally have a product that doesn&#x27;t draw blood.  The first time I used it I noticed how soft my skin was and needed not one single band aid!  Hooray for woman kind!  I will never use a razor or rip my sensitve skin off with wax or burn myself with depillatory products ever again.  Trust me ladies, you will love this hair remover.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I first saw this product.  I saw some positive reviews for it and thought \\&quot;Hey, if other people like it, then surely I will too!\\&quot;  Boy was I wrong.  &lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for the \\&quot;magic\\&quot; hair remover for ages.  I hate shaving, waxing hurts, and depilitories are a joke (at least for my thick, dark hair - you fine-haired folk might see better results with all these products).  So I purchased the Conair Ultimate Hair Remover, very anxious to see the amazing results that other people were talking about.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it was not that bad.  It DOES remove hair (by grinding it off with sandpaper, literally).  But, it does NOT remove hair anywhere near as well as shaving or waxing.  There is still a little bit of stubble when you&#x27;re done, and it just can&#x27;t be buffed away.  I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of stubble on my legs, but if it doesn&#x27;t bother you, then you might prefer using this product over shaving.  &lt;br /&gt;The instructions say that you will probably have to use it several times to get the full benefit (that being, longer intervals between needing to buff, and finer, thinner hair regrowth).  I know everyone is different, so I can&#x27;t speak for other people and their hair - I&#x27;m just giving you my personal experience.  I used the device for 2 weeks straight, every single day, and went through 3 of the 4 buffing discs (yes, they do wear down that quickly, and beware - replacement discs are $5 EACH direct from Conair), and did not notice my hair getting finer or thinner, and if anything, I felt like I needed to buff MORE often - not less.  And watch those shins and knees ladies - if you keep the buffer on a bony or sensitive area too long, you&#x27;ll get a nice red, burning rash from rubbing your skin raw.  The worst part is, the red burning skin doesn&#x27;t appear right away, so you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve burned your skin off until later, and then it&#x27;s too late.  &lt;br /&gt;So, after my two weeks of fun with this product, I gave up and went back to shaving.  Now, let me just add that (as I have alluded to already) I do have very thick, dark, coarse hair.  It doesn&#x27;t respond well to most types of hair removal, except shaving.  And my hair also grows pretty fast.  So it could just be that I am the wrong type of person for this product.  If you have finer, thinner hair that grows more slowly, then you might find this to be such a bad deal after all.  I think it varies from person to person.  &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I did give it 2 stars because it does a nice job of exfoliating.  Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buy it just for that purpose - go get a $5 loofah sponge for that.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all.  It barely took off my hair but instead took off my skin!!!  I had burns all over.  It is a joke, do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> &amp;quot;Wow a pain free hair removal system! No more nicks and scrapes! No more burning skin from depilatory creams!&amp;quot; I happily bought this little wonder thinking I had in my hands the answer to all my little female questions about hair removal. WRONG. To say this device does not work is an understatement; it does however accomplish the power sanding version of rug burn. As they say if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. Save your money and your razor!</li>
    <li> I received my Conair unit yesterday and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. It&#x27;s a simple, painless method of hair removal....but you have to follow the directions carefully for the best outcome. Make sure your legs are completely dry before using. Rinse your legs off after use (they get all powdery), and don&#x27;t apply any moisturizer for at least an hour or so, to avoid irritation. &lt;br /&gt;I knew that this &amp;quot;orbital sander&amp;quot; would work because several months ago, I actually used a very fine emery board on my legs, just in small areas, to see if &amp;quot;buffing&amp;quot; would remove hair. It did, but there was no way that I was going to spend HOURS doing two legs with an emery board.  :(    &lt;br /&gt;The Conair works beautifully on my very sensitive, extra-dry skin. I only made a minor error in my overly-enthusiastic pursuit of hairless legs, when I applied a little too much pressure in some areas and had temporary burning sensation. Other than that, the Conair is an answer to my prayers!</li>
    <li> I returned mine because it&#x27;s a miserable piece of designing distaster.  Seriously.  I thought it sounded like a great idea, so I ordered one.  Used it.  As I was using it, I thought to myself, &amp;quot;Gee, this feels like I&#x27;m using a fine grade sander.  I wonder why this doesn&#x27;t end up chafing people...?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with red, chafed skin.  Then little bumps.  It was probably five days before the sunburn effect finally went away.  Please o please, use a razor or have your legs waxed.  Don&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> I received the Conair Ultimate Hair Remover as a Christmas gift from my husband after suggesting that I might want to try it as I had read that it was great for exfoliation. It is fabulous for exfoliation and I hope I can always find refills for it as I plan on using it for a very long time. It removes hair readily which was not really what I wanted it for, but I am very happy with its hair removing ability. My legs feel smooth after using it and free of the dryness they usually have. I use it before I shower on dry legs that I have not used an emollient on for 24 hrs. I have not experienced a problem applying a moisturizer after showering, but I have used only a Neurtogena body oil or a Vitamin E cream. I have no complaints about this product and from reading other reviews can only speculate that it works best on those with extremely dry skin, and perhaps not so well with those blessed with normal to oily skin.</li>
    <li> I saw this on tv, and thought it would be perfect.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the &amp;quot;Hair Mitten&amp;quot; and I thought this would be a bigger, better, faster version -- no way!  Yes, my legs were smooth the first few hours, but it&#x27;s been 2 weeks now, and the hair grew back just the same and I&#x27;ve shaved my legs a few times. Not to mention this machine tore my legs to shreds, making them the scaliest things you&#x27;d ever wish to see and/or feel.  Did I mention the stinging when trying to apply some moisturizer, even DAYS later?  Awful!  very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe it is misuse that can cause serious problems with this design.  I think overall, it is a bad idea for people with sensitive skin, like me.  It does not give the results it promises.  In fact, I found the results worse than shaving and more painful at times.  For one, the stubble is present, it does not give you the smooth 2 week shave it promises.  I think it really needs to be reported for false advertising.  I am keeping it only for exfoliating reasons.  It does exfoliate large areas well.  In that it has value to me.  As for hair removal, it works but not for long and it can cause hot painful rashes over large portions of your legs.  I did find a solution to the pain ladies!  Use &#x27;Hawaiian Tropics Cucumber Melon Soothing Aloe Vera&#x27; a couple hours after and regularly.  It will take away the pain (although it packs an initial application sting) and it works to sooth the skin.  It can give harsher results than chemicals and I HATE CHEMICALS.  The best way to use this product if you decide to keep it, is gradually.  Use one day, go over the areas gently once, skip a day (applying your soothing gel regularly) and then do it again.  Your skin can be conditioned to overcome the irritation, like microderm abrasion.  It takes consistent gentle use over a regular period of time.  Eventually, in some cases, your skin will be able to handle the gentle daily procedure without as much irritation.  Again you need a soothing gel, patience, and time.  Don&#x27;t do too much, too fast.  Don&#x27;t do it for a long period of time trying to rid your legs of stubble.  Your results will be very bad.  However, with all the work and effort, is it really worth it?  I use it only for exfoliating now, once a week.  It does act as a good duo with an Epilady Legend, that removes the hair by the root.  Use the Legend though, the cheaper Epiladies aren&#x27;t as good.  Don&#x27;t use them back 2 back though.  The Epilady you will only need to use once in awhile, the Conair HRS I would recommend using it every other day until your skin builds up a tolerance (GENTLE USE, GOING OVER THE LEG ONLY ONCE) and then GENTLE use once a week for EXFOLIATING only, if you wish!  Remember, using a SOOTHING GEL regularly is a MUST!  It can also prevent scaling skin results.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it gave me a rash on my armpit and legs.  It is not painless.  I&#x27;m still searching for an alternative to shaving.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it on my feet to smooth the rough skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I hate dealing with the nicks and cuts that go along with shaving.  I&#x27;ve also tried depilatories, but my skin is too sensitive.  Mostly, though I hate the maintenance involved in achieving hair-free legs so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a product that completes this chore fast, and maximizes the amount of time between hair removal sessions.    First off, using this buffer takes FOREVER.  An hour or longer to remove hair only from my legs is excessively long.  Second, while the process itself doesn&#x27;t hurt, the next day my legs felt as if I had a wicked sun burn and that sensation didn&#x27;t go away for several days.  Third, this product was extremely ineffective at removing hair!  There were stubborn hairs that as much as I tried this buffer just couldn&#x27;t remove (my hair is very fine except by my ankles...it is coarser there).  And finally, after the red patches from the \\&quot;sunburn\\&quot; went away I had stubble!    I&#x27;m on to using an epilator-type product instead.  My advice:  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s perfect for legs.  I only wish it were more readily available and replacement sanding heads could be found.  (I haven&#x27;t looked in several months, so maybe this has changed)  I found that if I use an old toothbrush and warm water to clean the sanding head after each use it doesn&#x27;t clog and I&#x27;ve only worn out one of them in a year&#x27;s time.  The first month I used it once a week, which soon became only about every two weeks.  Now, the little bit of hair that grows back is fine and barely visible and I have to seek out bright light to see if I need to &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; it yet.  Love it!  I finally removed my old razor from the shower and never looked back!  I bought one for my daughter, who loved it so much she bought one for her son&#x27;s girl friend!  NOTE:  this was too abrasive for the face, and probably &amp;#34;bikini lines&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re so inclined.  But for the day to day problem of leg hair, it&#x27;s an affordable alternative to shaving!</li>
    <li> wife used it for years on legs, works great on rough skin on heels too! BUT, just a few months ago you could get this product for just $40 and the pads for $8 (used to be lucky enough to find them at Big Lots for 50 CENTS!!!) Now it&#x27;s $109?? No thanks...going to Home Depot and getting high grit sandpaper!!</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work.I am sorry I order this product and my time wasted and money on returning the item</li>
