      <li>it&#x27;s nice to be able to store them inside of each other</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>My suitcase can remain neat and wrinkly free even when I need to get to something on the bottom thanks to these cubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far every person I have traveled with has commented that they need to buy some after seeing mine and in fact I need a couple more.  </li>
      <li>Get organized before your next trip by using the handy and every durable EgoBags.  </li>
      <li>Looks to be very durable and a great value compared to other products out there.</li>
      <li>Super fast service.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First time we used these.</li>
      <li>I came across this set of bags from Egobags that are made from nylon and it seems like it&#x27;s pretty durable.</li>
      <li>absolutely love the fact that with these travel packing bags I know exactly where everything is, and nothing will come flying out if at the airport if they decide to open my luggage.</li>
      <li>Many travel cubes were the same price or more for only three cubes and</li>
      <li>It made it much easier to find what I needed instead of digging through a tote bag!</li>
      <li>so many stuffs inside one bag and searching for each of them later can be frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;Takes</li>
      <li>The first time I saw an advertising video about Travel Packing Cubes was on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;z0CHLLT_JCo</li>
      <li>It is a funny video, but</li>
      <li>I hope to order more in the future!</li>
      <li>The zipper pull broke the first week of my 6 week trip.  </li>
      <li>Will be great for travel for organizing my suitcase no more digging around trying to find something!</li>
      <li>I wish they were a little deeper and more square shaped, but it works fine.</li>
      <li>I bought two more large size cubes at a local REI store, each one</li>
      <li>I travel a lot and have had to struggle to fit my clothes and other items into my traveling bags in a neatly organized way that gives me easy access to these times on transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Needless to say, I am returning them, thanks to Amazon&#x27;s wonderful customer service.</li>
      <li>I really like them very much.</li>
      <li>Makes organizing clothes much easier.</li>
      <li>My clothes stayed pressed and ready to go.  </li>
      <li>really recommend this 4 pc Set: the Egobags Travel Packing Cubes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Travel Packing Cubes!</li>
      <li>you travel a lot, I highly recommend getting some of these cubes!</li>
      <li>When you need to grab something out of your suitcase, and it&#x27;s on the bottom layer, it seems like the whole suitcase now gets all messed up as you are digging for what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I Thought this is just a fancy products, but was surprised to see how useful these bags are.&lt;br /&gt;Packing</li>
      <li>Much easier to find that special scarf, t-shirt, etc because likes are together and not loose in the suitcase.</li>
      <li>Now, with these stylish and durable packing cubes, my shirts stay unwrinkled and all my other stuff is well organized.</li>
      <li>The compartments are so well designed and easy to distribute so many small and larger things in.</li>
      <li>But one thing I love about the Egobags brand is the tough, but flexible material and the fact that they are liquid resistant, come in 4-pcs sets, dirt resistant and easy to clean with wet wipes if you need to.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is absolutely a great product and people who are always traveling should definitely invested in purchasing these cubes. This is coming from someone who travels at least once every two months with only a laptop bag and carry on.</li>
    <li> With 3 kids age 5 and under storage space is always at a premium.  The different sizes make it easy to distinguish a specific size for a specific kid. Also, when not in use it&#x27;s nice to be able to store them inside of each other so they take up less space.</li>
    <li> I got ANOTHER set for me and a set for a friend.  This is my 4th set. I travel often and these packing bags are awesome. I pack lingerie; cosmetics; hosiery; hair curling irons and serums, etc. When I get where I am going; hotels, homes...wherever I am staying; all I have to do is just take the packing cubes out of the suitcase and put them in the drawers or just leave them in the suitcase.....the case might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
    <li> I love packing cubes for traveling!  You can get a lot of clothes packed into a carry on with the use of packing cubes! I want to get more for my whole family!</li>
    <li> This will be great for summer.&lt;br /&gt;I can never can keep food cool enough.&lt;br /&gt;These Packing cubes will do the trick</li>
    <li> If you are like me, when I pack a suitcase, I just toss everything in there in layers....shirts, pants, underwear, socks, etc.  When you need to grab something out of your suitcase, and it&#x27;s on the bottom layer, it seems like the whole suitcase now gets all messed up as you are digging for what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these cubes, I can now pack my &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; in separate cubes.  So now when I need to grab some socks, I can remove the various layers without messing things up.  My suitcase can remain neat and wrinkly free even when I need to get to something on the bottom thanks to these cubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you travel a lot, I highly recommend getting some of these cubes!</li>
    <li> What an awesome product. It&#x27;s great for women and mothers on the run or travel. Keeps everything organized.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product late afternoon on June 7th, and received it in my mail box on June 10th.  Was shipped from Las Vegas, NV and arrived at my home in way northeastern NY.  Super fast service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packing cubes seem to be of great quality, and light weight.  The color is a beautiful light blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for something like this.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I purchased these Egobags for twenty dollars at the same time I purchased the similar 3 pack of Ebags. The Ebags were five dollars more and didn&#x27;t include the smallest bag. Therefore I thought I would end up getting more of these, as they seemed like a better value, however I wanted to have both in hand to compare the quality. Well once receiving the bags from both companies, the Ebags were clearly a superior product. The material it was made from was softer and more flexible, seeming less likely to crack with time. Another downfall of these Egobags is that they are heavier. When it comes to packing for a long trip, I need every extra ounce I can get. Lastly, when I went back to check these prices, these Egobags had jumped in price making them MORE expensive than the Ebags. Needless to say I would definitely purchase Ebags, not these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to note: After packing these for my trip, I noticed a 2 inch gap between the mesh and the zipper on the medium bag. I don&#x27;t think it ever got sewn in properly. Needless to say, I am returning them, thanks to Amazon&#x27;s wonderful customer service. Overall, very disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> The quality of the bags is not comparable to the ones I bought online from another seller which I paid about the same money for.</li>
    <li> I give these a &amp;#34;hesitant&amp;#34; four stars for the reason that I thing the zippers are bound to fail.  Price wise these were far and away the cheapest I could find.  Many travel cubes were the same price or more for only three cubes and occasionally two depending on the brand.  Having said that I am very unsure if they will last because of the zippers.  Immediately upon opening I thought the zippers seemed cheap and flimsy and after two trips long distance I am only more sure they will eventually fail.  However in fairness they have not failed and again you will be hard challenged to find four bags four this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note ... If you have never used travel cubes before and are curious ... buy some!  So far every person I have traveled with has commented that they need to buy some after seeing mine and in fact I need a couple more.  Whether or not they are Egobags I HIGHLY recommend buying packing cubes if you are a frequent over even semi frequent traveler.</li>
    <li> my husband and I use the packing cubes for overseas trips and even those 1 or 2-day trips near home. The best part of the cubes is being able to take out each cube as you need whatever is packed in them. Much easier to find that special scarf, t-shirt, etc because likes are together and not loose in the suitcase. Can&#x27;t do without them now and have purchased for friends who also find them extremely helpful.</li>
    <li> So, these bags are delightful with one exception: the quality of the zippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second to smallest bag, after only two weeks of use, no longer has full zipping capabilities. One of the zippers has given up and refuses to be budged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packing cubes, in theory and in practice, were a great way for me to keep all of my affairs organized in my backpack/carry-on. I think they also helped me to pack light, as I never wanted the cubes to be &amp;#34;busting at the seams&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The zipper pull broke the first week of my 6 week trip.  The returns period expired while I was traveling. Out of luck all around with this item. Buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I used these for a train trip this past week and really like the convenience of packing like items together in the cubes.  It made it much easier to find what I needed instead of digging through a tote bag!</li>
    <li> When I travel, I usually take my Sharper Image Folding Suitcase which has lots of pockets for organizing, but my shirts and jackets always come out too wrinkled. Now, with these stylish and durable packing cubes, my shirts stay unwrinkled and all my other stuff is well organized. I recommend these packing cubes for anyone who does a lot of traveling and doesn&#x27;t want to waste a lot of time on the ironing board.</li>
    <li> I loved the 4 cubes.  I used all 4 sizes.  I packed clothes for 3 days in the large cube, extras (bathing suit and skirts in the middle size, underware and night ware in the small size and the tiny one was used for cosmetics.  I bought two more large size cubes at a local REI store, each one the price of the Amazon set, to pack for the other 7 days.  The cubes filled up my 27&amp;#34; bag with only a little space on the edges.  Since we stayed inn 4 different hotels, I was organized for each hotel.  As I emptied one case, I packed dirty clothes in that case.  My clothes stayed pressed and ready to go.  I will always use packing cubes on future trip.</li>
    <li> These Packing Cubes are great for keeping my carry on items organized especially when having to go through the security checks.  They are durable and very easy to store when I get to my location.  Also great to grab for going to the beach!</li>
    <li> I was always having to empty my complete suitcase to find what I needed. Now all I have to do is pick up my cube and it&#x27;s there for me to see. Always Quick and easy and no fumbling around in the case for what I need.</li>
    <li> First time we used these. They were great. Makes organizing clothes much easier. Allows packing more items and keeping things separated. We were skeptical at first but now swear by them.</li>
    <li> I love to travel, but I hate the stress of packing and unpacking. I always overpack when I travel for business or pleasure leaving me with heavy, huge bags that are way too big. I came across this set of bags from Egobags that are made from nylon and it seems like it&#x27;s pretty durable. I know a lot of new parents who have a ton of bags with them, this would seem to consolidate their needs when traveling too. I would definitely at least use this for the gym to carry everything and be able to sort clean clothes from dirty ones. I also love the design of the Egobags...it is quite neater than other types of Packing cubes I have used before. The fact that you have 4pcs set is awesome! I hope to order more in the future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had travel items like this before, but never in a set that allows me to organize more than just my toiletry items.  And the nylon that makes it so durable--what else could one need for travel, other than somebody to do the packing for you!  It&#x27;s like taking your favorite dresser drawers on the trip with you.  They&#x27;re even good for conveniently storing and organizing things at home.</li>
    <li> These bags are convenient, durable, and fit a lot of storage. How can you go wrong? they make packing a little less of a headache. Love them!</li>
    <li> Will be great for travel for organizing my suitcase no more digging around trying to find something! I would recommend for those who need a quick method of packing.</li>
    <li> They served its purpose for my trip.  I was able to pack 2 weeks worth of clothing.  I wish they were a little deeper and more square shaped, but it works fine.</li>
    <li> Hey, guys,&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this 4 pc Set: the Egobags Travel Packing Cubes. The compartments are so well designed and easy to distribute so many small and larger things in. The Nylon is a quality one, the design is great and the functionality is superb. I really like them very much. The first time I saw an advertising video about Travel Packing Cubes was on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;z0CHLLT_JCo It is a funny video, but so true.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the set and You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;Greetings!</li>
    <li> Thank you for this great product! It is light and I can carry everything I need with me. Great idea for organization! I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> These packing cubes are absolutely awesome! I am thankful that I decided to purchase them for my recent week long vacation to Europe. I travel a lot and have had to struggle to fit my clothes and other items into my traveling bags in a neatly organized way that gives me easy access to these times on transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cubes simply saved me the hassles of stuffing my cloths inside my travelling bag and having them all ruffled and rumpled by the time I get to my hotel room. I simply arranged all my travel clothes, into different packing cubes and added my toiletries into the smallest cube. The 4-psc set was a great bargain! I stumbled upon it and was blown away by the size and the quality of the material. The nylon material and zipper did the job! They kept my clothes neatly arranged and organized throughout the trip. But the amazing incidence was the ease with which I emptied my traveling bags and packed them again while going through the airport check-point. Just for making it possible for me to get through the airport check-point faster than usual, I am forever in love with these Egobags Packing cube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I reached my hotel room, unpacking was as easy as picking each cube and placing them where they should be. On opening each of them, I found my clothes neatly arranged and organized just the way I packed them before the trip. This is truly the most convenient way to pack and travel these days! But one thing I love about the Egobags brand is the tough, but flexible material and the fact that they are liquid resistant, come in 4-pcs sets, dirt resistant and easy to clean with wet wipes if you need to. It makes it useful for both personal and family packing during trips! I will be ordering more of it soon as gifts to friends and families.</li>
    <li> Great for packing and keeping things organized. Breathable and can see through the mesh to know what is packed in each cube. No longer have issues with overstuffed suitcases and items spilling out if the airlines do a manual search of your bags. Great idea!</li>
    <li> These bags are perfect for keeping your luggage organized, pretty blue color too, the 4 pieces are nicely sized and a good value. I think I will order a second set if they travel well.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this great product it is light and I can carry everything I need with me on all my trips.  I would recommend it to all my friends. Ector Sidhu</li>
    <li> I RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO LIKES ORGANIZATION..THESE BAGS CAN TAKE THE HASSLE OUT OF PACKING OR STORING YOUR CLOTHES...THEY HAVE SO MANY USES THAT COULD BE OF HELP TO ANYONE ANYWHERE...IF YOU WANT TO GET THE CLOTHES IN ORDER BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> Great items for travel!  Help to organize all the different stuff one has to bring when they travel. My clothes and cosmetics always end up in a mess and these cubes let me locate items easily when needed.</li>
    <li> Great space saver and wrinkle reducing product. Helps you pack like a pro.Saves space and packing time. Ify you travel frequently this will be a life saver.</li>
    <li> These bags are great for traveling.  We camp alot &amp; we use them all the time! I would recommend these to anyone, great for organizing!</li>
    <li> At least I won&#x27;t have to worry about my cloths all tangled-up or my make-up smashed when I travel. These little cube bags make traveling and packing really convenient. Even going to the gym is so much easier now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for concealing your Intimate Items. The bags are made of a Liquid Resistant Material so its also great for families with kids that need to pack their juices and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I like that they come in a 4pc-Set of different sizes. I have so much makeup and these bags are perfect for it.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the fact that with these travel packing bags I know exactly where everything is, and nothing will come flying out if at the airport if they decide to open my luggage. We all know how annoying that can be, right?</li>
    <li> Get organized before your next trip by using the handy and every durable EgoBags.  They help keep everything organized, what goes into the bag is what comes out of the bag.  Also saves time when you looking for a particular item, they are see-through, you only have to open/unpack one cube and not the entire bag.</li>
    <li> I am amazed how this product makes it easy and convenient to travel! Looks to be very durable and a great value compared to other products out there. This will make a great gift for anyone. Only wish I had this before my last trip to TX!</li>
    <li> These travel cubes make a lot of sense to me. Under normal circumstances travel to or from usually ends up in clutter when you start to unpack and try to find something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the cube travel packs it reduced the clutter and keeps things organized, less stress coming or going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product for it&#x27;s functionality not to mention durability.</li>
    <li> I Thought this is just a fancy products, but was surprised to see how useful these bags are.&lt;br /&gt;Packing so many stuffs inside one bag and searching for each of them later can be frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;Takes up no space. Took the clothes out of the bag and left them in the cubes.&lt;br /&gt;Different size cubes worked best for me. Works great and so convenient!!</li>
    <li> The Travel Packing Cubes are AWESOME!! I do a lot of traveling/camping and these cubes are perfect for that, very convenient and durable. The different sizes allow me to keep everything packed and organized. And I don&#x27;t have to search through each bag to find what I want; I can see what is in the bags through their nylon mesh top covers. I&#x27;ll be buying more sets to give to my son and daughter and their four children. The grand kids will each get a cube. I highly recommend the Travel Packing Cubes!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing it keeps everything organize without all your little personal items ending up in the bottom of your suit case.</li>
