      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t buy those cheap $2 ones.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think these would hold up to intense use, but they&#x27;re a good product for home use.  </li>
      <li>The Shears were sharp and cut hair perfectly.</li>

      <li>These Sheers are light weight, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>The size is just fit to my hand and is easy to control.</li>
      <li>They work just fine for what I bought them for.</li>
      <li>I use them fine but have to keep from opening them all the way, to avoid the tooth that is bent.  </li>
      <li>Used them a couple of times, works fine..</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly, and they work like a charm!</li>
      <li>with these scissors my hair can be volume free</li>
      <li>Cuts smoothly like butter.</li>
      <li>Also, some detailed hair still need scissors.</li>
      <li>The ones I received are cheap, crappy and look and feel like toy scissors.</li>
      <li>But those $2 ones probably aren&#x27;t worth more than 25 cents which means THEY are overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After 3 weeks I was excited to receive a package in the mail.</li>
      <li>Very pleased...works fine for me!</li>
      <li>Overall, though, they look really nice and seem to operate smoothly, plus they were really cheap.</li>
      <li>A good size for my short hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered this to replace one I had for years, lost to Super Storm Sandy.  </li>
      <li>It looks something really cheap when you first look at it, but when you use it, it would give a feeling of excellence.</li>
      <li>For me, who has decently large hands, it is completely fine.</li>
      <li>Came quick and they&#x27;re nice for grooming my chinese crested powderpuff</li>
      <li>Or better yet, buy them at your local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply where you can easily return them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice construct works good</li>
    <li> These Sheers are light weight, and easy to use. A good size for my short hair.</li>
    <li> Love them just what I wanted</li>
    <li> I got this shear to thin out my hair for a better result in styling. It&#x27;s sharp and comfortable to operate. I can do it by myself at ease.</li>
    <li> Ge careful of the quality!  These cut chunks out of my hair!!! :(</li>
    <li> These are great thinning shears. This was my first time thinning my hair myself instead of going to the salon and I was worried but my hair turned out great with the help of a youtube video and these shears. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I use it for my 4-year daughter when I make her a haircut.</li>
    <li> The Shears were sharp and cut hair perfectly. Now my wife can thin and blend my hair just like they do at the Barber Shop. I give this item a four star rating because of the size. I thought they were shorter than regular thinning shears, however, they perform the same.</li>
    <li> I got this thinning hair scissors in the hope of upgrading my old pair. I was debating between this and some other models, and eventually went with this pair. It is a good decision. The scissors are much sharper than my old pair. Feels solid in hand. Some complained about the ring size. For me, who has decently large hands, it is completely fine.</li>
    <li> Does not cut well at all.</li>
    <li> These scissors are great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that i can get rid of A LOT of unwanted volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually when i go to the haircut place they do not take off enough volume so I have had to cut my own hair, with these scissors my hair can be volume free&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> kind of sticky and choppy to use...  I think it is better to pay more and get a better product, when will I learn???</li>
    <li> I purchased to do dog hair, a Westie (white terrier with active growing hair).  I had a real inexpensive pair and purchased these expecting a big improvement. No big improvement.  Better? Not much.</li>
    <li> These are the first hair thinning shears I&#x27;ve used and as an amateur, I can say that they&#x27;re pretty easy to use and do the job. Also, it&#x27;s very affordable and it&#x27;s really helpful for me since my hair gets very thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hair dresser, nor did I want to spend a large amount on &#x27;professional&#x27; thinning sheers.  So when I ordered these, I suppose I held my breath a bit and hoped.  These are WONDERFUL.  Good clean edges that do a great thinning job, good construction and quality.  And SO inexpensive.  These deserve a whapping A+!</li>
    <li> Im not Barber but my wife uses them to cut my hair and they work great!</li>
    <li> I love this shear. The size is just fit to my hand and is easy to control. The only problem is that the screw in the middle of this shear is a little too tight so the shear is not so easy to open and close. Also, some detailed hair still need scissors.</li>
    <li> not the best one out in the market but you get the product you pay for. If you have a lot of volume, you might find this a bit dull.</li>
    <li> great for thinning my bangs!waiting to try it on my daughters thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;great item for the price. try it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no hairstylist. I&#x27;m just a guy with super thick hair who doesn&#x27;t want to dish out $25 every two weeks to get a cut. When My hair starts getting a little long on the top but the sides are still short, I just run these through once or twice and rinse. Now I get my haircut once a month and all I have to do is take a little heat from the stylist because I made the mistake of telling her what I was up to. Paid for itself immediately. As far as quality, they seem very sturdy and they don&#x27;t pull on my hair.</li>
    <li> Thinning Shears are great if you cut your own hair. Since it&#x27;s a difficult task, don&#x27;t get a cheap one. This one is great!</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t used these, despite getting them over a month ago.  I wanted to thin out my hair so it&#x27;s not so crazy when it gets longer, but I have resigned myself to just keeping it shorter.  Overall, though, they look really nice and seem to operate smoothly, plus they were really cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use occasionally to thin my dog&#x27; coat.  These look like thinning shears, but they simply do not cut.  Even tried them on my own hair and nothing.  You may be lucky enough to get a good pair, but I would suggest spending a few more dollars for better quality.  Or better yet, buy them at your local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply where you can easily return them.</li>
    <li> They are good and easy to use, thought they mightbe a bit Longer, like those used in salons,  but they work well</li>
    <li> They work great! Very well constructed, they feel very solid. Cuts smoothly like butter. Good for all kinds of hair</li>
    <li> I use these to thin the hair on the back of my head and they work quite well. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m an international student study in US,I&#x27;m now a short hair and my hair grow so fast,i need a good scissors to brush out, when i got the scissors, i&#x27;m so happy and then i started to cut my hair, it is easy to use it.</li>
    <li> These work great. They are very sharp and provide a nice clean cut. These will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> These work, but they&#x27;re rather stiff.  Doesn&#x27;t cut as smooth as other thinning shears I&#x27;ve used.  Might have to cut a few times to get desired effect.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re lovely :) I use them to cut my hair and my friends hair.  They work great! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I admit it.  I cut my own hair.  To be clear, I can afford to pay someone to cut my hair.  I shop on Amazon after all.  I have places where my hair is almost as thick as when I was a lot younger.  Now my hair grows thick in one place and thin in another.  These scissors help even things out when my head gets lopsided.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them, but I do recognize they are not professional quality like at the barbers.</li>
    <li> A reasonably priced shear that works exactly as it should. I use it on my Rough Collie to trim leggings etc so it gets a workout. Easy for me to use, so many implements are too small for my hands this one fits.  Excellent product that works as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m able to trim my kids hair at home between haircuts and these scissors allow me to make it look pretty good.</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinning shears and am very disappointed because I&#x27;ve been anxiously awaiting for them to arrive. After 3 weeks I was excited to receive a package in the mail. When I opened it, it was a completely different pair from what I I ordered!!! I&#x27;m so bummed!!! The ones I received are cheap, crappy and look and feel like toy scissors.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all, some tooth are broken and always got stuck when I use it. Besides, it looks like an old one. I hope I can return it, but I will need to pay the postage at my own cost, that&#x27;s not fair for me, I&#x27;m very angry about that.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality. Will not cut hair...or anything else.</li>
    <li> Trouble at first, I had to tighten the little bolt in the middle with my fingers. Perfect now.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed as scissors received are rather small.  They were adequate for cutting my brother&#x27;s thick wavy hair though.  Will&lt;br /&gt;order larger scissors next time.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy pair of shears.... needs a cushion on the rings.</li>
    <li> Pros: 1) its cheap&lt;br /&gt;  2) It cuts well&lt;br /&gt;  3) arrived fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1) when you open the shears all the way, the two blades get stuck in each other and you have to jiggle them to get them free this can be somewhat annoying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> I have very very thick hair and your Thinning Shears certainly thinned my hair.  It is now more manageable and I don&#x27;t have to&lt;br /&gt;spend more time.  The scissors must be really sharp because when I gathered up a handful of hair and started cutting...the&lt;br /&gt;scissors had no problem with my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;~juneBloom</li>
    <li> I like them and they work great! I wish they came with more in depth instructions though on how to use properly.</li>
    <li> These scissors are perfect for thinning and very easy to use.  They assist in styling and making hair smoother.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I got these on a good price. Used them a couple of times, works fine..</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them much, they don&#x27;t seem to cut very well, you really have to chop away at the hair to see any come out.</li>
    <li> They rusted overnight after the first use.</li>
    <li> The teeth of the scissors are not in the same level, so it works not smoothly, very easily stuck the hair.</li>
    <li> This one really works as a thinning shear and the size is just right for me.  It does the the job as described and I like it, it makes my hair trimming job at home a lot easier.</li>
    <li> These thinning shears are great - I use then when I groom my dog. Its resally helpful in the sense that my dog no longer has sharp angular pieces of hair. It makes his face softer. Also, it cuts well!</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed by these thining shears. Either they are made with the dullest blade possible or it was invented by the devil himself. When I tried to cut my hair with these, it wouldn&#x27;t cut the hair completely and I had to go at it like a hack saw. In order for my hair not to have the most insane split ends, I ended up having to re-cut with regular shears and cut off wayyyy more than I wanted to repair what these shears did to my hair. TERRIBLE! Wish I could get those 3 inches of my hair back :(</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace one I had for years, lost to Super Storm Sandy.  This pair made me realize how good the pair that I lost was.  These don&#x27;t cut well.  Once you find the &amp;#34;Sweet spot&amp;#34; that actually works, it takes a few passes to get results.  I don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> sent it back to difficult to use.</li>
    <li> They tend to act like scissors and actually cut your hair</li>
    <li> They work for what I bought them for, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of money... but one of the teeth catches quite often, toward the handle.  I use them fine but have to keep from opening them all the way, to avoid the tooth that is bent.  I could probably bend it back a little and they would be fine, but they are just a little flimsier than I would have expected.</li>
    <li> Works well...plus I got another additional hair scissors that cuts well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Only $9 and you only have to buy once. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. I tested it out on myself a little and it works excellent. Feels very sturdy in the hand and I expect these will last many years. 5 stars for a great product! Glad I didn&#x27;t buy those cheap $2 ones.  These are a bit more expensive but not overpriced. In fact for the quality these are an excellent price. But those $2 ones probably aren&#x27;t worth more than 25 cents which means THEY are overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, highly recommend! Works excellent, excellent price for the value.</li>
    <li> I finally find a great tool to cut my own bangs! I usally go to slon to cut the bang but paying for 20 bucks each time. How I can cut my own bangs now.</li>
    <li> The shears are awesome!!!  They arrived quickly, and they work like a charm!</li>
    <li> Great, sturdy scissors. I used a dab of clipper oil for the middle screw and they glide very easy during use. They cut great and I feel they will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Worked great fast shipping!/</li>
    <li> Sharp and does the job nicely.  I&amp;#34;d like them to be a little longer but overall a nice pair of thinning shears.</li>
    <li> Saw this exact scissor at a store under a different brand for $40 yes THAT MUCH! So what are you doing spending so much for branded scissors these work perfectly for skilled Hair , Grooming and Nonvice artist both dog and Human hair work with this scissor.</li>
    <li> They really worked well.</li>
    <li> These are really cool, thin your hair with em&#x27;</li>
    <li> If I had it to do over, I would not choose this brand.&lt;br /&gt;-Shipping took absolutely FOREVER. That is okay  - I wasn&#x27;t really in a big hurry.&lt;br /&gt;-The scissors are not very good though. My son has extremely thick and coarse hair. I have learned to move my fingers in a way so that I am squeezing the blades together while I am also squeezing my hand together to cut. If I fail to do that, it pulls hair. I&#x27;m assuming they are not quite as sharp as they should be?&lt;br /&gt;-I wish I had spent the extra money on the more expensive, assuming they would be better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these would hold up to intense use, but they&#x27;re a good product for home use.  I have long, thick hair, and I used these for layering and thinning.  Recommend getting some instructions on technique before cutting your own hair....</li>
    <li> These are great, although I think they are for dog groomers.  Worked very well on human hair.  Takes the bulk out of thick hair.</li>
    <li> I got these shears to do my own bangs and it worked great! My project was successful and my bangs turned out to be professionally done-looking.</li>
    <li> These shears are as advertised. They work just fine for what I bought them for. What else is there to say - I don&#x27;t know why Amazon has a minimum word count so I am just filling in with this garbage.</li>
    <li> I know I wasn&#x27;t buying the most expensive thing but this works great! You&#x27;re getting a good product for your money.</li>
    <li> Exactly the thinning shears I needed to do my hair cutting.  Recommend it to anyone who needs it to thin out the sides.</li>
    <li> Great shears. Took me a while to understand how to work them, but once I did I got the nice &amp;#34;finisher&amp;#34; look to my comb over.</li>
    <li> I impulsive bought these one night like an idiot but am very happy with the quality of the shears. Heavier than I expected.</li>
    <li> Like it.  Does it&#x27;s job.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> It looks something really cheap when you first look at it, but when you use it, it would give a feeling of excellence.</li>
    <li> Terrific hair thinning shears</li>
    <li> I actually believed the other reviewers... and went ahead and bought these. I have a hard time opening and closing them etc... Please spend a little more.</li>
    <li> Well... I used it to cut my own hair and the overall experience was great. It is pretty handy as well.. I would give 4 out of 5 for this product :)</li>
    <li> Very pleased...works fine for me!</li>
    <li> Cuts poorly. Rust easily. Very Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like these shears im in cosmetology and they really come in handy when thinning certain clients hair and for the price its a great deal , im really happy with these thinning shears</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get them because i really wanted to cut my bangs but i read on YouTube its better to do it with this type of shears.So i tested it a little on the ends of my hair and i clapped down at least 3 times in order for the hair to cut it works but it  takes some time. I wasnt happy :c</li>
    <li> Wont be buying from again .Didn&#x27;t even work unreal... back on the hunt for another pair of hair thinners not happy</li>
    <li> not efficient, not sharp, very blunt&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend you for this one&lt;br /&gt;basically, you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I order one pair of thinning shears and got two pairs do cheap plain shears!  How cN you screw that up?</li>
    <li> Very nice, I like it a lot. It&#x27;s useful。 it&#x27;s beautify too.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m ware looking for. Thanks you.</li>
    <li> Works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;My wife cuts hair with then and they are much better than her previous shears.</li>
    <li> These work well... and are VERY sharp. (I almost cut off the tip of my finger the first haircut.... my son moved fast and it was him or me... I chose me.  Lots of blood... But obviously this is NOT the fault of the product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do seem to pull the hair a bit as they cut... is that normal?  It makes my son cry.  But they do cut well.</li>
    <li> These shears are nice for the price.  They thin my hair the way I want to give it a texture and more voluminous look.</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all.  Bought to thin out the thick hair on our Boarder Collie.  They will not do the job.  Save your money.  I will spend a bit more and get a better quality pair of shears.</li>
    <li> nice product but shipping a little slow.</li>
    <li> It was thicker than I expected. Only good for final trim .</li>
    <li> I like to use it because I have bulky hair that get out of control and it brings  back to lay it down like it should be when I can&#x27;t get to hair place!!!!  Best thing if your hair to get to lay down another five Stars!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ended up getting these and regular shears. Came quick and they&#x27;re nice for grooming my chinese crested powderpuff</li>
    <li> Works just as I expected! Great product!</li>
    <li> Useful scissors, great quality</li>
    <li> These work really awesome. So glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> worse pair or shears i have ever bought. dull at arrival. dont buy</li>
    <li> Made in and shipped from china look nothing like item pictured.  Works.</li>
