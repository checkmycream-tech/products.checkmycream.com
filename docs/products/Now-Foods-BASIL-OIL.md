<li> This basil oil is high quality in my humble opinion.  </li>
<li> As usual, the Now brand lives up to its high standards.</li>
<li> I add a few drops of this mixed with my facial moisturizer or organic unrefined coconut oil for skin care.</li>
<li> but has a slight anise flavor when added to foods such as stir fry.</li>
<li> but that&#x27;s typical of essential oils.</li>
<li> rejuvenating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am partial to the N.O.W. brand as their tops are user-friendly and don&#x27;t require pressing down while twisting to actually access the product.</li>
<li> But this Now brand basil essential oil smelled way too heavily of Anise for my liking.  </li>
<li> you can only use a few drops.</li>
<li> Yesterday I reviewed this product and while I was pleased with the timeliness of delivery and quality of product, I was disappointed in the packaging as my product had leaked and a quarter of the bottle had been lost.</li>
<li> In less than 24 hours, the shipper responded to my concerns and gave me a partial refund!</li>
<li> The down side is the smell.  </li>
<li> my daughter refused to come near me when she smelled the basil oil on my skin unfortunately.</li>
<li> Use VERY little of that anise flavor will over power everything.</li>
<li> I barely use it because of the awful smell.</li>
<li> , been there, done that for a cold, so I avoid that at all costs, ladies on the um.. pill would know, I would think?</li>
<li> Smells really bad.</li>

    <li> 100% Basil oil but has a slight anise flavor when added to foods such as stir fry. Use VERY little of that anise flavor will over power everything.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t like writing reviews so all i am going to say is ... I like it and you will too. That is all :-)</li>
    <li> High quality essential oil at a great price. Food grade. I add a few drops of this mixed with my facial moisturizer or organic unrefined coconut oil for skin care. Also a great scent on its own. Now Foods has the best oils.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice essential oil.  Good price and a reputable company to purchase essential oils from.  Is EXCELLENT to cook with.</li>

    <li> great oil. works for mucus.</li>
    <li> This is awesome along with tea tree oil and peppermint oil. I got a bite from a bug and it was in a crease on the side of my inner knee where you sit or do any type of workouts pretty much it was rubbing it. I just put a drop of this with tea tree oil and the mosquito? bite that was huge and red puffed around the bump started going down. I used it several times during the day time, and its almost all gone. I got basil just in time I believe! I thought it was going to be a infection and I&#x27;d have to go to the doctor and try not to be on antibiotics, been there, done that for a cold, so I avoid that at all costs, ladies on the um.. pill would know, I would think? Anyways I really didn&#x27;t have the money for a doctors appointment since no insurance, even with insurance, I&#x27;m sure this was the cheaper and all natural route to go. So this and tea tree plus peppermint oil to make the itchy go away helped big time!!!!</li>
    <li> good oil !!! thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to keep flies away and it really works for keeping flies away from you. I would recommend for that.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve loved other brands of basil essential oil, and other varieties of Now brand essential oils.  But this Now brand basil essential oil smelled way too heavily of Anise for my liking.  I wish I&#x27;d had a sniff of this particular one before I&#x27;d ordered it.</li>
    <li> I love tinkering around with essential oils and coming up with new blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basil goes very well with grapefruit and Bergamot.

    <li> I order basil for pain in my knee.  It helps to relieve. The down side is the smell.  My family hates it, but I use it anyway!</li>
    <li> I love Now foods essential oils. They are always fresh and potent,  and the dropper insert is pretty reliable. I always come to this brand because of the price and quality.</li>
    <li> Tried basil oil to increase milk supply (1 of countless things i have tried) and it didnt work for us, bc my daughter refused to come near me when she smelled the basil oil on my skin unfortunately. But i am sure they work good for aroma therapy.</li>
    <li> Quality Oil, fair price reliable brand.</li>
    <li> I am making salve from this oil.  At first I didn&#x27;t know how to use it, since it cannot be ingested.  But I&#x27;m using it as an anti-inflammatory on arthritis before bed.  It has a relaxing aroma and does help with arthritis pain.</li>
