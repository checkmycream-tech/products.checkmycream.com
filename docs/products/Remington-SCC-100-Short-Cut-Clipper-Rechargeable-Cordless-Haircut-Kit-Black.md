<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy to use and very flexible settings</li>
    <li> see ya later barber shop... no more 15.00 buzz cuts... this one does a great job!</li>
    <li> Pure crap, worked for a week, now it cant hold a charge for longer than 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> I hope remington continues to make this product as it works perfectly and saves me a lot of time.  I got about 7 full haircuts and several quick trims before recharge.  Charging is no big deal.  You can&#x27;t beat this product for the functionality and convenience.</li>
    <li> Despite reading many negative reviews, I bought one and have had no problem. Works just like it claims. I suspect that the people who wrote the bad reviews either didn&#x27;t read the instructions or didn&#x27;t understand them.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best head shaver I&#x27;ve come across. I&#x27;ve shaved my head with clippers for the better part of 15 years and this all I need. The rounded blades work well with the contour of your head. I remove the guard to get the closest possible cut. The width of these clippers make it less likely that you miss a spot. Makes for a painless, easy and quick job. As long as you clean and oil it along with periodic charges it will last a long time. I would advise against leaving it on the charger continuously in between cuts, I feel like it shortens the battery life. Great shaver and it also helps with shaping my beard. Must buy.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 3 months and in that time have given myself 5 haircuts. It works as described. It is quick and efficient, just remember to clean the comb often, like after every back and forth. It makes a big difference. I keep my hair at about a quarter of an inch, the #2 setting on the unit. I do find it takes multiple passes both side to side and front to back to get all the stray hairs. In my case maybe 10 minutes from start to finish. Keeping that 10 minutes in mind I have gotten 3 full haircuts out of one charge. After the third it was still running strong but I didn&#x27;t want to chance it running out of juice halfway through a fourth haircut. This unit combined with my Andis T-Outliner for the cleanup is simple to use (Have to recruit the wife to do around the ears) and it has paid for itself already compared to the barbershop.</li>
    <li> I dropped it a couple of times in the shower and a piece came off.  I couldn&#x27;t put it back together!  The clipper worked fairly well to keep my hair short every 2 weeks.  I liked how it was one length.</li>
    <li> This clipper works great and is easy and simple to use.  The only drawback is that the battery cannot be replaced.</li>
    <li> Tired of barbershops? I was when I bought this three years ago. I have now saved about three hundred bucks, and am just now having some battery issues because I left it discharged for a while. Don&#x27;t do that. This is the best of the personal hair trimmers I have used. It is so simple to just comb your hair and with the settings you can get it as short as you like. You will come to depend on this as I have, so take care of it. Remington really got this item right. Great gift item as well.</li>
    <li> The hair trimmer works just fine.  Its the charging unit that isn&#x27;t worth a plug nickel.  After about three charges it stopped charging.  I checked the charging unit and found that there was no output.  I bought another similar unit from Radio Shack and was able to again charge the unit.  I am aware that I could have returned it to Remington under the warranty but those things are more of a hassle than they are worth.  Perhaps Remington should find another vendor for their chargers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the unit is concerned, it performs exactly as I hoped it would.  I trim my hair every three to four days and it never looks as though it has grown.</li>
    <li> Edit 11-18-2009:  I&#x27;ve used this thing three times now and it&#x27;s worked very well each time.  That&#x27;s $60 in savings on hair cuts so far, so it&#x27;s more than paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing really gets the job done once you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you currently have medium to long hair or if your hair is dense I highly recommend getting a haircut at a barber before you start using this thing.  Otherwise, you&#x27;re probably going to run out of battery power before you&#x27;re finished.  The battery on my Short Cut ran out just as I was finishing up the back.  I had charged it all night and all day (sixteen hours as recommended in the manual).  Yes, that&#x27;s right, when you buy this thing you have to charge it for a full sixteen hours before the first use to get maximum battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had medium to long hair when I started and the trimmer kept getting bogged down when I tried to comb it through my hair, so I had to make lots and lots and lots of passes to get it trimmed down to where the trimmer was fully functional even on the 4 setting (the longest setting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this thing is when I go to the barber they never cut my hair the way I want it cut -- they can only give me a \\&quot;number two\\&quot; or a \\&quot;number one\\&quot; etc. unless I go to an expensive stylist.  I&#x27;ll tell them \\&quot;I want a crew cut\\&quot; and they&#x27;ll trim off half an inch and go \\&quot;is that short enough\\&quot; and I&#x27;ll say \\&quot;no, shorter.  Crew cut.  Do you understand what that means?  I want it short, like an army haircut\\&quot; and they&#x27;ll start over and do the whole thing again, taking off another quarter inch until I get tired of asking and just go home with my hair longer than I want...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I want is a short, \\&quot;crew cut,\\&quot; and this thing gives me exactly the cut I want.  It cuts all of my hair uniformly to the same length, all around.  For the cost I&#x27;m probably going to save a lot of money and annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in the other reviews, you&#x27;ll want to get a trimmer for the sides and around the ears.  They can be had pretty cheap.  I didn&#x27;t try the one on the Short Cut but because of the shape of the Short Cut I decided it&#x27;d be too awkward and I might botch the job.  Speaking of botched jobs, you&#x27;ll want to have a few bucks on hand the first time you use this thing so you can go to the barber and have them fix it if you mess up too badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that even though you can cut your own hair with this thing you&#x27;ll probably want to get someone else to trim up the back and behind your ears.  The first time I used it, I forgot I had taken off the adjustable comb and went to finish up the back, and cut a huge nick out of my hair down to the skin.  Fortunately it was far enough down that my roommate was able to use my trimmer to shore it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, hair will go everywhere.  EVERYWHERE.  Fortunately hair is easy to vacuum up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my sigourney-weavermatic.s and around the ears.  They can be had pretty cheap.

    <li> The first clipper I got did not work.  I sent it back and the 2nd one works.  The battery doesn&#x27;t seem to last long so I worry it will not be good enough in a few months but it&#x27;s fine for now.  My head has some bumps ;) and uneven areas and at the lowest setting gave an uneven look.  Looks OK at the higher settings.</li>
    <li> For those, like me, who shave their head to the same short length, these clippers are very well designed.  The light feel and curved bi-directional blades make it a snap to cut my hair each week.  BUT...the battery is absolutely horrible.  It takes forever to charge and barely lasts one cut.  You can&#x27;t use the clippers with the cord attached so you are stuck having to charge overnight each time you plan to cut your hair.  Too bad about the battery because everything else seems to be designed to be used each week to keep your hair trimmed neatly.  But with the effort required to navigate around the battery&#x27;s shortcomings, it is nearly impossible to use it weekly.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE! - You will see many reviewers on here giving reviews a few months after owning the product and most of them have pointed out that the unit dies.  It worked great for the first 2 months.  I loved it - it was cheap, and worked as advertised!  But after 4 months the unit would start shutting off about 45 seconds into cutting (after a FULL charge).  I found out I wasn&#x27;t the only one.    Why don&#x27;t they just let you plug it in and use it?  The \\&quot;cordless\\&quot; battery feature is not necessary (who cuts their hair where there is no power source?) and that feature is the reason it died.  The battery on this thing is useless and makes the product worthless.</li>
    <li> Simply the best for us balding short-hair do-it-yourself guys.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PURCHASE. BATTERY LIFE IS NOT WHAT I AM USED TO IN TRIMMERS. THE UNIT DIED THE 2ND TIME I USED IT. I&#x27;M AFRAID TO TRY IT ON MY HAIR AS THAT WAS THE MAIN PURPOSE FOR PURCHASING IT. THE BATTERY WILL PROBABLY DIE HALF WAY THRU. I&#x27;M GOING BACK TO WAHL.</li>
    <li> The Remington Short Cut Clipper is excellent for its stated purpose. As one who has recently decided to keep my hair trimmed very short, what some call a \\&quot;buzz-cut\\&quot; I have found it frustrating and tedious to maintain the cut with conventional hair clippers. I would miss places and would have to negotiate with the electrical cord in order to cut in all directions, since my hair wants to be curly when longer. With the Remington Short Cut Clipper I have attained an easy, brief daily maintenance device. It sits where my hair brush once resided, plugged in, fully charged and ready when I am at the basin doing my daily grooming, etc. I unplug it, check that the length setting is still where I left it last and then brush it back and forth over my scalp just as I would if I were brushing my hair. In about a minute and a half I am finished and I see an even cut all around.    I thoughtfully read product reviews as I decide whether to buy something I&#x27;ve not physically touched and examined. In this case I found some of the reviews to be confusing because of their negative ratings and the reasons for them. The Remington Short Cut Clipper is a device that is meant to be used for maintaining a very short \\&quot;buzz-cut\\&quot; and it does that very well.</li>
    <li> This product already has a ton of reviews, so I doubt mine will make a big difference.    The product works, as advertised. You can cut your own hair, without a mirror, easily and the results are great.    It may suck for long hair, but I don&#x27;t really care. My hair is SHORT and the more patchy and grey it becomes, the shorter it becomes.    Make sure you fully charge it and it will not run with the charger plugged in (odd?).    I use it like a toothbrush, cutting my hair every day. It is that easy.    Downside: no case, so I bought a small travel cube for storage.</li>
    <li> The cutters only take a little with each pass, so u have to go over and over and over to be sure you got a full and even cut so it takes a long time to do even a basic trim.    Batteries were ok for the first couple uses but after that they wouldn&#x27;t hold enough charge...and they don&#x27;t work when plugged in so you&#x27;re outta luck!    save your money and pass on the short cut... The get a FAIL.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair cut short and was looking for a product that I could use between going to the barber every two weeks. When I saw the Remington Short Cut, I said \\&quot;I gotta get me one of those\\&quot;. I received the clipper on August 13th, the same day I went on a two week vacation. On the ship, I was cutting my hair twice a day, that is how much I enjoyed the clippers. When I got off the ship, I spent a week in Florida and introduced my brother to the clippers, in fact I had to leave them in Florida for him and purchase a new set when I arrived back in New York. It is so easy to use, it os like brushing your hair. It is now November, my barber is wondering what happened to me, I have not been back to see him.These are the clippers I wished I had years ago, they are Great.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly...used it twice so far on the same charge and it works just fine, make sure you charge it before using it the first time but never keep anything charged on the regular all the time, that kills the batteries. so if you charge only before using for 16 hours or so as the instructors say than your just fine !!!</li>
    <li> So apparently this is the only hair trimmer that is curved?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old one worked great for about 8 months.  Slowly but surely charge times increased and operating time decreased due to battery life.  Eventually no matter how long I charged it the trimmer would operate for 5-10 seconds and shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the money I save by not going to the barbershop every 2 days I can probably buy a dozen of these and be set for a few years.  Or at least until I&#x27;m rich enough to afford hair surgery.  Damn this receding hair line :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* Bought a replacement and this one lasted about 8 months as well. Again battery. Oiling the clippers helps a little bit. Time to buy another one :-/</li>
    <li> Works terrific, paid for itself after 4 months use, no more paying for haircuts. This is the second one for me and that is the only downside, the first one only lasted a little over 2 years. Again it did  pay for itself , but I would have thought it to last longer. We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised until either the battery or the charger dies, one or both of which will within 3 months of purchase.  I have owned 2 of these.  Switched to the Wahl Balding Clipper with a guard; it separates the men from the boys.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had three of these miserable products which work great the first time, or even for a short while.  HOwever, they all seem to go bad and the motor or whatever mechanism it is that drives it and keeps it running fails.  It&#x27;s really a shame because I&#x27;ve never found a better clipper.  The shape and speed with which you can cut your hair is fantastic.  I guess that is why I&#x27;ve bought more than one - hoping each time that the next one will work.  Save your money and don&#x27;t but this piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> This is my second unit:  the first one died after the warranty expired. That unit had a problem with the battery and charging unit.  Hopefully, this one will last a bit longer.  As far as function, with my nearly bald head and short beard, I find it works very well and even though the first unit expired after only two years, I saved a ton of money compared to going to the barber every week.    All in all, a good value.</li>
    <li> Not to belabor the issue as many others have already chimed in on this, but I can also confirm that the battery would no longer charges after ~6 months of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a Braun electric toothbrush set with rechargeable batteries that is still going strong after over seven years of daily use, and I own many other consumer-grade products with rechargeable batteries and this product is easily the worst at holding a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just to be crystal clear here, if you can&#x27;t charge this, you cannot use it, unless you think it would make a handsome paperweight. (It won&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clever idea but horrible execution.  Fun while it lasted -- sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> A curved haircutter! Excellent idea! It makes keeping a simple short hair style easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> This clipper is great!  My first clipper slowed down after about 18 months and didn&#x27;t stay charged very long.  I called customer service and they sent me a free replacement.  The original clipper lasted another 5 years and finally crapped out after a gazillion haircuts.  I threw the original away this morning and opened my replacement clipper.</li>
    <li> My husband is a 61-year-old balding man who decided to \\&quot;go with the flow\\&quot; and cut his hair very short since it obviously wasn&#x27;t going to get any thicker! He has very fine, thin hair and these clippers just couldn&#x27;t get all the hair no matter how many directions or times he went over his head. It was very easy to use and he liked the idea of being able to cut his own hair, but these clippers just couldn&#x27;t get the job done. Remington offers a 30-day money back guarantee so we sent them back.</li>
    <li> It does work, but I have very thin short hair style, If you had heavy long  hair, not sure how it would do, because it does fill up quickly.  when we were finished cutting my hair we had hair clippings everywhere, more  than with a regular hair clipper and lots of fine clippings stuck to hair to   wash out. over all for me though very happy with results.</li>
    <li> I used this trimmer a few times and when it works it does a nice job.    So far i have used it 6 times and today it died on me. Even though fully charged it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore - forget that thing - don&#x27;t buy this trimmer!    Made in China &#x3D; ok  Made in China and Company CEO in the USA &#x3D; not ok</li>
    <li> Love the design, but the item was underpowered from the first use.  The [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut Kit]] is underpowered and hence useless.  Should have listened to The other reviews.</li>
    <li> While the concept sounds great - a supposedly simple way to give yourself a buzz cut, it&#x27;s not what it promises.    While it does work fine (not great) for the sides, back, and top, it&#x27;s impossible to get a good cut around the ears (and before someone says something, I a nice pair of cute itty-bitty ears!).  No matter how you hold it, you cannot get the front if the ear without risking an eyebrow - and even then, it misses the hair in front of the ear, and only trims the eyebrow!    It claims to be a 1/8, 3/16, 1/4 inch groomer, it&#x27;s, in actuality, a 0 (at most 1/32 - pretty much to the skin) (pos #1), a 1/16th (pos #1 1/5 - barely any more length that pos #1), and a 1/4 (pos 2).  What happened to 1/8 and 1/16!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Finally, the balding guard (plastic shield used to adjust length of cut) traps the cut hair in it quickly, so you spend half the time trying to clean it (without cut hair flying all over the place), 1/4 cutting, and the other 1/3 trying (and failing) to finish cutting the hair - you guessed it - in front of the ears!    Definitely the worst $40 spend on a shaver it \\&quot;ears\\&quot;!  Better off spending the $15 on the standard clipper set you&#x27;ll need to finish what this device started.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.  I buzz my head down to the scalp and the lowest setting does this without having to really dig in with the actual blades.  I still own, and like, the Oster clippers that served me well for over 5 years, but the shape of this product, plus that fact that it&#x27;s cordless, just makes is very easy to keep my head cut close.  If you want to go completely bald, you should use shaving cream and a razor, but if you want to keep it tight, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This clipper is a great find! I used to cut my hair using traditional clippers and would have to go over a couple times due to missing some spots. This one, I only had to do one pass-over to get the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the balding brush; however. It did not give me the closeness I wanted. I actually took the attachment off and shaved using the blades directly against my scalp. Worked like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no review for the adjustable attachment though, as I only shave my head as close as I can get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer portion needs a locking mechanism on it. Works great for the sideburns and around the ears, but on the neckline, not so much. The slightest bit of pressure pushes the trimmer in a little bit and causes the blades to stop moving. Therefore you have to hold the trimmer part out while trimming your neck....it&#x27;s not that easy. All and all, it is a great set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that showed cons about the charging time; if you&#x27;re like me it shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem. I use it every 2 days, so it&#x27;s plenty of time to get the charge in otherwise. The length of charging time is no problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is not much more than a pair of traditional clippers as well, so it&#x27;s definitely worth buying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
    <li> This clipper actually works very well.....however, the battery didn&#x27;t make it 1 year using it bi-weekly.  The sad thing is it doesn&#x27;t work plugged in either. Once the battery goes you are finished.      So imagine you are half way through a trim and the battery goes dead. You have a big problem! I know! It happened to me!    It was still under warrentee so I sent it for service 1 month ago....no word back yet!</li>
    <li> A great hair clipper and easy to use when you do it yourself. The cordless rechargeable feature is great and the battery charge lasts for several haircuts. Shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m balding and have had 2 of these clippers over a span of 3 years. My first clippers lasted me two years and I&#x27;d be surprised if my 2nd pair didn&#x27;t last just as long. Great price for a great product. If you have a handheld mirror so you can see the back of your head- it is impossible to give an uneven haircut.</li>
    <li> I decided to pull the trigger on this trimmer and so far, very, very pleased.  I&#x27;m one of those male-pattern baldness guys who only has hair on the sides/back...not the top, and this trimmer has really worked well.  My head appears to have the right (rounded) contour for this device, which has a contour itself. You guys will need to exercise your own judgment on whether or not you have a \\&quot;conforming head\\&quot; :-).  Here are a few tid bits that you may find useful: - if you wear glasses like I do, it&#x27;s still hard to trim around the ears without your \\&quot;eyes\\&quot; on.  What I do is to set the trimmer to one number lower (i.e., 2), fold my ear down, then and trim the sides... and back.  As a DIYer, trimming the back is still difficult, so get a (or borrow your wife&#x27;s) large hand-held mirror, or enlist her help.  I know it sounds weird, but it&#x27;s easier to hear the trimmer cut the hair (i.e., determine whether or not you&#x27;re done, or there&#x27;s more work to do) if you close-off one or both ears (e.g., just place your finger on the ear opening).  You can actually hear (better) the blades trimming the hair, which provides some idea whether or not you&#x27;re making progress.  Although the manufacturer states that you can leave it plugged-in all the time, I don&#x27;t.  I typically use my own judgement to determine when it&#x27;s time for a \\&quot;power-up\\&quot;.  The little trimmer on the device doesn&#x27;t seem to be real effective, but it&#x27;s ok, as I typically use another device for eye brows and side burns.  Again, despite some rather damning reviews about it and the battery, I purchased it and glad I did--it&#x27;s already paid for itself, and then some.</li>
    <li> Has paid for itself already.  Easy to use and the results are consistent. It comes with two comb attachments and mine had the one with the shortest range (all the way to bald).  If you want to have enough hair to brush it into shape, replace the comb with the other one before trying to trim your hair.  At the highest setting, I get just the look I like.</li>
    <li> If you do some research you will see that there are many unhappy folks with this clipper, solely because of battery and/or charger problems.  I emailed Remington customer service and they wrote back that the battery problems have been addressed.  So I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;  If you want a neat short haircut, this device is excellent.  It will not easily cut long hair off, and easily loads up with softer hair even an inch long, but for a weekly short hair cut, it&#x27;s perfect.  The battery arrived with some charge, and filled quickly, as it has after each use.  If the battery does fail, I will amend this review.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m an older guy who has shaved his head for years.  (What remains of my hair is UGLY!)  This is WAY easier.  My routine: I first set the trimmer to as long as the adjustment will go and run it carefully back and forth over my eyebrows getting rid of that shaggy old guy eyebrow junk.  This takes 30 seconds and makes little or no mess in the sink.  Then I step into the shower stall and run the clipper back and forth set on the shortest setting of the adjustable comb.  It takes some repeated strokes, both front to back and from side to side, but no mirror is needed.  It is easy to tell by feel if you have missed anything.  Then I set the clipper out of the shower, turn on the water, and shower.  The short trimmings are no problem for the drain.  This is simple and neat, no mess.  Sorry if I told you more than you wanted to know!!!&lt;br /&gt;  July 10, 2012:  The clipper continues to work perfectly.  I charge it after each use and it stays fully charged until I use it again a week later.  I am REALLY pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;  ONE YEAR later.  Still going strong, just as when it was new.</li>
    <li> I raced to my bathroom mirror to shave my head with this thing.  One might say that I shave my head bald but actually I like to leave stubble.  (I normally use a #000 attachment, which is 1/32 inch.)  I left the shorter comb on and set it to the lowest setting.  Thinking that it wasn&#x27;t going to be short enough with the comb,I actually ended up cutting my hair shorter than I wanted to!  I absolutely love how this gadget feels on my scalp (it&#x27;s like a massage)and I am shocked at how even my haircut turned out.  Shavers like this are destined to break down after a few years.  Therefore, I am ordering another one of these and leaving it in the closet until that day comes.  (Or should I order a couple of them?  I am thinking about it!)  Wow... this thing is amazing!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> I was super excited about this product. I have my hair cut size 3 even all over. I didn&#x27;t want to spend 20$ at super cuts and wait an hour to get it done every 3 weeks. But, this has  been nothing more than a pain in the butt ... really. You have to go over like 100 times for it to even give anything remote to an even cut.   I say just go buy a regular clipper. I bought the Remington clipper with vacuum and have been happy so far. Its fast and sucks out 98% of the hair.     All in all this is nothing more than a fancy idea with little practical use.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked really nicely for my hair for about 6 months. Then it could not hold a charge at all. I can charge it up over night, and it only lasts for about 10 minutes.     I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars only because it worked well for me while it was able to hold a charge.    I would definitely not recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> The [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Cordless Haircut Kit]] is an excellent idea but the product just doesn&#x27;t deliver.  I was really hoping this was going to work for me.  Unfortunately, my experience with this product was mostly negative, and even for a minor trim around the sides I found this product to be poorly designed and without sufficient power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think there are a select few who will be able to use this product.  If you have very fine hair, and tend to keep it between 1/2 inch and 1 inch long all around, this clipper can be a good supplement to normal hair-cuts.  I don&#x27;t think it sufficient to replace normal hair cuts for even this small group of consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thicker or coarser hair that is longer than even 1 inch, this clipper is simply not powerful enough for giving yourself a trim.  Similarly, if you want to trim your hair down to the skin, even at the lowest setting this clipper cuts unevenly.  The problem is the blade angle, which is perpendicular to the scalp unlike a traditional clipper.  Combine that with the slower cutting action likely the result of this unit running off of a rechargeable battery.  The result is that it rarely cuts evenly and requires multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is adjustable by a dial on the inside of the handle that slides the guard farther or closer to the blade as you desire.  There are two guards included, one with plastic tabs that prevent you from dialing this down to the lowest length setting.  That one seems safer, but both guards seem impractical.  Neither of them gives you the option of having longer hair than most Wahl home kits.  I would estimate the longest length with this guard to be the equivalent of the 5 guard included with most home kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair also collects within the guard causing the clipper to get clogged re-cutting hair.  Having to remove this hair required me to remove the guard, slowing me down.  Even just trimming around the sides and back with this clipper was not practical because of the time needed to constantly clean hair out of guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did notice that the battery wore down quickly, I never used it long enough to completely wear it out.  Most cordless rechargeable units have battery issues, so I would be willing to forgive that if not for the lack of power.  Those who keep their hair short all the time and don&#x27;t have thick hair like I do aer likely to be able to perform a quick trim on one charge.  It does seem to take a long time to fully charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were boiler-plate.  I didn&#x27;t see any instructions on how long the battery should be charged and how to extend battery life.  I will have to review the included manual, which has only a few pages of instructions in English and then duplicates them in Spanish and French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do end up getting it anyway, a few uses will be required in order to get the hang of it.  On a positive note, the shape of the unit seems very well designed for comfortable operation.  I will only add that you should make sure the blade is well oiled before use and that the unit is fully charged, as mine arrived with the battery drained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with fine hair that is short to begin with, this can be a useful tool if used once a week so that the hair never gets too long.  For most people, the lack of power combined with design issues makes this product impractical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.because of the time needed to constantly clean hair out of guard.

    <li> This is a great gadget to save cash, gasoline and time. It is however just for guys who like short hair. I find that the #2 setting is close but not too close for me. It leaves my hair about a quarter inch long. If you have a short flat top or just a short hair cut then it makes sense to migrate to this product. Don&#x27;t misunderstand, you can&#x27;t cut a flat top with it but if you are already wearing a close flat top (like I was) then you won&#x27;t see much difference anyway. It does make a little mess with the falling hair clippings. My remedy for that is to just stand in my shower and use it once a week for about a minute and then turn on the water and take my usual shower. I&#x27;m happy to say I don&#x27;t endure the beating of the barber shop anymore. [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut Kit]]</li>
    <li> This clipper did a very poor job trimming my hair.  The cut was very uneven, and after charging the battery for 24 hours, it only lasted about 5 minutes both times I tried it.</li>
    <li> TThis is the second one I have bought. The first on e lasted two and a half years. It works well. I have been unable to find another clipper that cuts evenly.</li>
    <li> So, I purchased this product seeing all of the positive 4 and 5 star reviews thinking that this would be a great product, but  my experience was far from it.  I charged the product as directed for the recommended 16 hours right out of the box and during my first haircut the clippers died within fifteen minutes of trimming.  I had to finish my haircut the next morning!  Thank goodness for hats!  I tried one more time to cut my hair only to have the clippers die on me; this time within five minutes of trimming.  That&#x27;s just unacceptable!</li>
    <li> I think the cause of my problem&#x27;s, is I don&#x27;t know when it needs to  be charge.  The charging light doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  But, it works  well after a 24 hour charge.  You have to keep the blade clean of  hair and the curved blade is easy on the hair.  I think my trouble  is due to ignorance, rather than malfunction.</li>
    <li> Much easier than the old clippers I got used to using since I was in the service.</li>
    <li> OMG!! I LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;I just received it yesterday &amp; I let it charge all night. Today I tackled my 3year old with it. It is always a battle to get him to the barber &amp; its even worse when he is actually getting his hair cut! I was able to hold him still to brush it over his head, then when he had enough I let him go &amp; got him an hour later. It cut his hair perfectly! He was laughing towards the end.. I even asked him if he wanted to use it himself, he said no but I wasn&#x27;t worried about him \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; his own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS is IDIOT proof! I am so glad that I don&#x27;t have to go through the hassle of taking him somewhere to get a hair cut anymore! This is going to save me so much time &amp; $$$$</li>
    <li> This rechargeable clipper by Remington is a great idea, and works well once you get the hang of it. The design is unique and has some excellent features. The cutting area and guards are curved to better fit the shape of your head. It is also a wider cutting area than traditional clippers so you can cut your hair much quicker. It is comfortable in your hand and comes with 2 guards that fit over the blades. Additionally, the blades can be raised higher or lower by turning a dial on the body of the clipper. So there is quite a bit of hair length adjustment possible. The cordless aspect of this clipper is especially nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions aren&#x27;t especially helpful and I think their claim that it&#x27;s fool-proof is a bit overstated. There is definitely a learning curve before you achieve excellent results every time. (I wouldn&#x27;t use this for the first time the day before your wedding or something.) As suggested, you should start with a much longer setting that you actually want while you are learning. You can always make it shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved shape is actually pretty good, but there are places on most heads that are not curved, especially around and behind the ears. That&#x27;s where it&#x27;s tricky and takes practice, but an even cut can be achieved. The pop-up trimmer is very nice and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned by others, you can leave it plugged in between uses and you should. The charger does not work as an a/c adapter so you cannot use the clipper while it is plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been several comments about these units breaking quickly. After a few months, mine began to have issues with not turning on. I think the switch design must be poor because after juggling and whacking my unit, I have always been able to get it to turn on (eventually). Of course, I am expecting that one day, it won&#x27;t power on anymore.</li>
    <li> It just died on me after three years of minimal use. The charge now lasts about fifteen seconds. When it worked it worked ok. Am disappointed in its longevity.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to cut my hair since I bought it (I have short, balding hair that I wear in a brush cut). It worked great but just died after three and a half years--I think the battery is shot. Other than that, it was great.</li>
    <li> It takes a few minutes to get used to using it, so on the first try set the clipper at a higher setting. I really like the hair cut that I get from the Remington Short Cut Clipper! A second advantage is that it is much cheeper than going to a barber!!! I wish I would have had one long ago. I believe you will like this one.</li>
    <li> Update 4-11-10 If I could give this product negative 5 I would!!!    It died again after plugging it in and the blue light went out indicating that it was fully charged. I began to shave my head and guess what? Yup, you guessed it. The red light came on and the blades stopped moving. I threw it in the trash and will never buy another Remington product in my life. CHEAP POS!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so disgusted with this thing I could scream. To emphasize my 10 yr old plus Wahl clippers still work to this day!! If you buy this product after reading ALL the bad reviews, that is your fault! Shame on Remington for selling such a worthless piece of CRAP@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Update 11-21-09 I was suprised to find that Remington was willing to warranty this product without a receipt. They asked me for the date code under the sliding sideburn trimmer. They sent out a replacement at no charge. However, the replacement worked for about 2 months and then it seemingly died as well. I was amazed that a forceful tap into my palm to jostle the internal parts actually brought it back to life. One of those one in a million things. It has worked since and I guess I will continue to use it until it dies again. This is obviously a trouble prone product. It also takes very very long to charge. Sometimes over 24 hrs. Good customer service from Remington but not a very good product.    First I will say I have been trimming my own hair for the last 15 yrs. I have been very happy with this product until it recently went from working just fine to not taking a charge at all!! The battery just died with no warning. I have only had mine for about a year. This is completely unacceptable since my corded/battery operated Wahl trimmer which is over 10 yrs old will still take a charge with the original battery. Of course I can&#x27;t find the receipt, so in the trash it goes. I DON&#x27;T TRUST THE FOUR YEAR WARRANTY STATEMENT! I dug outmy owners manual and it says two years. Maybe they have upped the warranty since a year ago, but I don&#x27;t buy it! I used mine to bald my head, but after reading all the other reviews, it makes sense to me that anyone with the desire to maintain some hair length will not like this clipper. The problem is that there would be no way to accurately keep the clipper the same distance from your head even with the attachment on. This is a very long, curved blade and when you are trimming flat spots on your head you are much closer on the ends of the blade than you are on the middle. Try it at your own risk if you want bald. Stay away if you want to maintain some length. I will go back to using my old trusty!!</li>
    <li> The Remington Shortcut would be a fantastic product....if only it consistently worked! The first one I purchased worked well for about 10 months, then it would no longer charge. And  it only works from battery power - it doesn&#x27;t work with the AC adapter/charger plugged in.  The folks at Remington sent me a free replacement. This one would not hold a charge from the get go. I would start using it, and within about 20 seconds (no exaggeration) the red low charge light would start flashing and it would die.   So I gave up on it. Then, about a month ago, I bought another one, thinking that Remington must have fixed the charging problem by now. Sure enough,  it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge either - give it about 20 seconds and it dies.  Memo to Remington: Fix the defective charging problem or take it off the market!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for the past year. Purchased a second Remington Short Cut Clipper to keep on hand just in case the one he has been using for a year now would die out. Excellent product, precise hair cut, and saved Approx. two hundred dollars by him not going for hair cuts every two weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for $30 from a local retailer.  It comes with a piece that allows you to cut 1, 1 1/2, 2, 3, and 4 cuts.  Another piece will do \\&quot;balding-cuts\\&quot;; in other words, to cut your hair to the point where it is almost bald but you still have a little stubble left.  I have cut my brother&#x27;s toady and my hair two weeks ago with it so far.  Here my impressions.    First off, compared to your standard Wahl clippers, these make a mess.  As others have indicated, the blades chop your hair into thousands of fine pieces.  For clean-up&#x27;s sake, this is a pain, especially if you are cutting someone&#x27;s hair in your home.    My brother&#x27;s hair, when I cut it, is around a 2-inch length.  I used a 1- 1/2 on his hair.  I took two passes over his hair and the razor got clogged with hair, impeding the blades from doing their job.  I had to take the plastic piece off, dump the hair that was impeding the blades, and put the plastic piece on again.  I probably did this 12 times when cutting his hair.  While this wasn&#x27;t a huge pain, be aware of this fact: this razor is best-suited for cutting hair that is short and maintaining its short length.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I don&#x27;t really like the bother of getting haircuts.  I work very long hours as I&#x27;m the sole support for my family and I usually wait until I \\&quot;have to go\\&quot; and then I usually find one of those store front places like \\&quot;Supercuts\\&quot; or \\&quot;Fantastic Sam&#x27;s.\\&quot;  The cuts from those places vary from pretty good to not so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In addition, I have been going bald for the last 20 years and now I only have a little tuft of hair up front and I finally decided that I had had enough and I asked the stylist to \\&quot;buzz all my hair off.\\&quot;  When she had finished I was surprised at how much I liked the look and how easy it seamed to cut it (it took her about 2 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that week I went to Walmart and found the Remington and I have to say that it is a cleaver product that works well.  It is small and lightweight and cordless.  It basically looks like a brush.  It is strictly designed for short hair cuts but it does those cuts well and you can adjust your hair length by turning a little thumb wheel on the clipper.  In addition, it has a push out trimmer that also works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can actually cut your hair without a mirror and I tend to go into the tub to cut my hair and then take a shower to wash all the loose hairs down the drain when I&#x27;m done (the clipper in not waterproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is a small unit it doesn&#x27;t have the power to cut through long hair.  When my son wanted a haircut \\&quot;like dads,\\&quot; I first had to cut his hair down to size with traditional clippers and then I did the rest with the Remington.  Several neighbors commented how nice his hair looked!  In addition you have to occasionally \\&quot;tap out\\&quot; your hair from the cutting mechanism during a cut.  Lastly, the power switch is easy to accidently turn off when you are holding the unit.  All of these \\&quot;complaints\\&quot; are fairly trivial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you have a short \\&quot;buzz cut\\&quot; this device delivers at a reasonable price.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> The innovative design just works so well with trimming the head. I have had excellent results with this clipper. It works well and needs very little maintenance. I have had no problems with charging it - once it runs out of juice, I simply plug it in and after a few hours, it is ready to go. I like the simplicity of choosing hair length with a turn of the knob. I am so glad I bought this product!</li>
    <li> I have been thinking for quite some time to cut my hair real short, to counteract the ongoing thinness on my crown. Finally this Remington Short Clipper made me go for it. At first I was disappointed; inasmuch as my hair was shorter then I was hoping for. If you are looking to get 1/2\\&quot; thick hair, you won&#x27;t get it here. You&#x27;re lucky to get 1/4\\&quot;. Going from long to short, you will need to go to about 1/8\\&quot; first, and then let it grow in a little, and then go for the deepest setting.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a couple of hours and I am starting to like myself with the thin top. With the fuzz on top that is left, I feel like I don&#x27;t always have to wear a hat. This may sound odd, but I am seriously thinking of getting back into working out now. You know treadmill, and weight lifting. With the short hair I feel like I am in the service or something. It does give me a feeling of a desire to start to exercize again.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is convenient because it is cordless. At first I was amazed at how flexible it is in terms of how deep of a cut you want to take. There are several settings you can easily change with the thumbwheel. It also comes with the balding safety comb; the one that extends beyond the teeth so your skin does not come into contact with the moving blades. You&#x27;ll need to finish up around your ears with a pair of scissors if you are going for extra neat.&lt;br /&gt;I did my entire head. If you keep going back and forth, causing the hair to stand up, it gets it all one length. This is not like the old barber shears that will bald you in a single pass. The hair gets caught in the safety comb, and with a light tap, or quickly pulling the long hairs out by hand it clears it for another pass.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this will be great for keeping a beard close for the winter. I used it on my moustache, and it doesn&#x27;t do a very even job of it. I prefer scissors for my muzzy. :-)&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I am glad that I have it. For the price it is a great unit. Just wish they had a medium length unit.</li>
    <li> Product is very simple to use. Glad I saw an arcticle in the local newspaper about it. This led me to Amazon Which had the lowest price. I would recommend this to anyone with short hair.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. As a follicly challenged individual, I&#x27;ve been getting my hair cut at home for several years. Since the spouse doesn&#x27;t like the way it looks when I do it myself (with a standard home trimmer), she insists on doing it. I thought that this new gizmo might be foolproof enough that I could accomplish this grooming task myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was not to be. I made a bigger mess of my scalp than I ever have with standard clippers. I keep my hair very short (I was using the \\&quot;1\\&quot; setting), and it made me look like an old mutt with bald patches in the middle of sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works better at longer settings, but keep your expectations low.</li>
    <li> You want a buzz or you want it bald?  Those are your options with the Remington Short Cut Clipper.  If that&#x27;s what you want it works just fine, but be aware that this is for very short cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing fits nicely in the hand and can be used on oneself.  Even on the bald setting there is a guard that keeps you from cutting yourself, which is a very nice feature.  It comes with two combs, one for bald and one for buzzes of up to half an inch.  The length setting is simple to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After charging up it lasts quite a while.  My only complaint is that there is no case to store the extra comb, or to carry the whole device and its charger plug.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair fairly short, so when I saw this product I figured it was worth a try. My first impressions were good, the packaging was easy to open, and the trimmer felt light and comfortable in my hand. The product comes with 2 combing guides, a cleaning brush, some oil for the blades, a charger, and an instruction manual (which was a bit confusing to read). I was disappointed that the product did not include a case to hold the trimmer and accessories, and that it took a long time to charge fully (16 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After charging it overnight, I attached the adjustable guide comb and set it to the highest setting, which gives a ½ inch cut (be warned that it comes with the balding guide already attached).  I quickly went over my entire head, since the cutting blades work forward and backward. I then used the #3 setting to trim the sides, which gave me a tapered look, similar to the cut my barber gives me. I&#x27;ve used the trimmer twice so far and it&#x27;s already paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is a bit of a nuisance is that the cut hair tends to clog the blades, making it necessary to clean out the loose hair periodically. The unit does come with a sideburn trimmer, but that feature is not very functional. It&#x27;s difficult to get the right angle when using it, so instead I use my Wahl compact trimmer for the sideburns and around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does a good job for its intended purpose. It gives a nice short buzz cut, quickly and easily.  I subtracted one star because of the few shortcomings I mentioned above.</li>
    <li> Dreaming about mean hair cuts? The kind Mark Walhberg gave to his buddy in Three Kings? Or the kind sported by David Beckham or Colin Farrell?&lt;br /&gt;This is your vehicle. A very convenient, very handy device that has been crafted to answer the needs of those who don&#x27;t trust other touching their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system has an easy grip, very comfortable to hold, and is curved to allow easy sliding around the scalp.  User can pick to modify the depth of cutting, from &#x27;extremely low&#x27; to &#x27;slightly more than none&#x27; (although the box says up to 5 settings). It&#x27;s also affordable. The instrument pays itself in just 2 cuts (that is if you don&#x27;t mind this particular hair style and if you currently pay no more than $17 for your hair cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are always in a hurry, hate hairstylists or paying for your haircut, then this is your product. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Got it today turned it on, cut my hair with it. It had the \\&quot;balding comb\\&quot; attached, perfect length. The balding comb cuts at 1/32\\&quot; that info is only written on the side of the balding comb attachment, not on the instructions or box. The red low battery light was on, I still had plenty of power to get the job done. To be fair I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair on top to slow it down. I did have a decent amount of growth where hair still grows. I&#x27;ve used other straight clippers, and to get a product engineered to the curve of the head GENIUS! It was faster and easier. If you need a new clipper and keep your hair super short, then get this. It will probably work fine for the other lengths as it says up to a half inch. I can&#x27;t vouch for that. I can vouch for the \\&quot;balding comb\\&quot; it works great.</li>
    <li> I received my Remington Short Cut Clippers yesterday afternoon and let it charge all evening and throughout the night.  This morning I tried to cut my hair with it.  When it was running, it did quite a fine job...WHEN it was running.  The thing shut off on me half way through a hair cut....lasting only 7 or 8 minutes.  I recharged it and waited the recommended 14-16 hours again to let it charge and when I took it off the charger, I got about 1 second of runtime!  It pulsed and pooped out.  It seems like this would be a great product if it actually ran!  I just put in a call to Remington but they are only open M-F 8am - 4pm...pretty sad customer support hours I think.  I am going to try on Monday and see what happens.  Think twice before you buy!</li>
    <li> These clippers miss a lot of hairs, tends to leave streaks.  I went back to using a Wahl corded clipper imo those work the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for several years.  I&#x27;d just had one bad haircut too many, and was tired of paying $12 for that misery.    Using traditional clippers has always been tricky, switching out the various guards and trying to hold the thing just right.    This brush-style clipper takes all the guess work out of cutting my hair myself.  Especially the hard-to-reach back above the neck.    I&#x27;ve used this unit twice now, and it blends perfectly into the longer hair on top my head.  I have to admit, I have yet to cut the top with these clippers.  Because I really don&#x27;t want it THAT short.    I can use my old traditional clippers on the top, and then trim the back and sides for a month with this Remington clipper.  The job is so much quicker and smoother.    Finally, I can look like I groom myself on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> This is a sorry product! That is all I can say. Can only cut hair 1 time on a charge.   That is not saying much because I don&#x27;t have very much so the clipper does not run but 2-3 minutes. Phillips-Norelco trimmers are FAR superior for not much more money and last for years. I thought I would try something a little different with the Remington but boy was I wrong. I definitely would not purchase this product ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing for 11 months.  I have been cutting my hair very short with it as I am nearly bald on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the reasons that I do not recommend it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. While the curved surface might seem like a great idea, it makes for an uneven cut. Not sure how it works when cutting longer lengths, but when cutting it short I end up with a lot of places that are skinned and others that are darker because the hair is not cut as short there.  It may be fine if your head is perfectly round.  In the dark spots I really have to dig around to get it to not look so bad compared to the skinned spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There really is no warning when the battery is going to run out of a charge.  Be sure to have a backup or else you&#x27;ll have a half-trimmed head.  One second you&#x27;re cutting hair and all seems fine, the next second it just quits.  You think that maybe it is just clogged with hair, but no.  The battery will need a very lengthy charge before you can resume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. This unit cannot be used while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. After 11 months of use, the battery on mine will not hold a charge for over a minute.  Since I cannot use it plugged in, this thing is useless to me and will go in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nifty idea, but I will be replacing this with a new set of standard clippers.</li>
    <li> Unique product, works well.  Two suggestions for improvement:  1. It&#x27;s a hassle having to stop the clipper motor and use a small brush several times during the cut in order to remove accumulated hair.  2. Would like a drop charger.</li>
    <li> This product lasted only one year. It was eventually unchargeable, and would lose its charge after charging up, all by itself. It would die while in use, even when it was supposed to be charged. What a waste!</li>
    <li> I am usually looking for ways to shorten my time needed for a even cut.  I ordered this knowing it will not replace my regular clippers. My hair cut is not an all around buzz which this product is designed for so take it with a grain of salt. I usually fade the sides and leave the top longer. But I usually see stray strands afterward so this was what drove my purchase of this unit.    I gave it 3 stars for following reason and other reviews have mentioned these:  - I can&#x27;t replace the battery when its capacity will go down (all batteries will eventually lose its capacity through dis/recharging cycles so keep this in mind)  - 14 to 16 hour initial charge time is long, but the slow charging of the unit probably to prevent the unit from overheating and prolong the battery&#x27;s life  - the unit will not run with the AC adapter plugged into the unit (so if the power dies on you in the middle of a cut, make sure you have a regular plug in clipper on hand)  - the edge trimmer doesn&#x27;t work, I tend to use my regular clippers to do the edges  - you&#x27;ll still need regular clippers if your hair is longer than 1\\&quot; since the motor is probably not strong enough and angle of the blade isn&#x27;t meant deal with the length/amount of hair    So in my opinion bottom line: use regular clippers for the bulk of the cut, then use the Short Cut to finish.</li>
    <li> I now have two broken units and am very unhappy with this clipper&#x27;s quality.  Both stopped working after only a few weeks of use.  The first just stopped and the second turns on but stops after a few seconds.  Don&#x27;t buy this clipper.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 9 mo. ago.  I got it from another retail outlet because it was out of stock through Amazon.  After about 8 mo. of use the indicator lights for \\&quot;on\\&quot; and \\&quot;charge\\&quot; stopped working.  I had never immersed the cutter or dropped it.  As per the warranty instructions I sent it to Spectrum Brands in WI, the company that provides warranty service for Remington.  The warranty information I received with this clipper said that the product would be repaired or replaced.  After about four weeks I received a check from Spectrum for the purchase price of the product.  The sales tax and shipping and handling charge that I paid were not included. This clipper did an adequate cutting job before it started to malfunction.</li>
    <li> It should be noted that I bought this with the intention of using it without any guide comb on for the shortest cut possible (I still reattach a guide to the unit just to protect the blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels VERY natural to hold and because it&#x27;s cordless there&#x27;s no weight at the end to drag it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the greatest factor is how wide it is and how quickly you can go.  You&#x27;ll never go back to traditional clippers again after this.</li>
    <li> The rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t provide enough time to cut your hair in one sitting.  Despite the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that a full charge will provide 40 minutes of cutting, I get no more than 10 minutes per charge.  I can&#x27;t comment on how well it cuts, since I&#x27;ve never been able to finish a haircut.  Once the battery dies, you cannot continue using the clipper via the cord, and must wait 14-16 hours for the battery to recharge.    If you can finish a haircut in less than 10 minutes, or don&#x27;t mind cutting the top of your head on day 1, the sides on day 2, and the back on day 3, then you may find this clipper useful.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Advertised battery life: 40 minutes  1st unit: 4 minutes  2nd unit: 2 minutes    Obviously Remington is suffering from some VERY poor quality control, yet they continue to sell these junkers.      The product, and what it brings to the user, is simply a dream come true.  Sadly, the non-replaceable batteries render these units non-functional should you be unlucky enough to get a clunker.  With the first unit, it took me 3 full charges to get through a single trim.  That&#x27;s 48 hours of wearing a hat, because the charge time is set between 12-18 hours.  Needless to say, I returned the first unit, and a replacement was sent to me through Kohl&#x27;s.  I acquired another Shortcut, and it was even worse!!  Do NOT take a chance on this unit!  It seems like people are having a 50/50 liklihood of getting a good unit, and those aren&#x27;t good odds.  2/2 junkers for me, and that&#x27;s enough to guarantee I NEVER purchase another Remington product.    It&#x27;s simply disgusting that Remington can turn such an amazing all-in-one device into a consumer headache just because they went with a bad battery supplier.  They chose not to make the battery replaceable (AA would have been nice)--so the responsibility falls on them to ensure that the unit is properly powered for years to come.  Shame on you Remington--you have lost a customer for years to come.</li>
    <li> Completely meets my expectations so much so that I ordered a second hair cliipper.</li>
    <li> i HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS HAIR CLIPPER.  IT IS EASY TO USE AND DOES A GREAT JOB.</li>
    <li> As for the product, I love it...but what good is it if I can&#x27;t use it.  The rechargeable batteries in them are just straight up JUNK!!  Expect to get only a couple of months use out of it.    I thought I got a bad one, so I made the mistake of buying another one.  Now this one is the same way after a couple of months of use.    First your LED charging light will quit working, then your battery life will start to decline.  After a month or so, you can literally charge it overnight and still not get enough charge in it to finish a good cut.  Happened exactly the same way with BOTH of the ones I bought.    I would buy another one in a heartbeat if they fix the battery problem, until then I cannot recommend this product or give it over one star (would give it a zero if I could).</li>
    <li> I love this device.  I havent been to the barber shop in weeks.  I can cut my hair at my own leisure.  It gives you the perfect cut.  I recommend for anyone with short hair, its perfect all you do is set the length and go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll agree with the others who complained about the battery life.  I&#x27;ve had this now for 8 months.  It certainly never held the advertised 40 minute charge.  Now, it can barely go 2 or 3 minutes.  I gave it 2 stars because I liked the job that it did cutting my thinning hair when I first got it.  However, until they fix the battery problem, it quickly becomes unusable and for that it deserves only one star.</li>
    <li> Re: my review below.  Although customer service told me the product had been discontinued, and that I would receive cash back - in fact they sent me another clipper, which to date is working great.  The power output to the motor is much better than my first clipper, and it cuts well.   Based on current experience, I would recommend it.     \\&quot;I bought the clippers at the end of September, and when they work, they work fine.  However, they never seemed to run at full speed.  Note a number of other reviews that noted poor battery power.  About 2 weeks ago they quit entirely - would not run, and would not charge.  I e mailed Remington customer service and they responded quickly and told me to call their phone number 800 736 4648.   The service agent asked for the model number, and said that the clippers had been discontinued by Remington 18 months ago.  She said I could send the clippers to them, and I would be refunded the full purchase price.  She commented, \\&quot;If I send you another one, it won&#x27;t work well either, all the batteries are old (because they stopped manufacturing so long ago).\\&quot;  Advice:  Don&#x27;t bother to buy one - it will quit.  Too bad they stopped production, because as I said, when it ran, it worked great.  I have purchased a set of Oster clippers since (also from Amazon) and they work great!  \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I purchased this short cut clipper from Remington on 15th June 2009.  I felt obliged to write a review .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motivation To buy : I have thick hair and an indian hair cut in normal salon in america was not comming out decent in normal price range of 10$ per hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;1. Allows you to maintain always Fresh Haircut.&lt;br /&gt;2. No need to comb or maintain your hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. No need to spend money on haircut. ( i have saved 20 x 10 &#x3D; 200$( hair cut charges) - 30$ ( cost ) &#x3D; 170$ in 16 months )&lt;br /&gt;4. you can get professional looking haircut with no expertise by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;1. The battery must be fully charged before you start cutting hair to ensure it doesnt stop in middle. That will be a major embrassment. Fortunately i never had to go such embrassment. I always charged it fully for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;2. Long time to charge ie 2 days. but then who cares. just plan a bit and put in on charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Finally a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t cut my noggin!      I prefer my hair to be a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and this nifty clipper really works well for my needs.  I also use it to trim my beard, and set the trimmer length a few clicks higher.    I have read about some battery issues, but I made sure I gave the NiCads full charge before I used it and I keep it plugged in to reduce leakage.     -cheers</li>
    <li> I have had mine for about three years.I am quite happy with my unit.The only facet I am not pleased with is the battery life.For the last year the battery will only keep a charge for a minute or two.Don&#x27;t know if  will buy another or not.</li>
    <li> I often cut my husband&#x27;s hair and therefore are almost always covered in tiny needlelike hairs afterward. With this product, my husband can cut 99% of his hair himself and I only have to tidy up his neck and around his ears...saves me an outfit on haircut day and some extra time! A great product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product when it works. It was my second Remington Short Cut Clipper I purchased. The first worked for about 1.5 years before the battery gave up. The second one had a bad battery right from the start, giving you just one cut for every 12 hours of charging. I shipped the unit back to Remington for warranty replacement or repair and over two weeks later, still no sign of a replacement. Customer service appears not to be a Remington strong point. Hey Remington, \\&quot;Short Cut Clipper\\&quot; users usually don&#x27;t have three to four weeks between cuts to wait for your warranty response!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product nearly a year ago and after having to exchange several times at Target store due to receiving defective units.   I have previously been pleased with Remington products I&#x27;ve purchased - this is the first I have found to be nearly useless. My hair length is typically less than 1 inch and I merely want a closer \\&quot;buzz cut\\&quot; and this device is not up to the task. It repeatedly stops even though fully charged and is flawed in several other ways. I have had 3 or 4 and have had the same problems with each unit, one that appears to be common with many other users. The unit has battery charging problems, \\&quot;on\\&quot; button problems, and cutting performance problems. I regrettably put my old device in a drawer and have purchased a competitor&#x27;s product (Conair HG300 CleanHead) that works as advertised AND does what this product cannot do.</li>
    <li> I bought this captivated by the idea that you can clip your own hair.  Unfortunately, it leaves bald patches. Looked online for any videos to show whether we were clipping wrong, couldn&#x27;t find any.  On the bright side, Customer Service was nice enough to tell me they will replace it.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed a full head of hair for the first two and a half decades of my like.  Now four decades later the battle is almost lost, the comb over no longer hides the scalp.  My first outing with the razor was not problem free.  I attempted what was not beyond the clippers ability but certainly mine.  I suggest sticking with one setting. I attempted two the first time.  The clipper never looses power during the hair cut.  I love this machine and am now almost comfortable looking at the face that stares back at me.</li>
    <li> This is the worst clipper I have ever owned and I have been cutting my own hair for years. It takes almost the whole day to charge it and you can&#x27;t use the clipper when it is plugged. It&#x27;s extremely weak; although I don&#x27;t have much hair left it takes forever to clean my head. Although design looks attractive, it&#x27;s tough to cut the hair around ears. Please don&#x27;t be fooled by the four stars rating, this is a piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I have to run this through my hair over and over and over and over and over and over again.  I keep my hair less than an inch long and this product takes an hour (if the battery holds out) to cut it.  The shape is an appealing concept, but it simply doesn&#x27;t work.  It does work OK on my beard which I keep less than 1/4\\&quot; long.  I would not buy another.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers seven months ago, and for quite a while I told all my friends how much I loved them. The curve worked wonderfully for my head, the guard gave an incredibly short cut, and I was a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, after about six months, the battery starts dying. You&#x27;ll discover this the hard way when you&#x27;re halfway through a haircut and it just turns itself off, over and over again. (And unfortunately, having half a haircut is a style that seems to be failing to catch on.) And as you start looking around online, you&#x27;ll see (both here and elsewhere) that you&#x27;re not alone in this problem; it&#x27;s a defect in the entire line, not just your set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So understand that there are some rave reviews here; heck, I&#x27;d have written one myself in the first three months. But understand that sooner or later it will die on you, with very little warning. So here&#x27;s what you need to ask yourself: is it worth buying a set of clippers that you know will cease functioning in about six months?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Curved clipper makes it simple and easy to keep my head evenly trimmed.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, works great with no issues. I plug it in the night before to use the next day, holds the charge for quite a while. I charged it 2 weeks prior and was able to use it as normal without it dying or showing signs of dying. I have not let it sit longer then the two weeks because I use it. I also use it to shave my face before I shave, works good and saves on buying razor blades too. I use it to trim my mustache/g-tee and it works really good for that also.</li>
    <li> After owning this for 6+ months, I can agree with many of the other negative posters about this product.  It&#x27;s a great idea, allowing you to trim a large swath of hair at once, but the battery is crap and can&#x27;t be replaced.  It has completely died after 6 months and before it did, the charge times were ridiculous.  What is worse, it can&#x27;t be used while plugged in, so this is now in the trash.</li>
    <li> great; quite a money saver!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple of times, but so far it seems to be foolproof. You can use it to cut your own hair like you are using a brush. The pop-out trimmer works fine also.</li>
    <li> Love it! It works best when you run sink water to clean it it seems to lubricate the cutting teeth.</li>
    <li> Two years happy owner!</li>
    <li> I just received this product 2 days ago and then I charged it at least 24 hours before using it.  The manual instruction is very short to the point.  I tried it this morning and it worked perfectly.  I have a medium dense hair and I have my hairstylist cut my side and back with #2 clipper and hand cut on the top.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I tried this with the highest setting #4, it just worked the way I wanted.  Normally, I have to get a haircut once every 3 weeks and spent at least $20 for a 5 to 10 minutes of haircut.  Now, I am projecting to save at least $350 annually :-)&lt;br /&gt;It is very fun to use, and I don&#x27;t want to have a bald cut look; otherwise, I could use my electric razor.  It worked better than I thought!  My hair doesn&#x27;t look like I just out of salon, so I can use it more frequently (let&#x27;s say at least once a week).</li>
    <li> Works fine for a while, but the battery performance is terrible.  It will not operate when charging so you are out of luck if the battery goes dead - and it will go dead really quickly.  I have charged it completely and left it for a few days only to come back to a nearly dead battery.  Edit - So I would love to find another product that works like this one.  This shaver works well but the battery dies quickly and you can&#x27;t replace it.  Buy it but know you&#x27;ll have to replace it within a year or so.  Additionally, the clipper height adjustment wheel is placed stupidly and can easily be moved accidentally during cutting - leaving you with some pretty hideous divots in a hair cut.  Terrible product.</li>
    <li> This thing worked ok, not great, just ok. It doesn&#x27;t cut longer hair very well. If I&#x27;ve got a couple of inches of hair and want to cut to the highest setting (#4) it has alot of trouble. I&#x27;ve got to trim my hair down with scissors before it will cut the hair to the length I want. If you keep your hair very short and use this every couple weeks or once a month it works fine. The big drawback is the fact this this dumb thing refuses to charge after a very short time of owning it, within 3 months. I ordered a replacement and received one without hassle. Now a few months later and maybe 10 or 12 uses later the stupid thing won&#x27;t take a charge again. I&#x27;ve tried it in multiple electrical outlets throughout my home. I can only come to the conclusion that this thing is made very cheaply and not built to last. The concept is nice but the implementation just doesn&#x27;t live up. Look elsewhere for something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: When calling the customer service number (6/1/10) about returning this product I was informed by the rep that this product has been discontinued. You can&#x27;t make any money on a product that your customers are constantly returning.</li>
    <li> This is so far the best hair cutter that I have! I give it 5 starts because of its ease  use and durable and the price. I had the flobbee that I bought  last year. It only last 1 year and the blades are dull. When I cut my hair &amp; my sons&#x27; hair, somehow the blades got stuck and its painful for my 2 sons.     This new remington is NOT painful at all. In fact it cuts evenly from all angle. I would recommend any guy to try this out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 10 years, and decided to get this instead of hanging on to a full clipper set.  It is nice and easy to use, but I find that I have to run it through my hair over and over for it to cut it properly.  In addition, I have to be constantly cleaning out the hair.    I believe this was meant to be used on a more regular basis.  I cut my hair once every two months or so, not that it gets that long but I think this may be why it doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.    Just over a year later, it stopped holding a charge for more than a few minutes.  This was a bad surprise for me when I was in the middle of cutting my hair and it stopped.  It won&#x27;t work while plugged in either, so I had to plug it in for a bit, then cut some more, then plug in again, etc.    If you cut your hair on a regular basis (every week or more), this would probably work better for you than it did for me.</li>
    <li> this is easy to use.  i can shave my head in about five minutes.  easy to hold, easy to reach the back of the head evenly.</li>
    <li> UPDATE -- Been a year, still going strong  Bought this about a month ago, buzzzzzzzz my head several times a month, WORKS GREAT!!!! I have another clipper that I have been using for several years (about 10 now) that has been great as well, BUT needed something else and I am worried about battery life for my older clipper and concern that the new version of the older unit was not made as good as the older. (reviews not so good now for the older unit)  So far this has been really good, I like the ease of cutting (buzzzzzzzzing) my head with the curved feature. Work as designed.  Keep watching as I will update from time to time.  Jim</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  Read the NEGATIVE reviews as well as the shills.  Used this only once, and then it refused to hold a charge for more than 20 seconds, even after sitting on the charger for more than 48 hours!  Also VERY easy to make a mistake and gouge big chunks in your hair, leaving you with embarassing bald spots.  JUNK. RIPOFF. AVOID.</li>
    <li> I bought these after seeing an ad on TV and some reviews online.  I am an American Soldier and hate spending 10-15 bucks a week for haircuts, when all that is being done is shaving it all off.    So, I bought these clippers.  Initially I liked them....you kinda had to go back over some areas, and they don&#x27;t fit in and around the ears where your head isn&#x27;t really round, but they worked.  It took over 12 hours for the battery to charge, and by the time I was done shaving my head it needed to be charged again.    Then after just a few months, while I was deployed, the things just quit working.  They don&#x27;t charge, and will only turn on for short periods of time.  The real sucky part is that they cut out on me half way thru my haircut.....so half of my head was shaved and the other half wasn&#x27;t.  Imagine the looks I got as I walked over to the barber shop!!!    Spend another $15....buy something that has a decent warranty and will actually cut your hair.  (Yeah, Remington claims that my clippers were manufactured more than two years ago and are out of warranty!!)  But stay away from this discontinued fad!!!</li>
    <li> The actual shaver works perfectly for me, I can get a quick trim before class or work in the mornings without too much fuss.  The problem is in the electronic components; the battery is faulty and charge times gradually increase until the unit refuses to charge.  This is a known issue that Remington has not corrected in the product.  Also, the way the product is engineered does not allow you to directly plug the unit in the wall and use wall power to power the shaver like many Braun facial hair shavers do, so when the battery fails, the entire unit fails entirely.  Mine failed after about a year of usage, I&#x27;ve heard others fail much earlier.  Wait until Remington fixes this issue before purchasing one of these, or ignore the product completely.  It will just break on you anyway.</li>
    <li> Cuts my hair well (although it makes a big mess!) The slide-out trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well, but I have other trimmers for that.</li>
    <li> I must say I have bought a lot of clipper sets in my day and since its so dang hot here in Las Vegas this summer I decided to go with a short buzz cut. I used regular clippers but could never duplicate the results of my barber and I felt ripped off by the barber paying him $12.00 for a 5 minute hair cut. So one day I stumbled across these clippers and I am VERY pleased with them. They are perfect for short \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; cuts probably not so good for longer styles. As far as the batter life I have had ZERO problems with mine. I even cut my hair with them right out of the box without charging them. So far I used them 3 times and have only charged the thing once. This clipper is a great buy!</li>
    <li> The Remington Short Cut is a great idea but after five uses won&#x27;t take a charge. All I can do is throw it away. What a waste of money. Now I&#x27;ll go out and buy a real hair clipper. While it worked, it was great , did a good job with a little help from my wife. I had Remington shavers for years and they were well made in the U.S. Now its all Chineese junk.</li>
    <li> The Concept behind the Remington Short Cut Clipper was Great, However it is obviously very cheap in Craftsmanship.After not to long of a time the Charging seem&#x27;s to be not working, No Green light,etc,Just a red one when I turn it on.Remington,being a long standing household name,Should be Ashamed to have Put Out such an Inferior Product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I bought the Short Cut, apprehensive as hell the first time I took it to my head. No more. This thing is amazing! I used setting 3 on already short hair from a barbershop visit (my last, I think) 2 1/2 weeks ago. In 2-3 minutes, my hair looked exactly as it did when I last left the barber&#x27;s chair: Really short, cleanly cut, even all over.    Simple. Flawless. Even (dare I say?) FUN. I ran it slowly and steadily back and forth from front of head and down the back, then back the other direction, then ear to ear over the top, then back the other way, then along each side above the ears. You can use this baby about every 7-10 days (takes all of 2-3 minutes) and keep your hair exactly the length you want in perpetuity with nary the need for another time-consuming barbershop visit. Absolutely amazing. Now I&#x27;m thinking about going to a 2 and see what happens. I used setting 1 to trim the lower regions of my neck in the back and this seems to have worked well.     It seems that many of the gripes in this review section are from people who tried with little success to cut through long hair with it. The SC just is not designed for this. What it IS designed to do is keep already short hair short, or shorter.    What I did, and would suggest, is to visit the barber one more time and get your hair cut as short as you want, then when it just starts to get too long, go over it with the SC.    But, jeez, I just don&#x27;t see how anyone can screw it up.     Update, 8/1: I found that the best way to get a quick, even cut is to wash your hair, let it dry completely (about 3 minutes with super short hair), THEN use the short cut. This way your hair is straight up all over and doesn&#x27;t have a chance to get flattened anywhere on your head. Also, just spread a sheet of newspaper over the wash basin; this catches almost all the hair. Just fold it up and toss when you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;ve also done my cutting over the wash basin itself which seems to catch just about all the clippings. Then you just take a folded piece of toilet tissue, wet it lightly and scour the inside of the bowl. You get about 90% on the first pass, then use a dry sheet to clean up the rest. I&#x27;m really surprised at the some of the problems reported in the negative reviews. The whole process is about as simple and efficient as is realistically and reasonably possible.</li>
    <li> I received the Remington Short Cut Clipper on 10/31.  Gave myself a haircut the same day.  Looks great.  Works as advertised.  I will buy a second set.  Even if I experience the charging problems other reviewers have noted, it&#x27;s still a great value.  Each time I use it I save $20 so the next time I will have recouped my investment.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the one I bought last year (at twice the price back then!).  I wish the product was built to last longer, but it seems true that most units will die of a bad battery within a year. If it had the option to run with the power cord I would have been content with that just to get more use out of it but it will not function while plugged in. Having said that, if it did not allow me to cut my own hair and save $15-$20 each time I use it (once a week) I would be angry at the short life span. But it does such a great job and allows me the freedom and ability to cut my own hair without looking like a clown afterward that I can&#x27;t be too angry. I feel I&#x27;ve gotten my money&#x27;s worth out of it even in the short time it worked for me. I just wish companies took more pride in their products and built them to last. If another company had something like this I would definitely give them a try, hoping for better battery life. Other than that the unit is sturdy and easy to use and the results are reliable. Had the battery not been an issue I would gladly give this 5++ stars.</li>
    <li> Perfect?  Not quite.  But it&#x27;s the best consumer use curved clipper engineered for buzz cut today.  I used to pay my barber $10 + $3 (tips) to shave my head, which is not a lot, but the in-between looks annoyed me to no end.  Now with this Shortcut Clipper, I can touch-up as frequent as I need to (usually weekly).  This is a Godsend for me.</li>
    <li> This item was good at the start.  However, as time went along I could hear a little rattle inside the razor.  Almost like something broke inside.  Shortly after, the thing just stopped working.  Nothing to do with the battery.  The concept was good, but they didn&#x27;t take it as far as they should have.  It doesn&#x27;t work good on the sides of the head.  They very easily could have had a straight blade on the opposite side.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, unless you want to keep buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> This was a great item.  I wished it would have worked while plugged in, I have a beard trimmer that works both on battery and plugged - I prefer while plugged because it seems to operate better/faster.  A trimmer that trims slow is more apt to catching and pulling my hair.  Seemed sort of lacking in power at time.  Less than 9 months old and stopped working.  The blue charge light will no longer come on, but seems to have some power as it starts for about 3 seconds and then stops.  Tried to lube it with the apropriate lubricant but will not work.  Shame, I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I needed a trimmer that would easily cut my hair very short.  The Short Cut Clipper is just perfect for that.  It adjusts easily and I very quickly honed in on what setting I needed.  Great product!</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AS THE RED CHARGE LIGHT DOES NOT WORK AND THE BATTERY DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE LONG AT ALL. I WILL NOT BUY A REMINGTON PRODUCT AGAIN AND WILL CONSIDER ALL MY PURCHASES TO BE AT A STORE SO I CAN RETURN THE ITEM QUICKLY. I COULD NOT COMPLAIN TO AMAZON AS I USED THE CUTTER AND FOUND IT NOT UP TO STANDARDS. IT&#x27;S BETTER TO SHOP IN PERSON.    RAZOR DOES NOT CHARGE AND IS USELESS.    *****BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT ******* WORTHLESS !!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t fault this clipper on very much.  It works well and certainly works better than using a traditional set of clippers and spacers ... especially when using it by yourself.  It does take a great long while to charge (average 12 hours) but once it&#x27;s charged, it lasts quite awhile and according to the manual you can just leave it plugged in if you want.  Since there&#x27;s no outside suction involved, you have to move the unit around on your head pretty vigorously to get an even cut and hair clippings go everywhere, but I just stand in the shower enclosure and then shower afterwards and it really is no problem.  The unit seems to be well made and hasn&#x27;t missed a beat for the last month that I&#x27;ve been using it.  So far it&#x27;s the best solution I&#x27;ve found for cutting your own hair. Just remember that it&#x27;s for folks that keep their hair 5/8\\&quot; or shorter.</li>
    <li> I used this clipper last week. It really does ok but I think it needs to be often, like every week or maybe two. It took some time to cut the way my previous Remmington clipper did.</li>
    <li> Bottom line: I&#x27;ve used mine for 1.5 yrs to maintain my buzz cut with a trim every 2 weeks or so. Just now it seems my power brick died, and I don&#x27;t mind buying another for $25 on Amazon.     One downside that I find quite annoying is that it doesn&#x27;t work at all while plugged in. Why the heck is that? So if you&#x27;re in a pinch and the battery is dead, you can&#x27;t plug it in and use it. You have to wait until it&#x27;s charged.     I was also hoping they&#x27;d have upgraded the model in the past 1.5 yrs, but apparently now.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I first got this. It was easy to use &amp; coming from self clipping with a traditional clipper this was a dream. The two things I noticed right away was that your hair would bunch up in the clipper guide &amp; you have to clear it out every 1-2 strokes. This wasn&#x27;t a problem to me as long as the thing worked.&lt;br /&gt;Very soon after I became hooked on it the battery started to die quickly. So fast that with a full charge I was only able to do half my head. Try explaining that to people.&lt;br /&gt;I returned that one &amp; the second one was decent for a month then just stopped dead. Returned for a third &amp; that one worked for about 7 weeks then something inside came loose &amp; rattled. Again the battery would die quickly &amp; the power of the clippers went down in strength, even when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they would make these with any real materials instead of the cheapest plastics &amp; motors (I opened mine to see what was going on.) The mount for the motors are junk &amp; don&#x27;t hold tight losing power. The plastic the clippers mount into are cheap, weak &amp; made very thin so they break easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the old barber shop style. Oster makes the very best if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
    <li> The idea was great, but even with my husband&#x27;s fine, thin hair it would miss lots of hairs, right in the areas that should have been no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the worst part is, that it is DEAD after only a handful of uses!! Apparently the switch just died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing they would do is refund us if we mail it back to them but the shipping would negate the refund. More so I hate the environmental affect of tossing something after such a short time of use. Wish we could go back to the days when things actually WORKED and lasted for 30 years like our parents/grandparents had.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper cuts great! I will mention though that unless you want a buzz cut (practically bald), you&#x27;ll need to ADJUST the height level on the DIAL on the bottom side of the clipper (side opposite of the power button). I made the mistake of just reading the reviews and went off the one person&#x27;s advice to change the guide if you don&#x27;t want a bald head, so right after I opened it, I immediately swapped the guides, charged it, then went straight to cutting my son&#x27;s hair. BIG MISTAKE. After the damage was already done (front and center-LOL), I had to go ahead and even it all out. When I was almost finished I finally turned it over to blow some hair out of the guide and noticed the dial, which made the guide shift up and down. If I would&#x27;ve adjusted it to begin with, it would&#x27;ve been perfect, but that was my stupidity.    The clippers cut great though. I will not be taking my son back to the barber now that I have this.</li>
    <li> The thing was supposed to come with some initial charge, its not even switching on. I am terribly depressed by this product..:-(..Got a faulty device online..:-/</li>
    <li> If you are largely bald and want a haircut that doesn&#x27;t scream self cut, this is a great clipper. I&#x27;m on my second one. Be careful to lubricate and aware that the battery will fail too soon.</li>
    <li> Very good I buy one every year for my husband.</li>
    <li> Find this product to be great for those close cut haircuts. Previously purchased one that stopped working for some unknown reason. As long as it keeps it&#x27;s charge (and long enough) it is a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> 1. I does what is says it should do, cut short hair, and does it well.  2. It can \\&quot;on the paper\\&quot; be cleaned under water.  3. It works when charged (but that takes it&#x27;s time).    I bought this model in a Remington gift-pack (with a horrible and useless nose/ear clipper).     The first thing I remember was that it seemed to be a low-cost model. It was difficult to connect the charger correctly (had to pull it out and in many times before it started to charge). BTW, it takes over a half a day to charge it. Fully charged it handles about one hair-cut, thats it. After some time, I guess the battery power will be so low that it need in to be connected when used.    It does it&#x27;s job well when you want short hair, period. It&#x27;s long bent form make it easy to shave/cut your hear.    The quality of the product is poor, sorry to say say so. It looks good when you open the box, but after a little time, you find it&#x27;s faults. Examples: Poor connection between the charger connection, the plastic hair accessories breaks easily (the ones you use when you cut your hear, and remove when cleaning). My item also began to take in water after a while, even though it said that the shaving blades could be cleaned under water.    This could been a great/fantastic product, but is clearly made as inexpensively as possibly.</li>
    <li> I just received the product two days ago and finally got a chance to use it.  It worked great!  I cut my hair every two weeks and was going to the barber shop today, but decided to try and use it on the sides.  It was easy to use and I didn&#x27;t screw things up!  I&#x27;m probably still going to have to go the barbershop periodically as I like the flattop look, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to acheive that with this product.  I am going to try and see how I can make it work though, one of these days.</li>
    <li> I was concerned by some reviews that claimed the charger on this was faulty, but decided to buy it anyway because I liked the idea of the curved shape.    When I got it I decided to leave it plugged in all the time to avoid charger problems. And when I used it - for about a month - I did indeed like the shape and the fact that it was cordless.    But when I went out of town my housekeeper unplugged it for a few days. And when i returned and plugged it back in, it was totally dead. Tried a few things to bring it back to life, but alas, had to toss it. After just a month!    Remington should be ashamed to market something with such an obvious flaw. Their name used to stand for quality.</li>
    <li> I like the easy way this hair cutter does its job. My wife says its the best haircut I ever had. I had the Flowbee and Robocut throughout the years to compare it with. What I don&#x27;t like is the batteries are weak. They run down quickly and take a long time to charge. It is easy to maintain and use compare to other cutting system. If you like hair over a half inch this is not for you.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this clipper for about 6 months now ... worked flawlessly. I liked having my hair cut close and all was fine and dandy ... until it died. After reading all the latest reviews from those who have owned it for a bit of time ... I realized that buyers need to aware of the issue that it&#x27;ll die. Sure it&#x27;s cheap and I guess it saves you all the trips to the local barber ... but still, would be nice if they could fix the issue instead of ignoring it.</li>
    <li> Mar 2010: I bought this over a month ago.  Gave myself about 4 or 5 simple haircuts so far.  Sure easier and cheaper to stay neat and trimmed than going to the barber.  Before each haircut, I would plug the clipper in to be charged overnight.  This last time (2 weeks from last haircut), it seemed to have fully charged in about an hour.  I set it at size 1.5 and run it around my head.  This is the easy part.  Then, I would use my hand as a guide to get cleaned up at the lower back side of my head.  As for around the ears, I take out the guide then carefully run is over my hair - taking out a bit at a time until I am happy that it does not touch my ears.  That&#x27;s it!  BTW, I do not have battery problem like other posts.  I am keeping my fingers crossed.    Oh, one thing about using this clipper is that you have to shake loose the hair clipping from the inside.  It&#x27;s not hard.    I did have a regular clipper that I used previously, but I would need someone to help me with cleaning up the back of my neck and the side.  Maybe I am just not that good at it.    Apr 2011: Around the latter part of 2010, I rinsed the clipper under running water.  I probably overdid it since the battery no longer holds strong charge and the blue LED no longer lights up.  A few times, it would seem the battery is running out which could have meant a half done haircut.  I finally got fed up with the battery issue and bought another one today.  It is charging as we speak.  I shall take care of this second one better.    Oh, as a \\&quot;year after\\&quot; review, since I cut my hair weekly with this clipper, I potentially saved $500 in haircuts this past year - not to mention savings in gas (driving) and time (waiting).</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best clippers I&#x27;ve used.  Nice design and makes quick work of the cut...a little awkward around ears, and not so easy to clean...but I love it.</li>
    <li> As a balding guy, this seemed like a perfect tool. Zip, zip, done.    The contoured head works great for the top of one&#x27;s head. And if my head were perfectly round and without ears, I would have been happy with this. While it works great in the top of the head, it does not work well on the sides, and you can forget about trimming hair anywhere near your ears.    I used it maybe 8 times then went back to a traditional hair clipper for two reasons: the ones listed above and because it broke. It stopped taking a charge, and it does not work while plugged in. I called Remington&#x27;s 800 number and was told I could ship it back to be repaired. The cost to do that would have been more than I paid for it. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I would be able to give myself a Marine Corps regulation haircut and save myself hundreds of dollars every year.  I want to point out to others who may be interested in buying these for the same reason: You CANNOT give yourself a fade with these.  They are developed to cut your hair the same length on your entire head.  I gave them to my younger brother, who likes them because that&#x27;s the way he cuts his hair.  For me though, I picked up a cheap pair of Wahls at Walmart.</li>
    <li> This did not work like I was hoping it would.  If your hair is already short, this will not work very well.  At least for me it didn&#x27;t.  I was looking for an easy way to keep my head buzzed as short as possible without using a blade razor.  I tried this product without any success.  The different plastic attachments act like normal clippers, meaning they will come at the hair at 90 degrees, but the cutting blade is vertical.  Try using regular clippers by holding them vertical to your scalp and see the mess it makes.  Same concept as standing your lawn mower up on its end and trying to get the blade to cut the grass.  Well, that is what happens here.  I guess if you have long hair this design will work, but for short clean shaven hair, it does not work.  I returned this product for a full refund.</li>
    <li> Works good while it works but doesn&#x27;t hold up well, this was a replacement for my boyfriend&#x27;s last one and it broke with in months</li>
    <li> I like my hair VERY short. This product makes that easy to do. I used to use Wahl Shavers that took 3X as long &amp; burned after the shave. This product is the best way to keep your hair very short. Easy to clean too!</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 of this item. One for home, and one for travel. Both work great for me. I keep my hair buzzed or very short as in as close to shaved as you can get with a clipper. After a year, both work well and are quick and simple to use. Probably not good for long or bushy hair, but my middle aged receding head looks great with the help of this clipper.</li>
    <li> Very durable, clean cut, reliable and effective.  I am very happy to have these clippers and if it breaks I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The idea and design of this product is commendable however, the power storage on this unit leaves something to be desired.  At first, I thought it was merely the particular item I purchased.  But, when I ordered a second unit, it failed to maintain a decent charge also.  The most frustrating thing about this product is the fact that most shavers or electrical items will allow one to keep the cord plugged in while using it.  However, if you plug in the charging cord the product will not function.  Nevertheless, when the product does work it works well and I continue to use it, I just wish it would stay charged for more than one use and the blades would work at a speed that creates a more comfortable cutting experience.</li>
    <li> rechargable battery failed after about 1 year.  i now have to charge over night before I want to use.  Also, the adjustable plastic hair guide isn&#x27;t strong enough. mine broke on one end so the slightest pressure will cause a deeper cut along one end of the trimmer than on the othe end.  yes, that&#x27;s an uneven cut!  i&#x27;m extra careful and manage, but it&#x27;s a pain in the ass.</li>
    <li> my husband bought this product when it first came out and he loves it. it easy and comfortable to use. this clipper is great for men who are balding and like their hair really short. he has had this for about two and half years and it recently got shorted out by a lightening storm, however we are buying another one because he like it so much. he never had problems with the battery, so im not sure why this had so many bad reviews.</li>
    <li> Other than the fact that I have to figure out a way to cut the hair on my neck evenly this is a pretty good product.I have cut my hair with these clippers 3 times now and I am getting the hang of it. Word of caution: Watch out for the size roller wheel. I accidentally moved it while doing a pass, so I had to make a few more passes to fix it. Just make sure to go slow and make plenty of passes and ask someone to check your work once you think your done at least until you get more confident using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper after reading the reviews here. I have a 12 month old that was in desperate need of a hair cut, but I was afraid to unleash him on any local barber. I knew he wouldn&#x27;t sit still and may be afraid of all the noise and strangers in the shop.&lt;br /&gt;I gave him some snacks and went to town. HIs hair was fairly long and it never got tangled or pulled his hair. It only took about 20 minutes to fully trim his hair. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never cut anyone&#x27;s hair before, but these clippers made it fool proof!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for other users of this clipper, but when I used it for the 3rd time it seemed like the battery was not holding a charge(was cutting VERY slow). All that it needed was a little hair clipper oil(mineral oil) on the blades, and it worked like new again! I think that this is the only real drawback for this clipper. Keep it oiled and it will give you great haircuts time and time again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. Great design to fit the contours of the head. But after only 4 months of use the clipper is not holding a charge. The worse part is that it shuts off in the middle of use, and one ends up with a head with half cut hair. The clipper won&#x27;t work while being charged, i.e., plugged in. That&#x27;s a major error in the product design (particularly when it&#x27;s a weak charge.) Maybe mine is a defective version but this should not have happened. Remington got my money with what looked like a good product with an innovative approach. But after this experience I will never buy anything from Remington again.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Short Cut when it first hit the market about 2 years ago and was happy with it until the battery started having problems and then finally died. Since it only works on battery power it&#x27;s now trash. I contacted Remington to see if the battery could be replaced but no luck.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair &amp;#34;high and tight&amp;#34; and this product allows me to cut my own hair perfectly so I wont have to bother the wife to do it for me any more. If you can comb your hair you can cut it with this rechargeable device. I put mine on &amp;#34;Chemo&amp;#34;........well, almost that close......and it came out even and perfect. LOVE THE THING!!</li>
    <li> Will order from hear again.. Good product for money.</li>
    <li> I never knew this existed, I been getting a haircut every three weeks @$11.00 / $6.99  when I could find coupons now with the Remington Short Cut I can do it myself every week it works great, the first time charging takes about 14 hours, I feel this is the greatest tool ever made for cutting your own hair short.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the hope that it would cut my hair shorter than standard clippers, and with less hassle. It&#x27;s been everything I hoped for.  I find that it&#x27;s relatively fast to get a nice, short haircut, and the fact that it&#x27;s cordless is a big plus. The fact that it&#x27;s curved allows a larger area of your head to be in contact with the clippers. That really speeds things up.  I find that it takes a long time to recharge, several hours, but once you determine that, it isn&#x27;t a problem.  I set the clippers to cut the hair as short as possible, using the balding comb on setting \\&quot;1\\&quot;, and go over it every day to keep it looking sharp. It can be used for over a week without needing to be recharged, even when used every day. I just get into the rhythm of charging it once a week and it&#x27;s never a problem.  The way it holds all the hair clippings makes it a lot cleaner than conventional clippers that make a big mess.  I&#x27;m totally sold on this item, and I&#x27;m glad I stumbled upon it.</li>
    <li> DID NOT CHARGE --- CALLED WARRANTY NUMBER PROVIDED, AND SENT PURCHASE INFO ---- STILL WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN ------- STRICTLY A BUMMER RIGHT NOW!!</li>
    <li> Overall, it is an easy use product. Just like combing your hair, no technique required. But(there always a but), it could only effectively work with the forth hair length setting which is the shortest cut. Plus, the hair around the ears are intact at the end, and it takes forever to get it fully charged.</li>
    <li> Very bad please return my money</li>
    <li> The Good:     The clippers make short work (no pun intended) of getting your hair cut. The curved clippers make it easy to get an even cut on most areas of your head, with the exception of around the ears and the sideburns. In those areas a set of flat clippers would be nicer.   The Bad:    The battery life is terrible. After 6 months I find myself charging it after each use which doesn&#x27;t sound too bad except for the fact it only takes 5 minutes to shave your head. Also, the motor seems to speed up and slow down on its own, which I attribute to the battery. I could live with a bad battery if I could just plug it in and continue to use it while charging but the unit will not function when plugged in, which is just plain annoying.     So all in all, after 6 months, I find myself in the need of a new pair of clippers, which is really not as bad as it sounds as the clippers are very inexpensive and after 2 haircuts/trims they&#x27;ve paid for themselves. It would be nice if the battery lasted a *little* longer though.</li>
    <li> This razor excels at cutting your hair off in uneven clumps while scraping your scalp to the bone! If you want a consistent length of hair, you&#x27;re in luck, provided that length is \\&quot;no hair at all.\\&quot; If you use the guard, then your hair may not get cut at all, or it may just be cut unevenly. As for the shape of the device, I can just say that there&#x27;s a reason razors usually have their clippers in a straight line -- because it works. This shape only ensures that the blades will be some unguessable distance away from your scalp at any given time, adding to the \\&quot;I gave myself a haircut\\&quot; feel that every man dreams of, and every woman wants. To top it off, you have to plan your hairscrape (not so much a hairCUT) a good 4 - 8 hours in advance, since it&#x27;ll only hold its charge for about 2 or 3 days.</li>
    <li> Worked for a couple of years, but the battery ended up not holding a charge.  Ended up just trashing it.  When it worked, it cut the hair evenly and quickly.  You definitely want to take a shower right after as it can leave hair &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; all over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Amazon for a VERY long time, but I&#x27;ve never felt compelled to write a review for a product...until now.  The concept of this cutter is pretty good, but the execution is absolutely terrible.    Since I started balding I&#x27;ve kept my hair cropped pretty close.  When I saw this product I thought, wow this a good way for me to keep my hair neat by myself and not spend about $20/mos. on hair cuts--that&#x27;s $240/year for what is essentially just someone occasionally running a trimmer over my hair.  The product does a pretty decent job, when it&#x27;s working.  It won&#x27;t do the full job--you&#x27;ll need a small trimmer to get around the ears and something more manageable to crop very close around the neck, but with a little patience and a little planning you can get a pretty good close crop.  I normally start with a 3 setting with the normal comb over the entire head and work my way down to the balding comb tapering along the way.  In concept it makes it easy for someone like me to trim their own hair.    Unfortunately, the build quality is terrible.  My second clipper just crapped out.  The first one died after just two cuts (i.e., less than two months)--it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the charging light wouldn&#x27;t light up.  Remington replaced it (I sent it to Remington and never heard anything--after a couple of months I had to call them up and ask them about my clipper and they had no record of my sending it back) and this one lasted about 9 months--figure maybe12-15 cuts, certainly less than 20.  Over time it had more and more difficulty holding a charge when finally it dies almost immediately.  I suspect that this may be a case of battery polarity reversal after it&#x27;s discharged completely.  This is really frustrating, as I really could use a product like this but it is a major hassle and just very poorly executed.  On the Remington site one reviewer claims that the newer SCC-100R that replaced the SCC-100 fixes the problems.  Well...if lasting a mere 20 cuts over lasting 2 cuts is \\&quot;fixed\\&quot;, then I guess it is.  Most people would not consider this a \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; product.    This product is a great concept.  Why can&#x27;t Remington make this product work!?!?!?  I&#x27;d easily spend three or four times as much for a durable quality build product.  Remington, don&#x27;t try to save $1 on build quality.  You&#x27;re frustrating your customers, eating into your profit margins on returns and repairs, and causing significant brand damage.  Please fire the people responsible for ruining this potentially great product.  What sort of company puts this crap out and then keeps shipping it with such obvious problems?  What it says to a consumer is that YOU CAN&#x27;T TRUST Remington.    BTW, why does this product ONLY work off of the terrible rechargeable battery?  If it, at least could operate while plugged in I could get more life out of it.  Perhaps it has something to do with the product being \\&quot;washable\\&quot;--they don&#x27;t want it plugged in while it&#x27;s running under the faucet, I guess.</li>
    <li> Nice little item for cutting your own hair. Very easy to use and seems to do an ok job cutting your hair. Much easier to use than the barber style clippers that I use to use. I have used it twice now and so it has pretty much paid for itself.</li>
    <li> The Remington Short Cut Clipper works well for keeping my hair trimmed. I normally try to take care of this task once every few weeks, but this trimmer makes it easy to do once a week if I decide I want to or need to.</li>
    <li> mine was delivered last night, i charged it for a couple of hours and i experience a wonderful hair. the product is great just as described. cutting my hair hasn&#x27;t been more fun. i strongly recommend it  for those who wants to cut cost without compromising quality.</li>
    <li> Purchased on 12-13-2011 and charged overnight as directed by the product manual. It will not run for more than 1-2 minutes before going dead.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I wanted to give it a try. Problem with conventional cutters, flat head for my round head. Hence to get a close or \\&quot;buzz cut\\&quot; meant going over and over again. My advise, read the reviews carefully. So far its been very helpful. After 3 cuttings, here is what I think of it.&lt;br /&gt;1. Have only charged it once so far, and its still cutting well. Took the advise of some reviews and clean it after each use (just takes a minute) and keep it oiled. Runs like a champ which probably cuts down on the power drain.&lt;br /&gt;2. It works great! Cuts close, even,  without tearing up my head. Wonderful design&lt;br /&gt;3. The quality seems average, but if it lasts 2 years or more, then its worth the $30 for certain. 2 cuts at the shop and its paid for.&lt;br /&gt;I am an rc airplane buff, so familiar with nicads (which is most likely whats used) Let the battery drain all the way and then charge it. Keep it clean and oiled and it will have less drain.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing. The trimmer isnt that good. I have the remington hair nose and moustach trimmer and use it instead to trim around the ears. It works great (and seems to use the same charger) and have had it for a few years.</li>
    <li> I use the hortest setting on the adjustable cutting guide and it works great. It&#x27;s easy to accidentally turn the adjustment wheel which could be a problem if you&#x27;re using a longer setting. I love it though. Just go outside with the rechargable unit and in a few minutes I&#x27;m done. Much easier than a standard clipper</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my unit about three years now and really like it (use it about twice per month).  It&#x27;s paid for itself over many times.  I bought one for my Dad who had battery / charging issues soon after he received it.  With any rechargeable battery(s), you should always keep the batteries in a fully-charged state for longer life.  As soon as I am finished using it, I fully charge it.  Then, when I&#x27;m about to use it, I plug it in to be charged (it usually is already fully charged).  I found that if I leave the charger plugged into it, but not plugged into the wall socket, I lose some charge.    With my \\&quot;lumpy\\&quot; scalp, the shortest settings will leave little \\&quot;patches.\\&quot;    I&#x27;m thinking of buying a \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; unit as I know someday the batteries will age to the point I cannot complete a haircut.</li>
    <li> doesnt work on the flat part of your head and you can not get your neck either and doesnt cut short enough</li>
    <li> Extremely poor battery performance. Won&#x27;t charge and will not operate while connected to mains power. Useless. After 12hrs or charging unit operates for about 20 seconds!!!</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be great when I ordered it but the Short Cut works even better then I expected. I just used it this morning and it took all of 5-10 minutes to completely shave my head. The only complaint that I have is that the blades do need oiling regardless of what the manual says. Only thing that would make this better would be to build in a vacuum so I don&#x27;t make such a mess when I shave. Still a 5 star product and I would buy it again in a second.</li>
    <li> It just don&#x27;t cut hair well.  You have to pass it over an over again and you feel is not cutting anything.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for. After a few months it just stopped charging. I would have been fine using it plugged in but it only works off the charge. Great idea for a product but it should have been built better. I would gladly pay three times the price if someone would build one properly.</li>
    <li> I think this product works best if you like to keep your head at a Zero. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very effective at longer lengths. I bought one for my Dad also who keeps his hair at about a 2 or 3 and it works alright. Above that I think you&#x27;d be disappointed. Keeps it&#x27;s charge for about 3 cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that makes this product work a little better is completely removing the blade guard. Once I did that I got a nice tight cut every time. I shave my head every 5 days and this makes the clippings small enough to wash right down the drain in the shower. After two weeks of using it I no longer need a mirror. The curved design cuts the amount it takes to shave in half, and it feels better in the hand then a pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> The Remington clipper works great when you cut your hair often, do not let it get to long or the clipper will not cut and you will have to increase the length to cut.  If you use it alot you will be OK.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how good this worked and how close it cuts love it works like a brush  so easy to use its ridiculous&lt;br /&gt;great way to maintain short crew cut  or stubble look to the beard</li>
    <li> [[AS IN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut Kit]]  great clipper; good when you don,t have much hair left ,it pays for it self really quickly. I ordered a new one haven&#x27;t got it yet the battery&#x27;s gave out on the old one used it 3 or4 years it  payed for it self   Jim Boogerd</li>
    <li> I am a mother of 4 boys and taking them to get their hair cut is a dent in our budget so I saw these clippers and thought save 80 dollars once a month Had High hopes for this product. I pride myself on how my boys look and having a good haircut is one of those things. This product left a gap in my 4 year old&#x27;s head he had to go bald,granted I thought it was from him moving around. Had to wait a day for it to charge up after one haircut and by the time my 14 year old son was gapped up and in need of a little trim on the sides this product was dead again so now my other two sons have to wait wow all around horrible experience with this clipper and will not be using it again on the lookout for another. Do not waste your money or time on this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Saves you money and a trip to the barber&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Low battery life doesn&#x27;t last a full cut&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t cut even at all no matter how you use it&lt;br /&gt;trimmer is awful all together if the battery last</li>
    <li> It works great. I still need to get regular haircut for around the edges, but this thing does the job..</li>
    <li> I Have had this for well over a year now and it has worked fine.  No problems.</li>
    <li> This item, when it works, is great.  It allows me to cut and/or trim my hair very nicely.  The problem - the battery in my first unit began to weaken after a few months and by 9 months, it was dead.  So, I bought a second unit.  It arrived DOA.  These units are a great idea, but the implementation sucks.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the results of using the Remington Short Cut Clipper. The most important thing you can do is read and understand the instructions before using. Start with the longer cut and work your way down to the shorter range until you find  what works best for you, unless your going for the shaved head. I especially like the curved cutting head as it fits the conture of your head. This helps to eliminate the \\&quot;stepped\\&quot; look you may get with a straight cutting head. It works well in both directions (up &amp; down).</li>
    <li> This item is marvelous for keeping the hair around the ears and back of the neck neat and short.  It&#x27;s not the best for the longer hair on top of the head but can be made to work for that too.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. IT IS THE WORSE ITEM I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. IT FREAKING TAKES 16 HOURS TO CHARGE AND ONCE CHARGED ONLY CUTS FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. I MEAN WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SELL A PRODUCT THIS BAD. THE BLADE IS WEAK AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT MAKES ME ANGRY. I AM DEFINITELY RETURNING THIS PIECE OF CRAP.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews on this before I made the purchase.  The reviews made me a bit skeptical but I made the order anyway.  When I opened the package, I read all of the instructions first.  I can see that some of the reviewers did not read the instructions, judging from the comments.  It works as advertised.  I use the 2mm setting for a my buzz cut and I am very happy with it. I have not used any other settings.  However, I have not yet been able to figure out how to make the trimmer (edger?)part of this device cut hair.</li>
    <li> Inside the box:   Clipper, 2 attachment combs, charging adapter, cleaning brush, lubricating oil, and manual.     Review:  I bought this last summer because I thought it was an innovative hair clipper aimed at people who cut their own hair. However, tapering with this clipper is a little hard, so if you want to try styles other than a buzz cut, I would recommend getting the regular hair clippers from Andis or Oster.     I have very thick and straight Asian hair, and this clipper did a good job of cutting through my hair, but I had to do several passes to get the hair nice and even. It takes a while to charge, around 14-16 hours, and lasts about 30-40 minutes on a single charge. It does not run with the adapter plugged in, so if it should run out of battery while cutting your hair, you&#x27;re out of luck and will have to wait to at least partially charge it or resume the next day. I will note that it almost broke down on me once, when it would not turn on after a night of charging. I turned it on and off maybe 20 times before it started working.    The attachments are easily adjustable with a scrolling wheel but they do not conform perfectly to certain areas of my head, like the sides. There are two attachments, one balding attachment which cuts from 1/32\\&quot; (I do not know how long it can cut) and one adjustable guide comb which cuts from 1/8\\&quot; to 1/2\\&quot;. The manual says that it can be washed under water but it says to lubricate it with the provided oil afterward. I recommend lubricating with oil before every haircut as with other clippers.    Summary:    Pros:  -Easy, respectable self buzz cuts  -Cordless  -Easy adjustment of attachments  -Easy to hold while cutting hair  -Easy to maintain, just clean blades with supplied brush and lubricate    Cons:  -Mainly for buzz cuts. ades, crew cuts, etc    -Cannot be operated while plugged in   -When the battery dies, the whole clipper has to be replaced    In conclusion, buy this if all you&#x27;re looking for is a buzz cut. You can giveyourself a decent buzz cut in about 10 minutes. If you&#x27;re looking to try different hair styles, invest in a clipper like the Andis Improved master or Oster Fast Feed clippers.</li>
    <li> As someone with no hair left on top, this works well for me. I read a bunch of reviews before I ordered it. Most concerning was the battery life. Mine seems to hold a charge just fine, no problem as of yet. For those with a full head of hair, I don&#x27;t know if its for you. Unless you want to keep your hair really short. Since its already saved me about $30 at the barber (sorry George) It has paid for itself in time and money. It works for me.  As of 3/7/15 The battery is holding a charge just fine. I&#x27;ve only charged it four times. This thing is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love it! cuts even and trims well. I have another simular product and this is by far the best.   I may get another for gifts...</li>
    <li> As noted, by other reviewers, the battery recharging time is long.    A light weight clipper with easy maneuverability.    Worked fine, for Burr and Butch style self cuts, except in flat areas; like the areas directly behind and above the ears, and the sideburns areas.    The trimmer does not have comb attachments, so it cannot be used to cut or trim the flat areas, to desired lengths.    A separate clipper, with the appropriate size comb, is required to cut, and trim the flat areas.    It is advisable to use a vacuum cleaner, to vacuum off the hair clippings, off the blades and device, instead of rinsing them off, under a faucet, as the owner&#x27;s guide, mentions the clipper blades are lubed for life, if the oil is not rinsed off.</li>
    <li> I had concerns over reviews saying that the battery may not last, but figured that since haircuts cost me $17, it will save money if I only use it twice. Went to my barber one last (?) time and got a 1/4&amp;#34; buzzcut. The product arrived in 5 days with super saver shipping. Everything was new and intact. Carefully read the manual and changed out the &amp;#34;balding comb&amp;#34; for adjustable comb guard. Have now used twice. It charged up well in 16 hours and ran for over 20 minutes. Unit cuts hair into tiny pieces, but as long as hair is already short, it cut evenly. Did not rinse under water, it was easy to brush out hair on blade after removing guard; can&#x27;t see adnvantage in washing and having to re-oil it. Have only used twice, but this means I have already saved money!   ***Feb., 2016  Sadly, it appears that Remington has discontinued this model and replaced it with one costing nearly 3X more. I have had my first SC100 now for over 5 years and use it an average of once per month. I occasionally still go to my barber to get cleaned up because this &amp;#34;electrobarber&amp;#34; does not do a very god job around my ears and the back of my neck. Because I was concerned about the reviewers reports of poor battery life, I purchased a second SC100 in April 2014. It is still in the box unused. I am sorry to see this model go, but if I ever need a new one, I am happy that Remington still offers a redesigned (and hopefully improved model). RIP SC-100.....</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and have used a Vidal Sassoon clipper for balding men for a few years. The Remington Short Cut Clipper is  an even better design for men who cut their own hair. It is hard to miss any spots and it cuts quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good hair clipper on Amazon and I saw that this Remington was the best selling. How can that be? I used to have one and it ended into the garbage can. The clipper worked fine but not perfect for a DIY job. However, it had major flaws. The battery didn&#x27;t hold enough charge and the battery died after some time. And you can not use it directly with electricity. So if the battery is dead. Guess what; It&#x27;s worthless.</li>
    <li> I had been fighting the idea of shaving my head.  I finally did it (at the barber shop).  It looked good for about a week.  My friend who has been shaving his head for years suggested this clipper.  Once I got it I read the directions and plugged it in for 12 to 14 hours.  Then I went to work, I have been cutting my kids hair for a couple years, so I thought this should be easy.  I set the setting 1 1/2 and I started to trim...I skipped the part of the instructions about starting with a higher setting...oops, but it came out all right.  It is supper easy to use.  it is a little messy, but it does a great job.</li>
    <li> The problem with this is that because of the structure of it, when you use it with the adjustable guide comb, hair gets stuck inside and it stops cutting after couple of seconds, so the only way to use it is without the guide. So you can use it only for marine style cut, and even that regular clipper will do it better. The pop-up trimmer doesnt cut anything.   To summarize it, this is my worst purchase in amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used a short clipper for about 10 years and when it wore out I bought this replacement.  It works very well and all I have to do is a short trim and volia no more barber shops.</li>
    <li> It works very well when it works.   My first clipper died in about 3 months. I didn&#x27;t take charge anymore. I called Customer Service for a replacement. CSR was not very polite but sent me a replacement promptly. Today, I just found out my second (replacement) unit died. Same reason, it doesn&#x27;t take charge anymore. I don&#x27;t think it worth $40 if it gets broken this easily. I&#x27;d rather just go to barbershop.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, gives a good clean cut</li>
    <li> two years later it wont hold enough charge to do one cut.  It gradually got to that point.  Its hard to use about a year out.    Would be a good product if the battery was quality.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased the Short Cut Clippers, I thought they were one of the best ideas ever to get a close, balding type cut.  The cut was great and the use was easy, much quicker than with my 15 year old corded Conair clippers, and they were a brand I trusted, Remington, the same brand as my 10 year old foil shaver.     After several uses, it started to act as if the batteries were running down during the cut.  They would turn on and right back off.  I found that if I oiled the blades, they would run again for a while, and at least let me finish the cut.  As time went by, they would always start the cut, but stop before I was done.  Sometimes oiling would help, and other times, they would continue to start and stop over and over again.    Having not kept the receipt and not being able to remember if I registered the product, I figured I would look into the problem myself.  With the unit apart, I could not make it stop running. It did not appear to be a battery problem, but some kind of mechanical binding problem.  I actually used it for several months with the outside case off, and it worked fine. After a couple more months of messing with it, and with it no longer charging, I pitched it in the trash and chalked it up to a defective one that got through the system.    As I was looking through Amazon.com today for some sort of similar clippers, I ran across the Short Cut Clippers again, and found that almost everyone was experiencing the same problem that I had, though most thought of it as a weak battery problem.      These clippers were a great idea poorly executed.  With so many people complaining of similar problems, Remington should have some kind of recall or reimbursement for these clippers.</li>
    <li> It died after 1 use.  It worked really well, then the battery stopped taking a charge and I can&#x27;t run it on the power cord either.  Of course I realized this after the 30 day Amazon warranty period.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the answer to my prayers for cutting my hair. The design matched my desire for something easy to use and intelligence. Instructions were informative and good. The cutter itself however does not have a strong enough motor to cut your hair. Disaster! Keeps jamming with little cutting. A total waste of time and money. And the lights are non functional after the first hair jam. This will make you appreciate a cutter with decent power. Its a pseudo cutter.  Looks great design wise; but no substance in really cutting your hair.  REMINGTON, PLEASE PUT IN A DECENT MOTOR. I AM WILLING TO PAY 100 DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL.  RIGHT NOW, ITS ON ONLY SUBSTANDARD.    IF IT REALLY CUT HAIR, IT WOULD BE THE BEST GENTLEMAN&#x27;S PERSONAL BARBER.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  Its very easy to use and works great.  I experienced what seemed like a charging issue mentioned in several reviews and finally discovered that if you rinse the cutter in some water - what seemed like a charging issue goes away.  Apparently the razor gets clogged up and rinsing it in water fixes the problem.  I was convinced that my unit wasn&#x27;t charging properly, so I read the directions.  I rinsed it off when I thought it was near dead and it worked like new without re-charging.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I bought this because the design looked ergo and convenient compared to a typical clipper.  However, the \\&quot;balding\\&quot; comb doesn&#x27;t come close to a real bald cut.  This cuts more like a #1/2 or #1 on a standard clipper.  Waste of money if you want something close to a shaved look.    Buy the Wahl Balding Clipper.  It&#x27;s very close to a shave.</li>
    <li> I have been giving myself hair cuts for many years now. I am replacing a \\&quot;classic\\&quot; cutter with this. I keep my hair short and it is fine and thinning. So this cutter has no problem with cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - It gives a very nice and very clean and even looking cut. I really like the design and the comfort of using it. I also like that it is as simple as a \\&quot;back and forth\\&quot; motion and you really do get a nice results. The adjustable guard  (length) system is great and the extendable trimmer works as you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - First off this bad boy is messy to use! It is much more messy than a \\&quot;classic\\&quot; style cutter. The back and forth action produces tons of small cut off pieces that rain down (as does a one way action). The other issue is that I used this on my son who has very thick and more than a normal persons share of hair. His hair was a little longer (like a couple of inches). This cutter could not handle the thickness and length. It was consistently clogging the cutter guides and was just not getting the job done. I had to get one of my classic cutters and cut his hair down to a length just longer than the length I wanted to end with. Once I cut off the \\&quot;excess\\&quot; hair then the cutter gave a very nice finished look. (again making a mess)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not thrilled with it being a rechargeable as I would prefer a cord so I would not have to deal with what I know will be the eventual and certain battery failure as all rechargeables have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all I like the unit as it really does a nice job and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  I like my hair very short.  Almost bald.  This does the job.  Works best when your scalp is clean and dry.</li>
    <li> Works well, but battery recharge feature is short lived.  Have bought 3 of them, only because they cut very well.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair around 1/16 of an inch and this little tool is perfect for the job.  Once charged it runs for weeks without additional charge.  I used to use an old clipper.  This is faster and does a much better job.    Thanks,    N</li>
    <li> So... I&#x27;ve been buzzing my head for a number of years now... I&#x27;m a clipper snob... Finding a clipper that does the job without sawing your head off is not always easy... There are plenty of cheaply made rechargeable clippers out there... Some of those cheaply made clippers are far from being cheap in price... I buzz my head once or twice a week... The last set of Whal clippers I purchased barely lasted 6 months... I can&#x27;t remember the company that made the clippers I used before the Whal clippers but they lasted maybe 6 months as well... Anyway... I decided to order the Remington Short Cut Clippers despite a few bad reviews and I am very pleased so far... Now I cut with the balding guard on and set to the lowest setting... It appears that the Short Cut cuts shorter than other clippers I have used... I like that !! Easy to go longer if I want... The price of the Short Cut also surprised me... I hate to say this but I figured they could not be that good cause they were so much cheaper than other clippers... Funny thing is that the Short Cut looks like it would cost much more... My Whal clippers cost $60 or more dollars and looked cheaply made (Apparently they were cheaply made cause the plastic parts in the cutter head broke down after 6 months)... Anyway... So far I really like the short cut... The pop up trimmer is kinda useless in my opinion but for some reason manufacturers think you just have to put one of those little things on there to sell the product... They could have left it off and I would have still bought it... Or, hey Remington... Why don&#x27;t you sell the Short cut with a beard groomer and ear / nose clipper all in one set... In a zip up travel bag perhaps... Make sure they all use the same charger... Just a thought... So... I like these things so much I made a Facebook page... I love the Remington SCC100R Short Cut Clipper ... &amp;lt;...&gt;... If they end up failing me I shall cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war on them !!! have a nice day... BMB</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I used to cut my hair with a corded clipper. Easy enough process, with good results, but it would take about 10 minutes and I would have to pass over the same area multiple times. With this product, I can do a clean and short cut in less than three minutes and I do not need to do multiple passes. This makes keeping my haircut short, and at the length I like it, very, very easy. To anyone that likes a short and close haircut, this product is a must.</li>
    <li> PLEASE SEE MY UPDATE #2 at end of review for battery rejuvenation procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have a semi buzz cut style, it seemed increasingly silly to pay the barber $15 for the 5 minutes he spends on me.  I purchased this clipper for less than the cost of two \\&quot;professional\\&quot; haircuts.  It works well enough for me that I haven&#x27;t gone back to the barber, but there are certainly some areas for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The rechargeable batteries are non-replaceable, and they only last about a year or 10 recharges.  Therefore, you&#x27;ll have to buy an entirely new clipper every twelve months, or go through the warranty replacement hassle.  Still, $26 replacement cost per year beats 10 professional haircuts at $15 each ($150).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The little thumb dial that sets the haircut length does not have a firm notch for each setting.  Because it&#x27;s right under your finger in the natural grip position, it&#x27;s easy to accidentally twitch it during the course of a haircut, usually to a shorter setting.  And if you press the clipper against your head firmly, the cutter guides will \\&quot;collapse\\&quot; to a shorter setting.  So that&#x27;s two ways you can end up with a much shorter cut than you really wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) While cutting your hair, you must remember to hold the clipper at the same angle to your head all over your head. Hold it at a perpendicular right angle to your noggin.  If you tilt it back and forth as you run it around, the hair length becomes shorter as you tilt it more.  I suspect this is why some folks have complained about getting a \\&quot;patchy\\&quot; haircut, with various lengths in different areas of the head - they were tilting the cutter back and forth on different parts of their head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) With this clipper, you will still have difficulty creating a taper or sharp edge on the back of your neck.  I just live with it, but some people may not like that.  Or get your significant other to cut that last bit using the pop-up trimmer or the lowest setting on the hair length guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I did, with great difficulty, disassemble the clipper in an attempt to replace the batteries.  However, the batteries are spot-welded to their connectors.  My past experience with trying to solder wires to batteries was unsuccessful, so I did not replace the batteries in this clipper.  (Short rant: I&#x27;m seeing far too many small consumer items which have non-replaceable batteries spot-welded in place.  I just threw away a $100 dollar ultrasonic toothbrush because the batteries were dead and welded in place.  This is not environmentally nor consumer friendly - why should I toss 100&#x27;s of dollars worth of electronic parts in the landfill just because the batteries, which could be replaced for less than $5, are welded permanently in place. And to add insult to injury, these appliances - like this clipper - will not run and perform their function when plugged into the charger.  So once the battery is dead, you can&#x27;t even choose to use it in the plugged in mode.  Frankly, I think this kind of non-replaceable battery design should be illegal, for environmental protection reasons.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it&#x27;s the only product like this available.  If somebody came out with a similar curved edge clipper design with replaceable batteries, able to run while plugged in and has a more reliable hairlength control, I&#x27;d switch to that product - and I&#x27;d come back here and reduce this rating to 1 or 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; UPDATE &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s now 9 months after my review.  I&#x27;ve used the Remington about once every two weeks during that period, for 5 minutes at a time.  That&#x27;s 18 times or 90 minutes of running time, always recharged between each use.  The clipper has now become useless, incapable of running for more than 30 seconds when fully charged. So I saved the cost of 12 haircuts, 12 times $15 is $180.  That&#x27;s $180 I saved with this $26 purchase.  While it&#x27;s very annoying that the batteries in this device are sopoor and non-replaceable, the return on investment is pretty good and I&#x27;ll probably buy another to replace this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; IMPORTANT UPDATE #2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s 12 months after purchase.  I&#x27;ve discovered that you can substantially rejuvenate the batteries by occasionally COMPLETELY discharging them before recharging.  This is contrary to the manufacturers instructions, which claim it&#x27;s OK to leave the device plugged into the charger permanently.  Instead, I now occasionally turn the cutter on and leave it running until it&#x27;s completely discharged and stops running.  I let it sit for 1/2 an hour, then I turn it on AGAIN and leave it running.  I keep doing this, over and over again, until finally it will no longer come on even briefly.  Then I give it a full overnight charge.  The result is that it will now run for 8-12 minutes rather than 30 seconds, and that&#x27;s more than enough time to give myself a haircut.  So my advice - about every fourth haircut, you must give the batteries a completely thorough discharge in order to rejuvenate their recharge life.  It might even make sense to rejuvenate the batteries soon after you first receive a new cutter, since apparently there are a lot of these cutters that have been sitting in warehouses for years, slowly draining the batteries.d I&#x27;ll probably buy another to replace this one.    &gt;&gt; IMPORTANT UPDATE #2 &lt;&lt;  Now it&#x27;s 12 months after purchase.

    <li> Do you want a nice even hair cut?  If so, this product is for you.  It is so easy to use.  Decent battery life.  The only drawback that I have found is that due to its curved shape it is hard to cut your side burns and the areas around your ears.  This is a minor inconvenience in my opinion for an otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> As a newbie to the short hair set I was very unhappyat the prospect of $15 every 2-3 weeks at a barbershop for a proper  trim.  With this Remington Short Cut even if the battery dies after 2-3 months I will be ahead in money.    If I need to charge it overnight it really is not a problem. Plug it on when I leave for work and I&#x27;m good to go  the next morning.  What could be easier!  My wife &amp; customers think I look younger with shorter hair up top  even with my grey beard.  Not bad for a 64 year old! My lady loves how I look &amp; so do I!  Thanks Remington!</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper several months ago and after using it three times, the unit fails to operate.  It will not accept a charge from it&#x27;s charger.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t do reviews but I love this thing so much that I thought to write a quick review.  This clipper saves me time and money for the short haircut I love.  It is easy to use, easy to clean and light.  If your looking for something to cut your hair at all one length without without paying a barber.. then get this device.  I will pay for itself in the first 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I have had this clipper for two months and it works very well.  I normally pay a barber $11 every two weeks for a cut.  So the clipper has already paid for itself.  The pop out side burn trimmer is pretty useless, but I have other trimmers for that.  Definitely recommend if you want to save money and time on trips to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-25-14 Update.  I am still using this clipper about every two weeks.  No battery problems.  I will buy another one of these if this one ever wears out or blades get dull.</li>
    <li> Cuts my hair just great with the #1 setting. I still have to trim around my ears, though with my old clippers as it doesn&#x27;t go close enough to my ears.  It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Last about 2 years each.</li>
    <li> When I first got the Shortcut I really liked it. I had no problem getting an even trim and the adjustment mechanism was quick and consistent. However, the battery life began getting short. After a few months I had to plan ahead and charge the battery overnight before trimming my hair. That was fine for a few months, and then it got so bad that it couldn&#x27;t last through a trim, and now it won&#x27;t charge at all. I see no point wasting money repairing a bad design. I&#x27;ve gone back to my AC-powered Wahl trimmer. It may be bulkier, but it runs every time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews good and bad, and decided to purchase it anyway because the method of \\&quot;combing\\&quot; with this clipper seemed like it would be a much more natural action than trimming with normal hair-clippers.    I am not disappointed. In fact, I&#x27;ve found that I can neatly trim the back of my neck with this. This is something I&#x27;ve never been able to do by myself with conventional clippers.    The caveat is that it is a great tool for maintaining the length of a short haircut, but but not such a great tool for cutting hair that is not already in a crew cut. You will need a conventional clipper or a trip to the barber to start out.    When I received it, I plugged it in to charge a whole day before use. Upon initial turn-on the motor started with an enthusiastic buzz, but then dropped in pitch and held a steady, but lower, speed. I initially thought that perhaps I had a unit with a bad battery that would not hold a charge, however I&#x27;ve used it extensively for a few weeks and it always keeps going for as long as I&#x27;ve needed to run it. I guess it just starts up \\&quot;fast\\&quot;, but the lower steady speed is the normal speed.    I&#x27;m happy that I can do a really quick trim to maintain my haircut once or more each week. It is cordless, so I can do this in the shower-stall (without water) to contain the mess and then just rinse away the trimmings, which are no bigger than shaving stubble. I also use it to maintain my beard. The comb-shape is not quite as natural a motion for that, but it is, nevertheless, effective, neat, and fast.    In sum, I recommend this trimmer 100% for maintaining an existing crew-cut.</li>
    <li> I wanted a durable, easy-to-use, hair-trimmer to save money on haircuts. The product seems to be durably built BUT it certainly doesn&#x27;t even come close to working as advertised. Even with the guides in place and all the settings in proper order - this clipper can barely take off a few strands of hair. The razor barely cuts and the guide is almost totally ineffective at positioning the hair for cutting. I think traditional clippers probably work better, as they use the scalp as the cutting platform. This clipper attempts to cut your hair from above by using hair attachments to position the hair against the blade.  Well, like I said . . . . no recommendation here! The Remington Shortcut just . . . doesn&#x27;t cut it!</li>
    <li> works well for a once a month haircut or touch up on short man&#x27;s cut..easier to use than clippers, not as much flexibility so it takes a few cuts to get the hang of it especially on the sides.  it is a little flimsy compared to say a Wahl or Remington clipper, plastic-y.. but I like these, would buy again.  have only used a few times, charge seems fine, others have had issues, time will tell.  bot for $32, a week later it was $29..these go up and down in price a lot apparently, shop around.  to me it seems like a $19.99 item not a $30 item.. saving me hundreds/year over barber cuts.</li>
    <li> good but too soft plastic</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my dad because he&#x27;s been cutting his own hair with clippers for years. He loves how easy it is to use this new design. I&#x27;m planning on buying 3 more for my brother and my cousins.</li>
    <li> As many of the reviewers have noted - The battery on the SC100 is Terrible!! After a few months it may take you 2 days to get a complete haircut. My current SC100 now only works for a single pass through my hair then I have to shut it off for a few minutes. This is a process that can go on for hours. (At least it makes me keep me hair short so it&#x27;ll be easier to cut and shorten the process) - I now have the new replacement the SC100R and will update this review to reflect its performance. For the moment I&#x27;ll carry over my impression of the older model. Its a GREAT haircutting system!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it could be used while plugged in but I think Remington knows that you&#x27;ll probably do what I did and simply buy another (Very sneaky! and possibly the reason they ignore the poor battery issue). This is something you should be aware of if you plan to buy this product. I&#x27;m holding out hope that the deluge of complaints about the first version has at least convinced them to produce a product that lasts for the better part of a year. We&#x27;ll see. Stay tuned I&#x27;ll be reporting back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2.5 Years Later - Seems my 2nd version are still working fine BUT I baby them. I WD40 and clean before any use and only charge them the night before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE2: 3.7 Years Later - Just bought 3rd pair. After getting latest pair I think my 1st and 2nd were faulty. The green(100RC)/blue(100R) charging light never came on for them and I left them plugged up for about a month. Until then they were fine, both had battery issues after that. My second pair was excellent since I never left them plugged up UNTIL I thought since they were working so good that everything was fixed and I left them on the charger. I think the faulty indicator allowed them to overcharge and killed the battery. I&#x27;m mad cause they were the nice shiny metallic ones (SCC-100RC) that I cant find anymore. Still for this price I&#x27;ll prob grab a backup in 6+ months or so and unplug these when not using (I dont trust the indicator even though it works). NICE Product but SERIOUS Battery Issues!! (maybe they&#x27;re fixed but I wont be testing it)tor even though it works). NICE Product but SERIOUS Battery Issues!! (maybe they&#x27;re fixed but I wont be testing it)</li>
    <li> Great Product, Excellent seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent product if you like to keep your hair short.  I use the setting that clips the hair down to about 1/8&amp;#34; and use the clipper about once a week.  You have to follow the instructions and use a circular motion while trimming or it won&#x27;t work worth a darn.  This is my second unit and the first lasted about 7 years.</li>
    <li> The battery on my first Remington Short Cut was deteriorating and finally wouldn&#x27;t take a charge. The clipper was cutting unevenly, and I wasn&#x27;t really happy with it, but I couldn&#x27;t find a good alternative for the price. In reading some of the previous opinions, I learned that it is critical to be using the correct comb. It is virtually impossible to discern which comb is which from the instructions, but it does say the product arrives with one type of comb. Most people will probably need to change the comb. This was my error. I did change the comb, and the clipper is working perfectly giving me a nice even cut which I can do myself. The product is made for short and balding hair. In reading the instructions, I also discovered that I was cleaning it improperly, so I suspect that has helped its performance. I am now completely satisfied with the product, although I think the instructions could be clearer. I have also learned that I should RTFM on any product I buy.</li>
    <li> I saw an ad in a magazine for the Short Cut and thought it would be perfect for me. I&#x27;ve been buzzing my head for about a year now and I use no attachments so its as short as it gets without using a razor. I tried the Short Cut out this morning for the first time and I&#x27;ll give it an A- overall.     It did seem to come with some sort of charge but I charged it overnight to be safe, didn&#x27;t want to run out of battery halfway. As others may have pointed out be aware that the attachment installed when you first open it is the &#x27;balding&#x27; attachment which will have no change if you set the adjustable numbers higher, its for super short only. Normally I cut my hair about every 5 days. I sometimes do it more often but waiting a few days in between makes it easier to see what&#x27;s been cut and what hasn&#x27;t. I used the Short Cut this morning after about 3 and a half days or growth. Overall impression is it works very well. Being that I wasn&#x27;t taking much length off it did take a few more passes than normal to get everything but it definitely does clip on both the back and forth movements. What I really liked is there seemed to be no way to cut myself which is a constant worry with regular clippers. It took a couple minutes to figure out the best angle to get all parts of my head; some parts cut better front to back, some side to side. It just depends on the way your hair grows. What threw me off at first is it doesn&#x27;t make as much &#x27;grinding&#x27; noise as its cutting. Its quieter overall which is nice, although the &#x27;grinding&#x27; sound is usually my audible confirmation that I definitely cut a patch of hair. The front and sides cut pretty easily but where this thing really shines is in back. It only took me about 20 seconds to do the whole back of my head. With regular clippers I&#x27;d do the back and then have to spot check with a mirror.    The only real problem I had was with my sideburns. Maybe its just the shape of my head but I couldn&#x27;t get it to sit low enough to get them. I eventually found a way of doing it but it put the Short Cut dangerously close to my eyebrows so I&#x27;ll have to be really careful. There is another small flat trimmer that pops out of the top but it seems to be a little shorter than the curved blade so it might make my sideburns a tad too short, I&#x27;ll experiment next time.    Just for comparison I whipped out my old clippers to see how close the Short Cut actually cuts. The clippers did cut a tiny bit shorter but it was totally negligible, the hair that fell into the sink was as thin as powder so the Short Cut seems to trim just as short.     Pros:  -cordless  -curved blades hug my head well and cut both back and forth  -30 minutes of runtime is adequate for a couple uses before recharging  -nicking yourself is almost impossible  -fits very well in my hand    Cons:  -some places are hard to reach with curved blade  -needs to be shaken out once a minute or so, the hair tends to fall in instead of out as you cut so it can get clogged up but a quick shake or tap clears it out.  -no carry case included  -relatively long charge time (says 14-16 hours for full recharge)    Overall I like it and I&#x27;ll use it from now on. The small size and cordless power is especially nice for traveling too :)</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the versatility of the [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper]].  I have keratosis on my scalp and favor a nearly bald hair length to facilitate medicating, which this delivers without undue interference with the keratosis scaling.  But the adjustability also allows me to have more length on the sides and the back.  A friend recently commented on how good my haircut was.  When I told her that I did it and with what, she remarked that she wished it had been available when she went through chemotherapy years ago and lost her hair then grew it back.  All this and it pays for itself in less then 3 uses!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like I thought. Not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for a while now (not quite completely bald), with varying degrees of success determined by what kind of clippers I use.  The Remington Short Cut Clipper however is by far the best brand of clippers I have used thus far, managing to get my hair as short and close as possible without leaving me bald.  The curved design feature works very well and leaves things pretty even around the curve of the back of the head, and the cordless nature of the clipper doesn&#x27;t hurt things either.  If there&#x27;s any downside to the Remington Short Cut Clipper, it&#x27;s that the clipper&#x27;s charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as one may hope, but considering how well the clipper works for being what it is, this is only a minor gripe.  All in all, you can certainly do worse in terms of self-grooming, and with that note alone, the Remington Short Cut Clipper is certainly worth a try at the very least.</li>
    <li> Works great, holds a charge, but their size measurements on the clips are not what they advertise. I normally cut my hair with a Wahl Clipper with the 3mm adapter, and have also used a Braun one with the 3mm. Both cut the same length. This one however, when using the 3mm, cuts longer and if I use the Braun after I still get a goot 1-2mm off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, not a bad product. Though I do think it&#x27;s slightly more money than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I placed this order by mistake from my cellphone when I tried to cancel it in ten minutes them guys they denied me access .</li>
    <li> I could not get an even cut on #2. This is partially because the blade doesn&#x27;t lift the hair like a standard trimmer. Also, the side of my head and the back of my neck (behind the ears) are apparently not rounded like the trimmer. I had to drop to the shortest cut to get my hair even over my entire head.     It takes about 20 to 30mins to finish. I need to keep checking the cut using two mirrors. And, because the blade if vertical, the hair clippings are very fine and multiple passes are need. It is best to use this in the shower (w/o water running) or over the tub because the clippings are not easy to cleanup.     It doesn&#x27;t seem any better than a good cordless clippers/trimmers for buzz cuts and is worse for #2 and above.</li>
    <li> Being short on hair anymore I decided to chuck the constant ritual of visiting the barber and shave what was left.  My son-in-law purchased a Remington Short Cut Clipper and offered to let me try his.  I was very satisfied with the results and decided to purchase one for myself.  It has now become a welcome part of my morning ritual.  Easy to use, easy to clean, even a caveman could use it.  I would highly recommend it.  Donald</li>
    <li> It works fine up until maybe the 3rd time and then cutting quality goes down drastically.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for someone who wants to cut his own hair, without assistance.  Read the instructions carefully before using.  Unless you want a skin head, remove the comb that comes installed and install the adjustable comb.  The only problem I have had is managing the fallen hair.  Beware of hair falling down your back and sticking to your undershirt.  Best to cut your hair shirtless, and take a shower afterwards.</li>
    <li> Its perfect if you like keeping your hair almost bald. Its well constructed the battery lasts long.    You can give your self a nice short fade as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper to cut my own hair because the shops around here charge me overall $5-8 more per haircut than they do my husband.  I don&#x27;t get a shampoo or any kind of cut or style that should cost more.  I just get a regular short cut.  This clipper paid for itself in the first 2-3 haircuts I gave myself.      It charges fast &amp; holds a charge very well.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  You can wash it out under running water to get the little hair chips out of it.  It&#x27;s light &amp; shaped nicely to your hand.      I have found that it doesn&#x27;t cut as short as they say it does.  I use the #2 setting for the top of my head &amp; the 1.5 setting for the sides &amp; back.  I&#x27;m thinking of trying the #1 setting for the sides next time just to see if that&#x27;s better.  I also use the regular guard rather than the balding comb thing.  I have found too that if you don&#x27;t wait long between cuts it does better.  I have very, very thick hair.  It isn&#x27;t overly fine but it isn&#x27;t real coarse either.  I get a better cut if I don&#x27;t let it get too long.      Overall it&#x27;s a great tool &amp; it makes it so that I don&#x27;t ever have to spend 45 minutes in a chair trying to convince some timid hairdresser that I really DO know how short I want my hair &amp; then still leaving disappointed that I never could get it like I wanted.  Now, I do it myself &amp; I&#x27;m a lot happier.  And after the first 2 or 3 cuts, it had paid for itself so now it&#x27;s just savings for me.      I would buy a replacement of this clipper if mine broke today.  I have been happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for clippers that would allow me to cut my own hair and give me the ability to trim my neck by myself.  This is great and allows me to do what I need.  It pays for itself in two uses based on what it used to cost for a haircut.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re the type that likes to give yourself your own haircut from time to time, Remington&#x27;s Short Cut Clipper is a solid tool if you have &#x27;some&#x27; experience administering clipper cuts to your self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade shape of this clipper set was clearly designed for DIY Barbers as its curvature allows for a more intuitive feel on your head.  Rather then mowing a set of clippers in difficult to reach areas such as the back of your head, this set is designed for users to blindly sweep back and forth like a hair brush and maintain even results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also found to particularly helpful is the fact that this device is cordless (albeit after a lengthy charge) which allows for quick and easy cleanup by taking this outdoors.  Give this device a try if you&#x27;re even a tiny bit curious and a fan of short cuts - the device will pay for itself within 2-3 uses.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I first heard of this product.  I used it at least half a dozen times, but after that I went back to my old straight-edge clipper.  I found that this clipper simply isn&#x27;t very efficient in time or effort.  I typically just shave my head (the ol&#x27; buzz cut), and when using this clipper I had to go over my head a lot more times before I was satisfied that I had cut all my hair down to the level I wanted.  Another minus:  you have to plan ahead to make sure it is fully charged before you cut.    I really wanted this product to work, but in the end I&#x27;m now back to my clipper.</li>
    <li> Have had mine for several years now and for the price, it&#x27;s awesome. It does exactly what I need, and the cons don&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very short, even trim of had and face in a few minutes (about every 5 days).&lt;br /&gt;The rounded blade definitely helps around head.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality for price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a bald shave, this product won&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a long time to charge and battery doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work when plugged in (probably for safety reasons).&lt;br /&gt;The little trimmer is useless.&lt;br /&gt;Messy. I do it outside. Product would need a vacuum to fix that, though.&lt;br /&gt;The length adjustment wheel is in a place where you can accidentally move it to shorter with your thumb; I used to trim my hair longer, then accidentally rolled that dial; but I liked the result.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when you take it out of country; the charger is only good for 120VAC and I fried mine last week, so getting another one.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, this is a replacement as I have used one for more than two years, great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, does everything it states.  This is my second one the first one on/off swithch broke after 2 years, but this is a very durable and well made product.</li>
    <li> Purchased first unit in Feb 2011.  It died this morning.  Four years of pretty good service.  Nice easy to handle and use.  The battery did not hold a change for the past 12 months or so.  Have had to charge it before each use for the past year.  Does a great job of keeping the hair short.  Just ordered the second.  Guessing that I used the first one about 125+ times.  Paid $27 for unit one.  That&#x27;s works out to &amp;#60; 21 cents per cut. Not bad.  I would leave the unit on and allow the battery to drain about once a month and would not charge it until the day before the next cut. Agree with most of the users that Remington should spend a few bucks more for a better battery.  Will review the new unit in about a year.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t fool myself anymore.  The hair on top of my head was gone (except for the peach fuss).  I asked myself &amp;#34;why spend $20 on a hair cut&amp;#34;.  I now keep my hair very short and this works great.  I am done in 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> First lets start that I have nothing bad to say about amazon, because they held up their end of the deal. This is totally about the product. The first one I bought didn&#x27;t hold a charge, even after trying to charge it for over 24 hrs. So had to return that one. The new one they sent me took 18 hrs. to charge and it works for about 1 haircut, then you have to put it back on the charger for a good 12 hrs. Next, if you have really short hair, like skin tight this won&#x27;t help you at all. I does cut short, but the \\&quot;balding\\&quot; cut, isn&#x27;t \\&quot;balding\\&quot; it is more like \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; cut. So you guys who like to keep your hair ultra close, don&#x27;t bother with this. And finally, I found that it pulls your hair when cutting, and this hurts! So if you keep your hair skintight or don&#x27;t have the time to wait for this thing to charge, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These are the worst clippers that I have ever owned!  They do not work well on long hair.  They do not hold a charge well.  They do not work with the AC cord attached.  They do not cut well on flat parts of the head or around the ears.  They are terrible.  I can&#x27;t believe that these were produced by Remington!  Stay away.</li>
    <li> Tried the suggestions of other reviewers to start with a longer length then get shorter until you get the length you want. My hair was already short so it shouldn&#x27;t have mattered. No matter how many times I went over my head and in all directions it left tufts that were longer. For some reason though the sides were cut extremely short! I tried several times and never got an even cut. And as others have said the comb fills up quickly. I only gave this a two because it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Wahl Balding Clippers today and I have to say all the reviews are right on the money. You get a very close cut the appearance of the one day look. I didnt have any nicks or cuts like some experianced. I had a nice smooth shave and I am very happy with the results.  I give it 5 Stars compared to the other wahl clippers I have purchased at Target. They just never got the closeness I needed without going to a blade.  Hope this helps your decision.</li>
    <li> Okay for what it is. If you shave your head and skip for a few days, clippers work better.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my previous Short Cut Clipper which broke due to being dropped-I did have some of the reported issues with the old unit especially as related to the battery and was a little hesitant to buy again but did go ahead and take a chance since it was on sale for almost half price-must say this unit seems much better at least so far-after a number of cuts, I am having NO battery issues at all (fingers crossed) and even if I did so, the clipper has already more than paid for itself-</li>
    <li> I have struggled a lot to use this product and it doesn&#x27;t work and now I found out it is late to return it.  learned a lesson.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Works nice so far. Good for short hair. I trim main to 1/8\\&quot; every two-three days and have no problems, but doubt if it will be good for longer than 1/4\\&quot; hair.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I am not giving 5 stars for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Low battery indicator shows only low battery, no levels.&lt;br /&gt;2. When charger is on, the clipper can not be used.&lt;br /&gt;3. The charger is 110V/50Hz only. Most manufacturers now offer world compatibility 110-240V/50-60Hz&lt;br /&gt;4. The brush has too small handle.&lt;br /&gt;5. The brush can not be attached to the clipper. Having a pocket in the clipper&#x27;s body would be great (e.g. see Dyson and other vac&#x27;s designs).&lt;br /&gt;6. The oil container is so small and tough to handle. I use my own lubricator.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;The listed concerns are minor. I am already recommending this product to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut Kit]]</li>
    <li> I got this product because We got a mohawk for my little boy. We did this last year and it was expensive to have the sides trimmed once a week. If you did not get it trimmed often it looked bad. I figured that three trim jobs would pay for the clipper.     My hair had gotten relatively long and it is thick and curly. I tried to cut my own hair before I charged the battery. This was a Mistake on both parts.  This clipper had a problem cutting the long thick curly hair, and the battery ran down about a forth of the way through. it was late and I had to work the next morning. I used other means to cut my hair to a more manageable length, put the clipper on the charger and went to bed.    I had a whole new experience the next morning. IT took about 2 minutes to cut my hair, no one knew that it had not been done at the barber shop. Then I trimmed my son&#x27;s hair, once again it looked good, no one knew the difference. One haircut to go and it will pay for its self.    This product is as advertised, and works well for its intended purpose.</li>
    <li> The product would be fine if it were not for the absolutely horrible battery life. After only 3 uses it barely holds any charge, and is severely underpowered for the short duration of time that it does run. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research before ordering this product - preferred the cordless feature and unique cutting design.  After having it for over a month and using it 3 times, I find the clipper to work as advertised; easy to use, cuts back and forth, the pop out trimmer works great.  The only drawback is that the (cordless) power doesn&#x27;t seam to be at its peak, even after a full charge.  It doesn&#x27;t run out - a typical buzz cut takes me about 4 to 5 minutes - but the power seams to fluctuate.&lt;br /&gt;hArrYcaLLaHAn</li>
    <li> Used once, cut shorter than I wanted on top, sides were fine. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the clippers or my hair, was my hair too wet, hair too thin, my cowlick, whatever but they didn&#x27;t want to cut the crown of my head so I kept repeating and changing the setting shorter. So instead of shorter sides than on top, I wound up pretty much with the same length all over. Not a problem, it does grow back in most places and it didn&#x27;t look bad. Probably should have had an assistant help me the first time or two. I&#x27;m trying for short on the sides with long enough on top to lay down. Going to do the sides again this weekend and see if I can keep from getting too far up.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. It pulls hair, does not cut evenly.I could not get a even cut by myself and had to get someone else tho help me.</li>
    <li> I have had 3 of these short cut clippers and none of them have worked, They wont hold a charge and will not turn on. Ive contacted remmington cust. serv. to no avail. Do not, I repeat do not buy this product it is junk.</li>
    <li> You know how your grass looks after you go over a rounded hill with your lawnmower?? Yea, kind of like that. Used the guard attachment and 70% looked good, the rest noticeably shorter. One use and off to the barber shop for damage control. Terrible</li>
    <li> I purchased the first one from Walmart about a year ago. It quit working within 3-4 months. Wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and then ultimately died completely. My husband loved it so I searched everywhere (stores) to find another one, no one carried them, no surprise. Then I finally found one on Amazon, yea, I was so happy to find another. Plugged it in to charge according to manufacturer directions, and big surprise NOTHING! Doesn&#x27;t work at all, won&#x27;t even turn on. Plugged it back in and the green light won&#x27;t even illuminate.  What a piece of junk.  Won&#x27;t try again but I will write to Remington to tell them to fix their product.  Great concept if it would just run.</li>
    <li> Pros: Hammacher takes items back without question&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This trimmer is the worst. It barely holds a charge, pulls hair, and is poorly made. Unless you use it daily and charge it nightly, it is worthless. How hard is it to make a decent clipper. I cannot believe that Hammacher even sells this thing, as they usually offer quality products.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS TRIMMER AND FIND IT WORKS VERY WELL, IN BETWEEN VISITS TO THE BARBER. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> I took a long time deciding which cordless clipper to buy, and I&#x27;m very glad I settled on this Remington Short Cut model. I opened the box, replaced the pre-packaged balding comb with the retractable one, set it to my desired length, and started cutting. It took me about 30 or 40 minutes to do my head since it had grown much longer than I would normally let it get. The clipper cut right through my hair with a number of passes. I had to stop occasionally and blow out the hair that had built up inside the comb, but it did a superb job. I switched back to the balding comb to do the back of my neck, and it gave me a professional-looking, clean job there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell this model is not for everyone. In my opinion, it works best for short cuts and especially for the ones that are the same length all over. For my balding head, this clipper is ideal. I can see now that I&#x27;ll simply have to give a few passes of the brush-like motion every other week or so, and I will easily maintain a look that rivals cuts from the barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it right out of the box, and I&#x27;m very pleased. I highly recommend the brush-like Remington Short Cut clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add: I am still using this clipper as of this writing (Sept. 8, 2013), and it&#x27;s still running strong. I cut my hair monthly, and I&#x27;ve had no complaints with this clipper.</li>
    <li> Love it. I shave my head. It only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li> EDIT: **TWO years of weekly use and still works as new!!** Remember to oil before each use and thoroughly clean with a brush after. And always fully charge before using. Would love to see Remington to release a new model with USB charging of this item (They have it in other models).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the mixed reviews, I waited for a year and about 40 uses to write mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this clipper every weekend, at 1, 1.5, 2 or 3, depending on the mood. Usually 1.5. In my case it works great, I have very thick hair and the blades chop it without problem. However, if I let my hair grow a bit more that the usual (2-3 weeks) and I want to use the shortest sizes, the clipper will have a hard time (And so do I), but in the end it can do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the maintenance I have found out that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You need to charge it ALWAYS. The motor requires the battery to be in its top capacity. I tried using the clipper until it really needed recharging but the motor couldn&#x27;t keep working. ALWAYS CHARGE the clipper after using it. Because the battery is Lithium-Ion it can hold the charge adequately for at least a week in my case.&lt;br /&gt;2) Also, ALWAYS clean and oil the clipper: Before using it I add a drop or two of oil for each centimeter along the blades. After using it I take a small brush, take out the guide and brush it through. I haven&#x27;t even gone through half the oil bottle included, a recommended replacement would be 3-in-1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some cons, one is the charging adapter, it is 120V only, if I need to travel to somewhere else where the voltage is 100V or 220/240V, it will not work. This isn&#x27;t a travel friendly item. (However Remington has a USB rechargeable clipper on their catalog!). Also it doesn&#x27;t let to use the clipper while charging. The battery isn&#x27;t replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything taken into account, this is a great item, for me it only needs a 100-240V international adapter, a replaceable battery andit will be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to Remington about the adapter, they just said something along the lines of \\&quot;Buy another one wherever you go\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if they have it available everywhere.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever bought. I have been using the Short Cut Clipper for over 6 years now and I have nothing but positive things to say about it. It works perfectly, cuts well and is super reliable.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works for what it is intended for..very short haircuts.    But a serious problem is the battery, it simply does not last very long and the battery quickly loses its ability to charge at all rendering the product useless since you can&#x27;t use it plugged it.    Bottom line, works well but very poor quality product.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty sturdy and effcient hair clipper. However, it only applies to people who want to maintain their hair at a very short length. It&#x27;s relatively easy to use. The settings can be easily set by a dial at the handle, it also has a pop-out trimmer for touching up side-burns and behnd the neck. It has a balding comb. It also comes with a small bursh and cleaning oil. As mentioned earlier, not for those who want to keep their hair long.</li>
    <li> Husband cuts hair and beard to short length without spotty appearance.  Can trim hair and beard in a very short time.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these a couple of years ago.  I liked the ease with which it trimmed my hair.  I normally use it ever 2 weeks at the 1 1/2 setting.  It is very difficult to use around the ears.  I also found that it didn&#x27;t hold a charge for long.  Many times it would quit before I finished and would have to plug it back in and let it charge for a while to charge up again.  The charging light quit after a short time too.  It would be nice if you could use the trimmer while it was plugged in and charging, but it won&#x27;t do that.  Just recently it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all, even after leaving it plugged in for several weeks.  I finally decided to chuck it.  I thought I would take it apart to check the inside to see if maybe there was a loose wire or something, and I found lots of hair clippings gumming it up inside.  It&#x27;s a great idea, but needs much improvement.</li>
    <li> This clipper worked great for 6 weeks until the battery would not hold a charge any longer. It would be better if they improved the battery or gave you the option of leaving it plugged in while in use. I will not buy another one..</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the recommendation from a friend who has one and loves it. Now, I too love mine. I was using traditional electric hair clipper which in my opinion was getting the job done, but somewhat cumbersome and messy. With the style and contour of the Remington clipper the process is much quicker and less messy, although cleaning the blade is  a little more frequent w/ the provided cleaning brush during use, but an effective product nonetheless. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Charges very quickly and does a really great job - great value, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase. Easy to clean and is lightweight to use.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.  Easy to use.  Long battery charge.  Excellent for those of us with thinning hair or balding or if you have a cut that is even all over.  Can also be used to cut hair at different lengths and blend in the different lengths.  Cut my hair twice and my three year old&#x27;s once.  Paid for itself after these three cuts.  Excellent for touch up or maintenance cut.  A storage bag or container supplied by Remington would be nice.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Conceptually the Remington Short Cut Clipper is ingenious and is a marvel. However, it pales in relative performance compared to the Wahl 5 Star Series Balding Clipper (Model 8100) that is also available for purchase on Amazon at these links:    [[ASIN:B000VVT94G WAHL BALDING CLIPPER #8110]]  [[ASIN:B0019QD8PI Wahl 5 Star Balding Clipper Kit]]  [[ASIN:B0012KWUQE WAHL Balding Clipper (Model:8110)]]    I have used both the Wahl and the Remington so I am able to make a direct comparison. Being cordless, the Remington Short Cut is underpowered compared to the Wahl 8100, which also happens to have powerful motor that is twice the speed of typical pivot motor clippers. This typically means that if the objective is to shave a head bald, the Wahl 8100 would be able to do it faster and better. However, the Wahl is slightly more expensive and one typically cannot cut your own hair with it; someone else will have to cut/clip your hair although it will typically take a mere 5 minutes or at most 10 minutes.    Overall, I have found the Wahl 8100 to be much better than the Remington Short Cut.</li>
    <li> This is my third one. These typically last a year!</li>
    <li> I love this clipper...have been using it for some years now and keep buying it again and again...have not found another clipper in shops that can shave my head as well and easily as this one..</li>
    <li> Really works as advertised, very pleased!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is so cool! I don&#x27;t use it on my head.  I have been trimming my body hair, legs, chest, arms, etc., for years with regular hair clippers, the worst hour every few months of my life! With the Remington trimmer I can set the depth to one or two and simply rub it over my entire body.  The result is an entire body trim at shaved close or slightly longer.  I recommend this trimmer wholeheartedly.  I can grab this thing at any second and trim the back of my neck or arms, where ever needed.  I like to be trimmed up, looking good and with this product I get just that!</li>
    <li> A great design crippled by a worthless battery. Although it&#x27;s designed very well overall, it appears that the accountants specified the absolute cheapest battery possible. After one or two uses, it no longer holds a charge. You can&#x27;t swap the battery for a better one, nor can you run the clipper directly from a wall outlet -- resulting in yet another toxic addition to the solid waste stream because that&#x27;s where these units will quickly end up.  For probably the cost of a few cents for a better battery, Remington has sullied their name and lost legions of customers forever.  AVOID  UPDATE March 16, 2015-------------------------------------------  Apparently after reading my original review here, Remington customer service contacted me and sent me a replacement. I&#x27;ll update this review, if needed, but only after I&#x27;ve had a chance to use the replacement unit a few times. Apparently, there&#x27;s a manufacturer&#x27;s code that&#x27;s visible when you slide open the detail trimmer. Kudos to Remington for sending me a replacement, but I have no reason to believe that the battery on this one is any better (Remington said nothing about a re-engineered battery). So, my review will stand as-is for now.  If you had your battery fail prematurely, I encourage you to send it back to Amazon for a refund, or if over 30 days ask Remington for a replacement. One can only wonder at how many of these were junked prematurely due to the bad batteries used, and at what $$$ cost to the customers and to the environment.</li>
    <li> This is my second on and the siplicity is great.  The battery on the old one would not charge, so it was time for a new one.  Works great and the ergonomic makes it easy to hold and use.  Plus a 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> The only way I can cut my hair without looking like I was buzzed by a drunk barber.</li>
    <li> Very well made and easy to use!</li>
    <li> fits well in the hand</li>
    <li> i threw it in the trash after guard slipped and cut hair to scalp... it evened up my hair pretty well after you did not need the guard...</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very convenient and efficient. Now i can have a hair-cut by myself. Strongly recommended!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Cuts great!!!</li>
    <li> Seller did a great job with shipping and was correct with the word as new.    However because it is 3 years old...the rechargeable batteries are defective and the product will not hold a charge.    I loved the product and my first one also went down and I just figured that it broke.    So I wanted a replacement and as it turns out the product batteries are gone!!!!    Do not BUY...PRODUCT IS EXPIRED AND REMINGTON WILL NOT FIX IT AND THEY COULD CARE LESS.    This is the truth.  Remington is a poor company not to inform the public that this is the case.    Yet another company that has very poor customer service.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use. I thought the battery wasn&#x27;t holding a charge. It would slow down in just a couple of minutes of use and die within about ten minutes. It turns out it just needed to be cleaned. Once you clear the clippings, it goes right back to full power, lasts for up to an hour. I&#x27;ve used it for over two years. It&#x27;s rinseable so cleaning is quick and easy.</li>
    <li> This product is a great idea and works really well. I can get a very close head shave easily.  The battery however is NOT good.  After a month it would not recharge.  Amazon replaced the product but I&#x27;ve only had the new one for a month...we\\&quot;ll see.</li>
    <li> My husband tried using this when his hair was over 1\\&quot; long and it did not do a good job. It cut in some areas and not in others - I had to even it out with my haircutting scissors, which sort of defeated the purpose. We have yet to try it now that his hair is shorter. That&#x27;s where it will really count!</li>
    <li> Terrible on the sides of the head. Not what I expected or was looking for.</li>
    <li> Had bought one, it died&lt;br /&gt;Bought anorher.. it died&lt;br /&gt;worked well while it held a charge&lt;br /&gt;But it stopped holding a charge</li>
    <li> For those of us that are challenged in the hair department this little clipper is GREAT! I&#x27;m finally coming to terms with the bald spot so I like a short hair cut. The Remington clipper does exactly what it says cuts well, (watch the video and read the directions) and has in one month saved me $25.00 in haircut fees.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few months now and it gives a very even cut.  Beware that the traditional numbers like a 1 with the balding comb are pretty much like having no guard.  I suggest if you don&#x27;t want it really short you try a long setting first.</li>
    <li> I love the product, i no longer go to the salon for hair cut as i now do it myself. I highly recommend the product</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer in March 2012. I read the reviews and noted several that said the battery doesn&#x27;t last. Well, it&#x27;s September 2013 and tonight I have half a haircut because the fully charged battery didn&#x27;t make it through my haircut. I&#x27;m balding and keep my hair very short, so it&#x27;s not like I was putting the thing through a tough outing. I have been noticing a decrease in power for a few months now, but kept ignoring it. It did a great job while it lasted, but I would expect a product to last longer than this one did.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning for some time now and I feel I look better if I take it all off.  Shaving it off can be a hassle, especially if you haven&#x27;t done it for a while.  At it&#x27;s closest setting, this clipper allows me to easily and comfortably cut my hair so short that it almost looks like it&#x27;s been shaved.  This clipper is also great for trimming my beard and mustache, making it easy to clip all the hairs to the same length.    CONS:  This is the second time I have purchased these clippers.  The first unit I purchased started having trouble taking/maintaining a usable charge after about 18 months of use.  But these clippers are reasonably priced and do so much better than other clippers/trimmers I have tried that I decided I had to get a second set.  I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Great hair cutter,very easy to use and easy to clean. Was tired of barber shop cuts because I have a large area of sparse hair and with this cutter I can even do my own due to the adjustments and curve.</li>
    <li> The clipper performed well within expectations.&lt;br /&gt;The motor feels rather powerful.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping that it will last for at least a year.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it came in brand new in the box.  It was defective and did not work.  I never even used it.  I sent this product back as per the instructions back to the manufacter.  I followed the instructions and it&#x27;s been a month and I have not received the product back and no type of correspondence.  I sent it from Fed Ex with a tracking number and confirmed it&#x27;s arrival.    Normally I send it back to the vendor or the company that sold it, however, the warranty was specific that all defective products back to the manufacturer.    From Mr. Lost my money.</li>
    <li> So far, I love it.  It does all that was promised.  If you like your hair short, this is a great, convienient method.  Cuts to about a eighth of an inch.</li>
    <li> I like this cutter very much but be warned it only lasts about 1 year.  I am on my third one.  I keep my hair cut to the shortest level and this is very easy to use.  It rounded so it conforms to your head well.  You can&#x27;t mess up a buzz cut with this trimmer unless you are a little on the slow side.  I am sure I will buy another one when this ones dies and I am sure it will die.  The battery just stops charging after awhile.  It pays for itself quickly though since its cheaper than going to a barber.  If you keep your hair short buy one, just be prepared to purchase it often.</li>
    <li> I used this for about two years and for those who have short hair it gets the job done. Sadly once its battery dies so does the product. It cannot run of the cord and the batteries cannot be replaced. They also can&#x27;t be thrown into the trash and to properly dispose of them I had to open the device and CUT out the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product with a flaw. Still considering how much money I saved using this as opposed to going to the barber it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> The battery is not rechargeable.  The electric charge of the 12 times I still can not use it.  really suck</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic and the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and eventually died.  I regularly buzz my hair down to the minimum, so I took off the comb, so it would also get jammed all the time.  Still, it lasted 2 years or so.</li>
    <li> The main gripe on this clipper is its limited battery. Given the difficulty of disassembly, desolder and replacement, a legitimate caveat. I found, after solder-sucking the old dead nimh cell, that there are any number of battery upgrades on the market that are in the correct spec range for this unit, priced from 3-10 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not re-solder my new Eneloop battery. Just stretch-taped the contacts to the wires and tacked the thing in place with a bit of sticky gel, then snapped the unit back together. My cost for battery surgery was about 3 bucks and 40 minutes&#x27; labor. It will take 15 minutes next time, now that I know what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for usage, I&#x27;m with the other reviewers. It works well once you settle on a style you can live with and learn to do it right. I&#x27;ve now been a DIY hair cutter for going on a year, and I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll pay someone for another haircut unless this tool or one like it becomes unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries are no longer a limiting factor. Mechanically my year-old Shortcut works pretty much like it did new. When it dies I&#x27;ll happily buy another just like it.</li>
    <li> If your hair never gets past 1/2 inch, then this product is for you. Otherwise, it simply doesn&#x27;t work. If your hair is 1 inch or longer, forget about using this device. You can drag it across your head for half an hour and hardly see the difference, other than the unevenness it causes. What&#x27;s more, even though I left it charging for three days, the thing only ran for 10-15 minutes before the charge ran out.    I could go on, but basically, this product does not work and is a rip-off. Save your money and spend it on haircuts at the barber instead.</li>
    <li> The instructions need to be more detailed. Good thing I don&#x27;t have much hair, it sounds like the battery is running down prematurely.</li>
    <li> I purchased the first one and stopped holding a charge after about 1 year.  The second one lasted about 9 months and I contacted Remmington and they replaced it with another one that lasted about the same.  I just purchased another one because there isn&#x27;t another clipper that is as wide as this one.  It works fine for up to a year, but then just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge after that.  I would charge it until the blue light goes off and in the middle of my hair cut, it would stop.  I would have to keep on turning on and off the switch to get through cutting my hair.  I do maintenance after every cut by rinsing, blowing the hair out and re oiling it and nothing ever works.  I guess it&#x27;s still worth it since a haircut cost a minimum of $15 and I cut my hair every 3 weeks.  in one year I save about $250 plus my time and gas to go to the barber.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year, and it worked great until the battery died. It does not operate while plugged in, which makes it useless once the battery wears out and no longer retains a charge, which happened to me after about a year.  It is not washable for a reason -- water will cause it to rust, especially around where the power cord plugs in. A clipper should at least be water resistant if not totally dunkable if you keep it in a moist environment such as a foggy shower room, or if you use water to wash the the cutter blade, which is the fastest way to clean it when it gets clogged, because some will unavoidably splash onto the rest of the device.  Loved it while it worked, but now that I&#x27;m ordering a replacement, I am looking at alternatives.</li>
    <li> Does a good job, it hurts my skin a bit and I am used to cut my hair constantly. Also, the battery could be better but still manages to cut my hair about 3 or maybe 4 times, but I am always afraid to be left with half of my hair gone and the other half still there. So far, it has not happen. The extra trimmer that pops out is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work that well on my flat top, but it can&#x27;t be beat for a convienent way to trim body hair. Fast and easy to use. Much better than my dedicated trimmer, which is now in a box in the attic...</li>
    <li> I already used this machine three times to maintain my clean bald look.  At a barber that would of been $30 already with a decent tip.  The machine already paid itself already within a month and a half.  It feels cheap, and takes a while to even out the hair.  Takes me around 10 minutes per use, which is tolerable.  Even if this thing breaks in a year, or battery dies out, it&#x27;s still worth the purchase.  So cheap to replace.</li>
    <li> A very cool tool.  It does just what it says it does.  Cutting your hair, accuratly and well, is as easy as brushing your hair.  Anyone who wears their hair very short, should have one.</li>
    <li> Sadly, I had to return this product. I bought it to cut my son&#x27;s hair, which he has always maintained in a buzz cut. The product gave a very uneven cut in length and did not hold a charge long enough to complete the cut and trim around the ears, hairline etc. Essentially had to do the cut over 2 days due to the low charge even though I had fully charged the product for 24 hours prior to starting. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> ... this was the third one over the few years I had to purchase for my husband. It works great and is easy to use but doesn&#x27;t last that long, dies out for some reason after awhile... loses the power and battery starts dying fast. After awhile won&#x27;t do the magic anymore. Until then, awesome and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The Remington Short Cut has saved me a great deal of money in the last 2 years.  It is easy to use, cuts evenly, and is easy to clean and maintain.  It pays for itself in about the first 2 haircuts.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Amazon just delivered a lifetime of haircuts for under $30!  I figured it was a reasonable gamble for anyone who keeps his hair shorter, and it&#x27;s a winner.  The Short Cut may not work well on longer, thicker manes, but my hair is thinning, fine, and receding.  A barber would extract $15 for what this trimmer accomplished in ten minutes with no gouges or ridges.  If you&#x27;re dextrous enough to comb your hair, you&#x27;re capable of cutting it with this gadget.  It&#x27;s well designed, perfectly functional, and a great time/money saver.</li>
    <li> I go to a barber shop and pay $15.00 everytime and thanks to the Remington Short Cut Clipper I can now do my haircut myself and it looks perfect and I don&#x27;t need to leave my home.  I would say anyone who likes short hair in the summer this is a must have item.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;Works like it says; I have not gone to the barber since I purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;After weekly use, still performs well, motor has not weakened and nothing has broken.</li>
    <li> I was paying $17 plus a $5 tip every 3 weeks on average ($22), I really liked the idea of saving close to $400 a year on haircuts. Not to mention the timing required to go to the barber at inconvenient times.  The device does a very very good job of what it is made for, an all over/same length haircut. I have to admit I really like the look and the ease of care of my head! I get out of the shower, dry my head with a towel, and I&#x27;m done! I wear a hat, and no hat head! I ride my motorcycle with a helmet, no helmet head. I ride without a helmet (yeah yeah I know) but no hair standing straight up in the air. It is just such a nice feeling to not worry about your hair, like ever!  As far as the battery. I would recommend to fully charge it before first use, then it is a good idea to fully run the device down to nothing, and then recharge it. And then after each subsequent haircut, just let the thing run out and then fully charge again. Many device batteries will die if not used for a month or so. So far mine is trucking along just fine by completing the process above.  My thoughts on using the device: After a few passes on your head you&#x27;ll want to just smack in on the palm of your hand to get the hair out of it, and maybe just pop the comb out and blow on the blades. Use the little brush to brush it for like 10 seconds or so when you are done.  ***Update: It is now June 23, 2014. I have cut my own hair 18 times (at $22 a cut I&#x27;ve now saved $396 in haircuts). My battery is still running strong by letting it run out completely after every cut and then letting it charge fully every time immediately after use.  ***Update: June 2, 2015. The unit is still running and the battery is just fine. I will note though, as others have said on here that the battery has always taken a long time to charge. But, as far as usage battery life, I have not noticed a decrease at all over a year now.  ***Update: June 11, 2016. LOL, I must get the urge to write Amazon reviews every June apparently :P. I was writing some reviews on new things I bought and decided to update this one again. It has been over 2 years now and the thing still cuts and runs like a champ. I have had zero battery issues, and the unit still cuts my hair just as I need it to almost weekly now. I have learned a technique to use this just on the top of my head and then use regular clippers to &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34; the sides of my head for a more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; haircut. Like anything, practice makes perfect. Two years in and I actually look forward to listening to a podcast and cutting my hair. Perfect cut for me everytime. I get a haircut whenever I want. And I&#x27;ve saved a TON of money over the years which will only continue forward :). Whenever this thing does finally die I will be buying another one pronto as this is a must for me personally.probably take you awhile, subsequent cuts will go very quickly, it&#x27;s actually kind of fun I hate to admit it. Anyway, that&#x27;s it, hope this helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: It is now June 23, 2014. I have cut my own hair 18 times (at $22 a cut I&#x27;ve now saved $396 in haircuts). My battery is still running strong by letting it run out completely after every cut and then letting it charge fully every time immediately after use. Others have brought up a good point to remember to oil the unit every now and then as well. I&#x27;ve only oiled mine once so far, I should probably do more often. I now cut on level 1 and have a goatee. Everyone just knows me how I look currently. I still love the ease of this style and am considering trying the balding comb on level 1 just to see what it is like ;). In reading my old review, I do find that I use a beard trimmer behind the ears and at the nape of my neck as this unit does seem to leave longer hairs there (didn&#x27;t notice it the first few cuts). But on the plus side, this thing trims my goatee faster than any other trimmer I own (including the beard trimmer LOL). I still rate this thing 5 stars and am still extremely happy with my purchase. It is just second nature to cut my own hair now. Like anything else, it took a few times to figure out exactly how you like to do it. Just be brave and keep trying :). I just wanted to take a moment to update my review.</li>
    <li> A great product for self haircuts. It&#x27;s cheap, easy to handle and gives professional results. I selected a #2 blade and shaved my head. The process took 5 minutes and was comfortable. Four stars! Five stars if it collected discarded hair.</li>
    <li> As part of the Amazon Vine program, I recently received a review unit of the Remington Short Cut Clipper.  Being somewhat \\&quot;follicly challenged\\&quot;, I thought this might be a quick and easy way to keep my hair trimmed to its shorter length without having to beg and plead for the wife to give me a hair cut.  Generally speaking, it works pretty well.  I probably should have started out with a setting of 2 rather than 1.5, as 1.5 is quite a bit shorter than I normally go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea here is that you can cut your hair with the same motions you&#x27;d use to brush it.  The cutting head is curved, so you have more surface contact as you move across your hair.  There&#x27;s less of a chance for gouges and bald spots.  There&#x27;s also a pop-out trimmer on the top that you can use to get hairlines cut properly.  After the initial charge, I started brushing away to see what would happen.  In the course of about five minutes, I was the proud owner of a haircut that wouldn&#x27;t be out of place on a Marine base after six weeks of basic training.  My wife came in and went over a few places where I hadn&#x27;t gotten the same level of cut and/or couldn&#x27;t see.  We both agreed that her hair cuts are better using a trimmer with a #2 attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it is tailored for the short-all-over hair styles, and it works well in that niche.  It&#x27;s best to make sure you&#x27;re standing over a sink or on a towel to catch some of the hair that falls.  The style of the attachment does catch a fair amount of the hair, and you can simply pop it off to empty it out every couple of minutes.  On the down side, it can leave some uneven patches on the shorter settings if you don&#x27;t happen to have a perfectly spherical noggin.  I have a couple of small bumps on my head that have less hair than the surrounding territory now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t replace my wife&#x27;s efforts, as her results are better.  But with a higher length setting, this could be ideal for those 3rd week touch-ups to keep from waking up with strange parts in my hair.  And if you&#x27;re the type that goes for the nearly bald/razor stubble look, then this would be ideal for getting and keeping your hair (or lack thereof) at that perfect length.ts in my hair.  And if you&#x27;re the type that goes for the nearly bald/razor stubble look, then this would be ideal for getting and keeping your hair (or lack thereof) at that perfect length.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well my first haircut turned out.  Never having cut my own hair before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what would happen.  I purposefully cut my hair on a Saturday morning so I could still make it to my barber if I ended up butchering my hair.  Instead I got a haircut that doesn&#x27;t look that much different than what I would have paid $28 for.      As the manual recommends, I started out with a longer setting and then worked my way down.  I ended up using the 1 1/2 setting for the sides and back of my head and 3 for the top.  This yields an extremely short haircut on the sides and back with just a little bit of hair on top of the head.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of friends look at my haircut so far and neither of them could tell it was done by myself at home until I told them so.    My only real complaint is what others have mentioned:  The sideburn trimmer doesn&#x27;t work that well.  I ended up using a small pair of scissors to clean up the hairline around my ears.  Because it&#x27;s really difficult to hold the clipper at the correct angle to make a clean line at the back of one&#x27;s own head, I ended up using my Body Groomer for that.    All in all, this is a good product that will pay for itself in just a haircut or two.</li>
    <li> I have bought so many different clippers for my husband and this is by far the best one for us.He likes to keep his hair very short and these clippers makes that so easy!Unlike other clippers we have tried,this one is the best if you need to cut your hair by yourself.My husband can get a very even nice cut alone with these clippers whereas with other clippers I always had to clip the back of his neck and around his ears.It is much much faster than traditional style clippers with all the attatchments and my husband uses it every few days and is done in a couple of minutes.I highly reccomend these clippers if you like a very short cut and don&#x27;t have a lot of extra time.</li>
    <li> This is a very sweet little unit. My mother is a professional hairstylist and has cut my hair all my life (44yr). Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t get to see her as often as I&#x27;d like anymore and since I usually keep a short haircut I started to look for a product that could maintain my haircut. A little searching on the &#x27;net yielded this beauty.   This unit does exactly what it advertises. I use a middle setting every week or so and my hair it cut to perfection for me. I also have a mustache and small beard and am able to keep it just as closely trimmed and neat with the Remington ShortCut.    Yes, it does take an overnight charge to get it working initially, but I can cut my hair several times on one charge and have never had it quit while I was in the middle of a cut.   My wife and mother have both commented on how good of a job the unit does to keep and maintain my haircut. It also is wonderful for trimming your neck below the hairline. Just set it to the lowest setting and that neckhair is gone.    The little trimmer that is on the top of the unit is neat for trimming the hair around your ears and also trimming up the corners of my beard.   All in all, a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair at home for over 14 years now.  He has fine, soft, silky hair on the sides and the back but unfortunately has a very deep receding hairline and not much hair on top (male pattern baldness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His hair was getting shaggy around his ears and the back of his neck so I decided to test the Remington Short Cut Clipper by giving him a touch-up haircut.  As per the instructions, I removed the balding comb that was attached and replaced it with the normal clipper comb. Then I dialed the length to setting 4 and started in.  The Clipper&#x27;s curved blade worked easily and smoothly but I couldn&#x27;t see much difference in the hair length.  I dialed the setting to 2 and went over the back and sides of his head again.  It was quite easy and light to use and I really liked that it operated smoothly and fairly quietly.  His hair was evened out and looked really nice.  The only problem was that he still had a lot of little neck hairs and the hairline at the back of his neck needed to be evened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pushed the button to bring out the little detail blade and tried it on the back of his neck.  That did not work well at all.  I really couldn&#x27;t see that it was doing much good.  As a matter of fact, it seemed to be pulling rather than shaving.  We tried it a bit longer but it just wasn&#x27;t working well there and Dave was losing patience with all the pulling...even though, I swear, I was trying to be very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pushed the button again to retract the little detail blade and pulled off the comb attachment from the shaver.  That worked superbly!  Dave said it felt fine and there was no pulling or gouging.  It shaved the little neck hairs very closely and the back of his neck looked and felt great.  It only took about 30 seconds to even up the neck line and clean up the neck hairs.  Success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said earlier, there is not a lot on top to work with and since this was just a touchup haircut, anyway, I didn&#x27;t need to cut anything there today.  He prefers to keep his comb-over hair on top and since the balding comb actually gives a very close buzz cut I doubt that we will ever be using that particular attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This haircutter was lightweight and felt good in my hand.  The curved blade made it very easy to cut hair evenly.  I also like the fact that it is much less noisy than the electric [[ASIN:B000FRWNLW Vidal Sasson VSCL802 10-Piece Haircutting Kit]] that we have been using for several years now.  It was very nice not having a cord to drag around, too. The Remington Short Cut Clipper comes with a handy little brush so the clipper clean-up was easy.  I just brushed the cut hair away from the blade.  It also comes with a small bottle of oil so re-lubing the blade is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole shaver can be rinsed under water.  The directions recommend re-lubing the blade after doing that.  I felt that for this first haircut just brushing off the blade worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest pet peeve about Remington Short Cut Clipper is that once you unpack it from the box there is no easy way to keep all the pieces organized and together.  I think a plastic storage case where all the pieces had a place would have been wonderful.  At the least, I think some sort of a soft cloth storage bag with a draw string opening should have been included.  I currently have mine stored in a freezer zip lock bag.  It is fine for now but I am careful with it since there is no added protection for the shaver or accessories.  The other thing that disappointed me was that it takes 14-16 hours to get a full charge into the unit.  It will not operate while it is charging, either.  The charge light is quite a bright blue.  While it was charging on the bathroom counter it really did double as a quite bright nightlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this product 3 stars. In summary,it&#x27;s easy to use and cuts hair evenly and smoothly but I do not like the detail blade - it pulled rather than shavedand I think it could easily cut tender ears or the skin on the back of the neck. The curvature of the main blade worked very well and made it very easy to trim hair.  It&#x27;s relatively quiet to operate but there is nothing provided in the box to keep all the pieces and parts organized and together. And finally, it takes a long time to charge up.in on the back of the neck. The curvature of the main blade worked very well and made it very easy to trim hair.

    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years, It makes shaving  close to the scalp a breeze, the blade covers more area than the rest &amp; safer to use.&lt;br /&gt;The charge on my previous clipper did not hold after a while though.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a great design that makes it incredibly easy to use. So much so that I bought a second after the battery on my first died after 6 months. The battery on the new one lasted one week. Seriously. It died after a week. Move on and buy something that works.</li>
    <li> 8 years I&#x27;ve been using this clipper, They last about 2 years....love the cut and the HUGE money saver from going to the barber</li>
    <li> I bought my first one and it broke within a few months. I called Remington and they shipped me a new one quickly. My second unit still works, but I lost the charger in a relocation. In pricing a replacement charger, it was much easier and even cheaper to by a whole new unit. Now I have 2 functioning units and 1 charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is designed for folks that cut their hair short - 1,2,3 blade. I&#x27;m basically bald and use this to cropped it close - #1 about once per week. It gives you an almost shaved look without the razor. This is not something for styling or longer cuts. I recommend this for the guy that likes something they can do themselves easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> This was a little more work to figure out than I thought it would be and my son had a moment or two of panic. It finally worked, but his haircut wasn&#x27;t what we had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Basically, this is a portable, hand-held Flowbee that has only 4 settings: short, very short, very very short, and bald. The longest setting is supposed to be about an inch, but a half-inch would be more like it. And that&#x27;s with the standard brush attachment.  There&#x27;s also a \\&quot;shaved head\\&quot; attachment if you want a truly bald head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carefully read the other reviews before ordering this unit.  I had mixed feelings about what I expected, but I&#x27;ve been happily surprised at what I received. It seems to work fine, although the \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; created by the machine is very weak.  While running the unit over your head, you&#x27;ll feel a constant shower of little tiny hair particles raining down on your head, neck, and shoulders. There is just enough suction to make a pad of hair coat the inside of the \\&quot;brush\\&quot; so that you have to clean it out often.  But that&#x27;s my only complaint, and frankly, it&#x27;s not much of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this one breaks or wears out, I&#x27;ll probably order another one.  And from me, that&#x27;s the biggest compliment anything is likely to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional note:  I&#x27;ve used this unit for awhile now, and I still have no other complaints.  However, I&#x27;ve discovered that you have to use it every few days (once or twice a week, depending on your rate of hair growth), or it gives a choppy response.  That&#x27;s because the unit is designed to \\&quot;keep\\&quot; your hair short, not \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it short.  If your hair grows more than a quarter-inch or so, it just won&#x27;t function the way you&#x27;d wish.</li>
    <li> I loved the this trimmer when the battery actually worked.  However, it lasted maybe 6 months and then would no longer hold a charge.  It cannot run while plugged in.  READ REVIEWS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE OWNED IT AT LEAST 6 MONTHS.  I thought it used to be a five star trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this clipper for over 2 years. It cuts my hair perfectly. However, I am on my 2nd one now. The battery does eventually go out, but who cares it&#x27;s only 30 bucks. I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much money this clipper has saved me in 2 years. All Remington has to do is improve the battery (maybe charge more for the clipper) and they will have a real winner in my opinion.</li>
    <li> makes cutting my hair a lot eaiser without worring about a cord to get in ur way i realy like the product</li>
    <li> I ordered this clipper to keep my close to the scalp hair at its set height and to avoid paying barber fees for a quick trim.  This clipper works great for very short hair, use it regulary and have had zero problems. Very Satisfied. Best for those who want a nearly bald look.  Ease of use is also a great selling point on this item, use just like a brush.</li>
    <li> Very loud slow trimmer</li>
    <li> Make sure you keep blades oiled and free of hair (clean it and keep it oiled).  If you don&#x27;t the clipper will break from friction related stress.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I do keep my hair short in length and this trimmer cuts evenly when you go back and forth motion. It does cut in either direction. The negative is that it must be fully charged and will not work with the cord attached. You can remove cutter guide and rinse for easy cleaning. My wife outlines my hair with a Wahl cordless trimmer after I cut it with the Remington so there is no need to go to the barber which saves you money.</li>
    <li> This clipper worked flawlessly ... until it died! Apparently, this issue has been reported by others who have owned it for a while. Sure it&#x27;s cheap and will save you few trips to the barber ... still, it would be nice if the company could fix this issue instead of ignoring it for so long. Buyers need to be aware of the issue that the rechargeable battery will die after only few recharges.</li>
    <li> Well, I checked out other reviews for this product and, sure enough, many others have the same problem: the battery doesn&#x27;t keep a charge after a short time. I&#x27;d have to consider myself lucky, though. I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years and only recently has it been failing to charge up. It&#x27;s too bad because, unlike some other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;ve been able to give myself pretty good haircuts with this thing; in that respect it works great (Oh,incidentally for those having trouble with the back and sides of their heads--try using a hand-held mirror in front of you while standing in front of a regular mirror; I found that works well). I would hope that Remington has improved the quality since I first bought it because I&#x27;d sure like to get a newer, better one. They need to appreciate that if they want repeat business they need to make a quality product!</li>
    <li> Was able to only use once before the battery gave out. Now when I turn it on the battery will last 30 seconds at the most. Can no longer use.</li>
    <li> I shave my head about every week and i wanted something to cut close and not rip my head to shreads. This worked great i had no problems. It was easy to clean. It stayed sharp but then right out of the blue the battery took a crap and now i cant even use it because it dies. It was great while it lasted. It would be 5/5 if you could replace the battery or it would last. But even tho it is a good deal i really dont want to replace it every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I think the design of this clipper is extraordinary, but after only a few uses it died.  It would not hold a charge. The charging lights failed to work and eventually would hold a charge for only a few minutes.  I bought another one and it did the same thing.  I opened up the clipper and found that the solders were flimsy and the wires were not attached sufficiently.  VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR A GREAT DESIGN.  Remington should know better.  I have a triple head shaver and it is far inferior to Norelco products of like design.</li>
    <li> Works great but really cut short.</li>
    <li> May be ok for thinner hair but bogs down and pulls when cutting thick hair. Also cuts very uneven you have to go over the hair many times and it is almost impossible to get the hair one length.</li>
    <li> Really great product!!!  if you want to keep your hair cut fine all the time, this product can be helpful for you.</li>
    <li> This product is great - not that you can really save money that you&#x27;d spend on a barber. You will defn. reduce the number of times you end up going to a barber over a longer duration.   Also, I don&#x27;t let my hair grow wild anymore. Trim once every week instead of going to the barber every 3 weeks.    Great product.   Pros:   Works in both directions  DIY  Cons:   The power-on button is misplaced. a firm grip holding the trimmer can switch it on or off. But not difficult to get used to.   Side-burn trimmer can hurt the skin</li>
    <li> They wanted to make a clipper that follows the head curve. It&#x27;s an awful idea when the clipper does a really poor job. My wife bought me this clipper as a gift. I tried it right away. Within 5 minutes of going back and forth on the same area, and seeing only a few hairs being cut, I told my wife: \\&quot;your gift suck...I don&#x27;t want it\\&quot;... seriously,this product is a joke.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this clipper, it worked great the first time I used it (and I loved it)I thought I could finely cut my own hair and save $10.00 a cut. But the next time I wanted to cut my hair I plugged it in and nothing would not charge, no lights nothing dead and I&#x27;m not good on computers so I can&#x27;t find out how to send it back or even if I can, probable warranty is up shipped 3-06-2012 and now it&#x27;s dead on 4-30-2012 SO KEEP YOUR MONEY in your pocket .</li>
    <li> Good everyday head shaver. It does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought one about three years ago and have used it every 3-4 days since. Recently, I thought it had become jammed and ordered a new one. While waiting for Amazon&#x27;s great Super Saver shipping, I thoroughly cleaned the \\&quot;broken one\\&quot; again and oiled it a couple of times. After that, it sprang back to life and works fine; so I will save it for a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it clean and oiled weekly and it will give you over $6,000 in haircuts without leaving your home and waiting in line while the barber tells every dirty story and joke he has ever heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review updated 10/28/2012: Well I got the new one and after using it about 10 times, it failed to charge AT ALL. I kept it clean and oiled, but the problem was apparently electrical because the motor wouldn&#x27;t even humm as the first one did when jammed up. Amazon CS suggested I contact Remington, which I did and happily paid the $9 to ship it to them for a replacement. In the meantime, I went back to my original one and it kept doing the job. Now that I have received the replacement, I will give it a go and report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend the product because when it works, it is GREAT for us simi-bald old men, the price is a REAL savings over the barber; and the company honored their guarentee! I will gladly pay $9 every year or so to have Remmington replace any one that stops working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still four stars!</li>
    <li> Great for short hair styles</li>
    <li> I think the idea of having a clipper that contours to the shape of your head is a great idea.  However, I have owned this clipper for 8 months and although I have used it to give myself a crewcut every month, you have to go over your head three or four times to get it even.      To me that is not very userfriendly.  I have been cutting my own hair for the last 5 years and this clipper just dosen&#x27;t cut it.  I love the idea, but it shouldn&#x27;t take this long to make it even.    As I said in my title I really, really, really wanted to like it, but after using it for 8 months now unfortunately I can&#x27;t recommend it.  I gave it two stars because I am able to cut my hair with it, but it shouldn&#x27;t be the chore it is.    For full discolsure, I used to be a professional barber.</li>
    <li> With practice this is good for short length beards and mustaches. I use setting 3 or 4 against the grain followed with setting 2 ,with the grain, and 1.5 on the mustache area. A 1 setting can nick you.</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t live up to its hype. I changed the cutting blade as some else had recommended and set it for 1/2 inch. My hair had been cut the week previous to this, so it was very short. I just wanted to keep it in the shape it was in. After a couple of passes, I saw some hair in the sink and looked carefully in the mirror. There were bald spots along the side and my whole head. It appears that if you don&#x27;t keep the device at a consistent proper angle to your head (very difficult to do), it will cut at different lengths. So it&#x27;s into the garbage and back to the barber I go. It is probable that with experience the outcome would improve, but until then be prepared to look like a monkey with mange. [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut Kit]]</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut well around the ears or sides because it is too big to fit.  Ended up going over it with my regular electric cutter.</li>
    <li> If your head isn&#x27;t perfectly shaped like a bowling ball you may be frustrated with these clippers. It leaves streaks like one other reviewer mentioned. It takes forever to fully charge. If you do decide to buy these I recommend you have a back up plan when the battery dies before your cut is completed.</li>
    <li> Love it from a design and results perspective but it is simply a cheap piece of crap from a quality, fit and finish perspective.  I&#x27;m actually on line looking for something similar that I can purchase that will hold up better.  I&#x27;m willing to pay for it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair trimmer a few weeks ago and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I get the same precision cut each time. It only takes a few minutes with each use and I use it at least once a week. There have been no battery problems; I keep it plugged in between uses. Sometimes it sounds like it&#x27;s winding down just after I&#x27;ve started using it, but then it seems to regain it&#x27;s strength and finish with plenty of power. The first haircut took about 40-minutes or so, just to get it where I liked it. Since then each haircut only takes a few minutes. I&#x27;m now able to keep my hair looking exactly the same all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the fact that I&#x27;m now happy with my hair, I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber anymore. I&#x27;ve always dreaded those trips and put them off as long as possible.</li>
    <li> This is not an all everything clipper. I use it to make sure my cut is even after using a regular clipper. That is what this does best. For that use, I have nothing to complain about. It catches the stray hairs that I miss and provides an even nice clip. Don&#x27;t think of this as your main clipper but as your finisher and you will be happy with the product. I knocked it down a star because it sits awkwardly when recharging making it a pain to keep in the sink area. It could use a nice recharging station.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and adjust the length of cut.  Takes a few minutes once a week and his haircut is maintained... done!  Husband likes that he sets the length and it&#x27;s easy and quick.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Comfortable to hold and contours to the shape of your head so you don&#x27;t miss anything.  Very easy to use and clean-up after.</li>
    <li> This is a must buy for anyone who likes their hair short and neat at all times.  This saves money and its so easy to use.  My son likes his hair very short and and now he can always look neat n clean.  He said it is so easy and fast.  Now I going to order one for my older son who saw how fast his brother did it. The angle on the unit made it extra easy and fast to get the even cut he usually pays $20 + tip for.  He even uses it for his mustache and beard. Great buy at a even Great price.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these trimmers about a year ago and so far here are my observations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Consistent length trimming when trimming your won hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Length wheel that locks at the desired length so you don&#x27;t accidentally cut it too short because it inadvertently clicked to a shorter position. (Be sure it&#x27;s locked firmly into the desired length before trimming.)&lt;br /&gt;- Two length attachments with further variable length achievable with the locking adjustment wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It is safe to say that EVERY single time I use this thing I accidentally turn it off or on because they (stupidly) put the on/off button on a handling surface. (My dang Galaxy S3 does this also b/c the power button sits where you hold the device. I hate that.)&lt;br /&gt;- Battery consistency is flaky. Not sure if it&#x27;s the individual one I bought or all of the batteries in these trimmers are flaky. I turn it on, after 20-30 seconds it slows down to a low trim speed.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;d actually like a slightly longer trim gate for the top of my head, which I like a little longer. Can&#x27;t win them all.&lt;br /&gt;- The trim teeth are at an angle I would guess trims that well. It&#x27;s at a 90 degree angle to your scalp when I would have faced the teeth toward the incoming hair. A 90 degree angle probably makes it possible to move the trimmer in two directions to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good purchase and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;As a military guy, short hair is the rule but I don&#x27;t want to have to go get a haircut every week or two.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easier just to do it yourself. (A practice I got good at in Afghanistan where there weren&#x27;t any barbers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations to the Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;- Move the power button to where it belongs, down on the end where you plug it in and out of the place where fingers are supposed to press&lt;br /&gt;- Beef up the battery so it lasts at least 10 minutes of cut time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-on Comment&lt;br /&gt;- I tried some razor oil which seemed to help with the battery problem. Probably should have tried that earlier but it helpsoil which seemed to help with the battery problem. Probably should have tried that earlier but it helps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for almost 6 months now and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. No fuss and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the battery: I suspect that this device uses Nickel Cadmium batteries. Because of this, I make sure to fully discharge it before my next charge (that is, the low battery indicator lights up AND the clipper turns off a couple seconds after I try to turn it on). If I don&#x27;t do this, my clipper&#x27;s battery will experience the \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; which is inherent in nickel cadmium (or similar) based batteries. I make sure to avoid overcharging it as well as it might experience the \\&quot;lazy effect\\&quot; which is, again, inherent in nickel cadmium batteries.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer stated, these do not accommodate for places where your head is not round such as the sides. I ended up getting it too short on the top and the top edge of the side by going over and over a spot that it wouldn&#x27;t touch. By doing this, the spot it was touching just got way too short while the spots on either side of it did not. My head shape does not conform exactly to the curve of the blades and that means it will not cut evenly. It does sound like a good idea in a product but that&#x27;s all it is; marketing. I could try to return it to the manufacturer but it&#x27;s just not worth my time.  Bottom line is I took a gamble with this one and lost. I went with a traditional clipper from Wahl that have a cord and not batteries so I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging. They work much better than this and cost about the same.</li>
    <li> I use it on my husbands hair in between major hair cuts, it helps cut down the amount of hair cuts he needs and keeps his hair looking neat.</li>
    <li> I am very happy I invested in this clipper. I have my head shaved a barber every week for about $10.00 a shot and for less than a $40.00 purchase, I am able to shave my head every week. The clippers have already payed for themselves.  It is easy to adjust and clean and no nicks and cuts on my scalp. I would highly recommend this clipper to anyone that likes a close clip or is balding and wants the convienience on clipping their hair without spending the time or money going to a barber again.</li>
    <li> This unit would be very nice if it had some NiMH batteries.  The NiCads that it now has can&#x27;t hold a charge for longer than a few minutes, and there is no rectifier circuit by-pass to allow on-line running.  I&#x27;d pay double the price if it had those features.  As it is, getting burnt once is enough for me.  TIP: To get the most run-time from your unit, be sure to clean often as per manual instructions.  Believe it or not, any little bit of hair caught down in the head increases the current drain dramatically.</li>
    <li> Had less than three months. Used two times. After charging for 24 hours unit lasted for 20 seconds before going DEAD?&lt;br /&gt;Tried to get a refund, guess what? I missed deadline by 30 days.  I am very surprised that Amazon sells this unit, as I heard Wal Mart discontinued sales. Don&#x27;t buy this product. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Works well. Fast process when used to. Leaves stubble height, so not razor smooth -trim height worked well. Problem is with battery charge and life. A lot of times, had weak charge or none at end of life. Replaced with a corded trimmer-miss the curve shape but nice to have power.</li>
    <li> Like many of the one star reviewers here on Amazon, I am extremely disappointed with the durability of the batter pack.  This unit came in and work as advertised.  However, you have to let it charge for nearly over eight hours before you can use it.  After a full charge the unit only lasts for about 30 minutes.  Unfortunately that didn&#x27;t last long.  After about a year or six uses the battery life lasted only half the time.  After only two years the unit has died completely.  What is really upsetting is that I have only used about a dozen times.  Although I guess I did save some money on this product by not going to the barber.  Just realize that you may end up with a half a haircut, which is a little embarrassing if you are going out in public.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for 10 years.  Some times I buzz it and others I go all the way with a bic razor.  Either way it starts with a zero guard buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used various buzz kits including norelco and remington beard trimmers(with the guard removed), and lately the Short Cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;* The wide and curved blade allowed me to buzz my head in 30 seconds on weeks where I kept up with it daily.&lt;br /&gt;* This speed of use made it less of a chore, so I kept up with it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;* The precision trimmer is the proverbial bell and whistle.  Get a real beard trimmer.  Norelco gets my vote today.&lt;br /&gt;* The battery life grows shorter with great haste.  I had to stop using my SCC-100R Short Cut after less than three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final opinion:&lt;br /&gt;* I can not recommend the purchase of this trimmer.  I will not purchase a new one every few months.  My Norelco beard trimmers last years doing double duty as a hair buzzer.</li>
    <li> Does not cut even. Would think with the \\&quot;curve feature\\&quot; that at least the crown of head would be even, but I had tuffs all over (after several passes and size adjusts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Sides... how do you do that, but to try and adjust way short. Same problem. I hate getting items just to through them away. Had to still go and get a Wahl cutter just to finsh this horrible product.(and, threw this away! Great).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, but to be fair, husband uses it a lot. We probably get a good year or more out of it. Good cut, good value.</li>
    <li> This clipper provides everything advertized and more.  I wish I could say the same for this review software. I&#x27;m surprised anybody even bothers to respond.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair short. This item feels as if it was from the future. Magical in a way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it plugged in all the time when I am not using it. The instruction say this is fine because it will not over charge. When it is charging there is a blue light glowing. It feels excellent in my hands. It makes a cut a breeze. It makes the trimming even. It is so convenient I run it through my hair every shower. I never have had to worry about losing power. After I trim my hair there is as much power as when I started the trim. It is also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admire the designer who came up with this design. He/She added a bit to my quality of life. Thanks.</li>
    <li> With a receding hairline and growing bald spot on an inevitable collision course, I recently decided to shave my head. However, my wife I both preferred it when I let my hair grow for a few days, so I was trying to find a way to cut it to that very short length instead of completely shaving it.  I tried a set of clippers at their shortest setting, but it was difficult to get a consistent cut and almost impossible to do by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Remington Short Cut...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and decided to give it a try, and it works great!  I can cut my own hair quickly and easily (although my wife still needs to help with cleaning up at the back of my neck) and the shortest setting (1/8\\&quot;) is the perfect length for me The contoured cutting head fits my head well and resulted in a very uniform length despite a few dents in my skull. It does make an awful mess so I use it in the shower before I turn the water on. Clean up is fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be on the watch for battery issues as it sounds like that&#x27;s the main weakness of this product.  The instructions include steps for removing the batteries prior to disposal, so I may try to use them to do a battery replacement when that becomes necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  It works extremely well and does what other clippers can&#x27;t (at least not as easily).</li>
    <li> This is all I have to say: Used it 2 times, after that it seemed to me that it ran out of battery, plugged it in for about 4 hours with the thingy that it comes with. After that, tried to use it again an it went bruuuunnn, brunnnn a couple of times and stopped again. That&#x27;s all it does now. Judge for yourself</li>
    <li> Excelent, it is a very nice short cut clipper rechargeable, the best is, that it is cordless, it is good and professional. You can be sure, it is great.</li>
    <li> The design of the clipper is flawed in that the blades of the clipper moves back in forth in the vertical direction (think same direction as your hair stands).  So what this means is in order for your hair to actually get cut, the hair has to be pushed into the blades unlike conventional clippers where the clipper is perpendicular to the hair so as the hair just slides into the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there&#x27;s really no good reason for this...they really could have designed it with double horizontal blades (like a T ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the end result is an uneven cut unless you go over your head a million times.  This also means that you will end up with a million tiny pieces of hair because of the way it cuts.  I also had to constantly take off the guard and knock off the hair before it would start cutting again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put up with this only because I didn&#x27;t want to spend more money on another set.  However, since the clippers broke after only a few months, I&#x27;m now in need of another pair of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t worth the time.  I would stay away from these unless they change the cutting blade design. Then I would try them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had two of the same product fail due to a defective on/off switch.  Remington replaced the product both times but required me to pay for shipping/handling.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing a third replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really unhappy with this product.  Purchased it five weeks ago and it is dead as a door nail.  I am really unahppy with Amazon, because although it touts a four year warranty, I can&#x27;t see how I can exchange it for a working model.    This is the first time I am disgusted with Amazon.  Loved the device, for a very brief time, and now am furious that I can&#x27;t get it exchanged for one that works.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy this is.  I just finished my first haircut.  Took me maybe 10 minutes tops.  Did it entirely by myself, and I can&#x27;t say there is any real difference between what I feel and see in the mirror from when the barber did it.  And no one else has noticed any difference or mentioned it. I always told my barber anyway not to shave over the ears and around the back - just at the bottom of my sideburns.    I am delighted I made this purchase.  I would not recommend this to anyone who has hair much longer than a crewcut, however.</li>
    <li> Had trouble charging, the power button would never stay put so the clippers were always turning off in the middle of clipping, the sizer easily gets pushed back in while clipping which means you can end up with some unexpected bald spots, low quality construction. We used this product three times, each use was a disaster.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS REMINGTON SHORT CUT CLIPPER. IT IS EASY TO USE &amp; GIVES YOU A VERY GOOD CUT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CLIPPER.  THE BATTERY LASTED A GOOD FORTY MINUTES. I LIKE THE CHARGER BECAUSE YOU CANNOT OVER CHARGE THE BATTERY/SHUTS OFF WHEN FULLY CHARGED.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers. They&#x27;re curved to conform to your head and the built in guide is adjustable so you can start long and work your way down. Should have gotten them sooner. Looking forward to saving money by not going to the barber.</li>
    <li> Bought this cool curved hair cutter for my husband who is now cutting his hair very short.  He can cut his hair himself now and it having fun doing it.  This is a very nice hairclipper!  Very unique from the others.</li>
    <li> its a great idea, but unfortunately, it doesnt execute as planned.  since the hair on the side and back of your head doesnt stand straight out, it cant reach it unless you shave it really close.</li>
    <li> When they say it is a Short Cut, they are not kidding I had it set at the longest cut and it still cut very short, now that it&#x27;s Winter I think that I will put it up until next Spring. Plus my wife had to help me with the back of my head and neck so that it looked even.</li>
    <li> I like the design and ease of use. The Battery SUCKS!!!!!!! It does not hold a charge very long. I would advise buying a wired model if available.</li>
    <li> My Barber retired and now I give myself haircuts. This works great and saves me a lot of money Thank You for this great tool</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this clipper for about a month ago and used it twice.    The first time, I used the clipper to shorten my hair down to near bald from being about two inches long.  The clipper is extremely weak and has a hard time cutting hair.  I got so frustrated using this thing that I just pulled out my beard trimmer and got the job done in minutes.    The second time I used this clipper was about two weeks after I had cut my hair down to stubble (above paragraph).  My hair at this point was extremely short, but I wanted to bring it back down to stubble level.  Again, the clipper did a terrible job, being very weak and requiring repeated passes to cut hair.  Even then, the hair was getting cut unevenly and leaving patches on certain parts of my head.  I had to break out my beard trimmer again to get the job done.    Bottom line: Save your money, this thing sucks, I get a better haircut using my trusty beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I just received these clippers and I must say that I am completely impressed..for the cost..they are great..added a lil oil turned them on and went to work on my head.The cut was close and complete,no lil strands of hair pokin up..The guard is a slight pain in the ass to remove..as I stated slight..If you like a good clean cut then I recommend these clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had theses clipper for a 15 months now and still work great.</li>
    <li> This would be my solution if it didn&#x27;t have continuing battery issues. I returned one, then returned the replacement, and now the second replacement is starting to have serious problems holding a charge. Unfortunately, I will have to start shopping for an alternative.</li>
    <li> Works great! Bought this product for the second time.</li>
    <li> Works well for a do-it-yourself haircut.</li>
    <li> If you have any bumps on your head, you&#x27;re gonna bet an uneven hair cut with this thing. Good quality material though.</li>
    <li> I have used this 4 times and it is good. My wife has cut my hair for about 40 years and now she can take a break. Thanks for a real good product</li>
    <li> If you like the buzzed-almost-to-the-scalp style, this unit is very nice. Used it 3 or 4 times and it makes quick work of the job. I use it on the lowest possible setting. Gives an even, all-over cut, and does it quickly.. being able to go back-n-forth is great. Lots better than the old style clippers I was using. Wash it out with water. What could be better? I expect the battery to crap out after a year or so, but I&#x27;ll just buy another one.</li>
    <li> Rarely will I ever praise a product, but the Remington Short Cut is that product. It does exactly as advertised and if you like short perfect hair this product does just that in seconds. A barber told me this product is going to put him out of business because short hair is in and I believe him. I have saved a couple of hundred dollars in barber shop cost and it is so easy to use. You actually get better and better everytime you use it. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If you like the patchy, cancer chemotherapy look, you will love this product. It looks good on paper but my experience has been less than satisfactory. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> My ability to cut my hair is lacking on so many levels.  This is a great product if you have one length hair over your entire head.  I have no.  dexterity.  If you have a barber cutting your hair at a 1 all over than this is for you.</li>
    <li> works good for me it&#x27;s my second one and does a good job on my hair.When this one Quits I&#x27;ll buy another one.Cheaper than a barber.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair cutter I have owned in more than forty years of trimming my own bald pate.  The curved design really conforms to the shape of the head.  I am able to get a nice even cut.</li>
    <li> I use it in the shower and wash it off.Does a great job.I bought a second one in case I couldn&#x27;t buy one later if the first one ever breaks.Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I received this item, and was excited for an easier way to cut my own hair. My previous clippers had malfunctioned. I removed these from the package and immediately plugged them in. The blue charge light on the end lit up, so I left it to charge. When I returned, 30 minutes later, there were no lights on on the device, including the charging light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device wouldn&#x27;t function all at. Nothing. I plugged it back in, and the charging light did not come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be safe, I left it plugged in for three more hours. Still nothing. These clippers were DOA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read the other reviews here, but like many people, considered them to be probably edge cases, or user error. Don&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;m not a dull guy, an engineer by trade, and pretty proficient with technology. The manual claims that the device can&#x27;t be overcharged, and I left it to charge sufficiently afterwards, so there&#x27;s no user error on the battery, either. These guys were dead out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, the design is cool (even looking at the non-functional one I have here, I wish it would work. Looks like it&#x27;s be pretty easy to use, and I shave my head twice a week or so - it could be an awesome time saver!) Still, dead is dead. Do yourself a favor, skip the Remington Short Cut Clipper.</li>
    <li> Very inconsistent trimming of hair. I had to toss to make sure I never used again.</li>
    <li> This short hair clipper comes with lots of promises, but when I used this equipment to trim my hair, the result was not what I expected. I thought it would give a uniform haircut but I found that clipping was uneven and at some places it did not clip. Someone who prefers personal grooming and has the experience to use this type of machine may be able to use this a little more effectively. I prefer professional grooming; hence I did not find this equipment very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper also comes with an adjustable guide combo, and trimming attachment that could be used for trimming hair on ear. The machine comes with rechargeable adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. [[ASIN:B00008BNZ4 Wahl 79900N Clip-N-Trim 23-Piece Complete Haircut Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;2.

    <li> remington short-cut easy to use for those with already short hair...handles like a brush and in a few short minutes you have a very professional looking cut...</li>
    <li> I tried this product out on my two year-old son at first.  He had been getting buzz cuts from the Hair Butchery for a while and he basically screamed bloody murder every time we went in there.  I got tired of hearing it and paying good money to do so.  I had also been \\&quot;entertaining\\&quot; the idea of that hairstyle (if it can be called that) for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it on sale and with a rebate which brought the total price down to $19.99.  I got it home and touched up his little punkin head.  I wish I had read the instructions that said the balding comb was attached from the factory.  But other than a little bitty bald spot on the back of his skull, no harm was done.  It actuaally cleaned up his &#x27;do pretty good.  Subsequent uses have honed my skills and he&#x27;s looking pretty sharp if I should say so myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw caution to the wind yesterday and did my own.  I guess it looks OK since my wife didn&#x27;t laugh hysterically or run out of the room when I came downstairs. Feels pretty good now, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat though; take your time. And if you have a full head of hair to start with like I did, be patient and keep at it.  Or you can go one last time to your barber or stylist and tell them it&#x27;s goodbye.  But wait until after they cut your hair...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 15 years... ever since a particularly bad haircut from a barber in 1993.  I don&#x27;t use anything except a standard Conair-type clipper and the trimmer function on the back of my electric razor.  The whole process is a little time consuming and there are many times when I make blind cuts, which is basically using my fingers to determine length while not being able to see any of the action.    When I saw this Remington Short Cut Clipper online I thought I might have stumbled into a perfect solution for my hair cutting needs.  The design is very innovative, allowing for cutting with either hand that goes more quickly because the blades are wider and they&#x27;re shaped to follow the contour of the head.    After receiving the product and trying it on my own hair, I have to give it just an average rating.  Here is what the Remington does right:    1.  The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is a huge plus.  No cords get in the way, which has always been an issue with traditional clippers.  2.  The bi-directional cutting is wonderful, and combined with the ambidextrous design this makes the clipper equally useful in either hand and in both directions.  3.  The pop-up trimmer is the perfect size to trim around the ears.  It is longer and narrower than typical back-of-the-electric razor trimmers, which makes the hard-to-reach places and angles much easier to navigate.    Here are the issues I have with the Remington:    1.  Unless you want a true short-all-over cut, this clipper isn&#x27;t for you.  My hair is longer on the top, but very short on the sides and in the back.  I like to start short on the bottom and then blend it with longer hair as I move up.  That strategy doesn&#x27;t work well with this trimmer.  My personal attempt resulted in choppy cuts that had to be smoothed over with regular clippers.  2.  The contour shape of the plastic length attachment and the blades are only good for the round parts of your head.  The sides of my head don&#x27;t happen to bulgeout in a rounded fashion, so it made trimming the sides of my hair very difficult.  Navigating around the ears was also trouble.  3.  The plastic attachment quickly fills up with cut hair and needs to be emptied.  I would prefer that it just fell off and didn&#x27;t accumulate in the clipper.    Maybe I am not the intended user for this product.  If I just wore buzz cuts or crew cuts, this product would get 5 stars from me.  With that type of haircut, you really will get a quick and clean cut.  But I think others like me would appreciate a little more flexibility in dealing with blending slightly longer hair.</li>
    <li> The devil is in the details, or so the saying goes. With the RSCC, Satan&#x27;s been forced out of the hair-cutting business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I&#x27;ve become a proponent of self-cut short hair. It&#x27;s easier to manage and I don&#x27;t have to deal with barbers who no longer want to be called barbers but aesthetes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The normal clippers I use while perfectly adequate always seem to leave a section of hair longer or shorter than others. This is very frustrating. The Short Cut Clipper cuts hair perfectly to the same desired length with every pass. The design of it means I can hold it like a comb and move it through the hair as with a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved cutting clippers that can be raised and lowered with a clicker setting combined with a guard ensures the DIY barber will not be able to give himself (or herself?) a bad haircut. Highly recommended and a joy to own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update (6/22/2009): Using the Remington Short Cut continues to be a pleasure however, I have finally found one shortcoming: the build-up of hair in the  teeth and comb of the implement really impedes continued hair-cutting past a few (2 or 3) minutes. This would have brought down the star rating from 5 to 4 or 4.5.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer at a Linens N Things going out of business sale for less than $20.  I used it to give my husband a much needed haircut (I usually cut his hair but have been too busy..)with terrific results!  Once I was comfortable with the unit I gave him a great (short) haircut in minutes. The best part is he can now cut his hair weekly himself without any fuss and he no longer has to wait for me.  I think I love this new gadget more than he does! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pointers:&lt;br /&gt;*  charge fully before using.&lt;br /&gt;*  read the furnished manual ;-)&lt;br /&gt;*  use only when a very short cut is desired.&lt;br /&gt;*  can be used in the shower (before taking a shower!) by themselves for a weekly - no mess no fuss self-haircut n cleanup!&lt;br /&gt;*  Great gift from spouses to their husbands!  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;* also great for the busy road warrior who doesn&#x27;t have time to find a salon while on the road. It&#x27;s small compact size and tiny charger fits readily into luggage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all very worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2012:  I deducted a star since one day the comb broke the Remington was accidentally dropped into the sink making the device mostly useless.  Since the Remington was only dropped a few inches I expected the comb to be sturdier. While it was still functional the Remington saved us quite a bit of money on hair cuts and allowed my husband to maintain a good appearance while I was out of town for an extended duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the Remington was such I would buy another, but since then we found the [[ASIN:B004QHDJNI Philips Norelco Qc5340/40 Hair Clipper Pro]] which my husband absolutely loves!! The Philips QC5340 allows much better precision on length as well as longer lengths up to a #13 comb! With only two attachments to worry about the Philips is a Winner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the clipper. For me it&#x27;s serving two for the price of one as I&#x27;ve short beard which gets evenly trimmed at setting 4\\&quot;. Perfect for me. Highly recommend it. The only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because i prefer to have a little longer hair on head [5 or 6\\&quot;] would have got my all 5 stars!!!    Still the best so far!!!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these 2 days ago. I keep my hair very short and from the reviews posted I thought this was the answer. I charged the clippers for 36 hours and it ran out of power after 5 minutes of use. My hair was ruined, it looked like I had cut it with a bushhog or a pair of pinking shears. My hair was gapped up something terrible. I finished cutting my hair with my regurlar old clippers. I had to cut it pretty short to clean up the mess the Shortcut made of my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again on my hair if I were being paid to use it. This worthless piece of metal and plastic is going back to Walmart tomorrow. Be advised this is a worthless piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Naturally it all depends on what your objective is, mine was to cut pretty much all the hair on my head off (due to male pattern balding starting the job off for me).  This unit does a bang up job, and was much easier than the clippers I was using (takes only a few minutes to cut the entire head).  Being wireless is also a huge plus.  It also works great on body hair.  Some reviewers complained about it being curved and this causing a problem for cutting non head-shaped places but I have not experienced any problems with is.  I am exceptionally happy with the Shortcut!    Update 10/27/09: After 2 failures I have decided this is garbage.  They simple stop working after a few weeks, one failed, I sent it back and to their credit they did send a replacement, but it also failed after a few weeks.  Used each maybe 3 times.</li>
    <li> Heard that the battery doesn&#x27;t work after several recharges.... will see, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I usually cut my here every other day and the product that I bought works fantastic for that I have not had a problem or issues with shortcut would recommend it to a friend my sons thinking about buying it thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product several times over the years. Each unit replaced the former unit, as the product malfunctions with in a year. It cuts hair effectively, but the battery gets worn out way too soon. Eventually, a full day&#x27;s charge gives you 10 minutes if your lucky. The most recent one I bought broke within a month or so.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product. It seems to cut just alright and not that even. After I thought I was done there spots where it didn&#x27;t cut making it uneven.You always have to stop to clean the hair out as it get clogged up.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> awesome tool for self cutter and trying to save some money.</li>
    <li> Oddly enough, this review is coming from a female-I have muscular dystrophy and can&#x27;t get my hands up high enough to do my hair, so I wear wigs! My husband &amp;#34;buzzes &amp;#34; what little hair I have about once a week. This product is FANTASTIC for this purpose!!! It is quick for him to use, and causes no pain for me, unlike the bulky old barber shears or the horrible razors and shaving cream! Just a review someone out there might use!</li>
    <li> Self sharpening...  you can&#x27;t get any better than that...too bad my husband won&#x27;t let me use it on the dogs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;changed my review,  battery dies out quickly a piece of trash within 9 months.  FORGET ABOUT IT</li>
    <li> I purchased this in March 2011.    The battery died on August 2011.    I doubt I will purchase from Remington ever again.</li>
    <li> The Remington Short Cut Clipper works great for me, I used it for the first time today. I keep my hair super short, This clipper system is easy and fast. I use to use the clippers that I had to plug into an electrical outlet, These bad boys are rechargeable and works perfect for a nice even cut. You cant go wrong with this clipper, I really love it.</li>
    <li> Shortcut Clipper by Remington&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this primarily to cut my sideburns.  I often found myself going to the barbershop mainly to get my sideburns trimmed back.  I keep my hair fairly short, a number 3 on the sides, number 4 on top.  I would imagine it would work well on facial hair, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and charged it overnight.  Was very careful to set the length on the controls and took care of my sideburns in about 5 seconds.  I may try doing my whole head.  For now, I&#x27;m happy with it.  This thing pays for itself after skipping only two haircuts in my neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for people with short hair, either facial or on their head that don&#x27;t want to be bother with going to the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  August 2008</li>
    <li> My husband has male pattern baldness--just some fuzz now on top and a nice fringe of fine hair from ear to ear. He&#x27;s been clippering his own hair for quite a while now. Says that someone who can comb his hair with a washcloth doesn&#x27;t need to spend money on haircuts. He does buzz it all over from time to time, but lately has just been neatening the edges, and chopping all the dome fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to know: This thing takes a long time to charge. Like a day. The curved shape is nice to hold--fits in your hand comfortably, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily match the shape on one&#x27;s head. The balding comb is pretty fragile. I thought it was a goner trying to get it off. The important thing to know and what you gain by reading instructions is that the balding comb is installed and if you use it from the get-go, you get a buzz. Even on the other lengths, this is intended to give a nice short haircut. So if you&#x27;re just looking to trim longer hair, you should probably look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think once he gets the hang of it, this will be a nice trimmer for him. It did a nice job on the edges.</li>
    <li> This is a very good clipper for tight haircuts and a great price for what you get.  The first time I used it, I ended up with great results.  The balding comb will do just that on the lowest setting.  Only drawback was the maximum length you can get is 1/2 inch, so you have to like it short.  All in all, much easier than any other clipper out there (especially if you cut your own hair).</li>
    <li> This fun little package makes short clean cuts(or bald) a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;I mastered the different settings and came out looking modern fresh and neat.It supplies direction for the best and simple resuts.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it as often as I can to keep my head looking fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I love it&#x27;s shape and easy to clean style.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper for those with short hair.  If you like the buzz look, it works great.  The design of the clipper is great, because it is just like combing your hair.  Good for little kids with buzz cuts as well, it is a little less intimidating, since it looks like a comb that cuts hair.  It has multiple lengths, but all are really short in my view.  Product is well made and designed.  Highly recommend for anyone who has buzz cut hair.</li>
    <li> After using a standard clipper for years I found it saves time (about 4X faster then the standard clipper) and it does a better job.</li>
    <li> &gt;&gt; Nov. 29 Update: &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the review below after using the clipper once. Sadly, the second time around was not as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper stopped clipping after a few minutes of use. I cleaned it thoroughly and I restarted and it worked for a few more minutes. Another cleaning followed and... so on. It was a time consuming process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, as I was taking a shower, I heard a strange buzzing sound. It turns out it was the clipper that decided to turn itself on, inside a drawer. The on/off switch could not stop it but some vigorous shaking did. A few minutes later, as I was discussing the incident with my wife, I heard the buzzing again. More shaking pacified the clipper again, I don&#x27;t know for how long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that, the more one uses this device, the harder it is to use. I would not have bought it, had I known that what I just shared with you was going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; End of Nov. 29 update &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;_____________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must start with a confession: I used to be a Flowbee man well... until last night. I hate hair-cutting/sculpting/design establishments for several reasons but I won&#x27;t go into that now. The short of it is that I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for the past 15 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this clipper because Amazon had it on sale and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Somewhat to my surprise, I like it and I will use it to cut my hair. I will also use it to cut my boys&#x27; hair because they hate the &#x27;professional&#x27; jobs too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is sold as a &#x27;short cut&#x27; device but, as someone famous used to say, it all depends on what the meaning of &#x27;short&#x27; is. The manual suggests that the &#x27;longest&#x27; setting is at 1/2 inch but, in practice, you can easily do 1-inch and even longer haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The operation is easy: after you charge the device, you turn it on and you begin &#x27;combing&#x27; your hair with it. My wife started it but, after a few minutes, I became confident enough to do it myself with her watching and cheerleading me. I works fast but you may have to take it apart and clean it if your hair is too long to begin with. I had to do that. The end-result is something that could easily pass for a $20 salon job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technical details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The blade&#x27;s shape approximates the curvature of the skull, making for a more even cut.&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeable - needs no batteries for its lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;- The blade guard can be removed for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be cleaned with water or a brush.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with 2 combs, one of them allowing for a &#x27;near-bold&#x27; length while protecting the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big issue with this device is that you get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the clipper itself&lt;br /&gt;- the regular comb&lt;br /&gt;- the bold-cut comb&lt;br /&gt;- the brush&lt;br /&gt;- the 1/8 ounce oil bottle&lt;br /&gt;- the charge adapter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds up to SIX discrete, small or very small (the brush, the oil bottle) and easy to misplace items and there is no storage box or bag included. I would have gladly paid a few more dollars if such a necessary convenience was added. Since this is not the case, I am taking away 1 star from what should have been an easy 5-star evaluation.to do it myself with her watching and cheerleading me.

    <li> I was actually surprised at how well this works. The trimmer at the end is bogus, but I don&#x27;t really need that.</li>
    <li> saving me thousands of dollars from going to the barber shop. It works, it&#x27;s easy to do.  I just doesn&#x27;t get any better then that.</li>
    <li> I have been using clippers to do my own hair for a long time now. I figured for the amount of hair I had left I wasn&#x27;t going to pay a barber shop! So, I was very excited to see a product that looked so easy to use. However, it gives a very ragged cut from what I have been able to do so far. I think it has something to do with the two attachments. If you want very short it may work better. I&#x27;ve gone back to my old clippers. They take a little longer to give myself a haircut, but the results are far more even.</li>
    <li> It has a slight learning curve but works as advertised cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer is ineffective.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well, but battery now failing to hold a charge. Guard comb also cracked soon after purchase, but kept functioning</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one. It is true, the battery lasts 2-3 years before it can no longer hold a charge and you cannot replace them.  However, the blades remain sharp and it does the job very quickly.  I take out the plastic attachment and just use it for a close cut.  I tried many others but this one is the most efficient and quickest due to the 1)large head and 2)contoured shape.  And for the price, its worth buying every few years.</li>
    <li> I have purchased four of these units over the past three years. I kept hoping each new one would be free of defect but not the case. Each failed after a SHORT period to hold a charge or failed to start. Very disappointing. If the quality were upgraded, I would be willing to pay more because its design and usefulness would be better than anything on the market. The operational lights don&#x27;t work and its really not worth the effort and cost to send it back. Make a serious product and this would be a BIG seller. Are you listening Remington??</li>
    <li> There is a recurring theme in these reviews. Users complain that this clipper loses its battery capacity. They conclude this because the clipper bogs down during a clip session - the motor slows down and eventually stops.  I was having the same problem and figured the clipper was a lemon. But I went back and started re-reading the reviews here to see what others had experienced.  I found one review where the reviewer claimed he had brought his clipper back to life by lubricating it with clipper oil. I had some clipper oil in the house and figured it was worth a shot.  And presto! A few drops of clipper oil on the blades and the clipper came back to life. In fact it was actually working better than when it was new. It maintained full speed throughout the cut, which it had not done since a month after I bought it.  I now put a couple of drops of clipper oil on the blades before each use. The clipper works beautifully. I clip down to stubble once a week. The clipper does a very fast and complete job. The curved shape really speeds the process up compared with flat clippers.   I am now a very satisfied customer.  I use [[ASIN:B000B9SFQG Wahl 4-Ounce Blade Oil]] but I&#x27;m sure any clipper oil would work.</li>
    <li> This is a 1-star product for one reason, and one reason alone: the battery recharge is defective. After just a few uses, the unit stops charging and can only hold a charge for 5 to 10 seconds (if that). At the time of writing this review, this product doesn&#x27;t hold a charge at all and won&#x27;t even turn on anymore. I&#x27;ve only had it for a year or so and only used it about 5 or 6 times.  During the first few uses, the unit worked great, and I would have highly recommended it! The battery takes forever to recharge (a full day!), but as long as I remembered to plug it in a day or two before I wanted to do the actual hair cut, it worked flawlessly. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. If the recharge actually worked, I&#x27;d probably give this product a 3.5 or 4-star review (losing a point or so for the long recharge and inability to use while plugged in).  From what I&#x27;ve read in other places, this particular model has been discontinued. If Remington ever releases an updated version that actually works, I may give it a try. In the meantime, I recommend that you find an alternative clipper set, perhaps the [[ASIN:B002C741MW Philips Norelco QC5170 180-Degree Hair Clipper]].</li>
    <li> Works GREAT. Have not had the battery troubles others have discussed in other reviews I saw.  Easy to use and clean and makes for VERY easy DIY clipping - saves me having to nag my wife and saves a ton on haircuts. My son and I both use it and love it.</li>
    <li> Its weak but does work for close to the scalp. Would not buy again. Would not recommend except for some one who wants the bald scalp.</li>
    <li> If there is a bigger waste of money on this earth, I can&#x27;t imagine what it is! I bought this to buzz cut my hair. It works fine if you only have three hairs on your head and you can go over them four times. Oh wait, you&#x27;ll need to recharge this crap for 16 hours after two passes after you take it apart to clear the clogs. I couldn&#x27;t get this crap through my hair so I pitched it in the trash. Lesson learned. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these. The last one lasted about two years before the battery wouldn&#x27;t take a charge any more. That is my only complaint, other than I also wish they would make this a little more durable. The trimmer does work well. I use my Wahl first to get the majority of my hair cut, then I use the Remington to fine tune, by blending the side of my head, which I cut shorter than my top.</li>
    <li> *PRO  This hair clipper is really easy to use, and it definitely saved time to trim my hair.  *CON  It doesn&#x27;t cut my hair evenly. Not much. But it was big problem for me.  Battery takes forever to get charged but it runs less than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money.  It&#x27;s curved so if your head isn&#x27;t a perfectly symmetrical sphere you can&#x27;t possible get a uniform cut.  And since the blades point straight down you have to go over a every spot on your head repeatedly (like 12-48 times) to get every hair trimmed.  I kept thinking that maybe I just needed to get used to it, but I found that my haircuts took way too long and I&#x27;d still have to use my Wahl beard trimmer to finish up patches.  There are two adults in my household that tried to use this - both of us hated it.  I finally bought a Philips Norelco Qc5550 - substantially more expensive but soooo much better - we both love it.  You definitely get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This thing worked great for about 4 months. The battery is a built in ni-mh type and quit working. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> This product was great while it worked but like other reviewers noted, my battery stopped working and it would not hold a charge.  The poor design also does not allow you to use it when plugged into an outlet so it&#x27;s all but useless when the battery stops working.  It was great while it worked but not well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of these. Model SCC-100R  Pros: Three stars  Great for guys with thin hair  Easy to use  Remington will honor the warranty when it quits working. (See below)  Cons: One Star  After about 8 to 14 months the battery in all three that I&#x27;ve used suddenly quit charging and the cutter will no longer work.  If Remington improves the battery or makes one with a cord making the device more reliable the cutter will be much better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I keep my hair very short and wanted a cordless trimmer.  I have used this product three times and while I do not have trouble with the power, the clippers ability to uniformly cut all of my hair is horrendous.  Chalk this up to user error is you want, but I dont have any issues when going back to my corded clippers.  Also, due to the curvature of the clippers, I cannot get to certain spots, like behind my ears, or sideburns, which means I have to try to blend those in with my trimmer clippers (doesnt look right).  Lastly, there is no blend adjustment, only 1, 1.5, 2 and so on with two different guards.  This product may work fine for you, but doesnt help me to cut my hair the way I want.</li>
    <li> Great product and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Battery life not very good, does the job, but you ave to go over and over the same spots and will lose it&#x27;s charge in the middle of a cutting.</li>
    <li> I have used the Remington Short Cut Clipper for five years.  My first lasted forty months, until the battery would no longer charge.  Spreading the purchase price of (then) $24.95 over 40 months, it cost just 0.63 cents per haircut .  I keep mine plugged in all the time, when not in use, and this may or may not prolong battery life (I haven&#x27;t identified the type of battery, in order to determine best practice for charging).  Regardless, this clipper is a great way to cut your hair without the risk of making an accidental divot.  It takes me about fifteen to twenty minutes to cut my hair--far less time than it would take to drive to a barber shop, wait my turn, and receive a haircut.  If you value self-sufficiency, this a great tool!  I keep one active and one in reserve. I haven&#x27;t had the negative experiences reported by some owners, but do want to echo reports that the clipper comes with the &amp;#34;balding attachment&amp;#34; installed, rather than the adjustable comb. Make sure to swap the adjustable comb for the &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; attachment unless you want a &amp;#34;buzz cut&amp;#34;.  I recommend this product without reservation.</li>
    <li> Works well for me as an alternate to shaving my scalp</li>
    <li> An excellent clipper; easy to use and only takes about 24 hours to charge, but I only use it once a week.</li>
    <li> Order these for my uncle to replace some old ones he had.  We looked all over and couldn&#x27;t find the, at the stores. Thank you</li>
    <li> I received this item for a Christmas gift in 2010. I had clippers which were in good order so I had no use for the trimmer at the time of the gift. Recently I decided to open the package to check the trimmer out. I opened the package, took out the trimmer and plug, read the instructions, plugged it in and PRESTO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Neither would it charge, the indicator light come on or anything. It is essentially a piece of metal that I never received one second of use from. Remington was no help, trying to direct me to a repair facility, which would have cost more than the item. Instead of righting a wrong, they chose to ignore it. Proceed at your own risk but if a three year old, brand-new in the package unit does not work it all, it doesn&#x27;t speak or bode well for Remington.</li>
    <li> Wives!  Do you want to get out of cutting hair?  This clipper really does the job.  My husband really can cut his own his perfectly with this clipper.  He actually seems to enjoy it  because it massages his head as he is cutting his own hair.  I just trim around the back of his neck and ears for him.  That I don&#x27;t mind doing for him.  Why do I hate cutting hair you may ask?  Because my wonderful husband always asked me to cut his hair at the most inopportune time.  So, this saves on a lot of frustrations between us!  He&#x27;s happy and I am too. He loves it!</li>
    <li> I like the self cutting of this and I think it works very well and a person was able to get a good cut.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE and TERRIBLE!     There are two good things in an otherwise vast sea of failure for this device. One: It is cordless. Two: It fits easily in the garbage can.     I bought this clipper to replace an old Wahl clipper that had outlived its usefulness. I thought that the description was pretty innovative, and waited for it to come out.     However, this thing is absolutely abysmal at the actual job of cutting hair. I keep my hair cut very short, usually a one or a two with other clippers. It should be noted that on this clipper, the #1 setting will scalp you bald.     So I went to the task of starting with a #2 trim, which didn&#x27;t seem to be cutting any hair at all. I went down to a #1.5 which cut my hair very short, but it was acceptable. That is, until in the middle of cutting my hair, the guide slipped down to setting #1, scalping me on the side of my head.     Beyond that, the teeth in the comb constantly fill up with hair, having to be emptied out with a great deal of frequency. It will still cut hair while it&#x27;s full, but it will keep mulching the hair that is trapped in there, creating a fine dust that spreads everywhere as the hair trapped in the guide comb keeps getting re-cut.     In short, stay FAR, FAR AWAY from this, you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a HUGE favor!</li>
    <li> The Remington \\&quot;Short Cut\\&quot;  hair clipper is, just as the name implies, for short haircuts. I had been considering going to a shorter style for a while, and thought this would be a good opportunity to move in that direction. So I gave it a shot and was pleased with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longest finished length this clipper will allow is somewhere between ¼ and ½ inch. The adjustable length comb has ½ inch teeth, but the curved blade comes up into the teeth some way, making the finished length of the hair less than the length of the teeth. The depth of cut is controlled by a thumb wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not try to use this clipper if your hair has any length at all. If your hair is long enough to fall over on its own the clipper will just bend it over and won&#x27;t effectively cut it. It is obviously intended to give an even trim to very short hair styles, with the hair standing up as it passes the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, this clipper will not take you to a short hairstyle, but it will very effectively maintain one. If you have longer hair, your best bet is to go to a stylist for the initial cut and use the trimmer to maintain the look. While it won&#x27;t replace professional haircuts, it will reduce the need for them from 8 to 12 times a year to one or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extendable trimmer works well for cleaning up edges and mowing around ears and other obstructions. You are still going to want somebody to help even-up things in the back for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is relatively quiet, does not heat up like many clippers do, and fully charges in about 14-hours. One charge is plenty to complete a good trimming.  The teeth and blade are removable for cleaning and the instructions say the unit can be immersed in water for cleaning (although I didn&#x27;t try it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will want to do the trimming with a towel or other \\&quot;drop cloth\\&quot; around your shoulders and quite a few fine trimmings will end-up on the floor.  When all is said and done the Remington Short Cut Clipper does the job, and will pay for its self with just a few missed haircuts.y for its self with just a few missed haircuts.</li>
    <li> After three weeks clippers seem to work great. The clippers were advertised as in stock and could be delivered the next day. However, since I took advantage of the free shipping they did not get put in the mail until five days after they were purchased.</li>
    <li> So, If I want a buzz cut for 8 years (how long I have been using the Shortcut) , I will have a buzz cut every week or two. Lets say every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$15 x 56/2 &#x3D; $420 per year for a barber to maintain my haircut. Thats not even including tips&lt;br /&gt;$420 x 8 years &#x3D; $3360&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd Shortcut over 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;$30 x 3years &#x3D; $90&lt;br /&gt;So I pay approx. $90&lt;br /&gt;Thats a savings of around $2850 over 7 years, Plus about 180 hours (7.5 days!!!!) of commuting and waiting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Shortcut was damaged because I accidentally left it outside and it rained. The second Shortcut was damaged because I was rinsing it out with water and the battery went out - although the product claims that you can rinse it off, I wouldnt recommend it. Just brushing it off with a brush or can of air-duster should be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they modified the battery at some point - I feel that the latest one I purchased holds a lot more charge and although it is the same aesthetic design, is somehow holding up longer than the last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third Shortcut is working perfectly after about 4-5 years - no problems. I think Remington did something to improve the battery life. I am noticing that it holds the charge alot better than my first two. Maybe Im lucky. If it ever goes out I will just buy another one - after 2 cuts the device pays for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are happy with a buzz cut and dont want to get too creative with your hair style - this thing is the bomb!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer after using a conventional hair cutter to do my own hair for the past year.  I have to say that the Remington Short Cut Clipper is fantastic for doing your own hair IF you want it very short.  I tried several lengths starting with 3 and found that it was rather uneven until I got down to 1.5 or 2.  I liked the 1.5 best so have been using that setting.  It is quite easy to get an even cut with the curved comb and the ability to cut while moving the trimmer forward and backwards is great.  For the price it is a great buy.    I also have used it to trim my chest and stomach hair.  The curved comb can sometimes make this difficult but overall it works well.    The pop-up straight trimmer is a little too narrow for easy use so I just use my conventional trimmer for sideburns instead of the pop-up.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty amazing invention.  My wife has always had to shave my head, but now I can do it myself. This shaver is comfortable to use and makes quick work of my thick head of hair.  It holds a charge really well, and clean up is a snap.  Highly recommend...</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper]] I like this product for me and my son.  I am cutting mine on the 3 setting which is short but not shaved bald and doing it weekly.  I like the way it cuts and looks.  I am cutting my son&#x27;s setting 4 on top and setting 3 on sides and back of head.  His hair was thick, and it took much longer to do his, but even his mother liked it.  With this device it is much harder to make a mistake than the old clippers.  I would say it is great for an older balding guy.</li>
    <li> I bought this model for my husband 9 years ago in an attempt to get him to cut his own hair...took a little practice, but he is successfully able to cut it (and it even looks decent!) He does keep his hair super short. I bought another one only because after the 9 years of using it every 2-3 weeks the battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the fact that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in and charging.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this for his military haircuts, and I was leary about using it for anything else.  However, our baby has gotten a bald spot on the back of his head, and is only a few months old, and I didn&#x27;t want to take him to a barber yet.  I used these by myself, with the baby on my lap.  Because his hair is very fine, this took about 10 minutes to cut the top to about an inch and the sides to about 1/2 inch.  His hair looks a lot better, and because you don&#x27;t need to worry about the clippers being a certain angle to cut, he was very happy throughout the haircut.  I had to shake the clippers a few times because his fine hair got stuck in the guard, but it was a million times easier than worrying about scissors or a stranger with clippers on a baby with no motor skills.  The haircut looks professional (when my husband got home, he said &#x27;looks like you took him to the barber&#x27;).  Very very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take skill, just make sure that you use the combs with the guard that goes across the bottom in places and not the one that is open at the bottom.  Would recommend to everyone who wants to cut their baby&#x27;s hair, or anyone who wants to do their own short cuts.  Do not know about cutting adult regular cuts, because that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;ve used it for.    Added on 3/15/2011:  Once the batteries have been charged a few times, there is no way to keep a charge.  You can plug it in constantly when not being used, but they will die after only a couple minutes.  Had to eventually throw them away.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> Works best with soft dry hair. Helps to use a hand mirror to view the back.  The user needs to develop some manual dexterity.  If you wear your hair short it&#x27;s worth the price. Like all clippers without an attached vacuum it leaves a mess to clean up.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest and fastest hair cutting product I have ever used.  In 2 minutes you are done!</li>
    <li> This clipper is the answer to an even cut every time!  It travels with me so that I can have that fresh cut any time.</li>
    <li> This clipper is alright as long as you don&#x27;t plan on cutting a lot of hair.  The unit lacks enough power to trim anything more than a couple days of growth on your head.</li>
    <li> After going through the initial hair loss and thinning process, my hair was beginning to look like a birds nest (depending on which way the wind happened to be blowing). So, I decided to keep it short. Incidentally, I have a flowbee that I bought back in 1996 and it still works great!! I bought this little guy for something portable, quick, and not requiring a great deal of effort to setup. I Love It! I take it outside and it takes about ten minutes. It gives me a very neat cut and If you have someone that can trim behind your ears and the back of your neck... you just can&#x27;t get a better haircut. You&#x27;ll certainly save some bucks on barber visits. Two months now and it is holding up fine. It says you can rinse it under running water to clean out the hair, but I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with that so I blew it out with my compressor, and then gave it a light oiling after each use. But if you use it once a week or so, you don&#x27;t get much hair in it and you can just blow it out by mouth... then oil. I&#x27;m sure I will eventually wear it out, but I&#x27;ll gladly buy another.</li>
    <li> If you want to keep a short haircut in great condition this is the machine to do it easily and very conveniently. Impressive from the first time I used it and after 8 months I am still impressed. Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11-09-2012: Now have been using this contraption for over a year and still impressed with it and still have had no battery charge problems that so many have complained about. I think that I might have received a good one out of the bunch rather than the normal crap I am used to getting :o)Still love it and would highly recommend one to buyers except for those that have very thin hair. Not thin as in balding hair but literally thin (diameter) hair. We tried using this thing on a friend that has very thin hair and it did not cut it very well. Normal hair and this thing works very well and I am surprised it is not on every shelf in the big box stores.</li>
    <li> First cut was okay second cut was just okay third use put a big bald spot right by my ear. I&#x27;m still getting used to it maybe I&#x27;ll get better but the back and forth side to side is how it happened so I&#x27;ll be careful when I make those moves from now on.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I discovered that the small oil bottle make all the difference in keeping the Remington SCC-100 Clipper going when it starts slowing down.  It only takes a couple drops, and it will keep going for several weeks more.  Just keep doing this, and your clipper should last for many years.  Funny this though--Remington did not tell me this when I telephoned them to complain about their product.  You don&#x27;t have to keep buy new one after new one.  JUST USE THE OIL THAT WAS PROVIDED WITH YOUR CLIPPER.  I have to say I think it is a good product for a short haircut.  However, the battery will not hold a charge for any length of time for it to be useful.  Worst of all, this particular clipper is designed so it will NOT operate while plugged into an electrical outlet.  This clipper is a perfect example of how today’s manufacturers take advantage of the buying public.  Instead of producing a product that will last at least a few years, they make the product so it will FAIL to operate within a few months.  Great job, Remington--you excel in cheating your customers!  As for myself, I will never buy this product again, and I encourage other people to do the same!</li>
    <li> works great but after a year or little past batteries die.i have had to replace 3 times already. they do replace for free because of warranty but after a year you will need new one.</li>
    <li> Same problem as others.  Definite flaw with the battery.  It was fine for about a year of VERY little use, but now won&#x27;t hold-or take a charge.  I keep it plugged in &amp; it just shuts off after 10 seconds &amp; I can tell right away that it&#x27;s NEVER fully changed.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great, but as others have mentioned, the batteries fade after a 2 - 3 years.  Therefore, this is the 3rd I have purchased in recent years.  Unfortunately, they will not run with the adapter plugged into it, which would solve the issue for me.  Still, they make sense in the long run, even with this singular shortcoming.</li>
    <li> Now I can maintain short hair style easier than before. Simple and fast because you can do it yourself. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have saved tons of money by cutting my own hair.  The clipper has 8 settings that help even the most inexperienced user cut their own hair flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again.  In fact I always have two extras on the shelf as a replacement.</li>
    <li> never pay for another haircut again. Best invention ever</li>
    <li> It is the best cut Clipper ever seen... I have used this product sinc 2012 and I am very satisfied,</li>
    <li> I keep my hair cut short with this product it works without any effort I also use it to keep my full beard short like I like it. Overall this is a great multi use product.</li>
    <li> Finally something that I can use to keep my hair trimmed uniformly so I dont drown in sweat in this climate</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this clipper and has tried other brands and styles and always comes back to this one!!!</li>
    <li> Simply put, it&#x27;s cheap. The guards are flexible and don&#x27;t lock into place. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years, I&#x27;ve never had a problem. I saw this product and bought into all it promised in the item description. I tried it, it was terrible. I ended up with un-even chunks taken out of my hair. I ended up using my old set of clippers and taking it all the way down to my scalp. This was a couple of weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve since calmed down, but my experience with this product was so bad that I will never purchase a Remington product of any kind again. Good luck.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. The first one lasted 4 years and only quit because the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. This one seems to have a different battery, I hope it will last as well or better than the last one.</li>
    <li> Very good device for personal grooming...works as advertised.</li>
    <li> New idea but does not work as expected. Very hard to cut hair around ears. Also, the battery only lasts about 15 minutes, i think spec says over 40 minutes. When battery is dead, you can not turn this ON when it is being charged, poor design.</li>
    <li> Works great, this is my second one. The first one lasted a couple of years before the crappy battery crapped out. The Bald ON Top Mans best friend.</li>
    <li> takes a while to get used to but after many uses I think I have it mastered. I use flowbee and this together, flowbee for the longer hair and this remington clipper to tighten everything up that I keep short. this actually kicks butt as a body trimmer too, wide cutting surface allows you to trim body hair fast. you have to plug it in about a day before you&#x27;re going to use it to insure the battery lasts your whole hair cutting/trimming session guess that&#x27;s the only downfall but it does a good job and pays for itself fast.</li>
    <li> I completely remove the guard and trim my entire head once a week with this in the shower and it does a great, quick job. I started with using this for my head, which is very quick and easy thanks to the curve, and smaller trimmer for my beard, but after a couple tries, doing my beard with the huge cutting surface of this was much quicker. I use mine in the shower so eventually they fail, but on average, one unit will last about a year if I take it out of the shower after use and use oil whenever I hear it whine under load.</li>
    <li> Put long cut comb on, use it as a hairbrush, 10 min later all done. Haven&#x27;t got a haircut in four months.</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for my last set i lost. Love this product</li>
    <li> This fine clipper was the very first in my journey into self-barbering.  Some may complain that it is cheap and not of the highest quality, and they do so rightfully.  But let me say this - the Remington Short Cut is the perfect tool to help you build your confidence before moving on to more beefy clippers such as the Andis Masters.  If you can comb your hair, you can use this tool.  Once you feel confident, step it up to the next level.</li>
    <li> Awesome product but you need like 5 of them on standby. I don&#x27;t use it quite as much but when I do decide to keep hair short I use it like every 2 weeks and on my third one. Last around 3 years for me but only because I go long stretches with long hair. I could easily see the battery lasting a year or less with regular use. Also as time goes by the charge up lasts less and less so be careful when cutting hair before something important and you&#x27;re running late because once it stops, it stops for good. Charges last less and less and less until it&#x27;s dead forever. I wish they&#x27;d just get rid of the charging option all together if they aren&#x27;t capable of making  good model and use a standard battery we can replace.</li>
    <li> This works well for really really short cuts, and less so for slightly longer settings (Size 2 and longer).  Very easy to use though, and small enough and light enough to take when traveling.  Very easy to use too.  And it seems to hold the charge well...I&#x27;m almost tempted to leave the charger home on trips as it will likely not be needed.  I&#x27;ve used it a lot now and never got cut by it.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Would last longer if it was truly water proof. I&#x27;ve bought about 7 units in the last 3 years. Some never charged. Others never kept a charge. Most fail after water gets into unit. Rinse carefully &amp; fast. Never submerge in water; it will fail if water gets into unit.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this, after reading some of the reviews posted here, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on it. This little trimmer is worth its weight in gold! First of all, the battery charge is more than adequate for my needs. I use it every two or three days (I use the shortest cut setting) and, although I&#x27;ve never been left stuck half-way through, I make a point to charge it every four or five trims. Being curved, sometimes is a bit tricky to find the &amp;#34;perfect angle.&amp;#34; Regardless, this clipper has already paid for itself and I would gladly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, dependable clipper (if you&#x27;re an extra-hairy gorilla, keep looking) :)</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before but what I discovered with this clipper made me want to let all of you know who have had problems with what seemed like the battery. I have used this for about 16 months and then the same thing happened to me. It seemed like the battery stopped holding a charge and it just stopped working. I was so disappointed because I love this product and I use it a lot and I really couldn&#x27;t believe this was the problem even after everyone had said they had the same issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read through many reviews on Remington&#x27;s website and they never acknowledged that their product had a battery problem despite all the negative reviews (they would respond to each negative review telling the customer to contact customer service). Then I found this post on the website (the picture I posted). Remington said it is recommended to oil the blades for optimum performance. I added some olive oil (any household oil will work) to the blades and it worked like the first time I charged it!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! All it needed was some oil and the blades started moving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product four stars because when it works it works very well but you just have to keep up the maintenance on it. I hope this helps most of you solve your problem and you won&#x27;t have to keep buying new ones every few months. A couple people also mentioned something about cleaning out the blades because they might be clogged, so if the oil doesn&#x27;t work then maybe that might be a solution for you as well.</li>
    <li> This is a very good tool for self haircuts, but I need more experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the first is not smooth, my wife wanted to help me fix the hair, and I said: No!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my new hair style！&lt;br /&gt;L love this tool。thank you!</li>
    <li> I was skeptic of this item before I bought it.  Now I LOVE IT!  I was using a smaller hair/beard trimmer to shave my head, military style, before I bought this. When I first used this I went all over my head to ensure that I cut everything off. Afterwards I didnt believe the amount of time that I had saved by using it compared to my old remington. So I took out my old shaver and put it to my scalp and nothing came off! Did the job of a small hand held shaver in half the time!!! I highly recommend this to anyone that likes a good and easy on the scalp hair cut. Its also adjustable by using a wheel from 1\\&quot;-4\\&quot;. Simply plugs in to the wall with a small 2 prong charger. Includes another attachment, I think for longer hair or something, and some oil. Simply awesome product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0015MS6JO Remington Shortcut Clipper Set]]    A Godsend! In addition to speed, it does a great job on sideburns, and especially those fine hairs on top, which used to lie down flat and avoid blades on regular clippers. Thanks Wall Street Journal!</li>
    <li> The cutter gives a nice even trim. The problem is that not all head surfaces are curved, so it sometimes takes a little work to find a good cutting angle.  The comb comes from the factory with sharp teeth that ride directly against the scalp, so I would recommend trying another product if your scalp is sensitive, like mine. The sensation is like being scratched by a wire brush. The on/off switch is easily activated by pressure, so this may not be good for travel as it would be predictably easy to be turned on in your suitcase.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Remington Short Cut Clipper for my husband but was not very confident that it would do what it said.  My husband read all the directions and use this product and was pleasantly amazed at how good it worked.  It was very easy to use, easy to hold, and he looks as good as when he went to the barber for a haircut.  We would both recommend this product and are sending one to each of our sons.</li>
    <li> After a little work I got the product to cut my hair even and am very satisfied. The only issues is with the trimer - really hard to trim around ears. probably need someone else to help with that from time to time....</li>
    <li> Pro: Great product, Very easy to use! Do a great job with my 1/4\\&quot; cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The rechargeable battery run too short! Need better battery. Or operated with cord. Right now, when you charging it, you can&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated 4 stars, If they improve the battery will have 4.5 and i will recommended to my friends for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I have use this trimmer for 3 years. use it 2x a month to keep my 1/4\\&quot; look. The trimmer is great like I say above. I love using it! however, the battery is the biggest issue! every 1.5 years the battery dies out. The second one I am using right now just die on me again! again is about 1.5 year life. Also the battery is not replaceable and cant use with the cord plugs in, so the trimmer is done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am done with this trimmer, now I have to search something with a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take the 4 stars off, and re-rated 3 stars with the short life usage! $30 for 1.5 year is not bad. But just sucks that i can&#x27;t replace the battery. they should really consider upgrade the battery.</li>
    <li> I am a gadget guy, I like to try new inovative products.  When I saw this in Popular Science mag, I just had to try it.  I have kept my hair short for a few years now, and was always looking for a better way to cut it, besides just a regular pair of electric clippers.  The product does cut already short hair quite well.  It you have longer hair, and are looking to go with a short cut, then you will have to get buzzed with a regular electric clipper first, then maintain with the Short Cut clipper.  To see how good it cut, I let my hair grow out to about 3/4\\&quot; to 1\\&quot; in length.  The clipper has a dial that adjusts the comb that controls the length.  It goes from 1, 1 1/2, 2, 3, 4 (specific length for these dial settings are in the manual).  I started out with 4, and it was just bairly touching my hair, so I switched it down to a 3, and it just started trimming my hair, so I then dialed it down to a 2, and it was the right length for me.  It took several passes to get all of the hair cut, and it does create a very fine cut, so make sure you use it in an area that is easy to clean.  I use mine in the shower, then take a shower right after to keep the mess under control.  Overall, I would say this clipper is quite good, but it would be best to use it about once a week to help maintain your length.</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for an easier way to shave my own head.  I go close to bald (#1 setting or less) and using regular old clippers takes about 20 minutes and a lot of going over the same spots.  I was hoping this would be \\&quot;as easy to use as a brush\\&quot; (as the ad says).  It WAS easy to use.  Unfortunately, it had a couple big flaws.    Flaw #1: Side of the Head Shaving.  The curved blade that is so nice for the back and top of the head is useless on the side of your head just above the ears.  This is the most important area for me to shave down because hair over my ears drives me crazy.  Think about how a curved blade is supposed to get that area.  It can&#x27;t go vertical because your ear is in the way.  It can&#x27;t go horizontal because my head isn&#x27;t rounded there.  Maybe my head is the wrong shape, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.    Flaw #2: \\&quot;Tracks\\&quot;.  If you&#x27;ve used a clipper before, you&#x27;ve probably seen the comb tracks left behind when using an attachment.  Usually, I go over the tracks in different directions to even everything out.  I could not get rid of the tracks using this Clipper.  I looked like my head was striped!  Maybe if I shaved to the lowest setting the tracks would go away?    So, after having two flaws that made these clippers basically useless to me, why three-stars?  Because they work if you are looking for a longer cut.  I used this at the \\&quot;2\\&quot; setting on my son and it cleaned him up nicely.  The design and ease of use are really nice - I just wish it worked better on me.    BOTTOM LINE: If you&#x27;re looking to clean up some straggling hairs on a longer crew/buzz cut - this could be the tool for you.  Using it like a brush is a real time saver.  If you&#x27;re looking to go real short, I would have to recommend you stick with a traditional clipper (such as [[ASIN:B000MND29Q Conair HCT475 Rechargeable Cord/Cordless Pro Style  Kit, 24 Piece]] ).  I always end up using them to clean up after failed attempts with other clippers/razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past three months, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  It produces the same quality haircut as the barber shop, and it&#x27;s as quick and convenient as shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I did not have high expectations when I ordered this product from Amazon.  After it arrived, it took me another month to work up the courage to use it.  Finally, on the first day of my vacation, when I knew I would have time to grow out my hair a bit if the clipper made a mess of things, I took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that the clipper is incredibly easy to use.  Because of the curved design and bidirectional cutters, the optimal motion is very similar to shaving.  You just \\&quot;comb\\&quot; the clipper back and forth around your head until you&#x27;ve covered all areas.  It&#x27;s amazingly simple and produces very even results.  You can literally use it with your eyes closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the problem noted by another reviewer of clogged blades.  I keep my hair trimmed short (about 1/4 inch, or the No. 2 comb on a traditional hair clipper), and the short hairs just fall away.  I suspect that this trimmer is really only suitable for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two issues you should note, though:&lt;br /&gt;1) The trimmer comes from the factory with the balding comb attached.  You need to pop it off and replace it with the comb that let&#x27;s you set hair length.  This is a silly way to ship the clipper -- unless you read the instructions carefully, you might miss this important detail and end up with an essentially shaved head.  Remington should ship it with the safer comb and let you switch to the balding comb.&lt;br /&gt;2) The trimmer doesn&#x27;t have a battery gauge like many shavers, and it cannot run directly off AC power (it won&#x27;t turn on when plugged into the charger).  This can be inconvenient if the trimmer runs out of power half way through a haircut.  I&#x27;ve made it a habit to charge the trimmer once a month whether it needs it or not.  A batter gauge would be nice. [Update 19 March 2011: The clipper is now about 2 1/2 years old, and the batteries don&#x27;t seem to hold a charge as well any more. The clipper still works fine, but now I need to charge it after every use, or the battery dies half way through the next haircut. I wish the batteries were replaceable. I bought another one last month in case the batteries on the original fail completely.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  This clipper has exceeded my expectations.  It allows me to cut my own (admittedly short) hair at home as easily as shaving, rather than having to make trips to the barber shop.  It has already paid for itself, let&#x27;s me cut my hair more frequently (and therefore avoid the \\&quot;hey, you got your hair cut\\&quot; syndrome when I&#x27;d let it get too long before cutting), and is super convenient.

    <li> this is a great product for keeping your hair trimmed short and if you remove the guards it it great for very close trimming. just wish the battery life was longer</li>
    <li> Ingenious design and would really work good if it had more power.  In my experience the motor speed (and cutters) slow down under even a minimal load.  Also, the battery life in my clipper was VERY short.   It&#x27;s possible that the battery is bad, which might also explain the lack of power. I&#x27;m going to send it to Remington to be checked out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happily cutting my own hair (for the most part). My wife helps me get the line straight at the bottom in the back.</li>
    <li> The clipper works great most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not always clear if it&#x27;s being charged,  is fully charged, or what in the world is going on with the charging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems confused as well.  Sometime it will start up with a great deal of cutting enthusiasm and sometime it barely works and will not cut even though I have had it on the charging station for 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there I am sitting in a chair with barber&#x27;s cape etc. and my wife is unable to proceed at that time.  Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had one previously and it had the same problem.  The charging light stopped working after 1 month.  This clipper lasted 1 year then stopped working altogether.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a year and a half and it stopped holding a charge long enough to finish a haircut and it is not user replaceable.  For the price, you could replace it once a year and beat going to a barber, but I just switched to a regular corded trimmer when it stopped holding a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;After hitting the barber every 2 weeks to get my hair shaved down to 1 guard, I bought a pair of regular clippers and had my wife cut my hair for about 6 months.  This paid for itself after a couple of haircuts, but coordinating time for her to do it proved to be harder than just going to the barber.  I ordered this Remington Clipper and am able to do it myself pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thinning and I use this on the shortest setting.  If my hairstyle was any more complicated, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be brave enough to try it with this device, but if you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re probably in the same boat.  For this application, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, it didn&#x27;t look that good and my wife had to help me touch it up.  By the third time, I was able to do it on my own without any help.  It takes a little practice of following the contour of your head in a few areas like above the ears, but once you get it down, it is easy.  I&#x27;d recommend keeping a hand mirror to check the back of your head, though, as it is easy to miss spots if you can&#x27;t see back there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it feels a little flimsy.  It does not feel as solid as the traditional clippers I bought at around the same price as it is entirely plastic other than the cutting blade.  There&#x27;s something in it that rattles if I shake it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it breaks, I&#x27;d buy a new one right away, which is always a strong recommendation for a product.  (I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll still be making them by that point.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problem with the charging.  I usually throw it on the charger after I use it and it still has enough charge to cutmy hair the next time I use it.  (I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of months, so the battery life will probably diminish over time.)&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;After about 18 months of using this, the (non-replaceable) battery stopped holding a charge long enough for a full haircut and I retired it and went back to a regular corded trimmer.  Nice product, but not for the long haul.</li>
    <li> Good, not great, cut is not as even as at your barber. For the price it is great deal. Hopefully will last a long time.</li>
    <li> if you want to look like gibbs on ncis.....this will do it</li>
    <li> We bought this for my son who is in ROTC and clips his hair very short. (Thus use of the product has always been to maintain this short cut, not to achieve it from a full head of hair.)  We gave him the clippers for Christmas 2008.  The battery charge was fair from the beginning and got worse (wouldn&#x27;t stand up to a full clip).  By May 2009 the clippers had stopped working entirely.      Theoretically the product has a 4-year warranty so we&#x27;ll see whether Remington stands behind their product.  As a side note, Amazon Help doesn&#x27;t make it easy to figure out how to make a claim against this warranty (e.g., do we go through Amazon or go directly to the manufacturer?)</li>
    <li> I had my hair cut really short by my barber about 3 weeks ago, and bought this product to maintain the length and shape of my hair.  It was SOOOOO easy to use this product and shave my hair down to the nub.  The my long-haired 6-year-old wanted me to do his head - it came out terrific!!  The battery lasted for both hair cuts - about 15-20 minutes on the first charge.  This clipper will make maintaining the length of my hair a real snap.  This product is very ergonomic and easy to hold and the curved blade area contours it the head perfectly.  The pop-out trimmer works great around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price I paid for these clippers ($31) has already paid for itself when you consider (2) haircuts would have cost me $34 plus tip.  I don&#x27;t think my barber, Ray B., is going to be very happy about this.  Lol....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this to other people, and once you try these clippers you will also recommend it to others.  If I could, I would give these clippers 6 stars!!  :-)</li>
    <li> This thing works great, but you have to keep it cleaned or it will appear to have a dead battery.  Use the brush and/or squirt water inside it.  If there&#x27;s hair inside (that you might not even be able to see), it&#x27;ll stop working, and then you&#x27;ll blame the battery.</li>
    <li> still using it after a few years. great product although the battery no longer holds charge like it used to.  I have to recharge it prior to each use and you cant use it for too long after each charge.</li>
    <li> This works great.  The hair get caught in the guides.  Runs for a long time.  But once its ready to die, theres no notice, just shuts off.</li>
    <li> I used this to keep my head shaved short, and for the most par tit worked well. The only problem is after a bout 6 months of use, the battery just doesn&#x27;t charge. Add to this that It can&#x27;t power directly off outlet power and you have a non functional unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it didn&#x27;t have that problem (I have been through 3 of these) I would give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be tempted to give it 2 or 1 based on the battery issue, however I understand that although I have had three units go that way, there may be another factor at play here, or I may have bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the three I am giving it is based on ho well it works when it works, in spite of longevity issues.</li>
    <li> Charges and cuts well.</li>
    <li> Even after a full charge the clipper simply would *not cut my hair* as I expected and my hair is not thick and it&#x27;s pretty fine.  It just seemed like the hair refused to be guided into the clippers!  Sadly, when I finally got around to using this thing for the first time [today] it was several months after my purchase and now it&#x27;s beyond the return period.  I ended up going to a barber shop with my tail between my legs.&lt;br /&gt;So, money wasted on a product that did not live up to its claims.  Gah.</li>
    <li> good thinking but because the the way the blades are oriented it takes several runs to trim the hair to the desired lenght. Impossible to do the neck and behind the ears. small trimmer on top is way to sharp, it hurts. in short, better off with a regular hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> I love it is good but you have to use it 3 times to understand or get help for me is very easy to use, remember there is no style to cut is just one size only. if you like it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Great for short, frizzy hair that needs to have sticking up ends cut off.</li>
    <li> After a few months of only using it once a month, the battery could not hold a charge. It&#x27;s sad because I liked it, but had to throw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I  will buy again  when needed</li>
    <li> worked ok but wouldn&#x27;t hold charge.</li>
    <li> This is by far the easiest trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  If you can use a comb, you can give yourself a very nice cut.  Takes me about 5 minutes to give myself a high and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little experimentation to figure out how to set the guides, but it really is pretty straight forward. The only thing I would recommend is that you also have something like a beard trimmer to get behind you ears and around the nape of the neck.  According to the manual it takes 8 hours to charge and only cuts for 15 minutes, but in my experience it only takes about 3 to charge and lasts around a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any of the battery problems that others have reported, and even if I did I would  order another one as it paid for itself within the first two uses.</li>
    <li> had same one before, works great</li>
    <li> Easily the best clipper I&#x27;ve owned.  Easiest to use and softest on the head. The curved portion really helps in making it easy to use every 3 days</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any jams or problems at all with the unit. The first time, I got a so-so cut with it. Getting used to it, I &amp;#34;understand&amp;#34; I need to go back and forth more times than I did with the one I replaced, but once I did that it gets a pretty even cut. Remember to knock out hair from the combs to keep it working well as you cut. A couple cuts later and I figure I&#x27;m way ahead $$$ already. Much faster to use this than a flowbee (I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for decades) and can touch up my buzzcut in the shower stall (dry/no water) in minutes with no big mess to put away. I touch up at least once a week and it works for me. Couldn&#x27;t really ask for more for the device it is. Still would have room to buy &amp;#34;the perfect&amp;#34; device, if I could figure out what that would be. If it broke today, I&#x27;d buy another. How&#x27;s that for an &amp;#34;I&#x27;d buy again&amp;#34; recommendation? :)</li>
    <li> They usually burn out after 6-12 months or so. Still worth it.</li>
    <li> These clippers are far superior to the old, standard style trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. I keep my hair between 1/4\\&quot; and 1/8\\&quot;, and it takes maybe 10 or 15 minutes to cut my hair and trim my beard. As the ad states, it cuts in both directions, is elf-sharpening, is easily adjustable via the dial on the handle and can be rinsed under the tap when done. It charges quickly and holds a charge for weeks at a time. I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Most of my reviews are extremely positive because I usually research really thoroughly before making a purchase. However, I was looking for a head shaving mechanism and disregarded a lot of the negative reviews on here and took a chance. I ended up throwing this thing in the trash can the next day. I charged this thing exactly as instructed, and it quit halfway as I was shaving my head. I hated this clipper so much I didn&#x27;t even wanna deal with sending it back. I just decided to use a regular razor instead. Also, while it was working for the 5 minutes that it seemed to, it wasn&#x27;t even cutting the hair down that much, leaving a lot of thick stubble. Forgot this and just use a regular razor.</li>
    <li> My wife passed away. She always cut my hair for me each week. I thought I would try cutting my own hair, but my grandkids laughed at me when they saw the back of my head. I missed spots. This Remington cuts my hair perfectly. It holds the charge very well. The pop out trimmer is useless, so don&#x27;t count on it. Otherwise, if you need to cut your own hair THIS ONE&#x27;S FOR YOU!</li>
    <li> Best short hair (like real short) trimmer on the market. Battery dies after a year or 2, but it&#x27;s warrantied for 2 years. Makes cutting your own hair so easy (along with a mirror) and can be used to trim other hair as well. Great for travel too. I&#x27;m suprised either remington or another manufacturer hasn&#x27;t taken off with this and improved it for use all over.</li>
    <li> This is bigger than what I can buy in stores. They have a much smaller version for more money. This unit replaced one I bought about 7 years ago. I have never paid for a haircut since. Another plus is I go straight to the shower-so no itching for hours after.</li>
    <li> It gives my son a great cut.... he could use it himself, if he wanted to..... no guess work. Great tool.</li>
    <li> Lots of reviews carp about the poor battery life which was certainly true after about 18 months with my first one.  However, savings on commercial haircuts and convenience in the excellent design far outweigh the battery problems.</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for about 1 year (bought it from Hammacher-Schlemmer) It requires recharging after every use. Now it&#x27;s recharge lasts but a few seconds. And I really didn&#x27;t use it much! In other words, it crapped out! Absolutely a piece of junk!!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps Shutting Down ,Waste of Money .Sorry I bought This item. Do Not Buy This Item ,Doesn&#x27;t work as they say .</li>
    <li> These clippers do a fantastic job, only a couple of minutes to cut hair...Now my friends want a set for themselves</li>
    <li> I got this to start cutting my own hair. With three kids and a wife all getting haircuts this really helps stretch out the budget. The nice thing is I can touch up my hair every week. Before I was trying to stretch out trips to the barber shop and my hair was always going from short to shaggy between visits.  I find that the #4 and #3 work well for a nice business looking haircut. I then feather the edges with the #2 setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design:&lt;br /&gt;Fits nice in your hand. The curved cutter is a cleaver design. Overall you can tell that this was designed for self-cutting of one&#x27;s hair. The recharge feature is great. With no cord I can cut my hair standing in the shower (no water) so I don&#x27;t make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for price! This gadget pays for itself in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance:&lt;br /&gt;So far it has worked with little fuss. I do put a few drops of oil (included) on the blades before I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Go against the grain of your hair so the hairs will stand up to get trimmed. I find short strokes work better then trying to use it like a comb. The spots above my ears are the most challenging. I fold my ear down then go up with the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I going to give it 5 stars. Again, the fifth star is for price.</li>
    <li> The longer comb attachment tends to &amp;#34;knock over&amp;#34; my hair. But I have been having good results with the following: I take the guide completely off the trimmer to leave the cutting blades exposed, then hold it at both ends with two hands and a finger on each hand providing a depth gauge. Then I can use it to &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; over my hair at that predetermined height using both hands and the exposed cutting blades having direct access to each hair without its being pushed over by the comb attachment, giving a perfectly even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering modifying the longer of the comb attachments by cutting off all of the comb teeth in the middle (probably using a dremel tool) , leaving only the teeth on the ends as depth guides. But so far the two handed technique described above does very well at cutting my wavy/curly hair to one inch or one and a half inches, whereas the comb attachment tends to &#x27;knock over&#x27; my hair causing an uneven cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent tool that works very well for me now that I&#x27;ve learned its nature and modified its use a bit to my needs. I was considering upping my game to a FlowBee or something similar but now that I&#x27;ve learned this new method I think the Short Cut will work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when the battery dies I plan on cutting the device apart and either installing a new battery or a tether for an external battery. (JB weld is your friend for reassembly. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I foresee this giving me years upon years of convenient use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**absolutely essential to brush this clean and lube it after every time, or even once or twice during a cut. It helps preserve the blades and also keeps the running speed up. I use WD40, Singer sewing machine oil, or anything else that I have around**</li>
    <li> Works so well.  It is so easy to keep my hair very low with this curved shaver. I love it..</li>
    <li> Nicky O  Las Vegas&lt;br /&gt;Great product  doe what they say.  I use it regulary (in bald mode)&lt;br /&gt;but it is ajustable to many choice lengths. It solved my barber problems.</li>
    <li> For very short hair. I had bought one and used it for about 10 months or so. Then it stopped working. Seemed like the battery was drained or disconnected. So I thought I buy another one and return this one cause it was under warranty. After the new one came, I picked up the old one by mistake and found out that it works! Don&#x27;t know what happened and how it fixed itself. I have not been using them much lately cause I&#x27;m in good terms with my barber again :-)</li>
    <li> This is the second one we own. The cut is amazing. Trims fast and can go to almost bald. Easy one-hand use, convenient to store and simple to clean!</li>
    <li> Total junk. I had it for two weeks and then threw it against the wall. Twice...to make sure it was totalled. Yes it cuts hair real well but that&#x27;s the only good thing i have to say about this product. The bad...it is not completely contoured to the shape of your head, my head anyway, so it took a while. It takes forever to charge and is only good for one haircut. Then you have to charge it again. Finally, upon unpacking it from its box you can tell it is cheaply made. It just didn&#x27;t seem like it would last long and it didn&#x27;t. Money down the drain.</li>
    <li> This is a great groomer for the price. The battery does not last that long but it is long enough for you to do the job once it&#x27;s charged. It just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I loved this clipper, but after a few months the battery died and it won&#x27;t work off AC. I got a Philips that works wireless or plugged in and it lasted me a couple years before I had to replace.</li>
    <li> hubby loved this..... when it worked.  that battery thing is an issue (I thought all the complaints were more of &amp;#34;a user error issue.  Nope the thing kinda sucks).  Got it for him to take on vacay so he wouldn&#x27;t have to find someone to do his hair.  perfect for that.  He got about 6 cuttings out of it; which made the price per cutting very inexpensive as the unit was the price of a single cut.  I would buy this again just to take on vacay.</li>
    <li> First off, let me state I&#x27;ve had this item for over a year. I was hesitant on buying it because of the reviews that said the battery didn&#x27;t last very long. I noticed the same thing with mine after using it 3-4 times, but the thing is, its not the battery. Its the blades, they need to be oiled after almost every use. The blades on this thing are huge, way bigger than your average clipper.  As such, they need to be oiled more frequently. It DOES sound like the battery is going dead, even after a charge. But for me, 3-4 drops of oil on the blades, and it sounded better than new.  Most people never oil their clippers and get away with it. With this product, you cant. It comes with oil, use it, you will notice a difference. For the last time, its not the battery. Use the brush it came with, use the oil, and you will love this product!</li>
    <li> Safe &amp; easy to use. I use on the lowest setting &amp; don&#x27;t have to take the time to go to the barber shop. Pays for itself in one month.</li>
    <li> Had been cutting my hair at about a half inch with a Wahl clipper set and hated it.  The clip on guide was a pain and the mess usually resulted in waiting until I was really shaggy before I cut again.  The Short Cut is so easy to use that I have found about 5 minutes once a week keeps my hair just the way I want it.  Very little clean up and really easy to use.  I have had the unit 3 months and so far no problem.  I use the guide comb to trim my hair and then switch to the bald comb for the back of my neck.  The pop up trimmer works to trim sideburns and around the ears but I still prefer a small battery powered clipper type trimmer for around my ears.  The wide curved blade does a great job and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their hair cut short.  FOLLOW UP COMMENT Aug.17, 2015 I have had the short cut for almost two years and just cut my hair this morning.  It still works great, no problem with the battery. I would still recommend the short cut to anyone who wants to save some money by cutting their own hair.</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these.  The clipper works great for about a year, then it cannot hold a charge long enough to clip your hair.  I wish they would make a corded version.</li>
    <li> It will not hold a charge for more than five minutes. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I charge it for two hours or two days it runs completely down in less than five minutes. I bought a second one and had the same problem.</li>
    <li> I HAVE SHORT HAIR.  I USE A #2 CLIP TO TRIM MY HAIR.  I STARTED AT THE HIGHEST (LONGEST HAIR LENGTH) AND WENT TO THE LOWER SETTING UNTIL IT WOULD START TO CUT MY HAIR.  I WAS LEFT WITH AN UNEVEN CUT WITH PATCHES IN MY HAIR.  IT LOOKS LIKE A 2 YEAR OLD CUT MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> Great deal and suits my needs perfectly . Some commented on short battery life .  I don&#x27;t see that as any problem at all .  I use it on the shortest setting once a week and a haircut is done in no time . Cleanup is a breeze ; blow on it and it&#x27;s ready for next week.  It fits my palm and sweeping it back and forth gives me the most even and simplest haircut I could hope for .&lt;br /&gt;I just cant think of any negative issues with this product .</li>
    <li> batteries are terrible</li>
    <li> The best product to do a good close cut. You can do it by yourself or ask your girlfriend but instruct her on how to use it. Recgargable is a great option. Whoever prefers close haircuts will benefit greatly. Recommend.</li>
    <li> It has it&#x27;s flaws.  First off, they should have made it with the option of using it with a cordless or corded feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, even though it stops midway through the haircut, and having to restart it again and again, and not by the on/off switch, but with a screwdriver along side the blades where you need to give it a little extra push to get it going again, because the on/off switch is just not enough to get it going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, many times when it detects a load, meaning when it&#x27;s going through hair that has not been cut in a week or two, it stops, and you will have to use a screwdriver like I do to get it going again.  Cutting my hair which is short normally takes me an hour now, whereas it took 10-12 minutes before is to say the least a real effort on my part.  Cutting your hair with this takes perserverence, and a slow to blow temper. This means no coffee, or caffeine, definitely no energy shots, when using this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having it be just shy of having a goat chew on my head to trim it all down to where it looks acceptable to me, this is the best thing out on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I do see my old barber from time to time, and even he thinks it would be advantageous to stay with the shortcut as it does do a nice job. Though he has mentioned that he misses his $12.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it finally short cut&#x27;s itself out, or when I finally lose my temper with it, I live near a farm where the goats and lamas are plentiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zev</li>
    <li> I keep my hair very short... balding comb short. Usually use my Wahl hair trimmer once a week to buzz it down to the scalp. I saw this Remington product and thought it would be handy... it is... but...    I&#x27;ve tried three times (at varying hair length... up to about a half inch) and I can not get an even cut out of this thing. Sideburn area and around the ears difficult to get to.    In trying to give this thing a fair shhake... I went past my return window... d&#x27;uoh!    My Remington Short Cut has been garbaged and I&#x27;m back to using my old dependable Wahl (will have to see if they make a cordless.)    Anyways... good idea... just didn&#x27;t work for me... I highly DON&#x27;T recommend the Remington Short Cut.</li>
    <li> When you receive your clippers plug it in and insure that it charges at least 24 hours minimum.  When using the trimmer insure that it is fully extended and clips into place.  Now that the two little mishaps that I experienced are out of the way I would like to say that for a close hair cut where no tapering is needed or required they worked very well.  Just run the clippers over your head several times in different directions going back and forth and you will achieve the length of cut selected on the adjustment dial.  The clippers work well for trimming up the perimeter of the hair but I found it very beneficial to have someone else trim across the back of the neck as it is difficult to achieve an even cut doing it by yourself in this area.  The clippers worked well and were easy to clean and lubricate with the enclosed bottle of oil.  I purchased a second for my grandson who also wears his hair short but his mother does the clipping for him.</li>
    <li> I first used this it seemed okay.  Than I started looking at my hair.  Looked like corn rows or something.  I had streaks of hair longer than the other.  Than on one side above the ear you I saw 3 or 4 inch streak that was shorter than the rest.  It was the length of the clipper.  So if you are using don&#x27;t push down to hard.  Let it glide.  The first time I must have pushed down.  Second time I cut my hair I let it glide by it self.  It did okay.  Well it quit working.  Work for 5-10 seconds and just cut off.  Needed cleaning, oiling, or recharge I thought.  Did all and still same thing.  Would work for a few seconds.  Noticed though it wouldn&#x27;t even charge.  No light would come on.  I hope I got a reject.  Needless to say I took them back to the store and got my money back.  I wanted them to work cause less junk with comb guides and etc.  Oh well.  Maybe next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for well over a decade now, ever since it started receding and I decided that paying someone [...] bucks a month to cut it was foolish. I started with a Flowbee, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut short enough (the more I lose, the shorter I want it). I then got a regular Remington home hair cutting kit which served me well for about 7 years, but again I wanted to go shorter. Then I saw the Short Cut as a Gold Box deal, read the description about doing a bald cut, and I knew I had to try it. Am I ever glad I did. This is the fastest, easiest, most worry-free clippers I have ever used. I used to have my wife inspect my head after cutting because I inevitably missed a spot, but because of the bi-directional cutting it is easy to get every last hair. I love the bald cut, and because it is so quick to maintain after the first time, I can cut my hair in minutes, a couple times a week, with minimal clean up. My only complaint is that you cannot use it corded when the battery gets low, but that is a minor inconvenience. I would recommend this clipper to anyone who likes to keep their hair short (there is a longer length comb included) with minimal fuss and repeatable results.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;1)On the 3/16\\&quot; setting, hair is very even (your results may vary).&lt;br /&gt;2)Quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;1)Very Poor quality control. The \\&quot;charging\\&quot; indicator light died after a week.&lt;br /&gt;2)Poor Ergonomics-the on/off switch is under the palm of your hand.  This results in switching the unit off whenever your hold the cutter with anything more than a light touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acceptance:&lt;br /&gt;Overall, and even with the poor quality, I like this product, and use it every other week--after charging it the night before.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that Remington will come out with a \\&quot;ShortCut II\\&quot;, that addresses the poor quality and ergonomics of the ShortCut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington--R U LISTENING?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Move the switch to a place underneath the handle, where it can&#x27;t be unintentionally touched.&lt;br /&gt;2)Have your Chinese manufacturers use better quality components and batteries.&lt;br /&gt;3)Push the cutters/blades out past the nose/handle--that will make it MUCH easier to clip hair around  the ears and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;4)Offer owners of the current ShortCut a 50% discount on the new, refined, model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/2012 Update:&lt;br /&gt;Shortcut is DEAD. Batteries will not accept a charge. This product has such great potential--all for not.</li>
    <li> The Good:  I like how short my hair is with this clipper on it&#x27;s lowest setting. When I&#x27;m finished, I have a pretty even cut.    The Bad:  The bent blade is good because it cuts fast, but bad because it&#x27;s difficult to cut the areas around the ear.     The Ugly:  The red light which is supposed to indicate the battery almost being dead comes on about 5 seconds before the device is dead.    This thing takes HOURS (as in about 36, the charging light goes off) to charge fully, and it will not stay charged between haircuts.(say a period of 3 weeks) Each time I attempt to cut my hair, the buzzer inevitably dies leaving me with half a shaved head and 2 hours to kill while I hope I can get enough juice to finish my hair. The buzzer will not operate even when plugged into the wall once it&#x27;s out of battery, which is just crap given it is designed to give hair cuts.    Even when I&#x27;m cutting 1/8th inch of hair off, the buzzer clogs time and time and time again. I have to move the combs forward and dump the hair each time I make a cut.     All in all, I would throw this thing away if I didn&#x27;t like how short it cuts my hair. 1/8th\\&quot; clips of a regular buzzer go nowhere near as short. I just might anyway, because as I type this I&#x27;m sitting here with a half shaved head, waiting for the POS to charge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice but it works great. It&#x27;s quick, easy, and percise. I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head for years but always needed someone to help with the back, not anymore. It is alittle difficult around the ears but if you have little shaver for side burns and beard your all good. I am very pleased with this product.      Update 9/15/2011:    I&#x27;ve had this product since 2009 and buzz my head 2x a month and it still works, the led for charging burned out and the internal blade cover broke off. I actually came back to maybe buy one and put it in storage for the day this one dies.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The slogan really is true; \\&quot;You can&#x27;t mess this up!\\&quot;   I bought one for myself about a year ago and just bought another as a gift.  You literally hold it like a hairbrush and draw it across your hair as though you were brushing it.  Even the back comes out looking great without a hand mirror.  The only minor flaw I&#x27;ve noted is that, even on a full charge, the unit will hesitate a bit on start-up, as though the batteries were about to die; however it does continue to work and after a minute or so it goes full steam.  Also, it does need to be charged before use -it will not run just by plugging it in.  I use my clipper weekly to keep a fresh cut look and it paid for itself (versus going to a barber) in less than 2 months.  Also, the Amazon price is the best I&#x27;ve found - even less than when I bought my first one elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have this trimmer/clipper for some of the same reasons mentioned... I have almost no hair on top but pleanty on the sides.  I would go to get my hair cut and just get a 2 1/2 all over which suited me fine but it cost me the same as someone with a full head of hair.  I found this clipper at the store and tried it out, it was an answer to my prayers... no more paying for a hair cut.  I used this all the time for over a year but just a few months ago it started to loose the ability to hold a charge... the bad thing is you can&#x27;t use it while it is charging.  It takes forever to charge the thing than it looses the charge after one use.  I would buy again only because it saved me way more than it cost in hair cuts... but it would be nice if you could use it plugged in.</li>
    <li> I basically agree with many of the more recent reviews and will just add my take.  This product is really designed for a person to use on themselves in maintaining a very short close cut hairstyle.  If you are buying this to do summer \\&quot;crew cuts\\&quot; for your kids or often let you hair grow longer and then cut it short occasionally,  I would not recommend this item.  You should buy a more traditional clipper as it does not have the power to cut longer or thicker hair.    Here are my cons.    - The motor is not super powerful and it really needs a full charge to work well.  - The clipper will not run while plugged in and it takes a long time to charge, so plan ahead.  - If you hair is a little longer than usual, start out at a higher setting and work your way down to your usual setting.  - The pop out sideburn trimmer is really not that useful.  It doesn&#x27;t cut around the ears very well, in my opinion.  I use the one on my cordless shaver to do the ears and sideburns.    All that said, if you have short, thin hair and simply want to maintain a close cut hairstyle yourself, then this is much easier to use than a traditional clipper as it fits nicely in your hand and is basically like combing your hair.  It also makes it much easier to do the back of your head and neck area yourself.</li>
    <li> I was unable to get this clipper to cut hair.  I returned it for refund.</li>
    <li> My wife still cuts my hair, but this clipper is easier to use than standard clippers.  It&#x27;s not fancy, but the results match the barbershop option.</li>
    <li> This device is much better than using a more conventional trimmer. It makes little touchups a casual thing--&#x27;oh, I&#x27;m a little uneven on the left--zip-zip--done.&#x27;  Two criticisms: the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge that well, so you gotta keep it plugged in to use it that way. And you can&#x27;t fade. So that nice gradient to shorter hair around the ears? Nope, it&#x27;s all the same length. Maybe there&#x27;s a way, but I&#x27;m too klutzy to get it to work.  Edit 10/8/2011: a year after I bought it, the battery conked out on me. No more charge. For $30 I want something that will last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Remington Short Cut Clipper for about a month now. I like to keep my hair reasonably short (#3 clipper)and, like others, was not happy paying about $15 a month for a 5-minute haircut. Now I just give my hair a weekly quick cut with the Remington. I take it slow and easy and make sure to keep the clipper at the proper angle. No problems, no \\&quot;chunks\\&quot; gouged, no bald spots that nature hasn&#x27;t given me. The only complaint I have (and the reason I deducted a star) is that the clipper&#x27;s pop-up trimmer hasn&#x27;t worked very well for me so I&#x27;ve been using either scissors or the pop-up trimmer on my Norelco shaver for trimming around the ears. I probably would not recommend this clipper to those who keep their hair long or for those who want more complicated haircuts, but for my simple needs the Remington Short Cut Clipper has worked very well.</li>
    <li> The curve does not fit every head.  In fact No one could get a good haircut from it.</li>
    <li> I want to add a point that I did not see a lot in the reviews:  This product is doing great job too when you want to keep long hair!!!  I&#x27;m the alive proof and I&#x27;m impressed about how it was easy to get a decent long cut, let says about one to three inches for me depending of the location; I mean you can also handle the ShortCut clipper to have longer hair in front and shorter in the back of the head.  To realize a long cut, just keep the ShortCut clipper at the end of the hair (not on skull) to remove just some hair and repeat until you have removed what you want.    I&#x27;m sorry Remington but you will have to rename your clipper \\&quot;Short/medium clipper\\&quot;.    Like a lot of people said, I was tired of going to spend time and money to the barber and I was looking for a traditional clipper but I was not ready to cut my hair very short as you know like ¼ inch or something like that.  Then I saw the short cut clipper.  But Remington never said in their documentation that their product was able keep hair longer than ½ inch.  More over, reviewers at Amazon did not really talked about that possibility since a lot of people just want short hair if not skin head!    I saw that some people complained about the long battery charge but I&#x27;m really not afraid about that.  The battery had enough power to do my first hair cut and after a few hours of charge, I remove some more hair to do a perfect job but I&#x27;m sure after some practices, one full charge will be enough.  I think Remington choose a smaller adaptor with lower milliamperes to extend the battery life to a maximum.    So I want to highly recommend this product not only for short cut hair but also for people just wanting to remove some hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent cutting ability and fast to use.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this short cut clipper. It was the easiest equipment to cut my hair and avoid wire managament with other brands.    However, the battery charger is really noise and it takes hours to have full charge. Eventually, without actually really knowing when this component was charged the battery burn out and now I-m back with the tradition wire equipment...    Too bad this was never detected when they release this product to the public....</li>
    <li> This clipper sounds good in theory, being curved to match your head, but unless your head is perfectly round and of the same radius as the curvature of the clipper then it will give an uneven cut.  My head has high spots and low spots, and this clipper couldn&#x27;t reach into the low spots.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> This guys simply didn&#x27;t ship the item and when I tired to message him here, Amzaon said he is no longer on record. I paid but didn&#x27;t get the product.</li>
    <li> This barely cuts hair at all. It will pull at your hair, you will have to stop every 5 seconds to remove hair stuck in the teeth Had to finish the job with the old trusty corded clippers.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because there was nothing below a one star.&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn&#x27;t have to fight to put this device back together. It shouldn&#x27;t  an hour to cut short hair. Did I mention how uneven my hair was?&lt;br /&gt;I have been trimming my own hair for 14 years and never experienced such shame&lt;br /&gt;I will be in touch with the BBB.</li>
    <li> This is the best product of its type. Quick and easy to use certainly beats the traditional hair cutters....</li>
    <li> work great for 2 cuts then the height adjustment warped on one side..so with the plastic guard on side warped ... i am afraid to try it on my hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit for my sides as I tend to leave the top of my hair a bit longer. It&#x27;s okay for what it does. I have really thick hair and have noticed that I have to keep running through the same area a few times to make sure there are no loose length hairs that was missed the first time around. A negative is that the plastic clips can be very pressure sensitive and bends easily. The charge holds for a while though and that&#x27;s a plus for me.</li>
    <li> The item came with a US power cord, instead of an Australian power cord. I don&#x27;t recall this being listed in the description and I thought since I was paying in AUD that I would have been supplied with a AUD item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three &amp; they are just what I need to keep my hair short &amp; neat. As with any rechargeable battery, they end up not holding a charge. A better battery would be great; still has saved me money on hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Although I do not have very thick hair, the Clipper got filled with hair in 1 or 2 passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time you need to follow the following procedure after 1-2 passes&lt;br /&gt;1) Stop the Clipper&lt;br /&gt;2) Remove the comb and wash it under the water&lt;br /&gt;3) Put back the comb&lt;br /&gt;4) Continue trimming your hair and return back to step 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get your hair trimmed once in a month, it is not a product for you. Maybe it is good for people, who is trimming always to bald one or two times in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not recommending this product for monthly hair trimming.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as advertised, there were no surprises. It seems to work ok for simple, military style cuts, and maybe more when I can get the hang of it.  The shipping and delivery were on time and as expected. The packaging material did a good job in protecting the order from damage. Positive experience with the vendor.</li>
    <li> Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut Kit</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer , bough it for my dog , a golden retriever , nice to trim his hair ,I will recommend</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. This was recommended by a relative. Nice quick cut.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this and is saving us so much money by no longer having to go get his hair cut!</li>
    <li> Mine died after using it a few times over a period of 6 months or so...I had let it sit for a while and it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge.  I&#x27;m experienced at replacing rechargeable batteries in these types of devices though and gave this one a shot.  It turned out to be the most difficult battery replacement yet for me - very odd design.  After several hours soldering in new rechargeable batteries, I put it back together....and it was still dead.  It seems like a great design, externally, if only they had put good quality batteries and a good charging circuit.  Obviously, from the many reviews you will find here, Remington put the crappiest, cheapest batteries in it they could find in the supply chain.  That&#x27;s fine if you make them replaceable...this obviously is not.  Also, whatever charging circuit they designed doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> Well, at the end of the day you get what you wanted but blades are not that good. It takes a lot of time to complete the process. You have to go back and forth 100 times to cut evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way the small trimmer is terrible, it pulls your hair rather than trimming it.</li>
    <li> I thought these clippers would work, but the &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; that goes on it, is uneven.  So my hair had lines in it and was uneven when I cut it.  I returned to Amazon and got charged $6 &amp;#34;restocking fee&amp;#34;.  Thanks for nothing!  Dont waste your time or money on these clippers!!!!  Take your $6 and go to a barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my WORST experience on amazon.  EVER!</li>
    <li> This thing just won&#x27;t cut. I went over and over and over, dumping the hair as I went along and my hair was all different lengths. I finally gave up and used my Wahl razor with the attachments. It worked great as a beard trimmer though.</li>
    <li> I bought this clippers around 6 months back. Even though the reviews were average i bought them since their shape and  the looks deceived its ratings. It initially was working fine , the overnight charge lasted for 30mts. But now it hardly lasts 5-10mts even after 24-48 hours of charge. Yesterday it abruptly stopped working and am now shopping around for another clipper..</li>
    <li> The adjustable guard makes this very versitile and easy to use. A good purchase for do it yourself hair stylists.</li>
    <li> bought the clipper in July. Only used it 4 or 5 times(my hair doesn&#x27;t grow fast). Went to use it the other day, no battery life. tried to recharge it but it wouldn&#x27;t recharge. Called company. told me it was probably a bad battery and that they would send a replacement after I sent the receipt. didn&#x27;t want the old one which leads me to believe they know they  have defective batteries in them. Will update when I get replacement whenever that will be. I did like it. Easy to use. Would I buy it again. Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update....received replacement today....about a week after I sent the receipt and a letter explaining the problem. Not a fan of the clipper but I have to give customer service at Remington a thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update number 2.....replacement died today. only used it about 4 or 5 times again. What a piece of junk!!!! good idea..bad execution</li>
    <li> I am writing this review on the occasion of buying my second clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying it again, which speaks to my satisfaction with the product.  It works well, is easy to use, and I enjoy the ease of being able to cut my own hair without constantly asking my wife to spot-check the back of my head for areas I missed with the smaller clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought my last one Sept 2008.  It didn&#x27;t last very long.  In my case, the power supply failed internally.  The rechargeable battery isn&#x27;t replaceable or accessible.  This item is certainly designed for early failure/replacement with regular use.  So long as you aren&#x27;t expecting years of reliable use from this product, you&#x27;ll be satisfied.  And at $35, it isn&#x27;t priced to be an heirloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my fourth one now, and I have found that I can extend the life by being very careful to re-oil the blades after every use.  Not sure how this is related.  Perhaps more regularly oiled blades reduce engine strain and subsequently wear and tear on power system....  Still very happy with how it cuts.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, and gives me the haircut I used to pay $20 for at the barbershop. Right on.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of whether this thing would work, as the other reviews raised the possibility of battery problems, the product having been discontinued, etc.    Having just given myself a haircut (albeit a very short one) for the first time in my life, I must say I am impressed. I charged it over night, and this ingenious little clipper performed as advertised.     It takes a few passes and you need a mirror to ensure that you don&#x27;t miss a spot, but the resulting cut was nice and even. I did not experience any pulling or tugging at my hair, but perhaps that is because I moved it slowly over my head per the instructions. (for reference, I have very straight hair, so maybe that contributed to my success)    I can&#x27;t speak with regard to durability, but it appears to be solidly built and soundly designed. Given that I used to shell out $12+ per haircut, this will save me time and money even if I only use it a few times.</li>
    <li> Three years ago I went from short hair &#x27;business&#x27; hair style to #3/2 buzz cut. To keep up appearances, I spent $10+2 x 2 monthly. Once I tried this clipper, I was able to keep my buzz cut trimmed out once a week and it paid for itself in 30 days.  My original product recently showed battery recharge problems and although it is no longer easily found in local drugstores, I purchased a 2nd online and am very happy with it. I&#x27;m surprised that Remington hasn&#x27;t improved distribution in these times of short hair and limited budgets for the user demographic.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper!  I sport a short haircut usually (3 on top and 1 on the sides and back).  So far I&#x27;ve just done a 3 on all my head and I will attempt to learn how to do a 1 on the sides, blended.  Anyway, this is a great product.  I could have bought other clippers that come with all the attachments, scissors, combs that I don&#x27;t need but why bother when the one attachment I need comes with this one?  Works great, easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much easier to use than a straight clipper and you&#x27;ll end up with an evenly trimmed surface every time! You can practically use this clipper in the dark! :)</li>
    <li> I have had two of these. One DOA the other died after a couple of months. Battery/charging problems. I returned the second one to Remington expecting a replacement. I received a check for the purchase price instead.</li>
    <li> Advertised as not being messy but they get hair everywhere and battery doesn&#x27;t hold charge long at all. Battery takes long time to charge also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for about 6 months.  They are more difficult to use than you would think, and the cut is somewhat uneven.  But the big problem is that after 6 months, the battery can no longer be charged.  It just stays empty.  And unlike the manufacturer&#x27;s claims, these clippers cannot be used when plugged into the wall.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you want your hair no longer than a zero; otherwise, it is very difficult to get an even cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a clipper that&#x27;ll cut my hair really low, virtually bald, and this satisfies all that I&#x27;ve wanted. It&#x27;s a pretty quick, clean shave. Cuts extremely smooth and low. Cleanup is easy. I&#x27;ll recommend, definitely.</li>
    <li> Second one I&#x27;ve purchased..............cheaper than the barber, the results are the same.</li>
    <li> Very good item.. I like it..</li>
    <li> The people who say the battery doesn&#x27;t last long aren&#x27;t kidding. After 6 months of use this shaver has completely lost the ability to hold a charge. Also, the comb style is strange and doesn&#x27;t cleanly glide over some parts of the head/face. You get what you pay for with this unit; cheap &amp; easily broken garbage.</li>
    <li> I agree about the battery life. That said, I just ordered my third one. The battery life is worse in the cold. Charge and store in a warm room. It does do a great job  despite the sub par battery. It has no real competition on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair short(buzz cut) for about three years.  About every three weeks I visit a barber to have my hair cut at $12.00 to $16.00 a cut.  Now with the Short Cut Clipper I cut my own hair every week or so and my hair always looks good.  It is easy you just go front to back and side to side and you&#x27;re done.  I also use it to trim my beard.  This is a back-up I purchased my first one two years ago and it still works fine, I wanted a back-up because I&#x27;d be lost without It. Great product, great price</li>
    <li> I really like it. Very easy to use and now I can do my own haircuts. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to push down the level and end up with patches of shorter hair, so be very careful not to push down on it much.  My son ended up wearing a hat after the first time using this on him because of that.  But he&#x27;s a sweetheart and going to let me try again!  Hopefully next haircut will go better.</li>
    <li> I bought one and after reading the reviews I was nervous about using it. I had never cut my own hair before. It took some getting used to which only lasted a couple of minutes then I got the haircut I like. The second time I used it was a breeze. It only took a couple of minutes. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes short hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my skull or the Remington machine - but it&#x27;s an absolute mismatch between us both.</li>
    <li> This thing make holes in the hair. I´m a doctor, how do I suppose to see patients like that. Stupid machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a normal whalt machine, I thought this thing was a good Idea. I´m going to post pictures of how my hair was.</li>
    <li> Terrific tool if old enough not to care about precision styling.  :)</li>
    <li> Used it 3-4 times, no longer turns on. I honestly really like the product, saves me time trying to get into a barber not to mention money and I&#x27;m mostly satisfied with the results. However I&#x27;ve used it a few times and everything was fine, took it out and now it will not come on, I think the switch is the issue, it accepts a charge and then the light goes out indicating its ready but it will not come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can I&#x27;ll send it back but I don&#x27;t want a refund, I want a working model. I would rate it higher if it was not for the operational failure. As to cutting I think it works very well.</li>
    <li> this machine does an excellent job at what it is intended for ....trimming one&#x27;s hair to a certain length, or even to a bald look.</li>
    <li> This is my second one - the first had lasted for 3 - 4 years - works well, easy to clean and operate, good, even coverage - will keep on buying unless someone comes up with a similar (or better) design.</li>
    <li> I really thought I would love the idea of being able to give myself really quick touchup haircuts with this product. But it just doesn&#x27;t cut very well. I&#x27;m surprised to see his many glowing reviews as I do for this product. It works. But just okay.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd short cut. It does what it says it will do. I cut my hair every two weeks, so I wear it out fast. It is still cheaper than going to the barber every two weeks. It generally last one to 1.5 years.</li>
    <li> For what it advertises it will do, it does...it gives even, decent, cuts. I set the dial to a 2 and simply comb my head saving myself $10 from a 5min barber visit. A bit lower setting takes care around my ears. Beware though, whoever designed the power button position must have been a schoolyard jokester because it will seemingly ignite at the slightest touch like a toy handshake buzzer! Why it isn&#x27;t on the upper side instead of the back for easier thumb control should be rethought. It does not seem to hold a charge either (which I understood from other&#x27;s reviews) so I have to charge it before use but all in all, I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now so it has already paid for itself...so far anyway.</li>
    <li> I got it yesterday and used it immediately. It&#x27;s a excellent product and works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the one if you want to fade hair evenly yourself.</li>
    <li> Best purchased I could have made</li>
    <li> Excellent product, use it a couple of times per week.  Much faster and better job than using the old fashioned type od clippers for a &amp;#34;Buzz Cut&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> When I received the clipper I figured I would have to charge it first.  Sure enough.  According to the instructions it needs 24 hours for the first charge.  I gave myself a haircut and put it back on the charger.  Some weeks later I gave myself another cut-- no problem.  Put it back on the charger. On the third attempt the charge was so small I could only get a few seconds out of the battery.  Since then it hasn&#x27;t recharged. Lousy, lousy battery/charger.</li>
    <li> Excellent device as of one month owning it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, I normally just use the #2 setting, but have use the #1 setting for summer and it cuts perfectly. I also use it to trim my beard and does a great job. I like the fact that I can use it twice a week. Battery life is more than enough and  I only charge it once every two weeks and haven&#x27;t notice that it requires a charge. I use to have a corded clipper and the cord always got it the way and it required much more work to accomplish what I now achieve effortlessly.</li>
    <li> the title says it all.  this clipper worked well 15-20 times.  After that, it stopped holding a charge.    not bad for the price (cheaper than a barber!)</li>
    <li> The Remington failed within 30 days out of the box.  Remington no longer makes this product so they can&#x27;t do any thing for me.</li>
    <li> When you purchase this product you get exactly what you pay for. The only cut it can give is a buzzcut. It gives a good buzz after about fifteen minutes of work but the only drawbacks are that it is difficult to get around the ears and it consistently needs banged out as you work. I highly recommend this if all you want is a buzzcut and I also recommend using the balding comb when it is hot outside.</li>
    <li> Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut kit    Great product design.  The curved edge makes trimming hair or beard very easy, very fast. Unfortunetly due to the battary they use in the device, it does not hold a charge very well at all, even when new.  Consequently you have to charge it prior to every use.  If they would produce one of these that can be used while plugged in, or with a better battary, it would be a very in demand item.     I do like the item (I&#x27;ve had two) and will continue to use it, but the battary technology is very, very poor.    Remington should re-introduce the product with a different power source design that works better. PLEASE!!!</li>
    <li> This haircutter works like a charm. It is curved to fit the head and adjustable.Saves a fortune on barber shop costs.</li>
    <li> I just received this item.I hope it will work properly.So far I have no issues at this time.Remington products are supposed to be good.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the actual cutting okay, however, this unit has serious problems with the internal charger.    Unit doesn&#x27;t want to charge when it&#x27;s low- I left it with a full charge months ago, so the device still thinks that it had a full charge before I started cutting my hair.  Knowing this, I plugged in the charger, but it will not charge.  Not certain what to do, I started cutting my hair.    In the middle of my hair cut, the thing quit on me.  And it takes about a day or more to fully recharge.</li>
    <li> After getting the clippers, I was extremely excited to find a foolproof way to trim my boyfriend&#x27;s hair or even he could do it himself. Unfortunately, the first couple times using this device has been a bit of a miniature disaster ending in discomfort, hair-pulling, uneven overall cut, and bald spots.    These clippers are not recommended for those with thick, curly hair.  The arrangement or even the sharpness of the blades make it useless if not dangerous for said persons.    The only pros I can think of are the slim, compact look of the clipper and how it indeed offers various settings to toy with.  I think that it is a bargain.  Additionally, it is RELATIVELY easy to clean the hair from the clippers themselves.  However, cleaning after yourself when this thing flings hair all over your bathroom floor is a different story.    The other cons unrelated to hair types are the battery life and the quality of the parts.  The battery life is extremely short.  It takes hours to fully charge.  Once charged, hope to God that you have hands quicker than lightning or you may end up with half your hair untrimmed.  Secondly, the parts that it comes with are thin and flimsy.  I have not broken anything yet but you must be extra gentle when cleaning the clippers because the guide bars are made of very flimsy plastic.  You must pull very hard to get it out to clean and each time I wince because I think it&#x27;ll snap in half.  I think they should have stuck with a more sturdy material.  Lastly, the contour of the clippers leaves some areas of hair longer than others.  Areas of concern are on the sides right above the ears.  It must be complemented with other clippers.    I probably won&#x27;t buy this again for anyone but it was a nice concept that needs some development.</li>
    <li> Pros:  1. The curve design is fine; makes it easy to get an even cut.             2. Light weight and very portable, easy to hold.              Cons:  1. Switch is in a bad location.                                   Fred, Milford, N. J.</li>
    <li> Fully expected this to be one of those items you have to try because of the price and bury in a drawer with all of the other disappointing gadgets.    To my surprise it really works.  Spend a minute or 2 every morning \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; my hair with it and it maintains a good clean cut.    Even tried it on my neck and beard with not so great results, but in all fairness it isn&#x27;t advertised as a beard groomer.</li>
    <li> Great product for short hair. My first haircut with the clippers, was as good as any barbers haircut. No more monthly trips to a barber. Save money,time,gas,etc. Every haircut the way I want.</li>
    <li> I like the concept of this, it&#x27;s easy to hold and it&#x27;s cordless so you can stand in the shower to contain the mess, but it&#x27;s slow and tedious to use.  It doesn&#x27;t get very much hair in a single pass, so you have to go back and forth and back and forth, and when you&#x27;re done it&#x27;s still not very even.  I used it on the longest setting, so perhaps it would be better on a shorter setting, but i don&#x27;t want my hair that short, so I&#x27;ve given up on this thing.</li>
    <li> Single greatest home hair self-cutting clippers ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t order this device as I thought it looked gimmicky, but with Amazon&#x27;s friendly return policy, I gave it a shot.  And I&#x27;m sure glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a shortcut and don&#x27;t feel like always heading to the barber, this is for you.  I&#x27;ve never been able to give myself a fade as easily as I can with this clipper.  It&#x27;s shape is perfect, and it takes a fraction of the time for the same results as standard hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything about the longevity of this unit, but for the price, I just hope Remington continues to produce them because I will buy again when these die.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington Short Cut as a simple means to cut my hair.  Before I used it,  I watched the instructional video and some people posted videos on you-tube, with their personal experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I use the number 1 setting, which I believe is 3.2 MM, when I cut my hair with the traditional hair clippers.  This has a number one setting, which according to the instructions is right around the same length as the traditional hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has some postives and some negatives.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the positives,&lt;br /&gt;-Its easy to use, and its works very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Its lightweight and fits comfortably in the palm of your hand&lt;br /&gt;-The curved structure fits the shape of your head, and your able to access the hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was cutting my hair, it didn&#x27;t seem like it was actually taking hair off, but when I was finished I can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives,&lt;br /&gt;-It seems like when you get done cutting your hair, you have to use the traditional hair clippers to &amp;#34;clean it up&amp;#34; sort of speak.&lt;br /&gt;-I noticed in a you tube video the gentleman who used the product appeared to have the same problem, and he had to use the traditional clippers to shape it, even it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feeling is, if I have to use the traditional clippers to even it out, than I can just use the traditional clippers for the entire haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again to see if maybe the more I get used to it, the less likely I would have to revert to the traditional clippers to finish the haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then, I would say this is average at best.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect clipper to use when you plan to shave your head by yourself...It&#x27;s much easier than the traditional straight clippers...You must charge the clipper over night in order to use it the next day..You can&#x27;t plug it in and use it....I&#x27;ve went thru at least 3-4 of them in five years....I shave my head once a week and this clipper makes it a breeze...I think the lifetime of these are 1 year, but one year of use is still worth it, think about all the money you save from going to the salon..</li>
    <li> Being cheap, I usually get my hair cut too short (which my wife is not a fan of), and then wait too long for the next cut. I received the Short Cut Clipper this week and, in less than half the time it would take me just to drive to the barber, used it to cut my hair to about the length it would be midway between my usual cutting cycle. Because the product is so easy to use, I plan to use it weekly to keep my hair at its current length. It&#x27;s easy to use: just &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; your hair with it in several directions. I have not used the built-in clipper attachment (I have regular clippers that I use around my ears), but so far I am quite satisfied. And it will pay for itself halfway through the second time I use it.</li>
    <li> After just 6 or 7 uses, the shaver will no longer work or cut after recharging.  Turns on for about 10 seconds and shuts itself off.  This is a great idea for use in between real haircuts but alas the product is junk.</li>
    <li> Expected a lot from big name Remington. Unfortunately, this clipper does not charge properly.. if not at all. hair goes inside the unit and on the dial window. Trimmer does not stay fully extended, like its supposed to. with the unit on, it just shakes the trimmer back to its place, rendering it useless. such a waste of concept could have been a good product. Needs a better implementation of battery/charging unit.</li>
    <li> Great hair clipper. Just what I needed to trim the back of my neck. Don&#x27;t have to go to the barber as often.</li>
    <li> It is O.K.  It does take time getting used to, but overall it does the Job. I still thing for the 1st Lower cut style  I could get away with a standard Clipper, and then I could finish off with this due to curvature of the Clipper, but Charge and Power less then Expected.</li>
    <li> The best !!! to save money by cutting your own hair</li>
    <li> Internal battery is a problem:  Dead within 6 mos.</li>
    <li> The power can not last long. I need to charge twice to finish my hair cutting</li>
    <li> I try on my son, he got fine hair, its not working at all, very week, worthless...and waist of money...</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I really like how easy this is to use.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful you set it on the right setting or you&#x27;ll have no hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for fast touch-ups</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reports of short battery life, but I found that you just need to OIL THE BLADES!  Makes sense that this trimmer would slow down and stop without oil because the blades are, at least, twice as long as any other trimmer product.  I could be wrong and there could be a battery problem, but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have find this is the best trimmer I have used for the whole-head: Both hair and beard.  I have a box of 10 or more trimmers that all work about the same more or less.  This is a better design.  You have to be a little creative to figure out how to position it around the temples to get close, but everywhere else THE LONG CURVED BLADES GIVE A VERY EVEN AND FAST CUT.  Especially on the head where there are dips.  The usual 1.5 inch wide trimmers cut down into the dips in the back of the head and the cut always looks uneven.  This 3 inch wide blade evens out the dips by not cutting down into them.  It makes a much better looking finish.  It is also faster because it cuts twice as wide in one pass.  After every cut brush it off and OIL it and plug it into the charger.</li>
    <li> Ordered the clipper for my Dad&#x27;s birthday.  He is absolutely happy that he doesn&#x27;t have to go to the hairdresser anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It works great.  I just ordered another one for my brother.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it anytime.  Shipping time was really quick too.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This is a great product for someone who wants to be &amp;#34;almost bald&amp;#34; - not quite Mr. Clean level, but pretty close. That said, I have to rebuy it about once a year because the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge and it&#x27;s difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Only issue I have is the indicator number for the cut height is hard to read. I don&#x27;t want to grab my reading glasses everything I need a trim. If you keep it at one height all the time, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for you.</li>
    <li> These clippers have worked good for me.  I use it every Sunday to tighten things up.  Its super simple to use; works much like using a comb.  It keeps my hair under control and looking reasonably good for six months.  At which point, I will go see the regular barber for a professional buzz cut.  It has a little dial to adjust the guard which works great. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the re-chargeable battery and I have had it for quite a while.</li>
    <li> My Rate reflects the Great Service provided,&lt;br /&gt;I liked the accurate dates and quaity of the received product&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended this to all buyers</li>
    <li> Works very well, recharges quickly.</li>
    <li> Only lasted about 8 months, died after that. That´s why I give it 1 star. But when working it had a great anatomical format.</li>
    <li> This little thing rocks!!! I had got this out of curiosity as it was relatively cheap and I had seen many good reviews. But, today as I was wondering I needed to stop by my barbershop once again told myself to gently try it and see how it looks like. This little thing is a gem! In 5 minutes I trimed my hair like a semi-pro that I couldn&#x27;t believe. I was really impressed. At least, it put off me going to the barbershop by some time. Fantastic product and a very nice idea. I strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the only one I know of that allows you to shave your own head this easily. I use this once a week to keep my hair buzzed short and it takes maybe 5 to 10 minutes each time. You basically use it like a comb in long strokes. After many, many months of use, one of the plastic clips came lose after cleaning it, but it didn&#x27;t impair function, particularly after placing the guide back on (I use the shaver on its lowest possible setting for the closest possible cut--I still have a full head of hair, but it looks better and is easier to manager closely cut). Frankly, for as little as this costs, I don&#x27;t mind buying a new shaver once a year or so.</li>
    <li> This is my second Shortcut.  I bought one right when they were first released and I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it.  It makes getting my hair cut down to near nothing a breeze compared to using traditional clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning, I use it with the balding comb and set the guard to it&#x27;s lowest height.  The result is equivalent to about 2 days after shaving my head with a razor; longer than day-old stubble, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shortcut makes it easy to get my hair cut evenly so I don&#x27;t miss patches like I&#x27;ve done before with traditional clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really thick hair, or let it grow too long the Shortcut may not be the best tool to knock it down.  I&#x27;ve had a few times where I needed to buzz my hair first with clippers and then clean it up with the Shortcut.  When I go more than 2 or 3 weeks between trims is when this is needed most.  Otherwise I try to clip my hair weekly or every 2 weeks and the Shortcut works great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beef is that you can&#x27;t use this while plugged in.  So if the battery is dead you&#x27;re not getting a cut.  Also the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Mine will now only hold a ~10 minute charge and it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s not running the motor nearly as powerfully as when it was new.  I&#x27;m going to hack my original Shortcut now that I have the new one and see if I can bypass the charging safety circuit so it can be used plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the battery problems, I like this tool.  Even if I have to buy one yearly, that&#x27;s a heck of a lot less than paying for a haircut every 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect if you want to get a close shave without using a razor. The cordless feature makes this product perfect for using it outside which pleases my wife becuase the clipped hair stays out of the house!</li>
    <li> This is the second Remington Short Cut I&#x27;ve owned. The first one failed due to my carelessness. Admittedly, it can be a little messy with the clippings but the results achieved are well worth it. I&#x27;ve always maintained a crew cut which this instrument is perfectly suited. I have purchased two as gifts and the recipients have been as pleased with the results of their hair cuts as I have with mine. It pays for itself after just a couple of trims.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every other week.  He does keep his hair as short as possible.  THis is his second one and the first lasted for years.</li>
    <li> I love the design! But it has poor battery life will eventually die completely, and cannot work corded. It&#x27;s another one of those great designs screwed-up by making them with substandard Chinese quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this item was bad enough that I don&#x27;t want anyone else to buy it without knowing that it simply isn&#x27;t powerful enough to cut hair. I have thick hair, but it&#x27;s not abnormally thick. It&#x27;s average. I fully charged the clipper and started cutting. You can hear the blades physically slow when they come into contact with your hair. You brush back and forth, pull it away to have a look--and there&#x27;s hardly any hair there. Nothing has been cut off. I&#x27;ve used many different clippers before, but I&#x27;ve never come across one this weak.</li>
    <li> This product does not cut your hair even.  The shape of the product is highly dependent on the shape of your head, and if it is not close, you have your work cut out for you! I like the rechargeable battery though...</li>
    <li> the charge is so good. it hold over night and i am wright thing this review a year later form the day i got it. its still work as good as the day i bought it. I used this on my self and my pets. well on pets its great because of no cord. but not good on the clips. if you need a bald shave work best for dogs  and humans. i told a few of my co-workers about this product and email them a video on youtube.com on this and they went to buyfrom amazon as soon as they got done watching the video.</li>
    <li> Have had 2 of these over last year.  Bought first one brand new on auction website, worked great, wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge more than a few minutes ... never ready when I wanted to use it.  Thought that may be a fluke  as I have a cordless Remington foil razor and Remington cordless beard trimmers that are excellent and hold charges great.  I bought another packaged one, the newest model, unfortunately exact same results.  If I forget to charge it for 1-2 hours before wanting it, I&#x27;m SOL.  Great curved pattern for nice even cut, but with the lack of a good charge it frequently doesn&#x27;t even hold a charge long enough to get 1 good cut.</li>
    <li> I used to have to set a shaver and tweak and tweak at my hair until finally getting it to look right.  Now I just use this and set the setting to whatever height that I want (usually setting 2) and shave.  Its fast and easy.  I hardly need a mirror.  Thank you, whoever took the time to think of, and develop this idea!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had four of these. I have to replace it every year because the power system dies out. It was poorly designed, and is pretty predictable. First, the blue charge indicator light will go out, then the battery will work for less and less time, whenever you use it. Eventually, it&#x27;ll start turning off the minute you place it on your head, and at that point, it is curtains. Remington had a great idea with this product, but to make it inexpensive they had to sacrifice on quality. It WILL break, however, consider how much money you spend on haircuts (especially when you keep your hair at a 2, like me) and the cost of this item is justified. I may have to get one every year, but it beats going to the barber shop. Word of advice, don&#x27;t try and replace the battery pack. Once you take this piece of crap apart, it is impossible to reassemble.</li>
    <li> At first glance, this novel design seems to be a great solution for very short hair.  But, there are more cons than there are pros. The round cutting surface doesn&#x27;t always match the shape of my head everywhere, like the back and sides, so I don&#x27;t get an even cut everywhere.  The combs are very uncomfortable on the scalp.  The setting that I really want is somewhere between the preset lengths. The motor does not have that nice high rev that beard trimmers have.  It always sounds like its low on power.  It&#x27;s difficult to clean.  You end up with hair all over the sink and counter.  My opinion is don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.  Instead, get a quality hair or beard trimmer with a wide cutting head with a vacuum feature to capture the cut hair.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product. I have been looking for something like this for sometime now. It&#x27;s ideal for that short stubble look for hair and beard. What really makes this product is the contoured head. Cutting your hair is as simple as running a comb or brush thru it. If you want that look BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> I note in the fine print that this has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Perhaps that is because of battery issues. After 7 months, mine no longer holds a charge. It did an okay job from the start, but with noticeable \\&quot;engine revving\\&quot; at times, and did cut my hair almost as short as I would have liked. After a few months, I noticed that it seemed less powerful, but it still worked. Today, it started up loud and strong but immediately lost steam when I touched it to my head. My hair is very short at its longest, and I&#x27;m guessing this would have ceased working with longer hair even more quickly than it did for mine.    I cut my hair once or twice a week, so this saved me a good deal of time and money compared to barber visits. But I&#x27;m moving on to another clipper.</li>
    <li> By far this is the best trimmer I have ever owned... when it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now buying a third one. Seems they lose the ability to charge ~1 years time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that has saved me a lot of money. It works better than I thought it wood. If your first use is on long hair don&#x27;t even worry about it because it cuts hair in very small pieces. My dog loves it.</li>
    <li> The Short Cut clipper is a very useful and money saving device.  This is my second purchase of the Short Cut.  I am nearly bald, and crop my hair very short.  A trip to the barber was always full price, and that was repeated about every 10 days.  I spent quite a lot of money at the barber shop.    Two years ago I bought my first short cut clipper, and I was surprised by its effectiveness, the only expense was the initial cost.  The device is bidirectional, and cuts effectively whether sliding it front to back or the reverse.  It works great for eye brows on the shortest two settings.  The Short cut has a small extendable blade for close trimming of the hair in hard to reach areas.     There is an adjustment for length,with a range from 1/8 to a little less than an inch.  Perfect for me, but not for all.  I recently discovered that the batteries are not replaceable, and should be removed and disposed of properly before discarding the Short cut when they will no longer hold a charge  That is a is a small price to pay for nearly 100 hair cuts.</li>
    <li> I am a 76 year old senior --- I love the clippers --- I shave my face and head about once a month --- I have just ordered my fourth set --- the batteries give out ---</li>
    <li> If you already have buzzed hair and just want to keep it trimmed then this is the thing for you.  However if you have longer hair and think this will buz it down for you it won&#x27;t.  Long hair just lays down flat and the trimmers go right over it taking off a little at a time.  Took me about an hour to work down to a point where I had a nice even buzz cut.</li>
    <li> it was OK for the first few uses but then the battery just kept holding less of a charge. Got to use it about once a week for 3 months then it would charge at all.</li>
    <li> The Remington Short Cut Clipper is an excellent replacement for traditional clippers. The curved blade &amp; 1/2 height knob adjustment make this clipper fast &amp; easy to use. No forgetting to raise or lower the &#x27;handle&#x27; on a standard clipper, just dial in the height you want &amp; comb through your hair.  My first unit lasted two years before the battery stopped charging, but at the cost of only 2 haircuts, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 years now and am on my third one.  I like the stubble look on my head, and can go 2 days between cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curve of the blades is what makes this cutter unique, and it fits my head pretty well.  A goo stubble cut every 2 days takes about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Effective for stubble look&lt;br /&gt;- First one I bought 5 years ago was $50+, so the price on Amazon is a bargain&lt;br /&gt;- Quality seems to have improved over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- You will probably only get 2 years out of it due to battery life issues.  Aside from the environmental impact, for &amp;#60;$35 it is well worth using for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;- If you want a very close bald shave, this device will not go that close to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;- Needs to be cleaned every week or 2 to keep the hair from clogging it up.  Cutting longer hair, like body hair, will definitely clog it up and once that happens it is really not possible to open the unit up and unclog it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have been happy with this product, I just wish it had a better battery that would last 3 or 4 years.</li>
    <li> nice took me less then five min. Comfortable in your hand.close uniform cut</li>
    <li> Quick and easy buzz cut.  It is adjustable and easy to use.  Great for touch ups in between full cuts to keep you clean.  Makes a great manscaper also.</li>
    <li> it is as supposed to be.  batteries don&#x27;t fail prematurely -just put a drop of oil on the blades when they seem to slow down.</li>
    <li> Have used this over 5 times since receiving it. Perfect cut every single time!</li>
    <li> I think this works great. Easy to use and has a nice clean cut. I did not have the battery issues others had. My first Short Cut lasted close to 6 years. This is my second one. The only issue I have is that cutting around your ears, it doesn&#x27;t get that close. I have to use my other clipper, with a smaller head, to get in tight.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers, but as other reviewers have noted, they don&#x27;t last very long when fully charged. You really have to hurry up and clip your hair before the battery dies. I liked that the older version could be used when plugged in. These do have a better design than the older version though, offering smaller incremental hair cut lengths.</li>
    <li> Second one. 2 hair cuts and paid for. Just wish they offered new blades</li>
    <li> i have been using it frequently as it is easy to use and cut very well.</li>
    <li> It always feels as if it is losing power regardless of how long I charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also doesn&#x27;t get as close of a buzz as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Had to admit wondered about quality of this product. To my surprise it performed and did a excellent hair cutting job. I wish to have purchased it sometime ago. For the price and ease of operation very glad I bought this devise...Happy Happy customer...</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and arrived right on time. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. The cut is uneven.The blades stay perpendicular to your head, so what gets cut, gets cut, the rest is just as is. Good concept, but the ambidextrous design is a problem. Make it flippable i.e. tilt the blades in direction of the cut and it will cut better.  Better off buying something that is professional.</li>
    <li> Long time for recharge</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a great idea, but quality is low. Battery and/or motor seem to be very under powered. Often the unit will not start at all.</li>
    <li> Good idea.  Needs work.  Does not cut as close as I would like.  Sort of a long stubble cut at best.  Curved blade is OK on curved parts of the head but not so much on flat areas.  I also tried it without the comb and that was a little closer but I didn&#x27;t like the blade directly touching my skin.  You do have to make multiple passes as it can leave a few isolated hairs uncut.  Might work better for a full head of hair without bald spots.  Battery works OK but I would prefer a cord.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Better for short hair, like mine.  Not gonna be as fast (or costly) as professional shears, but hey- you can use it at home.  No driving or paying for a cut.  Been using mine over 2 yrs, works great.</li>
    <li> On paper, this seems like a nice way to clean up between hair cuts, or even replace trips to the barber shop altogether if you&#x27;re adventurous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works fairly well, and the guides allow you to be sure you&#x27;re not taking off a little too much, and allow you to dial in to the right length pretty closely.  Functionally, the short cut delivers on the simplicity of trimming your hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem, and the cause for the poor review, is that like many others, my clipper only held a charge the first time I used it.  The second time I tried, it died halfway through.  Thankfully, it was only a cleanup, so I charged it a bit more and evened out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, while I like the Short Cut itself, I can&#x27;t say I would recommend it, because as many others have indicated, battery problems are fairly rampant.  It&#x27;s been a long time since I bought mine--and I haven&#x27;t used it more than twice for that reason--but it&#x27;s also possible they&#x27;ve rectified the problem with newer models.  Me, though?  I&#x27;m not going to take the chance on buying another...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but it&#x27;s easy to use and seems to be high quality.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems recharging either.</li>
    <li> This works great for the hair on your head. You can easily set the length you like. It does not work so well on beards, but it isn&#x27;t advertised as such. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> We purchased this again because the old won stopped working - had it a long time and really enjoy it. You will too.</li>
    <li> after a few months it will not stay charged.</li>
    <li> When I found these on Amazon I thought this just what I&#x27;m looking for to keep my hair cut short without having to get my wife to come outside and clipper my head for me! They did not disappoint! It took a couple of times doing it to figure out what setting I wanted to use, (1 with the pre-attached comb they come with) but once I did, it has been great ever since! I hop in the shower and five minutes or so later I&#x27;m washing all those little hairs down my drain!&lt;br /&gt;One piece of advice I would give to a new purchaser would be if you rinse them off in the shower, be sure to dry them well and oil the blades and run them for a few seconds every time. If you don&#x27;t the blades will stick and it won&#x27;t turn on. Other that issue these were a great find.</li>
    <li> I orderd a set of clipper combs for a hair trimmer model HC 8017. They sent me the combs in a short time but... they did not tell me that parts for the HC-8017 were no longer made even though they listed them on the invoice and web site. The newer combs do not fit, the clipper machine is ok but the combs are now held in place by rubber bands I am so disapointed in the advice and sales from Reminton I doubt very much if I ever order anything else from them again. When these newer style combs break I will purchase a different brand of hair clipper.</li>
    <li> Terrible has used it twice and stopped working</li>
    <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t hold its charge. Useless.</li>
    <li> I used it 3 times, it paid for itself. I really like how easy it is to use. Happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> Is a very useful and comfortable to use, has met my expectations. It muysuave to use and the different depth levels are adequate. It must begin with the highest to avoid mistakes</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t do without it. Has saved me hundreds of dollars at the barber.</li>
    <li> I just looked on Amazon and saw that I bought this 2 years ago.  I&#x27;m pretty impressed it is still working.  If you buzz your head every couple of weeks. like I do, you should get this.  I agree that it does not hold a charge too well and can sometimes jam in my hair but I&#x27;m married and I hate hair so I don&#x27;t really care.  I start out on 3 and go down from there to mostly a buzz cut.  I use it without the screen to do the back of my neck.  I have a beard trimmer that I use on sideburns because it does not do those well.  I find it easy to clean and I&#x27;d bet it has saved me at least $200 over the 2 years I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband needed! So easy to use, and all the cut hair falls in the shower instead of bathroom sink when clippers our used. Cuts short too, that&#x27;s the most important part.</li>
    <li> If you want to save money by not going to the Barber anymore this is a low priced option. If you just want a basic short haircut with not a lot of style and don&#x27;t mind doing it yourself. The clippers are very well made. I would recommend to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Love this little clipper. I use it on 2 once a week. I&#x27;m not better looking but I am well groomed. Update: 6 months of fairly regular use and I still love this thing. I keep it plugged in when not in use and I&#x27;ve yet to run out of charge.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does a good job.  I really like the clippers.  Short hair guys should use and save money. For families like my anut&#x27;s with 5 boys it can be a major money saving appliance...</li>
    <li> The Remington Short Cut Clipper is a wonderful gadget for a haircut.  Used it on my husband&#x27;s hair and also on my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product for the time when one cannot go to the barber, or to the beauty salon.  It is easy to use even on my own head.</li>
    <li> I say buy this product, you cant go wrong. Wish I would have had this years ago. This is great if you like your sides short with partial full top hair. You can set the guide to shorten long hair, so if you like it long, move the clipper slow and clean by blowing every 2 passes max. Found that the slower you move it the more even the cut. Soldiers would love this. None of the other issues I read about. I think a lot of products get a bad wrap because of abuse and neglect of battery charge.</li>
    <li> Product as expected and shipping time was very good</li>
    <li> Works well for my needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but so far I&#x27;m delighted. I called this l&#x27;il bits because thats how it cuts your hair. Chops it into tiny bits that go everywhere. It cuts very well and you don&#x27;t have to worry about chopping too close here and there. The guides work well although they do seem a bit flimsy. I keep expecting them to fall off the unit. I&#x27;ll have to see how they hold up.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to trim my beard and it works great. Lots of l&#x27;il bits.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the location of the on/off switch. I keep turning the unit off while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this occasionally for 4 years I experienced the same battery issues as others. Charged all night and it only runs for 5 minutes. Eh..change my rating to 1 1/2 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased one from Amazon.  It works just as stated.  However be careful as if you want a short cut you HAVE to be sure you have the right blade cover.  This is really important otherwise you will be left with almost no hair.  Also be careful with the settings wheel.  It can be easily changes while using the machine.  Remington should really revise its location and make more enfasis on the use of the right blade cover!!  Other than that it really works and quite well at that.  Thats why only four stars</li>
    <li> This thing is great. SO MUCH better than any other clippers I&#x27;ve used. Everything about it is thoughtfully designed, and I have no complaints. If you&#x27;re debating (like I did for several weeks while I shopped around) don&#x27;t bother--just buy it!</li>
    <li> Truth be told?  I ordered this for my cat.  I admit it.  But now I only use it on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has got to be one of the most interesting hair clipper ideas I have ever seen.  It&#x27;s certainly quirky, but it works, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an Oster professional trimmer that I love, but there was one day at the end of the summer where I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t feel like unpacking it.  I really needed a trim, so I took this Remington, which I had purchased, as I said, for my long-haired cat, and, having not used it on the cat yet, I tried it myself.  I put on the plastic guide, set it on the \\&quot;longest\\&quot; hair setting, and went to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it actually did a really good job.  Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those products that you think to yourself, \\&quot;what is this, the new version of the Flo-Bee?\\&quot; and no one would blame you for thinking so.  But I&#x27;ve used it on my goatee (or van-dyke, to be accurate) and it worked just fine.  It has a sideburn trimmer on the side above the power button that does an amazingly good job.  It&#x27;s very accurate, solid, and I used it to do the close work on my beard with excellent results as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a device that you could really use every day if you wanted a fresh trim.  In a couple of minutes, you&#x27;re done.  Look, this isn&#x27;t a salon-calibre haircut you&#x27;re going to get from this, but if you or your kids like really short hair in the summertime, then you&#x27;re going to save a fortune on barber fees with this in the bathroom drawer.  And hours of barbershop time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it for everyone then?  Not a chance.  But this light weight, rechargable clipper will give good clean no-nonsense and yes, short haircuts that look good in no time, with just a few passes over your head, as if you were combing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, you could buy it for your cat.  I&#x27;m still considering trying it on her, but I like having it around just for me, and the cat keeps giving me strange looks whenever I consider it...</li>
    <li> I have read about this product in several places, and all gave it a thumbs-up.  As I am not crazy about paying a barber $15 (plus tip) for a haircut, I decided to buy one through Amazon, as I could not find one in any of the local stores.  So far, I have given myself two haircuts, the second being better than the first - due to experience, I guess.  However, it won&#x27;t style your hair, and you&#x27;d better like your hair short and without a part.  You do need to read the instructions first.  Only problem is that you can&#x27;t do a very good job on trimming the back of your neck and around the ears as you can&#x27;t see what you are doing very well, even with a mirror, so I had to enlist assistance from my wife in those areas using the pop-up clipper.  She doesn&#x27;t particularly like doing that, but it takes only a couple of minutes so she doesen&#x27;t complain a lot.  The product does pretty much what is claimed for it, and if you like a buzz cut, it works fine.  In my case, it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> First things first - does the product work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely - as advertised. I used it just 3 days ago and I had no problem doing most of it by myself. I just needed a little help on the back and around the ears, but I probably could have done that with a little more creative mirror work. The charge held well and the cut is even and nice-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire process is time-consuming. It took me over an hour and a half from prep time through clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why so long?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this little thing creates a lot of mess with little bitty pieces of hair so I cut my hair in the garage so I had to move cars and such. I DO NOT recommend using this clipper in your house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of those little hairs get caught up in the clipper so I had to stop frequently, remove the guard/comb and dump those hairs in the garbage can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still needed someone else to help around the ears and the back of my head. If you were going for the lowest setting this may not be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweeping up takes a while and you&#x27;ll have to shower afterwards. I was shocked at how many little bits of hair came off in the shower. I had to clean the drain trap out more than a dozen times while showering afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have to decide for yourself if it is worth all of the hassle. Personally, I found that I would save time and hassle by going to my barber getting my traditional buzz cut, even with the driving time included.</li>
    <li> When ordering this item through Vine, I figured it was just another hair clipper.  In fact, it&#x27;s a hair clipper designed to cut in the back and on the sides, where \\&quot;normal\\&quot; clippers have a bit more problem.    Although not what I expected, it&#x27;s a great product - saves a lot of time and hassle and does its with a much-reduced likelihood of horrific accidents.  I&#x27;ve managed to have my hair cut using just this and a decent pair of scissors on the top - by someone I might not have trusted otherwise!      Some caveats, though:  You could easily shave your head bare if you didn&#x27;t pay attention to the instructions and what you&#x27;re doing.  So do read the manual before beginning - unless baldness is part of your look.  Also, as many have mentioned, it takes what seems like a long time to fully charge.  This didn&#x27;t cause me a single problem, but I&#x27;d hate to be in the middle of cutting my third head of hair with it fully charged!  So if you&#x27;ve got a bunch of kids&#x27; hair to cut, make sure it&#x27;s been plugged in long enough to prevent some new form of mohawk.</li>
    <li> I still agree with my original review (below), but here&#x27;s an update. I bought this product 1 year and 5 months ago. After the latest charge it failed in remain on for no more than 2 seconds. I consider it dead. I know it was only $35, but I expected more than a year and a half out of it, especially when it was only used every 6-8 weeks. I have other razors and trimmers that I use much mroe often that have lasted longer. I have owner a couple otehr Remington products and bought this one because I have always been pleased with their products. I don&#x27;t know if I got a lemon or if this model in general sucks. I will not buy another one. I will go looking for a professional hair trimmer - a model used by hair stylists and not one marketed towards consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************************&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of spending $25 for a haircut every 6-8 weeks for a really simple hair style. I went looking for hair clippers and came across this innovative product. I have used it for two haircuts so far and it has now more than paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cautions, though. The battery doesn&#x27;t seem to hold its charge long, so make sure to charge it the night before using it. Cutting one&#x27;s hair is not as quick and easy as the ads lead me to believe. I have to go over my head very thoroughly over and over and even then there are still a bunch of hairs here and there that get missed and have to be clipped with scissors. Takes me about half an hour to cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the different length settings are accurate and I can trim down to just the length I want every time. The product is comfortable&lt;br /&gt;to hold and really easy to control. I am happy with this product and recommend it to any guy with a short haircut who wants to fire his barber or hairstylist. I can now cut my hair my way on my schedule for free.</li>
    <li> I had always wondered about cutting my own hair ever since it became thinner and thinner but worried that it would look unprofessional. I decided to try the Remington Short Cut and have used it twice so far. The first cut was a learning experience as it takes time to figure out how to hold it and at what angles. Also navigating around the ears is tricky. My wife and daughter thought the first cut( which I did longer than the second) was not that good, but both said my second one looked much better. I think the clipper works best when using the setting at 1.5 or less.</li>
    <li> This item lasted about a year, before the pathetic battery pack would not hold a charge. Like everyone else, the first indication was the charging light failed to come on. Then it would run sporaticly. And then no power at all.&lt;br /&gt;Was great at first, but then it went down hill quickly.</li>
    <li> Clipper works great. However my hair exceptionally fine. It makes it hard to reach the cutter with it.</li>
    <li> BEST BUY IN YEARS...THE BEST SHORT CUT CLIPPER...LOVE IT....</li>
    <li> I have short balding hair, but needs a good shavedown every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Was excited to see demo and ease of use online, but its anything but easy and effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sides of head very difficult (impossible) to cut&lt;br /&gt;**I removed even the clipper plastic thingy to expose only the razor to get close shave, doesnt shave evenly&lt;br /&gt;** Not even marginably better than other products I bought without the curve&lt;br /&gt;**the pop-up sideburn trimmmer is a joke and not sharp at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, another waste of TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just tried for 2nd use, it doesnt even work AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;returning for refund. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Love it while it works. Falls apart in weeks. I&#x27;ve own two hoping the first was a fluke.</li>
    <li> Stopped working just after the one use like many other reviews say. Very poor quality item. The head is very hard and scratches head. Won&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I share the same idea as most of other reviewers. This machine is great until it stops working. However, the lifetime seems to get each time shorter. From one year it has been reduced to one week! After purchasing 3 over the past 3 months, I surrender and get another brand. A pity!</li>
    <li> (EDITED 23/12/2012)&lt;br /&gt;I have this clipper for a couple of years and it has worked great. As time went by I notice I have to put oil more frequently so the razors keep working as they have (if not I can tell by sound that razors are running slower than they can).&lt;br /&gt;An explanation, based on other reviews, is that battery is not working as it had before. I should say I have not used it that regularly, so it could be great if Remington offer a better product version of this item that could work directly on AC power instead of depends only on the battery, which have its lifecycle... Nevertheless, a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I had this razor for just over a year.  I had taken to shaving my scalp with an Atra razor but that needed major upkeep.  So I decided to do maintenance with this electric clipper.  It worked pretty well.  Obviously, the shave was not as close but it kept things looking neat.  The clipper was easy to handle and was able to cover all areas pretty well.  It left a very short fuzz behind on the closest setting.  The only problem was that it stopped working after 1 year.  Despite regular charging it would not start up again.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers from a local retailer for my husband.  We charged it for the prescribed time right out of the box and the clippers didnt even last one hair cut.  We plugged it in to charge and the LED light isnt even glowing.  Unfortunately, he will end up taking a razor to his head to fix his hair since we got about a 3rd of the way through a hair cut before the clippers decided to quit on us... complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This unit worked fine for very short haircuts which is what I liked about about it at first. After about 6 months the battery started to drain rapidly. Sadly you can&#x27;t plug in the charging cord and continue cutting as my beard trimmer does. The battery will now only hold a charge for about one minute then wait 16 hours for another minute of use! I liked this unit at first but now it&#x27;s just something else to throw away! $30 is a lot of money to me and if it&#x27;s a lot to you don&#x27;t waste it on this product.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use love the different height levels...Great price</li>
    <li> This clipper has been great. I have had one for a year and a half. In fact I am buying a second one because It suddenly wont charge after 18 months. (And I think it is because it took too many clunks from being thrown into the drawer after use. But up to that time it has worked flawlessly with one caveat. I was reluctant to purchase initially because of the people that said it lasted only a few weeks. What I discovered is that if it seems sluggish when I turn it on, I put a drop of oil on the blades and MAGICALLY It comes ALIVE just as if it was brand new ! For those that say the battery doesn&#x27;t last, try a drop of oil on the blades and you will be shocked how well it works again with just a little lubrication. But give me a break ! for $40 dollars, its the best clipper I have ever used. It lasted much longer than I ever expected.</li>
    <li> works well on my beard!</li>
    <li> Skip this it pulls hair</li>
    <li> Junk, worked a couple of time but kept stopping tan just quit completely</li>
    <li> For short fades this is the way to go very easy to use.  Edge ups are easy and fading is a breeze.  This item pays for its self after 2 uses, no more $15-$20 every 7-8 days at the barbershop.     Negatives are there is no way to tell when its fully charged because the light is always blue, and the guard sizes are a little off a 1 is really a 0 and so on.  You would think having the guard on would be a 1 but let me tell you its a 0, trust me.</li>
    <li> Because of the way I use this, it&#x27;s perfect for me. I keep mine cut very short so I don&#x27;t use any of the adapters, instead, if needed I cut it back as much as I can with scissors, then finish it off with this using only the bare blade without any adapters. this buzzes it down to a very close crew cut, like a short beard. and the contour shape of the long blades is perfect for this. however I think it would be challenging to get a decent medium trim with this trying to use the cut adapters. your hair type would have to be just right for it. but to just buzz it down very tight is really easy with this when you get the hang of it. doesn&#x27;t take long, and the unit lasts for years. I&#x27;m going to get another one soon just to have it. I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever but for the price, I&#x27;ve had mine over 3 years easily. I thnk it&#x27;s slowing down a little as the battery nears the end of it&#x27;s service life, but it still works fine. very durable and you can rinse it briefly, but don&#x27;t submerge it I guess they say.  it&#x27;s well worth trying, glad I did.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these clippers about 3 years ago and have used it every weekend since then.  It is finally slowly not wanting to take a charge but that is ok as it didn&#x27;t just up and stop   in the middle of a cut so pretty pleased about that.  Anyway, I am buying another today.  3 years service for $29.00 to me is not great but the clipper is so easy to use it&#x27;s worth it.  I don&#x27;t   want to mess around with other styles as this one is made to cut with the curve of your head be it top or sides and makes an even cut perfectly simple and fast.</li>
    <li> Several cutting options for shorter or longer hair. Trimmer for side-burns. Easy to charge, and it maintains a charge for a good period of time. Easy to clean out the hair. Easy to hold to trim your own hair, or have another person do it.</li>
    <li> This product works very well as a balding clipper.  It cuts about as close as you can get without shaving. And, it does so very quickly and without having to see what you are doing.  I have only used the balding comb.</li>
    <li> The curved surface is a great idea, but there&#x27;s no flex. So if portions of your head are shaped in a way that differs from the curvature of the cutting surface, then you&#x27;re not going to get an even cut. Imagine shaving your face with a non-flexible razor blade that&#x27;s curved to fit your chin and jaw line, then using it on something relatively flatter, like cheeks or neck. You&#x27;d get a close shave at the edges of the blade, but not in the middle.</li>
    <li> this is one of the most stupid product I ever have seen from Remington . It doesn&#x27;t keep charge for 2 minute . after 3 month use this is piece of junk . My suggestion is  don&#x27;t buy it at all , otherwise if you throw your money do it</li>
    <li> I love it... took all the hair off evenly and I shaved in all different directions... you can&#x27;t go wrong!  It also saved all the hair off my body easily with very few scratches and down to the skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so ladies should buy one in pink..it works on the whole body!</li>
    <li> I think there is a problem with the on/off switch.  I have had the product less than a month and it stops and starts when it wants. I used it the first time and had trouble starting and stopping but I got my haircut finished.  Now the second use is not long enough to finish my cut and that&#x27;s a problem.</li>
    <li> This product is not very good for people who dont have full mobility of use of thier hands..  my nephew actually cut his head on the blade.  It goes to close to your scalp or higher is to high and doesnt cut right.  My personal opinion would I would. Not recommend this to anyone I know.  Sorr not safe enough.!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had this when I was on active duty.No Soldier should be without one,Great product for all who wear theyre hair short.</li>
    <li> So this is my second Shortcut Clipper that I bought.  The first one seemed to last about 5 months, and then I noticed a drop in the battery life.  I still like this unit very much, and think it cuts hair great.  It is just the Battery... Battery....  Battery..  Ok.  So I called the 1-800-736-4648 number in the owners manual and called to ask them about the battery life problems.  The women on the phone said that I need to plug it in and let charge for 16 hours before use...!!!!!  16 hours..!!!!  I can charge an electric car for a shorter amount of time than this.  Well, I will go ahead and try charging it for 16 hours.  I hope this helps you guys out.</li>
    <li> If you really like someone, and are in the market for some clippers. The Remingtons are the only way to go. The curved design makes short work of the task at hand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to be to wordy so all I have to say is it worked as advertised and was very safe and easy to use. Just comb your hair and it does all the cutting. So I used it for the first time and I really liked the way it cut the back of my head which is always dificult but this tool made it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for cutting your own hair to save time and money. This is my second one after the battary gone dead of my first one.</li>
    <li> This clipper does not cut that evenly, and because it is contoured/curved to the shape of your head, it&#x27;s almost impossible to cut the flat sides of your head. frustrating. And I&#x27;m not even sure how anyone could do any blending with this machine. Awesome idea, bad results.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, very easy to control and use. Follow the directions and you will have no problems. Only had it a short time and only used it a couple of times, but I like it. I only gave it four stars instead of five because the battery is ni-cad and not lion. Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> The battery never held a charge well - barely adequate for one long haircut - and the trimmer always seemed underpowered, but it did the job adequately for over a year. Then yesterday the battery went from fully charged (I had unplugged it moments before) to completely dead about 90 seconds into my haircut. I charged it overnight, and when I tried this morning to repair the damage it lasted less than 10 seconds. After reading other reviews by other owners with similar problems I scrapped my plans to overnight another and opted for a more reliable model from another manufacturer. Wearing out is acceptable but catastrophic failure with half a trim is not!</li>
    <li> Works better than I had hoped. Recommended by my brother in law who also has one. Very easy and efficient to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent device for keeping short cut hair well groomed.</li>
    <li> cuts fine and even, a bit annoying that it can&#x27;t be used while on the charger. battery life could be problem if your cutting your hair down from being a couple inches long</li>
    <li> First, it came in very late. The delays were not justifiable and in stark contrast with all other purchases I have made from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous reviews had mentioned that it is good only for very short hair, maybe a trim ... and my hair is almost gone, but this would only work at number 1. Even with the little hair left on my hear, it will hardly operate at numbers 2 and up. Also, the charge will be over very soon. The only way I can use it is too cut my hair at the desired number with another Clipper and then trim it with this one. Otherwise, it will very soon run out of battery. It would not have been so bad if you could use it while it is charging, but you cannot do that. For some reason, the clipper will not operate if it is plugged in.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to do my 4 year old sons hair. Most clippers he is afraid of but he likes these because it is just like brushing his hair. So easy and safe to use. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m saving money on haircuts because this works so well. I&#x27;m balding and I don&#x27;t need to go to the barber anymore.</li>
    <li> Looking for clippers for someone who keeps an almost clean cut hair cut due to head-center baldness (hubby) I came across this one, so far it is working very well, you set it all the way down and get a perfectly clean cut, adjust it to a higher setting to leave a little more hair on you, etc. etc.... easy to clean, hubby is satisfied which is so important for his appearance, he uses it at least once a week, he has managed to do it all by himself and fast which is very convenient, as well as saving money.</li>
    <li> I have been using regular clippers for years without getting the cut I wanted without a lot of frustration and time to get the job done correctly the first time.  Then, using the Remington Short Cut Clipper for the first time In ten minutes I had a perfect cut to the cut I wanted.  A great tool.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original I bought from Remington a few years back that seems they have discontinued.  It had a vaccume so no sweeping or mess.  This one you have to get ready to clean up after and shower or wear a cape.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Good protection of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The product is amazing. I liked it! That is all that i need.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t exist in Montreal.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these five years ago. Used it &#x27;till it wore out. Bought a model from Phillips which lasted less than a year. Glad to have another one of these back on my bathroom counter. Faster than sitting in a barber chair for 20-minutes. Use it twice and it pays for itself.</li>
    <li> It clogs up, does not hold the charge at times, I would not buy another</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair with the traditional type cutter for years.  It takes time and practice to get that ultra short uniform look that way.  This is much easier and faster.</li>
    <li> It was god for cutting, but I was not able to shape my hair with it. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Best hair cutter on the market in my opinion. The curved blade always gives an even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to cut their own (or someone else&#x27;s) hair</li>
    <li> A great idea that came to greatly ease the lives of those who prefer very short hair. It was a great buy.</li>
    <li> I have two thoughts on this item after purchase and use: [1] I did read the product description in any detail and thus I was disappointed that it was not a corded clipper.  I am not fond of chargers after living with a cell-phone for awhile.  [2] This product comes with two combs, a &amp;#34;balding Combe&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;regular comb.&amp;#34;  I use the latter and the big problem that I have with it, is that it clogs up with hair clippings of less than 1/8 inch.  I had to keep using an old toothbrush to clear it several times.  I am also concerned that oiling it from time-to-time presents somewhat of a problem because it isn&#x27;t easy to remove other parts to get to the area that wants the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I found that the price more than pays for itself when one considers that in a large city like I live in, haircuts are expensive (inclusive of tips) at about $20.00.  So, I am saving some money.  But had I to do it all over again, I would have purchased a corded electric clipper with various size heads like the barbers have in their shops.</li>
    <li> Charge won&#x27;t last long. Didn&#x27;t even use for a year till the charge was not lasting like it should.... Would stop in mid-haircut.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s time to embrace your baldness, this is an easy way to do it.  It&#x27;s easier than shaving and mine has held up for two years now...a savings of $480 over monthly trips to XxxxxXxxx. Now I have more money for beer! Just remember to lube the thing every moth or so. I bought a second one thinking the original was dying, but not so. After I oiled it, it was good as new. No issues with battery life. I use the thing once a week and it&#x27;s still going strong. Just say no to comb-overs and get yourself one of these.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use. Figure out the length setting ( you will set it too low at first), then rub it on your head. It is easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> Works really well, but eventually battery will fail. Used one of these for years every two weeks or so, but eventually the battery stopped holding a charge very well, bought another and have been using it for close to a year.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but find the rechargeable battery wanting.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for very long.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my two boys.  One came out with gaps in his hair from pushing too hard in some places.  The other had random long pieces sticking out.  Both said it took ages to do.  To be fair though, their hair was longish to begin with.  It may be good for touch ups.  The &amp;#34;edger&amp;#34; (for lack of a better name) was pointless, just like the other reviews said.  I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the money.  We&#x27;ll see how it does on the weekly or biweekly touch ups.</li>
    <li> This clipper works perfectly for me, and the blades and motor seem fine too, but the rechargeable battery wears out after about a year. I know how to cycle batteries like this and have had good success with most, but this clipper just fails to hold a charge after a year or so. Still, I save so much money and time by staying away from the barbershop that its well worth it so I just buy a new one each year or so. I&#x27;ve had three now and getting ready to put a fourth one into service. If the battery was better I&#x27;d give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: I guess I should mention the obvious here that the device will not operate on AC power alone. When the charging cord is connected, the motor is disabled. If this clipper would run on AC, it would be great!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it makes it really easy to shave my head. However, the battery is poor quality. I bought one less than a year ago and had to replace it. Also, the shaver cannot be used while plugged in, so if the battery goes dead, you are out of luck. The first one I had died while I was halfway through shaving.</li>
    <li> keep it oiled and it&#x27;ll work great . i&#x27;ve used it for 2 years, and there were times it seemed dead like a lot of reviews stated but all it needed was oil and it was fine.</li>
    <li> The blades are not precise do they do not cut, at least, my hair.  The plastic guide is very delicate, falls off and breaks at the slightest touch.  This product needs to be recalled and done away with, it was completely useless for me.</li>
    <li> I wore out my first one. This really works well</li>
    <li> Just stopped working. Bought at the end of September, used a few times. Battery went from doing a full shave, to having to recharge for a couple hours to finish a cut, to not even starting at all. I&#x27;ve only had it a few months and it simply doesn&#x27;t even start up.</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I owned. The first one I bought in 2009 at best buy. It lasted until the end of 2012. The battery just would not hold a charge anymore. I ordered this one from Amazon and the clipper is still great. It cuts evenly and contours to my head. I like to keep my hair short. I have noticed that this clipper has a better battery so far. I have cut my hair about 7 times so far and it has yet to lose charge and stop working. The clipper comes with an attachment that shaves to the skin, a regular attachment, cleaning comb, small bottle of oil, charger and manual. Make sure you remove the attachment that shaves to the skin prior to first use and install the regular attachment. Cleaning the clipper is fast and easy. If you like to keep your hair short this is a great clipper. However, if you have medium to long thick hair this won&#x27;t work well. So far the battery is holding up better on this clipper than my previous one.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good trimmer, this is my 2nd unit of this brand and style.  My original one lasted about a year with use at least 3 days per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is just about enough to do my entire head and face, but it does tend to start slowing down right about the time that I get done.  Although I might take longer to cut my hair than most people as I am paranoid I&#x27;ll miss a spot so I go back over my head 2-3 times to be sure I get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved design is great for keeping my hair close trimmed and works well on my facial hair too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did -1 star for the fact it \\&quot;only\\&quot; lasted a year, and the fact the battery seems to last for just one use before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly this product is the best angled trimmer I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my thoughts,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MG</li>
    <li> Very easy to use--a no-brainer.  Provides an even, smooth trim.  Cordless feature enhances ease of use.  Clean-up under running water is a very desirable feature.</li>
    <li> This thing is LOUD, and since it is on the flimsy side, it takes twice as long as a normal trimmer to get the job done, so plug up those ears or risk temporary deafness.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, and save as ton on no more haircuts.</li>
    <li> Great for body hear, not so much for a regular haurcut</li>
    <li> Great concept and when it worked, it worked great! HOWEVER, the battery is terrible and only lasted 3 haircuts for me before it stopped holding a charge. I gave it an extra star for the concept and ease of use, but in reality either save your money or invest in a better model.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use...great for a quick trim.  This is the second &amp;#34;Short Cut&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve owned...the rechargeable battery is lousy, but worth the price.</li>
    <li> The only good thing is the comb like action. Unfortunately, the battery is no good. The unit is unreliable. I charge it overnight then in the morning the blade is barely able to cut hair. Blade stops sometimes. I keep cleaning the blade but does not matter. The internal motor or battery is under rated. You get what you pay for. Save money and don&#x27;t buy this unit.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these, the only drawback I had is cleaning it between uses. I broke the first one after months of use banging it counter to get the little hair clippings out. The ideal thing would be to have a way to clean it with forced air.</li>
    <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ve had 2 of these and although it&#x27;s easy to use the life of the battery is pathetic. After 6 months it won&#x27;t even charge enough to use</li>
    <li> I have pretty thin hair and prefer a buzz cut. I&#x27;ll save a lot of money with this as it pays for itself quickly, but the real reason I got it is to keep my cowlick trimmed. It is impossible for me to grow long hair because of my oputrageous cowlick and now I can keep it trimmed closely. Thanks Remington!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR PEOPLE THAT CUT THEIR OWN HAIR.</li>
    <li> This is my second one (dropped the first from the top of the shower door ledge and it broke) and it is the best ever.  The battery life is great and it is very easy to use.  I use mine in the shower so I don&#x27;t get hair everywhere.  I use the shortest setting and it gets pretty close to bald as I don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; my head.  When I&#x27;m done I simply finish with a shower and the short hair goes down the drain.  no clean up necessary :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this to trim my chest hair occasionally and it works great for that too.</li>
    <li> I replaced a Remington vacuum clipper with this.  So, I do miss the mess-free feature that the Remington afforded, but I could  not find another one like it.  That said, this gets the job done with a little help from my wife.  The cordless feature allows us to cut my hair outside to avoid the hairy mess in the house. The depth is easily adjusted and the unit is easy to clean.  Get one to save big money on short haircuts.</li>
    <li> I would give this product four stars for the great job it did (note the use of past tense) on my head and beard, but it deserves just 2.5 stars for  poor durability/design and below-standard ability to hold a charge between uses. I bought it in 2012 and for more than two years it did a great job, despite its inability to hold a charge. It&#x27;s now on its last legs: the motor powering the shears is too slow to give a good cut and it has to be recharged after one or two minutes of use. Add to these negatives the facts that its plastic body (particularly the removable/adjustable shear guard) is very delicate and its less-than-ergonomic design make it uncomfortable to hold while in use. Now that it&#x27;s almost useless, I discovered that I get a BETTER trim (head hair and beard) if I use the various shear-guard attachments on my wonderfully serviceable Wahl PEANUT plug-in clipper. I fine-tune the beard details with my reliable (10-plus years of service and counting) Remington PG-250 trimmer. In short, I won&#x27;t be buying another SCC-100 to replace this dying swan.</li>
    <li> Only used it twice but it seems to be very good!</li>
    <li> Good design and woks as it was promised. battery last long after the first charge. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> did not last long at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair now for almost 15 years. Using a traditional pair of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get these because of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well. It takes a little time to get used to the fact that it can cut in both directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give five stars is because of the size adjust wheel.  On the first use&lt;br /&gt;somehow it moved during my haircut and I got a very short cut that time. Now, it could have&lt;br /&gt;been my error. It has not happened since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a pro at cutting your own hair or just getting started then I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Does the job...easy to use....a must for the clean dome look.</li>
    <li> I agree about the battery or charger system being the \\&quot;Pits\\&quot;. I have  been using one for about three years and the darn thing seems to never be charged, Now it is as dead as a door nail but am going to replace it as it is still the best deal in town for a tightwad like me. Haven&#x27;t had to pay a barber in a long time. Trouble with that is, my supply of jokes is getting thinner than my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big \\&quot;Con\\&quot; is that it is lousy at getting around the ears. Have to hit that area after with scissors.</li>
    <li> This device is a genius design. It really works nice. But unfortunately it has a little feel of cheap material to it. I wish they spent some more effort to make it a quality product. I would pay a lot more for this device only if it was made with better quality. Overall, it is not quality made and feels a bit flimsy in the hand. It cuts hair really short, more good for buzz cuts. The longest comb that comes with it, at its longest setting, cuts like a #3 at the barber shop. The rest are even shorter. But overall it does a good job and it is super easy to use. It pays for itself in 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Now the problems that need improvement are: The on/off switch is in an awkward place and easy to turn off in the middle of your work. It is located where you have to hold the handle, which makes it easy to accidentally turn on or off. They either have to move the switch to a different location or put a lock on the switch to prevent accidental activation. The exchange of the combs is a bit hard. The fit is not perfect and feels like cheaply made stuff that barely fit its parts. Cleaning the device is a bit of hassle, especially since you have to remove the comb, which is hard to put back in due to poor fit. I use compressed air (air in a can) to blow it and that makes it easier. The other surprising and silly thing is that it does not work when connected to electricity. So if you run out of battery in the middle of your haircut, you are going to be stuck with a bad hair day, because the darn thing takes almost 24 hours to recharge. :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine trimmer/clipper, perfect for guys who want to crop their hair close or -- like me -- who are balding.  A nice even cut all over.  When first purchased, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the battery as some others have had; everything worked well and the curved shape of the clipper is the killer feature that you don&#x27;t see anywhere else. Very highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a couple of months of intermittent use, I have to say that the battery is definitely the weak link. The charge will only last for a couple of minutes, which is fine for a trim, but little else.  It&#x27;s so bad that Remington should consider a recall or battery replacement.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair cutter: easy to use and gave me the cut I wanted. However, after only three uses, the battery will not charge. Dead, totally dead. Three haircuts: $10 each. I cannot afford to buy a new one every few weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes of a quick and easy short hair cut...First: Clogs with hair on each stroke making it totally useless until u clean the blade guard out. Second: Got really hot and smelled of smoke. I have short hair already so I cant believe I was overworking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT recommend this item at all</li>
    <li> I am really surprised Remington offers such a poor product.  I bought one, it pretty much died the second time I used it.  Figured it was bad luck, and for that price I&#x27;d try another.  It died on the 5th or 6th use.  Too bad because I do like the shape, and rechargability.  But even before they died, the blades ran slow.  I will look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I think people expect too much from tools.  If you buy a wood chisel it doesn&#x27;t make you a professional wood carver.  This does not make you a professional barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s a tool you have to learn to use it. If you expect to just open the box and giver yourself a perfect haircut you should not buy it or return it immediately.  Just like any tool it takes time to learn to use it properly.  This is especially true since your hair and hair style is not the same as mine.  When I had a lot of hair it took several visits for a new barber to learn what I liked so expect to spend some time in trail and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said I&#x27;m balding on the crown and I like to keep my hair short.  If you have long or shaggy hair this probably won&#x27;t work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I didn&#x27;t have much luck the first time. My hair was about an 1-1.5 inches long and I did not do well trying to trim it down even a bit at a time with this.  My suggestion would be to use regular clippers to get your hair close in length the first time then use these to finish the job and maintain your haircut.  Once you get it right and learn to use it this clipper is 2 minutes of work a week to keep your haircut well maintained all the time. You might even want to get a fresh barber cut then try to maintain it after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts for 3-4 cuts for me and that includes trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will state that you might want to use a beard trimmer for the detail work like sideburns, around the ears and the neckline etc.  Take your time too; it&#x27;s harder to do but you can gouge and get an uneven cut.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these clippers. We gave it as a gift to a friend for the holidays. Very is to use and take care of.</li>
    <li> The item is great!! In few minutes I could give myself a decent hair cut. After almost 8 months the battery failed to charge, and last only a couple of minutes which were not enough.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;m 89 and te hair is knd of skimpy. Although it does look better when I&#x27;ve  just been to tha barber, Im  doing my best to simplify my life.  I was in the 8thyear of &amp;#34;Caring&amp;#34; for my wife who had Alzhimer&#x27;s , and I had to be with her all the time so eliminaingthe barber was an easy choice and the Remington  &amp;#34;Short Cut&amp;#34; wasan easy  decision.  I had confidence in the ame, and Amazon&#x27;s price made iteasier.  I have been using it for 8 months. Its a snap to use and charg.  I use the 3/8 setting. The ladies at church say it makes me look younger; which is good for my ego.  The only unexpected planning involved is selecting the location to use it.  Happily for its cordless opration I ca go outside without any shirt or other top and use it.  That way I can put a towel on my shoulders to catch the hairs, and whishk the away away with that towel.  Early on I mistakenly did a cut with a T sirt on. The prickly hairs that it cought  ... even with vigarous shaking were a discomfor for the rest of the day.  Charging is painless. It shuts the charge off automatically, so just go away and leave it on the counter .  Read the instructions on how to lift the combing attchment of for cesning. I was apprehensive I might break it untill  I cought n\on. I&#x27;m a happu vamper for the productand for Amazon&#x27;s  service.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I wore my first one out, used it for about 4 years. I had to have another one. Its fast and it works. Use it twice and its paid for compared to what a hair cut costs. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got one of these hair cutting tools a while ago. I remember it taking forever to charge up, but it worked well once it was full powered. I would leave it charging overnight and get about one session of cutting out of it. After 10 minutes of usage the battery/ motor would start to power down. Perhaps I had a defective device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this item did work, the hair cutting levels feature was great for adjusting it just right to the hair length you want. The shape of the blade fit the contours of my head nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully there will be an upgrade to the rechargeable hair cut kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my personal use, and I noticed that it is made in china, so I began to worry about its quality, I&#x27;m afraid it will be broken soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this day comes. Today it&#x27;s my 4th time to use it, and its power button can&#x27;t work now, the machine just keeps on and can&#x27;t be switched off until it runs out of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This haircut is not cheap, but its quality is so poor, not worth the money at all. This is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone want to buy this product, SAVE YOUR MONEY !</li>
    <li> I like mine, no complaints.  It does take awhile to charge, but I still get a full haircut with time to spare and I have had it for over a year.  My only question is, can I sharpen it or do I need to buy a new one.  I certainly got my money&#x27;s worth out of this one.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one about 5-8 years ago.  It died.  This one is almost exactly like the first one but it seems to do the &#x27;charge&#x27; better.  The woman at Remington said &amp;#34;They changed the battery&amp;#34;.  Goody.</li>
    <li> I have quite short hair, I generally us the 1/8&amp;#34; clipper attachments. This clipper really did not work for me, it left lines of different lengths and was pretty much a disaster. Might work better for a fuller head of hair.</li>
    <li> Cuts good but sounds like it always need a recharge.</li>
    <li> If you shave your head, after you use this I don&#x27;t know how you could go back to a level clipper</li>
    <li> I will start by warning people, do not buy this item, the battery died on me, refusing a charge after only four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the battery had worked, I would give this five stars.  I buzz my hair.  This clipper cut my hair cleanly and quickly.  It is cordless and easy.  It is a fantastic clipper except for the fact that it does not work after about the sixth use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were other warnings about the battery, and I wish I had followed their advice.</li>
    <li> I have used this item and I rather enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use and got kind of a kick out of it, you know, fun.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research and I am so happy to have found this trimmer.  It comes with 2 attachments.  The balding attachment goes to 0.6mm.  I however take off the attachments and put the metal directly on my scalp and it gets much closer.  It gets just as close at the trimmer attachment on my Norelco electric shaver.  Sometimes its tricky to get close around the ear area and I end up cleaning it up with my trimmer from my electric shaver which takes only a few seconds.  I use this about once every 3 days to keep my head nearly bald without having to go thru the trouble of shaving.  Plus I like the stubble look better than the shaved look.  If you want a trimmer to get nearly bald that is very quick and easy to use you need to get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have changed to shaving my head.  I still use this to trim body hair, arms and legs.  This is a great tool, very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years now, and I&#x27;ve used it weekly.  It does a great job.  I&#x27;ve been away from home for a few weeks and did not bring this clipper and so I have had to use a traditional clipper with the small straight edge.  I hate it! I&#x27;ve been spoiled with this wireless, CURVED clipper.  With this clipper, it have fewer &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; spots, and I never cut my head or ears.&lt;br /&gt;I have to charge it about every 4 cuts, and oil it at the same time.  Great product, recommended it to anyone who shaves their head regularly.</li>
    <li> This was easy to use, great haircuts. I would recommend. The battery works really well as well even though other people have complained in prior reviews.</li>
    <li> This clipper is the best hair clipper my husband has ever used. I recommend it to everyone who likes short cuts.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my chest, back, arms legs and privates.  You can go from adjustable lengths, (privates, arms and legs) to bare skin on your back!!!  It is rechargeable, cuts in both directions and very little need for 2nd or 3 rd passes.  I have used clippers, 360 man groomers and even epillady and this one is the fastest and most efficient trimmer out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used it on my head, but I guess it would work.  I have owned it for over a year now and use a little mineral oil on the blades once a month and still running strong!!!</li>
    <li> I use these clippers in between my regular haircuts, for quick touch ups. Easy to use and rechargeable...so no cords to fuss with while you are using them. I only wish they had a few more hair length settings. Then it would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is my second short cut clipper and is a great product, much easier to use than the normal straight edge clipper</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this clipper for about a month and have only used it twice.  Prior to using this, I used standard Conair clippers for several years.  The problem I had with the standard clippers was that it took me a long time to even up the back of my head.  I thought the this Remington would cut down the time needed to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found with this Remington Clipper was that if you wanted a very close buzz cut, it works well for that.  But if you want any length at all other than near balding, you will be disappointed.  Using the variable attachment, regardless of setting, I find it difficult to produce an even cut.  Even with the close cut, I still had to go over head a hundred or so times before I was satisfied, so the whole process is time-consuming for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the time and cutting difficulties, the Remington makes a mess.  It doesn&#x27;t just cut hair, it mulches it, so you have slivers of hair everywhere.  To remedy this, I use over the tub prior to showering.  This is a good way to contain the hair.  You also have to clean and lubricate the unit after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds like I&#x27;m ripping the Remington, however I&#x27;m OK with the purchase.  I&#x27;ve used it twice with a month in between uses, so it&#x27;s already paid for itself.  I like  the close buzz cut and spending the time on the cut and clean-up only once a month is not so bad.  In addition, I believe that I&#x27;ll get better at using it.  So some of the negative things that I mentioned, may not be so bad over time.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty remarkable product and it is a shame they can&#x27;t give it a more trustworthy power supply. I&#x27;ve been using mine for about 4 months now and can see the substantial power loss after just a few minutes of use. Luckily, getting a quick short hair trim doesn&#x27;t consume too much power, then it&#x27;s back on the charger. Really is nice to not have to go the barber any more though.</li>
    <li> At my age and with the minimal hair that I have, this is a great product for the price.  I use it every 1-2 weeks to trim back my hair and save $15 a pop by not going to the barber shop.  After 2-3 uses, it&#x27;s paid for itself and in the course of the year, I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third unit I&#x27;ve owned over the last couple of years.  While it is claimed to be waterproof, the first one I rinsed off after use and it shorted out after several months of use.  I know because I took it apart and could see the corrosion.  The second unit lasted about 2-3 years and I would brush it off after use.  The only drawback with the product aside from the faulty claim to be waterproof is that the rechargeable batteries are difficult to remove for disposable and are not replaceable.</li>
    <li> Instructions say to use clipper just like you were brushing your hair and that clipper cuts in either direction-tried cutting forward,backward, side to side- works the same in any direction which is very slowly. On the plus side does not pull or grab which is because it hardly cuts. Not a good buy unless you want to spend a lot of time cutting and recutting to get a so-so haircut.</li>
    <li> Please listen to the negative reviews!  I took a chance because the design is so good for buzzcuts.  It was great for three haircuts, but now it doesn&#x27;t even charge.  This thing is dead in the water.  Buy this only if you want to cut your hair once then use it as a paper weight.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these a few years ago while getting ready to head to Afghanistan.  My assignment was out in the middle of nowhere - I assumed that as bad as things might get, at least when I needed to cut my hair the short cut clipper would do the trick.  Well - to cut a long story short, after following all the instructions on charging and everything else, the thing just didn&#x27;t work - ever!  There was no way to ship it back from where I was so I just threw it in the trash and moved on.  I would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Makes keeping hair short so easy, and the curved design of the clippers makes it easier to get all areas of the head comfortably.</li>
    <li> highly recommended clippers... used it a lot..</li>
    <li> Cuts my hair evenly and short the way I like it.</li>
    <li> This is for people who sport a crew cut or trying to maintain one. Best use to keep your cut fresh on an extended trip. I would suggest a full day charge for a whole constant 15-20 min session, because that&#x27;s how long it remains strong and you don&#x27;t need more than that for a simple crew cut or maintenance. I wish I discovered this product sooner, best 40$ I&#x27;ve ever spent. I take it every foreign trip I go...gotta look good for the ladies :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a while now and if works well.</li>
    <li> Never need to pay a barber again!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much better than a standard trimmer.  I don&#x27;t know what head the shape fo the blades were molded after but apparently my head is much more round than the internal curve of these clippers. This means that really only the middle third of the clippers really hits the surface. I get MUCH better results using a standard WAHL beard trimmer on my head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of these so far. When they work, they work pretty well. But each time, after a year or so, it simply stops working and won&#x27;t charge. It&#x27;s not the charger. The other quirk is starts out slowly, then sort of &amp;#34;wakes up&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s annoying but not really a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you have to replace it every year, it still pays for itself in a few uses. But when you rely on it and need to trim your hair, and it&#x27;s decided to not work any more... not so fun.</li>
    <li> Nice even trim, easy to keep my hair even, I wear it short and cropped, so this is ideal and a big money saver.</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptical about ordering this, but once i received it and tried it out, i was pleasantly surprised.  It is really easy to use being cordless, It is small enough to throw in my suitcase when i go on vacation.  I love this, and use it once a week to keep my hair in check.  I don&#x27;t just use this on my head either.</li>
    <li> Easier to use than regular clippers, especially when clipping your own hair.  Just remember to use the correct attachment.  Holds charge well.</li>
    <li> Totally worthless if you want your hair to look nice.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a really sloppy cut.&lt;br /&gt;It would be hard to be less pleased</li>
    <li> It works but is delicate and breaks easily. Very comfortable and easy to use, does what it says it does, but it&#x27;s a cheaply made clipper that broke after a uses. All in all if uou can find something that is designed like this but built better, than I would go with that option.</li>
    <li> great if u want to shave your own head on the reg</li>
    <li> Works well, but.... It seems it doesn&#x27;t get around the ears very well, and the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  You have to get creative to do around your ears.  I&#x27;ve found that setting it to a 1 for the front of your head, sideburns and ears is good, then going to a 1.5 for the rest of your head to even it out.  Something you have to use small scissors to trim up around the ears if you miss a spot -- and hopefully you have a wife to help you, because behind the ears can be a chore and hard to reach!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the person who likes the take down all the body hair.  I use for my head, face, arms, chest and back.  I don&#x27;t use the sizes, just the straight blade.  Be careful with a new unit using the direct blade because it can leave marks on you because its very sharp.  other than that I&#x27;ve been using this unit for about 6 years and does great by me.  Holds a charge for the entire head/face shave and still has some life.  I replace after about a year and a half with 3x/week use because the non-replaceable batter last for shorter periods of time... that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this unit to any bald person or anyone who likes the take the hair off the body.  the long blade make a qick session and no other brand offers this feature.</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected</li>
    <li> Below is the review I left when I first received this product and charged for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I find after the third charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a load of rubbish. After the first charge it is not able to hold a charge at all all. After a twelve hour charge it held its charge for about five seconds (NO EXAGERATION) after a third charge, no change. I now class this as an expensive paperweight!!!! If I could raight this below a one star I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second one of these that I have bought. The first was bought here in Australia and the charger was for 240volt down to 4volt. I had it for about three and a half years before it packed up. It gave me the best result of any clipper I have purchased  yet. I could not buy another of these in Australia, and thought they were no longer made, that is, until finding them quite by accident on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this thinking my old charger would do the trick of charging the new clippers. Much to my surprise, the old charger was not needed as the new charger automatically switches between 110-240volt and converts down to 5.6volts, which just left the issue of the plug. It is supplied with a USA/Canadian type \\&quot;A\\&quot;, so all that was needed was a Australian/New Zealand type \\&quot;I\\&quot; plug converter for around $AUS20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer noted that these were for frequent light use. I agree, kind of. What I tend to do, is, with my more conventional type of trimmer take off most of hair to be cut, then, with the \\&quot;Short Cut Clipper\\&quot; just give my head a light going over, kind of like a finishing coat of paint you might say. This has given me a very professional look while at the same time, extending the life of the \\&quot;Short Cut Clipper\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, Very, Pleased</li>
    <li> I googled hair trimmer with vacuum and apparently didn&#x27;t read carefully enough.  I thought this one had a vacuum, afraid not.  I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. My Maine Coon cat thinks this is a neat brush. She walks back and forth in front of me. It&#x27;s not too noisy. I would have given 5 stars but it does trap the fur and needs to be cleaned often. Although this  is easy. It may just be because I&#x27;m using a hair trimmer on my cat. I had tried an animal trimmer and it also clogged and was not nearly as easy to clean. I read reviews on lots of hair clippers and another customer said they bought this for their cat but used it on themselves I recommend this for cats.</li>
    <li> I gave this a five because it does what it says. I dial the longest setting of 1/2 inch, and put it flat on the hair, and go back and forth. I cut my hair in about 5 minutes, and it&#x27;s a really good cut. I saw some stating it cut their hair incorrectly, but that is probably because the held it at an angle, which would then cut it shorter that what they dialed on the settings. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to wait for the barbers&#x27; or hairdressers&#x27; hair cut.</li>
    <li> Rating of ZERO STARS wasn&#x27;t an option but would be most accurate.  I purchased one of these so I could avoid dodgy 3rd world barber shops and still keep my hair trimmed while traveling/working abroad.  Good idea, good design, absolute crap construction with battery life insufficient for even one complete cutting.  I was surprised and disappointed that Remington would lend their name to this trash.  By the time I returned home I was unable to get it either refunded or exchanged.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> I do love this machine!!!  I never expect to be this easy to keep my hair low and nice clean.</li>
    <li> I have had this for nearly two years now, and I&#x27;m ready to give it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is great for very short buzz cuts, but it&#x27;s not necessarily the fastest, and I usually have to make multiple passes to trim everything. The shape is great and comfortable, and the design is good, except that I constantly hit the on/off button on accident while trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is more than adequate for a full trim. I often trim my facial hair and [ahem] other stuff after doing my head, and if I start while fully charged, I can always get everything done. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t give you much notice if the battery is low. The warning light comes on, and then it&#x27;s dead about 30 seconds later. You can&#x27;t trim while charging, and even charging overnight won&#x27;t get you a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaping tool dealie is a bit rough on soft skin, but it&#x27;s nice that it is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My trimmer has gotten sluggish. I usually have to turn it off and on a few times before I can get it going at full speed. I figured I would leave this review before shopping for something else. We had a good run, kiddo, but it&#x27;s time to say goodbye.</li>
    <li> Just comb your hair and your done cutting. And cleaning was as simple as rinsing under water. This would be perfect for military personal to keep that professional look.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and I have one.&lt;br /&gt;They work great and cuts easy. Best self service haircut! You may need a little help with the neckline but the top, sides and front look great!</li>
    <li> I love mine; no significant problems with the batteries as others have described. I use it without any of the guards to shave my head. Works great as a body groomer too b/c of all the surface area of the cutters.</li>
    <li> The Remington Short Cut Clipper is nothing more and nothing less. It&#x27;s not versatile, and it will not provide you with the tools to try out new styles. However, it&#x27;s not supposed to. It&#x27;ll cut your hair a consistent short length with relatively little effort. You could consider it one of those \\&quot;not necessary but nice to have when needed\\&quot; type tools. Is it something I&#x27;d find myself using on a regular basis? Absolutely not, but that&#x27;s just me. If you like your hair to stay consistently short, this might be just what you need.</li>
    <li> I received the Shortcut for Father&#x27;s Day and it is the greatest gadget gift I have ever received from my kids.  I clipped on the \\&quot;balding comb\\&quot; and went right to work.  Absolutely perfect down to the nub.  \\&quot;balding comb\\&quot; is slightly misleading--if you want to be bald, you&#x27;re going have to use a razor, but, you won&#x27;t have much to shave.  If there is one thing that might be improved, it is the cut that you get on the sides of your head.  The curved blades which make it so easy to cut most of your head actually work against you when you cut over the ears.  If you prefer really short hair like I do, then the Supercut is definitely for you</li>
    <li> This clipper is AWESOME! My wife&#x27;s been cutting my hair for 10 or more years now (with a Wahl clipper), so this allowed me to do it by myself. I use it at the shortest setting which is shorter than my regular clippers were ever able to go. It is so easy to use. Just remember the 2 most important things: 1) Hold it like a brush when you cut your hair, and 2) Go slowly! You will still be able to cut your hair in less than 10 minutes going slowly. It cuts very easily and evenly because it cuts in both directions. It also cleans-up easily. I just use a brush to remove the \\&quot;clippings\\&quot; after I remove the cutting guard. I now end up cutting my hair every week. I can&#x27;t express how much I really like this clipper! Finally, something that allows me to cut my own hair and does it very easily. If you like to keep your hair short, this is the perfect clipper for you.</li>
    <li> This is a clipper &amp; trimmer in one. The trimmer slides out from the top &amp; both are controlled by the power button. It has a 40 min use on rechargeable battery built-in so it&#x27;s cordless. It cannot run plugged in once it runs out (14-16 hours to charge). The settings are done by dial to pop up/down the plastic comb 1-4 for 1/8\\&quot; - 1/4\\&quot;. Supposedly you can also rinse the blades. The instructions say to use short strokes &amp; don&#x27;t move it too quick or you&#x27;ll feel a pulling sensation. If you rinse the unit, you must re-oil it w/the tiny bottle of oil they provided or just use the small brush they give.&lt;br /&gt;I had one family member try this on his very short hair though only in the back since the hair on top is slightly more then an inch &amp; he did not want to cut it that short as well. The result in the back fixed a bad job the barber did &amp; look perfectly uniform. We used the trimmer to clean the hairline in the back for a very polished job.&lt;br /&gt;For $30 he said he would buy this unit. Another family member had even longer hair of 2-3\\&quot; so he only used the trimmer on the back of his head for the hairline &amp; as a beard trimmer which he said worked well.&lt;br /&gt;It is designed well, especially the cordless feature since you would probably be slapped in the head if it was plugged in. I did hit the power button while using it once, it seems an overly large size of a button. The trimmer slides forward &amp; has a locking button as well.&lt;br /&gt;I think this was designed very well, I just wish it had even longer cutting lengths even just up to 2\\&quot; or even a full inch.</li>
    <li> Good clipper, works better and is more convenient than traditional clippers. For longer hair a pair of scissors is needed beforehand to trim everything down, basically works well only on and for short cuts. The sideburn trimmer is hand as well. If I had to come up with one fault its the curve head which is sometimes hard to use but other than that a very good product.</li>
    <li> The first thing that you should know about this clipper is that it&#x27;s called the \\&quot;Shortcut\\&quot; for a reason, the reason being that it only works if you want a buzz cut with your scalp showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing is that you should read the instructions before using it. It comes with the \\&quot;balding comb\\&quot; attached, so if you decide to charge it and start clipping, you&#x27;re going to end up with a buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It comes in an easy to open package that you won&#x27;t need a chainsaw to open&lt;br /&gt;2. It includes two combs, a cleaning brush, blade oil, a charging adapter and an instruction manual&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s compact and easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn&#x27;t come with a bunch of different sized cutter attachments, as it uses a 5 position zoom wheel to set the length of cut you need&lt;br /&gt;5. It has a pop out trimmer for around the ears and neck area&lt;br /&gt;6. It has a warning light to tell you when it should be recharged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It takes about 16 hours for a full charge&lt;br /&gt;2. As mentioned above, it comes with the balding comb already attached, and unless you read the instructions first (or this review) you won&#x27;t know that the adjustable hair length settings only work with the adjustable guide comb.  If you need to trim longer hair, you MUST change the comb first.&lt;br /&gt;3. It doesn&#x27;t work well with the adjustable guide comb.  It hardly looks as though it&#x27;s doing any cutting at all, but in a very short time you&#x27;ll find that the hair clogs up the comb, necessitating removing the comb and cleaning it out before continuing.  (The comb is curved inwards at the top, with horizontal bars, and these trap the hair, clogging the blades)&lt;br /&gt;4. It takes much too long to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;5. The pop out trimmer works, but is tough on tender skin.&lt;br /&gt;6. The location of the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button makes it much too easy for accidental starting while popping out the trimmer or changing the combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anything longer than a buzz cut or complete hair removal.  For longer hair that just needs a quick trim, there are better clippers available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For buzz cuts - 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;For longer cuts - 1 star&lt;br /&gt;Average - 2.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, August 7, 2008here are better clippers available.

    <li> Used it three times, absolutely no trouble-- although I have my wife check the back and sometimes finish up.  I could probably get by with a hand mirror.      I use the balding comb about once a month.      I have found the blades on conventional cheaper clippers go bad after a year or two.  I have a Remington Titanium shaver that has stayed sharp for about three years and I hope this will hold up as well.    A product I like a lot!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product and figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Then I used it and had bad results. It didn&#x27;t cut very evenly and it even cut me.</li>
    <li> I buy way too many \\&quot;gadgets\\&quot;.  Most of them sound like cool toys and usually end up at the bottom of a drawer or in the trash.  Of the gadgets I&#x27;ve bought that I can&#x27;t live without, regardless of the price I paid, are my GPS unit, phone headset, Tivo and a handful of others.  The first time I saw the Remington ShortCut hair trimmer I didn&#x27;t think twice about it and walked away.  It is a gadget that&#x27;s designed for a very limited and specialized target market ... those who like to have their hair cut very short and evenly across their entire head.  It&#x27;s also a gadget that has zero necessity, because there are all kinds of hair clippers on the market, and only a small percentage of people cut their own hair.  So I thought the idea was silly.  Then I started looking at my hair in the mirror and noticed that there are always some wayward strands that grow faster and make my haircut look less-than-fresh.  And, to get away with the close-cropped look, it really has to be trimmed every few days to keep it even and orderly.  That would get pretty spendy at a barber shop.  What I&#x27;ve been doing until I discovered the Remington ShortCut is to use regular electric barber clippers with one of those cheesy plastic guides that is supposed to cut your hair at an even length.  It is definitely not easy to use single-handedly and the length of my hair after clipping is always just a tiny bit too short.  With low expectations I tried the ShortCut.  My first impression is that it has a pretty good build quality.  It comes pre-installed with the balding comb.  CAUTION:  if you don&#x27;t want to look like an egg after your first trim, be sure to take the balding comb off and replace it with the adjustable comb!  The adjustable comb has 5 preset stops ranging from about ¼\\&quot; to about ½\\&quot;.  What Remington doesn&#x27;t say is that you can really set it to anywhere in between if you are careful not to press it too hard against your scalp (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway).  After charging the unit overnight I was anxious to try it and swiped it a few times casually over my head.  I was impressed.  With a few simple motions, the same as using a hairbrush, the job was done and my hair was very neatly trimmed, with no pesky strands of longer-than-usual hairs poking out.  A few minutes every few days is all it takes to have your hair perfectly trimmed 24/7.  In my judgment, that is what make a product a necessity rather than a gadget, and makes it worth whatever price you pay.  Except the price for the ShortCut is dirt cheap.  This is one of the most highly recommended items I&#x27;ve reviewed and earns a solid 5 stars.  For maybe 95% of people, they would have no need for the ShortCut, but for me and guys like the new U.S. president it is a total winner.ht I was anxious to try it and swiped it a few times casually over my head.

    <li> I had been interested in buying this product before I even new exactly what is was that I wanted to buy.  After some research online, I discovered the Remington Clipper.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and am very satisfied.  One more month without going to the barber and I will have recouped my expenses.  While the &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; reviews may come to pass, such as the battery, until then I consider it well worth $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip -  set the clipper to 1 (lowest/shortest setting) to cut the hair on your neck.</li>
    <li> This thing saved me a ton of money- I generally like the design. The flaws are a medium quality battery which apparently works for 6 months of use and then doesn&#x27;t charge enough (haven&#x27;t had this happen yet). I wish this thing would also work while plugged into the charger cable, so you could use it when the battery dies. Other than that, I have no complaints. I clipped my hair to a #4 length- I had longer hair to begin with. Ideally this is used for short hair to maintain it. It is not particularly powerful, so if your hair is grown out like mine was, it will take quite a few back and fourths to get rid of the hair- not to mention tapping out the clipper when it gets clogged up every 5 or so passes. However.... This is still a great deal, and already saved me money. you still need a mirror set to get the back line right on your head, and I brought in my girlfriend to touch up some spots on the back and by my ears. In any case, if this thing even lasts 4 hair cuts, I am way in the green. My hair cut came out as good as super cuts etc. and I can maintain it at this length now. 5 stars when they come out with plug-in-able version. You will need a full charge to get through a tougher hair cut. Very easy to adjust lengths, and comes with two guards (one is like a #.5-2.5, ad the other is up to a #4) The guards clip in and out easy, and this thing is light and feels like you are brushing your hair. Overall a good do for the short hair-types.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper 5 times. and all five times it has stopped working with in 3 uses. love what it does clips my head very well.&lt;br /&gt;but not worth the life of the product.</li>
    <li> I got tired of spending $20.00 for a 5 minute sitting for someone to cut what little hair I have left, not to mention the requisite chit-chat. If you want to keep your hair short, set the dial on about 1.5 and this will do the job. I also use it for my manchu/mustache with the dial on about 2.0 . The battery will recharge for 12-18 months, then quickly become useless....hence the reason for this being number 3. A monthly haircut @ $20.00 will cost you 240.00 annually. Even if you only get 12 months use from the Remington at a 30.00 - 40.00 purchase price, you&#x27;re way ahead economically. I wouldn&#x27;t try this on longer hair, but the curved design works well for the quick, do it yourself short hair-job.</li>
    <li> They do not supply 240 volts. the product is okay but not brilliant does the job and will last just over a year.</li>
    <li> i have had a similar product before and this one is just as easy to use. Would recomend to anyone</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS OUTSTANDING. I GIVES A BUZZ CUT WITH LITTLE EFFORT AND WITH GREAT UNIFORMITY. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> X &#x3D; whatever you&#x27;re lucky to get. I&#x27;ve owned 4 of these, and I&#x27;ve had them last anywhere from a year to 3 years before crapping out. When it works, it&#x27;s a fantastic product. I look at it like this, my barber charges $20 a cut. So I&#x27;m still saving when I replace these. I think they&#x27;re great clippers, they just need to fix the battery.</li>
    <li> This clipper is great. It works well and is very easy to use. As a matter of fact I used it this morning.</li>
    <li> This is truly awesome.  It&#x27;s so easy to use, and can be cleaned by running it under the faucet, which also keeps the hair wet.</li>
    <li> Clips just the way I need</li>
    <li> The product works great and for balding hair cuts, I use the device without the plastic guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read online before buying that product to remember to drain the battery after 1 or 2 hair cuts (i.e. keep it running until the battery dies)- only then should you recharge for a full 24 hours.  Then it is as good as new for 1 or 2 more hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER:  it is all strategy.  Cut your hair but remember to DRAIN the battery before performing a 24 hour re-charge.</li>
    <li> Let some one cut ur hair with thing or else.</li>
    <li> Let me start by addressing the elephant in the room, the battery. I was very hesitant to buy the Remington Short Cut because of the large number of negative reviews about the battery. I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy it anyway.  My experience with the battery so far has not been a negative one.  The first time I charged the Short Cut I left it plugged in overnight. When the unit is charged the blue light will go out. I get about two 10-12 minute trims on a single charge with about two weeks between trims, so I end up charging the Short Cut about once a month. I always charge it the day before I need to use it and never after the battery is run down after performing a cut. While I can&#x27;t speak about the longevity of the battery, I can say that I am happy that I don&#x27;t need to charge the Short Cut every time I use it. I think the longer you go between charges may extend the overall life of the battery as well.   Update:  I used my Short Cut this morning (7/5/15) and decided I would update my Amazon review. To my surprise I checked my purchase history and I purchased my Short Cut on 6/27/13 and it is still going strong, and I mean strong. I typically use it 2-3 time as month and charge it about every 2 weeks. I think the key to longer battery life is cleanliness. I thoroughly clean and oil the blades each use. At first I wasn&#x27;t oiling the blades after each use but I noticed an audible difference in the sound after oiling. It sounds smoother and less worked when oiled regularly. This thing has saved me well over $200 and I would definitely buy another one once the battery on the one I own now dies. Right now it is not showing any sign of it.  OK, on to the rest of my review. The very first time I cut my hair with the Short Cut I was very nervous. I have always had my hair cut by someone else my entire life so the thought of doing it myself was rather daunting the first time. However, the product&#x27;s box is correct: You can&#x27;t mess this up! You literally use the Short Cut like a comb and it does all the work for you. The whole process is pretty messy so you better have a towel wrapped around your neck. I quickly learned the best place to cut my hair is in the shower before taking a shower. When I&#x27;m done I clean the Short Cut and after taking a shower I don&#x27;t have the irritating feeling of hair on my neck and shoulders. The end result is a nice even short cut hair cut.  A few other things about the Short Cut. It comes with two guards, oil, and a cleaning brush. The first time I plugged it in to charge it the blue light came on and when I checked it the next morning (less than 10 hours later) the blue light was out. Initially I thought something was wrong but this is a normal indication.  The Short Cut comes with two guards. One guard is primarily for bald cuts while the other guard lets you choose an adjustable length cut be turning a wheel on the Short Cut which adjusts the guard up and down. A word of caution: When changing the guard or removing the guard to clean the Short Cut, adjust the guard up to the highest setting and gently remove the guard. The guards are keyed which make putting it back on a breeze. Again, use the highest setting when removing or changing the guard.  There are a few things I don&#x27;t like about the Short Cut. First, the Short Cut does not come with any kind of storage bag, but I did find that everything fits nicely into a gallon zip lock bag. The Short Cut has a built in pop out trimmer but it does not work very well. Honestly, it was a big let down the first time I tried to use it to trim my sideburns and around my ears. It just doesn&#x27;t really feel like it is cutting anything.  This is the main reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.  Overall, I would highly recommend the Short Cut for anyone who likes a short buzz cut. For years and years I paid on average $10-12 for a buzz cut about once a month. With the Short Cut I am able to maintain my short cut by using it about three times a month. I cannot tell the differencebetween a professional $10-12 cut and the Short Cut cut. The $29.99 I paid for the Short Cut has already paid for itself. The Short Cut literally feels like you are brushing your hair, it&#x27;s that easy. No matter what direction you are brushing, the Short Cut is cutting your hair. The more you use the Short Cut the more comfortable it feels cutting your own hair. If you like your hair short and  looking for a way to maintain a good looking hair cut and save money to boot, the Short Cut is worth a look.  You really can&#x27;t mess this up!</li>
    <li> Why would anyone go to the barber when this is so inexpensive. In two hair cuts, this pays for itself. Actually, its great for all over hair. The unit is curved to shape your head as well as &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; body parts. We have three at home and this was the cheapest one we have found so far.&lt;br /&gt;The charge last a very long time, it it easy to clean and does not pull hair out while shaving.  VERY happy with product and service.</li>
    <li> This little ditty is a huge time and money saver for me.  There is really no point in going to my barber anymore which saves me $20 a week.  I have a buzz cut (obviously) and i use the 1 setting for sides and back, and number 2 for the top.  It blends great and you will have a hard time screwing it up since it is contoured to the shape of your head.  Best clipper design on the market in my opinion.  I usually let my 10 yr old daughter cut my hair since she gets a kick out of it, and results are as good as if I just walked out of the barber shop.  I have to cut my hair about once a week to keep the length consistent, but since it literally takes me 5 minutes, it is no problems.  Highly endorsed!</li>
    <li> We purchased this for my husband because it has a balding clipper option.  It really isn&#x27;t functional as that type of shaver.  Not sure how it works otherwise.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! If you have or want a short cropped clean look this is the perfect tool. I&#x27;ve used one for years and finally wore it out and had to replace it. I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Works great, no issues.</li>
    <li> Works well but some issues with the on button.</li>
    <li> If you most just do short hair cut, then this is a great clipper.  The curved shaped really make those hair cut in the corner.  It fact is cordless make it even easier.  This clipper is design to cut very short hair only.  The clipper pretty poweful when is fully charger and does the job effortless.</li>
    <li> This worked perfect ay first I was nervous and did a just ok job but the second time I used it on 3 and went back and forth and really use it in all direction and worked great.  For the nay Sayers use it with a firm hand not gently and you will be happy with the results. Alan</li>
    <li> I had to return the 1st one, and the second is doing the same thing. I can charge it over night but it wont turn on. It will click but not turn on, like the battery is dead. Iv e owned this product for about 6 weeks including the 1st one. Its unfortunate because it works great for short and quick cuts, but i cant keep returning it every 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I found out, if you drop it on a hard surface from about 6 inches, it turns on.</li>
    <li> Always enjoy giving myself a haircut with this clipper</li>
    <li> It cuts well and saves a lot of money going to the barber shop.  Relubricate it twice a year and still cutting strong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I have a balding head. However, when my hair is cut very low, you can barely notice any bald spots. This shaver did cut low but after using it only one time fully and two small touch ups, it just died. I mean Died!!!!!!!! It overheated and just stopped working. Would not charge or anything. I like you read the previous reviews and went ahead and purchased it anyway thinking that the others just had bad luck. Trust me.....This shaver does not last at all. You will find yourself in this same situation as I find myself now.</li>
    <li> This is the best tool invented ince the butter knife.  It works great for my hair style.  Easy to use and easy to clean. If you are a guy and cut your own hair this is a must have.  The lowest setting is just a bit longer than shaving your head and takes a fracton of the time.  I love it.</li>
    <li> It really does the job but just not professionally.  The cut is even and it can only do simple haircut.  I like it!</li>
    <li> This is exactly like the one I bought several years ago.  I thought that one needed to be replaced because the clipper was running very slow, but after I ordered this new one I decided to try oiling the blades on the old one.  It&#x27;s amazing what happens when you actually follow directions.  The old one is running great, so I haven&#x27;t had to even unpack the new one.</li>
    <li> It works but it&#x27;s really no better than a conventional set of clippers. There are still curves to my head that this has a hard time getting at. Around the ears is tough too. I&#x27;m not sending it back though.</li>
    <li> The best short cut clippers on the market.. haven´t found any as good as these. Easy to use and takes hardly any time if you make sure to use them at least once a week.</li>
    <li> Very unique item and I was super excited to try it out!  I was able to cut my own hair, no problem and the result was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to use it a second time (little over a month later) and it won&#x27;t even charge.  Nothing.  Completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warranty is only 30 days, so I&#x27;m out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the one-time, $30 haircut Remington!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an nice product, good idea, but it has a major issue with the battery.&lt;br /&gt;The Battery take several hours to fully charge (&amp;#62;10 hours) and it barley finishes your cut. This product can&#x27;t&#x27;t be used when it&#x27;s hoked up to the AC for charging.&lt;br /&gt;After couple of months of use, the battery started getting worst and worst to the point that it doesn&#x27;t charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars for the design.</li>
    <li> simple to use and works very well</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product. With haircut prices hitting 20 bucks this well designed clipper pays for  it  self very quickly. Now if you must have a hair stylist this isn&#x27;t for you. The major problem is that one  can&#x27;t  see the hairline at the back. That&#x27;s where my wife comes in. If you keep your hair very short  no problem.  It&#x27;s easy to clean . You won&#x27;t get clipped with this clipper.</li>
    <li> This unit does not have enough power, unless you already have hair that is 1/4 inch in length. And the power varies while it is running through your hair, sometimes creating divots. The adjustable guide changes settings unless you firmly grip the number dial while you are clipping.     To get the cut I want would take a number of very, very slow passes. With a Wahl unit that I purchased recently it is one slow pass and you are done, and has many more length options and more sturdy ones at that. The power of the Wahl is what you might expect at a salon/barber shop.    Pass on this one and get a Wahl or something similar.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he says, \\&quot;In order to keep your hair short it works perfectly.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but I don&#x27;t need any help to use it and the maintenance is simple.  With it&#x27;s titainum blades and 4 year warranty it is next to none.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else, one month after I purchased, the batteries died completely. I charge it all day and only get 30 seconds of juice. Whats worse is that you can&#x27;t use it while it is plugged in, so at this point the clippers are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reaching out to Amazon and Remington to see if there is any recourse. I will update my review once I have some more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Amazon replaced my clippers without hesitation. My second set have been running flawlessly for months now. I love the curved shape of these clippers as well as the fact that they clip in either direction. Good product, apparently the first sets batteries were a fluke...</li>
    <li> Having used this for several times, really convenient for DIY haircut, and the maintenance is rather easy. One thing to note is the full battery charging takes a long time. And as it&#x27;s using Ni-MH battery, you&#x27;d better have it fully charged every time.</li>
    <li> Not as easy to use as it would seem.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to put knicks in your hair for an unattractive appearance.</li>
    <li> A couple of months ago I decided it was finally time to go over to a buzzcut. While I admittedly did not use this clipper for my initial shave-down, the Remington Short Cut has been perfect for maintaining my hair at a uniform 1/8\\&quot; stubble (longer settings are available, but I like it short). It is very easy and convenient to use and works exactly as it&#x27;s shown in the little promo video here on Amazon. The unique curved blade is what makes this particular clipper such a pleasure. Every morning I just run it back and forth over my scalp a couple of times while standing at the sink and then go take my shower. (Later, I can pull off the blade guard and knock any clippings still on the blade into the waste basket.) Looks perfect every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you&#x27;re thinking buzzcut, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this great product.</li>
    <li> First generation was alittle weak in the charging department, just bought a replacement and apparently Remington got the message. Holds a charge, keeps a charge. If you like your hair cropped short, this is a must have. End of story!</li>
    <li> It is a really nice hand-held unit... it&#x27;s pretty darn easy to use. Just slowly comb yer hair... it get&#x27;s shorter... My main issue and reason for 3 out of 5 stars is that the device is noisy. Sounds like a miniature lawn mower.  Other than that it&#x27;s not a bad little gadget.</li>
    <li> First I have to tell you that I trim my hair to the shortest I can. I&#x27;m bald and I like to trim instead of shaving my head. I used over 20 different trimmers, and I used them at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;This one has the best design for head trimming by far. I do not use the guides at all. I use it only to the max trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: best design.&lt;br /&gt;  Fast, since it covers a lot at once.&lt;br /&gt;  Great for short hair cut, almost shaved look.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: bad battery, long to charge, drain fast and ver weak.&lt;br /&gt;  Not well made.&lt;br /&gt;  Stuck a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that its good to keep lubricate and I use to run it under water for fast blade auction.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made it with a cord.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I had fairly short hair when I first went to use this on myself but I was still cutting off 1/2\\&quot; worth of hair.  I noticed right away that the trimmer blade is straight up and down rather then having two cutting surfaces going in opposite directions.  Why is this an issue?  This means that when you go to cut your hair it cuts off millions of tiny little pieces of your hair and leaves quite a mess.  I had been cutting my own hair with a regular Wahl clipper but it was tricky and I had to wait until my hair was fairly long in order to cut it easily.  This is the exact opposite of this Remington clipper.  The reason I ultimately like this device is that once your hair is short this clipper is great at keeping it short.  I simply run this clipper over my head at the end of every week and it does a great job of keeping my head short and neat.  The trick with this device is to cut your hair more frequently to maintain your style.  If you always wait for your hair to get somewhat long and then try to use this clipper, it will probably take longer and create a bigger mess then if you had tried doing it with traditional clippers.  If you want to maintain a short hair style (1/4\\&quot; or so) this works well for me.</li>
    <li> Didnt work that great doesnt really even cut that even assuming everyone has a perfect ball shapes head it might but thats unrealistic. I didnt like it used once never again.</li>
    <li> Very nice and good quality .. aslo am shaving my hair 4 times before recharg the battry</li>
    <li> Save your money!!  This is the second one I purchased. It was purchased in April of 2015 and the battery will not last more than 3 minutes on a full 24 hour charge. The same thing on the first one. Since the return policy is one month I will rip this apart to see if I can replace the batteries.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one of these. I love the design, but the battery sucks. The battery will hold less and less charge, and after 6-12 months you have to start charging it overnight before every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time around I will probably look for something more reliable, but I do love how this thing works.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, the only bad side about the machine is that is suitable to cut around the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it didnt come with UK socket adapter.</li>
    <li> I had one for less than a year, then the battery would not hold a charge.  The cutter itself did a fine job and I liked that.  If it worked with the unit plugged in I&#x27;d probably still be using it.  But once the battery would not hold a charge, I tossed it out.  I see Philips Norelco has a model and I might try that one.  They certainly know how to make good shavers, as I use one for my face now and the battery life is outstanding.</li>
    <li> Will soon be purchasing my third Remington Short Cut clipper, as it has proved to be the best method of getting a nice, short haircut at home. Too bad the quality of the haircut doesn&#x27;t apply to the quality of the Short Cut The first lasted almost two years before it started malfunctioning - although fully charged, it would periodically cut out, sometimes only running for a few seconds before having to re-press the power button to get it running again, repeating that process to get through one haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second one, purchased when the first one started to act up, will now be placed in service, and I’ll buy the third to serve as backup for when number two goes out (trying to plan ahead in case Remington stops making these). Still, at a cost of roughly $30 each, I’ve easily saved hundreds on haircuts by doing it myself at home. Just wish Remington would have delivered a better quality device, mechanically speaking.</li>
    <li> As the title says, these clippers have terrible battery life, but if you read the other reviews you know that already. Having said this, I love the fact that I can trim my own hair quickly. I am mostly bald, so I can&#x27;t justify paying for someone to cut my hair. Remington really needs to redesign this to have better battery life.</li>
    <li> We have two of these clippers in case one goes bad and the household starts looking shaggy.  Unless your hair is short I doubt you would be interested.  You may find use for it on some other part of your body.  If you have short hair or want short hair listen up!  You can cut your own hair or have someone help you out and check it over when your done.  It has several settings from a bit longer (like 3/4 or a bit less down to almost cut to the scalp on the lowest setting.  It is easy to use and has a guard to only cut as short as you have set.  You can also use a bit higher setting on top and lower setting for the sides.  I use one all over and get about an eighth of an inch long hair.  Hair is irrelevant and will become more so especially for men.  Get rid of that grey, and if you are balding cut off the rest of that hair~more attractive by far!  You will be glad you did.  Have a nice day!&lt;br /&gt;  SHORT HAIR RULES!</li>
    <li> worked great, easy to cut hair with but quit taking a charge within two months and outside return policy window. very disappointed. I noticed other pooor product reviews but was hopeful that there was product improvement over time.&lt;br /&gt;Not So.</li>
    <li> Great product. I read the instructions and charged the clippers.  I have short hair so I kept the clipper set to a higher setting till I gradually lowered it to my desired length.  These clippers will pay itself off in two uses.  Worth the cost and ready for the savings from not having to visit the barber.</li>
    <li> I have come to like this tool a lot.  It does not do everything and often it is necessary to break out a scissors or smaller trimmer to trim the hairs it missed.  But I had to do that anyway after I went for a haircut at the barber.  When I used to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I discovered that it could also act as a close cut trimmer on my neck if I just leave the guide off.  The blades are exposed like a close trimmer, so you just run it along your neck and it does a nice job. It helps if you plant a finger on your neck as a guide to cut down from so you don&#x27;t accidentally give yourself a Mohawk back there, but it does work without having to even see the back of your neck while you are cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So every couple of weeks after my workout at the gym I just run this thing over my head and then head into the shower.  Very efficient and fast.  It can&#x27;t get really close to your ears because of the size of the trimmer guide, so it helps to have another smaller head trimmer for close work around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works pretty well overall though, assuming you like a short and uniform haircut.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair left so this suits me fine.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. Lightning fried the first one when recharging it.&lt;br /&gt;No cord to fuss with. Does the job in less than half the time of conventional clippers.&lt;br /&gt;And does a much better job overall.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you want to cut your own hair or can have someone else do it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very compact, great maneuverability, light and easy to use. It holds a charge for a long time and doesn&#x27;t take too long to re-charge. The settings are great! Gets real close to you head.&lt;br /&gt;I had fun using it!&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;  -Chris</li>
    <li> This product cannot be used with the cord plugged in and it does not hold a charge so over the few months that I have owned it, I have used it perhaps once for a full haircut. If you buy this product you will need a backup clipper because it cannot be relied upon to do the job. I tried to return it but the window has closed. I was taken with the idea for a short cut clipper but it is a disaster. I have plugged it in the night before I want to use it and by the time I am ready to use it in the morning, it has charged and then lost its charge. There is no guide to exactly how long you need to charge it but it does need several hours minimum. A 20 minute charge does not allow you to complete the job.</li>
    <li> Like the video illustrates, this product is ONLY good for short hair cuts where you don&#x27;t mind having a single hair length all-around your head.  If you want a low-maintenance, quick and free haircut then this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would especially recommend this product for men with thinning hair who aren&#x27;t yet ready to shave their head but who understand that letting their hair grow-out will only accentuate their condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is NOT for attempting a fade or taper by yourself at home.  Trust me on this.  God made barbers for a reason!  Lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, this thing is great at keeping body hair in check.  This is where the curved blade design truly shines.  Back, arms, chest................as well as other areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only three stars?  Quality.  This is a poorly made product that just doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;m already on my fourth one of these.  Shoddy workmanship.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth clipper I have purchased for my husband in as many years.  He uses his daily and wears them out rather quickly.  He&#x27;s not the best for cleaning and oiling on a regular basis, so it would probably last longer for most.  He is mostly bald, so with this clipper being curved it&#x27;s easier for him to trim all the areas on his head.  He likes it so well, we have a spare, LOL.</li>
    <li> My husband has had this product before.  He liked it so much, that when it stopped running, we ordered two more.</li>
    <li> beats going to the barber, ran across by mistake on internet. read reviews and am satisfied. nice blue light on it.</li>
    <li> My son has always had very long hair, between ear length to shoulder length and I have zillions of photos of him running, playing, jumping, with his hair whipping around. A little athletic hippy he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then all of a sudden he wants it cut short. He&#x27;s six, so he should be able to decide for himself, but I asked him several times if he was sure and he said he was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sometimes, when I&#x27;m eating ice cream I get hair in my mouth.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;But are you sure?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;All my friends have short hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Okay, let&#x27;s do it.&amp;#34; I said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s where this baby, the Remington Short Cut Clipper comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I couldn&#x27;t take the machine straight to his head, shore his golden locks the way a sheepherder does sheep, so I got out my scissors and cut his hair, leaving about an inch all the way around. Pretty awful looking. Then I trimmed it with the highest setting and that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I&#x27;m not used to his hair looking like that, but he loves it. Something about looking like all the other kids, or at least with the ones he&#x27;s playing with now. Will he grow it back out, who knows, only time and styles will tell.</li>
    <li> I stand by this product, as it has saved me countless dollars per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought(first time through Amazon) in the past since 2008 or so if i recall. The first one couldn&#x27;t hold the charge anymore, due to what I believe was poor storage management.  As I would usually leave it plugged in for recharge in the bathroom where there&#x27;s constant moisture and leave it alone till I&#x27;m ready to use it again in 3 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little back story why I&#x27;ve bought this...Like many men, I&#x27;m starting to gradually lose hair.  And going to the barber has become, embarrassing sort of speak.  With this, I&#x27;ve been able to save the thought of believing that other people even bother to think what I look like, but it&#x27;s just that much more comforting knowing you don&#x27;t have to doubt yourself.  A typical trip to the barber will run me around $15 + tip, and that at least saved me $1,000 over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to how I use this.  There&#x27;s pretty much only 2 hair styles a person using this product can do by themselves.  1 - all around even cut or 2 - cut the sides short and leave the top longer with some scissors for room to style.  I will have to say, the first time using these clippers, I was inexperienced and it looked hideous.  But with practice comes perfection.  No one is perfect their first time so they might mark it off as a mistake.  But once you get a routine down, in 10 minutes you&#x27;ll have a style you&#x27;re accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I cut my hair, I lean over the tub. Make sure to use the default comb.&lt;br /&gt;1. Have the clippers on setting 2.&lt;br /&gt;2. Start with the back and go back and forth until the hair is clean.  Some tapping on the clipper may be required to remove the hair depending on how long your hair is.&lt;br /&gt;3. After that I proceed with the sides.&lt;br /&gt;4. Once that&#x27;s done, setting 1.5 on the back and work my way up from the bottom to maybe earlobe height.&lt;br /&gt;Set it to 1 and cover half way of the 1.5 setting.&lt;br /&gt;5.Set it to 3 and cut the rim between the sides and top.&lt;br /&gt;6. Depending what you want, it&#x27;s your choice to go from there.  But I highly suggest using the same comb filter on 4 setting and just clip it through to see how it looks on you.&lt;br /&gt;7. Use the slider to clip the hair around your ears that the normal clipper couldn&#x27;t get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve used it ,after I got more used to it, things went very well. Hair was longer the first time , had to brush it out three times, easy to do. Hair was shorter the second time, brushed it out only twice. Does not take long .It is faster and easier to use then the regular hair clippers. No cord a plus.  Very good haircut kit.</li>
    <li> I received my Remington Short Cut Cordless Clipper kit damage free and a day early. I charged it as soon as it arrived and used it the very next day. The only thing that would make a haircut any easier would be purchasing the \\&quot;Self-Cut System Haircutting Mirror\\&quot; [...]. My hair was much longer then a 1/2\\&quot;, approximately 1 1/2\\&quot; - 2\\&quot; in length, so it took me a while to get my hair down to the #3 setting on the top and the #2 on the side. I had to remove the hair collecting in the adjustable comb often to clear the blade of cut hair so it could do it job. Besides the mirror so you&#x27;d have a free hand the only other thing I wish is that it would work when plugged in. It took me so long on my first use, since my hair hadn&#x27;t been cut in over 2 months, that the clipper ran out after a full charge. Luckily I had a beard trimmer to finish the few hairs left to cut on the top and trim around the ears and neck areas. I gave this product a 5 since it does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product, it does not cut as short as promised in the description.  If you are looking for an extremely short cutting clipper, keep looking very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a \\&quot;bald guy\\&quot;, and got tired of waiting in line at a barber or other place for a hair cut.  This product works great, however the battery life is short when using.  It only takes me about 3-4 minutes to buzz down my hair, but near the end is sounds like the battery is nearly dying.  It does charge up quickly, ready for the next use.  I don&#x27;t mind re-charging between each use, but I&#x27;m wondering over time if the battery will not hold a charge.  You cannot use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (which is good, to keep fools form using near water!), but if the battery life goes dead during use at some point, this will not be good.  It does seem to re-charge quickly.</li>
    <li> I like it but with reservations.  I&#x27;ve bought this Remington twice now.  The first one I bought crapped out after a year of use.  I wear my hair at the lowest setting.  It does the job for about 35 haircuts or so, but then seems to clog up no matter how often you try to clean it.  The best results come if you use it every other day or every third day so that it isn&#x27;t dealing with a lot of hair to cut.  No matter what anyone says ... I also DO NOT advise letting water get anywhere near it.  To my mind, no company has really come up with a convenient product yet that will easily and reliably keep your hair short and last long enough to be a real bargain.  The Remington Short Cut Clipper is as close as you can get to this standard...  but still not worthy of raving about...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen many of the same reviews for this product. I&#x27;ve been using this device for years, and it works great. But the battery they chose for this device is pretty bad. As you cut your hair, it will speed up and slow down for no reason. It also doesn&#x27;t always hold a very long charge, so I keep it plugged in all the time. Unfortunately, for some reason they designed the device not to work while plugged in. It&#x27;s battery or nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, it does a great job when it&#x27;s working. I cut my hair once a week. If you get lucky and receive one that lasts a year or so, you&#x27;re paying $30 for 75 haircuts or so. It&#x27;s still MUCH cheaper than having someone else do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased my third device, and it was delivered dead, unable to hold a charge. I&#x27;m sending it back in exchange for another to see if I can get lucky again. If you get one that works, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Received 3 units, the 1st one would not charge, the 2nd unit didn&#x27;t charge up and operate ether, the 3rd unit did charge up and is operating ok. The hair cut was quick and looked very good. I think that only one working out of 3 isn&#x27;t a very good average.</li>
    <li> I decided to go with a buzz cut in an effort to simplify my life.  My wife had previously cut my hair, but I was always pestering her.  Now I can do it myself.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the Short Cut.  It was great to save $15.00 off my hair cut.  It was very easy to use and quick.  I will use it every two weeks because my hair (as little as there is) grows back fast.</li>
    <li> This product is a replacement for the same identical product I bought (somewhere else) 6 years ago.  I use it every other day.  It is a great tool.</li>
    <li> So far this clipper has been great.  I love the curved shape and the fact that you recharge it and don&#x27;t have to deal with a cord while you use it.  A great product.  Also great that you can adjust  the cutting depth.</li>
    <li> This product is a great, easy, and quick way to give yourself a haircut and save money. Works and charges perfectly, I&#x27;m saving lots of money each time I use it! It of course is best for short hair as the title states, but its cuts evenly and accurately. I would recommend this product for those who want to maintain their close haircut without constantly running out to a barber. I also suggest starting off with the highest setting and working your way down to the closest setting depending on your hair texture and preferences. For the money you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> If you keep it short this clipper is for you money well spent and saving money too I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> This clipper will do the job for you.  I won&#x27;t be using setting \\&quot;1.5\\&quot; again, since that&#x27;s only a 16th of an inch longer than setting 1, and 3/16 of an inch is a little too shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on using setting \\&quot;2\\&quot; next time, which is a quarter inch.  Should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to but I think it&#x27;s a lot easier to use than standard clippers.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Why hadn’t anyone thought of this before? This is the clipper I have been waiting for!  Works GREAT: I use it in the shower for about 5 min/week to keep my hair perfectly short, my wife&#x27;s so happy she doesn’t have to cut my hair anymore!</li>
    <li> I purchased hoping this would be the answer to self cutting nightmares. In fact it has become more of a nightmare. This unit is extremely underpowered for the task at hand, frequent clogs, poor cutting performance, missed areas due to clogging, not very close of a cut, and loves to pull on hair. Remington seemed uninterested in assisting with the problems and thus it has been relegated to a back seat of being in the closet in case I have no other option. *Does work for reducing facial hair after a weeks growth.*</li>
    <li> My wife uses this clipper on me once every 3 weeks and it works great.  Just remember to only plug it in about an hour before using it and the battery will last a long time.  Do not leave plugged into charger from cut to cut because the battery will not last.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic clipper, if you&#x27;re going for a short, even cut. The only reason I&#x27;ve given it 4 instead of 5 stars is that after a year or so (of cutting my hair at least once a week), it loses its charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it costs about as much as 2 visits to the barber, I&#x27;m very happy to buy a new one every 12-16 months. It still is much more convenient and cost effective than going to a barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I&#x27;m buying my 4th one (over the course of 5 or 6 years). Do the math...&lt;br /&gt;4 shavers &#x3D; $120&lt;br /&gt;1 cut a week for 5 years @ $10 each &#x3D; $2600&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s easy math for me!</li>
    <li> Easy to use tool to keep his hair trimmed in between barber visits, a great money saver. It holds the charge throughout his grooming process</li>
    <li> Clippers would not turn off. When the battery finally ran down, it refused to recharge. Nice idea, not nice execution.</li>
    <li> Great clippers!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful device for someone like me who is mostly bald and just needs to have what fringe I still have neatly trimmed.  Its curve fits the head very well and I&#x27;ve save a lot of money that otherwise would have been spent on visits to the barber.  It also holds its charge extremely well.  I&#x27;ve had it a couple of months, used it several times, and I still haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it.  It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product, while it works. I&#x27;ve had 2 sets of these and they are awesome at first. Over the course of about a year, both sets began slowing. Eventually the built in battery died,  leaving them inoperable and unable to recharge.</li>
    <li> This is not truly a hair cutting device, but a device that should be used once you&#x27;ve got your&lt;br /&gt;low cut hair style the way you want it.  No real versatility here.  Simply, how low can you go.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend using this once a week or so, depending on how fast your hairs grows.  I will continue to use this&lt;br /&gt;product since I purchased it, but if I had the chance to do it over, I would pass it by,</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and I got this clipper so that I would not have to shell out so much for professional haircuts. Since I got this clipper I have cut it too short one time and raggedly cut it the second time. I also have a difficult time trimming my sideburns with the edge clipper without getting tangles and pulled hairs. I guess I will have to go back to expensive haircuts again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  His old one quit working.  Glad I could find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s great for him to cut his own hair because it is curved and covers more area than the regular hair clippers.</li>
    <li> This thing works just fine and it exactly what I was looking for, it only has one huge glaring flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes forever to charge-- I mean like all night long. Then the battery lasts just about 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to make matters worse, YOU CAN&#x27;T JUST USE IT PLUGGED IN, EITHER. It won&#x27;t run plugged in through the charging wire. You have to let it sit hours and hours and hours, and it only runs once charged. And if you charge it and let it sit a month while your hair grows... all the charge is gone when it&#x27;s time to go.</li>
    <li> I have had this for six month and have been satisfied with the way it cuts my hair, BUT it is NOT useable now because it will not charge or run off of the power cord.  They need to improve the batteries and or charging system. Or at least have a way of changing the batteries.</li>
    <li> Great product, makes hair cutting a breeze and cost effective. Also makes looking well groomed, an everyday look. Thanks Remington and Amazon.com ++++++</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well. It takes forever to recharge. Product would be far better if it wasn&#x27;t cordless. When it is charged, it works great. Design makes sense for the head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so user- friendly and you need no barber with it. just the cliper and a mirror and the rest will follow!&lt;br /&gt;Awsome product guys!</li>
    <li> good quality, charge lasts as long as needed i  would have liked it to cut closer to the skin. good product</li>
    <li> It does not cut my hair, nor my sons (5 years old)&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown it out.&lt;br /&gt;two stars is too generous, but it did arrive on time.</li>
    <li> This is my second one and it is easy to use.  I had my first one for 5 years and used it a lot.</li>
    <li> Great concept and design but deplorable execution and build quality. Who is the person that designed it not to work while plugged in....very dumb. Plus the battery is absolutely terrible.</li>
    <li> This product is a great concept. Works very well over several months. However, this is not a long lasting product. If taken good care of it will last a year max. Do not get this product near water or even steam. Exposure to water speeds the breakdown cycle that will happen. I have owned 3 now and they all do the same slow dying process. It seems the battery corrodes.  In the end you get your money&#x27;s worth but I do wish this product lasted longer. Very convenient with great results. People think i&#x27;m at the barber everyday.</li>
    <li> This is my third clipper.  They do a great job on balding guys like me BUT the battery life is very short.  Usually, they last a bout a year and that is even if I continually charge the battery.</li>
    <li> This makes it so easy for my husband to buzz his own hair, at his convenience. Happy Man, Happy Wife!!</li>
    <li> Worked OK the first time.  Month later and fully charged used it and it &amp;#34;konked&amp;#34; out half way thru cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Recharged it 24 hours and tried it again, but it still would not run&amp;#62; AT ALL.  Had to go to a barber to clean up the mess it left me on my head. No more Remington products from china for me!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought that trimmer three years ago, and very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, and my head always looks nice and neat. Using it each week for last three years, and with such pattern of usage, the cutting hair became a formality, and take not more than 5 minutes, and one charge is enough for 3 haircuts. The long re-charging time is not a problem for me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy another one if my will die.</li>
    <li> Its pretty uncomfortable for doing it by yourself. razor levels are pretty good you dont have to change anything. I</li>
    <li> This stinks, plus the comb hurts your scalp for good measure.  I upgraded this to a Norelco QC5550 and thought that was a lot better for a while, but that one broke too.  I just got an Oster Fast-Feed and I love it.  Don&#x27;t worry about the cord.  Use an extension cord if you need to, no sweat.</li>
    <li> like it but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge long</li>
    <li> Got 135 haircuts with my last one. That works out to 25 cents per cut. GOOD DEAL</li>
    <li> This is my third set of clippers - I use them once a week!</li>
    <li> One of the best buys I ever made at Amazon. The lowest setting does not get you \\&quot;skinhead\\&quot; but more like \\&quot;next day\\&quot; (which is fine. I also used on my face &amp; \\&quot;area below\\&quot; &amp; it was great.  Easy clean-up &amp; easy to use</li>

    <li> This is the perfect manscaping tool.  It works great for getting your hair on your head really short before using the Bald Eagle Pro to electrically shave your head bald.</li>
    <li> Wonderful ,I now have two one for Mi. And Fl.</li>
    <li> Whoo hooo. No more long waits in a barber or beauty chair. This is amazing. Easy to use and the two guide attachments snap in place and the height adjusted with a numbered roller. It is light weight aaaaannnndddd you can clean it in water. The edger slides out with a simple push with one finger. It is battery operated with rechargeable batteries but it is not sluggish at all. It is mistake proof.....no kidding. I am a female with health issues and growing and grooming hair has been drama in the past. Now I can take care of myself and not complain about the wait,price or awful cuts or service lol. My husband and children all gave thumbs up on my first cut. Oh yeah I am getting another one just in case somebody decides to stop selling them. Great investment.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these Remington Short Cut Clipper few years back. It did a great job and I was very satisfied. After a few years of weekly use I thought that it was time to get a new one. Which I just did. I love the fact that this device follows the contour of the head and it actually provides a short trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again and I highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor</li>
    <li> bought for my husband. He is very pleased with the Remington.Easy to use. Even used it on his beard. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this is the battery seems to die very soon and takes a long time to charge. This is my third set and I like the way it cuts but the batteries not the best and you have to oil it every time you use it</li>
    <li> What can I say, this thing rocks....No more going to the barber shop and wasting time. Just set the buzz height, run it through your head just like a comb and watch it work. My only hope is that the blade&#x27;s don&#x27;t loose their sharpness too fast. What a great functional idea and design.</li>
    <li> This type is of slippers is nt for me. The hair always gets caught in the comb of the slippers. Since my hands were a lil wet it ws very difficult to take out the hair. I hd to use my electric shaver fr a close cut. I returned of course.</li>
    <li> This is the 5th one I&#x27;ve bought in the past 3 years, which tells you something.  I use it to buzz my head all the way down, use the bare blades without any blade guide.  Takes less than 5 minutes and works great every time.  There&#x27;s nothing else like it, unique design, just an awesome little clipper, except for one thing.  With each clipper I&#x27;ve purchased, after about 9 months to 1 year, the charge light on the clipper suddenly fails to light, so the unit won&#x27;t charge, then it stops working.  But I love it so much that I always keep two charged up, ready for one to run out -- or FAIL.  Remington could have used better lithium ion batteries, but they are content to make as is, and have me keep buying one per year.  They cost about $25.00 (cheap), so it&#x27;s worth it -- I make my money back after one haircut.  I was thinking about bringing my next discard to Interstate Batteries to see if they could put a decent battery in it -- I just might.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cordless clipper for a while and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this one. It isn&#x27;t clear from the instructions, but you can completely remove all of the guards (one is showing in the picture of the product) and shave your head. It is a nice clean shave. The best part is the huge cutting surface. I can stand in my shower and shave my head in about 3 minutes). It says you can leave it plugged in for up to 2 weeks without using, so I always know it is fully charged. It does come with a little oil which is nice. I&#x27;d recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> Husband bought this to cut his own hair.  It has worked fine.  He can do it himself which is nice.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve owned. 1 was lost in Afghanistan (thanks Army) and I used the other one to death.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those without a lot of hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it reliably for close to a year, no complaints about function or battery life.  Small, easy to use, portable.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a great value. Excellent job trimming short hair over entire head. I tried it on my beard but was not real happy with results. Product is made to cut short hair on the head and does that very well</li>
    <li> The clipper is easy to use and clean and up to this point seems to hold its sharpness, however even when starting with already short hair its battery has a tendency to discharge before completion of the task, at times.</li>
    <li> It rates 5 stars if the batteries in this one lasts better than the others I have had. The job it does is great!</li>
    <li> This thing is the best. First of all, I can shave my head in the shower thus avoiding having to clean up the mess I am used to. For those complaining about not being able to have it plugged in while using it, 2 things: 1. I have never had an issue with it running out of  battery before I finish shaving my head/body 2. This is obviously a safety precaution so the very special ones out there will not shower while it is still plugged in. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the difficulty in shaving around my ears. The attachment is nice for trimming up sideburns but to maintain an equal length around the ears can be difficult. However, I can pretty much fold down the helix of my ear and get a good cut. If you have to shave your head often, this thing can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This item completely died in June. It would not take a charge. I threw it away which sucks because I really liked it.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have bought this clipper and it works very well&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair every week and I get comments on the look.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> I already own an identical clipper, so this one is a backup.  Although not perfect, it suits me better than any of the alternatives.</li>
    <li> My 3rd one died without much warning, much like what every other reviewer says in here : The battery just wont recharge anymore. The irrelevant blue light dies away (irrelevant, because on my other previous 2, one never lighted up, and the other bulb died within a week)...and here I am ordering my 4th and 5th copy (for backup). And you should too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;- Shape : The only one of its kind that is shaped like a comb. I have tried other better lasting brand - but! I need someone to watch my back. This thing? Just have a steady left and right hand...and I can shave my hair in 10 mins by myself. LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;- Cordless : Meaningless - because everyone here wants it to be corded instead. It doesnt operate when the cord is connected, so once the battery is dead, you are so out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;- Money saver! Before, I cut my hair once every 2 months at the barber for 25 bucks. in 2 years, i&#x27;d have spent 300 dollars at the barber! For 12 haircut. Now, instead, I buy 2 of these for a 100 dollars, and cut my hair once every 3 weeks. Just before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My worse fear is for the company to instead make a better product - to stop producing these things. I may stockpile these things when I have enough money :p.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, remington - can you fix this item? I love it and hate it lol.</li>
    <li> I am balding; so I started to shave my head. But being a lazy person I did not shave every day; maybe once or twice a month. Soon I gave up on shaving and started to use clippers, because my hair would be too long. With the clippers I needed my wife&#x27;s help to clean up the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product about a month back, since then, I have not had to ask anyones help and because it is practically effortless, I cut my hair every weekend. I have a round head and with this product I get excellent cut.</li>
    <li> This is the second unit I own. They are good at first, when they are fairly new. But over time (couple of years) battery charge does not hold for long and eventually the device becomes useless. Having said that, it does what it is supposed to do very well, if only for a period of time. But what did you expect for the price? Fot it to last 10 years?</li>
    <li> It was already dead when I received it. It does not charge.&lt;br /&gt;I did not even bother asking for a replacement unit after I read the other reviews indicating that this piece of junk would have died very soon.</li>
    <li> Very good for short hair for what it is intended</li>
    <li> Great Product. cuts good, battery life good, could probably shave a porkupine..</li>
    <li> Good idea, but it doesn&#x27;t cut very well.  I use it on 1mm setting for super short.  You have to rub it back and forth so much it&#x27;s extremely irritating.  Even then, it doesn&#x27;t cut evenly.  I gave up after using it  few times.</li>
    <li> battery does not hold a charge for very long. i am very disappointed</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my son to make his haircuts quick and painless. So far so good but the only complaint I have is that you can&#x27;t use the clippers while plugged in. Other than that great product.</li>
    <li> Its a good product for the need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> a Great hair clipper&lt;br /&gt;I had an old style clipper I&#x27;ve been using for 20 years to cut my own hair with, and it was on its last legs when I decided to get this.&lt;br /&gt;It does a find job, and  it s a lot more manageable for cutting your own hair.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Keeps my hair buzzed way down as short as I want without actually shaving my head.</li>
    <li> Good Product.  It&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon and hard to find elsewhere.  Use it on every part of my body.  Down sides: I&#x27;ve had to buy 3 over the last 4 years.  I&#x27;ve learned they don&#x27;t survive falls well, and although waterproof, I try to keep it out of the water as much as possible, I lost one to water damage.  Keeping the blades well oiled conserves the weak battery life it has too.  If you want to clean it right, you almost have to have a high pressure air compressor.  Anyway, that&#x27;s my review.  Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t try to help you out.  :-)</li>
    <li> Nice for cutting the right Curve of the head.</li>
    <li> easy to use and cuts close - only problem is the battery life.</li>
    <li> When using this - if you want a bald look ok - the comb part that is supposed to keep the length at a certain height will slip and reduce the height of the hair giving you a splotching look to where you just go with the shortest length and be done with it. It clogs up and is not easy to clean. Will not buy it again......</li>
    <li> Works great and I love it. I read all the reviews and am aware that Remington used the cheapest rechargeable batteries available. Phillips Norelco razors are similar. The cheaper the razor the cheaper the batteries, the longer the charging time. If you want this product to last, you only recharge it when necessary and never leave it plugged in. The batteries will develop a memory and appear to be dead. What I don&#x27;t understand is why Remington uses rechargeable at all. Just fit it with a battery holder and let the purchaser put his own batteries in it. That way the product would last forever. Then again, if this product only lasted one year, 12 haircuts would cost you $2.67 each. Buy a new one every January.</li>
    <li> Good price--does a good job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product for short single length hair cuts.  I would have given it five stars if the recharge time was quicker.  15+ hours is a long time to wait.</li>
    <li> If I could give this no stars I would. This is the most HORRIBLE product I have ever used. I will NEVER buy another Remington product EVER!!! The battery NEVER held its charge. It died in the middle of a haircut ALL of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bought this several years ago was because I had a very old electric clipper that I used for my son&#x27;s hair. In order to use it I would have to use a knife to make sure the unit stayed tightly together other wise there was a loud noise while it cut. After awhile I got tired of having to do the &amp;#34;little trick&amp;#34; to keep the sound low and threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Remington as a Christmas gift. Worst present I ever bought!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for four, going on five years now. Use them once a week min, every day max, for beard and head. I cut my head to the lowest setting. When I did use the attached length comb, it clogged if I didn&#x27;t use it regularly.  No biggie, take the guard off, shake out the hair, keep going. I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s a big deal as stated in some reviews.  I charge it over night so I can&#x27;t speak for charge time. The battery still holds a charge as long as it always had so quality on some units may have been an issue or may be a new issue. Don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is the blades are gummed up now, but it&#x27;s not a design flaw, it&#x27;s a partner doesn&#x27;t know grease from machine oil problem.</li>
    <li> Works great, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far but if it last a year I feel I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth and would buy another one</li>
    <li> This clipper does a perfect job of following the contour of your head for an even and consistent hair cut.</li>
    <li> Good equipment, does the job!</li>
    <li> I keep my hair short and this product was just what I was looking for to avoid the frequent trips to the barber.  It indeed functioned as I hoped, and I would have given it five stars if not for the battery issue.  As others have reported the batteries lose their ability to hold a charge after a few months.  I like the product enough that I am ordering another one, hoping to get better battery performance.  If the batteries on this one fail I will have to try something else.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I did an excellent job of scalping myself.  Problem: Used the super-short comb.  Now, cutting my hair is a breeze.  There is a wheel to set the length of hair.  The regular comb won&#x27;t let you scalp yourself.  I finish up around the back, over the ears and sideburns by turning the wheel and making the cut a little shorter.  Be methodical, slow down, enjoy the scalp massage, and save yourself $20 and a trip to the hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This utilizes a single blade cutting vertically.  As you brush back and forth, the hair is trimmed to the depth you set. There are two combs.  One for cutting right down to the scalp, the other for a uniform depth.  I think the max length hair is about 1/2 inch. Min is probably about 1/8 inch.  There is a wheel to set the depth.  A brush to clean the blade, and oil to keep it lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need this if you like your hair shorter.  Terrific product.</li>
    <li> This is not a good trimmer. I thought that I would love it and it turns out that the charge does not last and is dead after 2 uses. KEEP LOOKING! THIS IS NOT A GOOD BUY</li>
    <li> As a balding male who often makes trips to the barber to get his head buzzed, I thought this would be a good way to save a few bucks.  I&#x27;m at the stage where I need to shave my head probably every 2-3 weeks in order to maintain a nice sleek look, so you can guess how costly that would become over a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself seemed simple enough to use.  It&#x27;s shaped like a comb and everyone has combed their hair at one point or another!  Put both ideas together and it should be a breeze, right?!  Well kind of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The biggest issue with this device is the battery.  After the initial use, it seems to die down really quickly no matter how long you charge it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The comb design sounded neat but it&#x27;s really quite a disaster.  I&#x27;ve notice that shaving the sides or the back of my head to be extremely difficult.  Assuming your head is shaped like a volleyball, the sides of your head are slightly less curved then the top.  This means that there is a slight gap between both edges of the blade when your cutting.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my head but I&#x27;ve struggled mightly with trimming the sides and back with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, I used it twice and it&#x27;s sat in the cupboard since.  If you want to buy something that&#x27;s effective, I suggest a standard clipper like you find it most barber shops.  I&#x27;d also suggest buying a device that requires a power cord as oppose to battery.  It may be a bit of a nuisance at times, but I&#x27;ll take good old reliable over a draining batter any day.</li>
    <li> EDIT: It wasn&#x27;t the battery. I did some research after writing this review, and saw that if you don&#x27;t clean and oil the blades, regularly, it gets bogged down on debris. So I cleaned and oiled the blades... and it was resurrected! Working as good now as the day I bought it, batteries and all. Perhaps eve a bit better as the blades are self sharpening. If you&#x27;re using it on your scalp, don&#x27;t be overzealous around any moles that might have some height to them. You&#x27;ll give them a good scrape. Other than that, still fantastic. Changing it to four and a half stars - I&#x27;d go 5 if it were a little less maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL: When adequately powered, this works great. I loved it, at first. The problem is that the device can only run off the battery* and the battery went south almost immediately. Within a couple months it would still be weak directly after charging and the motor would wind down to nothing before I could trim my entire beard. It&#x27;s currently unusable. My beard grows faster than this thing can trim it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*plugging it in the power cord puts it in charge mode and shuts off the motor)</li>
    <li> Replacing one I bought before that the battery died out. Well worth the money. It more than paid for itself after two uses in the money I saved cutting my on hair and not going to the barber.</li>
    <li> It is a great concept, but it doesn&#x27;t hold its charge well and is not well made.  One of the comb attachments broke and made it almost useless.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DIED AFTER THE SECOND CHARGING I WILL NEVER NEVER BUY A REMINGTON PRODUCT ( LINE) AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! cheap and....</li>
    <li> Bought my first one of these just over three years ago but eventually the batter became weak and it was not worth my time or money to replace since it is a sealed unit and not intended to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are used to a plug in electric clipper you will be dissapointed until you use this a few times and get used to how it works. I use this exclusively for my own haircuts now and leave the plug in Brawn in the drawer. When cutting it is important not to take too much at once and to shake out the comb/guard often so that it does not clog and bog the unit down. Because this is waterproof I am able to cut my hair every 2-3 weeks in the shower and there is no major cleanup. Just rinse everything down the drain and rinse the unit off under the faucet. Just give it a good oil coat after or before use and always charge before use and this unit will work well for you. Be sure to give it a few charge/drain-by-using cycles before giving up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could change anything on it, I would include the cut length for both guards - unit only includes cut length for the short guard. Also, I would make the batteries replaceable. I took my old unit apart and because the batteries are sealed and soldered in place it isnt worth replacing them when they die after 3 years.</li>
    <li> No need to pay for a close cut. Do it yourself whenever you need it. Use it in the shower and no cleanup problems.</li>
    <li> These work great if you use them regularly.  If you use them regularly then it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to cut your own hair without any assistance.  But if your hair is long then it will take longer because you have to constantly clean the cut hair out of the clippers.  I highly recommend these and they will pay for themselves with just two uses depending of course how much you pay for a haircut.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Curved cordless trimmer.  They worked great except fot battery issues.  Had to return 2 during warranty period but got replacements easily.  My last one worked for over 2 years and then battery quit.  I looked everywhere for new  trimmer and then got it by mail order. It is working great&lt;br /&gt;NVG</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use, makes less work of cutting hair and fast too!  No more $15 haircuts for me!</li>
    <li> So simple. So fast. And perfect every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No muss, no fuss, and at only $30 it&#x27;s an easy decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice barber style cutters are great, but this has a nice wide, curved blade that cuts in both directions, and that&#x27;s a huge benefit you won&#x27;t REALLY appreciate til you try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered when I first opened it whether it could deliver an even and very close cut, whether it was really of that quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best $30 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. This really simplifies life. And if the rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t last as many reviewers claim, there are better models for a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will qualify this review by stating that I&#x27;ve only used it at the closest setting (1 &#x3D; 1/8\\&quot;). On that setting it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m adding this after owning and using this product for approximately 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;I have had zero battery issues. I bought 2 so that I can let the battery run out completely before charging it, which should help tremendously with battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t be used when the charger is plugged in, so I just grab the other one and let the dead one charge fully until the blue charge light turns on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many, most of whom have used regular barber clippers for years, and they all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark&lt;br /&gt;HB, Ca.</li>
    <li> Easiest way to cut your own hair I have ever experienced.</li>
    <li> Works great...before the batteries die. I am on the seventh one of these, because the batteries only last about 6-12 months for me cutting my hair every 1-2 weeks. However, it is a great concept. I actually buy mine from another company that are more expensive initially, but have a lifetime guarantee. So when the battery quits, I send the clippers back and they send me a new one. I am only out the price of the shipping each time. It would also be nice if they would make the clippers, so they would run plugged in with the cord, but they only run unplugged with the battery. Having watched several YouTube videos, I am now also going to try the Philips DIY model and post a review comparing the two clippers.</li>
    <li> Had the Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable for about 6 months and its now broke. Won&#x27;t turn on..</li>
    <li> I have bought a number of these as their batteries seem to last only 1 to 2 years.  Remington may have fixed this problem as I find the battery on this newest one holds a charge much better than the previous ones.  As to how well it works.  It does as long as you take your time.</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington clipper.  It is the only clipper I have found to be shaped like my head so it works well and quick with blades that go back and forth.  Only downside is the battery starts out strong but after a year or so it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  When it works - it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I had have one of these before and it is the best utensil for cutting my husbands hair. It works a treat.</li>
    <li> The Remington&#x27;s scc-100 short cut is a great tool for short hair and saving money from going to the barber. It stays sharp, holds a good charge ( only for a year or longer by months) but still saving $8 to $15 its worth it. You can also fade if you try. Its much quicker than a regular hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works  just fine, I cut my hair more frequently now.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hold charge the first time I use it. And I need to pay for shipping this fraud back.</li>
    <li> This clipper is great for trimming and touchups.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and this is the best clipper I&#x27;ve used yet.  The only thing to watch for is as you&#x27;re cutting your hair, if you push too hard the dial will not stay put and you will end up with a much shorter cut than you wanted.  Otherwise it is fast and easy.  I try to use it weekly for touch ups.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after 2 months. A piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clipper.  I got this clipper for my self to cut my hair.  The clipper has very sharp &amp; fast blades.  The clipper gets your hair cut under ten minutes. It comes with a power charger, clipping blades, &amp; a cleaning brush.  Great product for the do it your selfers.</li>
    <li> ....I wud recommend this product to my twin brother....it works so well......nice to be able to cut ur own hair without a worry....</li>
    <li> Have used this since early December,  it works well to cut hair, you need to be very careful and cautious with the settings and clippers at first.  Less is more initially. Requires several stop and clearing out the teeth before going again as well as well oil to keep the blades in tip top shape.  I would recommend using a mirror to make sure you can attain an even cut on the areas you can&#x27;t see.  I have made my share of hair mistakes with this and would say go slow and have a pail/ brush/broom ready for cleanup.  Would recommend cleaning frequently it does the trick.  Update April 15&#x27;: Purchased this item in December of 2013 and still running strongly.  Religiously clean the blades and use a Q-tip inside the unit as well as oil the blades.  I never use the attached trimmer I find it too difficult and rigid to use.  I would recommend a separate one for around the ears/sideburns/neck area.  As far as cutting pretty easy to adjust and maintain.  Haven&#x27;t gone for a haircut in a long while and this unit has paid for itself time and time again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes close cutting much quicker and uniform than clippers.  I cut my hair in the shower with a shower mirror before I turn on the water.  The latest iteration is improved with water rise off and continuous charging.</li>
    <li> Love the rechargeable function, no cord to limit your hand movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a few try to learn the best angle and hand movement for styling. It works well and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is that you need to clean the blade every few second for the best cutting result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great product, and it price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> 05/01/2013&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the first clipper - from Kroger, Supermarket - and it worked very well the first three months. I am the only one to use it, I have a very thin hair, and at age of 72 not a lot of hair left. After each usage I cleaned it up and oil it. I used it only on clean and dry hair. It would just not start all of a sudden! The battery seems to be charged, however when I press the starting button a red light comes on - but the clipper would not start.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the second clipper, also from Kroger, because I liked the concept and the way it worked, while it worked. It broke down just like the first product. So, I spent about $60.0 for a few months of service.&lt;br /&gt;First, for such a small device to depend on the battery is wrong, unless there are other problems. If the battery is the main problem I think they should offer a corded clipper, especially that they can squeeze in $1 to $2 extra charge just to keep the \\&quot;free market\\&quot; intrinsic \\&quot;opportunity to rip-off, and just because the customer is very important to us\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this bad product. Go to \\&quot;[...]\\&quot; and read the reviews first. It is a much simpler concept and many people used their device, lasting up to 14 years, without any problem. In addition, all the members of the family can use it - as many \\&quot;lady of the house\\&quot; have written in their review. Even more, the vacuum collects all cut hair, so no mess to clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;Based on Flowbee reviews I should recover this investment in six months, just because, in my case, I am the only one to use it. If more members of your family use this product you should recover this investment in two-three months. I ordered the Flowbee Haircutting System $134.99 from Amazon with delivery around May 6th.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these about 18 months ago. It stopped working 2 weeks ago. But if I factor how many times I would have had to pay for a haircut and the slight cost they charge for this product, it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great for those of us that enjoy not having to comb our hair. It&#x27;s not perfect. But it does the job. And it does the job cheap enough that I&#x27;m here buying another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it breaks down, I&#x27;ll be back for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so worth the money!</li>
    <li> Perfect for me as I have less hair to cut every day.  Takes about 5-10 minutes and you really need to sweep it back and forth a few times to get at all the hair, but really the best way for me to do it all by myself</li>
    <li> Well there&#x27;s only one how to use and for to use this product.I have used many different since i self learned how to cut hair (all types).I have used many various products such as what was the top of the class then (andis),I had a speed master which still worked great after 21 years except for a broken fader,I was given a andis master which i had to rebuild (metal&#x3D;gets too hot)and many differnt wahl&#x27;s (cheap enclosed plastic,also get too hot in intricate fading hair cuts&#x3D;why i had about 5 or 7 clippers and about 4 trimmers/edgers two andis  which of course broke,one wahl i gave away from dificulty to find blades and oster which still i have.And now compairing this clipper to them,It is quieter,almost as powerful,runs cool for the time in use,plus it adds 3 different machines into one plus no checking for guards.Aint designed for work or barbers,just for the personal touch-ups and also requires relearning all you have learned about hair cutting it is almost rotates the knowledge 90 degrees and the knowledge of the different zones of the head and more combing than standard clippers but the larger cutting surface cuts down your difficulty with time about to 1/2 to 1/3 .</li>
    <li> It worked once then stopped working. The charger light turns on when I charge it. After a while, it turns off which I think means it&#x27;s fully charged. When I press the button, nothing happens.</li>
    <li> I like to keep hair around 1.5 inch, this does not do that job.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  Guard tends to scratch.</li>
    <li> Works quite well, just it is a little bit hard to take it a part for cleaning purposes. It would be nice if it would have some case to store it in.</li>
    <li> Completely worthless as  trimmer...Oh, it might be a great trimmer but will never know due to battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.  Needs to be corded.  Design also puts too much pressure on the blades so they do not oscillate easy enough.</li>
    <li> Requires long charge time, otherwise ONLY for very short curly or kinky hair.</li>
    <li> Great device, remains to be seen how long the battery lasts. Would love one that took AA&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I love it! I like keeping my hair short and it works great for that--just like the name says. It is super easy to use--just run it back and forth over your head like a comb and this little gadget does the rest. I used to have trouble trimming my hair line in the back with a clipper because I couldn&#x27;t see what I was doing. No worries with this device; I just put it on the shortest setting and sweep it in a twisting motion from the base of my neck up to the hairline and out.  I get a perfect cut every time.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, there are a few things I&#x27;ve learned about this product.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say you can leave the unit plugged in without worrying about overcharging it. I recommend leaving it plugged in. The charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to do two haircuts (I learned the hard way) so it&#x27;s best to have a full charge each time.&lt;br /&gt;The unit cannot be run on AC power.  Plugging in the charging cord locks the power button so it cannot be turned on while charging.&lt;br /&gt;The numbers on the adjustment wheel are very small and I have to wear my readers to see them.&lt;br /&gt;This thing doesn&#x27;t cut off a length of hair like a clipper does. Rather it &amp;#34;nibbles&amp;#34; at your hair resulting in a lot of &amp;#34;hair dust&amp;#34; that can clog the cutting head rather quickly. Every few strokes I have to shake the hair out of the plastic length guide. The instructions say you can rinse it clean under running water. But I&#x27;m old school and haven&#x27;t yet dared put this electric device in water.&lt;br /&gt;Because of that cutting action you will want to use this product frequently--once a week or once every two weeks. If you try to cut too much hair with it (say 1/4 inch or more) it will very quickly get bogged down.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; attachment that comes with it. Maybe I&#x27;ll get a friend to try that.&lt;br /&gt;The build feels OK.  Not great, not bad. Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m going to break the plastic length guide when I remove it for cleaning.  I&#x27;m curious to see how the whole things stand up to frequent use.</li>
    <li> I hope this last as long as the razor I own. (10 years!)</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic machine.  It cut my hair precisely the very first time I used it.  I cut my hair every three days or so and every time I use the Clipper I am delighted by the results.  I will never go back to a salon for haircuts (thereby saving a fortune over time - price of haircut, tip, gas to drive to the salon and time spent).  If you read the brief instruction book that comes with the Clipper, you won&#x27;t get balded like some of these reviewers did (because they didn&#x27;t read the instructions).  The Clipper comes with the balding comb affixed; so if you don&#x27;t want balding, you must change the comb before proceeding.  Not a big deal at all; some people make everything a big deal because they are in a hurry.  This Remington is a quality Clipper, easy to use and does EXACTLY what Remington says it will do.  I love it !  No complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Now, every week I am able to \\&quot;short-cut\\&quot; my balding hair and my beard within 5 minutes. Yes...I must take a shower afterwards, but that was my routine anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the \\&quot;bald\\&quot; blade, I dial it down to \\&quot;1\\&quot; and run the unit front to back and back to front and side to side. Then I run it over my cheeks and chin, moving it to different angles so that it does not cut too deep on certain areas. Bingo, I am done in a few minutes and my cut is even and very, very short!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave it connected to the charger and you will be ready to cut always. (no worry about over charging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this \\&quot;Short-Cut\\&quot; Remington and you will be happy, wealthy, short-cut and wise!</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I&#x27;ve used for cutting my own hair very short. The adjustable settings are good. I like how you can cut back and forth with the clippers.  You can also rinse the clippers with water after each use.  I do find it not perfect with cutting the along side of head or along sideburns where it does not cut as even. You do need to watch for uneven cutting since the blade is curved. Overall, very happy with the clippers.</li>
    <li> I have the Remington clipper for 4 weeks and I have used it about 6 times.  So far,  it has exceeded my expectations it terms of its design, capability, ease of use, quality of the cut and battery life.  A great innovation and I am very happy to have it.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one. The first one worked great but the battery took a dive after about a year. The warranty is 2 years but I don&#x27;t keep receipts so that&#x27;s why I got another set. I did keep the receipt for these tho. They do work pretty dang good, I just hope the battery issue dont come up again. Will see. Update, the battery went to crap again and about the receipt, lost it.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product and I recommend it.  I had my previous one for 3-4 years and though the battery life on the last one dried up pretty fast, the dual direction and cordless function is better than any normal clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this one is holding up battery life. The last one still worked but required me to plan ahead and charge it immediately before each use.  I ended up dropping it a few times and the casing was somewhat misaligned which, coupled with the battery, warranted a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its worth purchasing for the ease of use.  The dual direction function allows you to get it done quickly without worry that you missed spots.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does a great job.Very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;i would reccomend  this clipper to all my friends with short hair.</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd Remiington Short Cut clipper. The first one died in less than a year. The charging light went off and the clipper quit working. I contacted Remington and they shipped out a new one and I sent the dead one back. Shipping both ways was free. After less than a year same thing happened, the charging light went off and the clipper quit working again. I read a few reviews here on Amazon and found someone had opened up the unit and found it caked with oil and hair cuttings. He said once he cleaned it out it ran like new [except I think it was ruined from ripping open the casing].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With nothing to loose I figured if grease and clippings could get in they can get out without tearing upon the unit. I ran the clippers under hot water for a few minutes at an angle not submersing the whole unit. I shook it out and when I turned it on it ran great. I am not sure if this is a real fix or if I just got lucky but I was able to cut my hair and charge it so I&#x27;ll keep cleaning it this way and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is the design could be better to keep gunk from getting inside. For me it does a good job on my short hair and it&#x27;s easy to use. If all it takes is to run it under hot water once a month than it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> A bit tricky to clean the hair from, but super portable and works well if you don&#x27;t need to take off much, otherwise it just takes more passes...and removing hair, but it works good with a full charge being just enough for a single haircut. I&#x27;m changing my review from 4- to 2-stars, as I only used it a dozen times, and took good care of it.  UPDATE: 10/19/15 The motor appears to have seized. Power button just makes red light stay on, no noise, full charge. I&#x27;ve removed and cleaned blades, but still nothing.</li>
    <li> I have used this for more than a year and find it works well as I have short hair all over my head.</li>
    <li> Extremely easy to use clippers. If the batteries would last longer or were replacable, Iwoul have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these and love the way they perform but both of them started to lose power after 2-3 minutes even when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is good but the quality is poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If youy dont mind spending $30 for about 6 months use, then its fine. Otherwise pass.</li>
    <li> I like to keep my hair short and have been using regular clippers to cut it, But these clippers are fantastic, it&#x27;s just like combing your hair to cut it. They are shaped to your head, which is much more useful to use than regular clippers with a flat blade, also they collect most of the hair they cut, I was expecting hair all over the place like my old clippers but was suprised to see they were clean and easy to use. You have to shake the hair out of the clippers after each pass otherwise they stop cutting, but other than that excellent! easy to adjust the cutting height with the thumb wheel on the front. good for keeping your hair short, but struggle to cut if you let it get to long between cuts.</li>
    <li> I ended up buying this clipper directly from Remington because of the battery complaints noted on Amazon. Remington assured me if I bought their latest model, the batteries would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve given myself three haircuts with one battery charge. One cut was pretty serious hair removal and two were just touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy except for these small issues.&lt;br /&gt;If you tap the unit on your hand to knock some hair out of it, be sure to check the setting as a slight amount of tapping will cause a setting change. I was giving myself a \\&quot;two\\&quot; and tapped it on my hand. The stetting changed and I ended giving myself a 1 1/2.&lt;br /&gt;Also... It&#x27;s curved, so it requires some creativity to get the same length on the flatter sides of your head, but it works well with a few extra passes in different directions.&lt;br /&gt;I like it so far.</li>
    <li> The Remington clipper worked OK for a few months, and then charging/battery problems began. First, the blue charging light did not come on when I plugged it in, but the clipper still worked...for a while, then it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all. You think since it has a charger, it would still work. Oh no! The clever engineers behind this clipper designed it so it doesn&#x27;t to not work when it is plugged in. What a stupid concept. That was a surprise to me when I bought it, so be aware of that limitation. Thus, what I have now has the functionality of a paperweight.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a Philips Norelco QC5530 and it is worlds better - in design, flexibility of use, and the quality of the construction (lithium battery and it operates in both cordless and corded mode). And its&#x27; only 5 bucks more at Amazon. [[ASIN:B004QWVY8A Philips Norelco QC5530 Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper]] Take my word on it and don&#x27;t waste your money on this Remington clipper..... unless you need a paperweight</li>
    <li> Battery life on this sucks.  After a full charge, it works great for about one minute.  Then, it sounds like it&#x27;s about to die and makes me feel like it will stop before my haircut is done.  It keeps going for about another 5 minutes, then dies.  Package description claims it goes for four hair cuts, not true.  I don&#x27;t understand why this doesn&#x27;t work on A/C? If this thing would work while plugged in, like every shaver I have ever owned, it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! It&#x27;s way faster than traditional clippers and way shorter! Not too god for facial hair though... Yup</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair short (1/8) with almost no effort. I recommend it for anyone who wants short but not shaved !</li>
    <li> I basically got tired of popping $12-16 bucks a haircut, not including a tip, and went shopping for help. Bottom line for this product is that I love this hair clipper. I&#x27;ve used it four times, as of 3-21-2015, and it easily gives me the #2 clearance cut I want on my near bald head. It&#x27;s easy to clean and comes with a lubricating solution. I will keep Amazon to it&#x27;s advertised 2-year warranty if need be. The other day I walked past a barber shop that advertised haircuts for seniors(I&#x27;m 70) @ $14.00----not to mention a tip. I use the clipper every 2-3 weeks and it&#x27;s already paid for itself three haircuts ago and saved me TIME---- time to get to a barber shop/sit through the quick haircut/and be on my way.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this to cut his own hair for years.  This one replaced the old one that became difficult to charge.  The first one provided many hair cuts for about a year and a half.</li>
    <li> I haven t had it long time. used it 3x so far . I cut hair low as can bald almost. it works like comb does pretty good.but the clipper part you slide out doesn t work good. it pulls not cuts hair so I still have to use my old clippers to trim behind my ears and sideburn area. because of shape of it .doesn t work goon on flat spots.  also my neck I have use old clippers. it is good for doing most of my head tho.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to be able to keep my hair cut on a weekly basis.  I can cut my hair all by myself without having to involve anyone else.  I just bend over my utility sink and go at it.  Takes about two minutes for the blades to no longer have anything to cut.</li>
    <li> A great gadget, just needs some practice and getting used to it.  I use my over the bathroom sink with the DRAIN CLOSED.  When finished I use a damp sponge and rinse the sponge in the CLEAN toilet bowl and then flush.  Lastly I do a good cleanup job of the sink and use the little brush tool to remove any remaining hair from my haircut tool.  It works very well and is reasonably priced.</li>
