      <li>The hubby and I were both pleased.</li>
      <li>Thanks for offering a great deal on this product.  </li>
      <li>My all time favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>One of the reasons I love Amazon.</li>
      <li>I bought this cologne as a present for my husband&#x27;s best friend.  </li>
      <li>I love the way the house smells in the morning with my husband and boys.</li>
      <li>I would say its his favorite now .</li>
      <li>these, Fierce, Diesel, and Jeal Paul receive the most compliments&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My husband and I got this cologne for our 15 year old grandson for Christmas, it was on his list and was so happy to get it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great young guy scent.</li>
      <li>Super sexy.  </li>
      <li>Close up that scent is too strong and there&#x27;s a slight scent that isn&#x27;t very pleasant..</li>
      <li>/&gt;D&amp;G Light Blue&lt;br /&gt;Jean</li>
      <li>This is a ok cologne the smell is too familiar and is not that strong and is small bottle considering that if you spray alot of cologne comes out, good for begginers</li>
      <li>I always make sure I order more of this cologne when I start running low.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping too.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s his new favorite now .</li>
      <li>This scent is HOT!  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 18year old son and he has received many compliments,  </li>
      <li>It came super quick and was the real deal.</li>
      <li>What I&#x27;ve learned from buying colognes is that it is worth spending a little bit more for a much better product.</li>
      <li>There are better colognes than this one for just a few more bucks.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>and he loves it as much as I do!  </li>
      <li>Overall satisfied.</li>
      <li>This is the Cologne that my boyfriend first wore when I met him and two years later I still love it.</li>
      <li>I smelled those few drops and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Woodsy, masculine, with a hint of clean citrus.</li>
      <li>It had a cap that didn&#x27;t fit and the sprayer pops off (and thanksfully pops back on).  </li>
      <li>He really likes it also.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>My son really loves this cologne, and in a spray version is a bonus</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>this scent is perfect for any season and with only a few sprays it&#x27;ll last the whole day.</li>
      <li>so I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a new cologne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not strong on the nose but still packs a scent that women love.</li>
      <li>Very nice smell for casual occasions like going to get a coffee.</li>
      <li>at least I didn&#x27;t spend the original price in the store!</li>
      <li>This was a present for my 22 year old son, recommended by his girlfriend.</li>
      <li>My fiancé had a tiny bottle with a few drops left and this isn&#x27;t available in Ecuador.  </li>

<li> It smells masculine, unlike other Hollister&#x27;s products.  </li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as one would wish it to.</li>
<li> My wife loves it, but it doesn&#x27;t have a long lasting scent.</li>
<li> Last a long time.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t surprised to see the package arrive only a few days after I ordered it.</li>
<li> It has a wood scent that from a distance isn&#x27;t too bad, but isn&#x27;t amazing either.</li>
<li> I only gave it 4 stars due to the price.</li>
<li> I paid $44 or so after shipping, not sure what that was about since I don&#x27;t have a hollister near by I cannot compare</li>
<li> I get a compliment from almost everybody I walk by, keep in mind that it takes a few sprays for it to last all day.</li>
<li> The box was slightly beaten up (opened) and the bottom read $29.99 retail or something like that.</li>
<li> The scent usually stays on for 1 hour until the scent becomes minimal, but thats just me</li>
<li> but I know it ended up being a few $ cheaper than the HCO website.</li>
<li> I was looking for a cologne for everyday use and my gf suggested I get this after she smelled it at the mall.</li>
<li> , perhaps it&#x27;s just with me, but the smell of this cologe gave me a pretty bad headache...</li>
<li> This is really just a bad cologne in all ways.</li>
<li> I have ordered this for my son in the past.  </li>
<li> Amazon usually scores!  </li>
<li> /&gt;Overall, it smells mediocre.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a bit expensive</li>
<li> However, the shipper I used sent me an awful bottle.  </li>
<li> HORRIBLE price..  </li>

    <li> This is the only cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned that has given me a headache..and I&#x27;ve owned several different colognes before.&lt;br /&gt;I received this one as a gift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently own&lt;br /&gt;Abercrombie Fierce&lt;br /&gt;D&amp;G Light Blue&lt;br /&gt;Jean Paul&lt;br /&gt;Fahrenheit (Dior)&lt;br /&gt;Fuel for Life (Diesel)&lt;br /&gt;Versace Eau de Toilette&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;D&amp;G Pour Homme&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of these, Fierce, Diesel, and Jeal Paul receive the most compliments&lt;br /&gt;I dont know what it is, perhaps it&#x27;s just with me, but the smell of this cologe gave me a pretty bad headache...because the smell is kind of piercing and stingy...&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it smells mediocre.

    <li> I always look for the cheapest price on items bought through the internet.  Amazon usually scores!  This scent is wonderful on my son.  Quick shipping too.  thanks.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cologne for everyday use and my gf suggested I get this after she smelled it at the mall. Nice cologne with a not too strong scent.</li>

    <li> Awesome cologne..  HORRIBLE price..  the REGULAR price at hollister is 38.00 for the 1.7 ml,  and 30.00 for the 1.0 ml...</li>
    <li> I love Hollister&#x27;s Jake.  It&#x27;s the only Hollister product (including clothing) that I use.  It smells masculine, unlike other Hollister&#x27;s products.  However, the shipper I used sent me an awful bottle.  It had a cap that didn&#x27;t fit and the sprayer pops off (and thanksfully pops back on).  I wish I knew their name, because I would say, don&#x27;t use _____ in the future.</li>
    <li> This scent is HOT!  That&#x27;s all I can say.  I give it 5 stars.  I love the way the house smells in the morning with my husband and boys.</li>
    <li> I LOOOOVVVE this cologne.  Smells sooo good.  I am sooo thankful Amazon carries it even though Hollister doesn&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore.  Of all the colognes I&#x27;ve ever smelled, this one is by far the best.  Super sexy.  My husband loves it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 18year old son and he has received many compliments,  it&#x27;s a great young guy scent. I only gave it 4 stars due to the price. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Smells great, has a spray piece so you don&#x27;t have to pour it out , 5/5 would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I always make sure I order more of this cologne when I start running low. Please don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> came quick and smells great. I was super impressed with the packaging and the care that went into it to make sure i got a whole product.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent. My husband always gets compliments when he wears it.</li>
    <li> This cologne is the only one I will wear. It&#x27;s not strong on the nose but still packs a scent that women love.</li>
    <li> Great item!  It was a gift and the recipient was   very happy with it!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite cologne. Gets me complements everywhere I go. even grandmas dig this stuff. they ask what it is so they could get one for their grandson. haha. this scent is perfect for any season and with only a few sprays it&#x27;ll last the whole day. I forget I&#x27;m wearing this stuff until I get asked about it. it&#x27;s a bit expensive but you get the more bang for the buck so I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a new cologne.</li>
    <li> My fiancé had a tiny bottle with a few drops left and this isn&#x27;t available in Ecuador.  I smelled those few drops and loved it.  So I got it for him and he loves it as much as I do!  Very sexy, manly...  yum!</li>
    <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t last long. The scent usually stays on for 1 hour until the scent becomes minimal, but thats just me</li>

    <li> Smells great but seems to be a diluted scent and wears off fast</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne for my husband as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; present. (Yes, we do that mushy kind of stuff). I wasn&#x27;t surprised to see the package arrive only a few days after I ordered it. One of the reasons I love Amazon. The box was in great condition, and the scent itself is amazing! Woodsy, masculine, with a hint of clean citrus. The hubby and I were both pleased. I would recommend this product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is really just a bad cologne in all ways. It has a wood scent that from a distance isn&#x27;t too bad, but isn&#x27;t amazing either. Close up that scent is too strong and there&#x27;s a slight scent that isn&#x27;t very pleasant.. like rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell for casual occasions like going to get a coffee. My wife loves it, but it doesn&#x27;t have a long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent smelling cologne, has became my every day wear steady compliments and becomes a conversation piece</li>

    <li> This was a present for my 22 year old son, recommended by his girlfriend. He really likes it also. Last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the Cologne that my boyfriend first wore when I met him and two years later I still love it. It came super quick and was the real deal.</li>
    <li> I only bought this as a gift. I don&#x27;t like perfumes or colognes. They often leave me with burning eyes and sneezing.</li>
    <li> My son love this cologne !! It&#x27;s his new favorite now . His girlfriend loved it also . I would say its his favorite now . Thanks</li>
    <li> Overall satisfied. The box was slightly beaten up (opened) and the bottom read $29.99 retail or something like that. I paid $44 or so after shipping, not sure what that was about since I don&#x27;t have a hollister near by I cannot compare but I know it ended up being a few $ cheaper than the HCO website.</li>
    <li> Really nice smelling cologne but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as one would wish it to. Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> My husband and I got this cologne for our 15 year old grandson for Christmas, it was on his list and was so happy to get it. It smells wonderful!</li>
