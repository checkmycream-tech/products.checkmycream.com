      <li>THIS PRODUCT DOES WORK AMAZINGLY...</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a good 7+ years now, and fell in love the 1st time I used it...</li>
      <li>Some say it does not help thme to each their own</li>
      <li>It has not irritated my skin, no break outs, and feels nice going on.  </li>
      <li>For the price it does a nice job of filling the wrinkles with nothing showing thru.</li>
      <li>and was excited that it was sold at a great price...</li>
      <li>I promised myself, to be fair, that I would try this before writing a review as I have used the Daily Anti-Wrinkle for a couple years and have been very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Phenomenal product, great price, quick turnaround tine, reliable seller.</li>
      <li>Easy Transaction!</li>
      <li>excellent product that gets the job done as no other L&amp;#34;Oreal collagen filler does.</li>
      <li>Although it is not a miracle coverup for deeper lines (between eyes), it is a nice additional  cream to easily wear under makeup.</li>
      <li>I count myself lucky and thankful for good genes.</li>
      <li>if the contents are even effective anymore, just has a strong rancid \\&quot;old\\&quot; smell.</li>
      <li>and I sincerely hope they haven&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the smoothness</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many months, hoping it might eventually make a difference.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I used to use Wexler&#x27;s No Injection Line Filler and that stuff was MAGIC...</li>
      <li>i usually love this product from loreal.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>i love this product.</li>
      <li>I normally love this product but this latest delivery was rancid.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and it works so well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the product and indicate to all people who like to treat the skin.</li>
      <li>Sincerely, Arlene Mary Jones, Brookings, Oregon.</li>
      <li>I love this product it works so well.  </li>
      <li>It does not surprise me, as with L&#x27;Oreal products I am always pleased and can count on them.  </li>
      <li>Product is OK.  </li>
      <li>Glad to see it&#x27;s so easy to find on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and super inexpensive to others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I had always had very full lips, but found that they had shrunk with age.</li>
      <li>but there are certainly better creams available that can  prevent as well as correct the signs of aging.</li>
      <li>but i sooooo like my face right now !!</li>
      <li>I like the tube and the pointed applicator which makes it so easy to run across the lines.  </li>
      <li>I was sceptical if this product would work, so when I first got it i applied the filler on one side of the face, just put it nicely in the creases of your wrinkles around your mouth/ lip lines forehead</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it, and you can also put it on top of your foundation for a touch up, it soaks in nicely.  </li>
      <li>This product says it helps with fine lines and wrinkles, but in fine print on the box.</li>
      <li>No wonder it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>Follow responses to questions from the satisfaction survey, 4 stars because I chose to use some time and got very good results in the eye area and my dark circles diminished.</li>
      <li>if in the long run it works to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; or delay the onset of deeper lines that&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>What I love about the product is the fine tip that lets you squeeze out just a bit at a time in exactly the right place.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this particular item in our small town of Brooking, Oregon, &amp; I was sooo very happy I was able to Purchase it from Amazon....</li>
      <li>apparently it&#x27;s been discontinued like so many things I come to love.</li>
      <li>Although I have excellent skin, at my age [late 60s]</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good size cream cause it can last awhile.</li>
      <li>What she received didn&#x27;t smell good and was semi solid.</li>
      <li>Would never buy if at full retail.</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say about this stuff is that it&#x27;s the rare product that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>my face at the next day is amazing</li>
      <li>Gets rid of the under eye and laugh lines.  </li>
      <li>So, I think it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
      <li>Price was right.  </li>
      <li>The price is right.</li>
      <li>For a gentle, sensitive skin cleanin Herbalism by lush.com is amazing, if you have acne prone skin /teenage or middle age you will love these products together with the collagen wrinkle filler treatment.</li>
      <li>Needs very Much Improvement.</li>
      <li>Not so sure about deep wrinkles.</li>
      <li>The product was exactly as described on the website.</li>
      <li>The tube (container) split the first time it was touched.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles and I am lucky with decent skin.</li>
      <li>The RevitaLift is in a red tube and its consistency is such that it easily comes out; but the best part is that is really diminishes the wrinkles and creases and jowl lines that run from each side of your nose past the sides of your mouth to you chin.</li>
      <li>I purchase the product based on the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand all these positive reviews.</li>
      <li>I have  used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
      <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Filler Wrinkle Treatment comes out as a white stream but easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
      <li>Dont&#x27; comprehend how a large Company like L&#x27;Oreal can put products like this on the market?  </li>
      <li>Overall though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very useful for fine lines which was what I had purchased it for, I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles yet and thought this product might smooth out some of the tiny creases around my eyes</li>
      <li>This product is definitely a keep together with my Dream Creme/Vanishing Creme (amazing moisturizer and acne scars, red blemish deminisher) by Lush.com</li>
      <li>I never saw much improvement.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t really do much to correct anything.</li>
      <li>and they sent 3 tubes of this) and am very dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>do you know what a REAL wrinkle is?  </li>
      <li>Wish I would have found this product when in my 30th, think it really could have helped and make a difference.  </li>
      <li>also tell the user to read directions carefully before using, and to focus,in applying, on your most pronounced worrisome wrinkles (forehead wrinkles, crow&#x27;s feet, laughter lines etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really was hoping for this to work</li>
      <li>really works and it is reasonably priced</li>
      <li>Really a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I thought L&#x27;Oreal Paris was supposed to be a higher-end product than most, but alas it isn&#x27;t any better than what I find in the dollar store.</li>
      <li>This, however, is more expensive, so I thought it might be better.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think this has been discontinued or is not widely marketed so it is hard to find, it is a must for stubborn lines, just a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Collegen Filler Wrinkle Treatment for several years. Although I have excellent skin, at my age [late 60s] I was beginning to shw a few laugh lines and forehead lines. What I love about the product is the fine tip that lets you squeeze out just a bit at a time in exactly the right place.</li>
    <li> This makes an amazing difference in my wrinkles and it was only a few days before very noticeable results! Highly recommend and will be buying from again...</li>
    <li> Dont&#x27; comprehend how a large Company like L&#x27;Oreal can put products like this on the market?  They lie, thats how come.  None of these anti-aging products work, from foundations (makeup)moisterizers (day and night cremes).  I&#x27;ve been around makeup my entire life and have spent a fortune on preventing those unGodly wrinkles and believe me, NOTHING WORKS except botox.  If they actually came up with just one product that worked - all the other lines would be out of business for sure.  People that give this product 5 or 4 STARS, either are completely out of thier minds or totally blind.  And these 26 to 35 yr old gals that give it a 5 STAR - I ask you, do you know what a REAL wrinkle is?  Wrinkles are lines in the forehead, upper lip, cheeks, eyes and neck and they are there 24 hrs. a day. Mine never went away and I used this product faithfully for 3 weeks, night and daytime.  The product is worthless, ladies DO NO PURCHASED THIS WRINKLE collagen filler.</li>
    <li> I was Extremely happy with my Amazon.com purchace...The service was great...The Item I ordered arrived on time...It was packaged perfectly..I couldn&#x27;t find this particular item in our small town of Brooking, Oregon, &amp; I was sooo very happy I was able to Purchase it from Amazon....And it was only 1/4 of the price I paid before...Thank you Amazon, I will B back...Sincerely, Arlene Mary Jones, Brookings, Oregon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m turning 50 in a few weeks.... I count myself lucky and thankful for good genes. Tiny creases around the eyes and laugh lines don&#x27;t bother me, but why wait before they become deep wrinkles? I started using this product over a week ago. My skin is noticeably softer and clearer. Try this; you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Product is OK.  Really a moisturizer.  Does nothing for \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot;.  Price was right.  Would never buy if at full retail.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product, great price, quick turnaround tine, reliable seller. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> i love this product. i uses before i got to sleep and my face at the next day is amazing i recommended 100%</li>
    <li> The only good thing I can say about this stuff is that it&#x27;s the rare product that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It has, however, also had no discernible effect on the lines on my face.</li>
    <li> reduces appearance of wrinkles</li>
    <li> This stuff is very good however, apparently it&#x27;s been discontinued like so many things I come to love. Would buy it again if I could find it.</li>
    <li> i usually love this product from loreal. and was excited that it was sold at a great price...but this will be a lesson on getting what you pay for! you can immediately tell this product was an older expired version product just on the smell that comes with cosmetic items that have been sitting on a shelf for a long time. (i have a legit version of it that has a pleasant smell). i tried to look for an expiration or ANY date on the box but couldn&#x27;t find it. the box alone should have been a red flag as i think it&#x27;s an older box. so i&#x27;m not sure if the contents are even effective anymore, just has a strong rancid \\&quot;old\\&quot; smell. but the annoying smell of the product will be a constant reminder that i went for a cheap price and not quality.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it works so well.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as described on the website. I previously purchased this item while traveling in Europe, but it was way overpriced. I am happy to have found it on Amazon at less than a third of the cost I previously paid.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years  fills in those tiny lines around your eyes makes you feel younger without having the exspense of botox Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a good 7+ years now, and fell in love the 1st time I used it... THIS PRODUCT DOES WORK AMAZINGLY...The trick is to press this on, not rub maybe thats what the woman who said it doesn&#x27;t work was doing wrong... There is no way this product didn&#x27;t work, its fool proof... Im 44 and people NEVER believe me... (They have discontinued this product but its not for lack of demand, its because they&#x27;ve got to stay competitive, hence the coke disaster yrs back).. You can still find this on Amazon and Ebay, and oddly BB&amp;Beyond.</li>
    <li> Great product and I would purchase again.  The price is right.</li>
    <li> WoW!  A treatment that actually works!  It does not surprise me, as with L&#x27;Oreal products I am always pleased and can count on them.  Within a minute after application I look 15 years younger, and it lasts up to 6 hours before needing a touchup.  I am VERY happy with this product and will continue to buy and use it.  I noticed that even when I am not using it my skin is getting tighter and I use night and day creams as well.</li>
    <li> The price is good, but i hv got one good and one leaking staffs. They should checked products before they packed.</li>
    <li> I had ordered the L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Daily Anti-Wrinkle Concentrate, 1-Fluid Ounce and the seller sent this by mistake. I promised myself, to be fair, that I would try this before writing a review as I have used the Daily Anti-Wrinkle for a couple years and have been very happy with it. Never used this Concentrate before. This, however, is more expensive, so I thought it might be better.  I WAS WRONG!  This cannot compare to the RevitaLift Daily Anti-Wrinkle Concentrate and I would not buy this again, nor keep it if the seller sent it to me mistakenly. It does not diminish the wrinkles nor &amp;#34;fill-in&amp;#34; the creases in my face or neck half as well. I would never use it again. I have given it months to work (ordered 3 tubes of RevitaLift and they sent 3 tubes of this) and am very dissatisfied. Also, it is very, very difficult to get out of the tube...it&#x27;s too thick, I guess, to come out easily.  The RevitaLift is in a red tube and its consistency is such that it easily comes out; but the best part is that is really diminishes the wrinkles and creases and jowl lines that run from each side of your nose past the sides of your mouth to you chin. At least for me, it does. I will never settle for anything less than the L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Daily Anti-Wrinkle Concentrate, 1-Fluid Ounce.</li>
    <li> Loved this items.  Would order again when required.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical if this product would work, so when I first got it i applied the filler on one side of the face, just put it nicely in the creases of your wrinkles around your mouth/ lip lines forehead etc, and you will see how it clearly deminishes the appearance of your wrinkles. Wish I would have found this product when in my 30th, think it really could have helped and make a difference.  The product is also very affordable,at least here on Amazon, have not checked it out in stores yet, and you need only a very very small amount of it, I expect this to last several month.  Highly recommend it, and you can also put it on top of your foundation for a touch up, it soaks in nicely.  This product is definitely a keep together with my Dream Creme/Vanishing Creme (amazing moisturizer and acne scars, red blemish deminisher) by Lush.com that is also sold here on amazon. For a gentle, sensitive skin cleanin Herbalism by lush.com is amazing, if you have acne prone skin /teenage or middle age you will love these products together with the collagen wrinkle filler treatment.</li>
    <li> The Price is great, the product is awesome and the quality is excellent!  Thank you!  Will buy again!  Easy Transaction!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find any difference afterr using it.</li>
    <li> The businessman is to show the pictures of the amazon online is anti-wrinkle new products, and delivery of the products to hand is old anti-wrinkle inventory goods, everything inside is the same, but the outer packing is different, I thought I was bought new product</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s just another false statement of l &#x27;orleal.  Tried half tube, no effect at all.  Don&#x27;t recommend to buy!</li>
    <li> This product is probably best for people with fine wrinkles. I&#x27;m 21, and have very few wrinkles but the ones that were there disappeared when I used this cream. Not so sure about deep wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The tube (container) split the first time it was touched.  Would not buy from this reseller again.  Must be an old product.</li>
    <li> So disappointed this is discontinued!</li>
    <li> This product is hard to buy in the United States for some reason.  However, you can purchase it in the UK&lt;br /&gt;It really works and it is reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I applied the cream in the evening and with 20 minutes my skin above my lips starting swelling.  I immediately took a Benadryl and washed my face.  I then applied Benadryl cream to the area.  The swelling did not subside until 11:00 am the following day.  I would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Could this possible have been expired?&lt;br /&gt;jb</li>
    <li> Loreal should be ashamed they stopped making this product, it is a miracle worker. I used for years and look 10 years younger.</li>
    <li> I never saw much improvement.</li>
    <li> This product fills in the deep laugh lines around the mouth area. Being a little elderly, this wrinkle treatment does it for me.</li>
    <li> It works okay but this tube smelled like any lotion type of product smells when it get old.  It was disappointing.</li>
    <li> omg this thing is AMAZING seriously. ill be honest with you all. ive just turned 20 few months ago and ive started seeing some wrinkles appearing around my eyes and the area around my mouth looks kinda strange. i have inherited dark circles .. and this thing really firms my whoooooooooole entire face seriously i dunno and im not sure what this thing is doing but i sooooo like my face right now !! ive been using it for a few weeks now . i repeat.. this thing is amaaaaazing !!!</li>
    <li> Very good!  The product is powerfull.&lt;br /&gt;I bought for a gift and the person loverd it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> I normally love this product but this latest delivery was rancid.  I&#x27;d already thrown away the packaging by the time I realized it was bad, so I was unable to check to see if there was an expiration date on the box or not.  It just smells really bad.</li>
    <li> This product says it helps with fine lines and wrinkles, but in fine print on the box. It says that it doesn&#x27;t work for wrinkles.  I bought two of them and did not write this until I used this product for 2 months. I saw no improvement what-so-ever. No wonder it was so cheap. I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but wanted to stop the small ones that have started showing up since I turned 41. Didn&#x27;t work. I hope this helps anyone who is also looking for something to keep those lines at bay. This won&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> It smell terriable,I don&#x27;t like this fragrance,like human manufacture! It didn&#x27;t like I brough form other country,I suspect it original one or OEM one.</li>
    <li> Used this before, works well.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Filler Wrinkle Treatment comes out as a white stream but easily absorbs into the skin. However, it tends to leave a dry residue behind on the skins surface that can flake off if your skin happens to not be moisturized afterwards. It&#x27;s a good size cream cause it can last awhile. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for the past two months and there&#x27;s still plenty of product left, though that may also depend on how much of it one tends to use. Overall though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very useful for fine lines which was what I had purchased it for, I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles yet and thought this product might smooth out some of the tiny creases around my eyes but it didn&#x27;t really do much to correct anything. I do think that it may have help with preventing the formation of new lines though but there are certainly better creams available that can  prevent as well as correct the signs of aging. I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it again based on it drying out my skin and not having much effect but based on its size, its affordable price and the fact that it does seem to somewhat prevent future skin damage I&#x27;m fairly content with having purchased it.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works so well.  Very hard to get anymore.  Wish they would bring it back</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all these positive reviews. I have used this product for many months, hoping it might eventually make a difference. I&#x27;ve used it on deep wrinkles, barely-there wrinkles, and everything in between. No effect at all. Nada. Nothing. I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money. No wonder the manufacturer has discontinued this product. :-( Save your money.</li>
    <li> It was a cheap imitation.  Runny and smelled very bad!!  It WAS NOT the product I buy in the stores</li>
    <li> Gets rid of the under eye and laugh lines.  I use it daily and definitely thinks it works.</li>
    <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Filler for years and I can only say two very positive words regarding this product...IT WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Bennett</li>
    <li> Follow responses to questions from the satisfaction survey, 4 stars because I chose to use some time and got very good results in the eye area and my dark circles diminished. I&#x27;m enjoying the product and indicate to all people who like to treat the skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I have always had very deep frown lines between my eyebrows, as early as in my 30&#x27;s. Then I started to use this product daily every morning before moisturizer. Even now, at age 57, my from lines are less deep in appearance since they were many years ago. I was super sad when the product was discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal, but now I have found it at Amazon! I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about an expiration date. That is just required by law - but this isn&#x27;t food. I am going to take a chance that it is still an awesome product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped - am trying different products to fill a scar on my nose (from cancer) - product wasn&#x27;t thick enough -</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, I&#x27;m disappointed L&#x27;Oreal discontinued production and the only place I can find it is Amazon or other distributors.  It works well for my skin and skin type.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and super inexpensive to others I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles and I am lucky with decent skin. My problem is that I scowl naturally all the time- even in my sleep and have a huge, very deep, line between my brows, even when I am actively trying to relax my forehead. Anyway, I used to use Wexler&#x27;s No Injection Line Filler and that stuff was MAGIC...both instant results and lasting results with repeated use. For whatever reason, some evil person decided to discontinue it, and I am on the hunt to find its replacement. THUS, the Wexler product has become the baseline, that I judge everything against. This L&#x27;Oreal stuff definitely doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Wexler, but I do see a difference. I am not sure that I am using it for its intended use, but for my specific need, it is \\&quot;just ok\\&quot;. I will continue using it and may even order it again if I can&#x27;t find something else, but I will continue looking.</li>
    <li> I purchase the product based on the positive reviews. I love the smell and the smoothness but it didnt do anything for my wrinkles.  I really was hoping for this to work but it just didnt for me. So I&#x27;m off to search for other products to help with the newly forming wrinkles I&#x27;m developing...</li>
    <li> I just turned 41 and started getting some lines under my eyes and creases on the eyelid.  This cream works wonders, it completely fills them in, in seconds.  I was shocked at the result--on the downside you do need to run it along the cheeks too or it looks like you have puffy eyes, the product probably wouldn&#x27;t be good to use if you have noticeable bags under your eyes for this reason.  I use it with the L&#x27;oreal collagen filler day/night and both together have made a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was 19 and I am now 28. So almost ten years! I get comments all the time that I look like I&#x27;m still in high school. I&#x27;m not sure if they stopped making this product and I sincerely hope they haven&#x27;t. I just can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores anymore. This makes your skin so soft and vibrant. Not to mention I have no wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The giant cosmetics firlm L&#x27;Oreal claims this collagen filler will,with regular use, plump and visibly smooth wrinkle creases while it diffuses and fills in the depth and length of facial lines. In short, they are advertising it as an anti-aging treatment that will deliver anti-wrinkle action in women over 30. The makers claim that the cream&#x27;s silicone enriched formula immediately smoothes the appearance of wrinkles on the skin surface.&lt;br /&gt;They add that the product also contains Collagen Biospheres that can inflate up to 9x in volume to help fill in wrinkle furrows; that the product is ideal for use day and night, in conjunction with Collagen Filler Eye, Collagen Skin Re-Modeller or Wrinkle De-Crease Day and Night.&lt;br /&gt;They also tell the user to read directions carefully before using, and to focus,in applying, on your most pronounced worrisome wrinkles (forehead wrinkles, crow&#x27;s feet, laughter lines etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I have used the product day and night faithfully for several weeks, and I see no improvement in my wrinkles, and believe me, I have them, deep ones.</li>
    <li> when i open this smell no good im not use it...i never buy this again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and from cvs.... ohh well bad for me this product</li>
    <li> The product I received was expired and had a terrible odor, like mildew. Apparently this product is discontinued and the old product is being sold as new. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how it works but it does diminish the 2 slight lines I&#x27;ve been starting to get across my forehead.  Granted, the lines are new and not too deep, but this stuff fills them in nicely and blends in pretty well with my skin once dried.  It does take a bit of blending if I&#x27;m not just hanging around the house.....then poof!  No more lines, I can&#x27;t see them at all!  I do touch it up once a day, or after a work out, but I don&#x27;t mind and if in the long run it works to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; or delay the onset of deeper lines that&#x27;s great.  It has not irritated my skin, no break outs, and feels nice going on.  I like the tube and the pointed applicator which makes it so easy to run across the lines.  And I don&#x27;t mind the slight fragrance which some others complained about.  It did tingle the first few times I used it, and I noticed that it makes me a bit more sensitive to sun exposure. (I ran it across an old scar and went out for a run and for the first time I can remember the scar got a little pink from the sun.) So, I think it&#x27;s worth a try If you remember to just be realistic, it&#x27;s not surgical or like Botox treatments. It&#x27;s a great price here on Amazon and I like the results I&#x27;m seeing so far.</li>
    <li> This product is very disappointing.  I thought L&#x27;Oreal Paris was supposed to be a higher-end product than most, but alas it isn&#x27;t any better than what I find in the dollar store.</li>
    <li> I received product opened up to use and the tube cracked all the way down side. Product was like water inside, very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this product and was sad to see it removed from their line. Hopefully when I run out again someone will be offering it again. I bought 4 of them, which should last at least 6 months.</li>
    <li> I Received Wrong and cheaper product. NOT  the type I ordered . Very disappointed about the service.</li>
    <li> I tried this product once as a duty-free airline product, and adored it. Then, I could never find it again in the stores. I never thought to look on Amazon until now, silly me. It still seems to work very well, although (alas) I&#x27;m older. I have used much more expensive items, with MUCH less result. The &amp;#34;shelf life&amp;#34; is a little concern, but for the price, it&#x27;s well worth it, even if slightly less effective.</li>
    <li> I have  used this product in the past and loved it. This product smelled so stale I could not use it.</li>
    <li> Although it is not a miracle coverup for deeper lines (between eyes), it is a nice additional  cream to easily wear under makeup.</li>
    <li> This is great for filling in lines and adding fullness. I had always had very full lips, but found that they had shrunk with age. I first bought this at my local CVS, and found after a week or so of conscientious use that my lips were regaining fullness. Now, I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Of course, I found it hard to find locally ever since. Glad to see it&#x27;s so easy to find on Amazon. Use morning and evening.</li>
    <li> this product does not fill your wrinkles. Needs very Much Improvement. L&#x27;Oreal should be ashamed of this product. All Lies !!!</li>
    <li> excellent product that gets the job done as no other L&amp;#34;Oreal collagen filler does.</li>
    <li> Used this for yrs. and hard to find in stores. For the price it does a nice job of filling the wrinkles with nothing showing thru.Of course it s not 100 recent but  enough to diminish and make a difference, After applying  make up I think my face wrinkles are much less noticeable.I am 75.</li>
    <li> This product did not do what it claimed on the label.  In fact, the result was very dry skin around the area I was treating.  Just the opposite of what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Good product at ecellent price</li>
    <li> Our faces are not manikins, we cant just plaster over wrinkles and expect them not to show! Collagen on sensitive skin also causes breakouts.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It&#x27;s been discontinued and you may get an old item like we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes this product and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore, so she purchased it here. What she received didn&#x27;t smell good and was semi solid. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this expired line, instead try their new RevitaLift Collagen Wrinkle Treatment.</li>
    <li> I dont leave home with out it.  Use this product evey morning and I like it a lot. Some say it does not help thme to each their own</li>
    <li> I have found this product does what it promices.  It is not as affective as a doctor&#x60;s proceedure, but quite good for over the counter.  Aparently, L&#x60;Oreal is now discontinuing this line.  I was fortunate to find it here at Amazon at half the price stores would charge!</li>
    <li> Did not trust the product</li>
    <li> I have used for a few weeks now and the only thing I have noticed is that it takes more makeup to cover up the filler and that my face is shiner.</li>
    <li> Use it with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Daily Serum - Perfect!</li>
