      <li>but so far so good</li>
      <li>Shipped super quick!</li>
      <li>And a good deal for starting out.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t got this item yet but already know I&#x27;ll love it and hope ya&#x27;ll do to thanks for reading.</li>
      <li>buti did my first tattoo withit and so far so good.</li>
      <li>but luckily I already had a tattoo gun.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t believe these lying losers its a great buy...</li>
      <li>it is well worth the money for a amature.</li>
      <li>overall the machine itself is a nice starter machine and its durable</li>
      <li>very well I love my tattoo machine but only thing is need better ink</li>
      <li>This product came quickly and is exactly as specified.</li>
      <li>Arrived pretty quickly though.</li>
      <li>It comes with everything to start tattooing right away.</li>
      <li>but the tattoo was not working right</li>
      <li>yet) the gun will run hot if not tuned right.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>the machine got a little hot but layed good lines for me.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t wait till my next order get here :)</li>
      <li>my advice would be to just save up five or ten dollars and get a better one....</li>
      <li>Is exactly as described and well packaged.</li>
      <li>and it wasnt hot at all</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good kit for you to start with...got my kit a few months ago, and gave myself a colored tat with it, and its just starting to fade now, so it could use some better ink...</li>
      <li>All though I am Satisfied with The product, its a cool start for Beginners, its cheap, small, Convenient-you get what You pay for...</li>
      <li>the inks are kinda low quality remember when you order this to order some more tips too.  </li>
      <li>got this and have used it a few times and it runs good, you do have to tune it a bit and get it to run the way you want it too.  </li>
      <li>I like this kit it works very well when set up right.</li>
      <li>Its what was shown so i am happy with what i got i would definitely encourage other people to order through them.</li>
      <li>So it came pretty quickly and i was very excited to start right up, I opened the kit and started assembling the machine, Come to find out it&#x27;s missing a bolt, 2 bolt tightners,grommets, ink cups and rubberbands!</li>
      <li>Nice little starter kit.</li>
      <li>Power supply wouldn&#x27;t work straight out of the box; the power cord seems intact, but the machine will not power on.  </li>
      <li>Ink is cheap and really tiny bottles.</li>
      <li>Well, we bought another kit and nothing really works in this one besides the paint and the practice skin.</li>
      <li>It over heard cuts on and off, and I haven&#x27;t even done any real Tatts with it yet.</li>
      <li>Simple to use and excited to try it out.</li>
      <li>this works and is good for practice but not really a good machine to use on real skin.</li>
      <li>it is a good kit for the money i think it should have included thermal transfer papern at least 1 to 5 sheets but other than that it is amazing two of my needles where open but</li>
      <li>it wouldnt be able to hold anything bigger than a 9 round liner needle.the power supply is stable and very powerful it does its job</li>
      <li>This was a marginally decent kit, well that is it was before my parents found the packaging that said &amp;#34;Tattoo kit&amp;#34; in the garbage....</li>
      <li>For 30$$ Its a decent investment.</li>
      <li>Machine seems decent, hooked it up to another power supply and it outlines alright.  </li>
      <li>i just wish that it came with more ink caps i ran out after two days, i really cant say anything bad about this kit other than the ink isnt really good to use in skin but its just fine for practice skin if you want to practice.</li>
      <li>Highly recomended.</li>
      <li>CHEAP, NOT A REAL TATTOO KIT.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun and all but only for a starter.</li>
      <li>everything worked and everything was brand new looking.</li>
      <li>you can buy yourself something new...</li>
      <li>everything looks nice well packed except a pink ink leaked a little but didn&#x27;t get on anything since ink is packed in separate plastic bag...</li>
      <li>the ick sucks the most</li>
      <li>the contact screw hole on frame was placed too far forward.</li>
      <li>The ink is mediocre; good for practicing, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on a customer.  </li>
      <li>and then some of the ink bottles was half full</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone. The machine work horribly. It cut on and off. Over heats and sparks a lot.</li>
    <li> Customer service helped me and answered quickly and the machine we got is good quality. It&#x27;s a great starter kit. The CD doesn&#x27;t work so we checked out YouTube for help but I would definitely recommend buying the kit!</li>
    <li> kit was good my only complaint is it doesnt come with transfer paper and gloves and alcohol those sorts of things buti did my first tattoo withit and so far so good.</li>
    <li> As soon as I plugged the power supply into the outlet it burnt out. It really sucks to sell a item knowing its not gonna work. Pissed off! Smfh</li>
    <li> Well I just got it...came in just 3 days everything looks nice well packed except a pink ink leaked a little but didn&#x27;t get on anything since ink is packed in separate plastic bag...I&#x27;m not using the ink though I purchased separate ink because this ink is not good to use ...as soon as I hook it up and use I will let you know more but so far so good</li>
    <li> this tattoo kit came with all the inks presented 1 gun 2 tips both tips are round tips one bigger than they other for shading of course both very tiny tips tho. it wouldnt be able to hold anything bigger than a 9 round liner needle.the power supply is stable and very powerful it does its job well the foot pedal is a little aggravating considering it has toh have metal touch metal and the rubber padding gets in the way of that i had to pull back the padding. it came with roughly 10 needles. 5  5rl needles and 5  9rl needles. everything worked and everything was brand new looking. the fake skin is crap and doesnt take any ink. and the the dvd that comes with it is china made and is in a format unknown to normal men lol doesnt even work in my laptop. but youtube has all the video needed for instruction.</li>
    <li> So it came pretty quickly and i was very excited to start right up, I opened the kit and started assembling the machine, Come to find out it&#x27;s missing a bolt, 2 bolt tightners,grommets, ink cups and rubberbands! All important items you need to run the machine! Do not buy this machine! i am warning you, the price is good but it&#x27;s really not worth it oh and it&#x27;s also missing a pack of needles :(</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  Power supply wouldn&#x27;t work straight out of the box; the power cord seems intact, but the machine will not power on.  The ink is mediocre; good for practicing, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on a customer.  Machine seems decent, hooked it up to another power supply and it outlines alright.  Extremely disappointed in the power supply not working.</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t stay it not a good at all. It something to practice on .but the ick sucks the most</li>
    <li> Everything was ok but the tattoo was not working right and then some of the ink bottles was half full</li>
    <li> everything works good for me just dont turn the voltage up all the way .. i tatted probably 10 tattos or more the ink come out n peels off easy .. contact me on facebook we can help each other out my names josh kartel</li>
    <li> It came really fast, But the machine is a piece of shit. It over heard cuts on and off, and I haven&#x27;t even done any real Tatts with it yet. All though I am Satisfied with The product, its a cool start for Beginners, its cheap, small, Convenient-you get what You pay for... For 30$$ Its a decent investment.</li>
    <li> i just wish that it came with more ink caps i ran out after two days, i really cant say anything bad about this kit other than the ink isnt really good to use in skin but its just fine for practice skin if you want to practice.</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and is exactly as specified. Would I recommend this gun and ink for actual human skin? No. But it is excellent for a beginner that wants to get a feel for the set-up, weight and movement of a tattoo gun. Have some fun with the practice skin and a few grapefruits and when you feel ready (meaning, your lines are straight and your circles are round) you can buy yourself something new...</li>
    <li> Its what was shown so i am happy with what i got i would definitely encourage other people to order through them.</li>
    <li> Item threw sparks overheated armature bar snapped in two. ink was s****. want my money back. i should have read all the bad reviews.</li>
    <li> this works and is good for practice but not really a good machine to use on real skin. all in all it works well</li>
    <li> I wish I had a better way to view all items because I got two brown inks and two peach inks,and even worse,i ordered this item for its instructural dvd.even if it was just audio cd id b happy,but the disc wasempty.</li>
    <li> Dont buy it broke as soon as I turn it on. It started to spark and smell like fire. I didnt even get the chance to use it.</li>
    <li> Sucks don&#x27;t ever buy this. It was broken when I got it. It sparked and wouldn&#x27;t work. I need a refund.</li>
    <li> everything was what was in the picture. WORKS PERFECTLY. don&#x27;t believe these lying losers its a great buy...cd was blank tho</li>
    <li> My power box came broke, when I plugged it up it made a noise and shut off immediately. NOT GOOD</li>
    <li> Tattoo kit came in today works good i like it nothing wrong just gotta tune it a little. If your planning to buy a tattoo machine buy this one!</li>
    <li> got this and have used it a few times and it runs good, you do have to tune it a bit and get it to run the way you want it too.  the inks are kinda low quality remember when you order this to order some more tips too.  b/c it only comes with the outlining tips and needles.  all in all this is perfect for the price</li>
    <li> it is a good kit for the money i think it should have included thermal transfer papern at least 1 to 5 sheets but other than that it is amazing two of my needles where open but its ok because i can sterilize them before i use them it was shipped in two days i was suprized and it is probably your fault that the machine was not working you probably need to loosen / tighten the contact screw sett it to 12v and ajust if still having problems it could be the manufacture but highly unlikely im not trying to hate or troll im just trying to help</li>
    <li> THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY LIFE MUCH MUCH MORE HAPPY.. FOR THE PRICE IT WAS PERFECT I LOVE IT ...</li>
    <li> the machine is nice and so is everything that comes along with it,but the ink isnt of good quality.it doesnt stay in your skin. i would recommend buying another ink and disposing this one. overall the machine itself is a nice starter machine and its durable</li>
    <li> So I receive this kit on the 24th went to put the gun together an the screw wouldn&#x27;t tighten up so after hours of trying to figure out how to fix or go around the situation we had put a screw in it that worked but the gun likes to cut in &amp; out other then that everything else in this package is okay just going to buy a rotary gun instead...</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who is an artist thinking of trying tattooing and it was a perfect starter kit.</li>
    <li> I would consider this product to any tattoo artist who is just starting out. I like that there are 10 different colors of ink that comes with it. The only bad thing about this product is the CD. The CD was blank, but besides that everything is great.</li>
    <li> I dont use it . Worst tattoo gun I ever owned. Barley even works. I wish I never bought it.</li>
    <li> ass the gun suck.. my work with this gun is horroible ink suck too boooooo wait of 40 dollars smdh</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good kit for you to start with...got my kit a few months ago, and gave myself a colored tat with it, and its just starting to fade now, so it could use some better ink...give the gun a good tune, and it works pretty nicely!</li>
    <li> Its nice equipment work very well I love my tattoo machine but only thing is need better ink cuz dat stuff came rite out the skin</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this started giving my self a tat 20 mins after putting it together (8decades has great stuff) can&#x27;t wait till my next order get here :)</li>
    <li> This was a marginally decent kit, well that is it was before my parents found the packaging that said &amp;#34;Tattoo kit&amp;#34; in the garbage.... the two other things were the peddle and the under powered power supply.... my advice would be to just save up five or ten dollars and get a better one....</li>
    <li> Well, we bought another kit and nothing really works in this one besides the paint and the practice skin. The gun is jumpy with voltages and sparks at the impact point like crazy. The power supply doesn&#x27;t even work at all, ive been trying to read voltages off of it with my meters but im only getting about 3 volts max and the pedal decreases the volts. I might have just gotten a s***ty set but over all I wish I bought another one, Im guessing there is no refund or replacement policy.</li>
    <li> CHEAP, NOT A REAL TATTOO KIT. I ORDER FOR MY SON, HE WAS SO DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECMOMMOND THIS KIT, WASTE MONEY.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t got this item yet but already know I&#x27;ll love it and hope ya&#x27;ll do to thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> Works perfect and couldn&#x27;t be any happier now that my husband can do my tattoo&#x27;s and it won&#x27;t cost me a boat load of cash</li>
    <li> i got this in November 2012 and it sitll works great ive done about 150 tattoos and the power box ive keep on for 7 hours tattooing and it wasnt hot at all</li>
    <li> i ordered a few things and included this kit. my package is subject to come today. i was wondering if it came with needles?Other then that i hope all is fine.</li>
    <li> Shipped super quick! Great Deal for basic machine. Was as described on amazon. Highly recomended. Do not really have anything else to add...</li>
    <li> I like this kit it works very well when set up right. The inks are not of great quality but is good for learning,the cd didnt work at all for some reason but i am gla di bought this kit...</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE !! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;THEY WONT RETURN YOUR MONEY EITHER! !!!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS! YOULL REGRET IT</li>
    <li> The kit was just what a starter package needs. No complaints. Should include shaders also but like i said no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> The CD wont work, but over all it looks like it has everything! Now i just hope it works...</li>
    <li> everything is good. power supply sucks..and the ink is so so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the bad reviews are mostly about the inks, the ink is intended as practice ink not human skin. I have used the gun with the green ink to touch up an old tattoo about two three weeks ago it&#x27;s still in there no fading (yet) the gun will run hot if not tuned right.</li>
    <li> I bought this over 2 weeks ago and it never worked and the seller wanted me to figure out what the problem was before anything else. I&#x27;m not an electrician so I didn&#x27;t know why this machine wasn&#x27;t working. I complained again and was never contacted by them again. I would not recommend this machine OR company and i will NEVER trust them again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 2 days ago and it is here. Is exactly as described and well packaged. Simple to use and excited to try it out. Strongly recommend for fellow newbies!</li>
    <li> The machine is not worth the money I paid for it. It&#x27;s falling apart and the ink sold with it is no good.</li>
    <li> gun was nonfunctional do to poor design. the contact screw hole on frame was placed too far forward. which would not allow bar to travel up or down.needless to say gun was spare parts. the rest of the kit was good. but i got what i paid for ($23). and DVD was blank.</li>
    <li> the machine got a little hot but layed good lines for me. the supply is pretty good i am satisfied with the kit for the price it is well worth the money for a amature.</li>
    <li> I ordered this tattoo kit for my boyfriend. It was a good price. And a good deal for starting out. It just doesn&#x27;t come with the coloring needles or the metal tip that you need for coloring. And the ink isn&#x27;t the greatest either.</li>
    <li> I chose a 3 out of 5 only because the machine was not of good quality &amp; the ink was good just to learn with(tattoo skins) I don&#x27;t recommend the ink to use on people but I will say that you get what you pay for this is a great set for a beginner ,&amp; if you want to practice methods &amp; learn how to handle a machine</li>
    <li> Nice little starter kit. CD does not work, some strange format. I would rate this 5 stars if the ink quality was better. Ink does not hold to well. Very fast shipping. Was not expecting the package for at least a week and it was in my mailbox within 3 days of the order.</li>
    <li> I contemplated about getting this but I decided to just get it. It came 4 days after delivery (Saturday-Tuesday) opened it up and came in really good packaging. The gun itself would not work but luckily I already had a tattoo gun. It comes with everything to start tattooing right away. It did not come with gloves though (didnt claim to either.) It comes with the gun, the chord, pedal and power supply, supplies to use when setting up the gun (rubber nipples, rubber bands, The L tool to tighten or loosen) 2 tips for the gun, 10 disposable and sterilized needles, some other bands for the A-Bar of your starting from scratch, ink, ink caps, some practice skin and tattoo DVD. Really great but I do recommend you have a back up tattoo gun incase. Really great quality for the price and I already tattoo free hand on the practice skin. It&#x27;s fun and all but only for a starter. I&#x27;m going to study in college and get an apprenticeship in tattooing before I go pro.</li>
    <li> I got about 3 tattoos out of it before it broke. Ink is cheap and really tiny bottles. Arrived pretty quickly though. Only contained liner needles, and no sanitation items.</li>
