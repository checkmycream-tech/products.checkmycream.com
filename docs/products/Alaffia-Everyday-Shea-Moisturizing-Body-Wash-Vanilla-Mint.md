      <li>It kind of smells like tooth paste, but in a good way.</li>

      <li>Plus, I happen to know that the company is awesome, AND you can find this in the bulk refill section at some natural grocery stores, so you don&#x27;t have to keep buying the packaging over and over again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this body wash and if you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s truly the best.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful purchase, the water here in upstate NY is so hard, this product helps a great deal in combating the problem.</li>
      <li>I also wasn&#x27;t impressed with the way this product left my skin.</li>
      <li>Wash is just ok.  </li>
      <li>Love this body wash</li>
      <li>Love the scent of this body wash.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the minty part when I ordered it</li>
      <li>so I bought this and am really glad I did.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: this body wash is OK, but</li>
      <li>I do love the smell, just don&#x27;t think it holds up to the &amp;#34;shea&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It made my skin feel slightly better after showering, but nothing to write home about.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely better than before, and</li>
      <li>I love the formula of this body wash otherwise</li>
      <li>Love love love this soap - not too many ingredients (I&#x27;m allergic to tons of stuff)</li>
      <li>I think they could of come up with a better combination of flavors.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my armpits will gradually build up more and more of an odor throughout the week, so to combat this</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this body wash.</li>
      <li>It does smell more like spearmint than it does of vanilla.</li>
      <li>I used store bought moisturizing body wash infused with shea butter and magical rejuvenating moisture blasters</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure</li>
      <li>Works better than dove though.</li>
      <li>I intend to purchase more when this bottle runs out.</li>
      <li>maybe two at most.  </li>
      <li>And I personally love the smell of it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using the body wash and drying off I felt very clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>The product is exactly as advertised, a more natural body wash than most on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great after a shower and comes in a nice 32oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even the Dove and Oil of Olay (cheap) brands worked better than this.  </li>
      <li>This product smells great and natural.</li>
      <li>It has a very light sweet spearmint scent that does not over-power and gag.  </li>
      <li>I needed  a new brand to try since Tree Hut changed their formula, and thought that since this was more natural minded it would be the best.</li>
      <li>Easy on the nose and skin.</li>
      <li>Something about the scent just doesn&#x27;t agree with me, but for others it might be fine.  </li>
      <li>The product is also very cost effective.  </li>
      <li>are fantastic though I prefer the mint.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not minty like peppermint or really any kind of mint</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t actually recommend the Lavender scent as it just smells like a nursing home, but the body wash itself is great</li>
      <li>Purchased it because it was gluten free.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and leaves skin soft.</li>
      <li>Texture is good and leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
      <li>Smell is nice, not too strong and not artificially too much either.</li>
      <li>Love this product, smells good, not harsh on skin, more natural than most...used it for years.</li>
      <li>The lather is rich, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to make it lather up.</li>
      <li>(I think this has more to do with washing away the oil from my face since I tend to take hot showers).</li>
      <li>Really rich and moisturizing..</li>
      <li>Feels good on skin, nice and bubbly, and rinses off completely, leaving the skin soft.  </li>
      <li>Eco friendly would recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I originally was using the Dove for Men:</li>
      <li>The spearmint is stronger than the vanilla which I like because it gives it that \\&quot;zippy\\&quot; clean smell &amp; the vanilla softens/sweetens it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You felt incredibly clean after and during the shower, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It lathers alright, but I just never felt really clean after using it.</li>
      <li>The after shower results are a squeaky clean type feeling.</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely and leaves the skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
      <li>Got it for my girlfriend, she could stop using additional body lotions since this did such a good job.</li>
      <li>shea butter, virgin coconut oil &amp; West African Neem extract are all certified Fair Trade.  </li>
      <li>Nice bubbling action.</li>
      <li>I love this product and use the whole line.  </li>
      <li>It has a refreshing cooling effect that really woke me up and made my senses perk up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all so great on paper, but the real issue with this, and it&#x27;s a big one considering this</li>
      <li>The hard water is so dry skin causing, and the scent is perfect and the shipment came really fast, great seller.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price great quality fast shipping</li>
    <li> Arrived spilled in box. Pump would not open and pump until I fiddled with it many times.</li>
    <li> Love love love this soap - not too many ingredients (I&#x27;m allergic to tons of stuff) and it smells divine!</li>
    <li> I have used Tree Hut&#x27;s shea body wash for several years because I break out in hives easily from dry skin... I needed  a new brand to try since Tree Hut changed their formula, and thought that since this was more natural minded it would be the best. Well, it&#x27;s not.  I don&#x27;t like it at all... just one shower and it dried out my skin and I was back to itchy old me.  Even the Dove and Oil of Olay (cheap) brands worked better than this.  I do love the smell, just don&#x27;t think it holds up to the &amp;#34;shea&amp;#34; moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump and the smell is great... just not moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Love this body wash it&#x27;s moisturizing and smells great!  Shipping is fast and the product is well packaged.</li>
    <li> This product smells very strongly of mint. No vanilla at all. If you like to smell minty, then go for it. But if you wanted vanilla, look elsewhere. Other than that, it is just okay to wash with. There are many body washes that are nicer, leaving skin soft and not sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash and if you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s truly the best.  It has a very light sweet spearmint scent that does not over-power and gag.  It has lots of suds but washes off easily and leaves your skin feeling moisturized- not dry and stiff.  I won&#x27;t use anything else and for the price, it&#x27;s a bargain.  One of these bottles lasts about 1.5 months for two adults.  You don&#x27;t need several pumps of it ..maybe two at most.  I&#x27;ve used both the unscented and this vanilla mint and both are fantastic though I prefer the mint.  If you&#x27;re looking for a strong vanilla scent, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this as the vanilla in any of their products is barely noticeable.  The vanilla lotion doesn&#x27;t really smell that vanilla either.</li>
    <li> I have yet to understand what the big deal with this is.  It&#x27;s not very moisturizing at all.  We went back to using Dove.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 7 month old and 3 year old and I&#x27;m really liking it. Really rich and moisturizing.. Doesn&#x27;t work we as a bubble bath, though it is not meant to---given its moisturizing nature, I cant use it as a shampoo for my daughter&#x27;s long hair and I don&#x27;t have to condition afterwards, it detangkes very nicely. Creamy lather, no filmy feeling left behind like with Castile soaps. I&#x27;m a sucker for mint scented body care. Lots of product that stretches very far. Really dig the ingredient list. Switched to this from Burt&#x27;s Bees peppermint/rosemary body wash and I think I will stay with it.&lt;br /&gt; Part of the money you spend goes towards birthing centers in other countries, all the stats and info is on the bogle--wouldn&#x27;t influence my purchase, but is a nice touch!</li>
    <li> Wonderful purchase, the water here in upstate NY is so hard, this product helps a great deal in combating the problem. The hard water is so dry skin causing, and the scent is perfect and the shipment came really fast, great seller.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the vanilla shampoo made by Everyday Shea and really liked it, so I thought I&#x27;d give the body wash a try. I originally was using the Dove for Men: Sensitive Skin (unscented) body wash, but that seemed to make my dry skin worse, especially my facial area. I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for a few weeks now and my skin definitely seems more healthy, however, I still need to apply lotion to my face after a shower (I think this has more to do with washing away the oil from my face since I tend to take hot showers). I enjoy the vanilla scent of it, but be warned: this will not completely get rid of armpit odor. I&#x27;ve noticed that my armpits will gradually build up more and more of an odor throughout the week, so to combat this, I pour some apple cider vinegar on a wash cloth and wipe down my pits every few days BEFORE I take a shower. Afterwards I use the body wash on my armpits and they remain odorless for the rest of the day (unless of course I&#x27;m doing some strenuous exercising).</li>
    <li> Wash is just ok.  Has a nice scent but it doesn&#x27;t linger very long.  It is not as moisturizing as I had hoped it would be.  My son has very dry skin and was looking for something that would be moisturizing in the winter.  The search continues...</li>
    <li> This has a light scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and dry.</li>
    <li> Lathers well and smells good. I&#x27;m not totally sold on it&#x27;s ability to deodorize really smelly armpits though. Nice bubbling action.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I thought it would be based on these reviews, which is disappointing. The after shower results are a squeaky clean type feeling. I really don&#x27;t like the scent either. It&#x27;s not a refreshing minty scent... more like an old toothpaste or piece of gum. No hints of vanilla either. I wonder if the lavender would be nicer?&lt;br /&gt;Just my opinion, but Shea Moisture is much better and actually moisturizes compared to this. I&#x27;d recommend that brand if you&#x27;re looking for good ingredients with an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Also (my fault entirely), I didn&#x27;t realize just how big this bottle was, so now I&#x27;m stuck with this for months.</li>
    <li> Lovely product, great smell. Eco friendly would recommend this product.  Does not dry out your skin and gentle enough for small children.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been using this product for several years and it works great, especially with a sensitivity to sulfites.</li>
    <li> Very nice spearmint scent.  Smooth, pleasant texture.  The product is also very cost effective.  I intend to purchase more when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for those of us with the driest skin.  It smells good and leaves skin soft.</li>
    <li> Smell is nice, not too strong and not artificially too much either.Texture is good and leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Lasts a very, very long time. Not as hydrating as I hoped it would be. Works better than dove though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to write detailed reviews about everything I buy on Amazon, but I&#x27;m sure some people might be in a similar situation as me with their dry skin problems, so I figured I&#x27;d offer my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, this body wash did not provide the miracle relief I was hoping for. Before I purchased this wash, I got to the point where I would dread taking showers. I used store bought moisturizing body wash infused with shea butter and magical rejuvenating moisture blasters blah blah blah. After showering, my entire body would feel completely uncomfortable and sensitive. Tight, itchy, flaky, irritable, you name it. I would even cake on lotion over my whole body right after I dried off. This feeling would last indefinitely, it never really went away, but the few hours after showering were always the worst. It kind of ruined my whole day, everyday. I was desperate for relief, so I turned to google and it brought me here. I threw my credit card at the computer and a few days later I was naked in the shower preparing for a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thoughts: meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely better than before, and I like that it&#x27;s much more natural without all the questionable ingredients (which I hadn&#x27;t really considered until I started researching all of this). It kind of smells like tooth paste, but in a good way. It made my skin feel slightly better after showering, but nothing to write home about. Still desperate, I kept researching, and THIS is where you might find this long review helpful (if you&#x27;ve even made it this far):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading up and feeling hopeful, I grabbed the olive oil that I used earlier that morning to cook eggs and rubbed it all over my body after showering, instead of my normal lotion. This felt pretty strange at first, it almost felt suitable to also grab the Sriracha and start soaking it in, but I stuck with my original plan. Once that was done, I felt like I had been reborn and I wanted to start crab walking around the house and kick my limbs every which way. Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been caking on the olive oil after using this wash in the shower and my skin feels amazing. Now I&#x27;m looking up ways to make olive oil lotion and have found some good recipes online which I will try soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this body wash is OK, but at the level of dryness and sensitivity that my skin was, it didn&#x27;t do wonders. The olive oil is really what made me start feeling like a normal person again. I will probably buy this wash again once I&#x27;m out, because it&#x27;s a good value and better than the store bought nonsense. Plus I like that it smells like tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, not too strong.  Feels good on skin, nice and bubbly, and rinses off completely, leaving the skin soft.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Cleans but doesn&#x27;t really dry your skin.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the minty part when I ordered it but it&#x27;s a bit rejuvenating.</li>
    <li> Its like bathing with spearmint flavored soap.  Just scrub a little more to get clean and use ivory or other for your sweaty parts.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this body wash.  Purchased it because it was gluten free.  Great price for 32oz.</li>
    <li> This Everyday Shea Body wash in Vanilla Mint feels good and the smell is very soothing. One day after use my skin feels very soft. I would recommend to others. *I did use baby oil gel after showering but even compared to using other soaps my skin feels less dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash for 3 years now since my daughter was born. I wanted something that was void of harmful chemicals and if you read the ingredient list this product is perfect! It is very sudsy for a natural body wash and it leaves me feeling clean and smelling minty with a hint of vanilla. Some users have stated that the body wash has a film but if you wash just a little longer for a few seconds the film washes. This body wash is gentle but really leaves you feeling clean. I also have to say that I was very satisfied with the customer service I received from Net Rush.</li>
    <li> This is the best body soap I&#x27;ve ever used,  Feel?  I always leave it foamed up on my body for a couple of minutes because it softens the skin.  The fragrance is also very subtle and pleasant.  I&#x27;ve also moved it to my countertop because I now use it instead of any other soap.  For my face I apply it directly from the bottle with my finger. I can still feel its softness (but  no scent) on my body the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Double thumbs up to those who are introducing new products like this and Crema de la Cream, which has revolutionized shaving.</li>
    <li> It lathers alright, but I just never felt really clean after using it. I did not like the mint smell, it reminded me of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use the whole line.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> 4 out of 5 stars. The product is exactly as advertised, a more natural body wash than most on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great after a shower and comes in a nice 32oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I received the item, some of the body wash had spilled in the package and everything was covered and sticky. No idea if this was the fault of the seller , or the fault of any of the third parties involved in delivering the item.... But I still have to take this into account unfortunately and reduce my 5 stars to 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I still recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural body wash.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t always smell the greatest.  I think they could of come up with a better combination of flavors.  I also ordered the lavender but didn&#x27;t get it.......</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling body wash i&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations; a great scent for men or women, a rich lather (which was not expected due to the sulfate-free claim). I have used the Body Wash, Shampoo, and Conditioner and they are all fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: leave the conditioner in for at least 60 seconds - as recommended on the bottle - you get more moisture out of the conditioner this way.)</li>
    <li> Got it for my girlfriend, she could stop using additional body lotions since this did such a good job. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like the formula of this body wash.  It rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry or waxy.  It really does make my skin feel softer, BUT....this scent is just too much for me.  I thought vanilla mint sounded like such a yummy scent, but its just overpowering in my opinion.  It&#x27;s not minty like peppermint or really any kind of mint you&#x27;re use to.  It&#x27;s more of an herbal mint that is very subtle on the minty side and more overpowering on the herbal/vanilla side.  I literally got a headache using this and the shampoo/conditioner in the same scent every time I showered.  Something about the scent just doesn&#x27;t agree with me, but for others it might be fine.  I love the formula of this body wash otherwise so I&#x27;m going to try the unscented version and hope it works out.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star rating because, to me, there is no flaw with this product. It is moisturizing and smells really good. The lather is rich, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to make it lather up. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I did not find this body wash to be hydrating/moisturizing as it claims. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I work as a chemist at a Battery Recycling Center and we have to take several showers  a day. My skin had become extremely dry from the d-lead handsoap, shampoo, and body wash we must use 2-3 times a day 3 to 5 days a week. I ready about this product in Allure magazine and decided to give it a go. I&#x27;ve tried Dove and other so called moisture body washes but this did the job! My boyfriend compliments me on how much softer my skin is.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by this body wash. The ingredient list so short and natural that I was afraid that it couldn&#x27;t possibly live up to expectations. However, it does lather nicely, the scent is pleasant (more mint than vanilla, but not overpowering in strength), and it gets you clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it&#x27;s not quite as lathery as some other products that do contain sulfates. I have to use more of it than other non-sulfate-free products in order to get enough lather, but 2 pumps in a pouf is sufficient for me. It&#x27;s also a very good value, so I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m really paying much more for the natural alternative in the long run.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this body wash. I really, really wanted to. From the ingredients, to the Fair Trade (and Alaffias very caring policies in general) and even just the bottle design. It&#x27;s all so great on paper, but the real issue with this, and it&#x27;s a big one considering this IS a body wash, is that it simply doesn&#x27;t help with body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Amazon reviewer posted about this issue, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot because it was one review out of a million, but he was correct unfortunately. After coming home from the gym, or if it was a day where I forgot to apply deodorant or just anything happened that caused any sort of BO, the smell was still there after the shower. You felt incredibly clean after and during the shower, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the &amp;#34;Everyone 3-in-1 Soap, Lavender plus Aloe&amp;#34; body wash here on Amazon and it works quite well. Great ingredient list, cheaper than this body wash for more product AND it actually gets rid of any body odor. I wouldn&#x27;t actually recommend the Lavender scent as it just smells like a nursing home, but the body wash itself is great and I&#x27;ve seen glowing reviews for the Citrus scent. Farewell everyone, good luck finding your perfect body wash!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, but I don&#x27;t. The smell was good. The lather is not what I wanted it to be. I have to use between 5-8 pumps to half of my body.I think it is very runny. Seems like it is very thin liquid. Two people will have gone through this container in about two weeks. I will stick to the Dr. Bonner&#x27;s castile soap which cost a little more.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It forms a really rich lather and it has helped my dry skin. I had bough a different body wash that was 1/4 of the size for the same price and wasn&#x27;t even happy with the product so I bought this and am really glad I did. Not only is it a great product that is fair trade and not tested on animals, but is is also a great value. It&#x27;s an all around win. And I personally love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Vanilla Mint 32oz everyday Shea Moisturizing body wash, I was disappointed when the smell was mostly mint. I could not smell the vanilla at all and Vanilla body wash was what I was searching for when I typed in the search box.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER...The mint is very nice, and has made me happy I tried it. I got my package mid-day so I didn&#x27;t get to try out the  body wash til the next morning when I took my shower. It has a refreshing cooling effect that really woke me up and made my senses perk up. It has a wonderful light mint scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;After using the body wash and drying off I felt very clean and refreshed. Just a subtle mint smell stayed with me for a couple hours until I put on my perfume and then I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore and it did not affect my perfumes fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;I used it a couple times during the day on my hands and I wouldn&#x27;t say it is the best at moisturizing the hands but for a body wash this is GREAT! It is just what I need in the morning to wake me up and get my day going. I will be returning to purchase when I run out!!</li>
    <li> Stronger scent than expected, not unpleasant though!</li>
    <li> I tried this and strongly disliked the smell.  After trying it twice I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it again. Sorry, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; but I use it in my kitchen and bathroom as a hand soap.  The smell is so wonderful; spearmint &amp; vanilla is a good combination.  The spearmint is stronger than the vanilla which I like because it gives it that \\&quot;zippy\\&quot; clean smell &amp; the vanilla softens/sweetens it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hands so frequently during the day, I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hands chapped.  This does the job.  It&#x27;s thick, lathers and cleans well.  Also doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my soap dispensers like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  With the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, I had to wash the dispenser hole every day and it left an oily film in my stainless kitchen sinks that took some extra hard scrubbing to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is pretty simple:  Neem Leaf Extract, Handcrafted Shea Butter Soap, Virgin Coconut Oil, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sucrose, Vanilla Extract, Spearmint Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter, virgin coconut oil &amp; West African Neem extract are all certified Fair Trade.  The label on my bottle says that 10% of their sales goes to West Africa community projects such as \\&quot;Bicycles for Education\\&quot;, \\&quot;Maternal Health Care\\&quot;, \\&quot;Reforestation &amp; Environment\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;Alaffia Cooperatives\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy mine at my local co-op.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third round of this product and enjoy using it. It lathers nicely and leaves the skin feeling clean and soft. This product smells great and natural. It does smell more like spearmint than it does of vanilla. I&#x27;m not even sure if I can detect a vanilla scent in this product. I wish you could smell a vanilla scent to this product. Otherwise it is great.</li>
    <li> I really like the feeling and the mint smell is relaxing. I have been using it everyday for the past year! I think this is my third or fourth bottle!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, on the natural/healthy side of things, this stuff is probably great. I&#x27;m all for organic ingredients and leaving out the harsh chemicals. That being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it smells and lathers on, it just reminds me of a bad dog shampoo. I really really really tried to like the scent, but I&#x27;ve grown raw mint and it smells wayyy better. I also wasn&#x27;t impressed with the way this product left my skin. My husband loves the smell of mint and regularly uses tea tree shampoo, but after a few weeks of giving this a try, he asked me to throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m off to try other organic/healthy alternatives!</li>
    <li> Love this product, smells good, not harsh on skin, more natural than most...used it for years.</li>
    <li> This is technically body wash, but I use it as the liquid hand soap in all of our pump dispensers. Many liquid hand soaps use harsh, stripping detergents, and some of the other soap-based ones (like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) have a tendency to clog the pumps and then shoot out like little soap-jets all over you. So that&#x27;s no good. This stuff doesn&#x27;t do that; the consistency is such that it pumps the way you would want it to out of a pump dispenser. It does sometimes get a *tiny* bit clogged, but it&#x27;s easy to just remove the little dried soap lump to clear it out. I&#x27;m telling you, I&#x27;m an insanely picky consumer when it comes to both ingredients and how products perform, and this stuff is hands-down the best natural hand soap I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like using soap-based stuff as a body wash, but this is nice for actual body wash too if you&#x27;re into that. It also doubles as a nice shampoo; helps clear flakes and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair or scalp weird-feeling like other soap-based products. Plus, I happen to know that the company is awesome, AND you can find this in the bulk refill section at some natural grocery stores, so you don&#x27;t have to keep buying the packaging over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the pumps sometimes are stuck and really hard to open, but I once called the company to whine about this and they were incredibly helpful. I forget if they said you had to *push* or *pull* while twisting to get the pump to pop open, but do one of those things over and over again and you&#x27;ll get it, haha. Anyway, I can vouch that these guys are solid, through and through. I&#x27;ve been unimpressed by some of this company&#x27;s other products (they also operate under brands called Alaffia, Everyday Coconut, and some other African Raw Soap name) but this one is totally solid. I hope they never change up the formula or stop making it! Oh, and if mint isn&#x27;t for you (I detect not even a whiff of vanilla, btw) they also make this in lavender and unscented.</li>
    <li> Always good. Easy on the nose and skin. This is hard to find in stores, so it&#x27;s nice that Amazon carries it.</li>
