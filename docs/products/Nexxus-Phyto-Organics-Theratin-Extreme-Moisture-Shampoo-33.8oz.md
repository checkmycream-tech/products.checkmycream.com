<li> lost a lot due to broken pump (poor packaging).</li>
<li> Terrible</li>

    <li> Good product. More than satisfied</li>
    <li> my wife used Nexus shampoo for years and years. they appareently sold the formula and started a new one. she tried it and found that she did not like it. it seems to make her hair too oily and by the end of the day it just didn&#x27;t look or feel right. so, according to her, thumbs down.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist over 30 years ago when I had a perm done on my hair. It worked and made my hair look so great I continued to use it and love love love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many other shampoos and another variety of Nexxus, yet this is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. It has a great sent and a works very well.

    <li> I use this product already for more than 8 years. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality shampoo. Never leaves your hair dry. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product for years to come. Why look for something else.&lt;br /&gt;The old saying. &amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years and I love it.I&#x27;ve used Nexus&#x27; Therapee shampoo in the past and that was a suitable product.But When that became unavailable to me my Barber recommended Theratin and that&#x27;s been a step above anything I&#x27;ve ever used.I definitely would recommend this product to any one.The only drawback was in the shipping and I&#x27;m thankful the shampoo had a cellophane wrap that covered the container because it did have a slight leak around the cap.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  Provides great cleaning and excellent moisture without the need for an additional conditioner or moisturizer.  Great prices from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and how It cleans my hair. I wash, rinse and wash again and on that second time let it stay on a little while to get a good clean before rinsing off - very little shampoo needed to get a great lather! Love that I can but the big size at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 20 years after a recommendation from my barber. I still have a full head of hair and it feels great.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo which works for my hair and water on PEI.</li>
    <li> This product is very good I love the way it smells I like the way it feels on my hair thank you very much</li>
    <li> All I have to say is READ THE INGREDIENTS in this shampoo (and conditioner for that matter) there is no way it is organic, top ingredient is alcohol... A drying agent. Disappointed when I saw that and haven&#x27;t been overly impressed by use.</li>
    <li> this is the best for colored hair...moisturizes leave a shine and gives and protects your coloriing will leave your hair shining and easy to comb</li>
    <li> lost a lot due to broken pump (poor packaging). Otherwise the shampoo is fine.</li>
    <li> Smells GREAT, but does not supply any kind of moisture to your hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing at moisturizing your hair.  It also smells great!!!  I will end up buying all they have.</li>
    <li> Grreat product, great price, quick shipping, reliable seller</li>
    <li> I have used phyto organics for about 15 plus years. I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and phyto organics is just perfect for helping me control my hair. I love the scent of Theratin. If you have not tried this yet, please do give it a chance, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This was the product I was looking for and is no longer available in store.  It met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is fine, the pump is a nightmare to open.  The bottle on the one I got had a pump that we just could not open.  It took my strong son half an hour to help me get the pump up to use.  I almost had to transfer the shampoo to another bottle.  The shampoo is fine, but the only way we finally got the pump to come out to use it was to wrench the base part on super super tight, then pull and twist counter clockwise with every ounce of muscle possible.  Terrible and I don&#x27;t know how others managed to open that. Recommend that they buy better quality pumps.  Shampoo is nice though.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest shampoo I ever tried.  It leaves my hair clean, silky and managable.  My hair is healthier more than ever.  My shampoo for life.</li>
