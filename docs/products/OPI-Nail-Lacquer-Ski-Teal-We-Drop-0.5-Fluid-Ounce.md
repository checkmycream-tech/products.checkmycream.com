      <li>It looks good with pretty much anything I have in my closet.</li>
      <li>I nice, just more blue than teal.</li>
      <li>My nails were clean and just manicured before applying the polish.</li>
      <li>Why in the world have I been paying full price for this stuff at the store?</li>
      <li>This color is really cool and doesn&#x27;t chip off.</li>
      <li>The color I see on my monitor is pretty accurate.  </li>
      <li>It is so pretty!</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, and one cote is  enough, two cotes would be even better.</li>

      <li>It is dark but has a nice hue!</li>
      <li>I had previously bought this color from Ulta and loved it so much I needed another one!</li>
      <li>It is exactly the color that shows in the Amazon.com photos, with the quality of any OPI Nail Lacquer.</li>
      <li>so I fell in love with it instantly and bought it.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s just not as pretty</li>
      <li>But still a pretty shade.</li>
      <li>Love the different names!</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more nail polish from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love this blue!</li>
      <li>It goes on thick, so you don&#x27;t need more than one coat, but be sure to wipe one side of the brush on the opening , so it doesn&#x27;t clump up</li>
      <li>Maybe not blue but other great colors.</li>
      <li>The picture really doesn&#x27;t do any justice.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still very autumnee</li>
      <li>(I just made that word up haha).</li>
      <li>It lasts longer than many of my other polishes.</li>
      <li>It is going back right away!</li>
      <li>To me it&#x27;s more of a dark navy color which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this nail polish.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely LOVE OPI, but when I painted my nails after I received my order the color came out a little greener than I wanted it.</li>
      <li>Very nice dark teal (dark blue-green color)!  </li>
      <li>One of my new favorites that I am adding to my collection.</li>
      <li>On another note, he surprised me with German-icure</li>
      <li>I love the color for something different - usually use on toes.  </li>

<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I really like this nail color</li>
<li> BUT the item I received was half empty and so thick and dry that when I removed the bottle from the shipping box (the bottle had been laying on its side during shipment)</li>

<li> The consistency is thick and neat.</li>
<li> I am disappointed because it is VERY dark in my opinion and looks nothing like the color on the nails in the picture.</li>
<li> I use a base,</li>

    <li> One of the nicest blue shades of nail polish I have ever seen!</li>
    <li> Love This Color!  It goes so well with blue jeans.  It is exactly the color that shows in the Amazon.com photos, with the quality of any OPI Nail Lacquer. This is a MUST HAVE color for any Fashionista Wardrobe. . . .</li>
    <li> I purchased the Ski Til We Drop and in the picture it shows a very beautiful blue so I fell in love with it instantly and bought it. I am disappointed because it is VERY dark in my opinion and looks nothing like the color on the nails in the picture. To me it&#x27;s more of a dark navy color which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
    <li> My favorite OPI nail polish that I&#x27;ve bought so far. I like OPI because they don&#x27;t test on animals. But I also love the color :)</li>
    <li> This arrived today after my husband ordered it because he heard me talking about wanting a blue nail polish. It looks much better online. I don&#x27;t know why in person it&#x27;s just not as pretty but it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ll be returning it. On another note, he surprised me with German-icure and I love it. It&#x27;s not as red looking as it looks online but it&#x27;s still very autumnee (I just made that word up haha).</li>
    <li> I got a lot of compliments on the color (I have fair skin and I keep my nails short and round) and there was no surprise on the quality, since OPI is one of the best on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPI is a little thicker than Essie, so a little bit harder to apply and takes a little bit longer to dry but it definitely lasts longer in my opinion.  I use a base, 2 coats of OPI, and a top coat, and the nail polish lasts about 7 - 8 days before chipping apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color is a mix of navy and teal, closer to Navy than teal.  The color I see on my monitor is pretty accurate.  Maybe a little bit darker in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Opi is a great quality of nail polish. I will only by opi for this reason. Opi seems to not chip as much as other nail polishes. Love the different names!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love opi nail polish. This color is really cool and doesn&#x27;t chip off. Highly recommend this nail polish.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter for one of her stocking stuffers. She loves the color. Looks great on toes also.</li>
    <li> I love OPI.  I love OPI colors.  I wish they came out with great lipsticks as well.  Maybe not blue but other great colors.</li>

    <li> This is a great color! It goes on good too. It is a perfect color for fall. I love opi!</li>
    <li> The color is really dark but not black. It&#x27;s the color of deep lake. Blue but little bit sense of dark green. Easy to apply, and one cote is  enough, two cotes would be even better.</li>
    <li> The cooler is a little more blue and less teal than I had wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The polish I nice, just more blue than teal.</li>
    <li> I love the color for something different - usually use on toes.  It is dark but has a nice hue!</li>
    <li> great nail polish and received a lot sooner than estimated, very satisfied! love the color.</li>
    <li> OPI never disappoints! Gorgeous color, applies smoothly, dries quickly, and looks ravishing! This product shipped with great speed, and I am delighted with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color! It lasts longer than many of my other polishes.</li>
    <li> I just received my OPI - &amp;#34;Ski Teal We Drop&amp;#34; - GORGEOUS COLOR - Loved it on my last pedicure (from salon).  BUT the item I received was half empty and so thick and dry that when I removed the bottle from the shipping box (the bottle had been laying on its side during shipment) The polish inside the bottle DID NOT settle back to the bottom!  I even shook the bottle vigorously and it did not budge!!  It is going back right away!</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful, looks amazing. I put two coats on, but it wasn&#x27;t really necessary. The consistency is thick and neat. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased Ski Teal We Drop awhile ago. It is still my fave color. Sometimes it requires 3 coats (rarely) but it is a beautiful true teal color.</li>
    <li> Very nice dark teal (dark blue-green color)!  Got lots of compliments.  I normally don&#x27;t use blue nail polish, but this shade is very nice and great for fall/winter seasons.</li>
    <li> I was completely satisfied with the product and even more happy with the process of ordering &amp;#34;online&amp;#34; with such efficiency.</li>

    <li> Is really more of a BLUE teal. But still a pretty shade.</li>
    <li> One of my new favorites that I am adding to my collection. OPI has the best nail polish!</li>
    <li> OPI is nice. Love the color. Lasted for a really long time on my toes. I had a bit of a problem with my fingernails. The polish seemed to bubble but only sometimes.My nails were clean and just manicured before applying the polish. Maybe the brush wasn&#x27;t wide enough for me.</li>
    <li> Great brand and color!</li>
