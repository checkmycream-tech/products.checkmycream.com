<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for some years and it has never changed!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought many moisturizers (I&#x27;m over 50) in an attempt to keep away as many wrinkles as possible.  This is the one day- moisturizer that produces a visible result for me.  It is not greasy and has a slight pleasant scent. I spend less money on this than the many other items I&#x27;ve bought with a result that surpasses the others.  It definitely works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It came very quickly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this only because there were so many great reviews about this replenishing cream. After 2 weeks of using it I received a lot of compliments how my face looked radiant with a glow. I don&#x27;t  like the smell of it too much. I love that it is not greasy and I love the results. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that I have used on my face for the past twenty years or so.&lt;br /&gt;And, as long as I can find it, I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty low maintenance chick, but where I live, it&#x27;s dry.  You need lotion and you need moisturizer.  I started using this in 1987 at age 20, when I was selling Avon in college.  I have to say, my looks and my face have held up quite well.  This is coming from a woman who works the night shift most of the time, rarely gets enough sleep, doesn&#x27;t eat right half the time, doesn&#x27;t exercise enough and used to smoke for 20 years out of the 45 years on this planet.  Most people never guess that I am 45, they usually tell me late 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s.  I tell people if they want to keep looking great drink lots of water and use a moisturizer every day.  My moisturizer of choice is Nurtura.  I live in a very dry climate, (Colorado,) and you can really feel it working and getting to every pore of your face.  I have fairly sensitive skin and it is non-irritating and has never caused a break out.  It feels great going on.  It&#x27;s nice and fluffy and thick, but not too greasy.  It has a pleasant fragrance.  My normal routine has been washing my face with dove soap, and then using Nurtura.  I have never needed to do anything else.  No cleansers, no facial masks, no scrubbers, no spas.  It is also quite economical.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have used it for years can&#x27;t see myself using anything different. I&#x27;m glad I can still find it.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years and Avon stopped making it.....glad  I found it on here...now I have to find something to replace it when I run out! :(</li>
    <li> this is a really good product. I will be recommend this to may friends and family for sure. love it</li>
    <li> She usually buys this stuff at the store, but saw a better deal on Amazon.  She says it&#x27;s the same stuff.  I wouldn&#x27;t know, my face is so pretty I wouldn&#x27;t need to use it.</li>
    <li> this cream was once sold by Avon.  miss it and was very happy I found it on amazon. make my skin very soft!!!</li>
    <li> My grandma loved this product and when it was discontinued she was very upset. So glad I could find it on Amazon for her. She ordered 3 jars and plans to order more once she finishes those. It was great seeing her so happy!</li>
    <li> I have used this face cream for years.  I am 62 and only have a few wrinkles under my eyes.  Also great for the neck!</li>
    <li> Excellent basic cream at a terrific price.  Moisturizes well.  Not greasy.  Lovely texture.  Good to use as a break from creams with esoteric ingredients.</li>

    <li> I love this Avon moisturizer. I&#x27;m 53 years old, and was looking for a product that moisturized well without breaking the bank. This is that product. There&#x27;s a nice fragrance. It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly. I will be buying more.</li>
