      <li>so it&#x27;s nice to see I can also get it here.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nice to see it here</li>
      <li>The scent is very light and airy.</li>
      <li>but i love it.</li>
      <li>now.looking out for more sprays in this fragrance</li>
      <li>So glad I found it online.</li>
      <li>Will not by more.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I read all the reviews on this because I&#x27;d never used it before and was searching for a nice, clean fragrance, but this was not as described.  </li>
      <li>Its lighter than musk oil but like musk, it blends well with a woman&#x27;s body heat to create an earthy yet light fragrance that will surely entice and stimulate.  </li>
      <li>Stays on all day and is easy to carry with you.</li>
      <li>I love this scent, it smells so fresh.</li>
      <li>Have worn this light body spray for years.</li>
      <li>It gets in my throat and in my lungs, and sends me into a coughing fit.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this product, but it is a bit strong in the scent when first spraying.  </li>
      <li>Thank you, I love this perfume and it arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>Love this body spray - always makes you smell fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>First off, I really do love this scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh, light, and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>It takes time to find a cologne that works and has the light, fresh scent this one does by Prince Matchabelli.</li>
      <li>I like a fresh clean scent and this does the trick.  </li>
      <li>Fresh White Musk by Prince Macchiavelli is a reasonably-priced cologne with an indescribably good scent.</li>
      <li>, rather it&#x27;s a light, musk that has just a hint of jasmine a clean, fresh scent without that is crisp without the fruity aspect some perfumes or body sprays have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Plus, it has alcohol as well, but not as strongly as the Coty Wild Musk.  </li>
      <li>My favorite along with Jovan white musk for women.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday spray, light, fresh, slightly musky, but like a fresh floral overlay.  </li>
      <li>fast service...great product</li>
      <li>Thanks for having to purchase.</li>
      <li>Really like the scent, but not that much.</li>
      <li>VERY</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does get a little too strong at first, and i wud always cough when i applied it...</li>
      <li>I have always use this after bath spray,and love it, but started having trouble finding it in stores.</li>
      <li>I decided to try it instead of my Jovan White Musk body spray that I usually use, and I love this!</li>
      <li>Asked managers to stock but so far they are just stocking cotton candy and vanilla.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance is soft like lavender</li>
      <li>My one complaint would be, the cost of shipping being much more than the product it self.</li>
      <li>I just have find a nice clean fragrance with an oil base.</li>

    <li> I have searched for this all over town. Asked managers to stock but so far they are just stocking cotton candy and vanilla.  I LOVE this fragrance. It is not  too flowery, not too fruity and doesn&#x27;t smell like candy. Fragrance is soft like lavender but I feel elderly when I wear lavender. Hope Amazon keeps offering this product!!!</li>
    <li> I dont order this from amazon because I can usually get it at one of my local walmarts, it is hard to find most times though so it&#x27;s nice to see I can also get it here. I love this scent, it smells so fresh. My favorite along with Jovan white musk for women.</li>
    <li> I decided to try it instead of my Jovan White Musk body spray that I usually use, and I love this! It&#x27;s a great everyday spray, light, fresh, slightly musky, but like a fresh floral overlay.  VERY NICE!&lt;br /&gt;Hope I can find the perfume.  Seems it&#x27;s hard to find now.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get this in stores anymore that I know of.  Love the smell and hope I can keep finding it online!</li>
    <li> I picked this up at a local cvs but it&#x27;s nice to see it here too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a scent that is not too floral or fruity, rather it&#x27;s a light, musk that has just a hint of jasmine a clean, fresh scent without that is crisp without the fruity aspect some perfumes or body sprays have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for using out of the shower and on the go. It takes time to find a cologne that works and has the light, fresh scent this one does by Prince Matchabelli. Good stuff. All in all, recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aryan Somers</li>
    <li> First off, I really do love this scent. It&#x27;s fresh, light, and lasts for hours. HOWEVER, what I DON&#x27;T like is the fact that I have to hold my breath when I spray it, and immediately rush out of the room. This literally HANGS in the air for over an hour after it&#x27;s been sprayed. It gets in my throat and in my lungs, and sends me into a coughing fit. Once, my son told me he walked through my bathroom (about an hour &amp; a half after I had left for work), and he started coughing, because it was still in the air. No matter how little of it I spray, or how close the proximity, the result is the same. The scent really is wonderful, and would have earned 5 stars if not for that.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product, but it is a bit strong in the scent when first spraying.  You almost have to stand way back, so your not overpowered.  I need to let you know that I will not be ordering again ,due to the cost of shipping .  The product was 1.49 for each.  I ordered 4 of this product, and the shipping was $20.95.  All four came in a small package and weighed very little.  I would like to know why I wasn&#x27;t charged one shipping fee.  I have ordered other items online, and sometimes there were 6 items, and I was only charged one fee.  This shipping fee was way out of bounds.  Really like the scent, but not that much.</li>
    <li> I really do not care for this fragrance.  It was just me - not the product.  Will not by more.</li>
    <li> I like a fresh clean scent and this does the trick.  Stays on all day and is easy to carry with you.</li>
    <li> I have always use this after bath spray,and love it, but started having trouble finding it in stores. My one complaint would be, the cost of shipping being much more than the product it self.</li>
    <li> fast service...great product</li>
    <li> Love this body spray - always makes you smell fresh and clean.  I would recommend to any buyer.  Thanks for having to purchase.</li>

    <li> I gave this a five star rating. The scent is very light and airy. Would recommend to anyone to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this online and i dont regret it at all.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is beautiful and stays all day long.&lt;br /&gt;It does get a little too strong at first, and i wud always cough when i applied it...but i love it. so much so i am addicted to white musk now.looking out for more sprays in this fragrance</li>

    <li> Very strong, it will make you sneeze but you will smell good!</li>
    <li> Long lasting scent. I wish it came in non-aerosol form. If you have breathing issues be sure to be in large open space when spraying or you may find it to momentarily make it difficult to breathe if spraying within a small room.</li>
