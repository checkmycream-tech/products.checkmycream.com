      <li>This pencil stays on very well, and the color blends in with my brows perfectly.</li>
      <li>This one is great for a quick fill in or you can go all out with it.</li>
      <li>Smooth transaction and a good seller.</li>
      <li>and it is easy to use!</li>
      <li>Take your time and go nice and easy.  </li>
      <li>but, if you want to fill and define your existing brows without looking like you use a brow pencil, I think you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It makes my life easier :)</li>
      <li>I love the spoolie on the end.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>so whenever I would twist out more pencil</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I love Anastasia products</li>
      <li>time using this product and im NOT disappointed!!!</li>
      <li>as many of the drugstore brow pencils have.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfect, in the middle tool, that gives you the ease and glide of a pen, but not the harshness.  </li>
      <li>and we both love this product.</li>
      <li>The shape of the applicator and the texture of the pencil give one great control, and create a natural looking brow, that doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
      <li>Easy learning curve.</li>
      <li>This product makes filling in your eyebrows easy and it lasts.</li>
      <li>Smaller lead for precise application, beautiful color and coverage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and makes for precise lines.  </li>
      <li>i have to be super carefull and make sure it doesnt fall out and break..</li>
      <li>Looks ok just by itself but runs out quickly.</li>
      <li>I like to use this in combination with some eyebrow powder, I find that it&#x27;s best used for small details.</li>
      <li>But overall it&#x27;s a nice product!</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite eyebrow pencil ever.</li>
      <li>The color payoff is pretty good, but if you&#x27;re looking for a little more Anastasia brow pomade is the way to go!</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and very natural looking</li>
      <li>Looks more natural than powder and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The most natural looking eyebrow filler.</li>
      <li>Overall, it did fill in my brows nicely.</li>
      <li>Love it....makes my brows look natural</li>
      <li>but i rarely have to touch it up any since it stays on so well.</li>
      <li>Loved the brush at the other end.</li>
      <li>I tried to return it right away, but did not get a response.</li>
      <li>Would right a review on my Anastasia brow Wiz that arrived today</li>
      <li>but When i opened it for the first time the pencil part fell right out of the tube...</li>
      <li>You get a nice soft natural brow.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have very much in the way of eyebrows and the Anastasia Brow Wiz helps me contour and shape.</li>
      <li>Not harsh strokes like you get with some cheap pencils.</li>
      <li>Very pricey, but reliable, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, but I&#x27;m not sure it was completely worth all the hype.  </li>
      <li>I love everything about the Brow Wiz from the color (soft brown is great for dark blonde, light-med brown or highlighted hair) to the ease at which it rolls on.....</li>
      <li>Even if the color was good the brow pencil is extremely cheap, I haven&#x27;t even used it for a month and is already broken.</li>
      <li>Filled in my eyebrows and doesn&#x27;t look fake, just looks like my own brows!</li>
      <li>In the picture it looked a lot darker, but when I got it, it&#x27;s really lighter than I need.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Gentle strokes over the brow area.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>I have used these pencils two years now, and I might try the Dipbrow by Anastasia next, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find myself coming back to this everytime.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that it runs out too quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is the first thing I apply every morning, and if I wear no other makeup, I will always use this to fill out my eyebrows while maintaining a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>The soft brown is a little light for me, but my eyebrows are pretty dark, I have invested in the color chocolate, and that seems to fit me.</li>
      <li>It looks very natural.</li>
      <li>The brush is now bigger, the first one I bought had a shorter brush.  </li>
      <li>Would have given it higher rating but the pencil didn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>The brown is a little darker than expected but overall the product is fabulous!!!</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve aged, my brows have become thinner with a lot more grey hairs.  </li>
      <li>cause it is a bit lighter than my natural eye brow color.</li>
      <li>but until I find something cheaper that looks natural, this is my go to all the time.</li>
      <li>I am now paying the same amount as the first purchase for less product, how is this right.</li>
      <li>But, it does fill in all the grey and fills in the empty spaces of my thin brows beautifully.  </li>
      <li>I made a major beauty mistake and created a bald spot in my brow.</li>
      <li>It stays on and blends like no other.  </li>
      <li>But because the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; is so thin, which helps with precision, the pencil does run put pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It lasts all day and the thin shape allows for very precise application.  </li>
      <li>Wasted more than half the product.</li>
      <li>The product itself is a good product, however when I received it, the pencil was broken into quite a few pieces</li>
      <li>You cannot press hard or try to do your brows quickly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My very favorite brow pencil. The only one I will ever use now that I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
    <li> Awful product. Its like trying to paint your eyebrows...it&#x27;s messy, wet and doesn&#x27;t dry. I tried to return it right away, but did not get a response. Wasted $20. Overall, a useless product.</li>
    <li> I like to use this in combination with some eyebrow powder, I find that it&#x27;s best used for small details. Looks ok just by itself but runs out quickly.</li>
    <li> hard to tell when product is running out</li>
    <li> I love Anastasia products but this one is lighter than expected... My mistake</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite eyebrow pencil ever. Never will I switch to another brand of brow pencils.</li>
    <li> When I opened the cap literally the whole stick of product was dry, broken and it fell out</li>
    <li> I am obsesses with all Anastasia brow products and this I no different. Great pencil. Very thin for a realistic look after application. Your brows should look awesome, not like they were drawn on lol. I recommend.</li>
    <li> The most natural looking eyebrow filler.</li>
    <li> My sis got me the dip brow and after watching tutorials I decided to purchase this brow wiz,  (plus 1 for my sis, too!) and we both love this product. Works great for those areas that the dip brow can&#x27;t fill in.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product with no hesitation. It makes my life easier :)</li>
    <li> I have to press on it very hard for the pencil to be apply onto my eyebrow which hurts me sometimes</li>
    <li> I really like this product but when I purchased it for the second time, the design changed.  The brush is now bigger, the first one I bought had a shorter brush.  The overall size of the product is the same but now with a larger brush and less product.  I am now paying the same amount as the first purchase for less product, how is this right.</li>
    <li> I love everything about the Brow Wiz from the color (soft brown is great for dark blonde, light-med brown or highlighted hair) to the ease at which it rolls on.....it&#x27;s not a pen, but not a pencil consistency.  It&#x27;s a perfect, in the middle tool, that gives you the ease and glide of a pen, but not the harshness.  If you&#x27;re into big, dramatic, heavily colored in eyebrows, this probably isn&#x27;t for you;  but, if you want to fill and define your existing brows without looking like you use a brow pencil, I think you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite brow pencil!</li>
    <li> The brown is a little darker than expected but overall the product is fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> I love the spoolie on the end. In the picture it looked a lot darker, but when I got it, it&#x27;s really lighter than I need. It did spread easily enough when using the brush.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but I&#x27;m not sure it was completely worth all the hype.  I&#x27;ve used other similar products that were less expensive and did the same thing.  I like that it has a spoolie attached.  And the formula is hard, not mushy at all, which I have seen with other brow pencils. It&#x27;s easy to apply and makes for precise lines.  Would I recommend this product? Yes.  Would I repurchase? No.  Just because I can find something less expensive that works just as well.  But overall it&#x27;s a nice product!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and very natural looking</li>
    <li> Would right a review on my Anastasia brow Wiz that arrived today but it arrived broken I was so looking forward to using it after reading many good reviews but now I&#x27;m cancelling the second one I have on the way</li>
    <li> Great brow pencil but runs out quickly! Stays put, color selection is good too. Lasts about a month with daily use.</li>
    <li> Good it doesn&#x27;t give you a lot of product but that&#x27;s how it is now a days you never get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This is the best brow filler I&#x27;ve tried. Looks more natural than powder and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil I have ever used.  It stays on and blends like no other.  Smooth transaction and a good seller.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very much in the way of eyebrows and the Anastasia Brow Wiz helps me contour and shape.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, my brows have become thinner with a lot more grey hairs.  And I have tried all kinds of brow pencils but nothing comes close to Brow Wiz.  The thinnest pencil I&#x27;ve ever seen and initially I thought - this is never going to work.  But, it does fill in all the grey and fills in the empty spaces of my thin brows beautifully.  You cannot press hard or try to do your brows quickly.  Patience.  Take your time and go nice and easy.  Gentle strokes over the brow area.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> great product, i have been buying this for over a year and I LOVE IT! stays on all day no re application needed.</li>
    <li> I like it but When i opened it for the first time the pencil part fell right out of the tube... so everytime i open it i have to be super carefull and make sure it doesnt fall out and break..</li>
    <li> I have tried other brow products to fill in my scarce brows and this is the only product that looks natural. I have dark brown/black hair, and i usually get soft brown and it looks very natural. I hate the price but until I find something cheaper that looks natural, this is my go to all the time.</li>
    <li> My go to brow pencil. Very pricey, but reliable, so it&#x27;s worth it. You get a nice soft natural brow. Not harsh strokes like you get with some cheap pencils. The formula is also not too waxy. My preference. The brush in the other end adds to the convenience and helps to further soften the results. Also great that it&#x27;s automatic. No need to sharpen the pencil points. But because the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; is so thin, which helps with precision, the pencil does run put pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Absolutly loveeee this product!&lt;br /&gt;perfection in a pencil !&lt;br /&gt;First time using this product and im NOT disappointed!!! will keep buying!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I love all of Anastasia&#x27;s products. This one is great for a quick fill in or you can go all out with it. The color payoff is pretty good, but if you&#x27;re looking for a little more Anastasia brow pomade is the way to go! Love all her products, can&#x27;t go wrong. The soft brown is a little light for me, but my eyebrows are pretty dark, I have invested in the color chocolate, and that seems to fit me.</li>
    <li> Love it....makes my brows look natural</li>
    <li> Anastsia is the best brow pencil ever, bar none!  And I have tried them all.  The shape of the applicator and the texture of the pencil give one great control, and create a natural looking brow, that doesn&#x27;t rub off. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the amount one get&#x27;s in one pencil.</li>
    <li> Would have given it higher rating but the pencil didn&#x27;t last. Obviously very short pencil. Loved the brush at the other end.</li>
    <li> I made a major beauty mistake and created a bald spot in my brow. After panic I did some research. This worked! Not to dark or fake. Easy learning curve. Saved me!</li>
    <li> Great product- my brows pop and it is easy to use!</li>
    <li> A great product! Filled in my eyebrows and doesn&#x27;t look fake, just looks like my own brows! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> this is my go-to eyebrow applicator. This is the first thing I apply every morning, and if I wear no other makeup, I will always use this to fill out my eyebrows while maintaining a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look. It is a teeny tiny pencil lead and prone to breaking, so you have to be careful not to break it off (because it is hard to find the broken lead to somehow stick it back into the applicator). I have used these pencils two years now, and I might try the Dipbrow by Anastasia next, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find myself coming back to this everytime.</li>
    <li> love this product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The pencil was broken already when I got it.</li>
    <li> Even if the color was good the brow pencil is extremely cheap, I haven&#x27;t even used it for a month and is already broken. I&#x27;m really disappointed. Don&#x27;t buy it for the brow pencil.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The only downside is that it runs out too quickly.  I got about two and a half months out of it.</li>
    <li> It seemed like the eyebrow pencil wasn&#x27;t new only had a small piece of the actual liner, it fell out from the pencil.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of using this product the pencil broke. A bit disappointed since it is a pricey product compared to other brow pencils out there. Overall, it did fill in my brows nicely.</li>
    <li> Smaller lead for precise application, beautiful color and coverage. Anastasia Beverly Hills KNOWS brows. This product makes filling in your eyebrows easy and it lasts. I fill mine in everyday and it has lasted me a month so far.</li>
    <li> This pencil stays on very well, and the color blends in with my brows perfectly. The brow brush on the other ends helps with blending it and also brushing my brows in place. Great pair for on the go or touch ups.. but i rarely have to touch it up any since it stays on so well. Even in humid conditions.</li>
    <li> The product itself is a good product, however when I received it, the pencil was broken into quite a few pieces so whenever I would twist out more pencil it would just fall out. Wasted more than half the product.</li>
    <li> Best brow pencil ever.</li>
    <li> Using it along with Dipbrow Pomade in Medium Brown. I wish I ordered Brow Wiz in same color cause it is a bit lighter than my natural eye brow color. But anyway it does a great job in creating a nice shape I need.</li>
    <li> Love this. I have black or rather dark dark brown hair. Coulda gone a tad darker but I like this color for every day. It looks very natural.</li>
    <li> This is the only brow pencil I use - and have been devoted for YEARS.  Excellent wear.  The shades have an ash undertone - not &#x27;red&#x27; as many of the drugstore brow pencils have.  It lasts all day and the thin shape allows for very precise application.  LOVE IT.</li>
