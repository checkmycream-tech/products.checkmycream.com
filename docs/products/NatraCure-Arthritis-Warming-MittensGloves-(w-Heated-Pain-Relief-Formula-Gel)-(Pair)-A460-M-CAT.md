    <li> They are the best, they really help with my nerve damage</li>
    <li> She says they retain heat for a long time. She likes to put moisturizer on her hands then heat these gloves and wear them. She wanted to remove one star because they are a little bit difficult to get on.</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of this but I don&#x27;t like the rubbery material inside. They are difficult to put on and it will melt. They do hold their heat and do feel amazing on my sore hsnds. Would be perfect without that material inside.</li>
    <li> I want to return these. The gloves are lined with silicone of some kind that feels kind of slimy against the skin. The liner gets so hot, you can&#x27;t use it right away. Then when you can put the gloves on, they don&#x27;t hold heat more than five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have large hands but the gloves don&#x27;t fit tight enough to feel any significant weight. Instead of moisturizing my hands, it feels kind of sweaty. Not what I expected at all.</li>
    <li> These really help my hands.  Sure wish I purchased them sooner.</li>
    <li> The heat therapy mittens are fabulous and really help with arthritis pain.  They heat and cool perfectly.  They heat my hands evenly and eliminate pain temporarily.  They are such a helpful pain management tool.</li>
    <li> I love these for my arthritic hands, altho because they are gel inside they stick together a bit.  I turn them inside out and they warm my hands so well and make them feel so much better.  The best thing I&#x27;ve found for achy hands and fingers.  They really hold the heat.</li>
    <li> These are either to dang hot or too cold.... And should have lining the inside stuff is stickyish and therefor hard to slide onto my arthritic hands... They should also extend at least a little to wrists</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom...she loves it! She has arthritis and this really helps with her swelling and when her hands are in pain</li>
    <li> I had to play around with the time for the microwave at first to get them hot enough but not too hot.  The heat therapy gloves do help and have made mny hands feel better.  Do be very careful the first time you usee them that you don&#x27;t get them too hot.  I nearly burned my hands.  You do have to make sure they are hot enough though too or they don&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> The mittens are &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; on inside making them uncomfortable to wear, and in addition, it is very difficult to have the heat consistent. They are too hot in some places (fingers) and not hot enough in others.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not like this product. I ordered it for me Mom to sooth her arthritis. The first time heated was a little to cool, then to hot because the plastic rubber inside the glove got way to hot. Once they cooled and she was able to put her hands in, they belt ok but cooled off to quickly. When I went to reheat them again, the rubber stuck together and the gloves were no longer able to be used. I think this product may be defective. It would have been better for them to be fabric lined because the rubber inside is unfomfortable and way to hot when heated. The company however, stood by the customer and refunded me promptly and was very quick to respond. I did not have a problem returning, I would order something else from them if they carry another kind of glove to try.</li>
    <li> Good product. ..thank you :)</li>
    <li> Great mittens. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The mittens are sturdy and well made but my mother has difficulty getting her hands inside the mittens as they are made from a material that is ... Not easily able to slip hands into.</li>
    <li> These are so much better than a wax bath.  They heat quickly in the microwave BUT you must stay there and watch so that you can remove them as so as the patch turns red.  Do not just put your hands into the mitts.  Test the inside temperature and put the mitts on only if it feels comfortable.  Following these simple steps will eliminate so of the problems other users have complained about.</li>
    <li> THEY  do not meet my expectations... they do not get very hot nor do they stay warm very long.  I will not recommend them and i would like a refund.  Please help me make this happen, I purchased them for the purpose of post surgery comfort after hand joint replacement. Gayle LIndeblom</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find a rubbery lining to this product.  I heated the glove carefully and when the dots turned red I started to slide it on, which was difficult due to the \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; lining.  I had to withdraw my hand quickly as the rubber lining transferred the heat so quickly that it was felt like it was burning my skin.  I have been using these mittens inside out which helps in two ways.  First , it no longer burns my skin and the rubber lining which is now on the outside helps to grip things such as coffee cups.</li>
    <li> These work really well, but I found them uncomfortable.  The interior feels, well, slimy.  They are not, of course, but the feeling is very odd.  If you are not bothered by this, though, they will work well for you.</li>
    <li> NOT GOOD FOR MY HANDS. NOT HELPING WITH ARTHRITIS. MAYBE THO MIGHT GOOD FOR OTHERS. WAS HOPING FOR MORE HELP.</li>
