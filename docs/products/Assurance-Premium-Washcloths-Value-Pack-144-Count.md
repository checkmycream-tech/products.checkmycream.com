    <li> Great for quick wipedowns, or as a hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say that I love this brand and product.  Assurance is the only wipes and under pads I use on my mother; now bedridden.  Please believe me, you will never be left lacking with this product.</li>
    <li> Great in a pinch. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Nice thick large soft strong wipes. We use on Alzheimer&#x27;s dad. They seem very gentle.</li>
    <li> With the water shortage these come in handy. Nice clean scent and  doesn&#x27;t fall apart leaving any particles on you.</li>
    <li> terrific ----- they are big----- and soft, smell good and don&#x27;t need to be laundred&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t go wrong with them</li>
    <li> A great product but do not understand the pricing.  This would cost $0.20 each whereas the smaller package is at $0.14 each.  Very happy with the price of the other and will order that size instead now.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Not a fan of the pricing. This box contains 3 (48 count) packages. I paid almost $24 for the box. This makes each package about $8 a piece! Do yourself a favor and make a trip to the retail stores that sell the 48 count pack for $2.62 each.</li>
    <li> These work great when you are short on time between going to the gym and leaving for work.  I bought a whole case since I go to the gym 3 mornings a week at 5 AM and have to be at work before 7:30.  I prefer them a bit more wet, so I put them under a bit of warm water.</li>
