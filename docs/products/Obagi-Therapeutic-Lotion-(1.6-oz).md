<li> I&#x27;ve noticed minor drying, but I&#x27;d rather deal with that than acne.</li>
<li> One other reason why I decide to use it too is because I thought my skin was &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; enough to accept the product now and it did.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
<li> I am using this product in conjunction with the Obagi ClenziDerm Foaming Wash for oily skin, so I cannot attribute my results entirely to one or the other.</li>

<li> I would recommend as long as you use carefully.</li>

<li> and this product definitely dries my skin out a little.</li>
<li> That wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, so I gave it more time...</li>

<li> the tingling (borderline burning) sensation scared me a little.  </li>
<li> I admit I was a little nervous</li>
<li> Start using it a few times a week and work your way up to using it once a day.</li>
<li> I have a few pimples still but before using this product about 50% of my face was covered in ance.  </li>
<li> It has already improved my acne after one week without excessive drying.  </li>
<li> Not sure if this product can help that though.</li>
<li> I don’t usually wear foundation</li>
<li> I had two small zits that I could feel if I run my hands over my face - these may be zits that would&#x27;ve surfaced anyway and sat there for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product has cleared up my chronic acne 100%. I originally bought the whole therapeutic skin care system from my doctor. It cleared me up significantly within 2 weeks, 4 months in and my skin is amazingly clear! Glad I can save some serious $ buying just the treatment lotion at a significant discount 50%. For others considering this product, do it! I tried almost everything under the sun and was even contemplating accutane.&lt;br /&gt;FYI.... Be consistent in the application!!</li>
    <li> Great product for acne skin. It will not disappoint. I have tried many products over the years and spend thousands of dollars in effort to find a product that can control my acne. This is the holy grail product and will recommend to anyone. This stuff really works!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product...have had no breakouts since using 2x daily the past several weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is truly a miracle. It has cleared up my acne better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried, including prescription creams. If you suffer from uncontrollable acne, give this a shot. It is worth the money. I have purchased this product on Amazon and at a medical spa. I did not see a difference. From what I can tell, I do not think the amazon version is a knock off, although others claim a difference.</li>
    <li> Im ordering this product 3 time already. Cant live without it! its absolutely best for fighting pimples! trust me, i tried almost everything.</li>
    <li> Benzoyl or salicylic? I&#x27;ve seen these two ingredients all over acne products - one or the other. However, they help two very different kinds of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzoyl is for deep acne that hasn&#x27;t surfaced yet. OBAGI THERAPUTIC LOTION is Benzoyl based and it works great on diminishing acne before it surfaces and becomes a bigger problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid is for surface acne. It kills bacteria on the surface and exfoliates the surface. For this - I love Murad&#x27;s Exfoliating Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routines is once every 2-3 days I moisturize my face (this dilutes product just a bit so it&#x27;s not so strong) and then put a thin layer of both products all over my face. However, I&#x27;ll dab OBAGI THERAPUTIC LOTION on deep acne to spot treat and prevent. Works great!!</li>
    <li> I am able to use this product every other day currently due to my sensitive skin.  It has already improved my acne after one week without excessive drying.  I do notice that it burns for about 5 minutes after I apply the lotion, especially if I get it to near my under eye area.  I am also moderately red later  in the day(around 1200) after application  at 6am.  This does not reside until late evening but I am hoping this will improve as I get used to the benzoyl peroxide.</li>
    <li> I have had clear skin since taking Accutane in 1997.  Then suddenly last year, my acne problem reoccurred with a vengeance.  I had tried oral and topical prescriptions, glycolic acid peels, Murad, Proactive, sulfur, zinc, and many more over the counter things.  Nothing seemed to work and out of desperation I was going to take Accutane again.  It had gotten so bad that I was embarrassed to go out in public.  I don’t usually wear foundation but I started to coat my face with it and it still didn’t hide all the acne and scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A co-worker brought in some of the Obaji Therapeutic Lotion for me to sample.  I tried it and the tingling (borderline burning) sensation scared me a little.  I only used a little but the tingling result was immediate.  I admit I was a little nervous but it goes away quickly and the more you use this stuff, the lesser the tingling becomes.  Though, I felt the product was working because I was actually feeling it.  It leaves your skin very dry so I started using Ponds dry skin moisturizer.  I also use Murad acne cleanser as my face wash.  I have been using this for over a month now, twice a day with the Murad face wash and my skin is CLEAR!!!  I have a few pimples still but before using this product about 50% of my face was covered in ance.  I am SOOOO glad I used this product.  I will not live without it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a miracle product!!!  If you have severe acne, you must try this.  You have absolutely nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. it&#x27;s something that I can&#x27;t go without. it&#x27;s a must have for those who have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Ever since I used this product, I never had breakouts anymore.  I am very satisfied with this product. Love it.</li>
    <li> How I started on Clenziderm?&lt;br /&gt;I was waiting for a package from Amazon and lo and behold the delivery man delivered the wrong package. In it was the Clenziderm Pore Therapy bottle. As strange as it is, it was my numerical number bu a different name. i had no clue the person was. Since I had adult acne then, I decided to use the bottle. IT WORKED (to my surprise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Therapeutic Lotion &amp; Soap&lt;br /&gt;Since the pore therapy worked.  I looked it up online and saw that there were two more products to the package. I ordered the cleaning bottle and used it with the pore therapy. IT WORKED EVEN BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this Therapeutic lotion along with the other two. I did not see any enhancements so I just stopped using it. I bought this lotion about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;A week ago, I saw the bottle and didn&#x27;t want to throw it away because 1) it was hard to find - always out of stock 2) it was expensive. So I started using it again and now IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;So, with the Pore Therapy and the Cleaning soap and another product I use (acne&#x3D;scars so the other product is to lighten the scars) my skin was doing good but adding this lotion makes it look better - Skin is smoother, I believe it helps with everything : pores reductions, acne scars, even tone ....&lt;br /&gt;If you have been battling any kind of acne, you know your skin. One other reason why I decide to use it too is because I thought my skin was &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; enough to accept the product now and it did.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot - Pore therepy and this Lotion should work... The soap really cleans the oil from your skin if you have oily skin hence why I use it</li>
    <li> I love Obagi products! They work so well! I have oily skin and frequently get breakouts. Putting this on the breakout area a couple times, clears it right up!</li>
    <li> Just using this lotion alone (without the wash or toner) keeps my face clear. It works very well but buyer beware it will stain your bedding just like any benzo product.</li>
    <li> Having bought this product before, I searched for the best deal and found this one.  The product was as advertised, delivered in a timely manner adn the price was very fair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Have been using this for many years now. I recommend it for those with difficult skin. Enough said!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the 3-step cleanziderm system but I really liked the gel version (yellowish in color) that was discontinued for the third step. This lotion is still good but not as effective on my skin as the previous version. Nevertheless, I recommend the acne system including this lotion. I don&#x27;t use the lotion everyday since it tends to be very drying. I also use it on my back and it&#x27;s worked very well!</li>
    <li> I am using this product in conjunction with the Obagi ClenziDerm Foaming Wash for oily skin, so I cannot attribute my results entirely to one or the other. I&#x27;ve used them together: the cleanser twice a day and the lotion in the evening before bed time. Note: When I forgot to use the lotion, I noticed the wash alone didn&#x27;t have as much effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for about 6 weeks, and at this point my face is completely clear. I&#x27;ve had adult acne for years, and I go through stages where I&#x27;m clear, broken out, clear, broken out. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything, from $5 products to $100 dollar products, and I never stick to anything because it either never works or works temporarily and stops. Below is a detailed review, beyond the \\&quot;it cleared my face up!\\&quot; People who have suffered from acne generally need more detail than that to be convinced that a product works. So here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I began using this lotion (in conjunction with the wash), my face was pretty broken out (for me this means 5-10 zits). A week later, my face was much smoother. I had two small zits that I could feel if I run my hands over my face - these may be zits that would&#x27;ve surfaced anyway and sat there for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of use: My skin looked worse than it did before I began using the product. That wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, so I gave it more time...I think the product was encouraging my skin to purge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six weeks: Skin completely cleared up - even little zits I didn&#x27;t realize I had until the big ones dried up - GONE. My face is completely smooth to the touch. I do have post-acne pigmentation. Not sure if this product can help that though. That requires time and possibly a skin-bleaching product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to note that I like the clean smell of this wash. I like to have some scent, but no one wants a medicated scent - this is just...clean. It&#x27;s a blue-ish colored liquid - you only need a dime-sized amount, if that (I havea square-shaped face that may require more product than many people). It definitely makes my skin feel clean when I&#x27;m done. Note: I use a basic everything-free wash to remove my make-up. THEN I use the Obagi cleanser. It&#x27;s not that the cleanser won&#x27;t remove your make-up; a dermatologist taught me this trick a few years back. Use something cheap to remove your make-up....then follow up with your  more expensive cleanser and it will seep into your skin much better (and you can use a lot less of the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal to combination or oily skin, you should have no issues using this twice a day. Some people have said it dried their skin - perhaps if you have dry skin to begin with, yes. I&#x27;ve noticed minor drying, but I&#x27;d rather deal with that than acne. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef (hence the 4 stars) is that the pump to the bottle doesn&#x27;t function properly. Don&#x27;t throw out the cap that this product originally comes with - you&#x27;ll need it when the pump breaks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of obagi for years. It never lets me down. I suggest using the 3 step consistently to see results. Initial results are seen in the first 2 weeks. My only concern is that the toner leaves me shiny. But I use a colorscience brush to hide it</li>
    <li> Hi there,&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Obagi products on and off for years. I recently decided to add this to my skin regime. I want to let people know that although it is called lotion it definitely is not. Use this cream the same way you would use a strong retinal cream: Start slow! Start using it a few times a week and work your way up to using it once a day. I have mostly dry skin and this product definitely dries my skin out a little. The good news is that as soon as you put it on you can feel it starting to work! I would recommend as long as you use carefully.</li>
    <li> Best product line I have ever used for acne.... Including prescription medications, Very effective for treating acne prone skin. I like the dry skin combo the best</li>
