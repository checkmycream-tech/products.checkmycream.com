### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Fits perfectly well to my SpinBrush!</li>
      <li>Was very happy to find it via Amazon.</li>
      <li>Best spinbrush.</li>
      <li>great deal, thank you</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find replacement brush heads for the handle that perform just like the original brushes.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>These replacement brushes, and the Spin brush they go with are not quite as good at getting between teeth as the pointy Rotadent brush, but for me this is a better bang for the buck.</li>
      <li>I liked the brush</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
      <li>I love the softness of this brush.</li>
      <li>I love the polished feel of this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I use to complain about the price of Oral B&#x27;s brush&#x27;s, but they put a lot more effort into making them.</li>
      <li>Make my teeth feel very clean.</li>
      <li>Hope they&#x27;re still available when I need more.</li>
      <li>The strength of the motor isn&#x27;t as strong as the Oral-B.</li>
      <li>They fit and operate fine, but within two weeks, the heads begin to weaken and droop.  </li>
      <li>but now the manufacturer has changed the brush head design and it is huge.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, packaging ok, new in pack and works with handle...happy</li>
      <li>They are more compact and it&#x27;s easier to reach the back teeth.</li>
      <li>The first one didn&#x27;t go on straight, but is still useable.</li>
      <li>Very well time for me to reorder</li>
      <li>Almost decided on just getting a whole new appliance.  </li>
      <li>So I decided to supplement my dental hygiene practice with this particular brush.</li>
      <li>but if you have sensitive gums like I do and are used to a Rotadent, you should really try this out.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think that Rotadent is great, but the replacement brushes are, well, highway robbery.  </li>
      <li>Its bristles are soft like the Rotadent&#x27;s and longer than the Oral-B</li>
      <li>yours was the only place I could find these replacement heads for my spinbrush, and they were reasonable.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because it was supposed to be ultra soft.</li>
      <li>that was soft.</li>
      <li>My gums bleed when I use this one even though it is supposed to be ultra soft.</li>
      <li>I got the &amp;#34;SpinBrush Pro Sensitive Ultra Soft&amp;#34; because it was the only one with a round head that was available at the grocery store I was at.  </li>
      <li>Although they are very firm, they are the only ones I can find to fit my toothbrush</li>

    <li> Fits perfectly well to my SpinBrush! I have a rather small mouth..or so was told by my dentist &amp; hygienist. The regular adult-size toothbrush sometimes just doesn&#x27;t work too well for me. I was recommended by both of my dentist &amp; hygienist to try &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; toothbrush one time when I went in for an annual check-up. My hygienist specifically recommended me to try a round head one if possible. I got the &amp;#34;SpinBrush Pro Sensitive Ultra Soft&amp;#34; because it was the only one with a round head that was available at the grocery store I was at.  I&#x27;ve been using it since then! Love it! This two-heads replacement package is also at 2/3 of the retail price, which is a plus!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because it was supposed to be ultra soft. The brush is very small, it is hard to get enough tooth paste on it. I purchased it to replace another brush I had that was soft. My gums bleed when I use this one even though it is supposed to be ultra soft. I went back to using the one I had from before. I let the brush do the work and I don&#x27;t hold it tight against my gums or rub it back and forth. None of my other brushes, electric or hand held make my gums bleed.</li>
    <li> I bought the Spinbrush Pro so that I could put my toothbrush away in the cabinet and did not have to keep it plugged in on the bathroom counter. I liked the brush but I kept having to replace the entire thing when the brush got worn. I was very happy to find replacement brush heads for the handle that perform just like the original brushes.</li>
    <li> Wish these weren&#x27;t so hard to find.  They work well for my daughters with smaller mouths and braces.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> the only way to have an electric toothbrush for kids that is both affordable and does not require throwing the entire toothbrush away when the head is worn out -- please, Spinbrush, don&#x27;t stop making these small sized heads!</li>
    <li> Very well time for me to reorder</li>
    <li> This is such a convenience when traveling. My wife and I take just one electric brush with two elements, and don&#x27;t have to worry about voltage changes.</li>
    <li> Make my teeth feel very clean.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, packaging ok, new in pack and works with handle...happy</li>
    <li> yours was the only place I could find these replacement heads for my spinbrush, and they were reasonable. great deal, thank you</li>
    <li> Although they are very firm, they are the only ones I can find to fit my toothbrush and they work!</li>
    <li> It works with my arm and hammer handle and spinbrush handle</li>
    <li> These are harder to find than you&#x27;d think. These have only the round brush instead of the round spinning brush and the lower oscillating brush. They are more compact and it&#x27;s easier to reach the back teeth.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! The first one didn&#x27;t go on straight, but is still useable. Hope they&#x27;re still available when I need more.</li>
    <li> Works just almost as well as Rotadent at a fraction of the cost.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think that Rotadent is great, but the replacement brushes are, well, highway robbery.  These replacement brushes, and the Spin brush they go with are not quite as good at getting between teeth as the pointy Rotadent brush, but for me this is a better bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Received your replacement heads.  They fit and operate fine, but within two weeks, the heads begin to weaken and droop.  Too fragile, when I need a hard brush.&lt;br /&gt;R.S.</li>
    <li> These are becoming difficult to find. The reason I purchased the Spinbrush was for the simple ultra-compact head but now the manufacturer has changed the brush head design and it is huge. Get the small ones while you can - looks like they&#x27;re fading away.</li>
    <li> I am use to Oral B brushes,  and these do not come close to them.  I tend to brush my teeth hard, and these toothbrushes just don&#x27;t hold up.  After a couple of weeks the bristles bend &amp; stand out.  I use to complain about the price of Oral B&#x27;s brush&#x27;s, but they put a lot more effort into making them.</li>
    <li> Best spinbrush. I love the softness of this brush.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of trouble finding replacement brushes for my brush.  Almost decided on just getting a whole new appliance.  Was very happy to find it via Amazon.</li>

    <li> I have used a Rotadent toothbrush for 20 years (with a short pointy brush head) but it&#x27;s gotten very expensive to get replacement brush heads and the quality control on them is problematic. So I decided to supplement my dental hygiene practice with this particular brush. I think it&#x27;s fabulous! Its bristles are soft like the Rotadent&#x27;s and longer than the Oral-B I sometimes use so it&#x27;s easier to get behind my back teeth. The strength of the motor isn&#x27;t as strong as the Oral-B. If you&#x27;re used to the Oral-B you might find these bristles too soft and the brush not strong enough but if you have sensitive gums like I do and are used to a Rotadent, you should really try this out. These brush heads work with several of the handles, and are tough to find in store. But they&#x27;re a lot cheaper than the Rotadent brush heads. I just wish they were pointy! I start brushing with the Rotadent (without toothpaste), switch to this brush (with Sensodyne) and then finish with brown Listerine mouthwash.</li>
    <li> The only toothbrush I will use. It&#x27;s gotten wet and the batteries have died and I dry it off and replace the batteries and it keeps running. I love the polished feel of this toothbrush.</li>
