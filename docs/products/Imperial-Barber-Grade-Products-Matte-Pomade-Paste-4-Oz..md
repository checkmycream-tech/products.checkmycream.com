      <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The hold is just okay though</li>
      <li>I love the design of the package and I love Imperial hair products.</li>
      <li>One thing I would say is it takes a lot to be able to hold your hair in place—it&#x27;s medium/medium-high hold and rework-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slightly more &amp;#34;paste-y&amp;#34; and moveable than Fiber.</li>
      <li>Applies light and easy, looks great in the hair, gives good texture, but still looks natural.</li>
      <li>This is a great product if you want a decent hold but still want to run your fingers thru your hair.</li>

      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly for my fine (not coarse), medium length hair.</li>

      <li>so it&#x27;s really easy to get washed</li>
      <li>It works but it&#x27;s not as strong as I would like.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong and not oily.</li>
      <li>Amazing quality, it&#x27;s very matte, no gloss at all!</li>
      <li>Best thing is with a little water you can readjust if needed.</li>
      <li>It gives a good hold but one that can blow in the wind; it&#x27;s not stiff or crunchy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really nice cross between a pomade and a paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great with the right amount of hold.</li>
    <li> This on its own does a great job of controlling my wavy hair!  When my hair is longer (time for a haircut) mixed with a little gel (Dep) it keeps everything (the waves that turn into curls) loosely controlled without looking like a have &#x27;plastic&#x27; hair- or &#x27;gel head&#x27;.  Great product, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Husband and son love this product.  You only need very little.  Not sticky.  Lightweight.</li>
    <li> I have a strange obsession with looking for the best hair styling product (gel, wax, pomade, etc.) -- I think I finally found it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 months now, and this stuff is the best. With just a very small amount (about the size of an almond), it holds perfectly and makes my hair look thicker as well. It has a very light watermelon scent that disappears within 2 minutes, and the product washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it came in a tube instead of a jar.</li>
    <li> Imperial makes all sorts of pomade and this their No. 2 hold in scale of 1 to 4. Personally it&#x27;s perfect for me! I&#x27;ve tried all soprts of mousses, pomades and even hair gel, always hating the results until this. It smells great, provides matte finish (if you apply lots of it you can get it to shine a bit) and even a bit of volume to your hair. Also, even if you have medium length or long hair, it will last you at least 1 year (probably a lot more).</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you want a decent hold but still want to run your fingers thru your hair. Best thing is with a little water you can readjust if needed.</li>
    <li> fuking amazing it looks like my hair naturaly has volume so perfect would recommend to any one thick or thin hair</li>
    <li> A little shiny for a matte finish. Will not order again</li>
    <li> I am ordering this through Amazon but you can just as easily order this from their website directly.  I received a birthday gift that included a bunch of Imperial products related to shaving and grooming and included was a tub of their pomade.  My hair is straight and fine and not long - I&#x27;m in the Army so i have to keep it short; about an inch or less on the top.  Pomade isn&#x27;t for me for the aforementioned reasons so I usually use a paste or glue product because I do not need a shine or crunch that gel or mousse gives.  I absolutely LOVE this company&#x27;s products so I have no qualms about spending this amount of money as opposed to a small tub of Axe paste or something because it works!  You really don&#x27;t need a lot of the product at all in each application.  I usually have towel-dried hair, spread a nickel size amount in my fingers and run it through until the moisture evaporates.  It gives a good hold but one that can blow in the wind; it&#x27;s not stiff or crunchy.  I put on and take off head gear all throughout the day and the nice thing is that it doesn&#x27;t ruin the hair somehow!  And if it gets a little too flat on top a quick back and forth of the fingers in the hair and it&#x27;s back to normal.  The product is reactivated by water as well so a little bit of moisture and it becomes malleable again until it dries.  And it washes completely clean in the shower, no special shampoo or conditioner (as some of my previous glue products required).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is head and shoulders above any other product I&#x27;ve used and I will order it again when I run out.  I also HAVE to recommend the brand in general and you should do yourself a favor by visiting their website ([...]  All American made products to professional barber specifications.  There isn&#x27;t one single complaint on any of their products in the comments section and it is not a coincidence.  Their products smell good, work good, and are reasonably priced.  Plus I like the packaging - no need to pretend like I&#x27;m 17 again and that using a specific product will get me instant babe attention.d like I&#x27;m 17 again and that using a specific product will get me instant babe attention.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair crunchy/is not reworkable as promised. Not sure why this has such positive reviews. It is overpriced for what it provides, which is the same as a generic fiber from CVS. I thought it would be unique, but you&#x27;re better off going with L&#x27;Oreal or Garnier fiber as they provide the same hold, a better smell, and are a quarter of the price.</li>
    <li> Great product, as others have said product has come with a cheap plastic lid. The lid had cracked right down the center within three weeks, after the second time I crammed it into a suitcase for travel.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hold, smells great, not shiny, lasts ALL day, even on windy days. If your hair gets messed up, just comb it back and it will still hold.</li>
    <li> It took me years to find a pomade that I really like.  This imperial Barber Products Matte Pomade does a very good job.  It isn&#x27;t to sticky and it isn&#x27;t to shinny.</li>
    <li> Im only rating it a 3 because I personally did not like it. It does provide a hold and it washes off easily so that was a plus. My issue was that once it set, there is no running-your-fingers through your hair unless you want to get snagged and like a brittle feel. Probably my own misconception that this would hold my style and yet still feel as if I never put anything on.</li>
    <li> Received the item on time! Can&#x27;t wait for my boyfriend to try this product on his hair (:</li>
    <li> This product is the best i have tried so far. It holds my hair, it is not greasy at all and it has no shine finish so my hair looks natural.</li>
    <li> This has decent hold, but when I put enough it in, it dries hard and shiny, giving a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look, which is exactly what I didn&#x27;t want, and doesn&#x27;t match the &amp;#34;no shine&amp;#34; description.</li>
    <li> Finally, after years of trying one pomade after another I have found a great one that will work long term for me!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a very pleasant melon flavor, and the texture is just what I was looking and hoping for. It is not too sticky or thick, and spreads evenly without clumping up.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this pomade. It is also a very large container ( 5 oz. ) and so while it may seem pricey, you do get much more than the others out there.</li>
    <li> Excellent pomade! It holds my hair well even on a hot day, it smells great, and for the price the size is larger than I imagined. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great  product for light hold. Lasts all day just wish the scent was a little stronger.</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot, I especially appreciate the way it feels in my hair once dried -- it looks and feels as though I have no product in whatsoever. My only complaint is that it does not have as strong a hold as expected. I have very thick, non-compliant hair, and this does not quite have enough hold to last me all day.</li>
    <li> Great product but flakes in my hair. I like the Fiber Pomade more. Worth a shot if you recomb often.</li>
    <li> Holds well and not sticky.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I love the scent. I prefer the Classic Pomade by Imperial.</li>
    <li> After using Amazon for 5+ years, this is my first review. I&#x27;ve used a ton of matte pastes/clays/fibers/etc. This is the last one I&#x27;ll ever use. It gives me the fewest fly-always, and keeps it textured without making my blow-dried hair curl back up (SUPER thick curly hair). I cannot recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> Dries VERY quickly and is very gooey.  It gets the job done but your hair will be pretty stiff.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a huge fan of matte hair products as the shiny stuff just seems a little bit over-the-top.I also like the fact that this is water-based so it comes out your hair much easier with the shampooing. The hold is just okay though</li>
    <li> decent, not the best. dry&#x27;s quickly can be a bit crusty</li>
    <li> exactly as described..good hold with no shine..feels good quality too..will last you few months..good value for money with great results!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, but with the steep price, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again. It works well, but it leaves the hair stiff, which I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the clean cut Axe Pomade (purple label, I think) before I tried this stuff, and have since switched back to the Axe product for the reasons I listed above...Axe is $8, Imperial is $20. Both products have great styling control, but Axe leaves the hair soft, Imperial leaves the hair hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as an alternative to Redken working manuever and I find it to be a decent alternative.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love the design of the package and I love Imperial hair products. They perform nicely and helps me style my hair the way I want. The only problem with this product was delivery. I don&#x27;t know whether amazon or Imperial takes care of the shipping, but it came a day late and I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s matt. But doesn&#x27;t hold hair or give it the messy look you are looking for. It&#x27;s water based so it&#x27;s really easy to get washed</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I first picked it up at my barber but then they switched which products they carry, so I was very happy to find it here. I really like the matte finish, so your hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy or plastic and it has just the right amount of hold. I like that I can touch my hair throughout the day without getting my fingers sticky, which is more than most similar products can say. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t smell weird at all. You don&#x27;t need to use much to get good results so it&#x27;s totally worth the price too.</li>
    <li> Love this pomade. May seem like a lot of money for a small canister, but with pomade a little goes a very, very long way. Even when used daily, it will probably take at least a year to get through it all.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my previous hair product from Mitch (Paul Mitchell male line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it&#x27;s US made and it works well and as described.</li>
    <li> This is one of the first products I&#x27;ve purchased without trying it first, and I&#x27;m not disappointed. I have semi-thick, very straight, and somewhat short (although it depends on how lazy I am in going to the barber) hair.  From using American Crew Fiber to using gels and many other styling products, this pomade paste works very well. It&#x27;s slightly more &amp;#34;paste-y&amp;#34; and moveable than Fiber. One thing I would say is it takes a lot to be able to hold your hair in place—it&#x27;s medium/medium-high hold and rework-able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Smells good (almost like watermelon)&lt;br /&gt;Larger container, more bang for your buck&lt;br /&gt;Just the right amount of hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;Cannot be taken on a carry-on during flights (1oz. too large)&lt;br /&gt;Smell can be overwhelming if you&#x27;re looking for less of a fruit smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d purchase this again, but I&#x27;d like to find something that may be a little less heavy on my hair, but I do like it more than Fiber. So for now I&#x27;ll compromise and stick with it.</li>
    <li> It works but it&#x27;s not as strong as I would like. My hair isn&#x27;t overly long so I expected it to do the job.</li>
    <li> A little stiff compared to crew but definitely not as greasy. Smells nice as well.</li>
    <li> Holds extremely well. An excellent alternative to Imperial&#x27;s fantastic pomadw</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, greying curly hair.  I&#x27;ve blow-dried, straightened and hair-sprayed for years.  Tired of the fixed helmet look, I began looking for an easier, time-friendly alternative.  I happened upon this product and was immediately sold.  Only a little paste is necessary and frizz disappears.  Curls are enhanced and smoothed to a beautifully soft, manageable look and work time is about two minutes.  This is the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky about hair products, and I have to say that I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with this one. Applies light and easy, looks great in the hair, gives good texture, but still looks natural. No greasiness, no stiffness, no overwhelming odor. Does its job and does it well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product - gives great hold without that obnoxious shine.  A little pricier than your drugstore brands, but well worth the money spent in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Best hair product out there. If you want a structured look use more, if you want a messy look use less. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or leave it oily or flakey. Quality ingredients. American made. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this product works great!</li>
    <li> Best pomade i&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping. I like this one more than the sumotech. Has may hair looking thicker and with the low shine matte look I will buy more. Also the control is medium and if you add a little bit of water you can re style to your liking.</li>
    <li> Love how easily it is water activated! Would highly suggest!</li>
    <li> Really good quality for the cost</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Perfect hold with just a hint of shine.</li>
    <li> looks nice, smell good but i m not fan of low-medium hold...but it is matte ;)</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have used Imperial Classic Pomade, Imperial Fiber Pomade and the Gel Pomade for the past two years with no issues what so ever. I LOVE IMPERIAL! I recently purchased this Imperial Matte Pomade and loved that I could do the messy look when I cut my hair short, versus the other Imperial products that I use when it&#x27;s longer. (Long hair with pomade in the summer when you live in Arizona, sucks.) The negative thing about this Matte Pomade is that after 3 days of use, it made me break out in painful bumps all around my hair line and on my scalp. It&#x27;s no big deal, I still love this line, I just won&#x27;t be using the matte formula anymore. It washes out great, just like the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly hair and when I use the typical classic pomade from the barber, it&#x27;s just like Vaseline and it doesn&#x27;t come out. It&#x27;s gross. I also notice that when I style my hair with the typical barber pomade, way too much hair falls out because I have to tug. With Imperial products, they glide through my hair and straighten it out so that my styles stay in all day until I wash it out at night. Seriously these ARE the best products that I have ever used in my hair and I will continue to buy religiously.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair.  This product doe a great job of keeping my mop in place from the time of a haircut until about 2.5-3 weeks of growth.  After that, I need to use a thicker product with more hold to coerce my hair into looking decent.  Since I get my hair cut about every 4 weeks, this works well for the most part, and I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crusty or hard.  And it&#x27;s easy to re-activate and restyle my hair at any time throughout the day.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s strong and not oily.</li>
    <li> I heard about this stuff from a barber I follow on Instagram actually, Anthonythebarber. First off, go check his stuff out. Second, if you are looking for a great matte pomade paste, order this. It will by far exceed your expectations. I have been on the hunt for a good matte pomade for some time now and have tried SO MANY products and have never been happy with any of them. Imperial is doing it right! This product also has a nice fresh scent. I will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Been using it for a year and it works great! Nice texture. Great hold. Not shine. No flaking.&lt;br /&gt;Imperial is the real deal!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! My husband uses it on his undercut hair style. Keeps it back without the wet look, which make it look more like he&#x27;s achieving it without the product (if only ;)) . It&#x27;s kind of like the no makeup makeup look, only for guys and their hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Lasts so long! Amazing quality, it&#x27;s very matte, no gloss at all!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my hair. Extremely reliable, holds in pretty well even after a long period of time (5 hours plus) and smells amazing when opening.</li>
    <li> Great product however it does not come as pictured.  As pictured, it has a metal/tin cap.  the one that came to my door had a cheap plastic black cap.. you&#x27;re better of purchasing from your local barber shop to make sure your item comes as pictured</li>
    <li> Great job for water based. good hold, looks nice, and doesnt stink</li>
    <li> Bought it because of another review saying it&#x27;s good for fine hair, however my hair starts to friz at the end of the day.  Back to the original for me.... :(</li>
    <li> not hard enough since it is a level 2 for matte finish pomade. but i dont want to get shiny finish on my hair. the smell are good!</li>
    <li> I float between rocking a pomp and just having a tousled look. This works for both, especially the latter.&lt;br /&gt;The smell before it dries is like a watermelon Jolly Rancher. Rinses out easy.&lt;br /&gt;Couldnt be happier.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. At first I was slightly hesitant to pay the price for such a small size, but the reviews convinced me otherwise, and they have held true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need is about a fingertip&#x27;s worth of pomade for your entire head. Applied to wet hair, you can achieve any style you want. If you leave it alone, it will give your hair a wet look, but if you run your hand through it one time, the sheen goes away, but the hold stays. This was a huge plus for me, because I like being able to style my hair without looking like I put any effort into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought Imperial paste twice now, and I don&#x27;t picture myself ever buying a different brand. Do yourself a favor and invest in this. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd one, going to keep buying it. Great smell and very easy to put on. Also stays on, as long as you don&#x27;t constantly play with your hair, all day.</li>
    <li> Works well for multiple applications and hairstyles.  If I am looking for something light and feathery, I can use a minimal amount.  If I want to really slick my hair back, I can use a lot.  Has good hold and shaping characteristics and doesn&#x27;t smell terrible.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have fine hair and works great !! Washes off easy from hands. Nice scent.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t possibly buy anything else since I used this one...Just great!</li>
    <li> Solid product. Cleans up very easily with water and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the head. This is the best pommade I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
    <li> I have normal to fine hair, and it is thinning in the very front and this pomade worked perfectly! Gives volume and the matte finish is exactly what I needed. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I need some product that holds my hair in place without looking slicked back or being rock hard. I want to run my fingers through it occasionally.  This is the stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and my hair looks and feels natural.  Love it.  It works perfectly for my fine (not coarse), medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. My hair is medium length Pompadour. After a shower, I do not dry my hair. I rub a finger across the pomade, rub my hands together to spread it and run my hands through wet hair. I comb my hair and let it dry naturally while I shave and dress. My hair holds well throughout the day and is not stiff or greasy. If required, a little water on a comb is all it takes to restyle. I will skip washing my hair for a day if I do not exercise or otherwise sweat  and a wet comb is all it takes in the morning.</li>
    <li> A really great pomade that does not flake. I wear it day to day, and I am extremely happy with the quality. This may seem pricey, but the quality of this pomade makes up for it. Plus, there is a huge amount and you will not run out any time soon. It has a pleasant watermelon-esque smell and is very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Great product, will definitely buy again. I use a small portion daily, holds in place over 10 hours and People can&#x27;t tell I use anything in my hair (which is why I got matte)</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair that gets thick and wavy as it grows longer. I had been trying to find a product that left a true no-shine finish for years, and this nails it. I have tried many brands, including Baxter of California clay pomade and hard cream pomade (which is second best to this for my hair type), American Crew light hold gel, fiber, and grooming cream (each product never really worked - too much hold or shine), and Teddy Boy Matte wax (a bit too much shine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t have the hold of clay (like Baxter of California&#x27;s clay pomade), but it leaves a truly matte finish with manageable hair and light hold. If you add water to your hair during the day, you can fix your hair up and it will go back to matte when it dries. If you need more hold, I would lean toward the Baxter of California hard cream pomade. Otherwise, so glad I found this stuff. My hair stays manageable in windy conditions, seems to stay static free, and most importantly, does not leave any shine.</li>
