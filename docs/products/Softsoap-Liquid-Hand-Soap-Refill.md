<li> That was annoying.</li>

    <li> I purchased this item primarily because of its value.  However, it also great soap.  Beats buying in bulk at a store.</li>

    <li> We have used this brand from Softsoap for many years.  We have tried other, cheaper alternatives, but have not been happy.  This particular brand from this manufacturer does not cause redness and irritation, like some of the other scents. We wash our hands a lot, because we have a lot of pets, so we need something that is mild and hopefully has a nice scent.  This brand and this scent fits the bill just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can likely get a better deal by shopping around. A recent price for a Softsoap refill at Target (on sale) is $4.15 for 56 oz. If you use your Target Redcard that is another 5% off, or $3.94.  Comparing the storebrand at Walmart, I found that it was not any cheaper--$3.97 for 56 oz.  So, waiting for the product on sale at Target, for example, seems to be a good strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s an interesting tidbit about Aloe Vera:  Thousands of years ago, the ancient Egyptians called Aloe Vera the &amp;#34;plant of immortality&amp;#34;. They held the plant in such high regard, that they honored their deceased pharaohs with a burial gift of this!  (Aloe vera, I mean, not Softsoap!)  Well, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really the &amp;#34;plant of immortality,&amp;#34; but we like it for our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested, the manufacturer lists these ingredients. Probably not actually much aloe vera, since it&#x27;s way down the list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Water&lt;br /&gt;* Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate&lt;br /&gt;* Laureth-3&lt;br /&gt;* Cocamidopropyl Betaine&lt;br /&gt;* Glycol Stearate&lt;br /&gt;* Sodium Chloride&lt;br /&gt;* Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;* Polyquaternium-7&lt;br /&gt;* DMDM Hydantoin&lt;br /&gt;* Citric Acid&lt;br /&gt;* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice&lt;br /&gt;* Tetrasodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt;* Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;* Poloxamer 124&lt;br /&gt;* Hydrolyzed Silk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in other liquid soap products with Aloe Vera or similar ingredients, you might try these, but some are much more expensive:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002AMUI8A Nature&#x27;s Gate Aloe Vera Velvet Moisture Liquid Soap, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00005302X Dial  Liquid Hand Soap With Moisturizer, Aloe, 7.5-Oz.

    <li> I saw a few reviews about packaging issues- bottles opened and creating messes during shipping- and decided to take my chances... WOW... Opened up a royal mess, at least the box with the soap was inside another box, but the caps were unscrewed on three bottles and the box  was coated with soap.  All in all I only lost about 1/3 of a bottle.  Just be prepared for a little cleanup when your package arrives...</li>
    <li> it is sometimes difficult to shop on line, because you can only view items from pictures, and what you thought would be the actual size is indeed not.  however i can find anything i need at amazon</li>
    <li> Finally a refill soap that is truly moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  Nice scent, although not strong. The white color matches everything too. So you can put into any soap pump dispenser that matches your decor.</li>
    <li> I like this brand. I do not use antibacterial soaps and this is one of the few pump soaps left that aren&#x27;t antibacterial.  My husband has contact lenses and he needs a soap that rinses very clean.  This softsoap with aloe works for both of those concerns.  For a family of just the pack of 6 lasts 6 months or more with 3 bathrooms and a dispenser in each.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Will buy here as long as it is offered :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It has a surprisingly relaxing scent - strong but not overpowering. I got the moisturizing Aloe. One thing I usually hate about soap is how dry it leaves my skin. Not this liquid soap. It leaves my hands hydrated. Also, it&#x27;s thick, which is a good thing for my bathroom soap dispenser. The soap I was using before was really thin and would drip from the dispenser after use, leaving soap residue on and around the dispenser. That was annoying. Because of the thickness of this soap, it doesn&#x27;t do that anymore. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for a while, and is a family favorite. The large refill bottle allows for a cost-effective way to use the product.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap. I am glad I could get refills.</li>
    <li> gets hands clean, fresh smell, and we use it all over our house to fill our soap containers. really appreciate the size and amount.</li>
    <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> I bought these refills so I can use them instead of buying soap weekly.  I used to work in the ER so i have a habit of washing my hands excessively, and this soap is great for keeping hands moist while sanitizing them</li>
    <li> The soap itself is normal as to be expected but the caps were not screwed on tight so my my shipping box had soap all over it. I feel I lost my extra value from buying in bulk due to the loss of a few ounces of soap from each bottle</li>
    <li> this is high quality soap, not expired or weird.  much cheaper to use this than to keep buying new pumps.</li>
