<ol>

      <li>Wonderful for work outs !!  </li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>am still using it on every trips and it is still working out great for me.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t fly without it.</li>
      <li>neck felt great afterwards...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the inflatable ones and the bean filled ones and this one works best and is easier to pack.</li>
      <li>Used it on a 10 hr flight and I loved it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was looking for an easy to carry, yet effective way to sleep en route, and this was the perfect solution.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>There are also better ways to keep your  neck warm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by far the best neck support I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very comfortable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping my wife likes hers as she had a C2 fracture many years ago</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as supportive as I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I may take some practices before you can find what is comfortable yet effective for support for you.  </li>
      <li>This is much better.</li>
      <li>When you put it on, make sure to stretch (elongate)</li>
      <li>But my posture also could be better.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll see if it works for her :)</li>
      <li>It is more supportive than the foam collars, and much more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>She was able to put it on easily and felt immediate support.  </li>
      <li>For me it was a good purchase at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Return policy was easy with Amazon though.</li>
      <li>works great and it looks much better than the bulky white neck collars.  </li>
      <li>Recommended for travel and office, easy to carry</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t fit my neck</li>
      <li>It is very useful, light to wear and to carry in a flight.</li>
      <li>I love this caldera collar because the smaller size fits so much better, is more comfortable, and is not so &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; looking.  </li>
      <li>I find this to offer great added support and comfort for me when sitting for long periods at the computer, watching television and on airline flights.</li>
      <li>Easy to pack and works better than the more available back of neck pillows.</li>
      <li>My neck hurts mostly due to not being able to find a good pillow.</li>
      <li>My 98 year old mother-in-law uses it to relieve her neck problems; to hold up her head more easily.</li>
      <li>but this has been a tremendous help in everything I do ...</li>
      <li>i just kept right on sleeping...</li>
      <li>It also makes driving and sitting for long periods of time more comfortable.</li>
      <li>works pretty good to keep your head from bobbing up and down on a plane as you doze off.</li>
      <li>Even then I wouldn&#x27;t count on it to do very much.</li>
      <li>Nothing ever helped this much before in two years!</li>
      <li>During the summer, it get too hot; but this helps a lot.</li>
      <li>the only thing is that it does get a big warm but if you do some smart positioning of the air vent, so it doesnt blast you right in the face, but can deliver some cool air your way, it seemed to keep that warmth at bay.</li>
      <li>The great part is that unlike other braces especially those made for patients with whiplash, etc ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just not so soft.</li>
      <li>this is easy to wash but less comfortable than the one I bought for $10.  </li>
      <li>This is a handy little device to use when flying.  </li>
      <li>I am a Physical Therapist of over 20 years &amp; now recommending this product over the typical neck brace to so many of my patients !!  </li>
      <li>so make sure to put your hair up completely while you are putting it on, then  make sure that the female velcro surface completely covers the male velcro surface, so it will not catch your hair.</li>
      <li>Amazing how the neck can adjust the entire back alignment.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
      <li>Not as much neck support as I was hoping, but</li>
      <li>It washes and dries very well.</li>
      <li>Much easier to use than neck pillows.  </li>
      <li>and it supports very well while bending and turning.  </li>
      <li>I use it to keep my neck straight while sleeping.  </li>
      <li>It is advertised for sleeping on planes, but it also works real well when I fall asleep in the recliner.  </li>
      <li>Holds my head up comfortably and is small and compact, easy to pack in carry on.</li>
      <li>absolutely did the job of keeping my head up, keeping my neck straight and keeping my mouth shut so that i wasnt drooling all over me or my poor sardined neighbor... very lightweight, very comfortable, easily to clip to your purse or jamming it anyplace into your carry on luggage.</li>
      <li>I bought this for computer use or while sitting in chair and caused more pain due to immobility of neck which needs to move so muscles do not tighten.  </li>
      <li>Bought a second one for her, so she always has a clean one to use.</li>
      <li>Obviously it needs to be secure and tight to be supportive, but it wasn&#x27;t something that I could wear with any level of comfort</li>
      <li>I like to sleep while traveling in car or plane, and usually end with a stiff neck, but this has worked great!</li>
      <li>I do wish they would make it in a natural skin color, but if you immerse it in some warm water and squeeze it out a few times before wearing, the darker color won&#x27;t run on your neck.  </li>
      <li>This collar would work to keep your neck warm, but support is minimal unless you have an extremely short neck.</li>
      <li>I believe it is too high, and needs to adjust more easily slightly below the neck.  </li>
      <li>It is a little more rigid than the plush, but I recently flew a red eye, and I was able to fall asleep sitting up</li>
      <li>highly recommend this stuff.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Too high for a normal neck.</li>
      <li>The fit is too wide for my mom to wear.  </li>
      <li>I am actually wearing this support right at this moment to support my neck while on the computer.  </li>
      <li>IF Put on CORRECTLY,  it will support your neck even with conditions which require PT interventions or that ugly neck brace prescribed by MD or recommended by PT, so much more effectively, comfortably &amp; fashionably !!  </li>
      <li>Sounded like a good idea, but the regular size did not fit my very petite mother who is only 5 foot 3 and 100 pounds.  </li>
      <li>Fairly comfortable, I have used this several times, I am a short person</li>
      <li>I gave the first one to my friend and the second one to my sister.</li>
      <li>(something I&#x27;ve never been able to do in the past) and wake up without neck pain.</li>
      <li>I have herniated disks and spinal stenosis in the cervical spine and get muscle spasms and tiredness from supporting my neck for too long.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too soft to support the head.</li>
      <li>We all know that unless you are in first class you&#x27;ll never get a seat to recline enough anymore to actually have a restful nap</li>
      <li>Not sure who it would fit.</li>
      <li>the knowledge I&#x27;ve accumulated after talking to many other people has shown that neck problems are highly individualized and that there is hardly any product that works for everyone.</li>
      <li>It is soft but sufficiently firm to lift her head higher and rest her weakened muscles.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is a little difficulty adjusting it to the sweet spot between feeling like your getting choked and having enough support.</li>
      <li>used this on a flight not long ago..</li>
      <li>The first few minutes I wore it, I could already feel my body getting back in posture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it would provide enough support to support your head fully during travel, but it will keep your mouth closed, which is as important.</li>
      <li>it seems&amp;#34; a little long in the neck&amp;#34;, but overall pretty comfy.</li>

<li> Because of long standing neck problems I purchased the Caldera Neck Rest.  </li>
<li> I have a small neck which really surprised me</li>
<li> Due to my mistake of not looking hard enough I received the soft nylon pillow.</li>
<li> When you nap your head doesn&#x27;t fall forward and your mouth remains closed and prevents embarrassing drooling.</li>
<li> I had been wearing a conventional white foam neck collar for several months, but it looked awkward, and they only came in one size that was too big for my neck.  </li>
<li> This one does NOT make your neck sweaty or itchy due to sweat ... since it does wicks moisture away from the skin ...</li>
<li> It is a big help when on the computer where there is a tendency to have poor posture especially when it comes to your neck.</li>
<li> It has a piece of hard plastic (or something) around the middle on the inside that helps keep it from collapsing like some of the foam braces do.  </li>
<li> I think it is a tad too tight making it not real comfortable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The fit is too wide for my mom to wear.  It is for a longer neck.</li>
    <li> I have a small neck and find that i should have ordered the large. I Read the reviews but I thought medium would work.</li>
    <li> The wrap was so tall that I felt like I was constantly stretching my neck to keep from choking myself.  Obviously it needs to be secure and tight to be supportive, but it wasn&#x27;t something that I could wear with any level of comfort and so it got returned.</li>
    <li> I have had neck/disk surgery and fusion of my C1 &amp; C2 cervical neck disks.  I use this brace when I do gardening or house work and it supports very well while bending and turning.  It has a piece of hard plastic (or something) around the middle on the inside that helps keep it from collapsing like some of the foam braces do.  It is advertised for sleeping on planes, but it also works real well when I fall asleep in the recliner.  Doesn&#x27;t let my head fall forward, so the back of my neck is not being strained, which helps to relieve spasms.  I do wish they would make it in a natural skin color, but if you immerse it in some warm water and squeeze it out a few times before wearing, the darker color won&#x27;t run on your neck.  It washes and dries very well. This is my 3rd Caldera collar.  One I wear a lot, the 2nd is a backup, and the 3rd is in my emergency/bug out bag just in case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as supportive as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I am actually wearing this support right at this moment to support my neck while on the computer.  It has helped with my neck discomfort and to prevent for discomfort and maintain proper alignment I wear it while on the computer and at times while lying on the the couch watching TV.  The support is essentially serving it&#x27;s purpose to prevent and relieve neck and shoulder pain.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little device to use when flying.  It takes little space in my underseat bag and does the job.  Only complaint is that the company sent the wrong color.</li>
    <li> This collar would work to keep your neck warm, but support is minimal unless you have an extremely short neck. Even then I wouldn&#x27;t count on it to do very much. There are also better ways to keep your  neck warm. I purchased this to try with one of my PT clients and decided to return it immediately.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an easy to carry, yet effective way to sleep en route, and this was the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> I personally could not sleep on the plan using it. My husband got one and it worked for him though. I bought it because we were going to be on two 10+ hour flights and I was hoping to get some sleep - no luck!</li>
    <li> Fairly comfortable, I have used this several times, I am a short person and I do not have a long neck, so it seems&amp;#34; a little long in the neck&amp;#34;, but overall pretty comfy.I like to sleep while traveling in car or plane, and usually end with a stiff neck, but this has worked great! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s too soft to support the head.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it.  The only drawback is a little difficulty adjusting it to the sweet spot between feeling like your getting choked and having enough support.</li>
    <li> My neck hurts mostly due to not being able to find a good pillow. But my posture also could be better. I received this today and put it on for about 30 min and noticed the change (albeit temporary) in my posture and neck alignment. I&#x27;m hoping my wife likes hers as she had a C2 fracture many years ago but now it is causing her chronic pain. We&#x27;ll see if it works for her :)</li>
    <li> no support.  wayyyyyyyyyyy too mushy.  how can this support your head if its not rigid enough? unless you have a pea head</li>
    <li> It is very useful, light to wear and to carry in a flight. I tried the usual travel pillow. This is much better. Love it!</li>
    <li> it is not a  medical neck brace, however I use it as such...I have to wear a brace at all times and those white bulky things are so ugly. Now I wish they&#x27;d come in different colors :and sizes,</li>
    <li> Because of long standing neck problems I purchased the Caldera Neck Rest.  It has met my expectations. It can be used anytime&lt;br /&gt;and not just on plane flights. It is a big help when on the computer where there is a tendency to have poor posture especially when it comes to your neck. For me it works best on plane flights. When you nap your head doesn&#x27;t fall forward and your mouth remains closed and prevents embarrassing drooling. We all know that unless you are in first class you&#x27;ll never get a seat to recline enough anymore to actually have a restful nap so this item works well for me. I should point out that after dealing with neck problems for 25 yrs. the knowledge I&#x27;ve accumulated after talking to many other people has shown that neck problems are highly individualized and that there is hardly any product that works for everyone. You just have to try this product to see if it works for you. For me it was a good purchase at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Much easier to use than neck pillows.  I&#x27;ve used the inflatable ones and the bean filled ones and this one works best and is easier to pack.</li>
    <li> Not as much neck support as I was hoping, but I still like this product.</li>
    <li> Works great! Holds my head up comfortably and is small and compact, easy to pack in carry on. Have bought 4 for gifts</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit and I tend to lose my neck pillows. I immediately went to Amazon to replace this one after I lost it. It&#x27;s by far the best neck support I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Mother.  She has degenerative everything.  She was able to put it on easily and felt immediate support.  I tried it on myself and felt the same thing.  I&#x27;m not sure it would provide enough support to support your head fully during travel, but it will keep your mouth closed, which is as important.</li>
    <li> I found this uncomfortable and my neck hurt after using it.  I believe it is too high, and needs to adjust more easily slightly below the neck.  I would never wear it on an airplane flight.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t fly without it. It also makes driving and sitting for long periods of time more comfortable. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used it on a 10 hr flight and I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~UPDATE~&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it on every trips and it is still working out great for me.</li>
    <li> Easy to pack and works better than the more available back of neck pillows.</li>
    <li> Must - to - have in long travel time. I gave the first one to my friend and the second one to my sister. I&#x27;ll buy another one for myself again.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t fit my neck i am a small person, feels like i am choking</li>
    <li> During the summer, it get too hot; but this helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I am a Physical Therapist of over 20 years &amp; now recommending this product over the typical neck brace to so many of my patients !!  IF Put on CORRECTLY,  it will support your neck even with conditions which require PT interventions or that ugly neck brace prescribed by MD or recommended by PT, so much more effectively, comfortably &amp; fashionably !!  I myself got in an auto accident and suffering from severe neck condition ... but this has been a tremendous help in everything I do ... from driving, reading, writing, cooking, doing the dishes,  and even exercising !!!  The great part is that unlike other braces especially those made for patients with whiplash, etc ... This one does NOT make your neck sweaty or itchy due to sweat ... since it does wicks moisture away from the skin ... Wonderful for work outs !!  When you put it on, make sure to stretch (elongate) your neck farthest without looking up, then put this on evenly and FIRMLY yet SNUGLY put it on.  I may take some practices before you can find what is comfortable yet effective for support for you.  If you have a long or medium length hair, the velcro will catch it ... so make sure to put your hair up completely while you are putting it on, then  make sure that the female velcro surface completely covers the male velcro surface, so it will not catch your hair.</li>
    <li> I have herniated disks and spinal stenosis in the cervical spine and get muscle spasms and tiredness from supporting my neck for too long.  I find this to offer great added support and comfort for me when sitting for long periods at the computer, watching television and on airline flights.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a small person (5&#x27;, 105 lbs) and this was pretty uncomfortable. My head still wobbles front and back. I ended up getting myself another neck pillow for the trip home.</li>
    <li> No more stiff neck snoozing upright !</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this product . I have had neck issues for 32 years. I think it is a tad too tight making it not real comfortable. I have a small neck which really surprised me that is it too tight.</li>
    <li> Helped align the overall posture of my back and neck.. Nothing ever helped this much before in two years! Not even my physiotherapist. The first few minutes I wore it, I could already feel my body getting back in posture. It&#x27;s also very comfortable. Amazing how the neck can adjust the entire back alignment.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> Before, it&#x27;s hard for me to do my project because I can not stand the pain on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have this Caldera releaf neck, it helps my neck a lot and it&#x27;s not aching anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> used this on a flight not long ago.. absolutely did the job of keeping my head up, keeping my neck straight and keeping my mouth shut so that i wasnt drooling all over me or my poor sardined neighbor... very lightweight, very comfortable, easily to clip to your purse or jamming it anyplace into your carry on luggage. i actually brought a scarf and used it to over my head so i get some shut eye and the flight attendent did not wake in order to know if i wanted the bag of 5 mini pretzels snacks... i just kept right on sleeping... neck felt great afterwards... the only thing is that it does get a big warm but if you do some smart positioning of the air vent, so it doesnt blast you right in the face, but can deliver some cool air your way, it seemed to keep that warmth at bay.</li>
    <li> works great and it looks much better than the bulky white neck collars.  Recommended for travel and office, easy to carry</li>
    <li> this is easy to wash but less comfortable than the one I bought for $10.  I use it to keep my neck straight while sleeping.  Too high for a normal neck. Not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for computer use or while sitting in chair and caused more pain due to immobility of neck which needs to move so muscles do not tighten.  I have a lot of neck issues so this turned out not to be for me.  Return policy was easy with Amazon though.</li>
    <li> I have long term neck issues, weakness, herniated discs, and arthritis.  I had been wearing a conventional white foam neck collar for several months, but it looked awkward, and they only came in one size that was too big for my neck.  I love this caldera collar because the smaller size fits so much better, is more comfortable, and is not so &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; looking.  Several people have thought I just have a scarf around my neck.  It is more supportive than the foam collars, and much more comfortable.  I plan to order another one soon. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My 98 year old mother-in-law uses it to relieve her neck problems; to hold up her head more easily. It is soft but sufficiently firm to lift her head higher and rest her weakened muscles. Bought a second one for her, so she always has a clean one to use. They are machine washable, too, but I do not put in dryer.</li>
    <li> Way too small.  Sounded like a good idea, but the regular size did not fit my very petite mother who is only 5 foot 3 and 100 pounds.  Not sure who it would fit.</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because I thought I was buying the pillow with plush covering. Due to my mistake of not looking hard enough I received the soft nylon pillow. It&#x27;s not bad, just not so soft. It is a little more rigid than the plush, but I recently flew a red eye, and I was able to fall asleep sitting up (something I&#x27;ve never been able to do in the past) and wake up without neck pain.</li>
    <li> works pretty good to keep your head from bobbing up and down on a plane as you doze off.</li>
