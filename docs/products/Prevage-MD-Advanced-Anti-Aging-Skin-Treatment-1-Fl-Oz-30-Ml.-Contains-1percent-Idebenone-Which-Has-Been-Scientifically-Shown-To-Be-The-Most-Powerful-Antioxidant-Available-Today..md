    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years and it has kept my skin looking great.</li>
    <li> i love this will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely, positively one think I can&#x27;t live without. I use daily under sunscreen for last 3 years. I have tried other stuff, but nothing makes my skin look so smooth and radiant.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Far exceeds Prevage sold in department stores. You are wasting your money not buying md grade. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This really is the best skin treatment ever, it contains 1 percent idebenone which is the strongest and most powerful environmental protector on the market it preserves your skin from environmental damage by 95 percent that&#x27;s like wearing a helmet. The only problem is mine got stopped by customs and I had to pay an additional £18 so it does work out rather expensive but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best! Have been using it for close to 6 years and I can&#x27;t find a substitute for it!</li>
    <li> I Use allergan prevage every night. It has made my skin smoother and refreshed looking.Amazon pprovides this product at a very competitive price</li>
    <li> Yes, it really does lift and firm.  However, be careful not to apply too much, only a small amount is needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with good delivery</li>
    <li> Have been a Prevage MD user for a some of years.  When the 40 somethings are asking what I use on my 60 something skin, that pretty much says it all. I use it every morning.  Well worth the price.  Buy 2 at a time so you don&#x27;t run out.  It is difficult to know exactly when the container will be empty.  No visable clue.&lt;br /&gt;CJF-Houston, TX</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging and I liked the product, especially the shiny sheen when I put it on during the day</li>
    <li> Prevage is an awesome product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never change the formulation.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a quality product for your face look no farther.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference been using for 4 months</li>
    <li> Love this product so much - wish they would make it without the parabens etc.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price.</li>
    <li> Pump didn&#x27;t work, and container seems empty.  It worked twice, and now nothing.  I am returning it and have ordered again.  Has anyone else had this problem?  This is not a complaint about what I was able to use.  I will update this review when I receive the new product (I only wrote this to see if anyone else has had a problem with the package).</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my Dermatologist as follow-up care after IPL treatment. Very happy with the product. A little goes a long way. This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Loved this product for years</li>
    <li> Item was delivered as promised and was as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It significantly improves the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> i have brown skin and this makes my face looks ghostly, i would much rather spending my money on doctor perricone&#x27;s products</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years now.  My daughter works for a cosmetic surgeon and recommended Prevage MD.  The first time I tried it I saw results - fine lines in the cheeks and forehead area significantly lessened.  I use it every day now.  It has decreased in price and is affordable. I think you will find a great improvement in fine lines and wrinkles. Make sure it is PrevageMD, and not just Prevage though.</li>
    <li> If this is the real deal, then it&#x27;s quite a bargain.</li>
