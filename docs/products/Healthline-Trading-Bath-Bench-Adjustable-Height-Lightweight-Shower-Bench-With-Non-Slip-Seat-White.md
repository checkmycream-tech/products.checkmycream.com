      <li>We&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it&#x27;s been great.</li>

      <li>It didn&#x27;t fit my tub.</li>
      <li>Light weight shower chair</li>
      <li>It is also light weight.  </li>
      <li>I WAS ABLE TO ADJUST IT TO THE RIGHT HEIGHT.</li>
      <li>SUPER easy to put together</li>
      <li>excellent value and works well in a small shower unit</li>
      <li>He couldn&#x27;t stand for very long so this seat worked great for the shower.</li>
      <li>Solid, good grips on the bottom of the legs, stable and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Assembly was super easy and quick, as well as the height adjustment.</li>
      <li>It is sturdy, comfortable, and very reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>Right size for sitting &amp; right size to fit the shower.</li>
      <li>It holds either of us solidly (both 250 lbs +), doesn&#x27;t slip and fits nicely in our tub (granted, we have a roman bath-style tub).</li>
      <li>Goes together initially with a little force to get things aligned, but perfect after assembly.  </li>
      <li>Easy to send directly to my daughter&#x27;s home so it would be there when I visited.</li>
      <li>Fast ship!</li>
      <li>This one is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Seems pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>Through nobody&#x27;s fault but my own I find that this will not work in my bathtub as the legs are much too wide.  </li>
      <li>The width barely fits in my shower, but it does fit and I plan to keep it around after my pregnancy for any day I just want to sit under the shower.</li>
      <li>Easy to disassemble and store for my next visit.</li>
      <li>For me I measured and it was slightly to large</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s almost too large, but that&#x27;s my fault.  </li>
      <li>I have a large shower and can move the bench in any position I want.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve had it for several months and it has held up well and been a HUGE relief for me to get off my feet and relax in the shower.</li>
      <li>VERY WELL.</li>
      <li>This has been very helpful.</li>
      <li>the tubes are rusted and there is a washer inside the rubber foot that is very corroded.</li>
      <li>Felt very stable and stayed in place.</li>
      <li>The washer needs to be stainless steel or another none corrosive metal.</li>
      <li>Item was delivered very timely and as advertised ...</li>
      <li>I did not measure from the bottom of the tub which is much narrower.  </li>
      <li>hand grips are very helpful and can still slide off</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and the hight can be adjusted.</li>
      <li>Really help me in shower alot</li>
      <li>Very adjustable.  </li>
      <li>As others have said measure correctly so you know the seat will fit as it is pretty wide.</li>
      <li>They will probably ask me to send it back and the shipping cost would be better spent on a new one.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tight fit in the tub</li>
      <li>With so many choices to pick from, it was hard to decide which bench to get.  </li>
      <li>Completely met my expectations.</li>
      <li>but I simply put it the other way to fit it.</li>
      <li>The seat is ok, hence the 4 star rating, it was a little rough for me</li>
      <li>Also small enough to fit in a stand-up shower.</li>
      <li>Just a little bit tight for my bath/shower area - but it does fit!</li>
      <li>So I am now going to order the other similar product that is more narrow and smaller overall and hope it will work for me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for my elderly mother. Assembly was super easy and quick, as well as the height adjustment. It is lightweight and easy to move, but sturdy. She is satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> BENCH WORKED OUT VERY WELL. I WAS ABLE TO ADJUST IT TO THE RIGHT HEIGHT.</li>
    <li> Perfect height for a 6&#x27;3 guy. Also small enough to fit in a stand-up shower.</li>
    <li> good height adjustment, good stability, easy to clean.  Lets me keep one leg(cast) out of the tub.</li>
    <li> A very nice sturdy lightweight bench at a great price. Easy to adjust the height. I bought it for my wifes knee surgery but it will be a keeper after she heals.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it&#x27;s been great. It holds either of us solidly (both 250 lbs +), doesn&#x27;t slip and fits nicely in our tub (granted, we have a roman bath-style tub). SUPER easy to put together and I can see how it would travel easily as well.</li>
    <li> The bench itself was everything I expected but when it was received the packaging was damaged and the side of the bench was broken.  The break in the bench would hold water if used. I had to use duct tape to cover the hole to keep water out of the bench and to prevent the bench from cutting my leg. Other than the damaged packaging which damaged the stool, it worked well.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my measurements were off...so it&#x27;s almost too large, but that&#x27;s my fault.  Otherwise it&#x27;s sturdy, stable and lightweight.  It&#x27;s a larger piece than I imagined - though I&#x27;m stuck with a stall shower.  Make sure your measurements are correct!</li>
    <li> Weight limit says 320lbs. I am 270lbs. I bought this before getting ankle surgery so I can shower afterwards for the next 3 weeks. It lasted through 4 showers before the legs gave out and started bending. Each shower was about 10 minutes long. I made sure to be very easy with it. I want my money back for false advertising or giving me a crappy one. I just ordered a 500lb heavy duty one and had to pay almost $11 extra to have it send over night so I can hopefully get it before my doctors appointment on Friday.</li>
    <li> This arrived very quickly. Had trouble figuring out how to get the caps on the legs. It was a bit of a struggle since there were no directions but its sturdy. I weigh over 260 and it held me just fine. It does what its suppose to do and I like that its adjustable!</li>
    <li> Completely met my expectations. Just a little bit tight for my bath/shower area - but it does fit!</li>
    <li> I could not use or rate the item because it arrived with only 3 legs instead of 4!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift. I have had it now for about six months.  It works well for me in my situation. There is a flaw in this product that no one else has mentioned, so I may have a lemon on my hands. My shower has white tile and under the feet of this chair are rust spots. Upon further inspection and removing the rubber feet the tubes are rusted and there is a washer inside the rubber foot that is very corroded. It is impossible to clean. The washer needs to be stainless steel or another none corrosive metal. I do not believe it is either one. I did not receive paperwork in the box because it was a gift. I will research if there is a warranty. They will probably ask me to send it back and the shipping cost would be better spent on a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately i can not use this product . I will have to buy another brand.  Maybe one made in the USA !</li>
    <li> Item was delivered very timely and as advertised ... I will ship them again! Thx.</li>
    <li> This has been very helpful. I have back problems and can&#x27;t stand very long. Got tired of taking baths and now I can shower again! It&#x27;s very sturdy and the hight can be adjusted. It&#x27;s a tight fit in the tub so if you are going to get one you should measure across the bottom of the tub to make sure it will fit.</li>
    <li> This product is defective and dangerous.  The legs would not lock in properly.  It nearly caused a serious fall in the shower.  I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did arrive on time, so the seller did their job.  The manufacturer is at fault.</li>
    <li> Easy to send directly to my daughter&#x27;s home so it would be there when I visited. Light - easy for me to lift into and out of tub/shower. Only took moments for her to put together. Easy to disassemble and store for my next visit. Sturdy - felt safe. I put a hand towel on the seat, otherwise I stick and couldn&#x27;t turn easily.</li>
    <li> When I opened it up, there were only 3 legs.</li>
    <li> This stool worked well while I recovered from foot surgery.  I used it for about 4 weeks without any problems.  The last day the legs bent when I shifted my weight and it was unusable after that.  It worked well as a short term solution.  I would not use it long term or for someone who is physically unstable.</li>
    <li> Really help me in shower alot</li>
    <li> My health required me to get a shower bench and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> excellent value and works well in a small shower unit</li>
    <li> I needed this to use when I had foot surgery. I just needed it to rest my leg and it worked perfect. Felt very stable and stayed in place. As others have said measure correctly so you know the seat will fit as it is pretty wide. For me I measured and it was slightly to large but I simply put it the other way to fit it. The seat is ok, hence the 4 star rating, it was a little rough for me and I mostly just rested my leg on it.</li>
    <li> Great price! Fast ship! The fact that all 4 legs were independently adjustable was great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how it is for a shower chair. I but it for a adjustable foot stool for under my table. For that, with a pillow it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> hand grips are very helpful and can still slide off</li>
    <li> After a month and a half of use the legs are  now wobbly. My mother almost fell when she tried to sit down on it. I am now trying to get manufacturer contact information to see if they will replace the item.</li>
    <li> I picked this up to have in my bathtub during my pregnancy to have something I can sit on and shave my legs. We&#x27;ve had it for several months and it has held up well and been a HUGE relief for me to get off my feet and relax in the shower. The width barely fits in my shower, but it does fit and I plan to keep it around after my pregnancy for any day I just want to sit under the shower. It doesn&#x27;t fold up, so storage can be tricky, I just keep it in the tub.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for. My husband had a fractured neck and 2 fractures of his spine when he was hit by a tractor on his moped.  He couldn&#x27;t stand for very long so this seat worked great for the shower. It is also nice that the legs are adjustable.</li>
    <li> With so many choices to pick from, it was hard to decide which bench to get.  This one is exactly what I wanted.  After breaking my foot and having surgery, I cannot put any weight on it for 4 weeks.  This bench works great so I can get a good shower without trying to balance on one leg and risk falling.  I have a large shower and can move the bench in any position I want.  It is sturdy, comfortable, and very reasonably priced.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is so light weight but sturdy. Great addition into my bathroom. Now I enjoy taking a bath knowing that I&#x27;ll be able to sit. Great product.</li>
    <li> Was sent back. It didn&#x27;t fit my tub.</li>
    <li> Right size for sitting &amp; right size to fit the shower. Seems pretty sturdy. Easy to assemble. Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Seemed to be the best of all that I looked at here.  Very adjustable.  Goes together initially with a little force to get things aligned, but perfect after assembly.  Solid, good grips on the bottom of the legs, stable and comfortable.</li>
    <li> My dad has alzheimers and an aide comes and helps with his bath.  I found several bath benches, $45.00 and up. Found this one and thought I&#x27;d try it, it&#x27;s been great. Was delivered a day ahead of time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our shower when our built-in bench fell apart.  It was the perfect size and easy to move about in the shower but suction feet keep in place.  It can also be moved to the tub if needed.</li>
    <li> I was just what I needed. Fits the shower great. So now I&#x27;m safe and happy. The price was good too.</li>
    <li> Pefect for support in the shower. Legs adjust easily.</li>
    <li> It is providing me with the added safety I need while dealing with my broken shoulder.</li>
    <li> Through nobody&#x27;s fault but my own I find that this will not work in my bathtub as the legs are much too wide.  I did not measure from the bottom of the tub which is much narrower.  Also keep in mind that that the further the legs are extended the wider it gets as the legs are not perpendicular to the floor as the picture looks like they are. The smallest is 17 3/4\\&quot; so I guess the 18.5\\&quot; width they show is with a middle leg length as it was even larger with the legs fully extended.  Other the being too big it does seem to be sturdy and well made and easy to assemble.  It is also light weight.  So I am now going to order the other similar product that is more narrow and smaller overall and hope it will work for me.  I would have given it 4 stars if they had given better measurements.</li>
    <li> Light weight shower chair</li>
