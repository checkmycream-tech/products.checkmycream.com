### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very very happy with that cream, no fragrance and no tears.</li>
      <li>Replenishes wonderful.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Very good eye cream.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>During the time that it was available to purchase through Macy&#x27;s or The Cosmetics Company store, it was perfect!</li>
      <li>the thinking being that if what I&#x27;m buying at CVS costs $30 for 2.5 oz, the 0.5 oz Clinique would have to be amazing for the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I honestly see no change.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best eye cream I have ever tried, and I have tried many!  </li>
      <li>I love Clinique Anti-gravity eye lift.  </li>
      <li>This product was just okay.  </li>
      <li>I will surely order this product again</li>
      <li>, after 3 months, am not so sure on long-term wrinkle reduction under eyes.</li>
      <li>continued use makes it even better.</li>
      <li>and I love it,</li>
      <li>the program works is you purchase a minimum Clinique purchase of $25 or more</li>
      <li>and you receive a lovely bonus kit.  </li>
      <li>Used for years - nothing better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In October, during their latest promotion, I bought some foundation and received the bonus kit.  </li>
      <li>They should have made sure they had plenty of help there.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gotta say good things about an IMMEDIATELY noticeable positive change though.  :)</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping to see better results on the fine lines around my eyes than I was seeing with the drug store brands I was using...</li>
      <li>Over a year ago, a friend of mine told me about the Clinique free with purchase program they do throughout the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>How refreshing to find a skin product that really WORKS!  </li>
      <li>and I want to spend money when a product is worth it.</li>
      <li>I love the cream, but this was obviously old.</li>
      <li>and L&#x27;Oreal make the same type product with better results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>He noticed a positive effect immediately.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe it really did any lifting of the skin around my eyes.</li>
      <li>This is by far hands down my favorite eye cream ever.</li>
      <li>Something our Clinique counter offered was for you to come back the first week of November</li>
      <li>It completely smooths out the lines under my eyes, and everything looks firm and smooth.  </li>
      <li>This IS a good, albeit Quite Expensive potion for under-eye moisture.</li>
      <li>Less dry/crepe effect right</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old and have wrinkles, sagging skin under my eyes and recently, my upper eyelid started to sag also.</li>
      <li>but I usually buy it fresh from the stores.</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate and spend a lot of time outside - lots of sunshins.  </li>

    <li> This product was just okay.  I don&#x27;t believe it really did any lifting of the skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Used for years - nothing better.  I live in a dry climate and spend a lot of time outside - lots of sunshins.  Replenishes wonderful.</li>
    <li> How refreshing to find a skin product that really WORKS!  I&#x27;m telling all my sisters and other friends about it!</li>
    <li> Very good eye cream.  It really works.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this because he has incredibly dry skin. During the time that it was available to purchase through Macy&#x27;s or The Cosmetics Company store, it was perfect! He never had any trouble with his dry flaky skin. In addition to that, the fines lines and wrinkles disappeared too. Sadly, it&#x27;s getting increasingly difficult to find anymore.</li>
    <li> Takes 10 years off of your eyes. continued use makes it even better.</li>
    <li> Over a year ago, a friend of mine told me about the Clinique free with purchase program they do throughout the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the program works is you purchase a minimum Clinique purchase of $25 or more and you receive a lovely bonus kit.  Usually the kits have a new makeup bag, samples of mascara, lipstick, facial cream, sunscreen, or foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October, during their latest promotion, I bought some foundation and received the bonus kit.  Something our Clinique counter offered was for you to come back the first week of November and you could get an extra bonus.  You could have a mini makeover or facial.  I elected to do the &amp;#34;dramatic eye makeover&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about the experience was that when we got there, there was only one Clinique beauty specialist there and there were women waiting to pay for their purchases plus another lady waiting to have her makeover done.  I was not very happy.  I had even signed up for an appointment and they .  were short handed.  They should have made sure they had plenty of help there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty consultant told me that I had sagging eyelids (yes unfortunately I noticed that some time ago).  She suggested I try Clinique&#x27;s Anti-Gravity Firming Eye Lift Cream.  She told me she used it herself and that to try it for two weeks and I would notice a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s been two weeks and I just used the last of the sample.  I honestly see no change.  My eye lids still sag.  I was really disappointed as I hoped this cream would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what Clinique says their cream will do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Densely hydrating cream lifts, firms around the eyes. Helps erase the look of lines. Builds cushion into time-thinned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work for some women, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eye cream I have ever tried, and I have tried many!  It completely smooths out the lines under my eyes, and everything looks firm and smooth.  It also makes my eyeliner go on smoother!  I never thought I wouild actually find a product that would do what they all say they will do, this works!!!</li>
    <li> It was smaller size than expected and different type of cream than I expected.</li>
    <li> I love Clinique Anti-gravity eye lift.  I actually see a difference after applying it.  I have tried other more expensive products but this is the one that works for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day for about 3 months now, purchased at about 50% savings than this price at an international (Mexico) duty-free shop. What spurred the purchase was both needing to use up pesos + my husband&#x27;s noting he needs to switch to cosmetics&#x27; chemical engineering (v research on other matters) due to the name alone on this one!  He noticed a positive effect immediately. Less dry/crepe effect right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, after 3 months, am not so sure on long-term wrinkle reduction under eyes. Now, this IS very moisturizing, and when I use this IN COMBINATION with the Facercize under-eye exercises, I DO see a positive effect lessening those darned otherwise impossible under-eye guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me and exercises though... seem an oil+water combination. This IS a good, albeit Quite Expensive potion for under-eye moisture. So... I&#x27;m not sure if this is a hearty thumbs-up or thumbs sideways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say good things about an IMMEDIATELY noticeable positive change though.  :)</li>
    <li> product feels like silk when applying and a difference in noticed in just a few days. I will surely order this product again</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to see better results on the fine lines around my eyes than I was seeing with the drug store brands I was using... the thinking being that if what I&#x27;m buying at CVS costs $30 for 2.5 oz, the 0.5 oz Clinique would have to be amazing for the price.&lt;br /&gt;That was wishful thinking.&lt;br /&gt;ROC and L&#x27;Oreal make the same type product with better results.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product, and I&#x27;ll never buy it again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews. I use this cream all the time and I love it, but I usually buy it fresh from the stores. I ordered this last month, I just opened the box today and the cream was dry like wax, it is suppose to be loose like pudding. It ended up pulling the delicate eye tissue. I love the cream, but this was obviously old.</li>
    <li> I like this .I think it helps firm the eye lids will update my review in three months .</li>
    <li> This is by far hands down my favorite eye cream ever.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Well I thought I&#x27;ve tried them all, but obviously I missed Clinique. This product is amazing! I&#x27;m 50 years old and have wrinkles, sagging skin under my eyes and recently, my upper eyelid started to sag also. It gave me an asian look, which was cute but difficult to wear mascara and eyeliner. I saw the results after the 2nd morning and still, it&#x27;s improving. I&#x27;m very very happy with that cream, no fragrance and no tears. To pay $23 for a cream that only tighten the skin around my eyes (Olay ProX) or to pay $37 for a cream that takes care of wrinkles, firmness and lift litterally my look? To me,  my eyes and my teeth are what people see and I want to spend money when a product is worth it. I recommend this product for all women 45+.</li>
