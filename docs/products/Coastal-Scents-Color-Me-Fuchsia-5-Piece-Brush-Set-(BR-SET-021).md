    <li> Brushes are stinky , they have another set of travel brushes that I bough ( it is in a fold out case) same price, much better quality...</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes. Soft and hairs do NOT fall out like others that I&#x27;ve paid more for. Will purchase Coastal Scents in the future. This set will make for a nice gift! Perfect travel size.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend, and am happy to report that she is enjoying and getting good use out of it. The bristles are nice and soft and blend color into the skin very nicely. I may have to purchase one of these for myself to throw in my purse :-)</li>

    <li> Great set! Clean up easily, hold their shape and don&#x27;t shed. The pouch is great for you purse. I use it to store my makeup essentials so they don&#x27;t get lost in my purse or makeup bag. Planning on buying a few to give as gifts for my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the road a lot and this works perfectly for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if I damage or lose it, I&#x27;m out a lot of money.</li>
    <li> beautiful brushes. soft and non shedding!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are synthetic and super soft. For the price they are a great deal for low-med end brushes.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and switching my makeup brushes back and forth was just a pain.  This solved all those problems.  You have all the basic brushes you need to get the job done and the brushes are of high quality for the price.  They are a bit smaller than a full size brush but the case is very compact because of it.  I would recommend this to anyone on the go!</li>
    <li> It is a good set to have at work if you need to refresh your makeup. I would not use it for a new makeup application. I added a couple of brushes to it for the eyes. There was room in the pouch. It keeps the brushes protected no matter where you keep them.</li>
    <li> Very soft and beautiful brushes. use them for my travel makeup kit</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I have the big set and I got these for my niece who is starting out in make up. They are very good quality and super cute.</li>
    <li> Softest brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Wonderful for blending. The other brushes were a bit smaller than I assumed they&#x27;d be but they&#x27;re good for other, smaller areas that need attention. Would for sure recommend Coastal Scents brushes, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! Very firm and not flimsy at all. The case is the perfect size for carrying daily in my purse.</li>
