<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was disappointed to discover that the cream form of Tussy deodorant was removed from  our area pharmacies.  And so thrilled to find the product that I have used for over 50 years on amazon.  Needless to say, I am thrilled with my discovery and the product.  This product is mild, yet effective for me. Thank you amazon for providing products that stores discontinue because of limited sales, yet that which a  number of shoppers prefer.</li>
    <li> I have used Tussy for 40-50 years...can&#x27;t remember. However it has been the best deodorant I have ever used.  I have tried many other brands along my journey of playing sports and excessive perspiration.  No other product works for me and those around me like ol&#x27; fashioned Tussy.</li>
    <li> My job required me to be in a Texas outdoor working enviornment most of my adult life doing maintenance on various types of aircraft. Some days the temperature became very hot causing me to perspire very heavily. WOW did it get hot and did I perspire. Then one day while shoping at a drug store I noticed the Tussy Cream Deodorant on the shelf. I bought some and started using it. It did a SUPER job of controling my perspiration even on the hottest days. I am 83 years old and retired and now buy my Tussy at Amazon.com and still rely on Tussy to keep my under arms dry and odor free.  Ken B</li>
    <li> Since Tussy is difficult to find, it was terrific to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was suprised to have received my item earlier then expected and the price was to good to be true.</li>
    <li> I have used Tussy deodorant for over 30 years and what I purchased from Amazon.com in October 2010 was bad.  It was hard, not creamy and I could not use it.  There was a sticker on each jar and under this sticker it said $1.00.  I paid much more.    It will be a very long time before I purchase anything from Amazon.com again.</li>
    <li> This is the same product I used for decades.  It never irritated and worked as well as any other.  Since it gradually disappeared from store shelves (sorry I did not stock up), I have been forced to try other brands.  This is the best, and I am happy to have it again.  The stock is fresh, not stale.  And the spicy fragrance is the same, smells natural and not artificial like all the others.  I cannot understand why this was discontinued.  Expensive now, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed!  The jars were not full, as if someone else had used them.  However, it was not worth paying to return them.    When I e-mailed the sellers, they would not send others or offer to pay for returning them.  I will never purchase anything from them again.</li>
    <li> I cannot find a good deodorant in stores anymore.  Plain deodorant does not irritate me.  This cream does not stain and has a light fragrance and I can use it every day.  Thanks for having it.</li>
    <li> i have used this product since the 1950&#x27;s/  Was very disappointed when I could no longer buy it in the stores and have recently received my latest order of several jars from Amazon.  Still good as ever, however, I recently opened a jar that was hard, dry, and shrunken.  I have not tried to use it. I have not checked the others, but one is not worth returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope that i will continue to be able to purchase Tussy.  I have found no other deodorant as good for me.</li>
    <li> The Tussy Deordorant was somewhat dry; however we are using it.  I understand it is probably old as the manufacturer is no longer in business.  I will probably consider ordering from this source again. How I miss the original version of this extremely effective product.</li>
    <li> I like Tussy, but was disappointed upon receipt of the product, it was watery, not as creamy as I am use to.  I am not sure the company checked the product before mailing.</li>
    <li> We have used this producr for years. I once could buy itin the grocery store, butit has become very hard to find.  This is the only deoderant my husband can use, I am so glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> In recent months I have discovered that I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirant. I itch terribly from a rash that develops almost immediately after I apply the product to my skin.  I remembered when I was younger using Tussy and it was very mild.  Same applies now, it&#x27;s very mild and I have no itching or irritation.  The product did seem a slight bit hard in the container but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t work around using the warmth of my fingertips.</li>
    <li> For many years I used Tussy Deodorant Cream.  However, Walgreen&#x27;s discontinued it. I tried two other brands which were not effective.  I am very happy that Amazon carries this excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I can use. I was surprised but very pleased to find it online.</li>
    <li> tHIS IS NOT LIKE THE ORIGINAL. HIGHLY FRAGRANCED AND VERY WATERY.</li>
    <li> My Mother is 90 years old. As far back as I can remember she has used no other deodorant except Tussy cream deodorant. She is allergic to so many things. She has never had any problem with this cream deodorant. She is upset now that we cannot buy it in a store. The only two places in our small town that did sell it cannot get it anymore. I have been told that when it was available the store would sell out in hours. Could someone please tell me why it is no longer available?      Thank you,    Sad Mother&#x27;s Daughter</li>
    <li> A elderly home health client got me started using this. She always smelled so good when I visited her and I finally asked what she had on. Now I get the same comments - I don&#x27;t use perfume anymore. This makes me smell so clean.</li>
    <li> My wife has tried a number of deodorants over the years, and still prefers Tussy Deodorant Cream.  She has been unable to find it on local retail shelves.  The 3 pack arrived promptly in good order.</li>
    <li> The jars arrived secured in plastic wrap.  This was chief concern after having arrived loose in an envelope, leaking.  The merchant had sent me a replacement with the jars taped.  Very nice.  This year, the packaging was professionally wrapped.  Very good!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this deodorant for 40 years. Hard to find in any store now. Thanks.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it on your site.</li>
    <li> What can I say? The product was as I remembered it over 40 years ago. Thankfully, Amazon has this hard to find product which works wonderfully. It came on time and it works. Tussy is one of those products that has stood the test of time and the only deodorant I can put on every other day rather than everyday. If I forget a day, no worries. Love it. And it was priced right.</li>
    <li> I have used Tussy Deodorant since I was a teenager and I am now in my 60&#x27;s!!! I have tried other deodorants and have never been satisfied with them. I like the cream and the smell of it. However, the consistency of the cream has changed. It is not as creamy as it used to be. I have to order it through Amazon now as I can&#x27;t find any store in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area that carries it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this opportunity.</li>
    <li> Due to allergies, I have trouble with strong smelling deodorants.  This one is mild and effective.</li>
    <li> It is the only product I can use because I am allergic to every other deodorant. This product has been discontinued, so this where I have buy it now, not available in stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product,been using it since 1966.It is the only product that works for me.I am so glad I found again.</li>
    <li> Nice spicy smell, long lasting, not messy, does the job.  Smoothes on easily.  We have used Tussy Cream for over 40 years and still find it the best.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have been using it for at least 40 years.  Not only is it economical , but works better than any deodorant I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, not all the poisonous additives in it.  Been using it for many years.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed tussy for years I have sensitive skin and can hardly use anything else I made a big mistake and did not change my address and  never received my package I inquired about it and iam in hopes one day I will get it I donot know if it was returned or not the people that sent it is trying to find out what happen now eddietootoojr</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, just as I remember</li>
    <li> What I received was in a Tussy container, but it didn&#x27;t resemble the product I know as Tussy.  In color, consistency, and scent, it seemed exactly like Arrid Extra Dry.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. She&#x27;s used it for years and swears by it. Not my cup of tea, but I happy I can still get it for her!!</li>
    <li> I have used Tussy Deoderant for over 45 years and it is the only one I can count on not to break out my underarms.  I find it also very effective as a deoderant.</li>
    <li> Tussy is the best deodorant on the market, they need to put it back in the stores.I would continue to buy Tussy as long as it&#x27;s being made!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The 3 pack arrived quickly and it is just what my mother wanted.  She can no longer find this deodorant in any stores.</li>
    <li> Once I bought my wolf shirt, i was quite the man about town....but since discovering Tussy, I immediately transformed into a ladykiller!!!!!  Thanks Tussy!</li>
    <li> I ordered three.  Two were hard.  I spoke with the company and they told me that if I retured them, they would send a replacement.  I returned but have not received the replacement.</li>
    <li> What can I say about Tussy.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 50 years.  It&#x27;s part of my life.</li>
    <li> I really love the Tussy Deodorant for my husband. He has used this deodorant for over 28 years.  I recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is great, I got it for my husband to be, and he loves it, and best of all, it smells great on him, making him even more sexy to me!!</li>
    <li> This Is a product that I use regularly and have been using for a lot of years and it has yet to fail me.</li>
    <li> purchased this for my elderly aunt.  It is what she has used all her life and was not available in stores here.&lt;br /&gt;she  was very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is terrific.  I do not like anything with a strong smell and this deodorant has just a hint of smell so it is non-offensive.  (My grandmother used this product and) I have used it for years.  I just cannot find it locally anymore.  I was very happy to find it online.</li>
    <li> I really like this , been using it since late 501s .very low fragrance and it WORKS very well</li>
    <li> Love and have always loved this product!</li>
    <li> have been using it for years sorry to see it out of stores . price was 1.88 in stores now 13.00 for three</li>
    <li> all three jars were dry</li>
    <li> I bought this upon the insistance of gal-friend.    She says its the ONLY one that is any good.  And her mom said so too.  And so did her mom&#x27;s mom.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this deodorant....the only place I can find it any more is on line. This time it was even BETTER, it wasn&#x27;t old, it was fresh and creamy like I remember.</li>
    <li> like this product chose it because i use it  yes i will recommend this product to anyone that ask about it</li>
    <li> Tussy is like the best thing.  This is a old school Deodorant and very hard to find nowadays.  I like to switch up Deodorants every so often.</li>
    <li> My older mother after breast surgery couldn&#x27;t use OTC deodorant applications.  This hand applied deodorant was her god send with having no &amp;#34;armpit&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for thirty years. It meets my needs and expectations.</li>
    <li> love it  i  really  works and  it  keeps  you  fresh  and  smells  good  and  you  will  love it  try it</li>
    <li> I have been looking for my old standby for  long time. Am happy to find it again.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted.  My Mom used it and really liked it.  It is hard to find just deodorant any more.  everything is anti-pirsperant.</li>
    <li> I used this since 1972, my mom, gramma used this brand too.  It was removed from the stores in las cruces about two years ago....NOTHING COMPARES to this. No chemical smell, no white marks, doesn&#x27;t conflict with my perfume....</li>
    <li> GREAT - GRANDMOTHER&#x27;S FAVORITE AND SHE WAS A VERY WISE LOVING LADY. I STRAYED AWAY BUT HAD TO RETURN AND FOLLOW IN GRANDMOM&#x27;S FOOTSTEPS.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Light pleasant scent. Family members have been using for years. Glad to find here as cannot find in stores any more!</li>
    <li> Thanks for having it available.  No longer available in my area and I used it for years.  Nevers fails.  Always works.&lt;br /&gt;The Best.</li>
    <li> I am 75 years old and have used this since my teens  This was the deodorant my mother always used.&lt;br /&gt;she bought it at Shillitos (a quality department store which is now Macys) in downtown Cincinnati Ohio, over the years  I have had to seach for this at various discount stores and now your website is the only place I can find the original spice scent.  My 55 year old daughter will only use this.  Please continue to carry this product.</li>
    <li> I was not able to use the entire jar as it was very dried and crusty on the top. Too expensive to only get half the jar.</li>
    <li> This product is the best and has been for the 60 years I have used it. I was delighted to find it available on line since no stores carry it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants a deodorant that works every time all the time...the spicy scent is especially nice.</li>
    <li> I used this deodorant 40 plus years ago, then went to all sorts of other choices over the years &amp; had issues.  Finally gave up aluminum deoderants almost a year ago.  THAT DID NOT WORK.  Could not find one that would last 10 hours let alone all day even when it got cooler.  And I smelled.  Went back to this basic &amp; have been happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my aunt. She has a very difficult time finding Tussy. This is the ONLY brand she will use. This product showed up faster than we expected and in tact.</li>
    <li> Excellent deodorant from the 1950&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Tussy is an older brand but exactly what I need.  I&#x27;ve tried organic/natural deodorants without much success.  However, this older brand is working just great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for sensitive skin. It does its job great with no irritation that some other deodorants and anti-perspirants can cause. Received my order fast and in great shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tussey since i948 and it works very well. Any other deorants cause a rash. Its no longer sold at the local c.v.s. pharmacy</li>
    <li> I have used Tussy Cream for over 45 years.  The quality is still great.  Sorry to hear cream will no longer be made.</li>
    <li> When I was in my teens going through puberty I had tried different deoderants and none worked very well .I discovered Tussy through a relative and was hooked lol. It lasted all day ,kept me dry and I loved the gentle spice scent.I can&#x27;t remember the reason I stopped using it I guess the need was not so important since there were other brands.As I grew into adult hood I have had a stronger under arm odor smell.I changed my diet and eating habits and still nothing helped .I just recently remembered Tussy and thank goodness Amazon has it .Without fail I went a whole day smelling good and feeling dry .I kept smelling under my arms every few hours lol and even the next day before I showered ,I was still smelling fresh .I believe there is a reason the stores are getting rid of Tussy because it works very well and there is competition .Tussy has had a great reputation for years and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t solid like it was supposed to be and crumbles every time I put it on.  I don&#x27;t know if it has been on the shelf too long or just old.</li>
    <li> Had to buy a case of this because I believe they are discontinuing it.  This is the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash all the way down my sides to my waist.</li>
    <li> This product is the only deodorant that I can find that does not break out my underarms. I have been using for at least 15 years&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame it can&#x27;t be bought over the counter any more.</li>
    <li> I love Tussy deodorant. I am so pleased with this product I have used it for over 40 years. So happy it is still available. Thank you. Frances F. Sykes</li>
    <li> i always use it for ever i love it and never smell bad  i got this since i was 1 been 46 years</li>
    <li> Given as a gift to someone who was looking for the Tussy deodorant but was unable to locate it.  He was and is very pleased.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no irritation, and controls man-stink perfectly.  Even no irritation on the naughty bits...  :)</li>
    <li> love this product have been using since I was 10. long ago in the 50&#x27;s. super clean fresh smell, and does not harm you with aluminum like those antipersperants.</li>
    <li> The product is the same as it was years ago. I bought it for grandma and she loves it. Buy it if you like cream deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used tussy and I know it sounds funny but, my mother and I hearts broke when hey pulled it from all store shelves. We&#x27;ve struggled trying new types of brands out but, none could hold use all day. My mom was literally using two different types at once more than twice a day. I would have to apply more than needed about three times a day. Once we found it online for the best price we couldn&#x27;t wait and had to order. Now we are back to only applying tussy once a day in the morning and smelling the freshness all day. The customer service and speed of delivery was amazing. Once again thank you and I am planning on ordering more within the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a longtime, but in recent years it is not found in big box drug stores. It works well for my sensitive under arms and Amazon is the only site I have been able to find the product. It has always arrived fresh and creamy. I just wish it could be applied in a less messy fashion.</li>
    <li> The problem was that stores stopped stocking the item.  Few people I guess know how good it is.  Go figure.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with the product.  I have been using it for years.  The package was well wrapped and it was deliverred as stated in the e-mail.</li>
    <li> Always smells great, always get complements for smelling good. Seems a bit dry compared to what I used before. Not as easy to spread on. Added a couple of drops of water.</li>
    <li> less chemicals and odorless but long lasting protection.  Would stain clothes if not rubbed in or wear an undershirt.  Would highly recommend for kids, especially athletes</li>
    <li> Great will order it again</li>
    <li> This is the hardest deodorant to find! It has been my favorite for years, but have not seen it in any store shelves for some time now. I&#x27;m so glad to have seen this on the web! I love being able to apply it as a cream, and the subtle spicy scent does not make me smell like I&#x27;m wearing deodorant when the heat is on. It&#x27;s a perfect match for me : )</li>
    <li> Used it for decadeds!</li>
    <li> Have used this daily since 1950. Am nearly ready to order again. Any time when I tried other ones were not as good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tussy deodorant for many years, then is seemed to disappear from the stores.  Glad to have found it again online.  its a really good product.</li>
    <li> My favorite an hard to find anywhere else....</li>
    <li> The texture was not like the first time I ordered from here, It was almost creamy if that makes sense</li>
    <li> Having allergic reactions to deodorants is no fun.  Finding one of the few I can use comfortably has not been easy.  So glad it is here!</li>
    <li> I remember using this as a very young girl (about age 12 or so).  When I found out they still make it I was so happy.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for many, many years.  Didn&#x27;t even know it was still made.  .  Friend suggested I use Amazon.  Wow!  I was able to purchase it and it is the only deodorant I will ever use from now on.  It is so pure and mild for young folks and even though I am well beyond young it is and always will be the only one I use.  No propellants, chemicals, etc found in spray deodorants.  it is the most effective deodorant I have ever used and if and  when I am in a position where I cannot shower for a day or two, no problem.  I think the longest I have gone was 4-5 days (camping trip) and it was still effective.  BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.  Cannot understand why it is not advertised more often.  As long as it is still manufactured I am a customer for life!  Everyone (especially young girls and all women) should try it,  They will not be disappointed.  I am in 7th Heaven since finding out I could purchase it through Amazon.  Keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn F.</li>
    <li> This product has been around for years and it still gets the job done. It is easy to apply and last all day long.</li>
    <li> Wife has been using for years.  Could not find in any stores.  Very reasonable price.  Wife stated &amp;#34;it is the best deodorant, I love it&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Simple purchase and delivery, everything went as expected and advertised.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy this much cheaper so I dropped it one star for that.  I still like the product</li>
    <li> Tussy is a great product that I have grown up with! And I am extremely hype over finding it on Amazon...&amp; also the saler not only was great to buy from their Customer Service was 5star at all times... Great job Guys...Thank You</li>
    <li> I have a great-grandson, age 12, has been complaining to his mother, my granddaughter, that he was always musty.  So the three pack was for him,  He has been very happy. Because he is challenged, my next purchase will be the roll-on.  I hope it is just as effective.</li>
