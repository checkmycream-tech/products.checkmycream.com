      <li>and i&#x27;m so happy my hair didn&#x27;t fall out because i would have been devastated with this out come.</li>
      <li>So, I went and bought Purple Plum because I&#x27;ve read great reviews on N Rage products, plus it&#x27;s Not semi-permanent.</li>
      <li>This dye is AMAZING in my hair!</li>
      <li>And it smells good also.</li>
      <li>Since there is still a good amount in the bottle I will try again, maybe bleaching the hair or mixing with peroxide.</li>
      <li>It sticks good but should not be labled purple plum</li>
      <li>I have used N&#x27;rage dye before and loved it.</li>
      <li>I love this color!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>my first experience with this brand is very good!</li>
      <li>when I use this dye, I can go 2 months before I need to redo my hair (with roots and evening out the color) which is amazing , compared to ion brilliance where you need to do it almost twice a month.</li>
      <li>It kind of has a geode effect on my hair because it wasn&#x27;t evenly bleached to one set color before using this dye.  </li>
      <li>and i loved that as time went on and the color faded it turned into a nice light purple.</li>
      <li>One of the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>So far, none has rubbed off on any clothes or pillows, the color isn&#x27;t washing out or fading, and shines very brilliantly in the sunlight.</li>
      <li>By far the best dye ive used</li>
      <li>even in bright light.</li>
      <li>In the beginning, I was quite diligent with using color safe shampoo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been so in love with my hair color.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love N rage</li>
      <li>After comparing brands (more specifically, brands available at Sally&#x27;s), I came across N-Rage!</li>
      <li>my family would love to sniff the bottle of dye.</li>
      <li>not only does it work well, and lasts, it smells AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>The longer the shampoo sits on your hair, the more the dye will come out.</li>
      <li>I saw the swatch for this and fell so in love with it.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use a developer regardless of strength because you don&#x27;t want to damage your hair any more if you do have already bleached hair.</li>
      <li>I am in LOVE with the color!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>love love N&#x27;Rage &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>Lovely as it may have been...</li>
      <li>which worried me even more.</li>
      <li>Awesome color, don&#x27;t even need to bleach your hair if you don&#x27;t want to, and fades in SUCH a cool way.  </li>
      <li>Clean hair makes for better results.</li>
      <li>Now this sounds like a good thing, but I&#x27;ve heard that healthy hair will not take to colored dyes as easily because the pores are not open!</li>
      <li>(It was a light gray color at that point)</li>
      <li>To prolong the color in my hair I wash it with cool water and wash it quickly!</li>
      <li>I originally went to a salon and paid about 300 dollar to have my hair dyed purple....</li>
      <li>love this dye, so I&#x27;ll see if the turquoise will work for me ;)</li>
      <li>Of all hair dyes i&#x27;ve tried, this has by far been my favorite!</li>
      <li>I have tried the conditioner trick people recommend to make the consistency of the dye more manageable but the dye, while still pretty, is not as bold.</li>
      <li>This dye came out bright blue when she put it on her hair.</li>
      <li>I have to bleach my hair before, and let the dye set for the full time.</li>
      <li>but I LOVED how it looked and how I technically paid for one color and ended up getting four!</li>
      <li>It took beautifully over all that and also over my dark roots.</li>
      <li>there are good things about this dye but the one big fault is that it&#x27;s not purple until it starts to fade</li>
      <li>It starts off a dark royal purple and then gradually it fades to a beautiful plum then into a lavender over 2+ months.</li>
      <li>The dye quickly washed away and faded into a bright blue.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t care less because it was quite a beautiful color.</li>
      <li>I tried 3 different brands, with this one being BY FAR the most successful.  </li>
      <li>I prefer bold.</li>
      <li>As others have said, the swatch at the store was a lovely vibrant purple, with magenta</li>
      <li>After a couple of washes it turned regular purple and lasted many many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brand I originally was going to get didn&#x27;t look right on the swatch.</li>
      <li>It starts out very dark shimmery plum purple, and fades out over those weeks to a beautiful fuchsia color.</li>
      <li>It worked pretty well, although some areas are MUCH more vibrant than others.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply with a tinting brush, and it smells like bubble gum, which I know some have said they didn&#x27;t like, but I liked it FAR better than a couple of the other colors</li>
      <li>it is still bright and pink</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s important to point out that you really have to work the product into your hair.</li>
      <li>this is well worth the almost 15 dollars for a tube.</li>
      <li>Licensed cosmetologist, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>(We did laugh at the instructions to \\&quot;shake</li>
      <li>and you have a nice blonde toner.</li>
      <li>When it does fade, it is still so pretty, but I don&#x27;t think I noticed the fancy shampoo keeping it bold longer</li>
      <li>Special Effects (which is supposed to be one of the best brands~) which turned almost a dead-grass green color after only three washes...</li>
      <li>maybe it will come out right.</li>
      <li>the picture is what it looked like right after dying and drying.</li>
      <li>I even lifted my hair to a cool snowy white shade, so I would have expected it to dye beautifully,</li>
      <li>Even though it wasn&#x27;t true to color, this dye lasted long and had a lovely bubble gum scent.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t stained my shower but the first couple of washes, I use my kitchen sink because it is a smurf-death.</li>
      <li>Thankfully I had some pink manic panic laying around and was able to mix to achieve a true purple color.</li>
      <li>On top of this, the dye severely stained my skin and my entire bathroom.</li>
      <li>I used shampoo at first, but it didn&#x27;t get all of it out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be interested to hear if anyone else has encountered this phenomenon, or can explain it.</li>
      <li>My favorite blue or purple hair dye.</li>
      <li>Wear gloves when you wash the dye out the first two washes, in fact.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no mirror in the laundry room where we were dyeing, so I can&#x27;t say what it looked like, but she was pretty emphatic about it.</li>
      <li>so I began my search for a better brand for my hair, and especially one that I didn&#x27;t have to order online.</li>
      <li>Definitely a more blue purple</li>
      <li>I had a really pretty shade of lavender, that I got from Manic Panic Purple Haze.  </li>
      <li>thought this stuff worked a lot better than manic panic and it lasts a long time</li>
      <li>There is no color after the first wash, unless you leave it on without rinsing for like a whole day.</li>
      <li>Better but still washes out quite quickly - almost all color gone in 4 washes or less.</li>
      <li>The first two purple shades I tried left a pinkish and even almost orange tint to it in places that were&#x27;nt as light as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It does wash off skin easily though, so I don&#x27;t even have any giant complaints on that either.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to temporary colors that fade after a certain number of washes</li>
      <li>Overall super satisfied by the product and would definitely recommend this brand to anyone trying fashion colors on their hair.</li>
      <li>This came out straight up blue, which is fine if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
      <li>my stylist and I are responsible for not noticing sooner...</li>
      <li>After a minute she stopped and said, \\&quot;I can see it changing - it&#x27;s the heat that&#x27;s doing it.\\&quot; A very Dean Stockwell moment.</li>
      <li>I pre lighten/bleach as my hair is light brown/dark blonde - apply dye (use gloves!)</li>
      <li>This is the best \\&quot;crazy color\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Dyed beautifully but not sure how it is holding up as my daughter left to visit Grandma</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the actual dye, but strongly discourage purchase from an online seller after my experience.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love N rage color!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally very difficult, because it has a tendency to retain its&#x27; strength and health even after a lot of damage. Now this sounds like a good thing, but I&#x27;ve heard that healthy hair will not take to colored dyes as easily because the pores are not open! My hair is straight/wavy, medium thickness, and has been dyed 2 different colors and bleached 3 times. So now that you know my hair type, here&#x27;s the story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought and applied a full bottle of (Sonic Green) Special Effects (which is supposed to be one of the best brands~) which turned almost a dead-grass green color after only three washes... so I began my search for a better brand for my hair, and especially one that I didn&#x27;t have to order online. After comparing brands (more specifically, brands available at Sally&#x27;s), I came across N-Rage! And although they didn&#x27;t have the exact color I wanted, I decided that anything was better than faded green, and bought Twisted Teal ~&lt;br /&gt;and I am in LOVE with the color!&lt;br /&gt;It came out a nice medium ocean-like teal over my hair (bleached from very dark brown to almost dirty blonde) and STICKS! So far, none has rubbed off on any clothes or pillows, the color isn&#x27;t washing out or fading, and shines very brilliantly in the sunlight. The only thing is that it also sticks to skin, so you might have teal ears, neck, and hands for a day or two! It does wash off skin easily though, so I don&#x27;t even have any giant complaints on that either.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my first experience with this brand is very good! I will be purchasing it again in the future ~</li>
    <li> I originally went to a salon and paid about 300 dollar to have my hair dyed purple....it came out red....not an ugly red but definitely not the purple I wanted. Since my hair had already been bleached as the red washed out I did some research on the internet and decided to give nrage a try. It is very thick kind of like massaging a heavy conditioner into the hair. My hair is about halfway down my back so one bottle doesn&#x27;t fully color all of my hair but I&#x27;m okay with that because the random streaks of bleached hair gives my overall look some character. At first was this color is a super dark almost black purple that you don&#x27;t see to it&#x27;s full potential unless you&#x27;re in the son. Also your first few showers will look like Barney just died in the bath tub. After a few more washes it gets to be a much lighter purple and a few more washes after that it looks to be a periwinkle blue almost. Lasts me overall about 1.5 months. I wash my hair every 3rd day on this product. Overall super satisfied by the product and would definitely recommend this brand to anyone trying fashion colors on their hair.</li>
    <li> I love this color! It starts off a dark royal purple and then gradually it fades to a beautiful plum then into a lavender over 2+ months. Perfect for my pop up highlights! I cant find it being sold anywhere else anymore though so I bpught 2 in hopes it will last long enough!</li>
    <li> After reading a few other reviews, I went ahead and left my dye on for about 6 hours after bleaching it to almost-platinum and I am beyond impressed with the results. I&#x27;ve never had unnatural color last for more than a week until it starts to dull and fade, but its been almost 3 weeks and my hair is barely beginning to show signs of lightening. I used the Fuschia color- would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting an awesome crazy, long lasting color. I&#x27;ve also been using ion color-safe hair products, fyi.</li>
    <li> This dye made my hair blue, just wanted to say I was really hoping for a sweet plum purple and ended up with patriotic blue. I even lifted my hair to a cool snowy white shade, so I would have expected it to dye beautifully, anyway I am not very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> thought this stuff worked a lot better than manic panic and it lasts a long time sometimes seems like it lasts longer than colour wave that prelightens and colors in one step. im impressed with the quality and it smells like plums! i dyed chunky highlights in my hair one week after paying $172 at a salon for some chic to turn my hair purple which turned out all kinds of messed up and was pink not purple. then when i used the n&#x27;rage purple plum to tone down the pink its been like two months now and the purple i dyed it is still bright and pink has now pretty much faded to blonde. at first when you dye it it is very dark and only noticeable in sun or brightly lit areas. never again will i pay someone to dye my hair when she damaged it in the first place, dyed it the wrong color and cut it exactly how i told her not too. all in all spend $10-15 as oppose to $170 unless of course you are blonde already then maybe it will come out right.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Purple Plum\\&quot; turns out ink blue. I would recommend adding some hot pink dye  if you&#x27;re set on using this brand.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used N&#x27;Rage dyes, and I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. As others have said, the swatch at the store was a lovely vibrant purple, with magenta undertones.&lt;br /&gt;The dye IS thick, but it&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip or run like some of the thinner dyes. I squeezed it into a small glass bowl, so I didn&#x27;t have the issues with getting it out of the bottle while applying like others had.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to leaving veggie based dyes on for hours, but the dark blue color that came out of the bottle worried me and I only left it on for about 20 minutes. Rinsing the dye out left my tub varying shades of blue, teal, and green...which worried me even more. Despite using cold water, the dye never stopped bleeding. First dark blue, then lighter blue, and finally a lovely shade of teal. Lovely as it may have been...I wanted purple hair, not blue hair, and since the swatch showed me purple with a red base - NOT a blue base - this is upsetting.&lt;br /&gt;Despite rinsing my hair under warm (and then hot) water for half an hour, shampooing twice, and conditioning twice, my hair is still a VERY dark shade of blue. So dark, that unless I&#x27;m in direct light, it looks black.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to hoping that it actually does fade to something resembling purple.&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I feel like this is false advertising. Between the name, and the swatch, why would I expect to get dark blue hair? I didn&#x27;t. N&#x27;Rage should seriously consider updating their swatches to reflect the actual colors of their dyes on bleached hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sally Beauty Supply and was told by the worker that it turns out purple, not true. I tested it on a small area of my hair just to be sure, and sure enough it came out ink blue. Hoping that I can achieve the purple I want by mixing in some pink.</li>
    <li> Purchased the purple plum at Sally&#x27;s. As the instruction said I did not mix with anything. I&#x27;m used to temporary colors that fade after a certain number of washes and I understand they don&#x27;t  lighten your hair. That&#x27;s why I thought this product was supposed to work - purple plum is way darker than my hair; my hair is medium brown. Since there is still a good amount in the bottle I will try again, maybe bleaching the hair or mixing with peroxide. But, I don&#x27;t recommend it for those who do not want to go through the trouble of bleaching.</li>
    <li> This really last.  For the first 3 weeks looked more like a dark blue but  has faded now to a pretty purple.</li>
    <li> By far the best dye ive used</li>
    <li> This came out straight up blue, which is fine if that&#x27;s what you want. When I buy something that says it&#x27;s purple I expect there to be some red in there, it&#x27;s just blue. Thankfully I had some pink manic panic laying around and was able to mix to achieve a true purple color. Just be warned for those of us who are picky about our colors</li>
    <li> This may seem very different from other peoples reviews, but I think the Purple Plum color is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I first dyed it, it was dark navy blue (or as others say, ink blue). I couldn&#x27;t care less because it was quite a beautiful color. It stained a little, too. After a couple of washes it turned regular purple and lasted many many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this dye, so I&#x27;ll see if the turquoise will work for me ;)</li>
    <li> I have used N&#x27;rage dye before and loved it. In fact, I purchased the exact colors that I have previously used. Unfortunately, after buying this dye and using it my hair was royal blue, not purple. The dye quickly washed away and faded into a bright blue. True N&#x27;rage dye has previously lasted in my hair for months, and when the plum color began to fade after over a month of washes, it became a pinker version....as you would expect purple to fade.&lt;br /&gt;While my stylist and I are responsible for not noticing sooner... I was sold fake N&#x27;rage dye, and not even the color that I intended to purchase. I highly recommend the actual dye, but strongly discourage purchase from an online seller after my experience.</li>
    <li> if I could give it 10 stars, I would. this is the best dye I&#x27;ve ever used. not only does it work well, and lasts, it smells AMAZING!!! every time I would dye my hair my family would love to sniff the bottle of dye. I&#x27;ve used plum purple for 2 years. I have medium length thick hair, it only takes a quarter of the bottle to dye my whole head. this is well worth the almost 15 dollars for a tube. when I use this dye, I can go 2 months before I need to redo my hair (with roots and evening out the color) which is amazing , compared to ion brilliance where you need to do it almost twice a month. the picture is what it looked like right after dying and drying. except for the bangs, I used a different dye for them. I left the dye in for 7 hours.</li>
    <li> BEST HAIR DYE EVER.  Awesome color, don&#x27;t even need to bleach your hair if you don&#x27;t want to, and fades in SUCH a cool way.  Like blues and pinks and turquoise and greens.  People have been asking me how I did it and I&#x27;m like uhhhh it just faded rainbow.  If purple/blue/greens could look natural… this dye does that...</li>
    <li> I had a really pretty shade of lavender, that I got from Manic Panic Purple Haze.  I tried Purple Plum from N Rage, and it turned my hair BLUE.  Not even a purple-ish blue, straight-up, blue.  Very disappointed in the misleading color.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I brought the red! There are NO instructions on how to mix the product or what to use to even start!!!</li>
    <li> This was literally the worst dye I&#x27;ve ever tried...and I&#x27;ve been dying my hair crazy colors for almost ten years. I lightened my hair to the right shade of blonde, then put the Purple Plum over it. I left it on for about 45 minutes. When I rinsed it out, I looked in the mirror and my hair was not purple...it was BLACK. On top of this, the dye severely stained my skin and my entire bathroom. I spent literally two hours cleaning up and bleaching my bathtub. DO NOT buy this dye.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend helped me do this color last night. Love the thickness of the product - makes it easy to handle and unlikely to drip, unlike some others. (We did laugh at the instructions to \\&quot;shake well\\&quot;, however.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did it over the remnants of some other colors, some extremely faded demi-permanent blue and some fresh Kool-Aid red. It took beautifully over all that and also over my dark roots. It does bleed a lot when wet, or at least it did last night, perhaps just because it&#x27;s so fresh. Anyway, it produced a fantastic dark purple that could be mistaken for black depending on light and distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did have one very weird moment, though. The instructions say that heat is not necessary, but they don&#x27;t warn against using heat. So, knowing that we wouldn&#x27;t be able to leave it in as long as I usually prefer (and that the \\&quot;15 minutes\\&quot; recommended on the bottle usually applies to pre-bleached hair and a pastel shade), we started to use a hair dryer to try and set the dye a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a moment my girlfriend said, with an odd tone in her voice, \\&quot;Parts of it look green.\\&quot; After a minute she stopped and said, \\&quot;I can see it changing - it&#x27;s the heat that&#x27;s doing it.\\&quot; A very Dean Stockwell moment. There&#x27;s no mirror in the laundry room where we were dyeing, so I can&#x27;t say what it looked like, but she was pretty emphatic about it. At any rate, there was no trace of green when we washed it out... maybe it was just a trick of the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;d be interested to hear if anyone else has encountered this phenomenon, or can explain it. And I think maybe i&#x27;ll have to go see if Netflix has a copy of \\&quot;The Boy With Green Hair\\&quot;. :)</li>
    <li> I used to have a deep purple color in my hair and I absolutely loved it, but my job hated it, so I had to say goodbye. Well, now that I work for a place that doesn&#x27;t have strict rules for hair color, I immediately had to go back! I&#x27;ve never been so in love with my hair color. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t remember how I got that gorgeous color. So, I went and bought Purple Plum because I&#x27;ve read great reviews on N Rage products, plus it&#x27;s Not semi-permanent. Which a lot of unnatural colors are. It completely turned my hair BLUE. I am so angry, AND I cannot get rid of it. I&#x27;ve read that the blue will fade into purple, but I don&#x27;t want blue hair, I want purple. I also don&#x27;t want to wait weeks until my desired color may or may not show up. Such a waste of money. My hair was lightened, and properly prepared for a color, and now I can&#x27;t get rid of this icky blue! Please, don&#x27;t buy the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34;. It is NOT purple. The pros? It smell decent, like bubblegum, but really chemically smelling bubblegum. Just do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t if deep purple is what you want.</li>
    <li> Of all hair dyes i&#x27;ve tried, this has by far been my favorite! It&#x27;s not really a red based purple and has some blue undertones, so on my hair it came out a blueish purple, but still easily identified as purple. I will agree that the product is very thick but on my long hair I only used about half the bottle. It&#x27;s thick but a little goes a long way. I think it&#x27;s important to point out that you really have to work the product into your hair. I massage piece by piece until my entire head is saturated. My hair was bleached before I used this and I would recommend a pale yellow to white for best results. I wouldn&#x27;t use a developer regardless of strength because you don&#x27;t want to damage your hair any more if you do have already bleached hair. I usually wash my hair and let it air dry before applying. Clean hair makes for better results. It will bleed onto anything and everything. I suggest vaseline or aquaphor around your hair line and ears to minimizing staining. I tend to wear dark clothes so the staining hasn&#x27;t really been a problem for me. I usually leave it on for about 2-3 hours under a hair cap and if i&#x27;m not feeling too lazy I&#x27;ll apply heat.To wash it out, I have a removable shower head so I usually bend over the tub as close to the drain and rinse out with the coldest water possible, I don&#x27;t shampoo since my hair was clean prior to using the dye. I wrap my hair in a dark towel and apply some leave in  conditioner. I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic, Splat, ion, color jamz, and this by far has had the longest lasting power. On several occasions i&#x27;ve used those products and the color stopped sticking to my hair so although it&#x27;s a little annoying the thickness of N&#x27;rage for me is a plus. For upkeep I wash my hair with purple shampoo or a sulfate free shampoo with cold water, for in between washes I use hair powder or dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this hair dye because she wanted to dye her ends purple. This dye came out bright blue when she put it on her hair. Even though it wasn&#x27;t true to color, this dye lasted long and had a lovely bubble gum scent. Don&#x27;t use this dye if you&#x27;re looking for a vibrant purple because that isn&#x27;t what you will get.</li>
    <li> Expected purple results, got blue. Un-bleached hair turned out dark midnight blue, almost black. On bleached hair, medium turquoise blue. Not purple at all. Not by any stretch of the imagination. Should&#x27;ve used Pravanna. Licensed cosmetologist, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> When I first put in the dye it was a dark blue but after like a week of washing my hair it started to look purple there are good things about this dye but the one big fault is that it&#x27;s not purple until it starts to fade</li>
    <li> I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty because I wanted a new look. The brand I originally was going to get didn&#x27;t look right on the swatch. I saw the swatch for this and fell so in love with it. I risked bleaching my black hair for this color and i&#x27;m so happy my hair didn&#x27;t fall out because i would have been devastated with this out come. I added conditioner to it because it looked really dark. That didn&#x27;t work so I went with it anyway. As I was putting it on my hair it looked blue and not purple. I just kept going (i had faith). i rinsed the color out and it was BLUE!!  no purple what so ever!!! it didn&#x27;t even look like i dyed my hair. even in bright light. I&#x27;m so disappointed. This did not work for my hair AT ALL!!!!</li>
    <li> This dye is AMAZING in my hair! I have to bleach my hair before, and let the dye set for the full time. This color lasts in my hair for 12 weeks! It starts out very dark shimmery plum purple, and fades out over those weeks to a beautiful fuchsia color.</li>
    <li> Purple plum is NOT PURPLE.&lt;br /&gt;Its BLUE.&lt;br /&gt;While I wanted purple.. I kept it and use it as a toner.&lt;br /&gt;Mix with white shampoo and conditioner and you have a nice blonde toner.</li>
    <li> Worst hair dye ever!  I hate this stuff im so pissed it makes me wanna cry every time i take a shower. I don&#x27;t know if its just my luck or what but this hair dye stained everything my bathtub, my face hands neck n shoulders every time i take a shower this happens. 😣😭 I hate it! And i bleach blonde my hair to dye it this color n it came out blue n i order it plum PURPLE so angery. I Hate this product never using ever again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible don&#x27;t buy it its not purple its a lie its blue and green mixed together so bad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years in the same color and I get compliments everywhere I go! Love it and it doesn&#x27;t damage hair!!!</li>
    <li> We have tried&lt;br /&gt;Manic Panic : Don&#x27;t even bother.  There is no color after the first wash, unless you leave it on without rinsing for like a whole day. (Colors tried: Lizard Green and Pink)&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Zone : Better but still washes out quite quickly - almost all color gone in 4 washes or less. (colors: purple haze and red)&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;N Rage : Best we have tried! Even stays through a couple of swims! (colors: puple plum, twisted teal and a pink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair I pre lighten/bleach as my hair is light brown/dark blonde - apply dye (use gloves!) wrap in aluminum foil leave for 20-30 minutes, rinse out with just water, blow dry.  All brands have left dye on my towels.  My daughters have lighter hair and I do not prelighten their hair.  We all hold the color for about 2 months (with &#x27;n rage), unless there is swimming - then all bets are off.  I haven&#x27;t tried splat! yet.  But will be sticking with &#x27;N Rage for the colors they have I like.  Oh, we also tried Color Ion from Sally&#x27;s the other day.  Dyed beautifully but not sure how it is holding up as my daughter left to visit Grandma that same night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: To remove dye from skin - use hand sanitizer.  Best I have found at removing dye -- doesn&#x27;t work on hands that applied dye without gloves however, just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> N&#x27;rage lasts longer in my hair than any other product. I use the bubblegum pink,but have used plum in the past. It is thick and easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or pillows in spite of being intense long lasting color.</li>
    <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve used so far. It does stain the bath tub when you rinse though.</li>
    <li> This product is freaking awesome.i bought the purple plum color but I had to bleach my hair since I have dark hair but once I applied the color it was such a nice dark purple color and i loved that as time went on and the color faded it turned into a nice light purple. I don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t evenly bleach everything or something but Eventually over a few months as it was the purple was fading, some parts of my hair had streaks of her hot pink, tourquoise, blue and even a nice green color. I didn&#x27;t know it was gonna turn out that way but I LOVED how it looked and how I technically paid for one color and ended up getting four! Haha&lt;br /&gt;I just bought another purple plum and I&#x27;m praying that I get the same results and same colors as it fades and washes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love N&#x27;Rage &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It sticks good but should not be labled purple plum it is very very blue.</li>
    <li> I tried 3 different brands, with this one being BY FAR the most successful.  I have dark, dark brown hair, but with LOTS and LOTS of warm tones, and even after bleaching twice, there&#x27;s still a yellow tint to my hair.  I could tone it to the correct color but I&#x27;m too lazy, so I wanted/needed/was looking for a purple with a blue base instead of a purple base.  The first two purple shades I tried left a pinkish and even almost orange tint to it in places that were&#x27;nt as light as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this color and left it on for nearly an hour, and as others stated, once I rinsed, I was rather shocked to see that the dyed portion was nearly indistinguishable from the rest of my hair when it was wet.  Even upon drying, my hair was, in fact, dark, dark blue, but for me that was still better than the orange alternative.  It stays dark for a little bit, but after a couple of weeks starts to fade to a REALLY, REALLY pretty and intense dark purple.  It was easy to apply with a tinting brush, and it smells like bubble gum, which I know some have said they didn&#x27;t like, but I liked it FAR better than a couple of the other colors I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does stain pretty bad, so you have to be careful to make sure it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere it&#x27;s not supposed to go.  Also, I rinse my hair THOROUGHLY (read - obsessively) after a dye job, and color was still coming out on the 4th wash.  Usually the MAX I have color rinsing out that I can see is 2 washes.  But I haven&#x27;t noticed it bleeding or transferring to anything from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you REALLY REALLY don&#x27;t want to have the bluish tone in the beginning, I would recommend mixing in some pink or magenta just to balance.  All in all though, I&#x27;ve been looking for the right purple, and with my skin tone, even with the blue at the beginning, this IS the right purple and I&#x27;ll likely be sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I used Cobalt Blue over a failed attempt at Manic Panic&#x27;s Rockabilly Blue. (It was a light gray color at that point) It worked pretty well, although some areas are MUCH more vibrant than others. A majority is a strange midnight blue, which I like, and since the most vibrant is in the front it looks like it was done on purpose. However, it bleeds EVERYWHERE. It dyed my white iPod case, my hands, my ears, and parts of my tub. I slept with a towel around my head last night in fear of ruining my pillowcase. In order to stop most of the bleeding, you have to scrub your scalp a lot, for at LEAST 20 minutes. I used shampoo at first, but it didn&#x27;t get all of it out. So then I mercilessly scrubbed my hair and scalp with tons of conditioner, and it appears to have stopped bleeding. In short, it got a color, but it wasn&#x27;t completely vibrant everywhere(probably my fault, because of the gray) and it bled EVERYWHERE.</li>
    <li> My favorite blue or purple hair dye. It kind of has a geode effect on my hair because it wasn&#x27;t evenly bleached to one set color before using this dye.  My natural hair is medium red/brown. When I use this dye, my &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; hair is a violet plum color as opposed to a magenta plum. Definitely a more blue purple and I adore it. I have long hair that is not super thick or super thin, one bottle works adequately. I have tried the conditioner trick people recommend to make the consistency of the dye more manageable but the dye, while still pretty, is not as bold. I prefer bold. Just pretend you are getting ketchup out of a stubborn bottle, shake it upside down angrily. Not a huge deal. Cover everything. Wear gloves! Wear gloves when you wash the dye out the first two washes, in fact. The first couple of washes, if you are keeping your hair down, wear a t-shirt you don&#x27;t care about. If you are going to bed with wet hair, again, for the first couple of washes, be mindful of your pillowcase. I put a dry towel over my pillow. I have expensive sheets and have not ruined them. It hasn&#x27;t stained my shower but the first couple of washes, I use my kitchen sink because it is a smurf-death. In case anyone is curious about maintenance product, I really dig the ion color sealer. In the beginning, I was quite diligent with using color safe shampoo but now I just use whatever. The dye rules, man. When it does fade, it is still so pretty, but I don&#x27;t think I noticed the fancy shampoo keeping it bold longer so... Oh, and be prepared to smell like a blow-pop for a week. Could be worse.</li>
    <li> This is the best \\&quot;crazy color\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried manic panic and some others and they all wash out within a few days. This one is a bit more expensive, but worth it. I am a hairdresser myself and I recommend this. The purple is pretty dark at first (almost dark blue) but then as it fades it gets lighter. To prolong the color in my hair I wash it with cool water and wash it quickly! The longer the shampoo sits on your hair, the more the dye will come out. I usually don&#x27;t even have to re-color this for a month or so. And even then it&#x27;s still a vibrant purple. Love this stuff! And it smells good also.</li>
