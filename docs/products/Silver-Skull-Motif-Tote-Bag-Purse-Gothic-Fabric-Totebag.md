      <li>I LOVE THE LOOK OF THE BAG</li>
      <li>its a cute bag.</li>
      <li>is ok for</li>
      <li>I was expecting a more durable tote.</li>
      <li>It has a formed bottom so it actually holds more and is perfect for using as a shopping tote.</li>
      <li>this bag is really cute.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>cute bag....</li>
      <li>and i love</li>
      <li>This bag is cheap and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I were you!</li>
      <li>its kind of like a velvet material but cheaply made.</li>
      <li>It came very quick.</li>
      <li>Oh well, it&#x27;s still super cute and functional.</li>
      <li>I saw this, was fairly cheap ($4.00), so I nabbed it.</li>
      <li>this bag was dirt cheap, came in a timely manner</li>
      <li>I honestly thought for the price, it would not be very sturdy.</li>
      <li>I received this bag and loved it, but not too many uses later the insert started to pull away.</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive the bag.</li>
      <li>This bag was super cheap.</li>
      <li>I would enjoy this bag so much when it came as a gift!</li>
      <li>im kind of embarrassed to give this as a present...</li>
      <li>It is very nice, but it was not meant to hold anything very heavy.</li>
      <li>Despite the cute skulls I sent it back.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>and it comes back for more</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you buy something from online without ever seeing it in person first.</li>
      <li>I love the bag to death, it&#x27;s super cute, and getting it was a breeze, but the only thing is that it was not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lined with some kind of thin polyester and has a zipper at the top.</li>
      <li>It is not meant to put much into it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better quality than I expected for the price.</li>
      <li>this product never said how really durable it is</li>
      <li>it feels like velvet but really dont know what it is</li>
      <li>I originally bought this as I thought it was an actual purse.</li>
      <li>I use this bag to carry books around at book sales and so far it has held up pretty well.</li>
      <li>i usually go thru 1 work bag a year, if it lasts that long, i&#x27;ll be happy, even if it dosen&#x27;t</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ll still be happy, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
      <li>So, if you want a cool looking bag, but don&#x27;t really plan on trying to put more than a magazine or book into it, this is the bag for you.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry, but I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>The bag was a lot smaller than I was anticipating, was clearly not well made, and had a strong chemical odor.  </li>
      <li>I did all this because I had a feeling the strap was going to break, and yet it still broke, even though I took nearly everything out of it when I used it!</li>
      <li>Material is a little cheap.</li>
      <li>So far, the handles have stood up to quite a bit of abuse.</li>
      <li>Busy mom with books, calenders and folders, needed a hip bag to keep it all out of the floor of my car.</li>
      <li>I was surprised.</li>
      <li>Even if I had a use for a small cheap bag, this thing is over-priced for what you get.</li>
      <li>Wal-mart bookbag allready fell apart, this thing looks barely used.</li>
      <li>The skulls are larger now and the material not as soft.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 &amp; 1/2 weeks and the lining has already completely ripped out.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 &amp; 1/2 weeks and the lining has already completely ripped out.  </li>
<li> Oh, and also, the skulls are a shiny metallic silver color and not white, I don&#x27;t really care, but someone might, and also, mine did smell funky, but only for the first day, then I never smelled the weird fishy smell again.</li>
<li> i don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but i have a lot of stuff in it and it seems to be study enough.</li>
<li> After a few uses, the lining started tearing, so I just tore it out completely.</li>
<li> Only problem I have is the lining, other than that I rate 5 stars cause it does serve it&#x27;s purpose</li>
<li> And I only used it a couple times, and only for papers, nothing heavy.</li>
<li> It is a little more flashy than I had expected.</li>
<li> also the black on the outside does rub off.</li>
<li> , i only know that the black rubs off and sheds.</li>
<li> As soon as I put my stuff in it, such as wallet, cell phone, and a little bag containing (lip gloss, tide pen, gum, and pens)</li>
<li> seems to be sturdy enough to withstand everyday use.</li>
<li> I actually think it&#x27;s better without it, but others might find it annoying.    </li>
<li> outside of the bag is nice but it smells awful</li>
<li> NOT WORTH IT,</li>
<li> My only complaint is the color.</li>
<li> the material on the outside is odd and the lining sucks.</li>
<li> I was using it for school, and one of the straps broke on me the other day while walking to one of my classes!</li>
<li> And it came in less than a week.</li>
<li> its roomy, yep its silver, with black.</li>
<li> The material is a little like felt and does attract A LOT of animal hair if you have any, just a warning.</li>
<li> having used this bag for only 3 weeks and its already broken ....</li>
<li> I usually need 3 of them in class and the bag does not fit all of my notebooks with them, I ended up carrying all the textbooks and just keeping my folders, binders, and notebooks inside.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve ordered two in the past.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it now.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only had the bag for 2 weeks, and the lining on the inside is gone, and one of the straps are completely useless!</li>
<li> In about 3weeks the inner liner started pulling apart :(</li>
<li> I use it everyday!!!</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t see that this bag was silver in the bottom description, and DO THEY MEAN SILVER!</li>
<li> but the fabric is so thin.</li>
<li> the straps are too thin as well.</li>
<li> SAD N UPSET....</li>
<li> ITS SAD</li>
<li> poorly made!</li>
<li> and the inside is very poorly made.</li>
<li> however it stinks like fish (as others have said here).</li>

    <li> My daughter wanted a tote instead of a bookbag. I had a very short time and was low on cash to get it. I saw this, was fairly cheap ($4.00), so I nabbed it. I honestly thought for the price, it would not be very sturdy. I was surprised. She crams all kinds of things in there, throws it around, leaves it outside in the rain. Can&#x27;t tell. Wal-mart bookbag allready fell apart, this thing looks barely used. And it came in less than a week. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE LOOK OF THE BAG BUT IT TORE THE 1ST DAY I GOT IT AND I WAS SO UPSET BUT THATS WHAT HAPPENES WHEN YOU PAY ON 7-8.OO...SO nyway,im sick of buying things off the internet and it ends up... poorly made! ITS SAD BECAUSE I LIKE IT ALOT.TOO BADITS A PIECE of junk</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two in the past.  The skulls are larger now and the material not as soft.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> its a cute bag. cought it for around 3 bucks. the material on the outside is odd and the lining sucks. the straps are too thin as well. also, it smelled like fish. i grabbed my best perfum and soaked the bag practically. holds up but i wouldnt stick anything valuable in it if you dont want it damaged when the straps break.</li>
    <li> I thought that the purse was going to be smaller but instead it&#x27;s kinda like a overnight bag.</li>
    <li> I love the bag to death, it&#x27;s super cute, and getting it was a breeze, but the only thing is that it was not exactly what I was expecting. I was expecting a more durable tote. It is very nice, but it was not meant to hold anything very heavy. I was using it for school, and one of the straps broke on me the other day while walking to one of my classes! I&#x27;ve only had the bag for 2 weeks, and the lining on the inside is gone, and one of the straps are completely useless! Now I&#x27;m screwed and without a bag this semester! I&#x27;m taking four classes, so I have 4 textbooks. I usually need 3 of them in class and the bag does not fit all of my notebooks with them, I ended up carrying all the textbooks and just keeping my folders, binders, and notebooks inside. I did all this because I had a feeling the strap was going to break, and yet it still broke, even though I took nearly everything out of it when I used it! I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you buy something from online without ever seeing it in person first. I would only recommend this tote to someone who really doesn&#x27;t need to carry anything heavy. Oh, and also, the skulls are a shiny metallic silver color and not white, I don&#x27;t really care, but someone might, and also, mine did smell funky, but only for the first day, then I never smelled the weird fishy smell again. I didn&#x27;t have to spray anything on it at all, I just assumed that the smell was from the packaging and just go away, and it did.</li>
    <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do this bad justice.  The skulls are a wonderful flat metallic color and the detail is awesome. I had no idea I would enjoy this bag so much when it came as a gift!</li>
    <li> This bag holds A LOT!!! It has a formed bottom so it actually holds more and is perfect for using as a shopping tote.</li>
    <li> very cute bag however it stinks like fish (as others have said here). i did not have a problem with the fuzz rubbing off yet. seems to be sturdy enough to withstand everyday use.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag because I thought it was different.  As soon as I put my stuff in it, such as wallet, cell phone, and a little bag containing (lip gloss, tide pen, gum, and pens) the liner instantly ripped when I tried to zip it shut!  This bag is cheap and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I were you!</li>
    <li> I got this tote to use for shopping. Those reusable bags they sell at supermarkets are just so unsightly. It is perfect for my purposes and fits a decent amount of groceries. Plus, it has shiny, silver skulls on it!    So far, the handles have stood up to quite a bit of abuse. The inside lining, however, is a different story. After a few uses, the lining started tearing, so I just tore it out completely. I actually think it&#x27;s better without it, but others might find it annoying.    I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a purse, but for carrying groceries, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> cute bag....BUT... i had to let this bag air out..it had an odor something bad.... after using this bag for 1 week the liner ripped out! im so mad. i payed 30.00 plus shipping:( i went to open my purse last night and the zipper part busted away from the side. having used this bag for only 3 weeks and its already broken ....NOT WORTH IT, SAD N UPSET....BUMMER</li>
    <li> I received this bag and loved it, but not too many uses later the insert started to pull away. It is not meant to put much into it. So, if you want a cool looking bag, but don&#x27;t really plan on trying to put more than a magazine or book into it, this is the bag for you.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry, but I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this as I thought it was an actual purse. I ended up using this as my sons &amp;#34;travel bag&amp;#34; for extra clothes, toys, snacks etc. it&#x27;s super cute and feels fairly sturdy.</li>
    <li> this bag is really cute. the skulls are silver which is awesome. but it smells like fish. i sprayed it with perfume we&#x27;ll see how that works. also the black on the outside does rub off. its kind of like a velvet material but cheaply made. i paid $1.99. can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> outside of the bag is nice but it smells awful im kind of embarrassed to give this as a present... and the inside is very poorly made.</li>
    <li> its a well made bag but would not of bought it if i would have known what it was made of. it feels like velvet but really dont know what it is, i only know that the black rubs off and sheds. bad choice if you are going to wear red or white. its sitting in the back of my closet collecting dust.</li>
    <li> Loved the pattern. Material is a little cheap. In about 3weeks the inner liner started pulling apart :(</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive the bag. It came very quick. I was happy about that. I wish I would have read the reviews, however, because the bag has a velvety feel and the skulls are shiny silver. It is a little more flashy than I had expected. I will probably continue to use it until I find something else.</li>
    <li> this bag was dirt cheap, came in a timely manner and i love it.&lt;br /&gt;i use it for work. its roomy, yep its silver, with black. mine dosen&#x27;t seem to shed and it dosen&#x27;t smell fishy either. i don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but i have a lot of stuff in it and it seems to be study enough. i usually go thru 1 work bag a year, if it lasts that long, i&#x27;ll be happy, even if it dosen&#x27;t i&#x27;ll still be happy, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. satisfied.</li>
    <li> This bag is well made and the skulls are great fun!  We plan to use this bag all of the time!  It&#x27;s a great bag - we especially like the pocket - perfect for a phone!</li>
    <li> is ok for but  the price you would think it would be made of heavier cotton or some sterdier  materials</li>
    <li> This bag was super cheap. It&#x27;s lined with some kind of thin polyester and has a zipper at the top. It seems moderately sturdy and will probably hold up.     My only complaint is the color. I didn&#x27;t see that this bag was silver in the bottom description, and DO THEY MEAN SILVER! The skulls are metallic silver -- lots of shine and bling. I was going to use this as a purse. I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it now. Oh well, it&#x27;s still super cute and functional. I wish the skulls were white. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Great bag very nice love the skulls on it. Use it every day. Would tell everyone to get one and use it.</li>
    <li> This is a well-made tote. I carry my laptop computer in this which suits my needs and is groovy to boot!</li>
    <li> This is totally cute, but unfortunately, you get what you pay for w/ this.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 &amp; 1/2 weeks and the lining has already completely ripped out.  And I only used it a couple times, and only for papers, nothing heavy.</li>
    <li> This bag is very cute. It&#x27;s better quality than I expected for the price. I use this bag to carry books around at book sales and so far it has held up pretty well. The material is a little like felt and does attract A LOT of animal hair if you have any, just a warning. But otherwise it&#x27;s a great bag for the money.</li>
    <li> Busy mom with books, calenders and folders, needed a hip bag to keep it all out of the floor of my car. This bag shipped the day after I ordered and was here two days later!</li>
    <li> The bag was a lot smaller than I was anticipating, was clearly not well made, and had a strong chemical odor.  Despite the cute skulls I sent it back.  Even if I had a use for a small cheap bag, this thing is over-priced for what you get.</li>
    <li> this product never said how really durable it is i have drug it slung it flung it and it comes back for more</li>
    <li> Only problem I have is the lining, other than that I rate 5 stars cause it does serve it&#x27;s purpose</li>
    <li> I still love it! I use it everyday!!! For the price, I&#x27;m very happy!!!</li>
    <li> Love it but the fabric is so thin. I hope its durable.</li>
    <li> great bag for a two day trip or to carry your stuff in or a trip to the library for more books and it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.</li>
