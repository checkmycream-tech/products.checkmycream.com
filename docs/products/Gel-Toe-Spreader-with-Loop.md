      <li>Much more comfortable with this.  </li>
      <li>I ordered another product that wrapped my toe with cloth and that was much more comfortable.</li>

      <li>Comfortable to wear.  </li>

      <li>With smaller toes, not as good.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I tried this and just ordered  several more.</li>
      <li>The loop is pretty comfortable, but moves around easier than I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>Really stopping overlap problem and easy to wear all day in all shoes except sandals of course</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, convenient, and it works very well.</li>
      <li>The gel toe spreaders are soft and fits well with most of my shoes.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t find useful.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>The forth  toe on my right foot is kind of sliding below the third toe and the nail cuts a bit.</li>
      <li>the price seemed right.</li>
      <li>I started using this product because my second toe was getting over my big toe, and it&#x27;s working very good, I can use it all day with all my shoes, even when I run, and my toe seems to be getting better, I&#x27;ve been using it every day all day long for 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s very soft and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I ordered these and they came very fast.</li>
      <li>I am an above knee amputee, so my \\&quot;sound\\&quot; foot bears more weight than it would if I had both legs.  </li>
      <li>It is soft and comfortable to wear.  </li>
      <li>, it is exactly what I have been looking for</li>
      <li>Seems this has cost me way too much time, and no resolution!</li>
      <li>This time the loop that holds the spacer in place broke the first time I wore it.  </li>
      <li>a pliable, soft and comfortable when you wear them with shoes.</li>
      <li>The one that stays better is the one with the gel that loops around the big toe and has gel over the joint as well.</li>
      <li>For toes of a certain age, this product is helpful to realign the toe and keep it from touching the next one.</li>
      <li>They are very large, but extremely soft, so I was glad they had extra bulk.</li>
      <li>I barely notice them when wearing them other than the pleasant feeling of having straight toes.</li>
      <li>In the case of larger toes they were fine.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to try them inside my ballet shoes since I have bunions - and they&#x27;re better than the loose gel inserts that you can use, but they still moved too much to dance with (I kept adjusting them during class).</li>
      <li>Toe spreaders were very helpful for my wife.  </li>
      <li>Helps straighten my bunion toe out and that helps my whole foot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wear it every work day, stand 11 hours a day, comforting.</li>
    <li> The item exceeded my expectations the gel toe spreader with loop is very comfortable to wear on my foot to help with my foot pain.</li>
    <li> This has been a life-saver for me providing me with relief from pain in my big toe and foot.  Well desinged, very comfortable.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I like them&lt;br /&gt; a little soft  but think that has to that way.</li>
    <li> the item in photo looks a bit different that what was received....product works ok... is better than not having it.</li>
    <li> love this product.  the loop anchors it in place so it can be worn without socks and it won&#x27;t fall off.  i wear it the whole night.  it prevents day time tenderness at the big toe joint.  once in a while i have worn it during the day in my running shoes, and even that wasn&#x27;t too uncofortable.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS ON MY TOES, WAS WHAT I ORDERED, CAME ON TIME. AND ANY ONE WITH OVERLAPING TOES, THEY NEED TO TRY THIS.</li>
    <li> chokes the toe with the ring.</li>
    <li> Price was a bit ridiculous (was $13 when i purchases) but this little thing does wonders. I wear it around my house when im not wearing shoes and it helps a great deal with the pain on the bottom of my foot caused from the bone in my big toe growing twisted. Would def recommend!</li>
    <li> Loop all ripped off. useless, waste of money.They are not working out. Looks good bad design. The &#x27;&#x27;Gel Toe Spreader&#x27;&#x27;  holds way better.</li>
    <li> The toe stays too moist with this.  Sores between won&#x27;t heal as a result of this.</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered the toe spreader in 2014, it was the perfect size for your interior toes. The company has now doubled the size of the toe spreader, making it too big for all except the big toe. It is very disappointing that no notice or choice of size was given.</li>
    <li> These are great! I like a lot!</li>
    <li> This is the best separator I&#x27;ve ever found. It stays in place, unlike those that just sit between your toes. It doesn&#x27;t cut off circulation, like those that fit around the big toe. Glad I found them.</li>
    <li> Lasted one week then ripped and is unwearable.  Too bad because it worked very well.  If it was better made, I would reconmend it</li>
    <li> Toe spreaders were very helpful for my wife.  She has been suffering from hammertoe and these little toe spreaders relieve the discomfort.</li>
    <li> Helps straighten my bunion toe out and that helps my whole foot. I bought these from a specialty store for a lot more. This is a very good price for these and will be buying more. I&#x27;ve tried other versions but they were either uncomfortable or hard to use. I can actually wear these in my shoes if I want. Generally, I only put it on at night.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find useful. Would not stay in place. Gel was too &amp;#34;squishy.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for almost a month and I have only seen a very little (to no) difference. I&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these!  Loop stretches easily to put on toe.  Very comfortable for wearing all day.  Easy to clean - just wash them when washing hands.  Helps to have shoes with enough room for your toes to spread a bit.  I&#x27;m buying more because I&#x27;m afraid this product will disappear from the marketplace.  Sure can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and have not heard too much back from my mother-n-law.  So, it must be just ok.</li>
    <li> It is too thick and hurt my other toe.  I cannot use it.</li>
    <li> I will never buy this product again because it was torn after wearing for 8 hour overnight.  The Gel is too soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them before and find they are about the best thing I can use for my toe. Nothing really works but this comes close.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to wear.  Giving it time to work.</li>
    <li> I had bunion surgery about 3 weeks ago and my doctor put my in the Darco splint 2 weeks ago. Anyways, I have dissolvable stitches and the splint was not allowing enough air to get to the scar, it felt so covered (I don&#x27;t really know if air should be getting to it or not, but it&#x27;s healing). I ordered these and they are so cozy and comfortable! I wish it was just a tad wider, but I like it anyway</li>
    <li> This toe spreader easy to use, easy to clean, easy to wear with any socks &amp; shoes.  It is comfortable but you can always feel it.  It may not stay on without socks (depends on your toes). I am not sure if it eases foot pain or not, but it certainly does not make it any worse.  I have to think that it is helping but I haven&#x27;t had them that long.</li>
    <li> .  Helps to take the pressure off of the bunion.  The toe loop may be a little tight for some people.</li>
    <li> Besides being very flimsy, the product slips around on the toe and does not do a good job of holding the toes apart.  Over priced for what you get.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.  There are better products out there for less money.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT MET MY EXPECTATIONS. I WILL RECOMMEND AND BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  Too big for 2nd toe, too small for big toe and I have small feet.  Very expensive for quality.  Can buy better quality elsewhere on Amazon.  Very disappointed.  I have been wearing these for about a year and the place I used to get them stopped carrying them.  Was very glad to find them here, just not from this seller.  Sad because the seller was great, just poor quality product.</li>
    <li> After having surgery for a bunion, I still need to keep my big toe from being pushed into the others when wearing shoes.  This works so much better than the one the doctor provided me, which had to be held in place with tape.  It&#x27;s comfortable, convenient, and it works very well.</li>
    <li> Actually this product is a zero.  It is white and not clear like the photo.  Very inferior to those sold in the USA.</li>
    <li> however, it doesn&#x27;t offer much separation, and it&#x27;s a bit too&lt;br /&gt;pliable. Because it&#x27;s so pliable, or soft, it doesn&#x27;t seem to&lt;br /&gt;do much separating.</li>
    <li> Items as described,gently put them on, no problem with quality.</li>
    <li> A little uncomfortable and it doesn&#x27;t stay in place , seems like it might tear as the material is thin</li>
    <li> I started using this product because my second toe was getting over my big toe, and it&#x27;s working very good, I can use it all day with all my shoes, even when I run, and my toe seems to be getting better, I&#x27;ve been using it every day all day long for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> These spreaders were a Godsend! I noticed my pinky toe starting to curl up under the 4th toe. I ordered these and they came very fast. I have US size 11 Wide feet and ordered the large. I barely notice them when wearing them other than the pleasant feeling of having straight toes. After about a week of wearing them I&#x27;ve noticed the pinky toes are already much straighter when they are off. They are very large, but extremely soft, so I was glad they had extra bulk. I highly recommend these to anyone with need to straighten some toes!</li>
    <li> The material is too thick - it is uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I have a painful bunion on one foot and I wear this every day, all day. It has provided tremendous relief, and it&#x27;s so comfortable, you don&#x27;t even realize you&#x27;re wearing it. I live in Florida so I wear flip-flops 95% of the time, and this gel toe spreader works great with them.</li>
    <li> Not good, doesn&#x27;t make finger separate from crossing on one another. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
    <li> Makes it easy to align the toes and give space while I dance.</li>
    <li> I ordered the small size and they were huge silicone rings almost the size of the ring candy lollipop.  It absolutely does not look like the picture.  So be careful what you are buying because it&#x27;s coming from China and unless you spend the international shipping you won&#x27;t get the full refund.</li>
    <li> Good product, non invasive.</li>
    <li> Too big for my small toes (slides around).</li>
    <li> In the case of larger toes they were fine.  With smaller toes, not as good.  They also should probably be slimmer in all cases.</li>
    <li> The loop is pretty comfortable, but moves around easier than I&#x27;d like. I wanted to try them inside my ballet shoes since I have bunions - and they&#x27;re better than the loose gel inserts that you can use, but they still moved too much to dance with (I kept adjusting them during class). The one that stays better is the one with the gel that loops around the big toe and has gel over the joint as well. In both cases I&#x27;m worried about the loop breaking - but thus far they have not shown any signs of breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are convenient, and work - but they aren&#x27;t my favorite option.</li>
    <li> I really like these to keep a specific toe separated. The forth  toe on my right foot is kind of sliding below the third toe and the nail cuts a bit. My toes are also getting crooked as I age and I had hoped this would help but I don&#x27;t think so now. Still a very good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and plan to order again. I have a very very long toe that I broke years ago. This helps so much.</li>
    <li> Not worth it.  It&#x27;s just a piece of foam you can probably make you&#x27;re own.</li>
    <li> I broke my second toe on my left foot way back in High School.  Over the years the toe turned and moved over so my big toe sits on top of the second toe.  As a result I have a lot of problems wear close-toed shoes... lots of pain in the second toe... numbness in my big toe.  I haven&#x27;t used this device every night, but the times I have used it, it has helped eased the pain and numbness.  I will definitely purchase another.</li>
    <li> I had surgery on my foot and have to wear a toe spreader all the time to prevent a bunion. I have tried many which have moved during the day or were too bulky. These are comfortable and never move. I&#x27;ve not had to replace one yet. I bought 4-6 a year ago and rotate using them all.</li>
    <li> I had to purchase these spacers for my little toe and the one next to it.  The spacer did the job of keeping the toes apart but I did find that when I put on socks, the speader did not want to stay in place.  Does anyone out there know how to solve this problem?</li>
    <li> Uncomfortable. I ordered another product that wrapped my toe with cloth and that was much more comfortable. Perhaps a personal preference.</li>
    <li> Bigger spreader/spacer than those from other vendors although hole is about the same size. Depending on type of pain, some might prefer this.  Broke my toe out the first time I wore it, but after washing it well, no more issues.</li>
    <li> This is far too large for any of the toes on my feet.</li>
    <li> I never thought I could walk around with this loop around my toe, but amazingly enough there is no problem.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to help my second toe hammer toe and now an overlapping problem which recently started. ( wants to cross over top of big toe) This is the best I have found so far. Really keeps toes separated,very nicely, helps some keeping hammer toe flatter ( nice wide band fits softly but firmly over middle knuckle of toe) and is extremely comfortable. Really stopping overlap problem and easy to wear all day in all shoes except sandals of course</li>
    <li> This toe separator is too soft.  It does not sit well next to my big toe.  It is really soft.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Holds the second toe down so that shoes fit better. Comfortable to wear.  Not sure how long it will last but does the job.</li>
    <li> Stay on. I have lost so many spreaders and wasted a lot of money!  Thes take a long time to arrive but are worth the wait and cost.  Even stay in place when walking barefooted.   April 28th,2015. I ordered these again and received the same style but a giant size that fell off my toe.  The first ones were so good that I ordered 8 more but they are unwearable.  I asked for smaller ones and they said this is a new batch.  Having trouble communicating and was offered a 5$ refund for almost 16$ worth merchandise.  Sent in pictures to document problem.  Were unwearable so can&#x27;t comment on durability of this &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34; Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> I have only used these a few times. So far, so good. They are easy to put on. They are comfortable to wear. My feet feel better when I use them.</li>
    <li> The toe that is next to the big one is very misaligned. I&#x27;d hoped that these separators would have aided in spreading the toes apart more effectively. They do not. For my condition, they bearly spread them at all. They are nice a pliable, soft and comfortable when you wear them with shoes. I rated them a one because these just aren&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Gel Toe Spreader with Loop and found it was helpful for one hour.  Afterwards it started to hurt that I could not walk for the pain.  This to me is a good try,  but it does not work.  The hammer toe went  right back with it still on.  It is not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
    <li> IT IS TOO SMALL FOR MY TOES , IT REALLY DOES NOT WORK FOR ME&lt;br /&gt;i DO NOT USE IT THET FLIP OVER</li>
    <li> The Gel Toe Spreader relieves the pain in my feet. It stays in place as long as I wear socks. Glad Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in any of the local stores, I did a search on the web and found exactly what I was looking for and the price seemed right.</li>
    <li> If you have crooked toes, hammer toes, or other problems with misaligned toes, these little toe spreaders do a wonderful job of temporarily straightening/protecting your poor toes!  In addition to the soft gel &#x27;loop&#x27; that goes over the toe, there are little &#x27;flanges&#x27; on either side that go under the neighboring toes and help to pull down and straighten the toe (very gently - you barely feel it).  Great price, too...much better then through some catalogs.  And free shipping!</li>
    <li> As a former ballet dancer my feet are pretty messed up...I have bunions on both feet and hammertoes....I can&#x27;t get my chic shoes on because of it....It is very disconcerting to me because I used to wear beautiufl shoes and sandals...I thought this would help, but it is bulky for my dressy shoes and doesn&#x27;t work...I keep searching for something to help me other than surgery which is no guarantee either...And, I have heard horror stories about people that have had the surgery even with the best surgeons...So, where does that leave me?....Anyone know of any doctor in New York City that does anything for this condition without surgery?</li>
    <li> I have arthritis in my fingers and toes and my toes on my left foot were rubbing together so much that it was causing a bump on my 2nd toe and was hurting me a lot. The spreader solves that problem perfectly. Plus it&#x27;s very soft and comfortable. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I have been able to wear this product without the discomfort I have experienced with other items. The softness of the spreader is nice. I purchased the medium as I wear a size 9-1/2 shoe - it is not tight on my toe so doesn&#x27;t pinch or rub. Con is the spreader itself could be a little wider as it compresses due to the softness of the material. (Yeah, I know - I like it because it&#x27;s soft &amp; then complain that it&#x27;s too soft!) NOTE: this item will not give enough separation if worn on the toe next to the Big Toe(Bunion problem). It works best on the smaller toes. I&#x27;ve been careful with this item as I can see the molding seam around the band &amp; now understand the reviews regards breaking apart. Really NOT worth the purchase price!</li>
    <li> For toes of a certain age, this product is helpful to realign the toe and keep it from touching the next one.</li>
    <li> The toe spreader works great, I wish was a bit slimmer to be able to use it in shoes.</li>
    <li> I received a larger toe spreader than what was pictured. It looks like is is intended to sit on the big toe rather than the second toe as shown. I received a form letter when I contacted the seller. They wanted to know what the reason for my problem with their product was (I  had written them why) and they wanted me to mail in two photos with the incorrect product. The mail didn&#x27;t mention to what address. I believe it was sent from Hong Kong. Seems this has cost me way too much time, and no resolution!</li>
    <li> I have used about four other products to help reduce the pain of when I walk.  Nothing works like this one: It&#x27;s soft but still does the trick.  I had received one when I was at the podiatrist.  I had the hardest time finding another one without having to return to the doctor&#x27;s office.  Because of these wonderful things, I can walk without pain, AND I am no longer considering corrective surgery.  Although I have to buy shoes 1/2 size bigger because of this, I do not mind at all.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> These have halted the progression of my bunions.  They are more comfortable to wear than most splints, and easy to put on.  Just wash them in warm water and soap.  I will continue to use these and hopefully avoid surgery down the line.</li>
    <li> Have had 2 of these since May 2013 and they do the job.  Have tried at least 6 other similar items listed here, with poor results.  I keep one in my travel bag and use the other daily.  Easy to wash and air dry overnight.  I hike at least weekly in the mountains, usually 5 miles minimum.  Much more comfortable with this.  They fit well within all my existing shoes, and show no signs of failure so far, with daily wear for nearly a year and a half.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item hoping, but doubting it would be helpful for the foot pain I had due to a bunion.  In fact, it has helped a lot.  It is soft and comfortable to wear.  I can now wear shoes I have avoided wearing due to foot pain.  The toe loop is helpful in keeping the toe spreader in place.  I wear it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product again in March 2013 and found it to be poorly made.  This time the loop that holds the spacer in place broke the first time I wore it.  The original item I bought a few months ago was worth 5 stars.  The current product is pretty useless. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I am an above knee amputee, so my \\&quot;sound\\&quot; foot bears more weight than it would if I had both legs.  My hammer toe had become so painful that I was having trouble getting around.  That situation is much improved since I started wearing the toe spreader.</li>
    <li> I have suffered all my life with feet problems and after bunion surgery it made a new problem for me that I have found no relief for until now.  I did not want another surgery to fix what was created by the last one, so I tried this and it has given me great comfort.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT ONLY LASTED TWO DAYS UNTIL IT SPLIT AND IS USELESS.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT IDEA BUT DEFECTIVE. IF HAD NOT SPLIT. WOULD RATE FIVE STARS.</li>
    <li> Got my spreaders today. I put them inmediately. I hardly notice them, but I can feel something in my food is moving to the right position.&lt;br /&gt;I walked on them on the treatmill and keep them all day long. No problem at all. I am very happy that I can start correcting my hammer toe. I used the two of them in the same foot, as I only have one hammer toe. So I place one over the hammer toe with wide gel are facing the big toe. The other one in the toe next to the hammer toe, with the wide  gel are facing the hammer toe. That made a nice cushioned splint that corrects my hammer to and is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product, it is exactly what I have been looking for and I have tried a lot of products.</li>
    <li> This gel toe spreader with loop seemed like it should work but when I worn it shopping and was up on my feet for a couple of hours, I was really hurting by the time I got to my car.  I had to pull it off before I could drive home from shopping.  So, bottom line, if you try it, do it around the house and not for hours!</li>
    <li> horrible, waste of money</li>
    <li> I love this toe separater--keeps in it&#x27;s place all the time.  Highly suggested for those with bunions.  Wonderful product to use.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these and they all ripped on the seam the first day!&lt;br /&gt;I have used another brand and they were great!</li>
    <li> The first time I wore them the loop ripped and now they are useless.  The loop is very thin and easily torn.</li>
    <li> My parents are using this product and they love it so much.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve had bunion issues for a while and this summer I developed a hammer toe...next to my big toe.&lt;br /&gt;This causes lots of pain on the ball of my foot.  With this product,  I put the loop on my 2nd toe and the gel protects that toe and keeps my big toe from crowding the 2nd toe.  Ball of foot pain is significantly reduced.  I am glad I tried this and just ordered  several more.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing these during the day to regulate my big toes and prevent my bunions from getting worse.  The gel toe spreaders are soft and fits well with most of my shoes.  If you are looking for a cure, these are not for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my 2nd toe was overlapping my big toe.  I wore this once and the loop broke. This product was totally useless for me.</li>
