### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great for peels</li>
      <li>Good price good product!</li>
      <li>brushes are good quality and price is awsome great purchase work well with the acid peel I also purchased.  </li>
      <li>good to put chemical on</li>
      <li>this wpuld be good to use to apply it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t apply good</li>
      <li>This product was okay</li>
      <li>I am sure the one works</li>
      <li>I found  using cotton pads works  a lot easier and worked better</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and wash.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t use your bare hands to apply an acid peel; this brush does the job very nicely.</li>
      <li>I was lightly going over my cheecks and the corner of the metal part</li>
      <li>I didnt expect a fabulous brush</li>
      <li>A very useful brush that I already have seen to be used by professionals and was looking fo for quite a while.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe the gauze pads soak in too much of the peel and puts on more than is needed</li>
      <li>This brush helps apply the acid peeling gel quickly and uniformly all over the face and neck.</li>
      <li>Does the job right.</li>
      <li>I finally gave up and reached for a cotton ball which worked much better.</li>
      <li>, this was my first buy</li>
      <li>The brush part works just fine, I just have to make sure not to get the metal part close to my face as it has a little piece of metal that sticks out and scratches my face.</li>
      <li>I contacted the company and I received a new one right away</li>
      <li>For some reason they made the metal part that holds the bristles very pointy on the corners.</li>
      <li>but... I notice that with the brush... I&#x27;m not hurting quite as much as when applied with the gauze pads.  </li>
      <li>It was a reasonable price, so I think to get more of this but narrow.</li>
      <li>for my small face, It would be wise if I ordered a smaller fan brush.</li>
      <li>flimsy and cheap certainly not what I expected I had had this brush sent to me free when ordering skincare facial kits from skincare company&#x27;s..</li>
      <li>I just try to keep that part from getting near.</li>

    <li> good to put chemical on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the gauze pads and the brush applicator.  I don&#x27;t know if maybe the gauze pads soak in too much of the peel and puts on more than is needed but... I notice that with the brush... I&#x27;m not hurting quite as much as when applied with the gauze pads.  So I think that the brush helps to put on just what you need.</li>
    <li> This product was okay it spread when it was wet. Overall I guess not to bad for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how the stick pokes through the brush with any pressure.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and wash. It holds acid gel well. The brush hair stays well after each wash.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a jessner&#x27;s peel kitanffigured this wpuld be good to use to apply it. But i was so disappointed with it. For starters, it fell apart on me while i was applying my chemical peel. Secondly, the bristles clumpe together instead remaining fanned out so i ened up with a streaky application. I finally gave up and reached for a cotton ball which worked much better. I didnt expect a fabulous brush but i certainly expected it to hold up to through at least a few uses.</li>
    <li> flimsy and cheap certainly not what I expected I had had this brush sent to me free when ordering skincare facial kits from skincare company&#x27;s..</li>
    <li> This brush helps apply the acid peeling gel quickly and uniformly all over the face and neck. You can&#x27;t use your bare hands to apply an acid peel; this brush does the job very nicely.</li>

    <li> Does the job right. Sometimes I wish the was a bit small, because I think it&#x27;s too large, but I recomend.</li>
    <li> A very useful brush that I already have seen to be used by professionals and was looking fo for quite a while. I used it to application of masks and also acids for peeling. It seems to be resistent. It was a reasonable price, so I think to get more of this but narrow.</li>
    <li> this did nothing to help with application of acid. if anything, clumped and splashed while using the acid. felt like a mess with this</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased this because even the directions for something like a tca peel just suggest using a cotton ball. This is a waste of money. Hopefully I can find some other use for it</li>
    <li> I found  using cotton pads works  a lot easier and worked better I wouldn&amp;#34;t recommend  this product  to any of my friends</li>
    <li> The picture shows 3 brushes. I only got one brush and that was expensive with the shipping and handling. I am sure the one works ok. Have not used it yet.</li>
    <li> Be very careful when using this fan brush. For some reason they made the metal part that holds the bristles very pointy on the corners. I was lightly going over my cheecks and the corner of the metal part scratched my cheeck about 2 inches across. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> The amount paid for this brush is wayyyyyy overpriced.. if you can find somethine cheaper i would go for that&lt;br /&gt;Quality- similar to a 2 $ a Micheals or something.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Does not stay like a open like in the pricture, once dipped into the Acid Peel it begins to bunch together&lt;br /&gt;Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t apply good and I can tell it won&#x27;t last me long. It sells for a decent price though but maybe alittle too expensive</li>
    <li> The one I ordered wasnt even glued together (the brush to the handle). I contacted the company and I received a new one right away and it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> I use this to apply my glycolic for a weekly peel. The brush cleans up beatifully and stands up to the harsh chemicals week after week.</li>
    <li> brushes are good quality and price is awsome great purchase work well with the acid peel I also purchased.  Good price good product!</li>
    <li> Great for peels and I would get different sizes, this was my first buy and it works well but the fan is too big  for my small face, It would be wise if I ordered a smaller fan brush.</li>
