### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so my hair may not be the best judge</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also used on a warm humid day everyone&#x27;s hair was frizzy except mine!!!  </li>
      <li>I never write reviews but this is AMAZING!!  </li>
      <li>Try it hopefully your  results  will be great like mine.</li>
      <li>SMOOTH AS SILK,  I received a sample pack of this product and was so impressed with the silky shiny hair I got from this product.</li>
      <li>Anyway I love it!</li>
      <li>I Love this product!</li>
      <li>really makes me happy</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it has a bit more volume, though.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sure it&#x27;s great the first day you use it, but any hair would be silky smooth after straightening it the way the directions say to.  </li>
      <li>I think it worked pretty good.  </li>
      <li>My daughters love this product, it really works.!!!  </li>
      <li>I am loving it very much.</li>
      <li>Product made my hair super greasy!</li>
      <li>keeps my hair nice and straight</li>
      <li>Love it use it often and well worth the price.</li>
      <li>great treatment for a short time</li>
      <li>This item is available on U L T A for $6.99 a bottle.</li>
      <li>Used it the first time and received many compliments on how shinny my hair was.  </li>
      <li>I use this in edition to adding some Paul Mitchells super skinny serum</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this for people who have fine hair -- it will most definitely weigh your hair</li>
      <li>An absolute beauty must!</li>
      <li>After trying vertually everything on the market, this is the only product that keeps my hair looking frizz free for 4-6 days even after washing.</li>
      <li>think you need to buy into the whole set --</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was given the entire system (shampoo, conditioner, heat treatment) free during Fashion Week and had to see if it was just hype or for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used the amount directed and it felt as though I had too much product in my hair.</li>
      <li>the treatment is really ineffective and doesn&#x27;t do much, even with the help of heat styling.</li>
      <li>I found this at my shoprite on sale for $3.40 so after 1 day and loving the results I went back and bought whet was left on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>, I noticed a significant amount of flyaways appeared, a problem I did not have prior to using this product,whether I blow or air-day my hair.</li>
      <li>Directions say dry completely, then flat iron and good to go.  </li>
      <li>right before I&#x27;m ready to flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Admittedly even professional Brazillian Blowouts and Keratin Treatments don&#x27;t work very well on my hair</li>
      <li>I had no trouble drying my hair.  </li>
      <li>I find using this product makes my hair so much easier to flat iron.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The time to use the product is too long without much results.  </li>
      <li>Luckily i had a silicone-based serum with me to tame the halo of frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the shampoo and conditioner are ordinary formulas that are gentle and mild -- not really different from other shampoo/cond</li>

<li> Hard to dry my hair with this goopy mess.</li>
<li> A little goopy but works well.</li>

<li> I have extremely thick frizzy curly ethnic hair.  </li>
<li> Not good - does not work.&lt;br</li>
<li> So charging $25.97 seems a little outrageous.</li>
<li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
<li> won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
<li> ALL THIS STUFF DOES IS MAKE MY HAIR GREASY, IT SUCKS, DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;It really makes me happy everytime I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it has a bit more volume, though.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this is AMAZING!!  Used it the first time and received many compliments on how shinny my hair was.  Also used on a warm humid day everyone&#x27;s hair was frizzy except mine!!!  I found this at my shoprite on sale for $3.40 so after 1 day and loving the results I went back and bought whet was left on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
    <li> Product made my hair super greasy!</li>
    <li> After using it the waves and frizz in my hair were still there. It may have smoothed it out slightly but not very much. Admittedly even professional Brazillian Blowouts and Keratin Treatments don&#x27;t work very well on my hair so my hair may not be the best judge but that was my experience.</li>
    <li> I think it worked pretty good.  My hair is thin and frizzy but this product makes it look smooth and silky.  It does not last for 7 days but it does work well.</li>
    <li> I received it yesterday and immediately tried it. My hair is wavy, curly and frizzy, so of course I have a pixie haircut. My routine is blow dry, flatiron, repeat the next morning. I was cautiously hopeful. I followed the directions which were very simple, wash, blow dry and flatiron 3x. This morning it looked just like last night. I am loving it very much. I recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff did not work at all.  Sure it&#x27;s great the first day you use it, but any hair would be silky smooth after straightening it the way the directions say to.  After one wash with non sulfate shampoo it&#x27;s now even frizzier than before I used it!!!  Ruined my hair.  Going in the trash.</li>
    <li> SMOOTH AS SILK,  I received a sample pack of this product and was so impressed with the silky shiny hair I got from this product. I had no trouble drying my hair.  Directions say dry completely, then flat iron and good to go.  After I dried and just barely ironed it finished  with a dab of argon oil.  I like this product because it does not weigh your hair down.  Get silky hair that has lots of body.  I am ordering this hair routine from Amazon, am very surprised at the negative reviews.  I have blonde hair, colored and highlighted, no problem with color.  Try it hopefully your  results  will be great like mine.</li>
    <li> great treatment for a short time</li>
    <li> A little goopy but works well. Hard to dry my hair with this goopy mess.</li>
    <li> I am surprised that this product has so many bad reviews. I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been getting my hair chemically straightened 3 times a year since I was 12, (now 23). I have extremely thick frizzy curly ethnic hair.  I find using this product makes my hair so much easier to flat iron. It comes out straighter then when I have used other products and definitely less frizzy. I use this in edition to adding some Paul Mitchells super skinny serum right before I&#x27;m ready to flat iron.  I now use the entire line.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it depends on what hair type you have?  Anyway I love it!</li>
    <li> My daughters love this product, it really works.!!!  It keeps their hair like they just step out of the salon.</li>
    <li> I have thin frizzy hair in a very humid climate. After trying vertually everything on the market, this is the only product that keeps my hair looking frizz free for 4-6 days even after washing. An absolute beauty must!</li>
    <li> Not good - does not work.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is coarse and wavy to curly - east indian hair.  In humid weather, it turns to being frizzy, hence I hoped I found some help with taming the frizz.  This product did not work on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time to use the product is too long without much results.  It&#x27;s the same results as if I blow-dried my hair and felt ironed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I Love this product! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I put this thru the ULTIMATE 7-day test: the high-heat, humid climate of Southeast Asia. Guess what? this watery lotion had no effect on my hair&#x27;s frizz -- no visible reduction at all. Luckily i had a silicone-based serum with me to tame the halo of frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the entire system (shampoo, conditioner, heat treatment) free during Fashion Week and had to see if it was just hype or for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think you need to buy into the whole set -- the shampoo and conditioner are ordinary formulas that are gentle and mild -- not really different from other shampoo/cond formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the treatment is really ineffective and doesn&#x27;t do much, even with the help of heat styling.</li>
    <li> This item is available on U L T A for $6.99 a bottle. Given that this is a two bottle pack, the price should be $14.00 or so. So charging $25.97 seems a little outrageous.</li>
    <li> keeps my hair nice and straight</li>
    <li> I have thick, slightly wavy hair, and this was my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The product worked only the day of application. For me, it does not last 7 days or through 3 washes like the label claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Once applied, my hair felt heavier and weighed down. I used the amount directed and it felt as though I had too much product in my hair. I would not recommend this for people who have fine hair -- it will most definitely weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-As the week went on and I washed my hair daily, I noticed a significant amount of flyaways appeared, a problem I did not have prior to using this product,whether I blow or air-day my hair.</li>
    <li> ALL THIS STUFF DOES IS MAKE MY HAIR GREASY, IT SUCKS, DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Love it use it often and well worth the price.</li>
