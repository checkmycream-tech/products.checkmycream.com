### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am a happy customer!</li>
      <li>I love this product, i ve been using it for over a year, somebody gave it to me as a gift , and now i am buying it again from amazon!</li>
      <li>It is great and easy to use .</li>
      <li>I use it before i put mascara on and it gives my lashes amazing volume and lifts them up nicely with out using any kind of curler.</li>
      <li>Works fantastic!</li>
      <li>It seems that this product does offer more dense lashes, but I can&#x27;t vouch for the lenght (just yet).</li>
      <li>I am looking forward to them growing our some more.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try this since It seemed to have pretty good reviews</li>
      <li>Cheap as it is do not buy it.</li>
      <li>I looove this thing, works and is cheap</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are starting to look fuller and now has nice curl on them..</li>
      <li>Considering, that it&#x27;s delivered fro Europe, very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>The first week I used it I did see a difference.</li>
      <li>First off it came 5 days AFTER estimated date of delivery.</li>
      <li>As unusual as it is, I have found this product to be exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>At first I was very skeptic to purchase this, but it is quite inexpensive</li>
      <li>The creamy coating disappears on the lash, does not get in my eyes, and my eyelashes are really longer and fuller.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
      <li>Just a primer for lashes really.</li>
      <li>whats really in it</li>
      <li>before I&#x27;ve had straight eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Think it would work really well if I could remember to do it every day like I should.</li>
      <li>however I was hoping to at least have a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>Positive progress so far...</li>
      <li>Highly suggest this product.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t have any high expectations as far as it growing my lashes</li>
      <li>It also helps to wear this product with out mascara on your lashes, however, it is white and is very visible on your lashes, i usually do that when i am at home all day :) really do recommend this, and will buy it again and again!</li>
      <li>and I can see new baby lashes coming out.  </li>
      <li>research research research before you buy anything thats going near your eyes!</li>
      <li>As far as growth, i can&#x27;t speak for it 100% , but i do see how , my lashes are fuller and look healthier.  </li>
      <li>My lashes look longer and the serum is the perfect base just applying before mascara.  </li>
      <li>It made my lashes stiff and I actually lost more eyelashes while I was using it, not to mention that white tint it leaves on your lashes.</li>
      <li>It really defines every single lash.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone especially if they have sensitive eyes because it irritated my eyes.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s not a long term fix.  </li>

<li> this is the only stuff that actually works, doesn&#x27;t burn or harm the eyes and never caused a stye, like the other stuff I used did.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s the product on market, never seeing my lashes so long.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for growing your lashes on a long term basis.</li>
<li> I have very long eye lashes</li>
<li> Needless to say I will NOT be putting that mystery serum anywhere near my eyes!!!!</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t work, at least it works well enough as a primer&amp;#34;.  </li>

<li> I did notice a little bit of growth as well.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> I checked the mail box everyday waiting for it</li>
<li> one of not many lash conditioners that didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, however I didn&#x27;t see any difference in their growth</li>
<li> it appeared to have dried up inside the tube!</li>
<li> With that said this product sucks.</li>
<li> seems to help my eyelashes just after a few days!!</li>
<li> and I bought this on the ridiculous hope that I could reduce my mascara usage.  </li>
<li> I use once a day and my eyelashes appear to be longer but dramatic amount longer.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I must say that I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  </li>
<li> Id feel horrible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this product a month or so ago and it works well. I use once a day and my eyelashes appear to be longer but dramatic amount longer.</li>
    <li> Cheap as it is do not buy it. I couldn&#x27;t even get the white sticky stuff out of the tube and onto the wand. it appeared to have dried up inside the tube!</li>
    <li> As unusual as it is, I have found this product to be exactly as advertised. The creamy coating disappears on the lash, does not get in my eyes, and my eyelashes are really longer and fuller. I have even tried it on my eybrows to some benefit.</li>
    <li> First off it came 5 days AFTER estimated date of delivery. When it did get here The packed is written only in either dutch or french. Needless to say I will NOT be putting that mystery serum anywhere near my eyes!!!! I checked the mail box everyday waiting for it and it finally came and I cant put my vision at risk! I  wish I wouldnt have even bought it. I cant girt it either I have no idea whats really in it and if I gave it to someone and they were injured do to it Id feel horrible! research research research before you buy anything thats going near your eyes!</li>
    <li> My lashes look longer and the serum is the perfect base just applying before mascara.  Highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
    <li> It is great and easy to use . It is my favourite treatment to my eyelash .&lt;br /&gt;Also i like all eveline costumes.&lt;br /&gt;Om abdulaziz</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and I&#x27;ve already starting to see some changes. My eyelashes are starting to look fuller and now has nice curl on them.. before I&#x27;ve had straight eyelashes. I did notice a little bit of growth as well. My eyes never stings or burns when I use it. Positive progress so far...so I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I looove this thing, works and is cheap</li>
    <li> one of not many lash conditioners that didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, however I didn&#x27;t see any difference in their growth</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this since It seemed to have pretty good reviews and I&#x27;m in need of an eyelash serum. I really didn&#x27;t have any high expectations as far as it growing my lashes however I was hoping to at least have a good conditioner. With that said this product sucks. It made my lashes stiff and I actually lost more eyelashes while I was using it, not to mention that white tint it leaves on your lashes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone especially if they have sensitive eyes because it irritated my eyes. In the end I threw it out. What a waist.</li>
    <li> I think it has helped to some extent with growth.  I like using it with mascara because it helps with smoothless and less clumping.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time. I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> this is the only stuff that actually works, doesn&#x27;t burn or harm the eyes and never caused a stye, like the other stuff I used did.  I am going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! Goes great as a base before  you  apply your mascara</li>
    <li> I have very long eye lashes and I bought this on the ridiculous hope that I could reduce my mascara usage.  Unfortunately, I must say that I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  I will say that when applied under mascara, it does help in lengthening.  However, it&#x27;s not a long term fix.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for growing your lashes on a long term basis.</li>
    <li> The formula works, but it is opaque whitish in color and has to be removed in the morning or it clumps.</li>
    <li> Think it would work really well if I could remember to do it every day like I should. The first week I used it I did see a difference. Think my sister would like it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, i ve been using it for over a year, somebody gave it to me as a gift , and now i am buying it again from amazon! I use it before i put mascara on and it gives my lashes amazing volume and lifts them up nicely with out using any kind of curler. It really defines every single lash. As far as growth, i can&#x27;t speak for it 100% , but i do see how , my lashes are fuller and look healthier.  i use Eveline with CityLash at the same time, but i used Eveline longer than i have both together. It also helps to wear this product with out mascara on your lashes, however, it is white and is very visible on your lashes, i usually do that when i am at home all day :) really do recommend this, and will buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> Ordered it second time. It&#x27;s the product on market, never seeing my lashes so long. Considering, that it&#x27;s delivered fro Europe, very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> seems to help my eyelashes just after a few days!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> At first I was very skeptic to purchase this, but it is quite inexpensive so I gave it a try.  I have been using this for a couple of week now and I can see new baby lashes coming out.  Initially I only applied it when I went to bed, but I started using it as a primer for my mascara since I thought &amp;#34;if it doesn&#x27;t work, at least it works well enough as a primer&amp;#34;.  So a couple of days ago I started noticing my baby lashes!  I am looking forward to them growing our some more.  It seems that this product does offer more dense lashes, but I can&#x27;t vouch for the lenght (just yet).</li>
    <li> Not good but not bad either. Just a primer for lashes really.</li>
