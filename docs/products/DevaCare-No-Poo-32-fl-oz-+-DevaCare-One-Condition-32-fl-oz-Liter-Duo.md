      <li>The One Conditioner gets rid of  knots smoothly just by combing thru with my fingers.</li>
      <li>Thanks Deve Care!!!</li>
      <li>And even with all the equipment, the hot tools, all the anti-frizz glop in the world, it still looked like heck most of the time.</li>
      <li>this is Deva Care not Deva Curl and is not close to the original product.</li>
      <li>For the first time I&#x27;m able to use a conditioner and gel on my curls without having to use tons of hairspray to control my frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a slight mentholness to the no-poo that feels great on your scalp, and the conditioner is very rich and creamy.  </li>
      <li>When I purchased I did not read the full name</li>
      <li>Really, it was a blessing in disguise, because switching to this product has given me the softest, healthiest, shiniest hair that has ever been on my head :)  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well to hold color longer. It takes some getting use to - not having foaming, soapy shampoo, but if you can handle that, this is super gentle on your hair and my fine hair is never weighed down by it. The only thing this is missing, is that I don&#x27;t feel like it does anything for scalp health. I think it might be worthwhile to use something else a few days a week for that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was told it was more moisterizing than the regular combo of the DevaCurl line.  I wish I could get my money back because my hair hates this stuff but loves the one with the green label.  Now I&#x27;m forced to use it up because it&#x27;s so expensive :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick with the cheaper (but effective) SheaMoisture line of products which tend to fit my budget and if I find one of those products don&#x27;t work I don&#x27;t feel so bad since I didn&#x27;t pay a lot of $$$$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, stay away from this product if you hair needs LOTS of moisture like mine.  I have naturally curly African American hair and find this line to be drying for my curls.</li>
    <li> It is horrible, didn&#x27;t do anything, my hair felt like never washed greasy after use. don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> The only issue I have had is the lids.  It is very hard to get the product out of the bottle.  Needs to have a pump.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my curls. I use a little of the conditioner as a styling cream when my curls need a little moisture.</li>
    <li> I love Deva! Rich, moisturizing, tames my chaos!</li>
    <li> These products are a life changer. I don&#x27;t need to spend money on any other products again. They last a really long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Deva addict and have switched even my daughter over to this as it&#x27;s been very &#x27;repairing&#x27; to our hair.  Love that I can get these in large bottles and re-fill my smaller ones and travel ones.  Love the smell of DevaCare.  Love mixing the conditioner with water in a spray bottle and reviving my curls throughout the day - constant conditioning!</li>
    <li> Best thing ever for long curly hair!  Every time I try to use something else, I end up coming right back to it.</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair is so soft and never frizzy. Each time I see the results with regular sudsing shampoo I&#x27;m more and more impressed with this product. I have fine naturally curly hair, its color treated and I get a brazilian blow out- I though this product would be ineffective against my oily scalp, but I&#x27;ve found that my scalp doesn&#x27;t get oily anymore. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Makes the perfect curl!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m changing my review.  I had given this just an ok.  Then I went to a hair stylist who specializes in curly hair and was schooled in the art of using these products (as well as the gels) to get my hair to curl and look gorgeous.  You really do have to know how to use these.  I prefer the smell over DevaCare and this is what I need anyway since my hair is color-treated.</li>
    <li> It is not the real product. My wife typically buys this product at the hair salon, at hair salon prices. She thought: &amp;#34;it would be great to save a little money not having to pay full retail&amp;#34;. She knew the first time she used it, this wan&#x27;t the same product she was used to. You get what you pay for, this is a knock-off. It&#x27;s okay as far as regular shampoo and conditioner goes, but it is clearly not the high quality product had salons sell. And it&#x27;s a lot more expensive than supermarket products, which this clearly is.</li>
    <li> Love how creamy DevaCare products are! The DevaCare cleanser and conditioner are so creamy however that I can&#x27;t dispense the product via the white caps. I always have to unscrew the cap to squeeze out product. This product also has a stronger scent than the DevaCurl products which is a nice fruity scent. My hair color didn&#x27;t fade as bad with the DevaCare vs DevaCurl product.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo for people with curly hair. Although it&#x27;s a tad expensive, it leaves my hair soft and silky after each wash</li>
    <li> great curly hair product -- some of the best</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have ever used, and I don&#x27;t have curly hair.  I just have fine hair that tangles easily.  It leaves my hair so soft and shiny even with all of the abuse I put  it through, coloring, blow drying, and curling irons.  You cannot go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE NATURALLY CURLY OR WAVY HAIR, the DevaCurl product line will revolutionize your hair-grooming life. Click on my name and look at my picture: my (then dyed black) hair has been flat-ironed and hairsprayed within an inch of its life in that shot, taken on a cold &amp; damp December day in NY City (if you look you can see it&#x27;s just fixin&#x27; to bust out into a massive wall of frizz). And even with all the equipment, the hot tools, all the anti-frizz glop in the world, it still looked like heck most of the time. Truth be told, even when it looked *good* it was really just ok; I mean, my hair wasn&#x27;t ever anything special, styled straight. Still, for years I tried to cultivate a sleek curtain of Jennifer Aniston-style locks, swimming upstream, fighting nature, when it wasn&#x27;t ever realistically in the cards for me for the simple reason that, duh! *straight hair* isn&#x27;t in my DNA. Took me long enough to figure it out. I&#x27;m a CurlyGirl. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENTER DEVACURL. So, I&#x27;ve been using these two products for a couple months. I scarcely do anything else with my hair at all. I air-dry with a few clips in the crown (see the CurlyGirl Handbook for more on this trick); I don&#x27;t even use a diffuser. And I&#x27;ve got soft, fat spiral curls florishing, radiating out, spilling out and down my back and--whoa--all over!! I never *knew* I had such curl-power; it looks like I have the hair of the goddesses! I have frizz-free, GORGEOUS mermaid hair ALL the time, and I&#x27;m truly not kidding. My hair is beautiful for the first time in my adult life, because finally, now, at long last, I&#x27;ve discovered what my *kind* of hair needs to look its best. Would I recommend these products to you? If you have NATURALLY CURLY/WAVY HAIR, yes, I do, with all my heart. Except for one thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PRICE of these basic DevaCurl products KEEPS GOING UP AND UP, and it won&#x27;t be long before I CAN&#x27;T AFFORD IT anymore. I don&#x27;t know why this is happening, or who&#x27;s responsible (there are folks with theories all over the net), but whatever: For me, the plain fact of the matter is that one more price increase, and I&#x27;ll be foreced to start looking for some cheaper, inferior alternative, and that will really, really suck, because I&#x27;m crazy about this stuff, and I soooooo wanted it to be my hair care HG...forever.l over the net), but whatever: For me, the plain fact of the matter is that one more price increase, and I&#x27;ll be foreced to start looking for some cheaper, inferior alternative, and that will really, really suck, because I&#x27;m crazy about this stuff, and I soooooo wanted it to be my hair care HG...forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just now reading the reviews (after I purchased and used the product.) I have heard so many amazing things about DevaCurl so I decided to give it a try.  I read an article about drugstore products and products online not being the &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; product because they often times add alcohol to the product to dilute it.  I used this product and ever since, I have a spot on the back of my head that is severely dry and I cannot get it to go away.  I am very disappointed. I see a lot of other customers had product missing and faithful DevaCurl customers do not believe it is the same after they have used it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for several months.  It made my scalp itch and it is really difficult to remove tangles.  It is very time consuming compared to regular conditioner.  As far as styling my hair.  it does keep moisture in so your curls look nicer.  I like the idea of this product, but it needs improvement.</li>
    <li> The product came in a timely fashion and was packed properly.  I love this product for healthy curly hair - would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Use this all the time for years.  Best product (much better than Wen) for dry wavy or curly hair.  Plus it protects from sun damage.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, works great for curly hair that is colored too.  Scent could be better, but I can live without that.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product brand out there! Worth every penny. I have curly hair and leaves it soft and curly at the same time.</li>
    <li> Been using for years! Puts Wen products to shame!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving a fairly poor review because compared to the new line of products by DEVA CURL, these products don&#x27;t smell as nice, or work as well.</li>
    <li> Product came well wrapped. Took me a while to get used to no suds, but now love it. Makes my curly hair feel soft &amp; frizz free.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this on her natural and colored hair. Gives her curls more definition. Nice product. Product arrived with what appeared to be some  product missing. I didn&#x27;t pursue sending it back, too much hassle for a few ounces missing. Will be careful next time.</li>
    <li> If you have thoroughly stripped your hair of residue from using traditional shampoos you simply cannot go wrong with this duo.  If you have been using a traditional type of shampoo (foam with sulfides) all this shampoo is going to do is gum up your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with the Deva no poo, not Deva CARE no poo.  The Deva no poo will still gum up your hair the first few washings; ie set aside time to wash your hair a good 3 - 5 times the first time using the no poo.  Also be prepared to think you have ruined your hair and for the ammonia smell of the sulfides rinsing out, but rest assured you are on your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a full 32 oz bottle of the regular Deva no poo before switching to the Care then use the regular no poo once a week to cut any additional styling product residue.  In retrospect it would have been fine to use the Care conditioner from the start, but the conditioner is really a personal choice.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for over a year now. My hair has never been this healthy. I will never use another brand again! I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and this product has changed the texture and frizz completely!</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with this product.  My daughter got me a sample from Nordstroms and that was it.  My hair looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner by accident.  I didn&#x27;t understand that DevaCare is for color treated hair, and I meant to buy the regular DevaCurl products with the green label.  However, the products both work just fine for my dry, curly hair.  I don&#x27;t find them to be too heavy or anything like that.  My only complaint about these products is their smell.  They smell like a rotten creamsicle.  Then again, I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant, I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.  I love the way the regular DevaCurl products smell, so I&#x27;m disappointed that these are so different.  On the positive side, the shampoo smell doesn&#x27;t linger, especially after I put product in my hair.  Smell aside, I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> My answer to my hair prayer!!! a must try .. along with the Mist-er Right , and Deva Curl Ultra Defining Gel formerly Deva Care Arc Angel</li>
    <li> Diva Curl products keep the moisture in my daughter&#x27;s curls so that her hair stays curly and not frizzy. This is the only brand she will use and Amazon consistently has the best price on it when shipped with Prime.</li>
    <li> LOVE.  These products leave your hair feeling soft and manageable, but also totally clean.  There&#x27;s a slight mentholness to the no-poo that feels great on your scalp, and the conditioner is very rich and creamy.  I converted to these products over two years ago, and I&#x27;ve never looked back-- they&#x27;re an absolute godsend for my coarse, frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give samples to my friends and family all the time, and I&#x27;ve converted almost all of them.  This is a SUPER deal to test the products and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND they don&#x27;t test on animals.  Yay!</li>
    <li> This came quickly! It was great. I am not a huge fan of the smell of the conditioner (personally, others might!). I may use the regular Deva Curl conditioner next time. however the product works really well. I have really curly hair and have such a hard time finding a conditioner that hydrates well and will detangle-- this works!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner for curly hair. Every now and then I try different brands, but I always come back to Diva products to fix what the other products did.</li>
    <li> Color was off and did not smell as good as Deva Curl from the salon.  Works well, but the color and smell put me off a bit.</li>
    <li> I have med length curly hair, and I can not live without my DevaCare, NOTHING has ever worked like this to keep my hair curly, but nice and smooth curls at the same time.  No more frizz and frazz, of course I use the mouse and cream and sometimes the spray gel for days that I just want to touch up a bit.  At night I put all the curls in a pony tail holder on top of my head and just let them fall again in the morning.  This really is an amazing product.  Thanks Deve Care!!!</li>
    <li> Really like this combo. Hair is soft, and experience less fall-out that using store brand conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love these products they help my hair.</li>
    <li> From the first time I used it I was incredibly impressed how my 3a/b hair responded.  Unlike products like Wen and some of the coconut oil based products, my hair also actually felt clean when I used it.  But the smell? Really bad.  Like rotten creamsickles.  Really, it is a total downer in the shower to have to smell it.  Good thing is most of us use some other product afterwards, so you don&#x27;t leave the shower smelling horrible.</li>
    <li> I have been using Deva Curl for years. This is a first time I decided to buy it from Amazon. What I got does not look or smell like the DevaCurl products I&#x27;m used to. Both shampoo and the conditioner are pinkish color (it&#x27;s supposed to be white!..) and the smell is not the smell I&#x27;m used to. Not sure what this is. My hair also feels quite dry and dull, and believe me I do know how to use these products... Returning the whole thing including the gel.</li>
    <li> I have been trying quite a few different SLS free shampoos and Silicone free conditioners over the past few months and nothing even came close to these.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo cleanses really well and and straight away I feel my hair is being pampered.The One Conditioner gets rid of  knots smoothly just by combing thru with my fingers.They travel a long way to get to me but is so worth the extra time and money needed.They are long lasting too and I have not even used a quarter of these bottles and I have used them for over a month now.Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was expecting the white bottle with the green label.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Leaves my hair soft, less frizz, richer color, and color stays in longer. The fragrance is very yummy too! I recommitted to anyone that likes Wen. It&#x27;s cheaper and just as good.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I have tried so many different products over the years. Yet, I always find myself coming back to DevaCurl. The shampoo is sulfate free so that takes a little getting used to (or at least for me it did). But I love that after a few weeks of use, I am able to use little to no anti-frizz product. My hair always looks and feels healthy, and the product is concentrated so these bottles last a long time (and that&#x27;s with an almost daily wash).</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this shampoo and conditioner because I had heard and read nothing but good things about it. However, I was left disappointed. My hair was dull and dry. I wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell either. I have naturally curly hair that is overly processed and this product did absolutely nothing for me. :( waste of money.</li>
    <li> Both my daughters use and love the Deva Care products. One has super-curly coarse hair and the other wavy fine hair but these products suit them both. I&#x27;ve never seen them stick with a shampoo and conditioner set longer. I even use it on occasion and my hair is short and baby fine. It is hard to get used to no suds with a shampoo but it really does work well.</li>
    <li> A curly hair must have.  While suitable for any curly hair, the Deva Care line, as Deva Curl, is recommended for color treated hair, though I&#x27;ve used both with excellent results.</li>
    <li> The absolute best no poo shampoo for naturally curly hair that is color treated!! Pair with the Ultra Defining Gel for all day curl with no frizz</li>
    <li> I love how much softer my hair is with this product, which doesn&#x27;t contain sulphates and dry my hair like regular foaming shampoos. I also find less hair comes out when I wash it with Deva Care No-poo.  This was a good price for the product, which is much more expensive in stores and even most places on the internet.</li>
    <li> Hair feels great. Perfect for my curls. keeps the color and moisture in my hair. Cant go back to regular shampoo as it strips the hair and causes further damage.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> So disappointed. When I purchased I did not read the full name this is Deva Care not Deva Curl and is not close to the original product. This is cleanser is thick and heavy and did not make my hair feel as soft as the Deva Curl. Will be more careful next time.</li>
    <li> I was pretty upset when I discovered that I was getting hosed on price for my Wen order (they charged WAY more than they said they would), because not only did I lose money, but I thought I had to stop using the best hair product line I had ever had.  Really, it was a blessing in disguise, because switching to this product has given me the softest, healthiest, shiniest hair that has ever been on my head :)  When visiting home this past week, I let my mother try it one time, and she immediately went to the store and bought herself the products.  Make sure when you are using it to focus on the scalp with the shampoo, and the conditioner will be used on the rest.  I am a runner, so I have to wash my hair daily since I get pretty sweaty, but when I get days off, I can&#x27;t believe how freshly washed my hair looks even after over 24 hours of not washing it (my hair used to get very greasy, very fast).  Great product for any hair type!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price. Had I bought this in store, I would have spent so much more. If you already know that this wash and conditioner works well for you - go for it and get the big bottles. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week and I haven&#x27;t made a dent in these bottles yet. Only wish they came with pumps!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem the same as what I purchased at the salon and Ulta.  Even smelled differently.....</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner were recommended after a haircut. It is great products you can use the conditioner as a shampoo between using the No Poo.  These are great products for people with curly or wavy hair and doesn&#x27;t cause the frizzies.</li>
    <li> This duo pack is definitely the best deal around...A good bang for your buck. These products are amazing and in this jumbo size will last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I got a sample of DevaCurl in a Birchbox long ago, but didn&#x27;t receive enough to determine if it was really any good. I&#x27;ve recently decided to move towards the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; movement, mostly because I have very long, fine, wavy, dry, colored, difficult to manage hair and washing it is a pain in the you-know-what. I also wanted a healthier, sustainable hair care option. I wash my hair once a week. Enter: DevaCare. I decided to try this instead of DevaCurl because my hair is more wavy and is also colored. Plus, the combo pack with the conditioner was a steal. I can tell these bottles will last me months. I use so little product compared to previous brands, and it goes so far. Especially the conditioner!!  The smell is lightly reminiscent of orange, but not overpowering. It rinses out easily and leaves my hair feeling so soft. I don&#x27;t have tangles after the shower anymore!!! I was worried these would leave my hair slightly oily since they&#x27;re so moisturizing, but I can still go a week after washing without any problems - maybe just a little dry shampoo now and then. If you&#x27;re thinking about switching...do it! You&#x27;ll be so pleased. I do recommend washing less often than normal if you are a frequent washer. This shampoo/conditioner will allow you to do that, but you have to let your hair adjust to it which may take a couple of weeks (shorter for me because I already washed so infrequently). Buy some!!:)</li>
    <li> Defines curly hair and keeps the frizz down. I use the whole line of Devacare products and get lots of compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> Good product. i like the products of deva care.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this product . i will buy this a another ocasion</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, I found that this is the best shampoo and conditioner on the market.  The shampoo itself is made not to produce a lot of soap, hence the name No poo The few salons that sell it charge much more than I paid for it through this seller.  It&#x27;s an excellent product even for people with straight hair..</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t stay clean as long as it use to with other products. But it should be healthier for me so I&#x27;ll just wash it every other day instead of every 3 days.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Deva Care No-Poo and One Condition; the formulations are perfect for my thick, coarse, swavy hair. However, when I received the specific pair of products that I did, the No-Poo wasn&#x27;t completely full. Also, they do not include pumps, which are a pain. I had previously purchased the Deva Curl version of these products via Prime, and that vendor did include the pumps. Therefore, I give the actual product 5 stars, but the vendor of this pair 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for curly hair, colored hair, or hair of any kind really.  Use it and see!</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of ordering deva care. I have only purchased deva curl in the past. When I received it in the mail I thought it was a rip off and was not the product I ordered or remembered buying before...my mistake. I like deva curl alot better. I like the lemongrass smell and the condition has more slippage.  Deva curl does what you need it too but I don&#x27;t like the smell...it reminds me of orange cream with peppermint maybe. So beware before you buy know that there is a difference between deva curl and deva care.</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it, Love it.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to try out this product, but disappointed that the shampoo arrived already opened (or leaked?), and there was about two inches gone from the product. Not sure what happened and hoping to hear back from the seller soon.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little medicine like funky candy, but the result is undeniably great! Even my hubby uses it now and he has short hair. My curls became a witch to handle, DevaCurl put them on line and now they are wild and natural.</li>
    <li> These are fine, but, after a while it is hard to get them out of the spout in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love it and Arrived quickly !</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected thank you!</li>
    <li> The DevaCare One Condition No Fade Conditioner has a very unpleasant sour smell. Not pleasing to use on one&#x27;s hair. the regular One Condition has a less offensive odor.</li>
    <li> Great product! It cane quicker than expect and I got it the cheapest here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to coconuts. Every shampoo has a derivative of it. Evacuate is the only one that didn&#x27;t make my skin crack and dry up. AWESOME stuff.</li>
    <li> VERY satisfied.  Great product and delivered on time and not left where the dog could open first!</li>
    <li> I love all the Deva Curl products. They work amazing!</li>
    <li> I love Deva Care, my colored curly hair has never looked so amazing.  No more frizz, a great curly hair day everyday!  I gave this only four stars as the one conditioner bottle wasn&#x27;t shut all the way and some of it leaked out into the shipping box.  But, I can&#x27;t complain to much as I received it within two days and I love the product.</li>
    <li> This is the way to buy these products.  They will transform your curly hair!  The book, Curly Girl, explains it all.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Packaging is simple with easy to read labels, and products performs as per description.  Scent is pleasant, and both cleanser and conditioner are gentle and non-abrasive.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> love this &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; and conditioner for my colored, curly hair. these do not cause my color to fade and keep my hair moisturized!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Keeps my hair moisturized and defines my curls.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this is one of the worst hair products I have ever used. At the beginning left my hair dull, opaque and left my hair dried. I have natural curly hair, but the entire line of DevaCurl products left my hair feeling rough, dry and extra texturized. These merchandise did not meet and not exceed my expectations. I am completely unsatisfied with these products.</li>
    <li> Really great shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> I love Deva Care products and I received these in a timely manner. Only problem was that I ordered two 32 oz One Conditions but received two 12 oz One Conditions instead.  I was able to work out this issue with Amazon, so all in all, I was pleased with the purchase and especially pleased with the manner that Amazon helped resolve the incorrect size issue.</li>
    <li> For the first time I&#x27;m able to use a conditioner and gel on my curls without having to use tons of hairspray to control my frizzy hair. My curls look much healthier, I don&#x27;t even use a comb in the shower to detangle my hair only my fingers. I&#x27;m happy that my husband decided to buy me these amazing products for my hair. He loves my curly hair and he will do anything in order for me not to go straight. Lol .  Yes , its a lil pricey but worth it. Thank you DevaCurl!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly thick hair, not wavy, but actual springy curls. I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren&#x27;t any better than their cheaper counterparts. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products. Head to Target for the same type of shampoo, Frizz-Free stuff, gel &amp; condition without bruising your credit card. My opinion only, but I&#x27;ve found better products for my curly hair at Ross&#x27;, TJ Max and Marshalls. Plus using a little virgin olive oil added to my conditioner has tamed the frizz. It&#x27;s cheap &amp; it works.</li>
