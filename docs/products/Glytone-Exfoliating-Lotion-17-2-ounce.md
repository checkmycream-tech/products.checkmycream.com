      <li>This product is great!  </li>
      <li>I am so happy that I can get this product through amazon!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done at a really great price.</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my acne prone skin, look &amp; feel so wonderful!</li>
      <li>I have always loved Glytone products and have used them for over 10 years.</li>
      <li>My skin looks great, feels great and is blemish free.  </li>
      <li>So, it&#x27;s best to use this product nightly on the entire face.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Be sure to work your way up to step 3 if you haven&#x27;t exfoliated before.</li>
      <li>This is a stronger concentration, and better than what I was getting at my dermatologists office.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for maintaining healthy young looking skin at any age.</li>
      <li>My wife swears by this stuff and it works great for keeping her skin clear.</li>
      <li>works better than others, without drying out skin, especially good for summer skin that is oily and sweaty, possibly too strong for adult skin in winter.</li>
      <li>(I often follow the glytone with a light face cream which always takes care of the sting when it occurs.)</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really cost effective.</li>
      <li>You have been my go-to skincare line for exfoliation precisely because of the value you offer.</li>
      <li>But I am BACK to using Glytone and so thrilled!  </li>
      <li>At 41 I truly love my skin as much as ever.  </li>
      <li>My legs have never been so soft and more toned.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the results thus far.</li>
      <li>so you get it right.</li>
      <li>I really loved this product - it noticeably reduced the inconsistencies in my skin and made it really soft and smooth to the touch.  </li>
      <li>I had such a healthy glow</li>
      <li>I began with step one, finished the bottle and went on to step two, then on to step three which I have been using consistently.</li>
      <li>My first purchuse of this product through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I forgot last time how quickly the feel of my skin and its brightness improved.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It keeps my face clear and helps with fine lines, and doesn&#x27;t make my face dry.  </li>
      <li>This product works by doing some serious exfoliating to prevent clogs and breakouts using glycolic acid; that&#x27;s where the sting comes from and why it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it consistently for about 2 weeks</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest initially starting out with that dose, as it was a bit much for my skin to handle.</li>
      <li>I was even surprised at my reflection.  </li>
      <li>And, glytone 3 began, over a course of 2-3 months, to make a difference in my dark acne scars and lightened them considerably, to the point where I could almost entirely conceal them with a light cream foundation.  </li>
      <li>The price may seem a bit high, but you only use a teensy amount, so the bottle lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>Not only have my breakouts significantly reduced, by my skin is a lot less oily.</li>
      <li>It took care of a few minor skin issues that i had, such as fine lines and a skin tag! .</li>
      <li>sure not to use this product if your skin is broken or at all sensitive-</li>
      <li>I used this product years ago under the supervision of a dermatologist and liked it, that is once you get past the few seconds of burning.</li>
      <li>I just ordered a new bottle, but I amconfident it will last a long time like the last one did.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m seriously hooked  ...on the full line.  </li>

<li> The price on Amazon is less that half of what she was paying in a salon for the exact same product!</li>

<li> and it&#x27;s generally gone in a few days.</li>
<li> They can be irritating and make me red because I have very sensitive skin, but I use this at night so that is not a problem.</li>

<li> However, read the directios carefully</li>
<li> Received as expected!</li>
<li> No more red bumps.</li>
<li> I never stepped up using the 1-2-3 system (I went straight to 3), but I also did not increase to twice daily usage as my doctor suggested because I was afraid of dryness or irritation based on the burning.  </li>
<li> I had all kinds of skin issues - scarring from past cystic acne, peeling from dry Colorado air in some spots and oiliness causing additional breakouts in other spots.  </li>
<li> I strayed away from this product for about a year because I got pregnant and had a young baby and just had bigger things to worry about - but sadly during the course of my pregnancy I suffered horrible hormonal acne that left my skin scarred once again.  </li>
<li> I visited my dermatologist a few months ago, and he prescribed Glytone 2x/day.</li>
<li> If I do skip a few days and start to get a breakout, I dab it with Glytone Step 3</li>
<li> it can sting, to say the least.</li>
<li> If you do, you can&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>

    <li> My wife swears by this stuff and it works great for keeping her skin clear. The price on Amazon is less that half of what she was paying in a salon for the exact same product!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Glytone products and have used them for over 10 years. They can be irritating and make me red because I have very sensitive skin, but I use this at night so that is not a problem. It gets the job done at a really great price. Be sure to work your way up to step 3 if you haven&#x27;t exfoliated before. Otherwise it will probably sting quite a bit. Please be vigilant about wearing sunscreen _ always _ but especially if you are going to use exfoliating products. Otherwise, you will just cause skin damage while you try to undo your existing damage. And wouldn&#x27;t that be silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note to Glytone - do not raise your prices! You have been my go-to skincare line for exfoliation precisely because of the value you offer. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Been using it for several years. Love the way it makes my acne prone skin, look &amp; feel so wonderful!</li>
    <li> works better than others, without drying out skin, especially good for summer skin that is oily and sweaty, possibly too strong for adult skin in winter.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I can get this product through amazon! My skin looks great, feels great and is blemish free.  I am now you several of their products.</li>
    <li> This is a stronger concentration, and better than what I was getting at my dermatologists office.  I will keep buying this forever.</li>
    <li> I have used these Glycolic products for years.  This is a great product for maintaining healthy young looking skin at any age.</li>
    <li> Wow!  How often do we, as ladies, buy products and end up emptying our bank accounts and doing nothing for our appearance?  Not with Glytone.  I&#x27;m seriously hooked  ...on the full line.  At 41 I truly love my skin as much as ever.  With continued use (don&#x27;t stop!) it truly exfoliates and reveals the glow and shine of youth.  Warning:  don&#x27;t get too conceited.  I was in the mall, and, what, with all of the mirrors, kept seeing someone who seemed to stand out.  It was ME!!!  I had such a healthy glow I was even surprised at my reflection.  However, read the directios carefully so you get it right. If you do, you can&#x27;t go wrong!  ---Tina Louise.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It keeps my face clear and helps with fine lines, and doesn&#x27;t make my face dry.  If you have acne then try this product!</li>
    <li> I use this on my legs as my Dr. recommended for exfoliation.  My legs have never been so soft and more toned.</li>
    <li> Clears up skin after 2 uses.  No more red bumps.</li>
    <li> I also started with this product based on a recommendation from my dermatologist.  I had all kinds of skin issues - scarring from past cystic acne, peeling from dry Colorado air in some spots and oiliness causing additional breakouts in other spots.  I was considering laser treatments or microderm to treat my scarring, but was devastated by the price and told that I could not pursue any medical treatments until my existing breakouts cleared.  I paid an outrageous $60 to buy this straight from the derm&#x27;s office, but honestly even if I hadn&#x27;t found it on Amazon for half the price, I&#x27;d still probably pay the $60.  Anyway, I started using it once a day and it BURNS!  I never stepped up using the 1-2-3 system (I went straight to 3), but I also did not increase to twice daily usage as my doctor suggested because I was afraid of dryness or irritation based on the burning.  Instead, I just toughed out the burn and kept using it once a day, in the morning.  I used a collagen serum at night.  I really loved this product - it noticeably reduced the inconsistencies in my skin and made it really soft and smooth to the touch.  For people with cystic acne, you know how valuable that is.  And, glytone 3 began, over a course of 2-3 months, to make a difference in my dark acne scars and lightened them considerably, to the point where I could almost entirely conceal them with a light cream foundation.  I strayed away from this product for about a year because I got pregnant and had a young baby and just had bigger things to worry about - but sadly during the course of my pregnancy I suffered horrible hormonal acne that left my skin scarred once again.  But I am BACK to using Glytone and so thrilled!  I forgot last time how quickly the feel of my skin and its brightness improved.  I&#x27;ve only been using it consistently for about 2 weeks but I am already noticing the scars fading and the evenness of my skin returning to my pre-pregnancy Glytone glow!  I just ordered a new bottle, but I amconfident it will last a long time like the last one did.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My first purchuse of this product through Amazon. I am satisfied with the results thus far. I used this product years ago under the supervision of a dermatologist and liked it, that is once you get past the few seconds of burning. It took care of a few minor skin issues that i had, such as fine lines and a skin tag! . I will continue to use this product and purchase it throughout Amazon.</li>
    <li> Received as expected!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I visited my dermatologist a few months ago, and he prescribed Glytone 2x/day. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest initially starting out with that dose, as it was a bit much for my skin to handle. Not only have my breakouts significantly reduced, by my skin is a lot less oily. The price may seem a bit high, but you only use a teensy amount, so the bottle lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure not to use this product if your skin is broken or at all sensitive- it can sting, to say the least.</li>
    <li> Face is looking brighter 👍</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended the Glytone step series for me about a decade ago and I have been using it ever since. I suffered from almost constant breakouts around my chin and my skin was always oily. I began with step one, finished the bottle and went on to step two, then on to step three which I have been using consistently. Even now, if I skip a few uses (I use it at night after washing my face), my skin is sensitive. This product works by doing some serious exfoliating to prevent clogs and breakouts using glycolic acid; that&#x27;s where the sting comes from and why it&#x27;s so effective. If I do skip a few days and start to get a breakout, I dab it with Glytone Step 3 and it&#x27;s generally gone in a few days. So, it&#x27;s best to use this product nightly on the entire face. It doesn&#x27;t take much; I think a bottle lasts me at least 6 months so it&#x27;s really cost effective. (I often follow the glytone with a light face cream which always takes care of the sting when it occurs.) You won&#x27;t regret trying this product and will wish you had tried it sooner!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it.</li>
