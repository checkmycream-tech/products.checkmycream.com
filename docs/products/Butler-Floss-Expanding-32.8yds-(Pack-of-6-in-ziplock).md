      <li>I love it,  </li>

      <li>My dental hygienist recommended this floss since it expands and does a better job scrubbing between teeth.</li>

      <li>The way it expands really works great</li>
      <li>Great product, I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>If you have normal spacing between your teeth this floss works great.  </li>
      <li>As a very hygiene-conscious person, I really appreciate a great product when I find it and this floss is one of them!</li>
      <li>(it expands--or more accurately multiplies).  </li>
      <li>Nice to be able to order a whole bunch at one time.  </li>
      <li>I feel cleans exceptionally well for people who have teeth that are very close together.</li>
      <li>This tends to get stuck...not as easy as Glide.</li>
      <li>My gums are always perfectly clean &amp; healthy.</li>
      <li>A little more attention to design details like this would make a very good product even better.</li>
      <li>Luckily Amazon carries it!  </li>
      <li>This product can be described as dental floss , which is available at .</li>
      <li>Cavity free since I&#x27;ve started using it-</li>
      <li>The floss expands into a textured cleaning brush -- gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>First impressions: I love this floss</li>
      <li>I originally got this as a sample from my dentist.</li>
      <li>I ended up getting Dr. Tungs Smart Floss which works much better.  </li>
      <li>Our hygientist turned us on to this floss years ago, it&#x27;s the best but hard to find.  </li>
      <li>This is great especially when you have some space between your teeth because it expands and really scrubs between those spaces!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying it works great on teeth that are close together.  </li>
      <li>Works better than Glide and also doesn&#x27;t shred and get stuck between my teeth as normal waxed floss does.  </li>
      <li>This floss does a great job cleaning up where typical store brand waxed flosses just don&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this kind of dental floss locally</li>
      <li>and I really liked it, tried to find it, could only find it here.</li>
      <li>I think it is worth trying and then find out what the dentist office says re:</li>
      <li>This floss is truly is worth the purchase.  </li>
      <li>I have Invisalign braces right now and floss often throughout the day</li>
      <li>The single strand turns into probably 50 or so microfibers that easily stimulates your gumline and easily sweeps up plaque and/or anything else.  </li>
      <li>It expands when wet so it can clean better, and it does not fray or stick between your teeth.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!  </li>
      <li>Based on the recommendation of my dentist, the GUM Bulter Expandable Floss is so much better than regular floss...</li>
      <li>The way around this is before you use your piece of floss get it wet with warm water and let it sit a minute or two.  </li>
      <li>For a crown, the edges near your gums are often rougher than normal teeth and thus trap and hold more food.  </li>
      <li>When you first use it, it feels like it&#x27;s waxed, but I don&#x27;t think it is.  </li>
      <li>It cleans much better than standard string floss.</li>
      <li>After driving around to several stores and not finding this product I&#x27;m glad to have found it on Prime.</li>
      <li>it actually EXPANDS in between the teeth; and collects more food particles...</li>
      <li>Though I do not recommend it for teeth jammed together (for that problem use Glide), it&#x27;s perfect for cleaning the sides of those teeth slightly apart.</li>
      <li>I thought that I was getting a soft string like product that really cleans well and is easy on the gums.</li>
      <li>The best floss I&#x27;ve ever tried; gets in between the hard to reach places and especially teeth that are close together.  </li>
      <li>The price is fairly high but for something that helps a &amp;#34;quick builder,&amp;#34; according to my dentist, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>grabs everything between them, and cleans out potential plague between my other teeth with great ease.  </li>
      <li>You have to be very particular in order to keep it from shredding between your teeth.</li>
      <li>love this floss as it&#x27;s better at removing particles from between my teeth and has enough friction to keep plaque down, unlike Glide that is so slippery the plaque builds up faster for me using that floss.  </li>
      <li>It is very suitable for the removal of debris between teeth , so thick .</li>
      <li>If you have not used any expanding floss before, you haven&#x27;t been really flossing at all.</li>
      <li>The packaging has changed (the newer stuff is available in drugstores in Canada) but the product remains the same.</li>
      <li>I really like that it expands and almost has a scrubbing like texture.</li>
      <li>feature which really does work and gets all those hard-to-get-out pieces from your teeth.</li>
      <li>Really like the &amp;#34;expanding&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Very sturdy (ie, won&#x27;t break while you&#x27;re flossing) and does the job.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Orthodontist recommended to my husband and it works great.</li>
    <li> Great floss for people whose teeth are close together.  Gets in between tight spaces and does not shred.</li>
    <li> This is the third time we have ordered this product.  It is narrow and easy to use, and it expands when it needs to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been receiving GUM-branded floss samples from my dentist for years and had used them without any thought when my regular Glide floss ran out.  After finding out the the Glide floss really doesn&#x27;t do much for removing plaque (it&#x27;s made out of PTFE (Teflon) so it&#x27;s way too slick), I was looking for a replacement.  I was using the off brand from the local drugstore but it tended to get shredded between a couple molars and get stuck in there.  I&#x27;d then have to use a length of Glide to get the annoying fragment out.  The GUM floss never shreds or gets caught in my teeth and seems to do a good job at cleaning them.  The manufacturers tout this floss as \\&quot;expanding\\&quot; which it certainly does when you are finished with it and the tension is released, but I&#x27;m not sure how effective this \\&quot;feature\\&quot; is during use.  Since you keep tension on the floss during use, it can&#x27;t expand.  This floss isn&#x27;t the same as what my dentist gives me, but it is a very high quality product and seems to do its job quite well.  When you first use it, it feels like it&#x27;s waxed, but I don&#x27;t think it is.  I don&#x27;t see how it could expand if it were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good, strong floss, give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Based on the recommendation of my dentist, the GUM Bulter Expandable Floss is so much better than regular floss...it actually EXPANDS in between the teeth; and collects more food particles...This product was not available in any of the local pharmacy stores in my area...</li>
    <li> This floss is hard to find!  It is unparallelled in its ability to get food items out from between tight spaces in the teeth.  Especially helpful with tight crowns.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss ever!! I really like that it expands and almost has a scrubbing like texture. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I could NOT find this floss anywhere.. My dentist gave me a sample.. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> They very often do not expand.  Not sure why but they never expand right away, usually after a minute or so.  I ended up getting Dr. Tungs Smart Floss which works much better.  They are quite OK as dental floss but I got them especially for their expanding part, which does not work very well.</li>
    <li> It may just be floss, but I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Works great and a good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product&lt;br /&gt;for many years and find it an excellent floss that really cleans your teeth.</li>
    <li> This is amazing floss! It expands when it gets wet. Though I do not recommend it for teeth jammed together (for that problem use Glide), it&#x27;s perfect for cleaning the sides of those teeth slightly apart. After driving around to several stores and not finding this product I&#x27;m glad to have found it on Prime.</li>
    <li> Butler Floss Expanding&lt;br /&gt;This product was like fishing line.. I thought that I was getting a soft string like product that really cleans well and is easy on the gums. there are other products on the market that meet this criteria..Would like to return it.....</li>
    <li> I agree that the floss is the best, or pretty close to it. However, this newly designed floss dispenser is far clumsier to use than the older ones shaped like a cylinder.  The top must be pulled back quite far in order for the floss to clear it and be cut off, and this is inconvenient -- especially with wet hands in the bathroom.  A little more attention to design details like this would make a very good product even better.</li>
    <li> my dentist recommended this floss...it fits tight spots, but also cleans the teeth better than Glide.</li>
    <li> The Butler expanding floss is great for people with teeth that are a bit crowded.  It is a great product and for some reason virtually impossible to find in retail stores.  It slides between crowded teeth very easily and does not get stuck.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this floss. Doesn&#x27;t shed, expands to fill spaces between teeth.  Great product, I highly recommend. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Like it, do not love it. You have to be very particular in order to keep it from shredding between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Works great for me-- I have several crowns and spaces between some of my teeth are very narrow-- so, the size of floss can make a big difference.  This product is the only one I have found that I can get between &amp; behind all the spaces of my teeth without breakage or shredding of the floss.  Previously, I was using at 2 or more varieties of sizes for flossing- now just one.  It also has a texture letting me know it is working to clean between/behind my teeth as opposed to just sliding along edges with no friction like so many/most other flosses.  Dental exams are great. I have tried dozens of flosses over the years-  this one seems to work best!!  Highly recommend!!  So glad I found it on Amazon - very hard to find, if at all, locally.</li>
    <li> I have been told that because this floss expands when inbetween you teeth that it is better at disrupting the bacteria.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss ever made!!  My gums are always perfectly clean &amp; healthy.</li>
    <li> It expands when you use it. How else can I say how awesome this feature is? About seven (?) years ago, my dentist&#x27;s office gave me a sample of this and I&#x27;ve been using it daily ever since. Unfortunately, about four years ago I stopped being able to find it in stores in my area so I&#x27;ve been buying it online all this time. The packaging has changed (the newer stuff is available in drugstores in Canada) but the product remains the same. My checkups have improved since I started using this floss.</li>
    <li> Our hygientist turned us on to this floss years ago, it&#x27;s the best but hard to find.  I have been ordering from Gum directly for years but couldn&#x27;t get this exact expanding floss in the purple package.  So glad to find it again on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just started using this floss. Seems to be better than the others. I will go back to the dentist in 5 months and will find out how it is working on the plaque. Seems like the floss i have been using does not work very well or i am doing a poor job. I am expecting this floss to get rid of more floss and i am trying to wrap the floss around the teeth, per hygienist. I think it is worth trying and then find out what the dentist office says re: the results.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this floss since it expands and does a better job scrubbing between teeth. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it has the right balance of easily slipping between tight teeth and spreading out to effectively clean. For some reason, this floss can be difficult to find and I was thrilled to find it here at this price.</li>
    <li> My dentist includes this floss in the take-home goodie bags after cleanings. For my home supply I purchase it online because it is not sold in stores. This is without a doubt the best floss on the market because it expands when wet to help remove food and plaque from between teeth, instead of only massaging gums like other floss. You can actually feel and notice its superiority to other floss after just one or two uses. It&#x27;s like when you go from a regular toothbrush to an electric toothbrush: there&#x27;s no going back. As a very hygiene-conscious person, I really appreciate a great product when I find it and this floss is one of them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird to write a review about floss, but I love this expanding gum floss.  It is much better than the waxed kind.  Unfortunately it is difficult to find in the stores.  Luckily Amazon carries it!  My gums and my dentist appreciate it!</li>
    <li> If you have normal spacing between your teeth this floss works great.  If tight spacing it won&#x27;t fit.  Cleans good.</li>
    <li> She urged me to find this floss after getting a sample from her dentist.  I also like it better than other expanding floss.  The other brands I used in the past left little strings of floss jammed in my teeth.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t do that.  Works like dental floss should!</li>
    <li> First impressions: I love this floss gimme gimme gimme&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: really catches a lot of gunk and my hygienist loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: Cavity free since I&#x27;ve started using it- I can&#x27;t find this cheaper in local stores so I will continue to buy it on amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the Money / Would I buy this item again?: Yes</li>
    <li> I have had to look everywhere for this product so I&#x27;m always thrilled to find it here on Amazon. It&#x27;s the only floss I feel cleans exceptionally well for people who have teeth that are very close together. The price is fairly high but for something that helps a &amp;#34;quick builder,&amp;#34; according to my dentist, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for floss that works well, this is the floss for you. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t shred, it&#x27;s not waxed, and it gets into tight spaces. Thank goodness that Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> I originally got this as a sample from my dentist. It cleans much better than standard string floss.</li>
    <li> This floss is truly is worth the purchase.  I knocked out a front tooth back when I was 13 and now have a Porcelain crown in its place.  This floss is great because it does exactly what it says (it expands--or more accurately multiplies).  The single strand turns into probably 50 or so microfibers that easily stimulates your gumline and easily sweeps up plaque and/or anything else.  For a crown, the edges near your gums are often rougher than normal teeth and thus trap and hold more food.  This floss does a great job cleaning up where typical store brand waxed flosses just don&#x27;t cut it.  My prothodontists suggested this floss and I agree with him completely. I&#x27;ve never seen this in stores, and I&#x27;m shocked you don&#x27;t hear more about this floss.  It truly is incredible.</li>
    <li> The best floss I&#x27;ve ever tried; gets in between the hard to reach places and especially teeth that are close together.  A must if you don&#x27;t want to get cavities!</li>
    <li> This floss could be worse but we like the Glide floss a lot better! This tends to get stuck...not as easy as Glide.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer said the floss doesn&#x27;t expand much while it&#x27;s being used.  The way around this is before you use your piece of floss get it wet with warm water and let it sit a minute or two.  Run it through your fingers to remove any excess water and then it&#x27;s fully expanded and works GREAT! Fits into the tightest spaces and never frays or breaks. I LOVE this floss, the BEST EVER!!</li>
    <li> Best.  Floss.  Ever.  Crazy expensive for floss but worth every penny to me.  The floss expands into a textured cleaning brush -- gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> Does a great job scraping plaque off teeth. It&#x27;s a little thicker than some and may not work for someone with tight spaces.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re picky about your floss, you must try this.  Very sturdy (ie, won&#x27;t break while you&#x27;re flossing) and does the job.  Really like the &amp;#34;expanding&amp;#34; feature which really does work and gets all those hard-to-get-out pieces from your teeth.</li>
    <li> Some of my teeth are very close together and this has been the best floss as far as not breaking while trying to floss.</li>
    <li> love this floss as it&#x27;s better at removing particles from between my teeth and has enough friction to keep plaque down, unlike Glide that is so slippery the plaque builds up faster for me using that floss.  I have Invisalign braces right now and floss often throughout the day, this floss is perfect.  This is the floss my dentist introduced me to and I love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss! My dentist gave it to me as a sample because the other kinds I have used weren&#x27;t really working and I really liked it, tried to find it, could only find it here. The way it expands really works great and I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth feeling a lot better since I have used it. Highly recommend this floss for your daily flossing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss for quite some time now.  I love it,  I have gaps between my upper molars and this floss grabs everything between them, and cleans out potential plague between my other teeth with great ease.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying it works great on teeth that are close together.  I disagree.  I have to use glide between my bottom back to molars.  It&#x27;s super tight back there, and the expanding floss has actually shredded and got stuck between my molars.  I used glide to get it out.  I actually use two types of floss everyday.  I highly recommend this GUM expanding floss.  I&#x27;m about to order my second 6 pack.</li>
    <li> This dental floss is absolutely the best.  It expands when wet so it can clean better, and it does not fray or stick between your teeth.I take it with me in my purse and pack it when I travel.</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted.  Expandable floss.  Don&#x27;t know why Walmart and Walgreens doesn&#x27;t carry this but glad Amazon does.  Nice to be able to order a whole bunch at one time.  I will definitely re-order these.</li>
    <li> good product arrived on time and we are very pleased with this.  Our last purchase of this the floss was not perfect.  This purchase the floss was perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to floss. Really gets between the teeth and holds on to an impressive amount of particles. Other floss brands seem to just slip in and out without cleaning as much. This is great especially when you have some space between your teeth because it expands and really scrubs between those spaces!</li>
    <li> I thought that I had found an acceptable floss with Reach Unwaxed Tooth Floss (I don&#x27;t like waxed or the smooth flosses) but Butler was great!  I wanted something that would clear out the space between teeth (food does get trapped there and the smooth or waxed floss just work will in its removal.)  I also wanted a floss that properly cleaned both &amp;#34;walls&amp;#34; of the teeth that floss slides between without my making the extra effort that is normally needed with regular floss (okay, I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m a little lazy with my teeth care).  In both cases (food removal and &amp;#34;sidewall&amp;#34; cleaning) Butler does the job.  My wife loves it, too.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a more effective job of flossing my teeth.  Works better than Glide and also doesn&#x27;t shred and get stuck between my teeth as normal waxed floss does.  Just wish it came in a larger size (32.8 yards goes fairly quickly).</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this where I live, so I have to order it  The whole family uses it and it&#x27;s the only floss I use.  I have tried others and they never do as well as the Butler Expanding floss.</li>
    <li> Good buying experience.  I can&#x27;t find this kind of dental floss locally so I&#x27;m very happy to be able to get it here.</li>
    <li> This product can be described as dental floss , which is available at . It is very suitable for the removal of debris between teeth , so thick .</li>
    <li> I have been using the other expanding floss called SmartFloss for many years, so I have certain standard for expanding floss, which btw should be the ONLY floss to be sold to the public.  SmartFloss was Italian made while this was made in China, so I&#x27;m a lil&#x27; uneasy at first.  But here&#x27;s the direct comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SmartFloss:  Made in Italy.  Biodegradable and recyclable casing.  27m length. Scented floss.  High expandability.  High rubbing texture.  Prone to break from tight teeth crevice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butler Floss:  Made in China.  Recyclable casing.  30m length.  Non-scented.  High expandability.  High rubbing texture.  Less likely to break from tight crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  I really like the Butler Floss, at this time, I even prefer it over SmartFloss.  If you have not used any expanding floss before, you haven&#x27;t been really flossing at all.</li>
