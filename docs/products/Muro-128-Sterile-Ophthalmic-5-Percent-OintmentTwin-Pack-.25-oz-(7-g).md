      <li>I would most assuredly recommend to anyone with the same condition.</li>

      <li>It really helps with my eye condition.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  much cheaper at Amazon</li>

      <li>This product arrived within a few days and easily shaved off a good amount of money from the usual price we pay.    </li>
      <li>Must have it every night and we live 60 miles (one way) from a store that stocks it!</li>
      <li>You would be better off buying a similar larger product at a chain drug store!</li>

      <li>Sometimes it is just worth the extra money</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using plain opthamalic ointment, this works better.</li>
      <li>Then I discovered a new way to apply it that changed everything.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend it, since it the real deal, and it is at a much lower price.</li>
      <li>Muro 128 was way more gentle and soothing, and not as thick.  </li>
      <li>This is the exact same product that you find at the pharmacy, but it sells for 1/2 the price.  </li>

      <li>I rated this a 5 because it was received in prompt fashion and of course is the same high quality as what I would get in a pharmacy</li>
      <li>It took about 10 days to receive, so you may want to order early if you&#x27;re running low.</li>
      <li>It really gets rid of any irritation, swelling, and other problems I might have.</li>
      <li>Then roll your eyes 360 degrees with your eyes closed i.e. up, right, down left etc.  </li>

    <li> Very convenient way to get ointment I need daily. It saves me a lot by ordering instead of buying in a pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I liek this product and requested by the dr, and it is much cheaper&lt;br /&gt;than purchasing it at the store, will be ordering more!!&lt;br /&gt;  I</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this item.  It is much more reasonably priced than buying it from my local drug store and it was delivered quickly.  I will definitely buy it here again.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist recommends this to prevent cornea abrasions. Don&#x27;t like having to use the stuff, but a cornea abrasion is a lot worse.</li>
    <li> Sent in a very timely manner. I use it for a very dry eye condition and it was recommended by my ophthalmogist. Good product and vendor.</li>
    <li> This Ointment was recommended for me by me eye doctor.  My vis ion has improved to some extent.  I found it to be at a saving by using Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product just stopped an advanced dried-eye problem of my mom. Since she started using it +10years ago, the problem ceased.</li>
    <li> This product arrived within a few days and easily shaved off a good amount of money from the usual price we pay.    I would definitely recommend it, since it the real deal, and it is at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It really helps with my eye condition.  Does anyone recommend a product to remove it the following morning?</li>
    <li> Product received on time, as stated, and in good condition. Extra perk was that this was a twin pack and still less expensive than from the vet&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my ophthalmologist as necessary daily.  It does the job of keeping my eyes moist.  while helping protect damaged corneas.</li>
    <li> I only received ONE VERY SMALL TUBE of the ointment and was dissappointed with the amount I got for the price paid!  You would be better off buying a similar larger product at a chain drug store!</li>
    <li> This ointment is very good for dry eyes. I use it nightly since I had Lasik surgery to correct my vision.</li>
    <li> I suffered extreme pain and felt like my eyes were sticking to the sockets when I slept. I tried all kinds of eye drops thinking it was allergies, etc. Finally it became unbearable! When the doctor examined my eyes he confirmed what I felt was happening....they were indeed sticking and I had torn my cornea. He recommended Muro 128. I was not familiar with it and it&#x27;s hard to find, but since Aug. 2012 I have not missed a night&#x27;s use! I was fortunate, at my follow up visit the doctor said it was healing nicely and to continue the Muro 128.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviewers have mentioned to be sure and apply the ointment and be sure to roll your eye around to distribute the ointment. If in doubt, put in more! You need to be sure you coat the eye thoroughly before you go to sleep. I am post menopause and believe that may be a contributing factor. I have noticed that if I&#x27;m dehydrated or have failed to drink normal amounts of water that it will be worse....same for dry, windy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is approx. half what you pay at a drugstore....unless you go to Costco....but it&#x27;s hard to beat getting it delivered to your mailbox!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS to Bausch &amp; Lomb for a superb product that I will never be without!</li>
    <li> Had to have a repair done to my eye and doctor wanted me to use this. It works so I never miss using it and it was half the price of buying it locally.</li>
    <li> This is the exact same product that you find at the pharmacy, but it sells for 1/2 the price.  &#x27;Nuff said.  :-)  It took about 10 days to receive, so you may want to order early if you&#x27;re running low.</li>
    <li> Hard to get out of tube and in my eye. The ointment is too thick .</li>
    <li> Worked much better than the CVS brand.  If your Dr. tells you to use this, make sure you buy the brand name product.  It was even less expensive on Amazon than the CVS brand was in the store!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very useful, The product should be made available in INDIA.&lt;br /&gt;The product results are very good. This product is reccomended.</li>
    <li> Love the ease of ordering this product!  Must have it every night and we live 60 miles (one way) from a store that stocks it!</li>
    <li> This recommended by my doctor before bedtime for dry eyes. Works great. Wake up in morning still lubed lubed well. No discomfort. In winter, warm up tube with body temperature before use, otherwise hard to get out of tube and into eyes. Expensive, but worth it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. Keeps my eyes lubricated at night.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used it for over fifteen years. I am so glad Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> My furbaby has corneal dystrophy and I use a lot of this product for her condition. This was the best price yet and the shipping was the fastest ever.  Five stars all the way.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every night at bedtime - keeps his eyes from drying out.  Had am issue before but this helps</li>
    <li> The best.  Have used for years before sleeping so as not to wake up with eye pain from RCE.  Great price for this!</li>
    <li> Besides, its the only ointment my doctor lets me use. I like ordering it from Amazon because its here in just a couple of days, and I get a little bit of a discount for ordering in quantity.</li>
    <li> 11.9.13 I just paid $28 for one tube of Muro 128 5% at Walgreen&#x27;s.  I wish I had thought to check here years ago.  It&#x27;s  much cheaper at Amazon but I&#x27;ll wait until I have an order of various items totaling over $35 to get free shipping.  I&#x27;ve been using the Muro 128 5% ointment for at least 8 years and buying it at local stores.  I use it every night to keep my eyes from drying out and to keep from getting an abrasion--wonderful product. If I forget and go to bed, I&#x27;ll get up and do the ointment.  Kay in NC</li>
    <li> I use this nightly to help keep my eyes moist.  It is the best that I have found, and will be ordering more shortly.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be without this ointment for my Dry Eye Syndrome ... keeps my eyes moist all night ... be sure you buy the ointment - not drops for nighttime use.</li>
    <li> This is doing the job the doctor prescribed it for.  Thank you for the less expensive price than the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Same great product that I have been purchasing for years but in this twin pack I save a significant amount over the purchase separately.</li>
    <li> This was prescribed 3 years ago. I used to buy it on line from a pharmacy. Then it was recalled and now back. I buy it through Amazon because I get a better price.</li>
    <li> My order for Muro 128 was received promptly and in good shape.  It is a maintenance product for my dry eye syndrome. thank you s</li>
    <li> I have a problem with spontaneous corneal abrasions and this is the only salve that keeps my eyes healthy without leaving them filmy the next day. When I started buying Muro 128, it was 98 cents a tube. Recently I tried some other top-of-the-line products but found that I couldn&#x27;t see well the next morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It keeps my eyes from getting dry at night. It&#x27;s a great product recommended by my opthamologist..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months.  At first I had limited success with recurrences when I woke up in the morning every few days - which is very uncomfortable. Those who have suffered from this type of injury understand this very well.  Then I discovered a new way to apply it that changed everything. I have not had a recurrence in over 2 months now.  Instead of just placing it under the lower eyelid prior to going to sleep; be sure to close your eye immediately after inserting it under the eyelid.  Then roll your eyes 360 degrees with your eyes closed i.e. up, right, down left etc.  Do this a few times and then, still with your eyes closed, go to sleep.  This has the effect of spreading the ointment evenly throughout the corneal area.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor gave me a tube of this ointment three months ago after I had cataract surgery, and it worked so well I decided I needed more. Now I have enough ointment to use any time my eyes get dry and irritated. It really gets rid of any irritation, swelling, and other problems I might have.</li>
    <li> Helps give me overnight relief for my dry eyes.  Before, I had occasional corneal abrasions caused by the dry eyes.</li>
    <li> Just simply does the job as required by my doctor.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast service and product was just as it was stated on the Amazon page . Was cheaper than any stores and no running to the drug store.</li>
    <li> My wife has a significant problem with her cornea which was not adhering properly to the basement cells due to atrophy. The result was very painful ripping of the cornea exposing the rods. She has been using Muro 128 ointment for many years which has illuminated the painful tears in her cornea.</li>
    <li> My opthamologist prescribed this for me and I am very pleased with it. It works well. I use it during the night to keep my eyes from getting too dry.</li>
    <li> I have recurrent corneal erosion and this product is the ONLY thing that has saved me. I&#x27;ve even had a laser surgery to try and correct the problem. I keep this by my bed and if I wake up in the night feeling like my cornea has &amp;#34;split&amp;#34; (extremely painful, you&#x27;ll know if it has happened), I dab a bunch of this ointment in my eye, wait until the paid subsides enough to fall back asleep, and by morning my eye feels nearly normal again!</li>
    <li> I have used this for over 30 years as prescribed by my eye doctor.  It solves my problem.  x x x</li>
    <li> These arrived so quickly and it is a great bargain as I have paid so much more for the same product in the parmacy.</li>
    <li> Great product,  I use it every night.</li>
    <li> My doctor put me on this several years ago. I have tried a different brand, but it wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> I rated this a 5 because it was received in prompt fashion and of course is the same high quality as what I would get in a pharmacy</li>
    <li> Have used the product now for years and it keeps my tired old eyes from drying out.  Unlike lesser competitors, this stuff actually works!  Vendor, as ususal, is very prompt and reliable plus offers great pricing and convenience.  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before.  This time it burned my eyes!</li>
    <li> This product has always helped me when my corneal abrasion flares up. However, keep in mind that this is just saline in ointment form. The generic/store brands I have used work just as well and cost less.</li>
    <li> the doctor recommended it and it helps my sight. I like to find bargains and found this available on Amazon</li>
    <li> I use this ointment in both eyes every night on doctor&#x27;s orders.  It&#x27;s much less expensive here than in the local stores.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by my doctor.  It is a great product.  I also like it because I can get 2 for the price of one at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Is anyone else every trouble opening the tubes -- I&#x27;ve had to contact Bausch &amp; Lomb 3 times to request a refund. They say they&#x27;ve changed the cap, does anyone have any tricks to opening?</li>
    <li> The Muro twin pack was received in good condition. The price keeps going up however but its still better than local drugstores. Hope you can keep offering it on your site. Thanks</li>
    <li> It was much less expensive online than at the  pharmacy.  And it works great for my dyr eyes at nite.  My eye doctor recommended this product.  Been using it for years.  Will buy always online from now on.  Thanx, Judy</li>
    <li> Wife uses this to ease the symptoms of Fuchs syndrome.  Really helps her retard the progress of that illness.  Twin size a bargain.</li>
    <li> The ointment is very satisfactory and excellent value compared to the price here in Ireland.  However I did feel that the tubes arrived safely more by luck than judgement.  I thought they would be put in some kind of solid packing for safety but they arrived loose in a padded envelope.</li>
    <li> I was prescribed this product by an eye specialist for my Fuchs Dystrophy.  I use it every night before retiring. this was an excellent price for it as I was paying an exorbitant amount at my local drugstore.  I would most assuredly recommend to anyone with the same condition.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife who is pleased with the product.  Expect to buy ity again in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> just what the doctor ordered</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using plain opthamalic ointment, this works better. It has some 5% saline solution, but it doesn&#x27;t sting. The ointment is soothing when you apply it, then it reduces or stops the pain, and lubricates the cornea so that you don&#x27;t rough it up again when you move your eyes. It is expensive, but to me it is worth it.</li>
    <li> After using a generic for this product I found that Muro 128, the name brand was far superior.  The difference for me is that this product, unlike the generic, is preservative free.  Muro 128 was way more gentle and soothing, and not as thick.  Sometimes it is just worth the extra money and certainly when it comes to the care of my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great price for a product that I use on a daily basis to prevent corneal ulcers.  I will definitely be using this source for future purchases.</li>
    <li> I have to use this ointment in both eyes of my Boston Terrier for the rest of her life.  This is the same exact product you will find on the shelves in your local stores, but a much better deal here.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I have a degenerative eye problem.  This is the best ointment and my eyes are not in pain when I wake up after using them before sleeping.</li>
