### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good primer, at a great price!!</li>
      <li>so your makeup glides on easily and flawless.</li>
      <li>even the cheap makeup looks awesome with this product underneath.</li>
      <li>The seller was very truthful in description, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the difference between the two primers.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m so happy with the reduction in redness that I&#x27;m willing to make that tradeoff.</li>
      <li>Very light feeling on skin</li>
      <li>I have tried many products to cover them up with so so results.  </li>
      <li>I love the brightening Prime Time  </li>
      <li>and it was a better price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like paint -</li>
      <li>It makes applying the powder smoother and gives it a more even coverage.  </li>
      <li>Love this primer -</li>
      <li>Makes my skin smooth so the make up goes on nicely.</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly like the original</li>
      <li>As they grew and were sold in retail stores, I&#x27;ve become a fan of their eye shadows, concealer and their original Prime Time makeup primer.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny !</li>
      <li>When I ordered this, I thought it was the Original Formula, which is clear and leaves a very smooth finish</li>
      <li>However, when you cover it with your foundation, it provides GREAT coverage and reduces dark spots!</li>
      <li>To be truthful, I ordered this tinted primer in error, but thought, what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it, since I do like the clear primer.</li>
      <li>Next time I will pay much better attention to the detailed description.</li>
      <li>It is fine and works well, I just prefer the original clear primer</li>
      <li>I love Bare Escentuals products but did not like this primer at al!</li>
      <li>I bought it at a department store first but then checked Amazon</li>
      <li>Make-up can be worn without it and looks as good, if not better.</li>
      <li>This one does not do that very well.</li>
      <li>I have gone back to the light and \\&quot;feel  good\\&quot;,  brightening version Prime Time.</li>
      <li>I have a red undertone to my skin and this works so great to even out my skin and hide the redness without making me look pale.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use the regular primer this one does not work as well as the regular primer ...</li>
      <li>I have some redder skin around my nose and acne marks on my cheeks and this dulls those areas very effectively but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or cakey.</li>
      <li>It works very well as a primer under the bare minerals powder makeup.  </li>
      <li>This product completely rocked my world!</li>
      <li>I still used it but would recommend the clear primer instead.  </li>
      <li>I like the clear primer, it doesnt make your makeup change on you.</li>
      <li>I thought I had ordered Prime Time Primer (clear) and this is tinted and I can&#x27;t use it because it irritetes my eyes.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read other reviews before purchasing, but upon doing so afterwards, I see that many users adore the product, along with a few remarking on the offensive odor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a regular user of Bare Escentuals foundations and blushes since they were introduced in infomercials.</li>

<li> Disappointed and surprised as I usually love Bare Minerals  And Bare Escentual products .</li>
<li> This was yellow tone and didn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
<li> I guess the FDA has standards that might not mean the same as common language.</li>
<li> Really helps camouflage the dark circles under eyes &amp; uneven skin color while helping makeup last all day without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
<li> This is a yellow primer that looks weird when you first put it on.  </li>
<li> Those never really had any effect on the redness</li>
<li> It was not as expected.</li>
<li> My shine is minimal &amp;</li>
<li> Not sure this is necessary!</li>
<li> I have used this product for years followed by a very small amount of the bare escentuals powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using different green primers for the past couple years to cover my rosacea.  </li>
<li> The neutralizing formula  not only feels thick, but didn&#x27;t appear to neutralize my skin.    </li>
<li> Love this product as a base for foundation application, liquid or powder.  </li>
<li> This product the Prime TIme is a small bottle but a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Buy the plain and use a well made product, this is junk.</li>
<li> I will say I think it makes my pores look larger than they have in the past, so that&#x27;s not great.  </li>
<li> I have always had excessive shine even after a few hours applying makeup.</li>
<li> When I am lazy, I use it AS the foundation</li>
<li> Not good.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed that it was not the item that I had purchased in the past.</li>
<li> This item has a tint to it and an aroma which I find unpleasant.</li>
<li> Their agent told me the product is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and the stench might be because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34; Fragrances are used to cover unpleasant smells of ingredients.</li>
<li> This is awful with the tint.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t have ingredients listed, nor does the listing on Amazon. I called the manufacturer about the chemical fumes rising from this product. Their agent told me the product is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and the stench might be because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34; Fragrances are used to cover unpleasant smells of ingredients. I don&#x27;t know what &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; means in cosmetics. I guess the FDA has standards that might not mean the same as common language. The product reeks of something similar to an eye-watering combination of acetone and wood glue. I&#x27;ve been a regular user of Bare Escentuals foundations and blushes since they were introduced in infomercials. As they grew and were sold in retail stores, I&#x27;ve become a fan of their eye shadows, concealer and their original Prime Time makeup primer. I have shopped in their company store to to experiment and do not like their skin care products at all. To be truthful, I ordered this tinted primer in error, but thought, what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it, since I do like the clear primer. This one doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly like the original It&#x27;s more like paint - in fact the smell hints of latex wall paint as well. I think the yellow color is supposed to neutralize redness. I didn&#x27;t read other reviews before purchasing, but upon doing so afterwards, I see that many users adore the product, along with a few remarking on the offensive odor.  Since there are no ingredients listed on the label, maybe they were meant for another country or maybe they&#x27;re spoiled or even counterfeit.</li>
    <li> This product the Prime TIme is a small bottle but a little goes a long way. Very light feeling on skin</li>
    <li> Love this primer - I have some redder skin around my nose and acne marks on my cheeks and this dulls those areas very effectively but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or cakey. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using different green primers for the past couple years to cover my rosacea.  Those never really had any effect on the redness but since I needed a primer anyway I kept using them.  I tried this one and sometimes I question whether I need to put makeup on over this primer.  I will say I think it makes my pores look larger than they have in the past, so that&#x27;s not great.  But I&#x27;m so happy with the reduction in redness that I&#x27;m willing to make that tradeoff.</li>
    <li> Love this product as a base for foundation application, liquid or powder.  Or I just wear alone.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth so the make up goes on nicely.</li>
    <li> It works very well as a primer under the bare minerals powder makeup.  It makes applying the powder smoother and gives it a more even coverage.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle now.</li>
    <li> It was not as expected. I thought I had ordered Prime Time Primer (clear) and this is tinted and I can&#x27;t use it because it irritetes my eyes. This is not the products fault, I just need to not buy on line.</li>
    <li> Really helps camouflage the dark circles under eyes &amp; uneven skin color while helping makeup last all day without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I thought it was the Original Formula, which is clear and leaves a very smooth finish so your makeup glides on easily and flawless. This item has a tint to it and an aroma which I find unpleasant. I was disappointed that it was not the item that I had purchased in the past. Next time I will pay much better attention to the detailed description.</li>
    <li> I like the clear primer, it doesnt make your makeup change on you. This is awful with the tint. Buy the plain and use a well made product, this is junk.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles under my eyes.  Its an inherited trait.  Not good.  I have tried many products to cover them up with so so results.  Someone told me about tie product.  After I put it on, my mouth hit the floor !  I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it covered the flaws.  Worth every penny !</li>
    <li> I have always had excessive shine even after a few hours applying makeup. This product completely rocked my world! My shine is minimal &amp; even the cheap makeup looks awesome with this product underneath. I&#x27;ve shared it with my mom &amp; she loves it too!</li>
    <li> Very good primer, at a great price!!</li>
    <li> This is a yellow primer that looks weird when you first put it on.  However, when you cover it with your foundation, it provides GREAT coverage and reduces dark spots!</li>
    <li> I have a red undertone to my skin and this works so great to even out my skin and hide the redness without making me look pale. I bought it at a department store first but then checked Amazon and it was a better price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking it was the same as one I purchased a while ago.  This was yellow tone and didn&#x27;t last as long.  I still used it but would recommend the clear primer instead.  The seller was very truthful in description, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the difference between the two primers.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years followed by a very small amount of the bare escentuals powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has red/pink undertones and this foundation takes the edge off and evens me out without looking unnatural.</li>
    <li> I love the brightening Prime Time  and so  thought I&#x27;d try the neutralizing one  since I do have red undertones.  The neutralizing formula  not only feels thick, but didn&#x27;t appear to neutralize my skin.    I have gone back to the light and \\&quot;feel  good\\&quot;,  brightening version Prime Time. It truly brightens my face.   Would recommend the  brightening but NOT the neutralizing .  Disappointed and surprised as I usually love Bare Minerals  And Bare Escentual products . I have used them  for years.</li>
    <li> Be sure to use the regular primer this one does not work as well as the regular primer ... the regular primer goes into all those wrinkles and evens them out when you apply foundation.  This one does not do that very well.</li>
    <li> Not sure this is necessary! Thought it was a spray, but a pump yellow tinted lotion. Doesn&#x27;t seem to help a lot. Make-up can be worn without it and looks as good, if not better.</li>
    <li> this has a yellow tint to it. It is fine and works well, I just prefer the original clear primer</li>
    <li> I love Bare Escentuals products but did not like this primer at al!</li>
    <li> Use it daily.  I like having a color tint so I can see where I place it.  I only use the tiniest amount over my sunscreen and under my foundation.  When I am lazy, I use it AS the foundation</li>
