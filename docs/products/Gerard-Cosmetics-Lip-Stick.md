      <li>Def buying more!</li>
      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>Love this color.</li>
      <li>So when this immediately looked good on me, it became my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I usually pair this with a Kat von D studded kiss lipstick on top in the shade &amp;#34;Agatha&amp;#34; and it makes a perfect nude lip for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>They are true to the color and its so pigmented.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very fond of the packaging because the top kept coming loose, but overall I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
      <li>Cute packaging, but the color I recived doesn&#x27;t fit the descriptions or the videos I&#x27;ve seen of other people trying it out.</li>
      <li>First time trying Gerard Cosmetics</li>
      <li>First off, I applaud amazon shipping.</li>
      <li>Not the cute matted look, just dry and chappy looking.</li>
      <li>Really recommend this lipstick!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>a little dry but other than that GREAT !!!!!</li>
      <li>Actually, I&#x27;m pretty sure you won&#x27;t even get this on without chapstick (or it&#x27;ll be hard to) because it drags on the lips.</li>
      <li>The lipstick is okay, it doesn&#x27;t last long and the color isn&#x27;t as pigmented as I would have hoped</li>
      <li>Not the dusty mauve pinkish color that I loved when I saw it on Jaclyn&#x27;s lips.</li>
      <li>Looks so natural and chic on anyone!</li>

    <li> The lipstick is okay, it doesn&#x27;t last long and the color isn&#x27;t as pigmented as I would have hoped</li>
    <li> First off, I applaud amazon shipping. I always receive my packages before the delivery date. So, A+ for that.&lt;br /&gt;Now to the nitty gritty. This lipstick IS a beautiful shade. I always have a hard time figuring out which lipstick goes well with my skintone. So when this immediately looked good on me, it became my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons. It&#x27;s drying if you don&#x27;t have chapstick underneath. Actually, I&#x27;m pretty sure you won&#x27;t even get this on without chapstick (or it&#x27;ll be hard to) because it drags on the lips. I wasn&#x27;t very fond of the packaging because the top kept coming loose, but overall I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> I love the color but it makes my lips look really dry. Not the cute matted look, just dry and chappy looking.</li>
    <li> Amazing! First time trying Gerard Cosmetics and I&#x27;m in love. They are true to the color and its so pigmented. It lats for a long time. Gerard Cosmetics are defnitely doing a great job with their products.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased 1995, after all the hype, even after seeing some of the negative reviews. I should have taken the advice. The formulation was terrible. It&#x27;s extremely drying, like rubbing a dry eyeliner over your lips. Maybe worse. What a waste of money. I could have bought a MAC Lipstick instead.</li>
    <li> For the price this product did not live up to it&#x27;s expectations.  Very dry and hard to put on.  The color does not last long at all.  I had high hopes, but it did not meet them unfortunately.  Too expensive and no good results.</li>
    <li> Cute packaging, but the color I recived doesn&#x27;t fit the descriptions or the videos I&#x27;ve seen of other people trying it out. My color was an orangey brown. Not the dusty mauve pinkish color that I loved when I saw it on Jaclyn&#x27;s lips. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good lipstick.</li>
    <li> Really recommend this lipstick!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just a little dry but other than that GREAT !!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! Just what I wanted I can&#x27;t stop using it! Def buying more!</li>
    <li> Love this color. I have a natural hispanic tanned skin tone and it&#x27;s hard to find a lip color that suits me this well. Looks so natural and chic on anyone! Feels great and lasts most of the day. Sometimes have to reapply after eating but that&#x27;s the case with any lipstick. I usually pair this with a Kat von D studded kiss lipstick on top in the shade &amp;#34;Agatha&amp;#34; and it makes a perfect nude lip for my skin tone. 1995 is an incredible color for both day and night looks. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A little dry on the lips</li>
    <li> Beautiful color for my olive skin tone!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color. I use it for everyday, it dried your lips out a bit but its super fab.&lt;br /&gt;Im buying this again for my mother.</li>
