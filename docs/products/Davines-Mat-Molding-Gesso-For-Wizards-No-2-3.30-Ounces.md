      <li>Best hair product ever.</li>
      <li>This product is especially effective if you have kinky hair.</li>
      <li>Best hair paste I&#x27;ve ever used -</li>
      <li>and this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>This is great, but they&#x27;ve discontinued it.</li>
      <li>Its durability throughout the day is remarkable.</li>
      <li>The hold isn&#x27;t the great (compared to a grooming cream), but not horrible.</li>
      <li>I think it looks great. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!!</li>
      <li>and i find this one to be amazing.  </li>
      <li>I style my hair many ways to look good.</li>
      <li>Having gone through over 30 different hair products over the years, I can honestly say this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
      <li>It would be perfect for ponytails to tame some of those fly away hair strands.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for many years and always recommend it to my friends.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for my slick-back hairdo, and this one is both beneficial and lacking.</li>
      <li>I love Davines Molding Gesso.</li>
      <li>I find this one to be much better because of a) price (about 10.00 cheaper per tin) and b) it washes out nicer.  </li>
      <li>Much better than others i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>and I got it in a timely manner and at a better price than at the hair dresser.</li>
      <li>If you do like a great hold sans shine, this product really is top-tier.</li>
      <li>I love this product it works great on my short spikes hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and fix your hair into almost and desired style.</li>
      <li>It is hands down the best hair styling product available for both men and women.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It smooths my edges very well!I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light but strong product.</li>
      <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>For slightly more conservative (or at least less vertical) styles, No. 2 is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>i used to use sebastian, redken and most recently, Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s SumoTec.  </li>
      <li>It has a fresh, mild scent, nothing too overbearing and the 3.30 oz tin can usually last him a month.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look greasy, It lasts long, it&#x27;s easy to style your hair with it and easy to wash it off later on.</li>
      <li>Really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>HIghly recommend!</li>
      <li>My fine hair tends to absorb anything I put in it and then go flat, but this non-shiny texture seems to stay and lets my hair be moldable all day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of hair products: Jonathan, Sharp&#x27;s, American Crew, Bedhead, etc.  </li>
      <li>definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this purchased!</li>
      <li>but it works really well on edges in particular.</li>
      <li>My husband has tried many different hair products but in the end, this is the only one that works for him.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I definitely like the smell of Sumotech more, but I really like how No. 2 adds a rough texture and a little more body.</li>
      <li>Great hold, very matte finish, (for short textured hair) package will last a long while, not a widely available product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and lotiony!</li>
      <li>It will keep your hair held exactly how you style it, and it&#x27;s not greasy or gross!</li>
      <li>If anyone can offer a suggestion as to which product to switch to that&#x27;s more like the old No. 2, I&#x27;d love to hear it.</li>
      <li>Its not heavy</li>
      <li>hair is VERY straight, sticks out from his head like a kiwi, and this is the only styling product that will hold it into fashionable looking \\&quot;spikes\\&quot; in various directions.  </li>
      <li>You definitely will still need a hairspray, which I highly recommend Sebastian Re-Shaper from Ulta ($16.99).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products during the years from very cheap ones to very expensive ones and this is the only one I am totally satisfied with.</li>
      <li>I just got the new Dry Wax new one to try.</li>
      <li>This is super stuff that works even in heavy humidity.  </li>
      <li>This product is like no other.</li>
      <li>Probably my favorite hair product, I have very thick hair</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m doing the fauxhawk thing, I generally prefer Sumotech.</li>
      <li>I am natural and sometimes need extra hold on the edges.</li>
      <li>Has just the right amount of hold and can be re-worked with a little water.</li>

<li> Last a long time...</li>
<li> Only things, I&#x27;d possibly like a different level of strength and shine, but only slightly and like this product enough I haven&#x27;t tried any others.</li>
<li> I like this product quite a bit; however, will likely continue to test other products and not purchase this again.</li>
<li> It does not leave any white residue like other waxy/molding type products he has tried, even when it is dry and has been in his hair all day.</li>
<li> you only have to use a little bit on dry hair.</li>
<li> it doesnt look like you have a bunch of product in your hair, it holds throughout the day, yet is pliable enough that you can mess with your hair.      </li>
<li> You only need a little.</li>
<li> This stuff leaves your hair looking like it&#x27;s dry and still moldable not wet and hard like other hair products.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t to extreme styles with it</li>
<li> guess I&#x27;m gonna stick with this one and won&#x27;t switch to any other product anymore.</li>
<li> only negative point-</li>
<li> but still lets you mess around with your hair.     </li>
<li> I turned to this product when I was unable to get my hands on a new jar of Bumble and Bumble Sumotech.</li>
<li> a small one- is that the can doesn&#x27;t twist to open because i find that after awhile, it gets difficult to open</li>
<li> It feels a little heavy when my hair gets below chin length, in which case I switch to No.5.</li>
<li> Not sure why they would change the formula so drastically.</li>
<li> It holds his style without being too hard.</li>
<li> My husband has been using this product for about 3 years, and he&#x27;s on approximately his 6th container.  </li>
<li> Cons: expensive, smells a bit feminine or like minty baby powder.    </li>
<li> Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> This is super stuff that works even in heavy humidity.  Last a long time...definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this purchased!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years now.  It is hands down the best hair styling product available for both men and women.  My girlfriend asked me to try it one day and she&#x27;s been hooked ever since.    I heard this product could be discontinued soon, so PLEASE KEEP THIS PRODUCT ON THE MARKET!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened, but this product doesn&#x27;t hold up like it used to. I&#x27;ve been using Davines No. 2 for years. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ll use on my hair. However, something changed! It doesn&#x27;t hold anymore because it&#x27;s not as waxy as it used to be. It&#x27;s soft and lotiony! When I use it now, it&#x27;s as if there&#x27;s no product in my hair. Not sure why they would change the formula so drastically. I&#x27;m so upset. If anyone can offer a suggestion as to which product to switch to that&#x27;s more like the old No. 2, I&#x27;d love to hear it. Thanks.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of hair products: Jonathan, Sharp&#x27;s, American Crew, Bedhead, etc.  This stuff is fantastic.  It has a matte finish to it, so it doesnt look like you have a bunch of product in your hair, it holds throughout the day, yet is pliable enough that you can mess with your hair.      Having gone through over 30 different hair products over the years, I can honestly say this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across.  Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Pros: Great hold, very matte finish, (for short textured hair) package will last a long while, not a widely available product.  Cons: expensive, smells a bit feminine or like minty baby powder.    I like this product quite a bit; however, will likely continue to test other products and not purchase this again.

    <li> the finest tile grout around. Pricey, but worth it. And if you get some on your hair, just smear it around.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried many different hair products but in the end, this is the only one that works for him. It holds his style without being too hard. It has a fresh, mild scent, nothing too overbearing and the 3.30 oz tin can usually last him a month. HIghly recommend!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for about 3 years, and he&#x27;s on approximately his 6th container.  This is one of two styling products he will use, and is quite meticulous and picky about doing his hair every morning.  I think it looks great. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His hair is VERY straight, sticks out from his head like a kiwi, and this is the only styling product that will hold it into fashionable looking \\&quot;spikes\\&quot; in various directions.  It does not leave any white residue like other waxy/molding type products he has tried, even when it is dry and has been in his hair all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my slick-back hairdo, and this one is both beneficial and lacking. The hold isn&#x27;t the great (compared to a grooming cream), but not horrible. You definitely will still need a hairspray, which I highly recommend Sebastian Re-Shaper from Ulta ($16.99).</li>
    <li> I turned to this product when I was unable to get my hands on a new jar of Bumble and Bumble Sumotech. I definitely like the smell of Sumotech more, but I really like how No. 2 adds a rough texture and a little more body. If I&#x27;m doing the fauxhawk thing, I generally prefer Sumotech. For slightly more conservative (or at least less vertical) styles, No. 2 is pretty awesome. Its durability throughout the day is remarkable.</li>
    <li> I use this on my roots to give lift and texture. It feels a little heavy when my hair gets below chin length, in which case I switch to No.5. My fine hair tends to absorb anything I put in it and then go flat, but this non-shiny texture seems to stay and lets my hair be moldable all day.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works great on my short spikes hair and I got it in a timely manner and at a better price than at the hair dresser.</li>
    <li> I prefer No.13 with stronger hold for my hair. because my Asian hair. I just got the new Dry Wax new one to try.</li>
    <li> This is great, but they&#x27;ve discontinued it. You can find the comparable product as Davines This is a Medium Pliable Paste.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my hair for close to 5 years and will always look for it. Has just the right amount of hold and can be re-worked with a little water.</li>
    <li> This product is especially effective if you have kinky hair. It smooths my edges very well!I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light but strong product. Its not heavy but it works really well on edges in particular. It would be perfect for ponytails to tame some of those fly away hair strands.</li>
    <li> I am natural and sometimes need extra hold on the edges. I thought a bit pricey but it does the job. You will not need to buy another one for years. You only need a little.</li>
    <li> This product is like no other. I&#x27;ve tried to find similar products that would provide the same look, feel, and hold without luck . Believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing beats this product.</li>
    <li> I love Davines Molding Gesso. I style my hair many ways to look good. And Davines has always helped me do this. Much better than others i&#x27;ve tried. Cleans up well too.</li>
    <li> Best hair paste I&#x27;ve ever used - next morning you can use hair dryer - no shampoo required!!!  It&#x27;s fabulous!!</li>
    <li> the stylist i go to uses davines products and i find this one to be amazing.  i used to use sebastian, redken and most recently, Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s SumoTec.  I find this one to be much better because of a) price (about 10.00 cheaper per tin) and b) it washes out nicer.  Also- it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative point- a small one- is that the can doesn&#x27;t twist to open because i find that after awhile, it gets difficult to open and then i end up squeezing until it bends and dents out of shape, making it more difficult to close.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  Only things, I&#x27;d possibly like a different level of strength and shine, but only slightly and like this product enough I haven&#x27;t tried any others.</li>
    <li> Probably my favorite hair product, I have very thick hair and this stuff is great.  It will keep your hair held exactly how you style it, and it&#x27;s not greasy or gross! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves your hair looking like it&#x27;s dry and still moldable not wet and hard like other hair products. It&#x27;s easy to apply and fix your hair into almost and desired style. you only have to use a little bit on dry hair. I have been using it for many years and always recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever. I can say enough so I will leave it at that and quit while I am ahead.</li>
