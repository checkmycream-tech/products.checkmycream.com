      <li>Love these for hydrating my eyes.</li>
      <li>I honestly have no idea if these work or not, as I&#x27;m not seeing any huge difference.</li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying these pads, super easy and convenient and a good reason to chill out for 15 mins.  </li>
      <li>It works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Each pack is resealable, fit great, very saturated.</li>
      <li>Love how cool and refreshing they are.</li>
      <li>and I think I have a more refreshed, smooth look after using these.  </li>
      <li>This has been added to my beauty regimen, affordable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me, they are refreshing but nothing amazing.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s best to lay down.  </li>
      <li>I use them for fine lines/wrinkles</li>
      <li>Then when I remove them my undereyes are totally moisturized and look great.</li>
      <li>For how cheap they are, you have nothing to lose to try them.  </li>
      <li>I have used different brands but this was too great of a deal to pass up.</li>
      <li>so cheap works</li>
      <li>I leave it in the fridge for a bit and it feels so good on my face - at home eye facial :)</li>
      <li>I just used my first set and love the results already</li>
      <li>these significantly reduce the swelling.</li>
      <li>and I am pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>They are worth the try!</li>
      <li>Just place them under eyes, pat gently to make sure they&#x27;re secure, and go about your morning routine - get your coffee, do whatever.  </li>
      <li>They dry out at about 15 minutes, which is a great timer.  </li>
      <li>Great for a quick pick up or for long term results.  </li>
      <li>But, they were cheap, and there are a lot of eye masks, so I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>But they are not as good as the thicker gel pads since you can actually sleep in the gel pads.  </li>
      <li>A big savings over box store items and as good.</li>
      <li>I do too, they really do give you under eye a refreshing feeling.</li>
      <li>Still, not bad for the cost.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second, I am trying them for the first time RIGHT NOW!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find them to be super moisturizing</li>
      <li>but  they dont help very much eye zone!</li>
      <li>Like it ....felt smooth after first use ....</li>
      <li>The effects are only temporary (couple of hours?), but its nice to apply them before a night out or special event.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more and use them every day!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and do not irritate my very sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Please read other reviews as MANY buyers have experienced this same issue.  </li>
      <li>I put them on right after washing my face.</li>
      <li>im not sure what it&#x27;s really doing, but it feels nice and sure depuffs my eyes</li>
      <li>and the price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I first got a pair with my derma roller and have been hooked ever since.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my appearance after using them consistently for a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>That was what my first set did.</li>
      <li>Took a chance on these to see if they would reduce some morning &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;baggy eyes&amp;#34; and they work very well!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> I have really bad bags under my eyes I just want something that will get rid of them, this did not fit the bill !  live and learn</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using them for a week twice daily. I could tell a difference after the first use..it wasn&#x27;t permanent but it lasted all day, which is awesome! I have a really puffy spot under my right eye on my cheek bone...makes me look so tired..these significantly reduce the swelling. Will definitely buy more and use them every day!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 packs of these.  One for myself and one for a friend.  However neither of us have received them.  I purchased mine a few weeks ago. I cannot review a product I never had the opportunity to test.  I am very disappointed in the amount of time it takes to ship these.  I was hoping these would be similar to another brand I use that is  only a few dollars more but for a little less eye collagen gold patches.  But I use them everyday so knowing it takes this long to ship, doesn&#x27;t give me time to even test them before having to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes feel hydrated.</li>
    <li> These came from directly Korea so not sure about the ingredients? Didn&#x27;t really do much, and I was afraid to wear them not knowing of overseas regulations on ingredients!</li>
    <li> I honestly have no idea if these work or not, as I&#x27;m not seeing any huge difference. But, they were cheap, and there are a lot of eye masks, so I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth. If anything, it&#x27;s something to pamper myself with when I&#x27;m relaxing around the house.</li>
    <li> This does truly work, I love them! Thank you for listing item!</li>
    <li> I applied first on underneath the eyes only but now-&#x27;cause the size fits well I apply it on my mouth wrinkles as well. Hope it works well.</li>
    <li> Love these. Perfect for special occasions where I want to look my very best. Easy to use and do not irritate my very sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> It seems don&#x27;t help so much.... but it still ok!!!</li>
    <li> Leo&#x27;s wife writing. Don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> They are ok,  but  they dont help very much eye zone!</li>
    <li> 30 sheets per package equal a very thin collagen eye zone pad, however, keep these in the fridge &amp; they&#x27;re a fantastic start to your day.</li>
    <li> Mostly I use these in the morning when I am doing my makeup. I put these under my eyes then do my eyeshadow. If there is any fallout from the shadow this catches them. Then when I remove them my undereyes are totally moisturized and look great. After that my foundation and/or concealer goes on great. Sometimes I also use them at night before going to bed. I just love these!!!</li>
    <li> Took a chance on these to see if they would reduce some morning &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;baggy eyes&amp;#34; and they work very well!  Was pleasantly surprised! They also moisturize wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I do keep them the fridge &amp; they are very decent eye refreshers for the $ if you&#x27;re on a tight beauty budget. Just make sure you keep them in ziploc to preserve their quality.</li>
    <li> im not sure what it&#x27;s really doing, but it feels nice and sure depuffs my eyes</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price! Love how cool and refreshing they are. I keep mine in my fridge.</li>
    <li> Well packaged.  Good item for the price.</li>
    <li> Made from Hydrogenated oils?  that is trans fat, I do not want to put it on my face!</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for. great product</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my sensitive skin. My Mom loves it as well. Eventhough there are a lot of luxury brands out there, give it a try and you regret nothing!</li>
    <li> These are great if you want something quick to help tired eyes, say before going out for drinks after a long day of work.  But they are not as good as the thicker gel pads since you can actually sleep in the gel pads.  These thin ones dry out after about 15 minutes so you can&#x27;t sleep in them as they fall off.  Still, not bad for the cost.</li>
    <li> Like it ....felt smooth after first use ....will continue to.use it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying these pads, super easy and convenient and a good reason to chill out for 15 mins.  I&#x27;ve not had a real problem with dark, puffy eyes but as I get older I&#x27;m noticing that there&#x27;s a bit of puffiness in the morning.  These seem to be working on that and putting them in the fridge helps if you need help in a hurry.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It arrived promptly. When placing the mask sheet under the eyes, it does not fall off  or slide off and I noticed improvement after three uses.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s so convenient to use. and the price is very reasonable. It does bring me some good change under my eyes. Also I already reordered some for my friend. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Each pack is resealable, fit great, very saturated. No complaints. Have not had them long enough to know if they really do anything, but worth the price to try.</li>
    <li> I used these under my eyes when i don&#x27;t have any sleep. It&#x27;s awake my eyes and help my skin under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying I did not receive my American flag keychain :&amp;#34;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I am trying them for the first time RIGHT NOW!! It&#x27;s night time and in going to bed soon.  I wanted these to help with the puffyness i get from my allergies.  They are very soothing!  For how cheap they are, you have nothing to lose to try them.  I keep them in the fridge.  I plan to use them in the am too so I can have the eyes of a 4 year old (I&#x27;m 27).</li>
    <li> I have used these for years once a month and have noticed a difference.  My eyes don&#x27;t have such dark circles, my salon usually puts them on at my monthly appointments and finally let it slip where they get them from, I bought them to use at home and love them.  They are thin and can&#x27;t be used during normal activities, it&#x27;s best to lay down.  Usually I have someone else positioning them, so as of right now I mess with them a lot.  They dry out at about 15 minutes, which is a great timer.  You could fall asleep with them on but they won&#x27;t be on your face when you wake up.  Great for a quick pick up or for long term results.  Will continue to use outside of the salon once a week or so.  -Valerie [...]</li>
    <li> These seemed really gimmicky to me at first but I&#x27;ve grown to love them. They are hydrating, seem to tighten up my eye area, and don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m 29 with only minor fine lines around my eyes and while I haven&#x27;t seen major results yet, I do appreciate how these patches seem to plump my undereye area. The skin under my eyes actually feels tighter after I use these, it&#x27;s a weird but very neat feeling. I don&#x27;t find them to be super moisturizing so do plan to use in conjunction with a nice eye cream</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product and they are shipped from China</li>
    <li> I love these ... I start my day with these and they do make a big difference.</li>
    <li> These are okay. I use them while applying eye makeup to catch any shadow fall.  Unfortunately, I only received one package.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference... :L</li>
    <li> Bought a 2-pack.  Like another reviewer said, these are very well saturated.  I keep mine in the fridge and use them each morning after I use a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone mentioned that they &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; on her face.  I don&#x27;t find that at all.  Really, they stay put.  Just place them under eyes, pat gently to make sure they&#x27;re secure, and go about your morning routine - get your coffee, do whatever.  They stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and I think I have a more refreshed, smooth look after using these.  I&#x27;ve had them for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;ll continue to use these - they&#x27;re pennies a day.  I don&#x27;t wash my face after using - and I don&#x27;t re-tone.  I leave the product on face so I can keep the benefit, and then use my creams, and later apply foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Originally I was frustrated because I realized this product was coming from Korea and thought it would take a long time. It came in a week! I just used them and feel like under my eyes are smoother. I plan on using them to reduce eye puffiness and circles. Very happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> collagen pads relieve the eye and refresh</li>
    <li> Love these for hydrating my eyes.</li>
    <li> Softens the skin around my eyes, starting to see decrease in puffiness under eyes as well. Just 15min a day. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> These provide good relief to the under eye area; they are very refreshing.  I wouldn&#x27;t say the benefits last all that long, or that they visibly decrease puffiness all that much, but they do feel good and for the price they are worth it to me.  I have chronic dry eye and so my eye area often feels irritated and anything that helps that gets 4 stars!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and great product!! Thank u</li>
    <li> These under-eye patches are amazing. I use them for fine lines/wrinkles but I gave my friend a pair and she said she thought they helped with puffiness. The effects are only temporary (couple of hours?), but its nice to apply them before a night out or special event.</li>
    <li> My under eye area just seems different after applying these patches.  I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a test ...I actually cut them in the middle and use half on top of lids under brow and half under...let me say they work&lt;br /&gt;great!!! I can&#x27;t believe it.  I have especially dark area right at the area next to nose where the eye comes closest ( tear duct area)  these actually make the area lighter and darker bluish skin below eye from thinness of skin seem better too.  Its hard to believe something so cheap works so well.&lt;br /&gt;I just hope they will be around forever!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used for two weeks.  No improvement.</li>
    <li> these feels so good to relax with while wearing</li>
    <li> My wife ordered it.She did not complain. I guess it is good. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery! I just used my first set and love the results already, I can&#x27;t wait to see the future results... This has been added to my beauty regimen, affordable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the money - LOVE them!</li>
    <li> These eye masks work as well as more expensive ones I have bought.  You can&#x27;t beat the price And the amount you get.  I like that they are in resealable pouches too.</li>
    <li> Love it, will order this again</li>
    <li> I love these.  Sometimes I dab a little fade cream around the area before I apply the masks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any collagen products before, but I&#x27;m very impressed with these pads. I used them&lt;br /&gt;as directed &amp; the fine lines around my eyes were definitely diminished. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t seem to work as well as the heavier type available but after they dry out I dunk them in green tea and use them again. Given the price I will alternate them with the other more expensive ones that work better.</li>
    <li> Great product loving them so far</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done much for me as far as change, but I use it in the morning to get rid of tired eyes and that&#x27;s worked</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as it claims, but it reduces my poofiness.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a few weeks now, I love them. I think they are the same as the one that the salon/spa uses.</li>
    <li> These eye pads are very soothing. I have sensitive skin and they don&#x27;t bother me at all. I have not seen a remarkable difference in my under eye area but I do like them.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat these soothing little patches for the price.</li>
    <li> Great price and good item. I will buy again. It smells good also. Just take a whole to get it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me, they are refreshing but nothing amazing.  About the same effect as cucumbers or tea bags on your eyes. I have some wrinkles &amp; dark circles I hoped that these would help but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my under eye area.  I understand it takes about a week to see results but after using I noticed that Methylparaben is listed in the ingredients on the package - I prefer not to use again.  Didn&#x27;t think to look at first because the Q&amp;A on this product states NO parabens and the ingredients are not disclosed by the seller.  This is a big deal if you have hormonal issues.  I also only received one package instead of 2, took me 2 calls to Amazon to get the issue resolved.  Please read other reviews as MANY buyers have experienced this same issue.  Instead of mailing me the missing package, they originally wanted me to mail back the single package so they could RESEND as a package of 2!  All because it is not sold directly by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these!! I first got a pair with my derma roller and have been hooked ever since. After using my derma roller I slap these on. In the morning I wake up with no noticeable lines and a plumped up eye area. This is a great deal for the quanity. I have used different brands but this was too great of a deal to pass up. When these dry they do dry to a paper like substance. That was what my first set did. I will be using these forever!!  Great results at a great price</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Fiance and he loves them. I do too, they really do give you under eye a refreshing feeling. My Fiance has noticed his puffiness has gone down and he has more of a clearer texture. Product was delivered FAST! TY :)</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product. It works pretty good. I noticed a slight difference with the first purchase - I used it twice per day,sometimes more. I have tried many products trying to get rid of my dark spots. This one seems to be working fairly well, as I have noticed a bit of a difference and hoping with continued use it will get even better.</li>
    <li> I did not get my free USA keychain with this purchase :( But I won&#x27;t let that affect my review of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a couple of days in a row now and I am pretty satisfied with the product. I am not sure if it is helping with my eye puffiness but it does make my eyes feel very refreshed and moisturized. It also makes my skin super soft and they smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on for 10-15 minutes every night before I sleep after applying my skin toner. The patches are saturated in the liquid and if you don&#x27;t move around so much or make extreme faces, it should stay put under your eyes until it dries out. The patches themselves are made out of a thin paper and soaked in the liquid. After removing the patches, my eyes feel refreshed and bright. I pat my skin so the liquid soaks in and then I wait until it is dry and then I apply an anti-wrinkle eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;The package is convenient since you can re-seal it and the patches stay wet inside. I haven&#x27;t tried any other eye patches so I can&#x27;t really compare this to any other similar products but overall, I like the way it makes my skin feel. I feel like I am pampering myself a little bit every night and it is nice. I would purchase it again since the price is good!</li>
    <li> Love this for the price. They are now a staple in my Freelance kit</li>
    <li> I purchased these about a week ago and I love them. They have really helped with my bags and dark ness under my eyes. I put them on right after washing my face. I then go about my morning routine and I take them off just before I walk out the door. They did not slide off my face either.</li>
    <li> This works wonders! I put this on every single night and it&#x27;s helped my dark circles. I stopped wearing the eye masks for a week and noticed my dark circles got worse! The price is really good for starters. Eye cream is still recommended to be used before/after applying the mask for added benefits.</li>
    <li> these eye masks are literally paper thin and dry up and fall off in about 5-10 minutes. Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my appearance after using them consistently for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome!! I leave it in the fridge for a bit and it feels so good on my face - at home eye facial :)&lt;br /&gt;Would totally purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I use them every day before going to bed. They never slide off my face.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant experience.  The variety works great.  A big savings over box store items and as good.</li>
    <li> Tried it everyday then I saw the good results after one week. It is really good product. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> these work well, seem to really help reduce puffiness</li>
    <li> So and so. Haven&#x27;t seen any results but I like the feeling of the mask on my face.</li>
    <li> My eyes are usually pretty tired in the morning and this is a quick little pick me up. I like to use the fan every night and it often results in puffy eyes for me. After using this I notice my eyes feel a little more at ease and arent as puffy as before. They are worth the try!</li>
    <li> GOOD TRANSACTION. PRODUCT IS NOT OUTSTANDING</li>
    <li> I have only received 30sheets. That means only one package.</li>
