    <li> Great cologne!! Smells very masculine but not to over powering, seems to last all day. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!</li>
    <li> good as it was described</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Its OKAY, the smell does not linger. Short lived smell.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the prompt delivery and the price</li>
    <li> My girl friend loves it, other girls ask me what it is so they can make their bf&#x27;s buy it. My other colognes are Acqua di Gio and Jean Gaultier Le Male... and this one is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I just wear it every day, I love the smell, and the girls love it too.</li>
    <li> Great cologne! I have several bottles of high-end colognes and this has become my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Ladies love this smell!!! GUYS BUY THIS!!!!!!!...need I say more??? Can&#x27;t go wrong with PACO fellas!!!</li>
    <li> This new perfume by Paco Rabanne it&#x27;s the best of long time ago I recommended buy it it&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. It&#x27;s not overwhelming or over powering. I get complimented on it all the time and the smell lasts. I&#x27;m definitely sticking with this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for about 4/5 months and i feel that the smell has changed and isn&#x27;t as smooth. Almost as if the smell is stale. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed considering the discount wasn&#x27;t a significant amount from going to a store like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This smells so great I bought it for my boyfriend and he loved it !</li>
    <li> invictus is a great spray however the one i received didnt seem to be the original invictus by paco rabanne it had a different color and smell</li>
    <li> Was described as it was written in the description.  I love the smell</li>
    <li> Paco Rabanne Invictus is my favorite cologne now, it&#x27;s an amazing fragrance!!!.</li>
    <li> excellent, he loves it!</li>
    <li> The odor is so short!!!!</li>
    <li> Smell great.  My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> yum yum love this perfum for men</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one, specially when it comes to the price. Way better than Paco Rabanne&#x27;s One Million. Now among my top 3 fragances ever.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness - my hubby ordered this cologne, and I think it&#x27;s our favorite one ever!  He smells fabulous!!  This is one of those fragrances that just pulls you in....  It does seem pretty light - it is Eau de Toilette.  So, if you don&#x27;t like an overpowering fragrance, give this one a try!  If you are looking for a more lasting scent - go for the &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34;.  This is a soft woodsy scent that is just heavenly.... there is no &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34;, no &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34; - just pure lusciousness...</li>
    <li> I really like this scent. Very manly and not too heavy. It is also very unique and I like the fact that not everybody has it. I originally smelled it at the duty-free store in BWI. Since I was on my way to Jamaica, I figured I&#x27;d get it back in the states when I got home. Well so much for that idea! Not carried at Macy&#x27;s,  Boscov&#x27;s or any other large fancy department store. Beauty outlet had it. I ordered it. Got it. Now I smell like a champ!</li>
    <li> I love this product. The scent is amazing, is fresh, soft and durable. I bought it for my husband, and he is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed in the fragrance.  Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great buy and smells great</li>
    <li> Not what I expected the smell did not last long and also not as strong</li>
    <li> Love this scent and I&#x27;ve been told that I smell great by a couple of ladies.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for me for my BiRthday.. i love parfumes. After i tried it on she said that she forbade me to wear this outside our home. i can only wear for her convenience :)) that how good this parfum is !!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after smelling it on a trip back from the UK and i fell in love with it. I can&#x27;t get enough of his smell and he gets compliments on it every time he wears it. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells awesome! Can easily be used for both day or night. Was about $20 cheaper than buying from macys or another department store.  The cologne is legit.  I had a bad experience buying cologne from the perfume shops in the mall and was sold a watered down fake version of a cologne so i was skeptical about buying this one but no regrets at all.  100% official.</li>
    <li> Not the fastest shipping, but great product!</li>
    <li> I would put this along side Polo Blue &amp; Mont Blanc Legend in terms of the type of scent...its a much fresher, sweater fragrance than Pacco Rebannes massive selling 1 Million. Its at completely the other end of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertising used for this product (testosterone fueled &amp; heavily sports related) is ridiculous and completely over blown. The packaging is equally as ridiculous and looks quite cheap sitting next to some of its competition. This is very much a shame as I think it will cause many people to dismiss or over look this fragrance without so much as a sniff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent begins with a big hit of citrus before mellowing after a few minutes into a sweeter, delicate, almost floral scent. I have had many positive comments on this scent and people are quite surprised when they find out what it is...as the packaging and advertising is so brutal and &#x27;manly&#x27;. Woman particularly seem to like it...it could actually almost be a unisex product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also one of the longest lasting fragrances I own, a little goes a REALLY long way. There is no need to use more than a single spray per application with this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this is as a day time scent rather than a night time choice, because of its sweeter note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think Invictus is a great scent....not quite up there with the previously mentioned Polo Blue or Legend, but not very far away. I almost feel that Invictus needs re-branding to better suit the scents personality.</li>
    <li> Very good! Original and very elegant! On time! Perfect seller, you can trust!!</li>
    <li> It just gets better during the day! Really good for me!</li>
    <li> This product is Excellent</li>
    <li> Great and beauty product</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling fragrance for men out there. It&#x27;s genuine and the scent lasts for HOURS.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! New favorite!</li>
    <li> I just love the way my boyfriend smells...</li>
    <li> It is not too good as I thought.</li>
    <li> I wonder if the makers of Invictus are the same company who also own Polo Cologne? Overall, it is a very good men&#x27;s Cologne.</li>
    <li> Amazing .. smells just amazing</li>
    <li> Amazing fragrance, highly recommend to successful men</li>
    <li> Cannot walk in a elevator to my downtown office without all the ladies flocking over this scent it&#x27;s so alluring..... Must purchase worth every cent.</li>
    <li> The product was as expected and delivery was good</li>
    <li> Great perfume surpassed my expectation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, add to my collection, will probably be a one time purchased.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, the girls gave me a lot of compliments. For sure the best cologne.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, very satisfied, always get great comments</li>
    <li> excellent product, very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> Great smell, doesn&#x27;t last long enough</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase, in fact I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this. I tried this with many different types of scents and brands of cologne in many retails stores but I couldn&#x27;t find anything better than this. Wonderful scent that lasts for a very long time. This product was quite a bit cheaper on amazon than in retail stores but still pricey considering many other products. It is however totally worth it! Love this scent and many other people have complemented on it as well.</li>
    <li> A real hit for my Son-in-laws birthday.</li>
    <li> Weak perfume&lt;br /&gt;if you have a good taste for perfumes then don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;m not a big fan of citrus, that being said it is good the later undertones are much better to me.  But I still get many, many compliments</li>
    <li> Terrible! My roommate sprayed a sample of this on himself this morning and 7 hours later I still cannot stop sneezing! This is the worst cologne in the world.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, not musky which I hate. And the bottle is really cool too</li>
    <li> Got people always asking what colon I&#x27;m wearing all the time.  Good stuff</li>
    <li> It has an amazing and smooth smell. Its smell is like a sweet. It doesn&#x27;t give irritation to skin and far way 5 meters a person can feel smell and its smell last a week in clothes</li>
    <li> best cologne paco robane ever make</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful .... I will enjoy this...</li>
    <li> I love this Cologne!! My absolute favorite</li>
    <li> WOW!!!! I love this stuff.. howevr be aware that ..yes it is a &amp;#34;prime&#x27; item and should be delivered 2 days later? but alough my prime account is paid up I did not get the prime options instead being MADE to wait four days,the Invictus is outstanding!! cant down such a great long lasting smell but Amazon should get it together. this is an ALL DAY OR NIGHT scent reguardless of others opinion.. &#x27;Anight scent&amp;#34; smelling good is smelling good day or night... lol.. lol a night scent??? come on huh?? get this if you want to have people say.. hey.. what are you wearing?/ you smell great&lt;br /&gt;R.Williams&lt;br /&gt;Bergenfield NJ</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it!!!!! Im really glad I got him this as a present. It smells awesome, great price, it came really fast and in excellent conditions.</li>
    <li> I have 1 million which smell very nice only problem its waaayyyy to strong. Invictus is sweet yet mild as well long lasting. Very nice smell which will be noticed by others. Its one of those must add to ur collection im not being bias just saying for its price and smell its almost perfect</li>
    <li> Amazing perfume. My lady loves when I wear this and it always sets a good mood</li>
    <li> excellent product, I recommend it, it is good quality and it is observed that is orginal. I loved it</li>
    <li> mmmmm love it so much couldn&#x27;t wait for Christmas to give it to my boyfriend!!!</li>
    <li> Love the scent!  More importantly, my wife loves it as well.  And random women that follow me around at work...and department stores...they seem to love it as well.  So I&#x27;ll have to stop wearing it outside of my house to prevent the stalking.</li>
    <li> I Sprayed it and couldn&#x27;t even smell it</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping.  Hubby was thrilled with his gift, I&#x27;m thrilled with price!</li>
    <li> Omgoodness this smells amazing on my husband! Love it! Lol and yes so does my husband!</li>
    <li> One of the best cologne in my collections</li>
    <li> Great seller and great products!</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing, is fresh, soft and durable. However, I think this scent is not for night party, but for working at day.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample spray of Invictus from the perfume girls at a mall and immediately knew I had to add it to my collection.  I&#x27;m sensitive to strong scents and this was the first &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; cologne I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache in close confines.  I&#x27;d describe it as a fresh, almost unisex fragrance - in a good way.  A little bit goes a long way and it lasts longer than anything else I use.  I lightly sprayed a business card for a &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; encounter and ended up leaving it in my wallet because the great smell returns every time I use it.  On the flip side, I reserve my favorite cologne(s) for work because this is too strong for the office.  I also have not received as many random compliments about Invictus as a coupe of others, but I&#x27;d still put it in my top five.  The price is a bit steep, but that makes it a bit more exclusive too.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband and he smell so good</li>
    <li> Excellent flavor endures to the end, though dances, train and swim in the pool because I play water polo</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, and it lasts all day. Everybody seems to love the smell; it sort of has a sweet smell to it but it&#x27;s very nice</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this cologne! It lasts all day and I love the changes it goes through during the day. As an artist, I really appreciate the design of the bottle. Shipping was also fast.</li>
    <li> Great stuff the woman follow me around sniffing  me .</li>
    <li> Reached on time , great product ! Price is comparable to retail fraagrance outlet , box was and bottle were in brand new condition.</li>
    <li> It smells good, but not as good as it smells on the magazines. :/</li>
    <li> Not the last thing in the world. I think &amp;#34;one million&amp;#34; by Paco is a lot better.</li>
    <li> The Scent was awesome! Unfortunately by day 3 the pump stopped working. Manufacturer error not the seller. Was able to replace it via a retail store, so no biggie. Fast Shipping for a better price!</li>
    <li> Best scent I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time!</li>
    <li> I like it so much, but I expected more about the duration of the Paco Rabanne fragance.&lt;br /&gt;As well I like it so much!</li>
    <li> amazing price and size</li>
    <li> Me costo Demasiado caro .!!</li>
    <li> warning, this picks up dudes as well as fine cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;went dancing with this beast on and damn did I get some attention. From EVERYONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOLOLOLOLOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IM so SEXXAY you already know! I wear Invictus, and put on a dam good show</li>
    <li> Thank you. The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> bought it as a gift and the person love it</li>
    <li> This cologne smells frickin&#x27; great!! The scent seems to last for a good length of the day.  It is one of those scents that starts to come back as you get warmer and makes you want to pull your collar over your nose and inhale deeply.  (If you spray your cologne on your chest like I do)</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for Father&#x27;s Day and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This scent is wonderful, it came VERY fast and was exactly as advertised. The bottle that it comes in is a little weid but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the bottle I bought it for the scent. It smells wonderful and the scent lasts a long time. I would recomend this to anyone who wants to smell nice all day.</li>
    <li> excelente es original</li>
    <li> Authentic cologne unlike most colognes being sold on amazon. Smells great. Just like how it is in the department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruity but subtle and has a nice under tone. Mostly suitable for men eventhough its fruity. Different kind kf fruity smell i guess.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell for a great price!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells amazing! Got some nice compliments. And the grapefruit with a hint of jasmine sums up this scent in brief sentence.</li>
    <li> This smells so great on my husband!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price and shipping time.</li>
    <li> The fragrance was wonderful and the gentleman who received it, loved it.  He had smelled it on one of those frangrance strips in magazines and requested it.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, you will smell very good.</li>
    <li> I am not A big fan of Paco Rabanne But This one Is exception, premium smell long lasting and exceptionally complemented by people.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, AAA+++ highly recomended</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it is loved.</li>
    <li> Fresh Summery aroma..</li>
    <li> Have purchased twice as a gift. Nice scent; well packaged and good price for # of ounces of cologne provided.  Department stores in NY sell it for more $</li>
    <li> My boyfriend love this</li>
