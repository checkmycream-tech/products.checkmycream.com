<li> It arrived very bent up, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal as the stamps that is used is so small.</li>
<li> The small section I did try to use though was not engraved deep enough.</li>
<li> Spent hours trying to get it to work....</li>
<li> I tried 3 different stampers and got the same lousy results.  </li>
<li> I got this plate a few weeks ago</li>
<li> Very poorly etched.  </li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

    <li> Beautiful plate arrived so quickley. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Beautiful plate! It stamps perfectly- Pueen plates are always perfect! Plan on ordering more!</li>
    <li> Was really looking forward to getting this plate.  The day I received it I tried it immediately along with a Mo You sailor  plate as well.  The Moyou sailor stamped perfectly, the Pueen fireworks plate was bent and I could not pick up a good image at  all anywhere on the plate.  I tried 3 different stampers and got the same lousy results.  Ive never had a problem with a Pueen plate until now.  Back it goes. Disappointed.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these stamps do what they suppose to do, but I guess it takes a lot of practice and the right polish. Fas delivery.</li>
    <li> Very poorly etched.  Cannot pick up images from plate.  Tried 10 polishes, 10 different stampers, and 5 different scrapers and could not pick up an image to save my life.  Spent hours trying to get it to work....I own over 400 plates and never had such a problem.</li>
    <li> I got this plate a few weeks ago and I&#x27;m in love. It is very well engraved the images pick up crisp and clean and they are aplied easily to the nail this has become my new favorite plate. I recommend this plate.</li>
    <li> This is my first Pueen plate and my first buffet style plate and I absolutely LOVE it! I have no issues with it. Every image stamps perfectly.

    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great Brand&lt;br /&gt;- Great Price for all the images&lt;br /&gt;- Variety of Patterns&lt;br /&gt;- Stamps Perfectly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not come with a case like some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a nail blogger and I recently bought this palette specifically for the Fourth of July. I was happily surprised that this isn&#x27;t just for the holiday! Of course I used this still for fireworks but I also found it great for other uses such as a zebra print from the bottom left image. The Images on my pinkie and middle finger came from this plate. I never thought I would buy a large plate like this for the money but it is very worth it and I am looking into more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this plate....its big n has tons of different images which makes this plate very versatile. And wthe price is also very reasonable....so another 5 stars from my side.</li>
