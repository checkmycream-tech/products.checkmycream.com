      <li>They liked it as well.</li>
      <li>I loved the look on here, and  knew I would love a gift like this myself.</li>
      <li>She really liked the gift.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed it, smelled good, made my skin soft, &amp; the wood curio was very nice, as an added bonus.  </li>
      <li>The products inside of this box were so cheap!</li>
      <li>You get a lot of product for the price and the case is cute, plan on using in my craft room, but there is no vanilla scent to speak of.</li>
      <li>The smells she loved and the cabinet is a great space for extra storage.</li>
      <li>More importantly, she really liked it.</li>
      <li>I opened the Amazon box, and am glad I got this as I know she will love it.</li>
      <li>I got this as a gift, and i was initially very excited about it.</li>
      <li>super cute gift for my neighbor.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised on a good, unique gift.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just flimsy and cheap looking.</li>
      <li>I seen this on Freida &amp; Joe and thought it would make a great Christmas present for my sister who has almost everything.</li>
      <li>The products don&#x27;t look too cheap</li>
      <li>The drawers barely fit the slots.</li>
      <li>I think I would have preferred that the finish was not natural wood (which is as advertised) - it looks ok, but kind of unfinished.  </li>
      <li>Thanks - my wife love it</li>
      <li>The cabinet itself, which I think is the real drawing point, is cute.</li>
      <li>Great scent and fabulous little cabinet.</li>
      <li>she was able to use the wooden container for decoration :)</li>
      <li>I love the natural looking woods, and feel.</li>
      <li>Received as a gift and the curio itself is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Overall, though, I do think it will make a nice gift, which is the intent.</li>
      <li>I figured the wood curio would look nice in my bathroom, but it is of very low quality and you can tell just by looking at it.</li>
      <li>It is a nice looking set but the quality of the curio cabinet is flimsy, and one of the doors wouldn&#x27;t close properly.</li>
      <li>The wooden box itself is very cheap looking.</li>
      <li>The hardware on it looks good, and it feels more or less solid.  </li>
      <li>My DOL loves it, and said it was so pretty she was holding onto it for a bit before she uses it.</li>
      <li>wish I had shopped earlier and gotten more of these.</li>
      <li>The body care products are cheap and barely smell.</li>
      <li>The body wash, bubble bath, were pretty cheap, It was very globby and didn&#x27;t make very big bubbles, or the body wash, you needed to soak the sponge a lot of times to cover your body.</li>
      <li>The lotion, spray, and bath beads, were pretty decent and did well.</li>
      <li>It seems like pretty decent quality and the little case looks nice.</li>
      <li>I think it would be a nice addition to a jewelry box or display some little items.  </li>
      <li>The picture makes it look cute when really it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really justify the price.</li>
      <li>opened the package and was very</li>
      <li>I expected something, better</li>
      <li>For the price its not really worth it for the bath and body set, but more so for the pretty wooden box.</li>
      <li>I mean the very adorable re usable wooden box.</li>
      <li>Did the job, it was a Christmas gift for a 13 year old girl who doesn&#x27;t like anything.</li>
      <li>It is a little smaller than I expected, but basically quite nice.  </li>
      <li>I was giving this to my mother and honestly it looks so cheap and just flat out ugly.</li>
      <li>It is so lovely that I actually regret giving it to my ungrateful rude bitch aka mother in law.</li>
      <li>They barely at all have a scent to them.</li>
      <li>Bought this as a going away present for a friend with sensitive skin.</li>

    <li> wife loved the gift she has not used it yet but she said that she will.</li>
    <li> When I got this the package box was fine but the one door was all busted up and the little drawer was broken in half</li>
    <li> the product was very cheesy</li>
    <li> Gift for my baby sister and she loved it</li>
    <li> i brought  this product for my mom, when i got it the front part was broken, very very poor fragrance.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift and she loved it.  Great scent and fabulous little cabinet.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift, and i was initially very excited about it. It is a nice looking set but the quality of the curio cabinet is flimsy, and one of the doors wouldn&#x27;t close properly. The body care products are cheap and barely smell.</li>
    <li> I am pretty disappointed with this product. I figured the wood curio would look nice in my bathroom, but it is of very low quality and you can tell just by looking at it. The spa products are basically on par with Bath and Body Works so it doesn&#x27;t really justify the price. Also when I received it  the bath salts had leaked and were rattling around.</li>
    <li> Set arrived and it was damaged. I returned it and was given a refund.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of product for the price and the case is cute, plan on using in my craft room, but there is no vanilla scent to speak of.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a mothers day gift. My mom loved it.</li>
    <li> Sent this to my mother as a gift. She loves it. The smells she loved and the cabinet is a great space for extra storage.</li>
    <li> I buy very little on line and was a little reluctant.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package and was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The wood curio was eye catching.&lt;br /&gt;The products made you feel soothed and relaxed&lt;br /&gt;It was a &#x27;good to yourself&#x27; moment.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had shopped earlier and gotten more of these.</li>
    <li> This is a great set, and by great set I mean the very adorable re usable wooden box. Great for gifting to someone by filling in your own goodies. They packaged it well, and the glass doors stayed intact. The body wash, bubble bath, were pretty cheap, It was very globby and didn&#x27;t make very big bubbles, or the body wash, you needed to soak the sponge a lot of times to cover your body. The lotion, spray, and bath beads, were pretty decent and did well. For the price its not really worth it for the bath and body set, but more so for the pretty wooden box.</li>
    <li> Did the job, it was a Christmas gift for a 13 year old girl who doesn&#x27;t like anything.</li>
    <li> The wooden box itself is very cheap looking. The drawers barely fit the slots. It makes an awful noise when I push in the drawers, and close the cabinets! The products inside of this box were so cheap! They barely at all have a scent to them. They&#x27;re like the 1$ ones you might buy at Walmart. I was giving this to my mother and honestly it looks so cheap and just flat out ugly. The picture makes it look cute when really it&#x27;s not. Also the shipping was late!!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed it, smelled good, made my skin soft, &amp; the wood curio was very nice, as an added bonus.  This was purchased at amazon.com</li>
    <li> Not a good product. Granted the packaging was nice, but the products are terrible. The bubble bath produced no bubble, but rather just dissolved in the water. The rest of the items hardly had a scent to it as well. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Awesome, it was a great gift</li>
    <li> This item is the best item you could buy for a family member or friend you really want to make happy this item is really a good item will make your house or bathroom a delicious fresh vanilla smell! choosing this item is the best choice I have ever made!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> A good find, so good , I almost kept it myself. It appears solid for the price point, the item comes encased in see through plastic with a bow. It can be used thereafter to keep trinkets in or other toiletries . I was very surprised on a good, unique gift.</li>
    <li> Received as a gift and the curio itself is worth the money. I love the natural looking woods, and feel. Haven&#x27;t tried the products yet but the packaging smelled  when I opened it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a gift.  It is a little smaller than I expected, but basically quite nice.  The products don&#x27;t look too cheap (I can&#x27;t speak to their actual quality - hopefully they are not \\&quot;dollar store\\&quot; products).  The cabinet itself, which I think is the real drawing point, is cute. The hardware on it looks good, and it feels more or less solid.  I think it would be a nice addition to a jewelry box or display some little items.  I think I would have preferred that the finish was not natural wood (which is as advertised) - it looks ok, but kind of unfinished.  Overall, though, I do think it will make a nice gift, which is the intent.</li>
    <li> Thanks - my wife love it</li>

    <li> It is so lovely that I actually regret giving it to my ungrateful rude bitch aka mother in law.</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift for Mother&#x27;s Day to my Daughter-In-Love. It was shipped to Hawaii. My DOL loves it, and said it was so pretty she was holding onto it for a bit before she uses it. She really liked the gift. I am very happy with the choice I made.</li>

    <li> It was sent as a gift so I do not know the quality.</li>
    <li> What a total and complete piece of crap! Arrived damaged and not usable. I had to send it back and get a refund. Very poorly constructed and was smashed upon being delivered. No fault to UPS, this is just so poorly made it would be impossible to deliver without damage. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> For the price I paid I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift to my Friend. She loved it.</li>
    <li> super cute gift for my neighbor.  she was able to use the wooden container for decoration :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend.  No special occasion, just a surprise. It seems like pretty decent quality and the little case looks nice. More importantly, she really liked it. I&#x27;ll call it a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> On of the glass doors was broken when I opened the box. Very disappointed as this is a gift :(</li>
    <li> Bought this as a going away present for a friend with sensitive skin. This was perfect and she loved it!! The smell was so subtle and it didn&#x27;t react at all with her sensitive skin. She couldn&#x27;t be happier and neither could I.</li>
    <li> worked like it should</li>
