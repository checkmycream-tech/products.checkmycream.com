      <li>+ so these are good.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and the light works great!</li>

      <li>but these seem to be a better quality.</li>
      <li>The light on these tweezers is seriously amazing and helpful.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>What a difference a light makes!</li>
      <li>They are okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they would be able to handle splinter removal too.</li>
      <li>Spend more for a better pair that you can use.</li>
      <li>work good but cause a shadow til you find the right way to turn them.</li>
      <li>I lost a great pair of LED tweezers and bought these on the cheap because my house is SO dim.</li>
      <li>A cheap piece of junk - the light doesn&#x27;t light!</li>
      <li>These tweezers work very well and the light does a good job of letting you see what you are doing.</li>
      <li>Great tool for working in dim light.</li>
      <li>The LED on the tweezers that I bought for myself worked fine.  </li>
      <li>Yes, the light works fine</li>
      <li>They were wonderful for a few days and then the bulb burnt out.  </li>
      <li>The light has an off and on switch</li>
      <li>The light is fantastic, but the tweezers leave a lot to be desired.  </li>
      <li>Can see the tiniest of hair to be plucked with the led light.  </li>
      <li>but I do like these tweezers and once the light goes out on them,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I bought several kinds of tweezers for splinter-removal and these are by far the best made and flush full-contact</li>
      <li>Light seems bright enough according to my wife who I o</li>
      <li>Good for the price as compared to others similar to it.</li>
      <li>If you have not used tweezers with a light, order it right now.</li>
      <li>Product light did not work correctly and I didn&#x27;t think the tweezers were as good of quality as what I expected.</li>
      <li>Very user friendly.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and this little gem is able to grasp even the smallest ones.</li>
      <li>I do wish I could find those in a lipstick sized case, but the only one I found was more than I wanted to spend on it:</li>
      <li>br /&gt;she said that it is exactly what she was looking for</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;she used it few times and immediately loved it&lt;</li>
      <li>Not sure its any improvement over a cheapie set in a bright room.</li>
      <li>They are really bright which will be helpful for small tasks.</li>
      <li>The ends don&#x27;t meet well, so they don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>It makes it much easier to find those hiding hairs that you want to get rid of.</li>
      <li>The light goes off and on constantly and the tweezers are not aligned.  </li>
      <li>These tweezers do not connect properly as tweezers should - the light is superb but with the lack of tweezer action they are worthless</li>
      <li>Kind of weird looking.  </li>
      <li>They have a wider clamp area than average tweezers and meet very well at the contact area.</li>

<li> So, not a huge loss as it&#x27;s inteneded use.</li>
<li> I got these tweezers because I have some hair areas that are hard to find.  </li>
<li> Just cheaply-made, don&#x27;t grip well, and basically poor.</li>
<li> The LED on the tweezers that I bought for my sister came broken</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> All the batteries were bad in the ones I ordered.</li>
<li> of disappointed in that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The light goes off and on constantly and the tweezers are not aligned.  I would send back but it&#x27;s a lot of gas money for such a tiny thing!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the light works great!</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well.  Tines fit together so nicely they pull the thinnest of hairs and the light is great too.</li>
    <li> I loved these when I got them.  They were wonderful for a few days and then the bulb burnt out.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the bulb burning out, I would have given these 5 stars.  I&#x27;ve had 2 pairs now and it&#x27;s happened with both pairs.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these tweezers:  one for me and one for my sister.  The LED on the tweezers that I bought for myself worked fine.  The LED on the tweezers that I bought for my sister came broken so I had to return them.  They are not what I expected. (I expected something sturdier.)  They are okay.</li>
    <li> Perfect and inexpensive. Can see the tiniest of hair to be plucked with the led light.  Durable</li>
    <li> A little clunky but do what they&#x27;re supposed to. Light seems bright enough according to my wife who I o</li>
    <li> These tweezers work very well and the light does a good job of letting you see what you are doing. They have a wider clamp area than average tweezers and meet very well at the contact area.</li>
    <li> I lost a great pair of LED tweezers and bought these on the cheap because my house is SO dim. Much to my disappointment, the LED light doesn&#x27;t work! The packaging says &amp;#34;batteries included,&amp;#34; but I guess mine were DOA.</li>
    <li> Ordered another pair that came with extra batteries.. but these seem to be a better quality. Love them and think they will work great!</li>
    <li> I bought several kinds of tweezers for splinter-removal and these are by far the best made and flush full-contact ends out there... best ones IMHO.</li>
    <li> A cheap piece of junk - the light doesn&#x27;t light!</li>
    <li> If you have not used tweezers with a light, order it right now. In fact, get two. What a difference a light makes!</li>
    <li> Great tool for working in dim light. The light has an off and on switch so it stays on until turned off.</li>
    <li> These tweezers do not connect properly as tweezers should - the light is superb but with the lack of tweezer action they are worthless</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use these for tick removal and eye brow plucking.  They are really bright which will be helpful for small tasks.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried it I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
    <li> It is odd to love something that enables one to see a rogue eyebrow hair, a sneaky nose hair wanting out of the confines of one&#x27;s nostril and worse of all a prickly whisker like hair on one&#x27;s face but I do. I have very fine hair and this little gem is able to grasp even the smallest ones. I totally recommend these for those pesky little areas that are hard to see and need some clean up. I&#x27;m sure they would be able to handle splinter removal too.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife&lt;br /&gt;she used it few times and immediately loved it&lt;br /&gt;she said that it is exactly what she was looking for</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 pair of these and one didn&#x27;t work when I got it and they replaced it immediately&lt;br /&gt;and without any difficulty but shortly after using the next one, that one &#x27;burned out&#x27; the light.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of disappointed in that but I do like these tweezers and once the light goes out on them,&lt;br /&gt;I use them for my crafting. So, not a huge loss as it&#x27;s inteneded use.</li>
    <li> All the batteries were bad in the ones I ordered.</li>
    <li> Bought them for the price but, as is so often the case, you get what you pay for. Just cheaply-made, don&#x27;t grip well, and basically poor. Yes, the light works fine but I need the tweezers to do the job and these are simply not up to it.</li>
    <li> No battery included!  Therefore no light. Tweezers were not angled enough and clutsy.  Spend more for a better pair that you can use.</li>
    <li> they do not work as good as you would think.</li>
    <li> The light on these tweezers is seriously amazing and helpful.</li>
    <li> Kind of weird looking.  A tad like a prawn in heat.  Seems to work okay.  Not sure its any improvement over a cheapie set in a bright room.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. The ends don&#x27;t meet well, so they don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> Good for the price as compared to others similar to it. I do wish I could find those in a lipstick sized case, but the only one I found was more than I wanted to spend on it: $23 + so these are good.</li>
    <li> Very user friendly.  Got it for my husband so will have to wait till after Christmas to see if this stocking stuffer is 5-star.</li>
    <li> We use these for tick removal on our cats and have ordered several for personal use and gifts.  They work fairly well but we have issues with the packing/shipping because one or two pair are turned on in transit.</li>
    <li> work good but cause a shadow til you find the right way to turn them.</li>
    <li> The light is fantastic, but the tweezers leave a lot to be desired.  The edges are really rough.</li>
    <li> I got these tweezers because I have some hair areas that are hard to find.  The light on these tweezers is bright and easy to use.  It makes it much easier to find those hiding hairs that you want to get rid of.</li>
    <li> It was sent and delivered on time. Product light did not work correctly and I didn&#x27;t think the tweezers were as good of quality as what I expected.</li>
