      <li>Great for oily skin, really moisturizes.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>been using this for years, love the product</li>
      <li>One of my favorite face moristurizers.</li>
      <li>The delivery time was even better.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I should have looked at this product more closely before ordering.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
      <li>When I first started using this, about 10 years ago, I loved it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use (I haven&#x27;t wanted to use the 3-step cleansers from Clinique although others appear to like it.)</li>
      <li>So easy to just push a button on amazon and not hassle with the Mall</li>
      <li>great product consistently, and the real deal.</li>
      <li>this product is very light weight and is easily absorbed in the skin.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not suppose to smell like anything it&#x27;s suppose to be fragrance free.</li>
      <li>Light on the skin yet provides all day moisturizing effect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*As light as a gel</li>
      <li>I was on the search for a moisturizer that as light, but that had the moisturizing power of a cream.</li>
      <li>but it was exactly how it was presented-untampered, functional pump, fantastic on the skin and packaging that was appropriate and protected it well.</li>
      <li>It is totally worth every penny!</li>
      <li>MY sister-in-law was so excited when she received this item.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; which mean it&#x27;s perfect for spring and summer too.</li>
      <li>it is very fast!</li>
      <li>Finished the whole product!!</li>
      <li>I am 68 years old and &amp;#34;only my hairdresser knows for sure&amp;#34; because my skin is so smooth!</li>
      <li>but when they introduced this gel form just a few years ago, I fell in love!!</li>
      <li>but this gel this seller is selling is not the right product</li>
      <li>The Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Gel is very light cream, I like it very much!</li>
      <li>I am a 36 year old male - I have been using it for some months, and it feels good.</li>
      <li>For my skin, oil of olay beauty fluid is better and more cost effective as well or even the regenerist daily regenerating serum (which has a similar texture but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky into the day).</li>
      <li>I was expected a gel to my tipe of skin, it was ok!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very gentle as are all Clinique products.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>(My parents were both &amp;#34;wrinkley!&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>Would really recommend this seller!</li>
      <li>Love this Item... used Clinique since I was a teen</li>
      <li>I still have acne problems - specially when I try new products, but this hasn&#x27;t given me any.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is great since it doesn&#x27;t break me out no more!  </li>
      <li>My long time favorite.</li>
      <li>I have been using Clinque moisturizing lotions for the past 8+ years and have always loved them...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m getting older, but since I still have problem skin (to a much lesser extent), I can&#x27;t use the lotion because it is not oil-free.  </li>
      <li>scent is kind of harsh and sometimes causes certain areas of my skin to burn.</li>
      <li>This is a whole lot cheaper than u can get it anywhere else</li>
      <li>It really was what I was looking through Amazon</li>
      <li>I much prefer the gel to the lotion.</li>
      <li>This product is much more than I expected!</li>
      <li>I love the soft feeling of it, really good with my skin, however I heard that the Gel makes skin a little dryer which is what is happening to me, just a little.</li>
      <li>It is considered cheap to me because I use it once a day before sleep, and one bottle can run a long time (about a year).&lt;br /&gt;Every time I used it</li>
      <li>Definitely try a sample before you buy in full size.</li>
      <li>Not only did it come quickly (</li>
      <li>you can only smell it super close up.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and very prone to whiteheads as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I went to Macy and bought the right stuff same price.</li>
      <li>compared to many other moisturizers that promise the same thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find my combination skin is never dry and very seldom oily.</li>
      <li>Is like a pleasant secret that only you can smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you want you face to feel soft and moisturized you need the lotion.</li>
      <li>and it feels extremely soft ...</li>
      <li>far as changes - I haven&#x27;t seen any.</li>
      <li>For some reason, I started using the gel again, and sure enough, it left my cheek area very red because it wasn&#x27;t providing enough moisture.  </li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin though, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have normal skin, and this product actually satisfies all the needs of my skin.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and in my mid 30&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>To my relief, it was the direct opposite for me.</li>
      <li>Many lotions leave your skin feeling a little heavy and looking shiny.... but not Clinique.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this for several months but it did not keep my face moist. During the winter months when my face   is the driest this moisturizer did not help at all.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and in my mid 30&#x27;s. Not all the clinique products work for me but this stuff is great. Keeps my skin moisturized and doesnt break me out. Would recommend it to anyone.....</li>
    <li> MY sister-in-law was so excited when she received this item.  The price was good.  The delivery time was even better.  All in all, a very good sale!</li>
    <li> I use it along with the acne.org jojoba oil as my moisturizer. It is great since it doesn&#x27;t break me out no more!  I don&#x27;t use it alone, always use the jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my oily skin! No more breakouts!</li>
    <li> been using this for years, love the product</li>
    <li> was  what I expected..</li>
    <li> The Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Gel is very light cream, I like it very much!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years.  Everyone always comments about how I can&#x27;t be &amp;#34;That Old&amp;#34;!!  Thanks Clinique for an awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Clinque moisturizing lotions for the past 8+ years and have always loved them... but when they introduced this gel form just a few years ago, I fell in love!! It&#x27;s perfect for people with combination or oily skin! It is totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> it was that i expected. I was expected a gel to my tipe of skin, it was ok! thank you</li>
    <li> Just like I remember.</li>
    <li> ESTA HIDRATANTE ES MUY BUENA, IDEAL PARA PIELES GRASAS, ME ENCANTO,REALMENTE ES UN PRODUCTO DE CALIDAD, MI PIEL ES MUY ALERGICA NO PUEDO USAR CUALQUIER PRODUCTO Y ESTE ME CAYO EXCELENTE....MUCHAS GRACIAS</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the Only moisturizer I can use! Great for combination skin.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used; I prefer the gel over the lotion.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite face moristurizers. It did not affect my acne prone skin .</li>
    <li> Finished the whole product!! So great!</li>
    <li> I am a 36 year old male - I have been using it for some months, and it feels good. The smell is not heavy (just perfect!) and not oily at all.  I still have acne problems - specially when I try new products, but this hasn&#x27;t given me any.&lt;br /&gt;As far as changes - I haven&#x27;t seen any.</li>
    <li> My long time favorite.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I like it.It is good and comfort.Because it does not contain the oil,fit my skin well .And it is very fast!</li>
    <li> This is a whole lot cheaper than u can get it anywhere else and it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this moisturizer because I have combination-dry and oily skin (it changes from season to season) and this has always kept my skin appropriately hydrated but it was really expensive in Australia so I went on Amazon to look. It was a bit of a hit and miss system-there was some complaints on other products about packaging, shipping costs and no pump (not as advertised)! To my relief, it was the direct opposite for me. Not only did it come quickly (other products, I can&#x27;t say the same unfortunately) but it was exactly how it was presented-untampered, functional pump, fantastic on the skin and packaging that was appropriate and protected it well. Would really recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this gel. Tops on her Christmas list.</li>
    <li> I should have looked at this product more closely before ordering.  I meant to order the lotion and this is the gel.  Not right for my skin type.  I have been using clinique moisturizer for many years and did not realize I was buying the wrong thing. I am hoping  my husband will use it because I am too lazy to return it.</li>
    <li> Best lotion in the winter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, since I was a teenager.  When I first started using this, about 10 years ago, I loved it.  I&#x27;ve had problem skin for years and this was just enough to keep my skin moisturized without it feeling greasy.  However, a couple years ago I noticed that it no longer left my skin moisturized and I actually had dry patches of skin on my face.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m getting older, but since I still have problem skin (to a much lesser extent), I can&#x27;t use the lotion because it is not oil-free.  I happened to get a sample about a month ago while I was purchasing some other things from clinique.  For some reason, I started using the gel again, and sure enough, it left my cheek area very red because it wasn&#x27;t providing enough moisture.  For someone with truly oily skin, I think this works great, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  However, for someone with combo skin, like I have now, I say skip it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is amazing!!! I much prefer the gel to the lotion. I find my combination skin is never dry and very seldom oily. It&#x27;s also very gentle as are all Clinique products. For me it&#x27;s a 5/5!</li>
    <li> Before I start I have Combination/oily skin with some dryness around the chin and nose. My skin is sensitive and very prone to whiteheads as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now. I was on the search for a moisturizer that as light, but that had the moisturizing power of a cream. This is it for me. This product does it all. I have combination skin with some dry spots around my nose and chin. I used to have to use two different moisturizers to do the job without breaking out like crazy. This evens out my skin and I haven&#x27;t had many blemishes since.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*As moisturizing as a lotion or cream.&lt;br /&gt;*As light as a gel should be.&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;*No blackheads have formed since the use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;*No residue or tight feeling after applying.&lt;br /&gt;*Cheap compared to many other moisturizers that promise the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*In the dryness of winter, sometimes one application doesn&#x27;t cut it. I sometimes have to apply it twice or three times, but even with the extra applications I do not break out.&lt;br /&gt;*The scent is kind of harsh and sometimes causes certain areas of my skin to burn. I do have sensitive skin though, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product to anyone with my skin type. It&#x27;s my holy grail and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for over 3 years and the result is amazing. I have normal skin, and this product actually satisfies all the needs of my skin. it is soothing and keeps the moisture inside. It is considered cheap to me because I use it once a day before sleep, and one bottle can run a long time (about a year).&lt;br /&gt;Every time I used it I feel like I have used a mask.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with my skin, and this is just the solution I was looking for. Makes my skin feel silky and moisturized with feeling oily or greasy. Doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; which mean it&#x27;s perfect for spring and summer too. Love this.</li>
    <li> I have combo skin and have tried a few products. This product though does not feel moisturizing. And for some reason, a few hours into the day, my skin feels shiny and sticky vs. if I used something else. Definitely try a sample before you buy in full size. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to use this anymore. For my skin, oil of olay beauty fluid is better and more cost effective as well or even the regenerist daily regenerating serum (which has a similar texture but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky into the day).</li>
    <li> Love Clinique and ordered it for my daughter who is a fan too&lt;br /&gt;Have used Clinique for years and love all their skin products</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the reviews but I didn&#x27;t. I would have never bought this. I&#x27;ve used this moisturizing gel for years and love it but this gel this seller is selling is not the right product it&#x27;s a nock off or something this smells like mentholatim and it&#x27;s not suppose to smell like anything it&#x27;s suppose to be fragrance free. I contacted the seller and told them there was something wrong with it they said they would check into it haven&#x27;t heard anything back in a week now I can&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t know what they put into it and I&#x27;m not trusting it to use on my face I went to Macy and bought the right stuff same price. Don&#x27;t buy this gel from this seller it&#x27;s not the right product very disappointed and out money :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this clinique product for almost 30 years and I never use anything else. I use it under make-up..love it.. my sister got me to use this and she always uses it too!! Daughter-in laws and granddaughter uses this too..</li>
    <li> I love the soft feeling of it, really good with my skin, however I heard that the Gel makes skin a little dryer which is what is happening to me, just a little. I heard it has to say moisturizer for less dry version. I have combination skin, dry in triangle and oily around nose area</li>
    <li> this product is very light weight and is easily absorbed in the skin. I would recommend this for any type of skin.  It does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel has a really faint yet deliscious scent, like a  distant fancy sunscreen mixed with a drop of vanilla or cake batter... you can only smell it super close up. Is like a pleasant secret that only you can smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin soaked it up quicker than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. And no one can tell that I put anything on at all. Many lotions leave your skin feeling a little heavy and looking shiny.... but not Clinique. It looks and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> This article is best recommended. It really was what I was looking through Amazon I found what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin, really moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for over a decade, thus I know how it smells, feels, etc.  The product inside the bottle smells like a combination of diaper rash medicine and baby lotion.  I LOVE Amazon, but would avoid the seller.</li>
    <li> Light on the skin yet provides all day moisturizing effect. My skin loves this product and I love the &amp;#34;no odor&amp;#34; that it provides.</li>
    <li> Love this Item... used Clinique since I was a teen and now I am in my fifties, great product consistently, and the real deal. So easy to just push a button on amazon and not hassle with the Mall</li>
    <li> This product is much more than I expected! I really loved it. I recommend to all who have extremely oily skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake. I thought I was ordering the lotion. HUGE mistake!  This made my face feel dry and tight. If you want you face to feel soft and moisturized you need the lotion. Unfortunately they look exactly alike.</li>
    <li> I have used Clinique moisturing gel for over 20 years. I am 68 years old and &amp;#34;only my hairdresser knows for sure&amp;#34; because my skin is so smooth! I&#x27;m not a doctor, so have no medical proof of this youthful result as coming from Clinique, but don&#x27;t know any other reason! (My parents were both &amp;#34;wrinkley!&amp;#34;) It&#x27;s easy to use (I haven&#x27;t wanted to use the 3-step cleansers from Clinique although others appear to like it.) I just use basic soap and water! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> lasts a long long time.  been using this for about 7mths and it has smoothed my skin out and it feels extremely soft ...Not oily at all.  great product i stuck with it and it works as described</li>
