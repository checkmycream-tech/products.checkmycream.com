      <li>can&#x27;t seem to get it to hold standing position on a counter top...............holds great on a mirror.</li>
      <li>my grandson has arthrogryposis and it worked great for him</li>
      <li>LOL  </li>
      <li>but once it&#x27;s on the mirror it holds the dryer great.  </li>
      <li>Although the basics of this product is good, I have found it to be not as good as I was hoping.  </li>
      <li>I do feel that the most ideal way of having it permanently setup would be if you had a tiled wall/ surround.</li>
      <li>The concept was good.  </li>
      <li>but I love this product and have been looking for something like it FOREVER!  </li>
      <li>They told me they like it, but it falls off the mirror very easily.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I attached it on my full body mirror overnight just to see if it will hold really good.</li>

      <li>but it is how it is. :)</li>
      <li>I checked out many Dryer Holders before purchasing this one and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
      <li>Oh, by the way, I am 5&#x27;3\\&quot;, so, on my sink, it was OK for me.  </li>
      <li>Absoultely love this product.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife, wasn&#x27;t sure because \\&quot;as seen on TV\\</li>
      <li>Thought it was a gonner but turned out ok.  </li>
      <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to any woman and any guy who wants to win some brownie points with</li>
      <li>Love having two hand to manipulate my hair how I want it.</li>
      <li>I went through this routine a couple of more times, and the time between each fall got shorter and shorter.  </li>
      <li>All I had been doing was testing to make sure it would hold so</li>
      <li>I really do love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, the product is nice looking and functionally excellent.</li>
      <li>FYI, I cleaned my mirror first as well as the suction cup of this thing before I put it on, just to make sure that it will stay really good...</li>
      <li>Best product I have bought in a very long time.</li>
      <li>We are so impressed with this product we are going to purchase one for my wife’s Mother as she has problems holding her arms up to dry her hair.</li>
      <li>and you only have one good hand!</li>
      <li>(better tip: thoroughly clean mirror and blo-and-go with alcohol before application.     </li>
      <li>Flexible neck is strong, stays in position.</li>
      <li>I really liked it when I first got it.  </li>
      <li>Out of the box, on the mirror, connected the hair dryer and hands free drying.</li>
      <li>I like the idea of hands free drying.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used it in the laundry room for drying my dog after her bath, so that I can have both hands available.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>Very useful item if it would stay up.  </li>
      <li>came quick, work fine for about a week now</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it really is hands-free, but it is quite a monstrosity!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the strength of hold the suction cup has on my mirror, the whole thing feels very sturdy!</li>
      <li>I would most certainly recomend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>It looks cool attached to my bathroom mirror.  </li>
      <li>Really wish they made something like this that is a sturdy stand that will not fall over easily.</li>
      <li>This makes drying my hair so easy and fast.</li>
      <li>If you are taller, you may need to sit down or put it on something more like a kitchen counter for your own comfort.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product and has cut down the drying time from 30 mins to 12!</li>
      <li>A few women I&#x27;ve told about the gift thought it was great too.  </li>
      <li>Needs to be permanently mounted in order to be truly useful.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Blo &amp; Go for nearly two years and love it.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>right,</li>
      <li>I have a calcium deposit in my right shoulder and am right handed.</li>
      <li>I bought this item because I was having surgery on my right arm and right hand.  </li>
      <li>so I can use my right arm to style my hair.</li>
      <li>I am right handed.  </li>
      <li>It took me awhile to find the correct height that I wanted it and the right bend, so I feel like I have to leave it up.</li>
      <li>The trick now is just putting your head in the right spot for the dryer to blow on it.  </li>
      <li>I can blow dry hair while device securely holds blow dryer and can safely move it in any direction.</li>
      <li>All of those things aside it worked great with my small sized blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>cleaned the surface of the mirror in every form in order to make sure that this is not such a problem,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Note: It MUST be attached to a non-porous surface such as a mirror (or the top of the washer or dryer in the case of the dog-drying).</li>
      <li>First it doesn&#x27;t have to be mounted on wall</li>
      <li>exactly what i had been looking for.  </li>
      <li>it happened the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>It has to be removed after each use or it will fall down on its own -</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and has been a big help.  </li>
      <li>and I cant say enough as to how easy and convenient it has been for me.</li>
      <li>Dispite the large suction cup it still fell off of my mirror.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not in my way TOO much, but it certainly is an eyesore.</li>
      <li>you just won&#x27;t believe how much help this is.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t really know you need something like this until you used it--</li>
      <li>But once you get the knack it really works.</li>
      <li>The arm is very rigid and does not allow for repositioning the dryer.</li>
      <li>I really cant hold my blow dryer up anymore.</li>
      <li>makes mornings so much easier and quicker.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Blo &amp; Go for over a year and just realized how much time this product has saved each day...</li>
      <li>It took up too much room to just leave it.  </li>
      <li>&quot; products are often very \\&quot;gimicky\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>It still holds very well, though, once in place.</li>
      <li>Does stick very well to my vanity in the bathroom (glass/marble).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this product almost 3 years ago.  It is so nice to be hands free and feel confident it will stick to the counter (or glass).  I recently bought it as a gift for my mom.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Very useful item if it would stay up.  we followed directions and cleaned the glass surface before putting up  the item itself is very heavy and sturdy.   I just dont think the suction is enough to hold up a blow dryer.  Really wish they made something like this that is a sturdy stand that will not fall over easily.</li>
    <li> I bought one as a gift for my wife. I&#x27;ll never need to hold the hair dryer for her again! Works as expected.</li>
    <li> Absoultely love this product. Would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I really hate blow drying my hair.  I saw it on late night TV, but didn&#x27;t order it immediately.  I kept thinking about it and finally ordered it two weeks later.  I like it so much more than I thought I would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it&#x27;s suctioned onto the mirror, it isn&#x27;t going anywhere.  I reposition it several times while drying and it feels very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one infomercial item that delivers.</li>
    <li> Still can&#x27;t get a handle on this product............can&#x27;t seem to get it to hold standing position on a counter top...............holds great on a mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I have a disability that limits the use of one of my arms.  I really liked it when I first got it.  Like someone else said, it&#x27;s not the prettiest thing in the world.  It is bulky and a bit heavy.  All of those things aside it worked great with my small sized blow dryer.  A bigger dryer would definitely not work. I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now and it won&#x27;t stay on the mirror or any other flat surface any more.  It loses suction about 10 minutes after I attach it.  Because of the weight of the item, when it falls down it makes a horrible noise and breaks anything that is under it.  I thought about buying another one, but I think I&#x27;ll look into another type of stand.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I was having surgery on my right arm and right hand.  I am right handed.  Although the basics of this product is good, I have found it to be not as good as I was hoping.  After receiving it, getting it on the mirror is very hard.  It constantly falls off.  Thank goodness nothing expensive underneath it broke. I read other reviews and they too have commented it will fall off.  You have to take it down daily and re put it up.  Not good when you are one handed.  It only fits certain hair dryers.  I have found if you push up at the same time you are trying to suction cup it to the mirror it will stick better, but not long enough to leave for extended period of time. It is nice though to be able to have hands free.</li>
    <li> It was given for a gift. They told me they like it, but it falls off the mirror very easily.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. It is so heavy when I suction cupped it to my mirror, I thought my door to my medicine cabinet (where my mirror is located) was going to break off its hinges. Then, it falls off when I try to put my hair dryer in it. My dryer fell in the sink and broke. It also does not fit my Vidal Sassoon flat hair dryer. The arm is very rigid and does not allow for repositioning the dryer. Last, it is very hard to store as it is so big and bulky. Not using it anymore. TOO INCONVENIENT!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend after seeing it advertised on tv.  It sticks well to the mirror but there is a problem with the adjustable arm.  According to my girlfriend, her hair dryer is too heavy and pulls the arm down.  I told her to get a smaller hair dryer.  That didn&#x27;t go over well.</li>
    <li> I have a calcium deposit in my right shoulder and am right handed. I really cant hold my blow dryer up anymore. I also am sick of holding it while styling with a brush with my other hand...!!  Its a pain, no pun intended. I bought the Blo &amp; Go and I cant say enough as to how easy and convenient it has been for me. It took a few approaches with getting it on the mirror at first. You have to really push forward with a good amount of pressure on the suction area and then with the other hand press down the lever. But once you get the knack it really works. I have had it up on my mirror for a year. I just stand under it, turn it on and style or dry. You don&#x27;t really know you need something like this until you used it--one of those products that every woman should have or great gift. I really do love it.</li>
    <li> I previouly gave this product 3 stars because you had to affix the heavy duty suction cup to a flat surface and it didn&#x27;t come with an alternate way to affix it to textured surfaces. I&#x27;ve been using the Blo &amp; Go for over a year and just realized how much time this product has saved each day...now, I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I have a bad neck and muscle spasm in my left trapizius so it&#x27;s difficult to lift my left arm. The blo and glo holds my hair dryer so I can use my right arm to style my hair. I only wish that it could be left up permantently on my mirror with my blow dryer in it, but it can&#x27;t. It has to be removed after each use or it will fall down on its own - it happened the first time I used it. I didn&#x27;t know I couldnt leave it up (even though the directions say to take it down after each use - I didn&#x27;t read that far - my bad). So, other than the hassle of taking it down each time I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe someone didn&#x27;t think of this sooner! Best product I have bought in a very long time. Love having two hand to manipulate my hair how I want it. I am very pleased with the strength of hold the suction cup has on my mirror, the whole thing feels very sturdy!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not working, never stay on the mirror. Falls down all the time in few hours, and it broke my large mirror last time. I hate it, and I am not going to use it.</li>
    <li> The concept was good.  I like the idea of hands free drying.  But... The engineering was bad.  Dispite the large suction cup it still fell off of my mirror.  So I stuck it to the sink.  It fell over and the dryer hit the 6 foot mirror over my sink.  Thought it was a gonner but turned out ok.  I still stick it on the sink but position it so that if it falls it will not damage anything in its path.  Maybe if I could attach it permanently to the wall!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, wasn&#x27;t sure because \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; products are often very \\&quot;gimicky\\&quot;... but she LOVES it. A few women I&#x27;ve told about the gift thought it was great too.  It&#x27;s bulky and heavy, but that&#x27;s a good sign that it&#x27;s built well and will last. The suction cup was large, but it has fallen down once. Because of it&#x27;s size and weight, attaching it and pulling it off the mirror every time you use it is not an option, but it&#x27;s a little scary leaving it up all the time. (tip, don&#x27;t put anything expensive underneath it). (better tip: thoroughly clean mirror and blo-and-go with alcohol before application.     I wish this came with an option to attach securly to wall with screws. The image shows it attached to a wall or a door, but I highly doubt it could do that... needs a completely clean flat surface like glass.    Other than that, I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this, but I am afraid to suction it onto my mirror because of the weight of it and my blowdryer, so I suctioned it to the door next to the vanity.  My hair is curly, so I turn it on while I am doing my makeup, it is far enough away to be diffused, but close enough to dry my hair especially now in the winter.  My only problem with it is that it has fallen down a couple of times, my fault for having stuck it to the door not the glass, (it is sturdy enough that it didn&#x27;t break hitting a stone floor) but I love this product and have been looking for something like it FOREVER!  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The Blo and Go was a birthday present for my wife and she loves it. She said that the neck could be a little more flexible. Other than that, she really enjoys being able to style her hair without having to hold the hair dryer.And if mama is happy, everybody is happy!</li>
    <li> This product arrived as described in the product information.  It is easy to use and has been a big help.  I have RA and have trouble holding the dryer up for long periods of time.  This took care of the problem.</li>
    <li> This item is a bit bulky, and certainly not a pretty addition to your bathroom, but it really does give me an \\&quot;extra hand\\&quot; when styling my hair. I like that I can either use two hands for styling, or set the dryer on a low, diffused setting to dry my hair while I&#x27;m putting on make-up. I&#x27;ve also used it in the laundry room for drying my dog after her bath, so that I can have both hands available. It&#x27;s easy to put up and take down to move from room to room for that purpose. Note: It MUST be attached to a non-porous surface such as a mirror (or the top of the washer or dryer in the case of the dog-drying). The large suction-cup base will not stay attached to a cabinet or wall. I do wish there was an option for attaching it permanently; I would consider ordering a second one so that I didn&#x27;t have to move it.</li>
    <li> This makes drying my hair so easy and fast. I forgot to pack it in my suitcase when I recently went out of town, and really missed having it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I my name is Yvonne about a year ago I was diagnosed with lymphedema in my hand so it was very hard for me to blow my hair (  not no more love this product!!</li>
    <li> It is a great product and has cut down the drying time from 30 mins to 12!</li>
    <li> It attachs to the mirror for only a wile and after it follows. It is heavy and hard to attach to the mirror. I supposed I could attach and live it there but doesnt work like this. It is big and hard to find a place to store it while you are not using.</li>
    <li> Fastens to mirror or counter easily with heavy duty leaver suction base.  Flexible neck is strong, stays in position. I will buy another as a gift.</li>
    <li> The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because it will not stick to my vanity which is made out of wood. It won’t hold in place after I place the blow dryer. Does stick very well to my vanity in the bathroom (glass/marble).</li>
    <li> I like it. It looks cool attached to my bathroom mirror.  I can round brush my hair much, much easier, leaving my coif full and shiny!</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful device for the working woman.  makes mornings so much easier and quicker.</li>
    <li> I have a very bad shoulder and can&#x27;t lift it above my head. This product means i can blow dry my hair again. Hooray!</li>
    <li> I have Fibromyalgia and have always struggles with styling my hair when it was longer because of the pain of holding a hairdryer for the amount of time needed to dry my very thick hair.  I usually gave up and then my hair would look like [...]. For a long time I solved this by just having short hair.    I purchased this about 5 months ago.  I love it.  I can style my chin length hair with a big barrel brush and not have to worry about any pain.  You do have to take it down after every use because it is otherwise just too heavy, but I knew this from the other reviews when I purchased it.    I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  My hair looks great! I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this, as I thought I was going to be having shoulder surgery.  I had a broken wrist some time back, and boy was it tough trying to dry my hair!  I have very long and thick, course hair.  I had seen a review that made me go ahead with this.  I tried it only once, just to get the feel of it.  It is a little tricky to put together.  I don&#x27;t remember which part, as I ended up having my \\&quot;guy\\&quot; do it.  I had had enough!  But he said...\\&quot;No problem\\&quot;...whatever, men....It seemed like it will work in a pinch for what I wanted it for, even though I no longer need the surgery...yeah!  But I do not think I will use it for anything else, just not for me.  If I need it to assist me to get the job done one handed, I will use it. It will go into storage until then though.  Also, I do have a very heavy dryer, and it did hold it with no problem.  You just have to get it in there right, and you will be OK.  I also had to have it on my sink to use, and then take it off when done.  It took up too much room to just leave it.  I have seen the one that \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; on mirror, but figure that one would have to come down also, and am way too paranoid to leave it  to faith that it won&#x27;t fall down.  Oh, by the way, I am 5&#x27;3\\&quot;, so, on my sink, it was OK for me.  If you are taller, you may need to sit down or put it on something more like a kitchen counter for your own comfort.  Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> First it doesn&#x27;t have to be mounted on wall it&#x27;s heavy enough to balance with hair dryer in it on a table top. I think they should fix it where you could screw it to the wall which with a drill bit you could do it yourself but it works for me on top of the table</li>
    <li> perfect! exactly what i had been looking for.  Just attach to window or mirror &amp; it holds the blow dryer perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am surprised but this really does work.  It is a bit difficult to attach to the mirror only because the suction is so strong but once it&#x27;s on the mirror it holds the dryer great.  The trick now is just putting your head in the right spot for the dryer to blow on it.  The holder will bend and move to where you want it, it just takes practice to get yourself used to moving your head and not your hand since the dryer isn&#x27;t in your hand now.  LOL  Over all, I like it.</li>
    <li> Spends most of it&#x27;s time in my drawer taking up space and collecting dust now.  It is definitely not analogous to having a third arm.</li>
    <li> I suffer from carpal tunnell syndrome.  I have had surgery but still have no strength for long periods of time.  Holding my hair dryer was really hard to do over a minute or two.  This product saved the day.  It is sturdy and accomodates my blowdryer really well even though it is a big one.  I would most certainly recomend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I checked out many Dryer Holders before purchasing this one and I&#x27;m so glad my assessment of the comments from others left me with the Blo and Go by Laurie Coleman - Portable Hair Dryer Holder.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is over joyed as she can now clean her teeth and dry her hair at the same time. I set it up as instructed which is very simple and it has not come of the mirror once in three weeks, I would say that if you do as we have and push the arm/dryer in an upright position after use to reduce and stress on the mirror suction you will not be disappointed. I do feel that the most ideal way of having it permanently setup would be if you had a tiled wall/ surround. We are so impressed with this product we are going to purchase one for my wife’s Mother as she has problems holding her arms up to dry her hair. I would recommend this to any woman and any guy who wants to win some brownie points with their other half lol</li>
    <li> came quick, work fine for about a week now won&#x27;t suction or stick to any thing. my grandson has arthrogryposis and it worked great for him but now it won&#x27;t, sad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my blo and go for a month now, after a recent accident left me severely handicapped this little item has saved my life when it comes to getting my hair dried. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough whether you got one or both hands you just won&#x27;t believe how much help this is.</li>
    <li> with one arm cut off due to and accident it does the job</li>
    <li> Hard to flex into position.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Blo &amp; Go for nearly two years and love it.  I have been looking for a second one that also can suction to a wall or mirror - and am disappointed this is unavailable at this time.  It&#x27;s been like that for awhile.  Please start selling these again or tell me where I can get one.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item while it was being sold at HSN almost a year ago.  I first attached it to the wall next to the mirror, but it wouldn&#x27;t stay up.  I tried the mirror and that worked so I left it there, thinking it would stay until I took it down.  Not so!  It fell off after a couple of days.  I went through this routine a couple of more times, and the time between each fall got shorter and shorter.  Finally I just decided to put it up, use it, then take it down.  Since then I&#x27;ve had no trouble.  I notice that the rubber suction has come a little bit loose, after having used it so much, so it has to be turned all the way to the right or left before the suction will take.  It still holds very well, though, once in place.</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Put it on the bathroom mirror, adjusted it, it&#x27;s holding tight.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago. I attached it on my full body mirror overnight just to see if it will hold really good. FYI, I cleaned my mirror first as well as the suction cup of this thing before I put it on, just to make sure that it will stay really good... Sadly, in the middle of the night, it fell off and when i woke up to check it, a part of it was broken (meaning I cannot return it back anymore).  The other reviews are correct. The material that was used to build this product is already very heavy enough, how much more if you would put a hair dryer on it. For people who are wanting to buy this product, I would suggest that you put it on when you are gonna use it but detach it after use. Sounds like a lot of work but it is how it is. :)</li>
    <li> When you brake your arm or can&#x27;t use your  arm/hand and you only have one good hand! This is the best choice out there for you!</li>
    <li> Device is not functioning as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Portable Hair Dryer Holder&lt;br /&gt;For my mother, to help her disability,&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I find a &amp;#34;Holder&amp;#34; that does not hold&lt;br /&gt;And fell on my mother&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned the surface of the mirror in every form in order to make sure that this is not such a problem,&lt;br /&gt;I wet, the rubber surface of the holder,&lt;br /&gt;And also dried it&lt;br /&gt;But it turns out that nothing held him against the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I will summarize it in one word: disappointment!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely do not recommend purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Doron</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it really is hands-free, but it is quite a monstrosity! It took me awhile to find the correct height that I wanted it and the right bend, so I feel like I have to leave it up. Thank goodness it&#x27;s not in my way TOO much, but it certainly is an eyesore.</li>
    <li> the ads dont mention this, but it works real well for my wife who can only use 1 arm for this sort of activity.  I would have rated it a 5, but on occassion it comes off the mirror (maybe every 6 months or so).  hasnt broke anything yet, but keep that in mind---dont keep something expensive under it.</li>
    <li> very good quality product.</li>
    <li> It is hard to manage in a small bathroom.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t hold very long on the mirror.  It&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
    <li> I put this up as instructed but the suction just didn&#x27;t hold. Within 5 minutes it came crashing down. All I had been doing was testing to make sure it would hold so hadn&#x27;t even tried to use it with a hair dryer yet.</li>
    <li> Only sticks to glass or tile, i really wanted to like this unit, but i dont have a surface that worked</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Purchased due to shoulder injury and now post surgery.  I can blow dry hair while device securely holds blow dryer and can safely move it in any direction.</li>
    <li> It took me a minute to figure out which way to actually use the thing but now that I&#x27;ve got it I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This is truly an excellent thing to have for anyone who blow dries their hair.  I hate holding my arms above my head for prolonged periods and found this by searching for a product to hold my hair dryer. My one complaint is that the lever that snaps closed when you attach the suction cup...it snapped in half on the second time of use. It seems the shape of the lever makes it weak in the middle - poor design on that part of it. I am still able to attach it however by using a washcloth to hold the jagged edge when clamping the lever down. Other than that, the product is nice looking and functionally excellent.</li>
    <li> Too big and heavy.  Needs to be permanently mounted in order to be truly useful.</li>
    <li> My wife has M/S and she has difficulty holding the hair dryer. I was skeptical of this product working because it is one of those As seen on TV products. Boy, was I surprised. Out of the box, on the mirror, connected the hair dryer and hands free drying. We happened to have a full size mirror above the bathroom sink. Since the blo and go is a little heavy, I don&#x27;t think it would work well on a small mirror of a medicine cabinet.</li>
