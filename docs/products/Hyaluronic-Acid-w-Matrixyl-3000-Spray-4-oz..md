### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product recommended by my doctor.</li>
      <li>but it was awesome stuff</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also perfect for after peels when you want to neutralize the stinging on your face.</li>
      <li>Best of all I do not break out with it!!!</li>
      <li>It smells awesome</li>
      <li>and it has changed my sensible skin, loved it!</li>
      <li>This product is great and you spray it on, which helps to avoid contamination.  </li>
      <li>Great for post exfoliating/microderm abrasions.</li>
      <li>This is probably one of the many reasons Korean women have flawless and envied skin.</li>
      <li>So this is a perfect refreshing spray, particularly good for traveling in the tropics in the winter or at home in the summer.  </li>
      <li>A GOOD PRODUCT,</li>
      <li>and I loved the way it smelled.</li>
      <li>Yes, the product does smell good, but that&#x27;s not it&#x27;s intention.  </li>
      <li>Feels good on the skin.</li>
      <li>, acne prone, fair skin.</li>
      <li>This is a really perfect and convenient spray for the face and it feels really cool after a peel.</li>
      <li>Give it a try as I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
      <li>and it seems to be a nice moisturizer with a good cucumber smell.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>watery, refreshing,light  would be nice in the summer for acne or sensitve skin.  </li>
      <li>If someone can&#x27;t believe thier own eyes, well, what more can i say?</li>
      <li>It has a very light</li>
      <li>It is OK, refreshing spray, remember to close your eyes and aim at your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again.</li>
      <li>So when I buy a product more than once, that&#x27;s saying A LOT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this refreshing spray.  </li>
      <li>I thought I had just found a nice moisturizing cream, but when I ran out of this and was using my cream alone, there was a HUGE difference in my skin...</li>
      <li>Mostly on my face but can be used anywhere on your skin.</li>
      <li>I suspect it&#x27;s mostly water.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s okay, and I&#x27;ll finish the bottle.</li>
      <li>Love It.</li>
      <li>and this does not seem to bother it at all :)</li>
      <li>I never use hyaluronic products without putting moisturizer on top.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and will reorder.</li>
      <li>, many who claim won&#x27;t cause breakouts do.</li>
      <li>I just wish for sure</li>
      <li>MAKES BETTER.</li>
      <li>and when I&#x27;m using the product I feel my skin looks more supple.  </li>
      <li>It sprays onto the face a nice shot of cool moisture.</li>
      <li>Excellent for dry winter months with the hyaluronic addition.</li>
      <li>So for those instances, this (a watery spray) is a nice quick refresher.</li>
      <li>This product is almost deceptively light for how potent &amp; hydrating it is.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to pay tens of hundreds or hundreds of dollars to get products that really work!</li>
      <li>It is nice, and does a decent job as a toner for making serums more spreadable.</li>
      <li>The face needs moisture, an excellent way to add that little benefit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product used this way.</li>
      <li>On YT I watch allot of videos on Korean beauty and how it&#x27;s important to have a spray moisturizer in your purse at all times.</li>
      <li>It is a fresh cucumber scent which is really refreshing after a stingy peel.</li>
      <li>This product is worth the price and more so</li>
      <li>It has a light gel texture.</li>
      <li>I reccommend this natural cooling good for your skin toner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 65 years old and just love hearing compliments again!</li>
      <li>It is cool and smells like cucumbers.  </li>
      <li>LOL I&#x27;m so excited due to the fact I have missed out on great products over the years due to my skin rejecting it.</li>
      <li>: I have to say I am no longer really happy with this product because I also am experiencing extreme dryness after the product dries.</li>
      <li>The product was delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>Very nice spray after toner , before putting serums during the day, and face creams at night, it really sets and makes these products work better, using much less!</li>
      <li>It can be very nice and refreshing, especially in the summer, in a dry hotel room, or in a stuffy airplane.</li>
      <li>i really think its played a huge roll in lighting my lines on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Great product with hyaluronic acid, have ben using it for a few weeks</li>
      <li>LIKE THIS PRODUCT LEAVES FRESH FACE, a skin LOSANA, prepares for makeup, creams to get,&lt;br</li>
      <li>smell it did not make me feel refreshed, had orderd it before and loved it, but now the second time around it is to much.</li>
      <li>This spray is cooling and smelling of fresh cucumbers.</li>
      <li>Always set my fresh make-up with it and use during the day.</li>
      <li>There are many other formulas with these ingredients which are cream or liquid and easier to use and feel better.</li>
      <li>, it is unavailable right now.</li>
      <li>This product was just right for my face.</li>
      <li>It is naturally light and naturally non-oily.  </li>
      <li>I use this on top of my regular toner and to set my make-up sometimes.  </li>
      <li>I love cucumbers, BUT this spray has such intense cucumber ?</li>
      <li>I really enjoy it right after i wash and dry my face or right after a shave.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Easy to use, just spray it and wait until obsorbs (only a minute or so</li>
      <li>I use pure hyaluronic acid on my face quite often.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(I just bought the Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum</li>
      <li>I wanted something with hyaluronic acid for intense moisturization.  </li>
      <li>You look so much better!&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>This product really works well.</li>
      <li>In fact it really is helping to take the sting out of this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks Timeless.</li>
      <li>Maybe the matrixyl, which can firm (and kind of stiffen), undid the hyaluronic acid&#x27;s moisture</li>
      <li>I am also an aesthetician of 4 years and have used many different product thus far.  </li>
      <li>I did mix it many nights with my moisturizer, but even the nights I didn&#x27;t my face was soft the next morning</li>
      <li>But my favorite product of this type is pure hyaluronic acid, which can be used with make-up and/or moisturizer and other skin care treatments.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it has done anything for my complexion but love the smell and the feel of using it!</li>
      <li>and then use other porduct over top.</li>
      <li>I ordered this really hoping that it would live up to the promises on the bottle.</li>
      <li>The refreshing thing for me is with regular usage, i don&#x27;t have to just feel younger, but i am younger, because my skin says so.  </li>
      <li>Then your left with more scarrs or dark spots.</li>
      <li>gives my skin a soft feel.</li>
      <li>You need to follow with a moisturizer before this product completely dries on your face.</li>
      <li>it makes your skin so soft too..</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much this product was actually working until I ran out of it!</li>
      <li>I have been using the product for two weeks so far</li>
      <li>I have oily acne prone skin and have to pay more money than most as many cosmetics companies know we will pay a high price to avoid horrible cystic and other types of acne however</li>
      <li>Will go back to my nighttime Olay classic for softening the lines around my 61 yr old eyes.</li>
      <li>I find this when compare with other Vitamin C spray does not tighten my skin as much after 3 weeks regiment.</li>
      <li>The one strange aspect of my experience is that after spraying it on my face and waiting for it to dry, before applying lotion, it really tightens my pores and seems to dry me up at times.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have reordered several times. Feels good on the skin. Excellent for dry winter months with the hyaluronic addition. Prompt mailing.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance fades. NEED LARGER SIZES TO BUY!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, just spray it and wait until obsorbs (only a minute or so and then use other porduct over top.</li>
    <li> Love this refreshing spray.  I used it morning and evening after cleansing my face.  It is cool and smells like cucumbers.  It is now a staple in my daily facial regimen.</li>
    <li> Yes, the product does smell good, but that&#x27;s not it&#x27;s intention.  I it just a spray bottle of liquid that I don&#x27;t see any results from.  I contacted the seller as soon as I received the product because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to what I was ordering.  They never responded.</li>
    <li> This is a really perfect and convenient spray for the face and it feels really cool after a peel. It is a fresh cucumber scent which is really refreshing after a stingy peel. In fact it really is helping to take the sting out of this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I have to say I am no longer really happy with this product because I also am experiencing extreme dryness after the product dries. In fact I have to apply a moisturizer well before this dries so I no longer bother to use it.</li>
    <li> This product did&#x27;t break me out!! LOL I&#x27;m so excited due to the fact I have missed out on great products over the years due to my skin rejecting it. I have oily acne prone skin and have to pay more money than most as many cosmetics companies know we will pay a high price to avoid horrible cystic and other types of acne however, many who claim won&#x27;t cause breakouts do. Then your left with more scarrs or dark spots. This product really works well. Give it a try as I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
    <li> watery, refreshing,light  would be nice in the summer for acne or sensitve skin.  not really a moiturizer. i have aging(40), acne prone, fair skin. didnt make me break out did not really moisturise either i would buy it again for the summer. prefer just hyaluronic acid  ingredients: water, aloe, hyaloronic, glycerin,  calcium panthonate, palmitoyl, oligopeptide, cucumber extract, phenoxyethanol</li>
    <li> I never use hyaluronic products without putting moisturizer on top.  So this is a perfect refreshing spray, particularly good for traveling in the tropics in the winter or at home in the summer.  My daughter also loves this product.  I just wish for sure I knew the quality of the hyaluronic acid and matrixyl in the formula.</li>
    <li> i use this on my face and my arms and legs.. I have psoriasis and this seems to be helping them alot.. it is sort of drying but i add moisturizer after it has dried.. i really think its played a huge roll in lighting my lines on my forehead and around my eyes. it makes your skin so soft too.. i lov it</li>
    <li> Very nice spray after toner , before putting serums during the day, and face creams at night, it really sets and makes these products work better, using much less!</li>
    <li> I use this over a hyaluronic serum I purchased from the same company. It smells awesome gives my skin a soft feel. Best of all I do not break out with it!!! I have super sensitive skin and this does not seem to bother it at all :)</li>
    <li> I love this product! It sprays onto the face a nice shot of cool moisture. It&#x27;s also perfect for after peels when you want to neutralize the stinging on your face. I would consider this a moisturing toner, but not to be used as a moisturizer in and of itself. Once it dries fully, your skin will feel tight. It doesn&#x27;t leave an emollient on your face. You need to follow with a moisturizer before this product completely dries on your face. It&#x27;s a fantastic product used this way.</li>
    <li> This prodduct does not cause breakout or any discomfort. An inexpensive way to keep my skin moist during the day.</li>
    <li> This product was just right for my face. I did mix it many nights with my moisturizer, but even the nights I didn&#x27;t my face was soft the next morning and it helped with my breakouts. Hope I can order this again, it is unavailable right now.</li>
    <li> On YT I watch allot of videos on Korean beauty and how it&#x27;s important to have a spray moisturizer in your purse at all times. This is probably one of the many reasons Korean women have flawless and envied skin. I love this product and will reorder.</li>
    <li> I find this when compare with other Vitamin C spray does not tighten my skin as much after 3 weeks regiment.</li>
    <li> Excellent product recommended by my doctor. I have been using for a long time. Mostly on my face but can be used anywhere on your skin.</li>
    <li> The ingredients sell here for so much less! This is only one of the skin products I buy form Timeless</li>
    <li> I ordered this really hoping that it would live up to the promises on the bottle. Unfortunantly it did not and I spend a lot of $$ for a mediocre product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for two weeks so far and it seems to be a nice moisturizer with a good cucumber smell. The one strange aspect of my experience is that after spraying it on my face and waiting for it to dry, before applying lotion, it really tightens my pores and seems to dry me up at times. However, I am attributing this to the fact I am using some acne medication that has dried my skin out in the past.</li>
    <li> LIKE THIS PRODUCT LEAVES FRESH FACE, a skin LOSANA, prepares for makeup, creams to get,&lt;br /&gt;SKIN MAKES BETTER. A GOOD PRODUCT,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for approximately one month and I&#x27;ve had several friends comment &amp;#34;What are you doing?  You look so much better!&amp;#34;  I am using the Hyaluronic Acid spray and the Hyaluronic Acid eye cream.  I&#x27;m 65 years old and just love hearing compliments again!</li>
    <li> It is OK, refreshing spray, remember to close your eyes and aim at your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again. There are many other formulas with these ingredients which are cream or liquid and easier to use and feel better.</li>
    <li> This product is almost deceptively light for how potent &amp; hydrating it is.  I thought I had just found a nice moisturizing cream, but when I ran out of this and was using my cream alone, there was a HUGE difference in my skin...it became very dry and even my lips became a little flakey around the edges. I didn&#x27;t realize how much this product was actually working until I ran out of it! I mist on my face &amp; neck as soon as I get out of the shower and then put my moisturizing cream on over it. It has a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy just about every beauty product out there - So when I buy a product more than once, that&#x27;s saying A LOT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I just bought the Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum - I can&#x27;t wait to see how that works!)</li>
    <li> This spray is cooling and smelling of fresh cucumbers. I really enjoy it right after i wash and dry my face or right after a shave. The product was delivered quickly. I reccommend this natural cooling good for your skin toner.  Austin Elliott</li>
    <li> I use this as a base for other applications like rice bran scrubs and masks. It is nice, and does a decent job as a toner for making serums more spreadable.</li>
    <li> I use this on top of my regular toner and to set my make-up sometimes.  I always put a moisturizer over it.  I have dry skin and when I&#x27;m using the product I feel my skin looks more supple.  I am also an aesthetician of 4 years and have used many different product thus far.  I do like the benefits of having Matrixyl 3000 w/hylauronic acid and I believe it has made a difference in my skin tone when I am using it.  I just bought the eye cream and can&#x27;t wait to see how it does too.  It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to pay tens of hundreds or hundreds of dollars to get products that really work!</li>
    <li> But wish it were a bit less expensive. Not sure if it has done anything for my complexion but love the smell and the feel of using it!</li>
    <li> I wanted something with hyaluronic acid for intense moisturization.  Will go back to my nighttime Olay classic for softening the lines around my 61 yr old eyes. Maybe the matrixyl, which can firm (and kind of stiffen), undid the hyaluronic acid&#x27;s moisture</li>
    <li> This product is great and you spray it on, which helps to avoid contamination.  It is naturally light and naturally non-oily.  Based on my usage, i anticipate one bottle to last for at least 45 days, maybe 60.  It keeps my face, neck and hands moist and it minimizes lines and wrinkles.  It doesn&#x27;t just tighten my skin, but it also tones my skin, i know this because i used to have a few bumps that were probably associated with me trying different things to keep my complexion moist and at the same time balanced all over, and by this i mean to say not oily or too dry, and the few bumps were down overnight and by midday i had to see if i could find them, by the next morning i remembered where they were, of course, but i could even find them or feel them, but i also try to drink water throughout the day, but i don&#x27;t always remember.  The refreshing thing for me is with regular usage, i don&#x27;t have to just feel younger, but i am younger, because my skin says so.  If someone can&#x27;t believe thier own eyes, well, what more can i say?</li>
    <li> I knew this was a liquid spray when I bought it. What I realized when using it is that I don&#x27;t like watery sprays for daily use.  I use pure hyaluronic acid on my face quite often. It has a light gel texture. This product is like spraying Evian water on your face. If you&#x27;ve ever used those mineral water sprays for your face (Evian or Avene), you know what I mean. It can be very nice and refreshing, especially in the summer, in a dry hotel room, or in a stuffy airplane. I have some relatives who crank the heat in their homes in the winter. I also get dried out from the heater in a car blasting at me. So for those instances, this (a watery spray) is a nice quick refresher. But I&#x27;m not sure how much of a real moisturizer or anti-aging skin care product it is. I&#x27;d like to know the percentage of water to the percentage of hyaluronic acid and Matrixyl 3000. I suspect it&#x27;s mostly water. I think it&#x27;s okay, and I&#x27;ll finish the bottle. But my favorite product of this type is pure hyaluronic acid, which can be used with make-up and/or moisturizer and other skin care treatments.</li>
    <li> Works,it is  a lot cheaper the Trilane that I had use before. Will be buying from again. This product is worth the price and more so</li>
    <li> Great product with hyaluronic acid, have ben using it for a few weeks and it has changed my sensible skin, loved it!</li>
    <li> I love cucumbers, BUT this spray has such intense cucumber ? smell it did not make me feel refreshed, had orderd it before and loved it, but now the second time around it is to much.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this anymore but it was awesome stuff and I loved the way it smelled. Great for post exfoliating/microderm abrasions.</li>
    <li> Will not live without Timeless HA Spray with Matrixyl 3000 plus Cucumber Extract. Use it before applying moisture day and night. Always set my fresh make-up with it and use during the day. Will not leave home without it. Winter is coming. The face needs moisture, an excellent way to add that little benefit. Love It. Thanks Timeless.</li>
