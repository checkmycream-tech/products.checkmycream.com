### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They hold the perfect amount of hair in place all day, never pulling, and never need to be readjusted.</li>
      <li>Very good.</li>
      <li>GOOD LUCK!</li>
      <li>I was so happy that I found these (a 2-pack too) on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t know how happy I was .</li>
      <li>They got here so quickly, it was wonderful!</li>
      <li>and I would never be able to find them again!</li>
      <li>nothing else will do.&lt;br /&gt;Those of us who love them, love them because they are 3 inches...</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere and am so glad to have a stash of them again.</li>
      <li>used two of these barrettes on either side&lt;br /&gt;I would not be able to use one for &amp;#34;pony tail&amp;#34; as pictured on the package&lt;br</li>
      <li>stil holds better than any newer styles.</li>
      <li>Need more colors.</li>
      <li>and so does the mock tort top.</li>
      <li>i am glad i did find them, however</li>
      <li>I have used these barrettes my whole life (60+), and was so happy to see I could purchase them online since I can no longer find them in stores.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are the best barrette I have used in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have always been able to depend on this companies quality and again they have not disappointed me.</li>
      <li>So, thanks, Amazon and Goody, for sending me not one but two packs of hair magic!</li>
      <li>Well, don&#x27;t bother, they are cheap and the clasp that used to hold my fine medium hair</li>
      <li>I still like putting barrettes in my hair and they are available in stores in my area.</li>
      <li>love them so much I ordered more than one.</li>
      <li>, cannot find this product in stores, so was hoping this was a good same thing.</li>
      <li>True.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and just as pictured.</li>
      <li>They are so cheaply made out of cheap materials that they really can&#x27;t be used at all.  </li>
      <li>i like the old ones much better....</li>
      <li>Regular hair barrettes, we like them much better than the clip type.  </li>
      <li>My grand daughter took my last one</li>
      <li>I had the same name-brand barrettes of several years ago, and loved them.</li>
      <li>Thanks for still selling them.</li>
      <li>I had gotten these barrettes years ago in a store ( and I mean YEARS ago) and loved them...</li>
      <li>I took me a while to find these older style barrettes.</li>
      <li>Goody women&#x27;s classic, if it ever returns.</li>
      <li>Thank you for having these in stock, I bought two packs hopefully they will last like the last ones I bought if my grand daughters don&#x27;t take them.</li>
      <li>Laugh at me digging the 80s on a daily basis, but I</li>
      <li>If I get hot later, I can pull all of my hair up in the barrette.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;These barrettes definitely serve a certain purpose...</li>
      <li>They changed this product slightly from the original staytight barrettes of this style but they still work.</li>
      <li>I lost the last original barrette a few months ago and absolutely mourned.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t carry this &#x27;old-style&#x27; in the stores anymore, and I thought when I lost my last one from my old collection, I would never find that style again.</li>
      <li>exactly as I remember this clip from 30 years ago with one exception:  the metal is a little softer and malleable.  </li>
      <li>just the right size you can&#x27;t find in stores...longer than usual.</li>

<li> I have been looking for these for a long time.</li>
<li> I have been looking for these 3&amp;#34; long barrettes for a long time.</li>
<li> i should have listened to the other reviews that say the same thing.  </li>
<li> Goody hard to find, old shool hair clips, holds my thick hair very well.</li>
<li> The metal on them bends alittle easier than on other barrettes.</li>
<li> These are the ONLY barrettes that work for my thick curly hair.</li>
<li> hold all day and you don&#x27;t have to mess with them like you would a head</li>
<li> The barrette is long, and thin.</li>
<li> Meanwhile, I am returning these barrettes to Amazon because they are such an inferior product and at $10-plus for a package of two - four barrettes each - are useless and a waste of money for me.</li>
<li> Thank you, I&#x27;m sorry it cannot be found in  local stores anymore.</li>
<li> These are hard to find.</li>
<li> and I had a hard time trying to find them.</li>
<li> so well is now useless.</li>

    <li> Just as I hope they would be!! They got here so quickly, it was wonderful!</li>
    <li> I took me a while to find these older style barrettes. The metal on them bends alittle easier than on other barrettes. That&#x27;s why I like them. I have pretty thick hair and I can get all of my hair up in these like a pony tail holder. So I can leave the house with the front of my hair pulled back. If I get hot later, I can pull all of my hair up in the barrette. Works great. Thanks for still selling them.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these for a long time. My grand daughter took my last one and I had a hard time trying to find them. I finally looked on line and found them on Amazon.com. You don&#x27;t know how happy I was . I have used these Barrettes for over 30 years for my long hair as they are the only ones that seem to stay  when I put my hair up . Thank you for having these in stock, I bought two packs hopefully they will last like the last ones I bought if my grand daughters don&#x27;t take them.</li>
    <li> They changed this product slightly from the original staytight barrettes of this style but they still work. Have you ever tried to find these at a store? GOOD LUCK!</li>
    <li> The only barrette that holds all of my hair! Thank you, I&#x27;m sorry it cannot be found in  local stores anymore.</li>
    <li> they arent as snug as they used to be................i like the old ones much better.... i am glad i did find them, however</li>
    <li> These are the ONLY barrettes that work for my thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find. Regular hair barrettes, we like them much better than the clip type.  Need more colors.</li>
    <li> I was so happy that I found these (a 2-pack too) on Amazon.  I still like putting barrettes in my hair and they are available in stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I had gotten these barrettes years ago in a store ( and I mean YEARS ago) and loved them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as you know, barrettes get lost and sticky with hair spray and it becomes time to replenish.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen them (3 inch) in the stores in years and years.&lt;br /&gt;So when I finally found them on Amazon I was so excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have used these 3 inch barrettes to pull your hair back, nothing else will do.&lt;br /&gt;Those of us who love them, love them because they are 3 inches...&lt;br /&gt;They hold all day and you don&#x27;t have to mess with them like you would a head band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thickish hair:&lt;br /&gt;I used two of these barrettes on either side&lt;br /&gt;I would not be able to use one for &amp;#34;pony tail&amp;#34; as pictured on the package&lt;br /&gt;These are flat&lt;br /&gt;These barrettes definitely serve a certain purpose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered several packs of them for fear they would go away and I would never be able to find them again!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product online, and thought, How could a barrette name brand be such a dud? I had the same name-brand barrettes of several years ago, and loved them. True., cannot find this product in stores, so was hoping this was a good same thing. This product is inferior. It does not hold the hair - slips off. and so does the mock tort top. I would like to buy the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; Goody women&#x27;s classic, if it ever returns. Meanwhile, I am returning these barrettes to Amazon because they are such an inferior product and at $10-plus for a package of two - four barrettes each - are useless and a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> just the right size you can&#x27;t find in stores...longer than usual. Very good.</li>
    <li> I hunted every store in my neighborhood and could not find these.&lt;br /&gt;They are the best barrette I have used in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I love them so much I ordered more than one.</li>
    <li> exactly as I remember this clip from 30 years ago with one exception:  the metal is a little softer and malleable.  Still holds my hair but metal gives so it loosens a bit.  stil holds better than any newer styles.</li>
    <li> Goody hard to find, old shool hair clips, holds my thick hair very well. Durable, chick and beautifil. Will re-order</li>
    <li> Just right length for my thick, slippy hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and just as pictured. I have always been able to depend on this companies quality and again they have not disappointed me.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this style barrette for a long time and finally found it on Amazon.com...it is the only type that will hold my hair back securely as I have thin hair. The barrette is long, and thin.They don&#x27;t carry this &#x27;old-style&#x27; in the stores anymore, and I thought when I lost my last one from my old collection, I would never find that style again. Thank you, Amazon!! Also, the price could not be beat!</li>
    <li> Worthless.  These are so flimsy that they just bend instead of holding your hair.  i should have listened to the other reviews that say the same thing.  They are so cheaply made out of cheap materials that they really can&#x27;t be used at all.  i tried one and it bend out of shape and and completely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Call me a throwback. Laugh at me digging the 80s on a daily basis, but I *adore* these barrettes. They hold the perfect amount of hair in place all day, never pulling, and never need to be readjusted. I lost the last original barrette a few months ago and absolutely mourned. So, thanks, Amazon and Goody, for sending me not one but two packs of hair magic!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these 3&amp;#34; long barrettes for a long time. I used them way back in the 70&#x27;s and found one in a box of ceramics tools last year. I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere and am so glad to have a stash of them again.</li>
    <li> I have used these barrettes my whole life (60+), and was so happy to see I could purchase them online since I can no longer find them in stores. Well, don&#x27;t bother, they are cheap and the clasp that used to hold my fine medium hair so well is now useless. It bends out of shape and doesn&#x27;t hold anything. They are going in the trash. Shame on you Goody!!!</li>
