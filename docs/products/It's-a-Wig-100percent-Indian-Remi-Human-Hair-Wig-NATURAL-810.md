      <li>Absolutely love this wig.</li>
      <li>I also learned how to brush the wig from the top to the bottom to minimize the tangling.</li>
      <li>My friend love mine</li>
      <li>really love it..will order more.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>But I am definately in love with this one</li>
      <li>and I simply love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it..</li>
      <li>This hair is so soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to style..</li>
      <li>The wig was nice but to much for me during this simmer weather.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the quality,  I love it because it looks like your natural relaxed african hair.</li>
      <li>I received the wig earlier than promised and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>But flat ironed or flexi rodded, it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
      <li>It came quickly as we&#x27;ll.  </li>
      <li>I was nervous about ordering online for my wigs as I wear them everyday but it worked out great.</li>
      <li>I love the color and it looks so natural.</li>
      <li>Love it, much better than what I expected</li>
      <li>I loved the first one so much that I ordered a second one.</li>
      <li>Good for costumes or African-American women, as it has the texture of relaxed Afro-Carribean hair (Each strand is slightly wavy from end to end)</li>
      <li>plus i did checked the wig and it was very cheap looking and totally frizzy.  </li>
      <li>It turned out ok, but not the same as when first purchased.  </li>
      <li>I will say the pic is a tiny bit deceiving, it does frame the face alomt more than in the pic</li>
      <li>Just beautiful natural looking african american relaxed hair.  </li>
      <li>Ready to order another one.</li>
      <li>It takes heat very well and holds a curl without product added to it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s bulky and the texture looks very unnatural.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really black,it does not curl and it does not look a bit real,keep your money</li>
      <li>but the way the bangs lay, you really don&#x27;t need one.  </li>
      <li>The wig gives a full look and I usually pull out some of my hair in front to make it look more natural.  </li>
      <li>The wig is very light weight and the hair looks just like my african american relaxed hair.</li>
      <li>It was much shorter and cut in an old woman&#x27;s style.  </li>
      <li>She liked the edgy style.</li>
      <li>I like the texture as I tell people this is reflective of real black people&#x27;s hair and not that super straight higher priced texture.  </li>
      <li>The only think I did to mine was cut off about two inches so that I could wear it in my military uniform without it touching my collar.  </li>
      <li>The wake is much shorter than the picture illustrates, however it is decent human hair quality.</li>
      <li>Felt very natural and looks natural as well.</li>
      <li>I did have it trimmed just a little to fit my face shape.</li>
      <li>looks so natural</li>
      <li>Is is lightweight and the hair is soft.</li>
      <li>Feels sooooo... natural and classy.</li>
      <li>3 full days later i got an email telling me it got charged and shipped, i wrote to the selled and gave a B.S. excuse to why my request was IGNORED, they they something like, whe processed the purshases inmediately (AGAIN B.S.)  </li>
      <li>The texture is like relaxed African American hair &amp; that makes look natural.</li>
      <li>My first wig in this style (color 1B) was purchased at my local BS store and it got a little tangled in the back.</li>
      <li>That being said, it is straight, and it can work with a little TLC.</li>

<li> That being said, it is straight, and it can work with a little TLC.</li>
<li> It flat irons well, and it will hold a curl pattern well.</li>
<li> It is not soft and sleek like in the photo, it&#x27;s almost frizzy.</li>
<li> Oh and it does shed when brushed but not a whole lot.</li>
<li> I in the process of trying to find other wigs with this same hair type.  </li>
<li> so I will see if that one tangles like the other one I purchased in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a human wig or not</li>
<li> ; what a waste of money; my wig doesn&#x27;t look at all like the wig online; it&#x27;s super thin on the sides and too long in the back; I hate human wigs with that krimple-look in the texture of the hair; I have synthetic wigs with the same krimple-look in the texture</li>
<li> ,it comes in jet black</li>
<li> By the way, i hate leaving poor reviews, but sometimes there&#x27;s just nothing good to say...</li>
<li> After 2 months of wear it started to look a little ragged</li>
<li> and the bang could have been a little longer like the picture I just don&#x27;t like it</li>
<li> i knew i wasted my money</li>
<li> It was too stiff thought it would be a little longer</li>
<li> so I guess I&#x27;ll cut the back shorter and try to style this ugly wig or throw it in the closet with the other collection of wigs.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit thick and the texture changes when washed.</li>
<li> Too thick.</li>
<li> No glossy, fake looking doll hair...</li>
<li> that&#x27;s how bad it looks,and it looks nothing like that pix</li>
<li> So they you go, terrible customer service and a poor quality product, that&#x27;s what you can expect from this seller.  </li>
<li> words cannot explain about how i fell about this piece of junk,it&#x27;s the worst wig i ever brought,when it came</li>
<li> This wig is awful.  </li>
<li> terrible product</li>

    <li> I recently got this wig  because  i wanted to rest my hair lIne from all the weaving and braiding. I am very happy with the quality,  I love it because it looks like your natural relaxed african hair. I give it five stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bulky and the texture looks very unnatural. It is not soft and sleek like in the photo, it&#x27;s almost frizzy. That being said, it is straight, and it can work with a little TLC. Good for costumes or African-American women, as it has the texture of relaxed Afro-Carribean hair (Each strand is slightly wavy from end to end)</li>
    <li> This hair is so soft and beautiful. Feels sooooo... natural and classy. I get lots of compliments with it. The texture is like relaxed African American hair &amp; that makes look natural. PPL think is my own hair. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my go to wig!!  I love it.  It not to bulky and it doesn&#x27;t look wiggy.  It doesn&#x27;t have part but the way the bangs lay, you really don&#x27;t need one.  It takes heat very well and holds a curl without product added to it.  The only think I did to mine was cut off about two inches so that I could wear it in my military uniform without it touching my collar.  I will say the pic is a tiny bit deceiving, it does frame the face alomt more than in the pic But I am definately in love with this one and I can tell you that i am not a wig person, I am more of a braids/track person but this one is it.  I in the process of trying to find other wigs with this same hair type.  Oh and it does shed when brushed but not a whole lot.</li>
    <li> You can honestly move the part anywhere and it still looks great. Hair feels nice and you can style with heat.</li>
    <li> The wig was nice but to much for me during this simmer weather. Too thick. Felt very natural and looks natural as well.</li>
    <li> This wig is awful.  It didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture.  It was much shorter and cut in an old woman&#x27;s style.  Do not buy this wig.</li>
    <li> I loved the first one so much that I ordered a second one. The wig is very light weight and the hair looks just like my african american relaxed hair. This has to be the perfect wig. No glossy, fake looking doll hair... Just beautiful natural looking african american relaxed hair.  I did have it trimmed just a little to fit my face shape. Beautiful!!!!! Looks like a $400 wig.</li>
    <li> words cannot explain about how i fell about this piece of junk,it&#x27;s the worst wig i ever brought,when it came and i opened it and tried it i knew i wasted my money,it comes in jet black but it&#x27;s really black,it does not curl and it does not look a bit real,keep your money u will thank me,i never wore mines that&#x27;s how bad it looks,and it looks nothing like that pix,that&#x27;s the one they should b selling</li>
    <li> It was too stiff thought it would be a little longer and the bang could have been a little longer like the picture I just don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Loved this wig for the most part. It&#x27;s a bit thick and the texture changes when washed. That&#x27;s the only con i have. But flat ironed or flexi rodded, it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
    <li> This product did not look like a wig. terrible product</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  I requested a cancellation of this purchase, wich it was ignored by the seller and 3 full days later i got an email telling me it got charged and shipped, i wrote to the selled and gave a B.S. excuse to why my request was IGNORED, they they something like, whe processed the purshases inmediately (AGAIN B.S.)  so i got STIFFED whit having to pay shipping twice (to send it back) plus i did checked the wig and it was very cheap looking and totally frizzy.  So they you go, terrible customer service and a poor quality product, that&#x27;s what you can expect from this seller.  By the way, i hate leaving poor reviews, but sometimes there&#x27;s just nothing good to say...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so done ordering wigs online; what a waste of money; my wig doesn&#x27;t look at all like the wig online; it&#x27;s super thin on the sides and too long in the back; I hate human wigs with that krimple-look in the texture of the hair; I have synthetic wigs with the same krimple-look in the texture so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a human wig or not; I guess I&#x27;m stuck with it since it&#x27;s not refundable so I guess I&#x27;ll cut the back shorter and try to style this ugly wig or throw it in the closet with the other collection of wigs.</li>
    <li> I have this wig in three different colors and I simply love it. My first wig in this style (color 1B) was purchased at my local BS store and it got a little tangled in the back. However, this wig in 1b/33 is simply marvelous. I love the color and it looks so natural. I also learned how to brush the wig from the top to the bottom to minimize the tangling. I do not experience any tangling with the color wigs. I also purchased another 1b so I will see if that one tangles like the other one I purchased in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is also the perfect length if you like should length hair with not too much hair on your neck.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter. It was the second. She liked the edgy style.Is is lightweight and the hair is soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it..really love it..will order more.  It&#x27;s so easy to style..looks so natural, I can&#x27;t say enough</li>
    <li> It was not cut the way it looks.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchased this wig.  Once from a beauty store and once from amazon.  I like the texture as I tell people this is reflective of real black people&#x27;s hair and not that super straight higher priced texture.  The wig gives a full look and I usually pull out some of my hair in front to make it look more natural.  I get constant compliments on \\&quot;my hair\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one con is washing it.  After 2 months of wear it started to look a little ragged so I went to a beauty school and paid 25 to get it washed and back into shape.  It turned out ok, but not the same as when first purchased.  It&#x27;s wearable, but doesn&#x27;t have that flow when you shake your head... no jermack bounce back here lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was good.  I received the wig earlier than promised and in good condition.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it, much better than what I expected</li>
    <li> The wake is much shorter than the picture illustrates, however it is decent human hair quality. It flat irons well, and it will hold a curl pattern well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this wig. I was nervous about ordering online for my wigs as I wear them everyday but it worked out great. The hair looks and feels wonderful and you CAN&#x27;T beat the price! I don&#x27;t thing I&#x27;ll be getting my wigs from anywhere else. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Great product the hair is a good quality. It is the best buy with hair on amazon I have done so far. It came quickly as we&#x27;ll.  would do it again. No shedding either</li>
    <li> Ready to order another one. My friend love mine so she is ordered from them also.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had found them sooner.</li>
