      <li>Fast Service!</li>
      <li>Worked very well!</li>
      <li>Vol Inc. sent me cheap Orajel imitation that did not even have the same chemical make up as the Orajel Ultra that I already own.</li>

    <li> This is the normal Orejel but I did notice it tastes a bit nastier than usual and has a funny, darker color.</li>
    <li> Vol Inc. sent me cheap Orajel imitation that did not even have the same chemical make up as the Orajel Ultra that I already own.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! You can never find canker sore meds in the stores. Thank god for amazon</li>
    <li> Great product. I burned the roof of my mouth really bad and there was a hole there. After using this for maybe 5 days, it healed and now I can eat comfortably again!</li>
    <li> Tastes nasty, but Orajel always has!  It helps when my dentures give me canker sores and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
    <li> Works great.Fast Service!</li>
    <li> Occasionally I get ulcers and this really help them heal a lot faster than they normally would. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Stings like hell, don&#x27;t bother. Get Tanac</li>
    <li> It certainly does work!  You can feel it!</li>
    <li> Bout to put neosporin on my mouth. I bit my lips and couldn&#x27;t bear the pain, I didn&#x27;t know what to buy and bout to put neosporin on my lips but now I have this amazing fast relieving tool. Thank you orajel!</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Finally some relief from these awful things</li>
    <li> Worked very well! Would recommend to anyone who has a canker sore.</li>
    <li> Burns when applies and is very runny... It&#x27;s hard to dry an area of the mouth and keep it dry for 90 seconds while this liquid dries on top of a sore.. Not the easiest to apply and the film doesn&#x27;t last that long.. Stick with the other types of Orajel since they do the job better..</li>
    <li> she&#x27;ll never know what hit her!</li>
    <li> the best product i&#x27;ve tried for mouth sore issues  (and I&#x27;ve tried several :)</li>
    <li> For some reason I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore. So glad I was able to find this on Amazon and at a reasonable price. I had a canker sore for a few days. Since I couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores, I tried medicated mouth rinses, Listerine rinse, and the other Orajel ointments, but this specific one was the only one that worked for me. Used this at bedtime and the canker sore was healing and I wasn&#x27;t in as much pain within 2 days. After applying the ointment, make sure to give it a few seconds to dry and form the hard film. This is the only Orajel product that works for me when I get canker sores.</li>
    <li> I have a chronic mouth sore condition and this is the only medicine that I&#x27;ve found that works.  I only use it at night and it takes a very small amount to be effective.  I love that it forms an airtight gel covering which lasts the whole night.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but it has become harder to find locally - I can always count on Amazon to stock these hard to find items.</li>
    <li> This thing really works to he,p with mouth sores. Only wish the effect was longer lasting</li>
    <li> I have used products like this for most of my life and i just recently found this Orajel ULTRA and it seems to relieve the pain of the Canker Sores i get, which i get frequently, better than most all other products i&#x27;ve tried. i&#x27;m going to stick with this one.</li>
    <li> Works but use as directed.  Let dry completely after applied.  I also changed the toothpaste to a organic brand and that&lt;br /&gt;also helped with the irritation to the area.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I thought</li>
    <li> I get canker sores a lot because of my anemia, and this product works! It stops the pain while its on there as a \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; thing, and after about two days of applying it twice a day (morning and night) the pain was gone completely, as opposed to aprox. a week with a salt water rinse and non-flouride toothpaste. Definately a must have for anyone who gets canker sores frequently.</li>
