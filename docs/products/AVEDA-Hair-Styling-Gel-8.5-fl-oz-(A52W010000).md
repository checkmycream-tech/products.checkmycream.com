      <li>This gel is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>The best gel for my super curly dark hair.</li>
      <li>It is strong but not sticky / thick a bit liquidy but works awesome.</li>
      <li>It make beautiful curls but leaves my hair too stiff, sticky and with white flakes.</li>
      <li>It has a good hold without it being sticky at application or hard when it dries.</li>
      <li>For my hair it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get the effect I want.</li>
      <li>This product has too much alcohol added, which is very drying to the hair</li>
      <li>Been using it since it came out, now hard to find but a great hair product for short hair.</li>
      <li>These products make my hair soft, silky,clean and manageable.  </li>
      <li>This product will dry your hair out if you use too much.  </li>
      <li>The consistency was different than i expected but I just have to figure out the right amount to use</li>
      <li>This product was very drying and did not hold my hair as expected.  </li>
      <li>; only good in Aveda salons and not online; too bad because just because I live in a rural area doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t use and qualify for the fine products Aveda manufactures.</li>
      <li>This stuff really holds your hair in place without making it look plastered down.</li>

<li> No need to reapply the second day just wet and comb.</li>
<li> I apply it after a shampoo and air dry my hair.</li>
<li> Hand through hair once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
<li> Put in wet hair and style.</li>
<li> The other Aveda products that have me hooked are the body oils.  </li>
<li> Helps with my everyday styling</li>
<li> Aveda products seem, and are, quite expensive but you get what you pay for and a small amount goes a long way so in the end the expense is minimal.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveda products for over 15 yrs and that tells a story itself.  These products make my hair soft, silky,clean and manageable.  I would definitely recommend the hair and body soap, the conditioners and body lotions.  The other Aveda products that have me hooked are the body oils.  Try a product once and you&#x27;ll be hooked!  Aveda products seem, and are, quite expensive but you get what you pay for and a small amount goes a long way so in the end the expense is minimal.  I only wish I could use their awards program; only good in Aveda salons and not online; too bad because just because I live in a rural area doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t use and qualify for the fine products Aveda manufactures.</li>
    <li> No, No, No!  This product was very drying and did not hold my hair as expected.  This product has too much alcohol added, which is very drying to the hair and I try to avoid as much as possible.  I will not purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Works well on my husband&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> I works very good. The consistency was different than i expected but I just have to figure out the right amount to use and i like it.</li>
    <li> This product works. It make beautiful curls but leaves my hair too stiff, sticky and with white flakes.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT HAVE USED FOR SHORT HAIR FOR SEVERAL YEARS VERY HAPPY</li>
    <li> Helps with my everyday styling</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now and I have very  short hair that is blonde.  This product will dry your hair out if you use too much.  For my hair it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get the effect I want.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I have never found a sculpting gel that is as good as Aveda Flax Seed Aloe Sculpting Gel.</li>
    <li> GREAT Sculpting Gel!  Right up there with the best of the best!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
