<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is light and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Alba moisturizer for about 3 years or so now and I am very happy with this product. I love the fact that it&#x27;s a light moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s clogging your pores. I am in my early forties and have lived with a mild form of acne my whole life. I was getting  worried that I had gone this long without using a moisturizer and knew that if I didn&#x27;t start that my skin would be in bad shape before long. For the last six years of my life I have been using a very well known acne treatment program that has cleared up my complexion beautifully. So I was worried about using a moisturizer as I was afraid it would clog my pores and make me break out. My sister actually recommend this product so I took a chance. I am so glad I did! No breakouts from this product and it works great. I apply this in the morning before my makeup and in the evening after washing my face before bed but during the winter month my  face gets very dry so I will apply this mid day on some areas of face that tend to get super dry. I would definitely recommend this product especially to anyone with the same concerns I had.</li>
    <li> I wanted a cheaper product similar to Peter Thomas either face cream because I couldn&#x27;t afford 49 bucks for an ounce .. This is good for the money but not at all what I was looking for- guess I have to pay 49 bucks</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot, including completely fragrance free/etc.) that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO, it smells lightly of hyacinth flowers, which is a major bonus.</li>
    <li> I am always nervous to try new moisturizers as my skin tends to breakout when I change.  However, my previous moisturizer, a Prescriptives product, is no longer available so I had no choice.  In my search for an oil-free product, I found this one.  It may be early, I&#x27;ve only used it two days, but I&#x27;ve already noticed a smoother texture to my skin and my normally huge pores are now almost invisible on my cheeks. I typically blot my oily face througout the day, but so far, have only had to do that a couple of times a day.  So far, I love this moisturizer.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the fragrance - it&#x27;s a little perfumy for my preference, but it&#x27;s unnoticable after about an hour.</li>
    <li> I really needed a light moisturizer to help my skin recover from the harsh anti-aging lotion I use and this product has been great. Light weight, healing, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out!  I also really like the sent.</li>
    <li> My skin is prone to Acne but gets a little dry as well. It works Great to hydrate without adding anything oily to my skin. Doesn&#x27;t break me out...absorbs fast too. It is very light weight. If you&#x27;re someone who has combination/oily skin it will work great for you. It also gives my face a healthy look when I wake up in the morning. If anyone has used the Proactive Green Tea Moisturizer-it&#x27;s kinda like that one except better.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, this moisturizer is very light - too light in fact, for me. It may be alright for the warmer, summer months, but it left my skin feeling stretched and dry quickly during the winter. Despite being so light and oil-free, something in this reacted poorly with my skin, leaving my chin dotted with blackheads. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before and it&#x27;s taken weeks to get my skin back to normal. If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would most likely continue using the moisturizer on days I didn&#x27;t need something heavier.    I love the fact that this company doesn&#x27;t use animal testing, so I&#x27;m not ready to give up on them just yet. This product however, isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer! It is perfect for my combination skin.  I get dry patches on my  face in some spots yet I have an oily T-zone. So, it seems any time I would find I good moisturizer that would make my skin hydrated and soft, It would give me zits within a few days as well. This makes my skin evenly soft and smooth with no break outs. I LOVE IT! I have even been using it on my hands too the past few days because the harsh winter weather has been taking its toll. It does a great job. I think I will be looking into using even more Alba products in the future if they all work as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Works great and cheaper then the store</li>
    <li> I love this. I&#x27;m 26 and my skin has changed... like everything else it seems! Ay yi yi.  I have always found it difficult to find good moisturizers for my combination skin, but this one does the trick! It smells great and is the perfect consistency - light and oil-free but doesn&#x27;t feel like other watery oil-free products I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s now a staple...yay! Skincare is always touchy.  Alba is a good line though. Don&#x27;t even get me started on their yummy chapstick haha. Maybe purchase in a store with a great return policy in case it doesn&#x27;t work for you. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I would purchase in store - purchased from a vendor on amazon and i was skeptical about the age  or ingredients of the product.  The box was faded and the product didn&#x27;t smell the same as usual. Not sure what was up, but I sent it back and passed on the deal.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  This order came without a box and the cream was not right, bad smell.  I think I got an old product, but opened it too late to return it.  I would certainly have returned it if I could.</li>
    <li> I got this particular brand as I am on restrictions on what cosmetic products I can use to ensure they do not contain oil, animal fats, parabens, etc.  I actually have not used this on my face but rather on my hands and arms as my skin was very dry with the subzero winter we have had recently.  The product works well and has a pleasant fragrance.  Typically fragrances are an irritant for my allergies but the scent is light enough not to be problematic.  I found it in my local grocery store; however, the two-pack I purchased online was a much better price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy. A straight guy. Who happens to appreciate quality personal hygiene products. Moisturizing my face is essential, I don&#x27;t like how it feels when it dries out a bit after being washed. This stuff is great: it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t oily, with a pleasant and subtle smell that&#x27;s suitable for both genders. The ladies who come by love it, too ;)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, smells  great, light and not thick. Don&#x27;t buy this if you like thick and creamy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the alba aloe and green tea moisturizer from this same seller before and have always received them in their boxes as it appears in the picture.  This time both containers were wrapped together in some type of shrink wrap with no boxes.  I thought nothing of it but thought that the first jar I opened smelled a little off.  I decided to open the second jar today and it was very discolored and smelled awful.  They definitely sent me a returned product that was very old.  I&#x27;m going to try and return it but might be s.o.l since they didn&#x27;t send them in a box to begin with.  Be wary before ordering from this seller.</li>
    <li> I noticed there were no reviews from guys, which is unfortunate.  We men are stupidly told to use harsh soaps and alcohol-based aftershave...or be too effeminate.  A college friend insisted I try her lotion.  Within a week of of use, my face was clearer, less oily, and had less redness. My skin was much less angry about my attempts to stupidly dry it out! This works great for me with my dry skin but somewhat oily nose - the Alba is not oily but easily absorped and soothing (Some said it doesn&#x27;t absorp?! I have to put normal lotion on my hands first or my hands soak all of this up!).  I used cheap Nivea for men for a while, which is a bit greasy, and the expensive Art of Shaving process, which was alright.  I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair so after shaving I needed something calming.  I shave with Avalon Organic&#x27;s lavender stuff, and I use this to calm any leftover discomfort.  It doesn&#x27;t smell a lot, which I like since people often smell like a chemical factory and when I rarely use cologne this doesn&#x27;t interfere.   Ultimately, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this is a fine pick for men, too.  I took off one star because we men don&#x27;t get why abundant things like aloe and green tea cost so much.  Parents, girlfriends, and wives should encourage boys and men to try some lotion.  This is a great product to recommend. 2016 Update--I was buying as I have for 10 years and am surprised this review was here. I still love it, despite all the new brands for men.  I&#x27;ve tried Lather&#x27;s light moisturizer (too insubstantial and expensive), some Jack Black and Every Man Jack oil and non-oil based creams (all pricy and a bit heavy), gf&#x27;s $80 creams (with gold I guess), etc. The only changes I&#x27;ve made are that I shave with Jack Black&#x27;s triple comfort stuff--the best I&#x27;ve ever tried for my N. European skin with Sicilian hair (also tried EOS, which was good); I use often use a light sunscreen over this (Olay SPF15 or Alba&#x27;s Very Emollient SPF30 when I bike, but I personally see little difference in non-oil sunscreens); and I sheepishly admit that, for sunny vacations, I use Dr. Gross alpha beta pads to tan so I&#x27;m not tempted to zap myself!  I&#x27;ve convinced several friends, including one with psoriasis, to try this, and most have liked it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use it at night since there is no SPF. I love the container as you can get every little bit out.  I found it at [...] for $9.99, free shipping and no tax.  A lot of other places have this for $18.99.  This price ($26.95)is rediculous.</li>
    <li> I have combination acne-prone skin. Almost anything will make me break out, but I haven&#x27;t gotten one new pimple since I started using this moisturizer.    It&#x27;s dense, yet, when I smooth it onto my face, it&#x27;s very light and creamy. It also absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling perfect: Not oily and greasy or tight and dry.     This is extremely important, since I use a cleanser and toner that contain Sacylic Acid.    My face is also looking a lot better. I usually have larger pores around my nose, since that tends to be the oiliest part of my face. After about a week&#x27;s use, the size of my large pores has diminished drastically! My skin looks smoother, healthier and now has a slight healthy glow.    This is awesome stuff! The only reason I took off a star was because of the price. Stuff&#x27;s pretty expensive, but very worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few criticisms that this product is too light. This is oil-free moisturizer. For people with oily skin, this product is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for years because I don&#x27;t like to leave my skin stripped of all moisture when I use tea-tree spot treatment pads or harsh prescription acne medications. I use this in the morning, and 99% aloe vera at night. My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, and the product doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Finally! A face lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking and feeling greasy! Nice scent, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I love their line of lip balm.  I wanted to try something new and bought this.  Well, I&#x27;m not fully satisfied nor disappointed in the product, as it does absorb well, but the scent is too strong to my liking for a facial moisturizer.  My eyes are sensitive, so any strong scents near it will just cause it irritation.  Although I won&#x27;t be using it for my face after the initial application, I&#x27;ve found better use for it for my hands.  I like the Alba line, but this moisturizer isn&#x27;t something I can use on my face.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream ever! Non greasy and light feeling! And got it for a great price! Thank you...</li>
    <li> recently started a weight loss program that restricted oils for a period of time.  This is oil free and is a great moisturizer</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! I have very sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to allergies to harsh chemicals as well as breakouts. This moisturizer has never given me any problems. It has a very pleasant smell and texture, and has made me skin smooth and even toned. It absorbs quickly and wears well under make up or sunscreen.     I&#x27;ve tried lots of moisturizers from brands like Neutrogena, Clinique and Aveeno and this has been the best so far.  This is a great, simple moisturizer that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> da wife LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVVES IT, so I do too, since I got it for her.and I would do ANYTHING for HER.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin but the oily parts would always get really oily by the middle of my day. BUT since using this moisturizer after I washed my face (morning and night), my skin actually lasts through the entire day without all the oiliness! The fact that the product is oil-free really helps with that. It&#x27;s also a great moisturizer for any season, it&#x27;s the perfect consistency, it&#x27;s not too heavy for summer but it&#x27;s also perfectly moisturizing in the winter. If you feel like it&#x27;s too heavy in the summer, just use a little less, it spreads very nicely. It is also a great daytime AND nighttime moisturizer. This has been the only moisturizer that has been able to curb my oiliness...and I&#x27;ve been through many expensive brands (so glad I don&#x27;t have to pay premium price for moisturizer anymore!)     I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using alba products for over a year now. I originally started using alba when I got some weird rash around my mouth. I had to switch my normal facial products to something with no harsh chemicals. The only product I found was alba. No more rashes either. I really like this face lotion because it doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy. It&#x27;s perfect in my opinion and what a great deal. Two jars for 16!  You will pay 14 for one jar at your local store. I would recommend! And shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for at least 4 years now and it is hands down the best ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and what was sent me is NOT Alba Botanica&#x27;s Aloe &amp; Green Tea Oil Free Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the product was in no way factory sealed.  The REAL product is pure white.  This product was pink and smelled nothing like the REAL Alba Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used it, you probably wouldn&#x27;t think a thing but having been a long time user it disgusts me to think that they&#x27;d package it as something it clearly is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere!!  Pay a little more and get the REAL Alba!</li>
    <li> Fantastic face cream! I have issues with acne due to some medical issues, and this lotion is the only lotion that I have used that helps control my acne. Since using this lotion, I have been able to stop using my prescribed acne medication (which is 3 different types of lotion and a capsule) and only utilize this. I absolutely love it. My face feels clean, and isn&#x27;t oily after using this.</li>
    <li> Best face lotion! Using for years. Best price yet! Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Smell is great yet subtle. Not greasy. Only have to use a small amount. Small jar lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Great, affordable moisturizer. Works well under makeup. Good for combination skin. I wear it every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product and thought the two-pack was a great deal. However, the item arrived damaged: the lid of one of the jars is cracked and the cream has oozed out. Neither jar was in the original box but was instead enclosed in after-market shrink-wrap. Significantly, both jars were packaged in a plastic mailer bag inside the box with the other items from my order. I am reluctant to use the other, intact jar because of the lack of original packaging -- who knows what&#x27;s in there? Finally, this item is not eligible for return -- something I did not know before I ordered -- so I&#x27;m out twenty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you order the two-pack, be advised that it might not come in the original packaging, and be wary of items not sold by Amazon directly.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes on smoothly and in a short while is absorbed into the skin. It is very light and creamy as long as its expiration date hasn&#x27;t passed in which case it gets very runny and starts to smell a little. It is oil-free so if you need to avoid oil based moisturizer this works and is actually recommended by naturopathic doctor. Perfect for under makeup. If there is a down side to this product it is that it doesn&#x27;t keep the area moisturized for very long. You might find you need to reapply it.</li>
    <li> This product saved my picky skin!!! I needed something that both moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t clog pores and was at a loss product sampling to find something that could face two clashing problems effectively.  This does both, Thankyou Alba!</li>
    <li> Product leaves my face feeling oily, works that night I put it on but heading to morning my face is dry again. I think the proactiv green tea moisturizer works better</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I don&#x27;t normally buy expensive face creams (really never) but this stuff is super! Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a nice fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Great smell, easily absorbed. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer for my combination skin.  Have never used a better product.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and have used it for years ordering the 2 pack in order to get a bit of a discount. I always paid no more than $20.99 for this 2 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following month I see the price has been hiked to $26.99! What is that about? I will order the single packs that are only $11 from now on and save over $4.</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to moisturizer for years. It&#x27;s not greasy and yet perfectly moisturizes my face with no toxic ingredients. Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product is manufactured by the Hain Celestial Group, which makes snacks, and they are headquartered in New York.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, companies that promote a misleading, Hawaiian image are robbing companies actually based in Hawaii, that used locally grown products, that are made by local Hawaiians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing remotely Hawaiian about this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now- probably about 2 yrs and I absolutely love it &amp; don&#x27;t want to use anything else.  Like other customers have stated it is terrific for oily/combination skin and is lightweight, making the skin look refreshed not greasy. While there are a few customers that dislike it b/c their skin didn&#x27;t react well to it, I think that will always be the case with any product b/c everyone of course is different, however for most people it will probably be a wonderful choice.  So I would definitely give it the benefit of the doubt if considering trying it, I&#x27;m so glad that I did!</li>
    <li> This has been my go to moisturizer for years, though it gets greasy faster if i put it on without a dash of hot water mixed in. This is perfect treatment for my combination sensitive skin to feel fresh and silky all day. And it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. Its on the heavy side so you don&#x27;t have to use much for it to leave your skin feeling moisturized. It also smells really good, and it has improved the look of my skin by a lot.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever! Do not waste money on products filled with yuk that break you out. This is heavenly, soothing, and smells good too.</li>
    <li> this product works great over my acne treatment products, the skin of my face feels  so much softer now, i use it in the mornings and before bed, gives me a nice glow, doesn&#x27;t clog the pores and smells so GOOD!</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for a long time. When i purchased the product from this seller you can tell that they remove the actual real product and feel it with something else!!!!!!!!! it is also the manufacturer fault since they dont have any safety seal on the products!!!!!! but this seller is not to be trusted</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s oil-free, this product moisturizes better than some of Alba&#x27;s regular face creams. The only drawback is that it does come up a little short in dry, cold weather.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 2-pack so I could have one at home and then one for traveling (I travel frequently for work). I use the product right after I shower so my face is nice and moisturized and it works great, smells great, and is never oily. The only downside is that I recently went on a trip and when I opened my carry-on bag there was lotion all throughout my toiletries bag, even though the top had been tightly closed. So I ended up losing half the product and putting the rest in another container. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have get breakouts VERY easily and in the fall &amp; winter get such bad dry skin on my chin it turns ORANGE and hurts very bad. For years I&#x27;ve dealt with the pain and embarrassment and SLATHERED the thickest most brand name creams on my chin and had no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a coupon for this product and decided to just buy it because it was almost free. I was pretty scared to try it because I didn&#x27;t want to add something to my daily regime that would revert me back to breaking out all the time. I was even going to give it away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep it and one week later, my orange painful dry skin was GONE!! It&#x27;s so light weight, feels great on my skin. I haven&#x27;t broken out ONCE from this product but best of all I have found a product that has helped me with such a concerning problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!!!!!</li>
    <li> regular purchase from amazon, good product and price</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dry facial skin for years and have tried many moisturizers.  Most of them either dont absorb, cause acne, or even worse, lead to further irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesnt cause any of those problems.  It is light, non-greasy, and absorbs into the skin within seconds.  After several years of continuous use, it has not caused any acne or inflammation.  It has also significantly reduced that tightness feeling on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, I would highly recommend that you at least try it to see how it works for your skin type.</li>
    <li> I have pretty oily T-zone but dry around my eyes and side of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;This product is oil free and feels very light, yet moisturize and soften my skin. I never felt sticky or greasy at all. Also because of the light texture, you only need a small amount to spread on the face and neck. I just need to put my fingertip lightly in the jar once. Never need to put it twice.&lt;br /&gt;Good for under the make up, too. I use mineral make up over this moisturizer, and just a facial soap takes care of cleaning up my face without using makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you are looking for something light, keeps your face hydrated and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I didn&#x27;t realize it was 2 for $13.  Had I seen this I would have been skeptical and likely would not have ordered.  Sure enough these products are defective.  One was not full and the box was sun damaged, the other looked okay but smelled wrong.  I won&#x27;t order from here again.</li>
    <li> the BEST, i use it over 13 years.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using this product for several years now and like that it is not heavily scented and does not make my skin break out.  It feels fresh when you apply it to your skin and not heavy or greasy.  And this two pack was a really great deal! Usually we pay this for one bottle.</li>
    <li> Mom loved it and used it up before I could use mine up. This is my summer nighttime moisturizer, as my skin gets way too dry in the harsh New England winters for this to be sufficient. Love the scent of it and how soft it makes my skin feel. I wish they made one similar with SPF, so that I could use it as my daytime lotion too!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used in for over 10 years. Bought a double pack and both of them smelled rancid and one was obviously half used. Will buy elsewhere next time.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, it is my absolute favorite moisturizer. If you have sensitive skin and would prefer to use natural products instead of copious amounts of chemicals and you would like soft skin without oily residue then this is for you! I also must say this is the very best price I have found 2nd order and will definitely be back for more.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It feels good going on the face and it smells equally as good. My skin is very sensitive and this moisturizer is perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love almost all Alba products, but this is my favorite. My skin is very picky about moisturizers. The aloe vera in this cream has a great (light) scent. I also feel the product isn&#x27;t too heavy and won&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily or shiny. I&#x27;ve used this cream even on facial or smaller sunburns. It was very soothing. It appears expensive however it lasts a long time and maintains the quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light and refreshing&lt;br /&gt;Gentle&lt;br /&gt;Great for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;No breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> this is my favorite moisturizer. i was looking for something lighter and more \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; the price did put me off at first, but in the end, i gave it a try and have been using it for about a year. i use this as a nighttime moisturizer, but it works great during the day (when it&#x27;s not sunny). green tea and aloe are really good for the skin. alba makes great products in general, but they can be a little on the pricey side. still, it&#x27;s worth it especially with the discounted price on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-light and cooling&lt;br /&gt;-goes on smooth and absorbs well&lt;br /&gt;-nice scent&lt;br /&gt;-great for skin. does not make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-no SPF, but not necessarily needed. i actually use the trader joe&#x27;s moisturizer with SPF during the day.&lt;br /&gt;-can feel a little greasy, but very minor. goes away after absorbed. doesn&#x27;t control oil, but i usually have a sheet or napkin for blotting during the day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My teenage daughters do too.  It isn&#x27;t too heavy or perfumey... just perfect.  It does a great job moisturizing while being light, airy and natural feeling.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I will use. Its just amazing. I love that there is no oil to clog my pores.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! Perfect balance of moisture without causing oiliness. I have combination skin and this works great. Also, the green reduces redness.</li>
    <li> We like this product a lot. Just the right blend to make it non greasy. My daughter loves it too</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for sensitive skin. I am slowly replacing all my more expensive skin care products with Alba. The moisturizer is great, and you only need a little (sign of good quality). My skin gets really dry in the winter and this is helping a lot.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily at all!</li>
    <li> Two of my teenagers suffer from acne and they love this moisturizer because it is light weight and does the job.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m a big skin person.  First, I&#x27;m more into the natural-ingredient products than the products with more chemical ingredients (i.e., Ponds).  Second, I have combination skin, whichis acne prone.  Moisturizer is a huge conundrum for me because oils in your pores can cause acne, and of course a moisturizer--while it may soften your skin--can cause blocked pores, which in turn causes acne.  Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Derma E Tea Tree Oil and Vitamin E Moisturizer: You can tell the tea tree oil is a prominent ingredient because the smel is so strong, but this produt is too oily.  My face looks oily after se--especially my forehead, and it feels oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Desert Essence Oil Free moisturizer: so \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; that after use, you feel like you never used anything at all.  My face, in fact, felt as dry as it did before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Raw Aloe Vera Plant: I buy the plant stem from a local store, cut it into pieces and squeeze the juice on my face at night.  I figured why buy products with watered down aloe when I can apply aloe directly on my skin?  Well, the smell is horrible and it&#x27;s really gooey.  It does dry but when you wash it off the next morning, you have to wash extra hard just to get the goo off.  A lot of time and energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Alba Botaica Sea Kelp Night Creme: good, but heavier and you feel like you&#x27;re wearing a cream on your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW FOR THE PRODUCT OF THE HOUR: Alba oil free moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Excellent.  The product is silky smooth.  After you put it on, your face feels moisturized, but if you run you index finger all around your face, you can&#x27;t feel the moisturizer.  So, at night, it doesn&#x27;t get on my pillow--like the other moisturizers--while still getting the job done.  My skin also looks good, but it doesn&#x27;t make your skin look oily.  It just looks \\&quot;non-dry\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I am oily and dehydrated skin. I used to use Clinique oil free gel for moisturizing. I purchased this because I saw it writes oil free and it&#x27;s cheaper than Clinique.&lt;br /&gt;I was belied. The description is truly deceiving. Just a very thin layer of this cream has almost smothered my face. I can feel that every pore was clogged and cannot breath. It is like a coat of grease. Wash it off minutes after applying this. Cannot bear this any more!&lt;br /&gt;Also there is wired order, like some wine or yoghurt , in a very unpleasant way,(like something decayed...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it becomes my body lotion... Still greasy but not that severe....</li>
    <li> This has been the best daily moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s wonderfully thin yet effective without leaving significant residues.</li>
    <li> While it smells very nice, it leaves my face greasy, and gets worse as the day goes on. I am looking for a moisturizer that will not leave my face greasy, sorry to say, I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> I decided to give Alba Botanica Aloe &amp; Green Tea moisturizer a try after years of using Olay products and after trying to switch to less toxic and more organic products. I am in my mid-thirties with a combination skin prone to breakouts from stress, dry/cold air or any wrong skin product. After almost reaching the end of the first container, I can now say that my skin has significantly improved in texture and firmness! I use this moisturizer both AM (under makeup) and PM, and spread it even around the eye area. I have been truly impressed so far - the skin feels incredibly soft, fresh and firm without looking oily, shiny or tight. Also, fewer bumps/breakouts than ever! I honestly cannot claim this cream smoothened the little lines around my eyes, but they have been much less visible after I started using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;While I have really grown to like this product and will purchase again, the downside is a strong fruity scent - fragrance is one of few remaining chemicals that prevents this product to be truly organic.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to sulfur, so it is a bid hard for me to find a lotion that I can use, let alone a good one, but this one fits the bill! It provides enough moisture without becoming greasy/oily. The only thing is to make sure to apply it very lightly (as it says on the package) or else it will become oily and potentially clog pores. Abide my the directions and it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Package arrived when expected. I love this moisturizer, not only because Alba doesn&#x27;t test on animals and is committed to simple, natural ingredients for your skin, but because this is an oil-free, easy to absorb, lightweight moisturizer that leaves a refreshing feeling to your skin. I feel my oily face is hydrated all year long, whether winter or summer, this is a great match for me! I&#x27;m 30 y.o. and like I said, I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as my facial moisturizer for the past 6 years, at least. It does a great job without ever leaving my face feeling greasy. It smells very pleasant, too. Highly reccomend it to anyone who hates having an oily feeling left on their face after applying moisturizer. It&#x27;s paraben-free, too! What more could you ask for?! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> This does the trick, but the alba jasmine face cream that&#x27;s not oil-free actually does a better job. This one tends to feel a light, though if you&#x27;re looking for an oil free moisturizer, this is the one to get. Also, of all the organic moisturizers out there, I&#x27;ve found that the Alba ones are the ONLY ones that actually work, at least in my experience.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;m vegetarian so it&#x27;s suitable for vegetarians and cruelty free consumers.  I&#x27;m 53 have been using this for years.  Great in the summer!  Feels good on arms and chest too!</li>
    <li> I like Alba Botanica Aloe &amp; Green Tea Oil Free Moisturizer because it smells fresh and is natural. It also refines my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have an extremely oily t-zone, I suffer from acne plus, I live in hot humid Florida. My medicated cleanser and toner (prescribed by my dermatologist) are very strong so my checks and sometimes eye area can get dry and irritated. This moisturizer is perfect. It is light enough not to make my t-zone oily but works great for my checks. In addition, the green tea in this product helps calm down irritation. This is my yin to my yang.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, I use it daily before bed and in the morning.  It is oil free, so your face does not feel all oily after you use it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff at a good price</li>
    <li> If anything deserves a negative star number, it is this! One star ONLY because one cannot post reviews on Amazon w/out selecting at least one star.  I didn&#x27;t hate this product (which is what Amazon says one star means). I am writing this review to let people know this is a POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PRODUCT, POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL SALE of salvaged goods that have been opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received this today.  The box containing the product (box that is shown in photo) is clearly beat up, had price tags removed, wasn&#x27;t sealed. So what you are getting is actually not a new product, but salvaged goods from Amazon 3rd party vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty products can be easily contaminated. This product came with no factory seal to guarantee it is tamper free/not contaminated (for all I know, it may have been a sample).  Last time I ordered this very same product from Amazon, it came new from factory w/the seal on the box. Not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really deceptive and unethical. Won&#x27;t be ordering beauty &amp; wellness products from Amazon anymore, because I can&#x27;t trust the safety of the products after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, just to emphasize the point: these are salvaged products that went out to a vendor/store, and are now being resold as new when they are in fact salvaged goods from an Amazon 3rd party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be checking to see how I can report this via links provided by Amazon, as it may be illegal as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REAL BUYER BEWARE on this one.</li>
    <li> Someone who really wants to have a nice oil free moisturizer I recommend this. The texture on your face should not be bad.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer it has no parabens.  The two containers for about 19 bucks was a great deal.  In the stores, one container can run as high as $15.  Update:  I stopped using this, since it has phenoxyethanol in it.</li>
    <li> I like how light and yet moisturizing this product is. It has lasted me over half a year which is great for such a small container. However, it has a strong smell and it burns my skin. Maybe that&#x27;s why it lasted so long...won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I recently started an HCG diet which recommends not using any oils on the body. I am 54 and was skeptical that an oil free moisturizer would be OK for my face, but this works great! This moisturizer has a light fresh fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and smooth, plus I trust Alba Botanica to use safe ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream I found that actually has green tea in it that doesn&#x27;t cost $50 an ounce. Green tea calms the Retin-A flakiness. This does that beautifully. My face feels fresh in the morning and looks great!</li>
