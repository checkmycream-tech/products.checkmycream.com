<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love my Obagi! Great Price! Fast Delivery!</li>
    <li> Love the toner, doesn&#x27;t try me out leaves my skin feeling soft and refresshed!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nu Derm system for several years and am constantly getting compliments on my skin.  I love the way my skin feels as well as how it looks.  People are always amazed when I tell them my age ( I will be 51 next month), they tell me I look like I am in my late 30&#x27; s or maybe 40.  I love what Obagi has done for my complexion.  I began using it for pigmentation from over exposure to the sun and it has decreased the appearance of sun damage and improved my skin overall.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I continue to use this.  It&#x27;s mild and makes my skin feel like it just belongs.  Not complete without it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> Seemed like the toner was not really Obagi toner in the bottle. It smells differently and is a different color. I have been using obagi for several years.</li>
    <li> This is the most gentle toner I have used and it is good for my skin.  My skin feels clean after using.</li>
    <li> Obagi products in general are great and work as indicated. This toner is just one of the steps in my routine when cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> Superfast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice, hydrating and calming. Redness after first time of applying reduced over night! Also it reduced one pimple - it was a red bump, but after applying this it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
    <li> This is the beat toner on the market, and I have been using it for over 5 years. It does not dry out the skin and it is great for acne prone skin. My teenage daughters and I use it twice a day. It is a great price on Amazon. This product was recommended by a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I use it as part of my Nu- derm Obagi regimen &amp; even when I stop using the Obagi as a facial cleanser &amp; toner. Great product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin overly dry.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and love the way it works.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi series products since my doctor recommended and would not switch.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi products for 8 years, and will never use anything else on my face. These products really work.</li>
    <li> Great product and transaction was 100%</li>
    <li> This is a great product for all types of skin . I have used this in conjunction with all of the Obaji products and I love it. It smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and helps with your skins Phbalance.</li>
    <li> Very nicely balanced. My skin really likes this product.</li>
    <li> This product soothes my skin and refines my pores without any irritation.  You don&#x27;t need to use alot, just enough to coat a square piece of cotton.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS TONER. IT&#x27;S MILD BUT DOES THE JOB!!! THIS WAS RECOMENDED TO ME BY A PLASTIC SURGEON!! USED IT EVER SINCE!!!</li>
    <li> I had a great experience, everything as promissed. The quality of the product and the service. I recommend it to all,</li>
    <li> I use this product after I cleanse with the Obagi cleanser.  The toner makes my face even cleaner and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I must really love this stuff to spend 27 dollars on a bottle of light blue liquid for the face.  But there&#x27;s something magical about it, and I really love it.  This is my 3rd large bottle.  They last me about 2 years each.  I love Obagi.</li>
    <li> I switched to Obagi after reading info on the product.  I did get the best price for the toner on amazon.  I&#x27;m just not happy with Obagi. I will add for the Obagi users out there that the product is exactly what the description states.</li>
    <li> I use Obagi Nu-Derm Toner that I purchase from the physician&#x27;s office daily. I decided to try puchasing on the internet to save a little money.  I bought both the toner and the Obagi Nu-Derm Foaming Cleanser at the same time.  After a poor experience with the cleanser ( burning sensation of face and irritation after first use- definitely counterfeit product), I returned the toner unopened.  If you want to try the product, I would recommend purchasing it from a trusted source.  It is a great product, though!</li>
    <li> Obagi is a good line, but you don&#x27;t necessarily have to have this toner.  It will serve it&#x27;s purpose, but once you are done with the treatment you don&#x27;t need to keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning and at night. I no longer have oily skin and my skin is simply more clear. I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner for a year plus and I really like it.  It is very gentle.  Not stripping.</li>
    <li> The Obagi Toner Step 2 is a great product! I have been using the Obagi skin care line for 8 years now and refuse to use anything else. This particular product leaves my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. It was an easy transaction and the shipping was fast with Prime benefit.</li>
    <li> I use the entire Obagi system and have for over 12 years.  My skin has very few wrinkles and turning 70 next year I can say my skin looks 10 years younger.</li>
    <li> I began using this after cleansing my face with Obagi gentle cleanser, to see if it would reduce the size of the pores on my face.  It DID!!  I am happy with the product and the results I get using both the cleanser and toner together.  If you have large pores and have tried other things, this combo really works.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> Product arrived the next day from LV to AZ!!!! INCREDIBLE…Great seller and since I already use obagi…no complaints! I have never been a fan of toners…but I can tell you that it makes a noticeable difference when I do use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi for about 3 years I&#x27;m 42 and the toner is refreshing and balance the Ph in my skin it&#x27;s also a great price for the product. I paid a lot more at my day spa for it. I use it day and night and makes my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for more than 10 years now and I love it!, can&#x27;t do without.. Need to have it all the time</li>
    <li> I already bought 2 and works great for my skin, I have a little oily skin and leaves you face no grassy very silky and smooth, i really recommend it I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got this product from my dermatologist, but the price on Amazon is much lower.  I&#x27;ve been using Obagi for 8 years and get compliments all the time on my skin.  I&#x27;m late 50&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Obagi toner as I ran out of the traveling kit one. This was great as it contains more and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out!</li>
    <li> Great toner , leaves skin refreshed &amp; removes leftover residue from makeup.</li>
    <li> I would purchase this product again. I love it! My skin feels refreshed and clean.  In addition, my pores have closed since using this.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, just as expected. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Just as described. It also arrived promptly after ordering. If you are looking at this product don&#x27;t get mislead by the price. Its the real deal.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this product. Leaves me with great soft clear glowy skin.</li>
    <li> Cannot go wrong with Obagi and this toner is the best!</li>
    <li> The toner works well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling stiff or dry or sticky. I use it with the other obagi products</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi products for years!  My skin is healthier than ever.  The Nu Derm Toner does not sting, does not have a strong fragrance, but works amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and I have great results  - love it - loved the price :-)</li>
    <li> Why i chose a 5 star rating? It is an excellent skin care product and i love the Obagi skin care line.</li>
    <li> I bought this toner to help me with melasma and to help brighten up my skin pigmentation, I have been using this product with the other five obagi products (1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the 6th being the spf 50) because for three year  I have been tryn every thing I can for melasma  it would help for a few but come back darker after a couple days or didnt work. So I got very concern and taught it maybe skin cancer or something else I made a doctors appointment with my doctor at kaiser and he said u r fine I see this a lot with hispanic or fair skin people you are going to be alright I am goin to recommend that u start using hydroquin 4 percent. So here I go to  the pharmacy thinking that they have it , and  its going to cost about ten dollars. They said you cannot buy this over the counter this is cosmetic product.  So I went to the cosmetis department see a dermatologist who the said to me you will need to buy the full obagi collect that cost ..., but this one that has the hydroquin 4 percent cost 89 dollars (obagi 3 clear) I said what, she said it is expensive , I said  I need my face clean so just sell me . Therefore i ended up buying obagi products one through to 6 have help me it took as little as two week to clear all the dark spot from both corner of my eyes that had me looking like a raccoon,  I never took picture go go out without makeup I feel that if I didnt have on enough make to cover the dark spot, that when people steared at me they wonder if I got in a fight. I felt embarrassed , my babies toldme one day mama u got a big booboo, I said baby this is the mark u girls gave when I concieve you two. So therefore I must say I will continue to buy obagi and use.</li>
    <li> Nice scent but the product was just ok.  I gave it 3 stars because although it didn&#x27;t break me out, I didn&#x27;t have any noticeable improvements to my skin.  I don&#x27;t want to bash the product but I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love love love Obagi products.  My sensitive skin has never looked better.  My skin is really soft.  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I love the Nu Derm Toner. It makes my face feel so fresh and I love using it after cleansing.</li>
    <li> This toner is specifically designed for the Nu Derm line. It is a very pleasant toner with a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years now. I can say that it really improved your skin. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it is hard to find. You make it so easy since I love Obagi! Also, the pricing you have available is great.</li>
    <li> Something wrong with this product. Doesn&#x27;t seem like the same thing I received before.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Nu Derm Gentle Cleanser, Toner, C Exfoliating Day Lotion and the Hydrate Moisturizer. I used these products for a week before I saw my aesthetician. She told me my skin looked REALLY great! I literally noticed a difference after the third use. I AM using the products together. Cleanse, tone and moisturize morning and night. I use the C exfol in morning before moisturizer. At night I use MBI Renewal Lotion PF before moisturizer. This combo is def doing work right now! Of course I had head of Obagi but never used it. Totally impressed. Skin is SUPER clear, dewy and toned.</li>
    <li> I have used Obagi for years. The toner is a great product. It does not sting and does good job rebalancing the skin and refreshing without drying the skin. My face always feels smooth and fresh.</li>
    <li> Very easy to compare pricing and make the best selection for your needs all the time thus far. thank you</li>
    <li> Really cleans off the residual makeup and dirt after the cleanser. Not at all harsh and no alcohol smell. Fantastic feeling after I use it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent when used with the rest of the Obagi skin care products.</li>
    <li> Obagi truly stands behind their name. The product works so well. I have been using Obagi for over 3 years and yet to find anything better.</li>
    <li> I have found Obagi a great product to keep my complexion in good shape. Purchasing on Amazon has allowed me to continue to purchase this great product for less than what is charged in my physician&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Using this product has kept my skin young looking and vanished visible wrinkles.  It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product have been using it for past 15 years...recommend it to all ladies and Gents out there! Yeah for having it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> the original obagi that i got from my dermatologist did the trick, this batch that i got from online doesn&#x27;t work as well as my original.  i will not buy again from online vendor. i will go to my dermatologist&#x27;s office to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face feeling balanced all day. Never too dry or oily. Noticeable difference in skin. Creates better foundation for applying make up.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nu Derm toner for years.  This is the best price for a great product which I use regularly.</li>
    <li> The Obagi toner is the best product of its type, it does all that it claims and more. I have been using it and other obagi products for approximately two years and see a remarkable difference in my face. This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> In all my 40 years, I&#x27;ve never been the bearer of beautiful skin, especially after the acne from my teenage years ravaged my skin. I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi Nu Derm system for over a year now, and get compliments on my clean and clear skin. My skin is nearly flawless and glows from within. I get compliments all day long and feel great leaving my house with or without makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been using the toner for over 10 yrs and the results speaks for itself; soft smooth radiant skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades.  I&#x27;m completely a fan of Obaji.  I love it.  I try to keep this stuff in stock at home so I don&#x27;t run out.  I find the better prices through Amazon than buying it at my doctor.</li>
    <li> always love this product, it makes cleanses my skin while keeping it soft and smooth. The transaction was smooth and quick!</li>
    <li> I use the entire line of Obagi products and doubt I will ever use anything else on my face.  They all work great and my skin looks and feels great also.</li>
    <li> love this toner it doesn&#x27;t burn when you use it like most toners do, it leaves the skin soft and clean!</li>
    <li> I have been using obagi for many years now.  It was recommend it by my dermatologist.  It helped me get rid of sun damage and other imperfections on my skin.  Toner is an essential part of the system. I highly recommend obagi</li>
    <li> Love the toner.  Have used this Obagi product for a long tme and will continue to use.  Product is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi cleanser and toner for a number of years.  My skin looks and feels good.  I think that it has really improved my skin.  People ask me all the time what I use.</li>
    <li> No burning sensation like other toners I have tried.  Skin feels great after use and I see the extra debris it pull off my skin that I miss after washing my face.  Skin feel refreashed and not tight as with other toners.</li>
    <li> I have used the Obagi Toner, along with the Cleanser for many years and love the product. It has a fresh smell, and has been consistant in keeping my skin blemish free.</li>
    <li> Using the Obagi product line is like getting a face lift without the face lift.  Keeps my skin soft and has evened the skin tone and I no longer have any break outs.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> All of the above were a great buy.  The one Item that I was not pleased with, was the Obagi Blender, which was over the expiration date and discolored, but that was sent from a spa.</li>
    <li> It seems to9 have improve my complexion since I started using it.Makes your face feel so clean and refreshed with daily use</li>
    <li> I am 51 and still get breakouts.  this obagi system helps them clear up faster and makes my skin smoother and brighter.</li>
    <li> Seems to be real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We checked it against the exact same product (which costs many times more) from her dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We looked at both closely side by side and it looks legit.</li>
    <li> Its cheap but you charge me the shipping. My skin does not dry if I use it. I use this toner everyday night and day before putting any make up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two years and my skin looks better now than it did two years ago despite my age.  I use it after the Nu Derm Foaming Gel which I use with my Clairasonic.</li>
    <li> The product is great after washing your face and needing that extra wake up feeling.  Use before a good day cream and you&#x27;ll feel fresher.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years - a lot gentler than toners you buy in a retail store</li>
    <li> Just started using this after I completed my peel process.  This really removes any remaining residue after cleansing, as sets the base for final moisurtizing application.  Wonderful product again!</li>
    <li> Very good product. It blance my skin ph. I feel my face smooth, soft immediately after applied.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4stars, because there isn&#x27;t expiration date on it</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I feel that it penetrates very quickly in the skin. It&#x27;s a really good hydrating cream and I like the soothing effect.</li>
    <li> I used this product just a few days and can see results improving my skin discolorations.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Definitely, an Obagi advocate, absolutely the best product for my skin!</li>
    <li> ok so you require so many words in your review when all i need to say is buy it it works! It arrived on time and is a good deal for the money honey</li>
    <li> This is an item I have used for years.  However, I have been looking for the item at a lower price.  Well I found it.  It also helps that shipping is free.  Great deal!</li>
