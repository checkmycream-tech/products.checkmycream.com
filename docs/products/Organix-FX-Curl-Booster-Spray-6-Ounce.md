      <li>tis fab!cant do without it:)</li>
      <li>I love this curl booster.  </li>
      <li>I could definitley smell more alcohol in the bulk products  </li>
      <li>Love this spray, it keeps and holds my curls.</li>
      <li>and I was so glad I found it.</li>
      <li>Once the stores stopped carrying it, I bought this in bulk off of amazon in order to stock up on my favorite product.</li>
      <li>&amp;  whyyyyy does it smell so strongly like fingernail polish remover?</li>
      <li>It is light but holds style well.</li>
      <li>My hair is super fine and this spray keeps it in place but can&#x27;t tell there is any spray on it.</li>
      <li>This product works great on dry hair to revive my curls for another day.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair nice curly, soft not crunchy.full of shine and bounce.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>My favorite hair spray ever but apparently no longer available!  </li>
      <li>Shortly after, my hair started to get really damaged(dry, unruly hairs on scalp, ) and was not looking as good.</li>
      <li>But it gives such a nice curl.</li>
      <li>It is the only product that works really good on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Very high priced item though!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of wondering why I spent $15 on this</li>
      <li>Overall, going to use it anyway :)</li>
      <li>Probably asking for it to do too much!</li>
      <li>I used it once so far at night on wet hair and seemed to get good results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gotten hard to find in my local stores but good ole Amazon came thru again. :-)</li>
      <li>so I get pretty high humidity.</li>
      <li>this is the best stuff I have ever used to tame the curly mess that is my hair.</li>
      <li>This spray controls the frizz and almost acts like hairspray and water but without too much crunch.</li>
      <li>It is more expensive than it was in stores, but I have paid more for inferior products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I live about a mile off the west coast</li>
      <li>and she says she prefers it far more than other products designed to do the same thing.</li>
      <li>I bought several bottles online because I liked it enough to hunt down a new source for it.</li>
      <li>I have mixed waves, straight, and some curls.  </li>
      <li>naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
      <li>I was hoping that this would make the straighter areas curlier to even out a natural look, but it didn&#x27;t, so it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  </li>
      <li>Not too tight, not too loose, not crunchy, soft and full curls, no frizz.</li>
      <li>and it is a nappy, frizzy, hot mess.</li>

    <li> This is a great all-purpose hair spray,  not just for curls.........holds well, no buildup, kind to hair.  Arrived on time and in good condition.  will buy again</li>
    <li> this spray is the best of the best.....curls do what YOU want and hwere u want...tis fab!cant do without it:)</li>
    <li> I love this curl booster.  It is the only product that works really good on my naturally curly hair.  I have tried a lot of other products, too.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My friend, for whom I bought FX Curl Booster Spray, is very pleased with it. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it for her and she says she prefers it far more than other products designed to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Leaves my hair nice curly, soft not crunchy.full of shine and bounce.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at Wal Mart but they quit carrying it for some reason. I bought several bottles online because I liked it enough to hunt down a new source for it. Now I have found that Walgreens carries it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before.  It&#x27;s great to hold your curls!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It does give your curls a boost if they are limp looking, but it does leave it kind of sticky and a little stiff. That&#x27;s why I only gave it 3 stars. But it will define your curls and perk up limp strands. It does for me.  I have naturally curly/wavy hair and I do color my hair.</li>
    <li> Wish this were still available!  Great product to make hair curl up.  Especially if your hair is thin!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, and now I can&#x27;t find it in stores! It holds curls, creates shine, and doesn&#x27;t dry my fine, thin, dry hair out. Amazon, please continue to sell this. It is more expensive than it was in stores, but I have paid more for inferior products.</li>
    <li> Great product, well protected for shipping.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for a couple years and would get great results. Once the stores stopped carrying it, I bought this in bulk off of amazon in order to stock up on my favorite product. Shortly after, my hair started to get really damaged(dry, unruly hairs on scalp, ) and was not looking as good. I wonder if what I ordered was legit? Or, did my hair just have enough of the alcohol content  in this product? I could definitley smell more alcohol in the bulk products  I ordered. Needless to say, I have to switch products to save my hair. I am now trying the sister product to this, the gel one.. I used it once so far at night on wet hair and seemed to get good results. The gel does not have alcohol in it. I hope this will work for me for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. You have to use a generous amount. I usually only get about 7 applications per bottle maybe. But it gives such a nice curl. Not too tight, not too loose, not crunchy, soft and full curls, no frizz. It&#x27;s awesome! I hope it never stops being made.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for FX Curl Booster for several months and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I found it here and I was so glad I found it. I ordered it and it came in the mail in just a few days. I am very happy with Amazon.com and I will order again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite curl spray. I use it on day 2 of my curly hair after I wake up and it is a nappy, frizzy, hot mess. I live about a mile off the west coast so I get pretty high humidity. This spray controls the frizz and almost acts like hairspray and water but without too much crunch. Add a little small blast from a blow dryer and people usually give me more compliments on day 2 than day 1. Definitely try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair spray ever but apparently no longer available!  It is light but holds style well. My hair is super fine and this spray keeps it in place but can&#x27;t tell there is any spray on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product locally a year ago,  but now can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I like the small size bottle for travelling and the texture it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> Thanks! Quick delivery. Very high priced item though!</li>
    <li> They discontinued this product in the store and I was so happy to find it on line.  This product works great on dry hair to revive my curls for another day.</li>
    <li> Love this spray, it keeps and holds my curls.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed with this product</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff I have ever used to tame the curly mess that is my hair. It&#x27;s gotten hard to find in my local stores but good ole Amazon came thru again. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of wondering why I spent $15 on this and it comes with green price tag on it saying $1.50?!?!? &amp;  whyyyyy does it smell so strongly like fingernail polish remover? Ugh</li>
    <li> I have mixed waves, straight, and some curls.  I was hoping that this would make the straighter areas curlier to even out a natural look, but it didn&#x27;t, so it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  Probably asking for it to do too much!</li>
    <li> Good product but I ordered the spray instead of the gel.  Overall, going to use it anyway :)</li>
