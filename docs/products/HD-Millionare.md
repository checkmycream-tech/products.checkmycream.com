      <li>I love this product because I can use it even after I shower</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t make your skin orange at all</li>
      <li>I always make sure I&#x27;m stocked up on HD Millionare.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought better tanning products.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t decided if I would buy it again or not, leaning towards yes unless I find something better.</li>
      <li>Smells ok.</li>
      <li>plus it could smell better</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I happen to like all that glitz, glitter, bling, and sparkle, so the more the better.  </li>
      <li>This is a 5 star if ever there was one, leaves my skin soft and supple with a beautiful glow.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really obey the circular motion rule :p</li>
      <li>It has a clean, refreshing fragrant to it.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a tanning boost I strongly recommend this product....</li>
      <li>but so far I am loving it!</li>
      <li>It is the exact same lotion at a fraction of the cost and it is a wonderful alternative to tanning everyday and it is also a great tan extender!</li>
      <li>and it gives me a very pretty shimmery glow!</li>
      <li>The label suggests to use it more frequently if you want better results.</li>
      <li>The tan doesn&#x27;t last as good, and the glitter in it can be a nu-sense.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite thing about this lotion is the way it smells.</li>
      <li>The scent is wonderful and the slight sparkle in the lotion really makes my skin glow.</li>
      <li>My new favorite product.</li>
      <li>I used this together with a bronzed spray and it worked great and didn&#x27;t leave uneven marks either.</li>
      <li>I think that really applies when you first begin using it to avoid any streaks or spots but once you have a good color, putting it on like regular lotion works just as well.</li>
      <li>I first bought this product at a tanning salon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure this product works or not cause I only used it once, but it probably does.  </li>
      <li>lol I have gotten at least 5 shades darker.</li>
      <li>You get color from the first day application.</li>
      <li>I tan pretty easily but have never been able to get very dark.</li>
      <li>Subtle self tanner and smells great.</li>
      <li>It has a good amount of gold glitter in it which can be good or bad depending.</li>
      <li>Pretty decent though!</li>
      <li>This tan extendor lotion has too much glitter to use.  </li>
      <li>And it didn&#x27;t moisturize very well.</li>
      <li>but I just refuse to pay that much money just to give those snotty high school girls</li>
      <li>, it provides a very natural color on your skin.</li>
      <li>I applied this  for a few days before a  beach vacation, and I was going to get a spray tan right before leaving, but I  did not even need it anymore after 3 or 4 days applying this product!</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good, starts to have a weird smell after having it on for a few hours.</li>

<li> Works very well for a subtle tan.</li>
<li> I expected a lot out of this product from all the reviews I read.</li>
<li> Even adds a little shimmer to your skin.</li>
<li> and even they are amazed at how dark they are!</li>
<li> Does have a little bit of shimmer to it, which I thought was unnoticeable, but some people have asked me if I am wearing glitter.  </li>
<li> Not sure about the proloning the tan b/c i just started using it</li>
<li> Not as bad as other similar products though.</li>
<li> Also, I HATED the way it smelled when I first started using it!</li>
<li> This lotion is sold for at least $80 in the tanning salons</li>

<li> With an added touch of gold shimmer, I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m boarder line obsessed with this stuff!</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have a terrible smell either.</li>

    <li> One of my favorite lotions of all time.  Does have a little bit of shimmer to it, which I thought was unnoticeable, but some people have asked me if I am wearing glitter.  Still love its bronzing effect!</li>
    <li> TAN EXTENDER!!! Not for bed use.. After tan and shower session. Smells ok. Glittery.</li>
    <li> This extender is absolutely amazing!!!  It doesn&#x27;t just extend your tan it amplifies it!! I tan pretty easily but have never been able to get very dark. NOT ANYMORE lol I have gotten at least 5 shades darker. I have friends that have very fair skin and even they are amazed at how dark they are! It is seriously a miracle product!! If you are looking for a tanning boost I strongly recommend this product.... Some advice on how to use it: If you are just starting to tan and haven&#x27;t got your base tan yet, I would lay a few times before using this lotion to avoid streaking.. It says to apply in circular motions after tanning and showering. I don&#x27;t really obey the circular motion rule :p I think that really applies when you first begin using it to avoid any streaks or spots but once you have a good color, putting it on like regular lotion works just as well. I don&#x27;t always put it on twice a day but I do notice a bigger difference faster when I do. Also, I HATED the way it smelled when I first started using it! I am used to it now but it did take me a while lol Hope I have answered any questions you had!! I promise if you buy this lotion you will NOT regret it! Happy Tanning :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought better tanning products. The tan doesn&#x27;t last as good, and the glitter in it can be a nu-sense. The fragrance was disappointing.</li>
    <li> You get color from the first day application. A uniform golden glow, and it smells nice too! I applied this  for a few days before a  beach vacation, and I was going to get a spray tan right before leaving, but I  did not even need it anymore after 3 or 4 days applying this product! Amazon has it for a great price, so I always keep it stocked !</li>
    <li> This lotion is sold for at least $80 in the tanning salons but I just refuse to pay that much money just to give those snotty high school girls the commission they so obviously work toward. It is the exact same lotion at a fraction of the cost and it is a wonderful alternative to tanning everyday and it is also a great tan extender!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for my wedding for two months now and spray tanned yesterday and used this today and it gives me a very pretty shimmery glow! Not sure about the proloning the tan b/c i just started using it but so far I am loving it! :) Would highly recommend to woman who are wanting to achieve a beautiful glow!</li>
    <li> This is a 5 star if ever there was one, leaves my skin soft and supple with a beautiful glow. In the Salon where I tan this sells for 45.00. I&#x27;m well into my 50&#x27;s and if it can make my skin look like it&#x27;s glowing imagine what it will do for those of you who are much younger!!</li>
    <li> this lotion is kind of sticky and im not a fan of all the sparkles plus it could smell better</li>
    <li> I really, really, REALLY love this lotion! It was suggested to me at my tanning salon because I was placing my membership on hold. I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that it&#x27;s a tan extender, aka sunless tanning lotion. I love that it doesn&#x27;t make your skin orange at all, it provides a very natural color on your skin. My absolute favorite thing about this lotion is the way it smells. It&#x27;s difficult to explain, but I would say it&#x27;s a sultry, sexy, powdery scent to it. With an added touch of gold shimmer, I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m boarder line obsessed with this stuff!</li>
    <li> I first bought this product at a tanning salon but it was quite expensive. I then found it on Amazon for a great price and was thrilled! The scent is wonderful and the slight sparkle in the lotion really makes my skin glow. I get compliments on it whenever I wear it. It also helps to extend my tan a bit longer. Try it, you&#x27;ll LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I always make sure I&#x27;m stocked up on HD Millionare. It has a unique scent that I love!!! And the sparkles make my skin look so nice. Love this.</li>
    <li> Great product and lasts longer than most! I used this together with a bronzed spray and it worked great and didn&#x27;t leave uneven marks either.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can use it even after I shower and i still keep my tan and it darkens my skin too!&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> My new favorite product. Subtle self tanner and smells great. Even adds a little shimmer to your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product after tanning and bathing for a week. It smells pretty good, starts to have a weird smell after having it on for a few hours. Not as bad as other similar products though. It has a good amount of gold glitter in it which can be good or bad depending. I&#x27;ve noticed my tan is darker than it would be without using the product. The label suggests to use it more frequently if you want better results. I would like to see a &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34; and/or &amp;#34;cellulite reducer&amp;#34; in the lotion, never hurts. I haven&#x27;t decided if I would buy it again or not, leaning towards yes unless I find something better. Pretty decent though!</li>
    <li> This tan extendor lotion has too much glitter to use.  I needed a bath after using it to go out into public.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but it gave no gradual color. And it didn&#x27;t moisturize very well. I expected a lot out of this product from all the reviews I read. I even used it in the morning and evening for a &amp;#34;twice-a-day&amp;#34; application hoping that would work. It still didn&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Received this item yesterday.  Couldn&#x27;t use it but just had to open it to smell it.  I loved LOVED LOVED the smell.  I was smelling it all day cause it smelled so good.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, which I did today.  It has a clean, refreshing fragrant to it.  As for the sparkles, they are so minute, and you can&#x27;t even see them unless your outside in the sunlight.  I happen to like all that glitz, glitter, bling, and sparkle, so the more the better.  I&#x27;m not even sure this product works or not cause I only used it once, but it probably does.  I&#x27;m just so happy it smells good and theres sparkles in it.  I would purchase this again.  I would recommend it.  But not everyone will like it of course, but I do, and thats what counts.</li>
    <li> it smells really good, and gives you a real nice tan. only used once and show a big difference in my tan</li>
    <li> Works very well for a subtle tan. Sometimes I could still see streaks but they weren&#x27;t too noticeable. It doesn&#x27;t have a terrible smell either. I will buy this product again in the future.</li>
</ol>
