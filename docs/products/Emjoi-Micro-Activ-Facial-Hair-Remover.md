### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>I used it on my face first then tried to use it under my arms - Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>But it works great.</li>
      <li>good quality.</li>
      <li>Once you get brave and take the plastic guard off it gets everything nice and tidy.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the Emjoi Micro Hair remover.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy with the results I works very well</li>
      <li>I have another emjoi for my legs and love it.</li>
      <li>But, who knows; I have to use it more often than I thought.</li>
      <li>If I had it to do over I would have purchased a better one.</li>
      <li>and it felt better.</li>
      <li>, OK</li>
      <li>Very effective, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The design was not like the original.</li>
      <li>Does not work as good as expected.</li>
      <li>It does not feel as good as my other one.  </li>
      <li>Even though I still like the original design, I would order this particular design in a minute.</li>
      <li>It does a good job with little irritation.</li>
      <li>You definitely feel more sensation.  </li>
      <li>After first time hair will be a shorter length</li>
      <li>I bought this product to remove facial hair, and I was quite pleased with the result on the first use.  </li>
      <li>I suggest you shorten hair on face first.  </li>
      <li>When I first ordered this I really did not like it at all.</li>
      <li>I am very DISAPOINTED</li>
      <li>It really does not remove the hair well &amp; hair that is removed grows back really quickly.</li>
      <li>It is not painful as long as you follow their instruction of holding the skin taut when using...more of a tingle sensation rather than &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The smaller size makes this fairly easy to use following their directions.  </li>
      <li>This product works really well removing facial hair, but it hurts like heck if you are not prepared to follow the instructions!</li>
      <li>Much cheaper and more convenient than professional waxing and WAY less mess than home waxing.</li>
      <li>Item works decently once you can get it to work properly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small and too light weight for the price, but I could handle that if it actually did what it advertised.</li>
      <li>Maybe I expected too much.</li>
      <li>I think the secret of using this and being able to remove the hair is in holding it at the correct angle.</li>

    <li> I have another emjoi for my legs and love it. I was anxious to try this one. It does not feel as good as my other one.  You definitely feel more sensation.  But it works great. I suggest you shorten hair on face first.  I did this and it felt better. After first time hair will be a shorter length</li>
    <li> I am very DISAPOINTED</li>
    <li> This is the worse hair remover that I have ever seen.  It hurts and pulls so bad, you cannot use this on your face or anywhere close to your skin , it will pull the skin from your face.  IT IS HORRIBLE, I WASTED $25.00 ON THIS ITEM AND WISH I COULD RETURN TO GET MY MONY BACK, DO NOT ORDER THIS, YOU CAN&#x27;T USE IT,</li>
    <li> This product is a sham. I bought it and tried to use it twice, no hair was taken off. It&#x27;s small and too light weight for the price, but I could handle that if it actually did what it advertised. Save your money. I threw mine in the trash after trying to use it twice for naught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary,&lt;br /&gt;Ardmore, OK</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Emjoi Micro Hair remover.  The smaller size makes this fairly easy to use following their directions.  It is not painful as long as you follow their instruction of holding the skin taut when using...more of a tingle sensation rather than &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;.

    <li> Maybe I expected too much. If I had it to do over I would have purchased a better one. But, who knows; I have to use it more often than I thought.</li>
    <li> I did not like the Emjoi Micro-Activ Facial Hair Remover. I pulled the hair and hurt. Will not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t remove all the the hair on my face, so I was a little disappointed.  I bought it to remove the hair, not so I still need to shave!</li>
    <li> I obviously didn&#x27;t know what I was ordering. It feels like a tazer!! I will never use it . I will give it away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the finer parts to zap.  I use this on part of my face my other facial device does not get.  This even removes the smallest hairs.</li>
    <li> pinches a bit.  good quality.</li>
    <li> Very effective, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product works really well removing facial hair, but it hurts like heck if you are not prepared to follow the instructions!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  It&#x27;s kinda rough on my face.&lt;br /&gt;However, it may work for you~give it a try.</li>
    <li> Does not work as good as expected.</li>
    <li> Horrible ...painful and causes serious bumps on the face. Does not remove all the hairs.....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. It doesn&#x27;t remove the hair, just cuts it. Oh well. It is what it is.</li>
    <li> Once you get brave and take the plastic guard off it gets everything nice and tidy. Much cheaper and more convenient than professional waxing and WAY less mess than home waxing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to remove facial hair, and I was quite pleased with the result on the first use.  It does a good job with little irritation.</li>
    <li> Item works decently once you can get it to work properly.  Very awkward to use.  Not as painful and I anticipated.  I am not sure if I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what ever possessed me to buy this.  It plucks about 30 hairs at a time and hurts like H___!  I used it on my face first then tried to use it under my arms - Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife, but I tried it on my face and it gets the job done, but tweezing is not for me. I&#x27;ll stick to a razor.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the results I works very well I will have to try the other products from this company</li>
    <li> This product hurts. A lot. It really does not remove the hair well &amp; hair that is removed grows back really quickly.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this I really did not like it at all. The design was not like the original. The other day I decided to give it another try. It worked perfectly. Even though I still like the original design, I would order this particular design in a minute.</li>
    <li> I used it one time and it was extremely painful. Returned it</li>
