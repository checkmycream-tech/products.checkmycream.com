<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Couldn&#x27;t find one in the store that didn&#x27;t have alcohol in it</li>
    <li> Great product. Great seller.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a homemade deodorant recipe but LOVE to use it on baby&#x27;s skin. Great for clearing up what they call &amp;#34;baby ache,&amp;#34; super gentle, calms the skin down!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for products but this one was too good not to. I learned about this product watching Kathleen Lights videos on YouTube. Other toners I&#x27;ve tried in the past have completely dried out my skin, burned when applied, or just didn&#x27;t do anything. But not Thayers.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have combination/oily skin that is super sensitive and lately, I&#x27;ve had a horrible problem with under the surface acne on my chin that just wouldn&#x27;t go away- something that I almost never have a problem with. Within two days of using this, my skin started clearing up! There was a bit of a transition period for the skin around my chin where I was getting the acne, but it&#x27;s completely cleared up and smooth now! And the rest of my face is loving it too! I normally end up looking like I have an oil slick on my face by the end of the day and no mattifying primer has ever helped. Since using this, my skin stays completely hydrated and completely matte all day long. I just can&#x27;t believe how much this has improved my skin. I am a Thayers customer for life!!!</li>
    <li> thayers leaves your face feeling fresh and clean, and it lasts a long time. The unscented formula is undetectable unless you put you nose directly on the bottle, even then its still faint. I like to apply after a nice shave. I like it!</li>
    <li> Works great. Keeps razor burn away and also treats it.</li>
    <li> I mix Witch Hazel with argan oil or olive oil.  It helps with the itch and I don&#x27;t scratch as much as I did. Very happy with the product and will order again.</li>
    <li> I use it after washing my face and it really helps to control oil and shine. I don&#x27;t even feel like I need an extra moisturizer after using this, it makes my skin so comfortable and soft. I have only used it for a few days, so my pores haven&#x27;t shrunk yet as I had hoped, but I will give it a few weeks and hopefully get some results on that.</li>
    <li> I used this on several customers and they love it, I have also used it on myself and found it to heal nicks fairly quickly. No burning sensation. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff.  I use it after washing my face and really works.  Non-irritating and non-allergenic!</li>
    <li> I have moderate acne and I started using proactive to get rid of that, which it did, but it also dried out my face. So I got this and started applying it right after the last step of my proactive. They work very well together and it keeps my skin full of moisture. I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything and the added aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;When I got the package, the cap was slightly broken and if the bottle gets tilted it leaks, but that may have been the shipping company&#x27;s fault. Either way, I love this stuff and I will never go back.</li>
    <li> Used for post partum recovery and for acne!</li>
    <li> I use this as part of my recipe for homemade baby wipes. Works great!</li>
    <li> I never knew I was using the wrong kind of Witch Hazel. For years I had read about the benefits of Witch Hazel and I was using the one with Alcohol in it. It would leave me dry and red. I hated it and couldn&#x27;t understand what all the hype was about. After a little bit of research I found this and it has worked wonders. Anytime I have anything going on that needs healing or toning, I use this and it works wonders. Doesn&#x27;t smell, doesn&#x27;t sting...it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Works as intended and advertised</li>
    <li> Although I love witch hazel,  I won&#x27;t buy this brand again because the bottle is not airtight at all.  Be careful not to let it sit sideways,  and it definitely can&#x27;t travel in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> has done great things fr my skin</li>
    <li> This is great to add to your skin care routine. It is an astringent and toner, and it does a great job in cleaning out your skin and tightening pores. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and I usually squeeze a cap full onto a round cotton pad in the morning and before going to bed. After using your cleanser, the witch hazel formula removes excess dirt and makeup that you might have missed. It doesn&#x27;t smell of anything and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. It&#x27;s very light and does a great job in soothing your skin, cleansing, and refining pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard of this stuff all my life but never knew what it was.  It&#x27;s a great way to clean your face without alcohol.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works wonderfully</li>
    <li> This toner feels very nice on your skin. I bought it because it was unscented, and as an added bonus it is also alcohol free.</li>
    <li> Very nice stuff. The product arrived in two days. It smells very good and I love the design. I&#x27;m using it every day.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve been using it as a facial cleanser as I am trying to avoid chemicals. It smells pleasant unlike the cheap stuff with added alcohol that you can buy at certain *-Mart stores. I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best items in my shaving process. It has almost no scent and is completely unnoticeable after about 10 seconds. A quick splash on my face after shaving is fantastic and helps it heal. Great value.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just get this right out of the gate: this is some amazing liquid. I can&#x27;t say it enough. Everyone does it: they find a product that performs amazingly and won&#x27;t want to live without. This is how I feel about Thayer&#x27;s Toner in Unscented. I use this as an aftershave splash, a way to clean my face after heavy sweating or a dirty activity, and a before bed clean up. A bottle lasts me about a month. Not only &#x27;cause I use it a lot, but I don&#x27;t follow the directions of putting it on a cotton pad or ball; I just pour a small amount in my hand splash it on my face and rub it around. Doing this everyday has resulted in a much better complexion and healthier feel and look. Why do I prefer this botle over the other Thayer&#x27;s products of witchhazel? Well, the toners contain no alcohol, which is a plus since alcohol can be a bit drying. The other reason is because the unscented is just that-UNSCENTED! Doesn&#x27;t smell of anything, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my cologne. Plus, for the sensitive skin people, no fragrance means less irritation. Definitely recommend, time and time again.</li>
    <li> This product has a faint smell of aloe. It works great as a face toner. I also used it in a homemade bug repellant! Will probably purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> I use this product as a natural face toner. It&#x27;s unscented and alcohol-free, so it doesn&#x27;t burn. It does remove excess dirt and oil, which I can visibly see on the cotton pad. It&#x27;s not drying and makes my skin soft. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants an inexpensive, effective skin toner.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to make my homemade deodorant.  Will by again!</li>
    <li> We love this. It feels nice and refreshing. leaves behind no odor. My teenager has started using it and has noticeably less oily skin.</li>
    <li> Good witch hazel. I use it for post-shave and for cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> I was using this daily, under arms was fine full strength but on face too drying and was getting breakouts.  So diluted it more that 50% with water and put in a jar and it works much better and of course lasts longer.  Going to order again.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a year for daily use after washing my face or shaving, and it has done wonders for redness and acne.</li>
    <li> Happy with it ,didn&#x27;t break me out ,I used to only use Vichy toner  ,but this one seems to do the same job and its much cheaper .</li>
    <li> Best toner - great price. Removes any soap residue  without drying.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, need to buy more of it now haha.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and it works great as an aftershave and keeping skin clean and clear. I usually moisturize afterword and I&#x27;ve noticed my pimples decrease!</li>
    <li> I like this Thayers unscented organic formula.I have some discoloration on d sides of my face after a recent pregnancy. Was so suprised that as i used this formula it faded the dark areas and gave me a more even skin tone Still have some way to go but it cleanses well and tones as well. i would recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME. I&#x27;m always looking for new ways to naturally take care of my skin and witch hazel was definitely a great discovery. I&#x27;m pretty lazy, so I was delighted to find that this product keeps my face clear whether or not I washed my face prior to use. I love that there&#x27;s no alcohol in this because that stuff actually dries your skin out. This witch hazel keeps my skin hydrated! I&#x27;ll definitely be adding this item to my arsenal of skincare products.</li>
    <li> Using this for my home made bug and tick repellant! Love that it is alcohol free. Very good stuff! So many uses!</li>
    <li> It leaves a slightly sticky feeling to my skin. Might just be my skin type. It is gentle and does not irritate or dry.  I use it for skin irritations, but not as a cleansing wipe on my face.</li>
    <li> Part of my post shave routine. I use alum first, dab dry with towel then splash on thayers. I love this product and it has no odor so it does not overpower my soap smells. Great product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. I use this for all kinds of things, from toner to small cuts/pimples.</li>
    <li> standard witch hazel...works well.</li>
    <li> I pay ridiculous prices for ink only because I have to.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from razor burn and irritation for months and months. After using this product along with some others the irritation I get from shaving is almost gone. To paraphrase another reviewer, this product is holy water for your face. I HIGHLY recommend picking some up if you want your skin to look and feel nicer, whether or not you need it with shaving.</li>
    <li> not irritating and helps dryness and oiliness</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in those areas where fungi tend to grow. I live in a warm / hot / humid environment and get rashes and itch . . . you get the idea, don&#x27;t you? Anyway, I put this on after a shower, and / or before getting dressed and it works great. Underarms, feet- you name it.&lt;br /&gt;Mild &amp;#34;aloe-vera-ee&amp;#34; pleasant odor. Dries quickly with no residue feeling.&lt;br /&gt;And it seems to be helping with dry skin too.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mr. Thayer!</li>
    <li> So I may differ from any comments that may seem fake by just saying &amp;#34;great toner!&amp;#34;, I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that most face washes* require a twice-per-day use (morning and night). The problem with this method is that by the time you wash your face at night, your skin starts to get over-cleansed and dried up like a used scrubbing pad (at least mine does). My face wash is organic (from 100% Pure&#x27;s acne detox line) and works great in the morning, but I need something that would tone my face and cleanse it at the same time LIGHTLY before going to bed each night. I discovered Witch Hazel is an acne-fighting substance found in many natural remedies for blemishes. This bottle in particular is only seven dollars and change (free shipping) and not only does it contain Witch hazel, but citris (orange), aloe vera, and other essential leaf oils. It is so light on the skin and keeps you fresh - can be applied at any time, anywhere, and is even safe around the lips and eyes (from my experience). It is a great price and a great product. I order a new one every month.</li>
    <li> My new go-to toner!  This one is alcohol free and I like the way it feels. I replaces my fancy-pants-department store-high-end full-of-alcohol toner.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and this toner is amazing!! The best thing of all is the quantity for the price! I use it once a day in the morning and my face feels great. No breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love this toner.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but does make it feel cleaner and it is natural.</li>
    <li> Great and without alcohol. Unfortunately it has aloe vera which I&#x27;m allergic to. I was pretty sure I bought the one without, but I received this one instead.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered right on time and is perfect.  It makes my skin so toned and even.  I love it</li>
    <li> After ceaselessly looking for a good natural aftershave product I came across this, you splash some after your shave and leaves your face feleif clean, mosturized, and refreshed. All natural! Would definitely recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I have used this over alcohol based aftershaves for nearly a month!  My skin feels refreshed and hydrated rather than on fire and dried out like alcohol based ones.  Also after it has dried, my skin is more receptive to hydrating products to be absorbed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe in washing your face twice a day. I think it strips away our natural oils and over dries our skin. Then, we tend to look older, and nobody wants that! I don&#x27;t use any harsh products.  I try to go natural when it comes to my skin. I normally clean my face with this in the mornings, because our skin doesn&#x27;t get dirty at night. If needed,  I rinse my face with filtered water ONLY at night. Before I shower, I clean my face with ACV and it helps clear out my pores. Honey is another go to cleansing agent and it leaves your skin soft and glowing.  It&#x27;s also great for milia.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I would do without my Thayer&#x27;s. I chose the non alcohol formula,  because we all know, alcohol is good at drying the skin. Then, it tries to compensate for the loss of oil by producing even more. My # 1 face product.</li>
    <li> It is so gentle and cooling, I applied it directly after a very harsh fruit acid peel and it did not irritate my skin at all, quite the contrary. I will continue to use this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> feels good after using it.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome, feels nice and clean on the skin and doesn&#x27;t contain any undesirables like Alum Blocks &amp; Styptic Pencils do. helps stop bleeding from minor nicks after shaving. also nice because it is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with your deodorant or cologne scent which can become too overwhelming with other aftershaves.</li>
    <li> This product is difficult to find at stores in my area. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to have it shipped to my home at a reasonable price. Leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I also put it in a small spray bottle with some essential oils and keep it in my purse to freshen up my face and body throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This Witch Hazel is the best.  I bought it from Thayer.  No alcohol and I love the fact that you can by unscented as well as Rose or Cucumber fragrance.  I use the unscented on my face, in my essential oils blends and any other use that I don&#x27;t want the fragrance changed.  I use the Rose in my homemade hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it does a great job of cleaning my face, especially after shaving.  It does not have any odor, which is a plus for me and a little goes a long way.  I will definitely be buying another bottle when the time comes.</li>
    <li> this is really wonderful, especially if you have sensitive skin and are sensitive to smells, its has no smell at all and once you put it on your skin its really refreshing. I don&#x27;t know if this happened to anyone else but it made my acne scars disappear, these scars were not old ones just new ones but wow.</li>
    <li> NOTE: I write this same review on the Rose Scented version, but as I used the Unscented one during my adventures, I thought I&#x27;d post it here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I wanted to like this product, every way I tried to use it, it just didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to keep my facial routine as natural as possible, washing with raw honey and using alba botanica&#x27;s aloe&amp;green tea oil-free moisturizer, but I decided that I wanted to use a toner. My face is more of a normal-combination (normally, not to oily, but not too dry), but I had some bad break outs in the past that left some discolored scars/skin and I heard that witch hazel and rose water can help reverse those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came across this product in my search, and saw that they sold it at Whole Foods, I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;My face had started breaking out randomly, so when I began using the toner after washing and before moisturizing, and found even more break outs day after day.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give it a chance and thought maybe it was my skin \\&quot;purging\\&quot; or the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; in it was causing the problem. I like the scent of roses and I didn&#x27;t think the smell was overpowering, but I read other reviews on other sites with people stating the same problem - the fragrance was breaking them out because their skin was/is sensitive to most fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;So, I went back to Whole Foods and bought the alcohol-free, unscented toner. I gave myself a few days of not using the Rose scented one to give my face a break, but when I started using the unscented one, the same thing happened, I got small breaks outs again, just not as severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I decided to cut my losses and stopped using it on my face, but I had read that it could be used as an aftershave and, so I gave that a go instead of returning it.&lt;br /&gt;Nope. Didn&#x27;t work. My face cooled down and stopped breaking out, but I started getting a fair amount of weird pimples and breakouts and ingrown hairs on my legs which veryvery very rarely happens.&lt;br /&gt;I used both the rose and the unscented one as well as new razor blades, just in case it was my blade, and not the toner.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why it would cause this kind of reaction, especially since I use body lotions that have oils in them as well as aloe gel for my face after my moisturizer. My face isn&#x27;t severely sensitive either, so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would have worked out, because it did work. Aside from the breakouts, old scars were fading, dark circles under my eyes looked lighter and less puffy, and I did like leaving the bathroom smelling of roses, but it would be a really strange catch-22 to use something that&#x27;s helping remove old scars but replacing them with new ones.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it works for others, but I&#x27;ll continue my search for a good toner if I find I need it (i&#x27;ve recently changed to using derma e products), and just wear rose perfume, haha!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Dr. Perricone&#x27;s Super Detox Elixir? What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Murad Clarifying Toner?  What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Olek Henriksen Grease Relief Face Tonic?  I could go on and on.....but I&#x27;ll just let you know. It&#x27;s witch hazel, which you can find in your local pharmacy for a few bucks,  is a great astringent. And its one in its purest form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is witch hazel? It is the leaves and bark of the North American shrub known as Hamamelis Virginiana (sometimes you might see this on a label as an ingredient in your favorite toner or astringent instead of the words \\&quot;witch hazel\\&quot;).  Witch hazel naturally grows in Nova Scotia in Canada, and Florida in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch hazel can be used for so many things but using it as your daily astringent can not only give you great skin but also a lot of bang for your buck! In addition, witch hazel is an herbal and natural product and thus it is great for sensitive skin. You can apply it after shaving, waxing and any kind of skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason you can find witch hazel in so many skin care products.  It has so many benefits: it reduces excess sweating and oil secretion, helps with large pores, treats acne, and helps with various other skin conditions.  The astringent also has anti-inflammatory properties. If you have ever had a facial, you will notice that usually after extractions, your aesthetician will apply with hazel to your skin. Witch hazel can also help prevent the development of acne as well as treat existing acne and pimples. This is the reason why it is frequently used in acne skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another approach for using witch hazel astringent is treating psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, diaper rash and poison ivy rash in the natural way. Witch hazel is also one of the best herbal remedies for alleviating sunburns and windburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is that you can pick it up at your local pharmacy for about five bucks!

    <li> works great, no overpowering scent, and not tested on animals.  great!</li>
    <li> I used it as a baby bottom wash with soft re-usable bamboo cloths: http://www.amazon.com/Bamboo-Towels-Washable-Reusable-replaces/dp/B00KWBSDYC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1434405491&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;reusable+bamboo+roll&lt;br /&gt;, instead of baby wipes.  Worked great.  Since there&#x27;s no alcohol, and witch hazel is therapeutic, and has natural anti-inflamatory and anti-fungal properties, it&#x27;s perfect for that body part.  Also works well to treat cradle cap (baby dandruff) applied with cotton balls, daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for a while.  My skin is far less oily and shiny that it used to be.  You start to see its full effect after several days of continuous use, so give it a fair chance.  It&#x27;s not magic.  This product does what it says it does, and if you get it as an add-on it&#x27;s very inexpensive. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this to make eye make up remover but loved it so much that I replaced my facial toner with it. It has improved my skin appearence and makes my face feel great!</li>
    <li> This makes my face sooooo soft and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out. I got the unscented one, even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it didn&#x27;t irritate me what-so-ever. The bottle is big and I love the overall product. My face way less oily and my acne has dried up.</li>
    <li> Good alcohol free witch hazel</li>
    <li> This works so well my wife uses it.  It helps clear the leftover soap from my face when I use it after shaving and rinsing.  my wife suffers from skin redness and has been using it with success.  This bottle lasts a while so the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you got one review as an aftershave and another review for general face treatment since my wife has been stealing it!</li>
    <li> I use it as a facial lotion after cleansing my face.  I like it, but only 4 stars because I would have preferred it to be a little bit more &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;softening.&amp;#34;  Those qualities would have been a plus, but it does feel very refreshing when applied.  I put it in another bottle because I prefer to spray my facial lotions on my face rather than put them in my hands to apply.  It&#x27;s very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great.  Delivered on time as promised.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I just got today but i could not find expiration date anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( I don&#x27;t know if i could not find it or the code - CT 06881 means something?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is an fresh ingredients It must be lasts short period than others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel suspicious why they are hiding dates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see good reviews a lot , since it is cheap price I pass this time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i will not order again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; liquid products usually lasts only about 1 year as you open&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope lots of people more complain about this and make sure your product is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;reliable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and stopped using toners years ago because they caused more problems than they solved, probably due to the alcohol content.  Thayer&#x27;s alcohol-free with aloa is perfect for my skin.  I was still experience breakouts and have mild rosacea, but this has eliminated both conditions.  I use it on a cotton ball after every wash, and my skin looks fantastic.  It also helps alleviate puffiness under my eyes when I apply a cotton ball of it to each eye for a few minutes.  No more breakouts at all, and my skin looks terrific.  I&#x27;ve stopped using foundation as a result.  Highly recommended...check other products on the market and they frequently contain witch hazel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find alcohol free witch hazel.  This is a little more pricey but worth it if you need alcohol free.</li>
    <li> it is a wonderful product. Highly recommend to anyone looking to tone their skin naturally. Wonderful both the scented and unscented!!!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great toner for personal use or as an MUA to pack around this is a great product! Unscented which is ALWAYS a plus, witch hazel which has soothing and anti-inflammatory properties, and a great price for a lot of product! I use it personally and on makeup clients and love it!</li>
    <li> No alcohol.  No stinging or drying out of my face. Love this one the best.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this witch hazel to make sub burn spray and my own bug spray. It really doesn&#x27;t have a scent and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin with any residue. Definitely a much healthier option to all of the prodcuts out there full of chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried a few of the scents and they&#x27;re all good. I like the unscented one a lot because I&#x27;ll add my own essential oils to it. I have a vanilla lavender one that is the BEST face mist before bed!</li>
    <li> The best toner for your skin with harsh chemicals.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate it.  I make my own make up remover cloths with Thayers Witch Hazel and they work great.  One other friend used them at my house and now is ordering this product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great toner.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> I judge a toner by the amount of dirt that is on the cotton ball after I wash my face.  With this one, there was none, so I&#x27;m back to my former toner.</li>
    <li> Tones your skin very well and doesn&#x27;t dry it up. No smell, so you can decide what you smell like by your choice of cologne. Perfect.</li>
    <li> i believe this to be a very good product</li>
    <li> I love the way this toner feels on my face. I&#x27;ve used witch hazel for years but just discovered Thayers Alcohol-Free Toner.</li>
    <li> excellent product that is now part of my regular post shave process</li>
    <li> I bought this for my face and so far so good.  I don&#x27;t use this every night but so far I have not seen any issues.  it has not irritated my skin or made me break out any worse or any less.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use this as my toner in the morning after washing my face.</li>
    <li> Love it! Old fashion remedies work still in this day and age! Yay! Need to re-order soon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it after I shave my head and it is smooth and cools. Smells good like cucumber. The smell fades fast.</li>
    <li> I am a DE shaver and this product it fantastic. I love rubbing it on my face and neck after a shave. It feels so soothing.</li>
    <li> A wonderful medium for a homemade facial toner or bug spray. It truly has no scent. Easily absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it!</li>
    <li> unscented, really soothes your skin after a shave. I have been using this for 2+ years. They make it in various scents but i have not tried them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Witch Hazel astringent with 14% alcohol and decided to try Thayers alcohol-free unscented Witch Hazel  for a more pure product.  I normally use it on my face after showering for redness but the Thayers leaves a tacky residue.  It also left my skin a little irritated with a tingling sensation.  Some people may have no problem if they slather on the lotions and all those layers are normal for them.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff. It&#x27;s an amaxing product. It is clear, alcohol free, and scent free. Compared to other liquid witch hazel this does not leave a burning sensation to the skin. It applies smoothly, dries quickly, and works fast. I would definately buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Anyone with dry skin will really appreciate this version of Thayers Witch Hazel. I have that &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin, and on top of that live in a very dry climate. Most witch hazel products contain about 14% alcohol which would dry skin more. Instead, this contains no alcohol, AND it has aloe vera which is highly moisturizing. Witch hazel is wonderful as a facial cleanser and toner. I apply it with a cotton ball, after washing my face with a gentle moisturizing product. Being both unscented and  containing organic ingredients is another plus! I searched 6 drug stores for this version of Thayers and could not find it. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s gental and almost moisturizig. no alcohol so it&#x27;s not at all drying. witch hazel has been around for ever as a healing agent and this also contains aloe, what more can you ask for. i have oily skin and have the &#x27;horrid rosacea&#x27;. and did i say gental?lol</li>
    <li> This product worse great after a DE razor shave, cold cloth then the witch hazel, lotion and cologne. Great value, I use it on the road, just fill up an old 3oz hand sanitizer bottle, good to for airports and travel</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!! This product has MANY uses. I use at home, take it on trips, and even carry some in my purse at all times. Primarily, I use it to clean my face each morning, it&#x27;s gentle and the aloe is a great natural moisturizer. It keeps my oily skin in check and reduces acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great to use on minor cuts and abrasions, disinfecting without the sting like alcohol. I&#x27;ve also applied it to minor burns and experienced quick relief and healing. It&#x27;s great on bug bites, immediately reducing the sting and/or itchiness. (My neighbor&#x27;s son was stung by a bee and I gave them some of this witch hazel to put on it right away. It was immediately soothing and the next day it was almost completely healed!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also keep some in a small spray bottle to spritz on toilet tissue to make my own flushable wipes. The chemicals in brand wipes seem to be harsh and irritating (the wipes themselves I hear are not so good for sewer systems). This witch hazel is super gentle, the aloe is particularly helpful in soothing/healing a sore or tender bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen so many great uses for one simple product. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> It really makes my face feel so refreshed.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is allergic to scented products.</li>
    <li> This toner is perfect for those with sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve never experienced any breakouts, rashes, or stinging from the product whereas I have one to all of those reactions to most facial toners. I plan to continue purchasing Thayers witch hazel toners indefinitely.</li>
    <li> My wife told me about Thayer Brand and how highly &amp;#34;Green&amp;#34; it is rated by the Environmental Working Group.  It really helps to condition my skin.  It has a natural feel and really makes my shave complete.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually balances the ph in my face like my old toner, but it cleans pretty well without feeling that intense dryness of most toners. It&#x27;s been good so far.</li>
    <li> This is a great toner to remove makeup residue.  I read that witch hazel without alcohol helps wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The Aloe is good, but THE CUCUMBER IS PERFECT!... Great smell, fresh and cool on my cuts scrapes pierced ear cleaning, face toning and sons acne oil erradication!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 12 and have been on RXs including Accutane, since then. I&#x27;ve tried countless natural remedies, lotions, cleansers, toners, makeup. At 30 my derm told me that I have Acne Rosacea and put me on an antibiotic cream. So red patches plus white heads were my new look. Recently,  I stumbled upon this alcohol free witch hazel and started to use it morn and night after cleansing with an organic probiotic cleanser but before I put on my probiotic moisturizer (morn) or antibiotic cream (night). Within 2 days every white head was gone, my skin felt smooth as a baby and bright as a daisy!! I wish I had found this decades ago as it would&#x27;ve saved me bundles and lots of insecurity. Now I&#x27;m just waiting for some old sub surface spots to heal from picking and then I&#x27;ll book my Cover Girl photo shoot. Just kidding.</li>
    <li> I got this to mainly use it as an aftershave. It works very well as one, and doesn&#x27;t come with the burn. My acne also seems to greatly decrease after shaving and using this, so that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This is what I use for aftershave, instead of any of the scented stuff that&#x27;s out there. I wanted something that was unscented so it would not interfere with whatever cologne I chose to wear. This stuff is great - doesn&#x27;t burn either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battle with redness on my cheeks for most of my life. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and treatments, and sometimes it&#x27;s mild, but it&#x27;s always there. I&#x27;ve switched recently to more DIY beauty products and I saw more improvements than ever before, but I still had slightly red cheeks. When I tried this product it was almost like a transformation before my eyes. I could actually watch the redness disappear. My skin on my cheeks is the same color as the skin on my shoulders or my forehead now. It&#x27;s amazing. Where has this product been all of my life?!? I will be a life long customer. This stuff is amazing. My skin is softer, more even toned, and I&#x27;m breaking out less. I think you should stop reading reviews and just buy some already! ;)</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Terrific! It&#x27;s a great toner and a wonderful part of my eye makeup remover recipe.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin plus a sensitivity to perfumes so this is amazing! It&#x27;s alcohol free so your skin actually feels moisturized after you use it. It has helped tremendously with my acne!!</li>
    <li> I like that this toner has no alcohol or fragrance added, and it is fresh when used on your face. However, unlike other toners I have used in the past, this one doesn&#x27;t take off any additional dirt or makeup on your face. However, I used it separately to take off eye makeup, and it works well; but after washing your face I didn&#x27;t see anything else come off.</li>
    <li> this thayers alcohol-free witch hazel is really gentle to use on your sensitive skin pretty much!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t wait and just take it!</li>
    <li> product arrived on time, as expected</li>
    <li> I use this as toner and it minimizes a lot of redness and makes my skin very smooth. I use a cotton ball to apply to my face. I use Jason&#x27;s vitamin E oil after. It&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t want to live without anymore! I just bought 2 more as Christmas presents for my sisters.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone, oily t-zone, overall sensitive skin and this is an amazing addition to my routine. I saw immediate result. my skin looks much healthier than before. I like that it has no scent and it cools down your face when applying it.</li>
    <li> Great toner. I use it right after I wash my face and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> Love this product. More importantly, my very sensitive skin loves this product! No alcohol means no drying, YAY! Does everything it says and is supposed to do. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable for the price - great skin toner.</li>
    <li> It gives a cleaner feeling and it&#x27;s a lot better than those harsh alcohol toners that dry out your skin. I was hoping this would help clean the impurities off of my face. I&#x27;m not exactly sure if I&#x27;ve benefited from this product. I&#x27;m just glad it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> Alcohol free witch hazel.</li>
    <li> I like how its unscented, and it removes any leftover dead skin cells or dirt really well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results of some where my cotton pad is dirty after use, but is does leave my skin feeling more fresh and it hasn&#x27;t been as dry (yeah for no stinging alcohol in the ingredients.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find 100% pure Witch Hazel. Love it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a very timely manner. Reasonsble price, too. It is gentle on the skin and just as advertised; unscented. I&#x27;d definitely buy from this company again!</li>
    <li> i have been using Thayer Unscented Witch Hazel  twice daily after cleansing since i received it on july 19, and i&#x27;m not even a 1/4 into the bottle. i have very sensitive skin, it&#x27;s very red and usually irritated, and since using this product my redness has significantly reduced. this product is light and absorbs quickly into my skin (normal to slightly dry) it&#x27;s a great way to get any last trace of makeup or cleanser residue or hard water off of your face before you go in with serums and moisturizers. very happy with my purchase and would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Does not smell at all, great product cleared my face up wonderfully. I use it as a toner.</li>
    <li> High quality witch hazel. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I use it after I cleanse my face and also during the day if I need to freshen up.  I like the fact that is it unscented and alcohol free.  The fewer ingredients the better!</li>
    <li> Whaaat?!  I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I had to say something.  I bought the product to for my face (toner, fade dark marks, etc).  It&#x27;s only been 1.5 days so its a little early to tell...although it doesn&#x27;t dry/irritate my skin like alcohol or drug store witch hazel.  HOWEVER....about 30 minutes ago I noticed an itchy welt/inflammed area on my face, NOT from the product but I think it was a bug bite.  So I thought, hmmm....they say witch hazel reduces inflammation let me put some on and see if it helps.  Itching was soothed immediately. I watched some youtube videos and 30-45 min later I went to look in the mirror.  The signs of the bug bite was GONE.  I&#x27;m looking in the mirror thinking whaaaat?  I may understand where witch hazel got it&#x27;s name (now we know it&#x27;s science not magic).  I know what to pull out when mosquitoes attack me this summer.  Pretty cool!</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the bottle I smelled it.  Besides the faint scent of what I believe is aloe vera, there is no scent.  Ever since I started using this, the pores on my face have gotten smaller, I have better looking skin, my skin is more moisturized, and I am more youthful looking.  I had an arsenal of organic junk at my disposal, but after using this for a week I realized I had finally found the holy grail astringent.</li>
    <li> The bumpy area under my eyes has greatly improved by applying this product under my eyes once a day.  It has also greatly reduced the pores on my nose.  I really love it and intend to buy some for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I like this after shaving.</li>
    <li> Solid toner here. No alcohol, that&#x27;s important. Most of this stuff has alcohol. I use and aftershave if I want alcohol. If I shave before bed, I use this stuff. Invigorating and refreshing.</li>
    <li> The only other witch hazel I&#x27;ve tried was an off brand generic, and it&#x27;s no surprise that this stuff blows it out of the water! I use it as an aftershave, and it is soothing, cooling, and leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean, and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice or feel any difference after using thia product for about 2 months and stopping it.</li>
    <li> A great multi-purpose solution for skin. Makes an excellent toner.</li>
    <li> I was using this in place of hand sanitizer for a trip I took. It worked great, didn&#x27;t get sick even though the city was more than packed with people. Will purchase again for other trips!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it makes my oily skin feel normal and healthy not dry like some toners</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning (face, body parts) without drying. Many uses. Does not irritate since its alcohol free and Unscented.</li>
    <li> Better price than the drug store, soothing after shave, especially for bald heads..</li>
    <li> I have the unscented, alcohol free version.  Use AM and PM after face wash.  I have used 1/4 of the bottle in 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;It feels fresh on the skin without burning or tingling.  Does not dry out my combination skin.</li>
    <li> I use this after shaving and it&#x27;s fantastic.  No scent, no muss, heals great.  A little bit goes a long way and this is a big bottle of the stuff.  Just fantastic.</li>
    <li> My skin has always been very sensitive and a bit problematic. I always knew that witch hazel was great for problem skin, but couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. This stuff has been amazing. There is no smell whatsoever and my skin has looked and felt great since I began using it. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this again. It&#x27;s just too good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always known witch hazel is good for your skin, but never realized what benefits daily use could bring. Well, natural is best. This is a wonderful option for skin care. I had it for only a week and was so pleased with the results, that my 20 year old asked me to buy a bottle for her too. Here are both of our reactions:&lt;br /&gt;20 yr old - I wear a lot of makeup everyday. I began to have occasional small breakouts for the first time in my life and even some roughness on my face. I now use this everyday after I remove my makeup and my face is blemish free and soft. I also used it on a bit of an itchy rash on my arm and it has disappeared too.&lt;br /&gt;Me - I have older skin, of course. I use this in my evening routine. And if I&#x27;ve been working outside during the day, when I return to the house. My pores seemed to be tighter, and my skin more balanced...no more dry spots/oily areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion? This is a great buy and a wonderful product. I won&#x27;t be without it from now on.</li>
    <li> A favorite product -- has no alcohol which burns the skin.  This is amazing for so many different applications.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do..Nice facial toner great for sensitive skin..It does pour our fast so be careful but it is a great toner..Worth the price..</li>
    <li> I bought it as a new toner. It&#x27;s gentle on skin, but leaves my skin feeling a bit oily.</li>
    <li> Really great quality and healthful.&lt;br /&gt;Works for cleaning so many parts of the body with out drying skin out.</li>
    <li> Am making a homemade product that calls for this product. Witch Hazel has many uses from skin care, helping with bags under eyes, relief of itching from poison ivy etc. Works well.</li>
    <li> This product is a nice addition to any man&#x27;s wet shaving routine.  It is odorless, non-sticky and it protects the skin nicely.</li>
    <li> Well - if this is what it is supposed to be then great - but I have always noticed a witch hazel scent that I find pleasant enough.  This has absolutely no scent at all which almost makes me wonder if there is no active ingredient.</li>
    <li> Really helps hungary skin, I am happy I can find this again. My grandma used it and I see why</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I&#x27;ve made an excellent toner with it by adding Young Living Essential Oils. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Love, will order again. Does not sting at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intention of using it as an alcohol-free facial toner. I found that it is just too irritating for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am skeptical about this product being completely alcohol-free. The only way to make witch hazel extract is with some kind of alcohol (as far as I know). My skin reacted to this product similarly to how it reacts to alcohol based products.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will.  Helps soothe irritated skin and does not dry it out.</li>
    <li> The aloe added to this product makes it even better. I use it as a quick shower mixed with a little alcohol when camping without facilities.</li>
    <li> OMG love this toner.... amazing :-)</li>
    <li> It seems to clean well, yet it still leaves my skin feeling dry and sometimes breaks me out.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Non-drying to my skin. It&#x27;s the perfect toner after washing my face. I have combination skin and can sometimes skip moisturizer after applying this product.</li>
    <li> This toner does everything I need.  It tones, moisturizes, and makes my skin feel fresh.  Sometimes I feel I can skip moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, acne prone, oily skin.  This stuff seems to do a pretty good job of making my skin feel cleaner throughout a day.  My skin used to feel really oily and dirty as the day goes on, but this product has helped alleviate that. I apply this toner in the morning after using a cleanser.  I&#x27;d recommend and likely get a refill once i&#x27;m finished with the bottle.</li>
    <li> This toner has no scent, dries quickly, and is easy on my sensitive skin.  I have noticed an improvement in my skin compared to my more expensive toner.  I will continue to use this toner for a long time!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like smelly, alcohol based aftershave.  I keep a bottle right in the the shower to splash on after shaving.  disinfects and tones.  I get noticeably less razor rash.  Then I apply moisturizer.  Also, keep in mind that compared to the price of fancy men&#x27;s aftershave, this is quite a good deal</li>
    <li> I have tried several witch hazels and this one is my favorite due to:&lt;br /&gt;1) You get a lot of product for the money (value)&lt;br /&gt;2) The ingredients are a mixture of all-natural and organic stuff (nothing nasty!)&lt;br /&gt;3) It works great as a toner and anesthetic to help reduce acne</li>
    <li> Nice for making your own products you want to scent yourself. I used it for making hand sanitizer and added some essential oil specific for killing germs.</li>
    <li> I started using this as my aftershave.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find &amp;#34;minimal ingredient&amp;#34; health/beauty products, but my skin has not been burning/irritated like it sometimes will get with other, more chemical-laden after shave products (Gillette, Nivea, etc.).</li>
    <li> Am chemically sensitive, this product is fabulous for making hand sanitizer, make rashes ease up, etc...love it!</li>
    <li> Turning 30, I realized I needed to take care of my face. After some trial and error, and online research, I found that the three step cycle of washing, toning, and moisturizing is the best approach. The next problem is to find out which products to use. What I learned is that they sometimes don&#x27;t mix (dreadnought aftershave balm and neutrogena triple-protect face lotion does not mix), and that Neutrogena products don&#x27;t work well on my face. This was my next choice as a toner (after I tried Neutrogena skin toner) and it works great. It does have a smell, however, so please be warned. It goes away after a few minutes though. Also give it about 15 minutes to dry and soak into your face before you put lotion on. Otherwise, I approve.</li>
    <li> good for acne i think! not greasy or dry out my skin at all</li>
    <li> I think this product works.  I was using this for acne breakouts, and that made them lessen and go away.  So I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I use this with lime essential oil and it makes a great after shave</li>
    <li> Alcohol Free!  Hard to find!</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Thayer unscented witch hazel is a great skin toner. Most toners are scented, or contain alcohol. I cannot handle fragrance and I can&#x27;t tolerate alcohol anymore. So Thayer fit the bill. I use it after makeup removal and cleansing to get anything remaining and to soften the skin before moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle yet effective, and makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I have plaque psoriasis and I use this mixed with vegetable glycerin 50/50 to soothe my skin. Using this every day in a spray bottle I&#x27;ve started to see my psoriasis go away in patches, revealing healthy skin underneath. I&#x27;ve wasted too much money on pricey medical creams that do nothing for me. I&#x27;m surprised something as simple as mixing an anti-inflammatory with glycerin (a main ingredient in lotion) has improved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to use this every day and as often as possible or it doesn&#x27;t work for me...It works best after I exfoliate gently in the shower so it can reach my skin. It&#x27;s important to take a little time and rub it in like lotion. I like this one in particular because it DOES NOT have alcohol in it, as the alcohol burns and irritates my psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review doesn&#x27;t gross anyone out- I&#x27;m embarrassed talking about my skin disease. But I hope it helps someone else that&#x27;s on the fence get some relief. I recommend trying it if anyone else has psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I love all Thayers products and I have tried many. I am really glad to have found this unscented version of their alcohol free witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;It is sooo nice to use after a swim or a shower. It keeps your skin from getting that annoying tight feeling. It is not greasy or oily like most stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans, but really gently.&lt;br /&gt;It is also really great to use after shaving as it really helps your skin heal if you get a bit of razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Just squirt a little on a cotton ball, and use it on your whole face and neck.</li>
    <li> Great product, just as advertised.</li>
    <li> excellent price for an alcohol-free witch hazel for my super sensitive skin. it&#x27;s so moisturizing and refreshing! i&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and i&#x27;ve used about a quarter of it, so i consider that good value.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for us.  We tried it based on a friends recommendation.  For us it did nothing, just like using water.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else...I use this for a quick clean at night and as a toner after I wash. Never dries out your skin, makes it feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, skin and it is alcohol free. Part of my daily skin regime. So far I am happy with this toner. I am going to get my second one. But is is cheaper at the local store.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Like that it is unscented.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend really likes this witch hazel and she told me she would get it again this is very high coming from her she has  high standards</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a after shower facial toner and have just finished a bottle (12 ounce). I&#x27;m happy that this is alcohol free and has its own unique formulae with a trusted legacy. This is a great spritz toner on the go which refreshes my skin and offers much needed moisture and calms the skin too. I use this before and after my weekly derma roller treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value for money and I have just purchased another 4 bottles.</li>
    <li> I have to say something here. My wife bought this for her. But this stuff is like magic I ever use it on myself</li>
    <li> Great unscented and non alcoholic witch hazel!  Fair warning though, aloe vera is listed ahead of witch hazel in the ingredient list.  Overall as a part of my aftershave regimen this product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel for a couple of years, and it&#x27;s great on my skin. I had always bought the rose scent, but the unscented was priced better and the rose scent goes away when the witch hazel dries on my skin anyway.</li>
    <li> I already know this stuff is good, but the price is very reasonable on amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Gentle on my face and takes off any remaining make up left on my face after I use my face wash.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Product came quickly. Will be used for padsicles post pregnancy. Smells like typical witch hazel and appears pure.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product whose description matches it&#x27;s content. Alcohol free and gentle. Just be careful, some people break out with Aloe Vera naturally.</li>
    <li> I like that this is unscented.  It makes a good base for homemade toners and serums.</li>
    <li> I purchased this witch hazel to use in a DIY healthy deodorant.  It performs as expected and is much less expensive as many others on the market.  I will reorder without reservation.</li>
    <li> The rose type is better, softer and less irritating. This type made my skin more irritation prone. Not gonna buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was using rubbing alcohol as toner.  This isn&#x27;t as harsh, but it&#x27;s still effective.</li>
    <li> Use this on my golden, works well on minor skin irritation/infection and for cleaning his ears. Alcohol free is good, just not quite as strong an astringent. Good thing they make it both ways.</li>
    <li> I wash my face first and then cleanse with this toner every night and it really removes all the dirt and make up. It stings a little, but it isn&#x27;t unbearable. Face feels squeeky clean and soft after. It does dry up your face a bit so definitely recommend moisturizing after.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it has improved my skin!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I has cleared my skin, helped tattoos heal faster, helped dry skin. I am buying this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy that gets terrible ingrown hairs when i shave my neck.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;i use a cotton pad and apply generously to my neck and face.&lt;br /&gt;Really cleaned up my neck and now people are commenting on how smooth and even colored my complexion looks! Bonus!</li>
    <li> I used another brand of witch hazel toner while I was pregnant and had the most radiant, blemish free skin.  I mistakenly thought it was due to an alpha hydroxy face cream I had used during that time, but recently realized that it might have been the witch hazel instead.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this because of the wonderful reviews, and because of it being alcohol and fragrance free.  I have extremely oily skin at times, but don&#x27;t like to aggravate that by stripping it dry with alcohol.  It truly is fragrance free, unlike all other witch hazels I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with acne since I hit puberty, except for when I used witch hazel while pregnant.  Don&#x27;t ask me why I didn&#x27;t realize this cured me sooner--I thought it was the pregnancy hormones making my skin better.  Sometimes it&#x27;s better than other times, but lately even my usual, more expensive cures for pimples have not been working.&lt;br /&gt;I received this from Amazon the other day and within ONE USE, my few pimples have withered and faded.  I will never ever not use this stuff ever again!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on those expensive, harsh acne treatments.  THIS IS A MIRACLE WORKER for sensitive, acne prone skin.  I don&#x27;t understand why my dermatologists never recommended it...maybe because they can&#x27;t make a profit.</li>
    <li> I am soooo happy I found this stuff! I saw a post on Pinterest touting the benefits of witch hazel and then I saw all the positive reviews on here and decided to give it a whirl. After just 1 week, my skin has cleared, and is visibly fresher/firmer. My relatives are asking me my secret. After suffering from blackheads, pimples and hair bumps constantly since I was 12, at 30 (and after having 2 kids) it is a RELIEF to have clear skin! The aloe in it helps to moisturize but doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I want to try some of their other products, because I am just so pleased with the results of this Thayer Witch Hazel!</li>
    <li> First time buying non alcohol Witch Hazel, I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling. Will buy again! Living in Alaska it&#x27;s great to get things at a better price than in the Natural stores up here!</li>
    <li> Thayer Unscented Witch Hazel, 12 Fluid Ounce WITH ALOE VERA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t say that in the heading.  it IS on the bottle though, which, if I had it in hand, I&#x27;d put back on the shelf but for some reason, seeing a list of Unscented Witch Hazel products on my iPhone&#x27;s small screen I clicked on the wrong one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are allergic/sensitive to aloe, the addition of this emollient will defeat the purpose of using the witch hazel.  Really, who ever got the bright idea of putting Aloe Vera in everything.  Had to look for an hour to find a brand of hydrocortisone cream that was made without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for JUST &amp;#34;witch hazel&amp;#34; extract, keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure my wife can use it so it won&#x27;t be a total waste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to use this product. Again and again I see Thayer Witch Hazel recommended as a toner. I had gotten the rose scented Thayer, but had a bad reaction to it. Face and neck rash is no fun at all. So I got the unscented hoping that go better with my sensitive skin, and PERFECT! I&#x27;ve been using for several months now after using a facial cleanser then I follow with moisturizer. It&#x27;s a great part of my routine.</li>
    <li> We love this product and it&#x27;s versatility.  OxKom was timely in sending the product as advertised.  My only criticism is that, while the bottles I received were sealed well, one bottle had been leaked on by another product at some point.  The presentation was hampered, thought the quality of the product was fine.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and this product is perfect.  Most astringents are too harsh for my skin, but this doesn&#x27;t suck upevery last bit of moisture. I can even use it on my eyelids, which react negatively to just about anything, with no ill effects.  Leaves your face feeling very clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a great toner</li>
    <li> The only toner that works for me. Cleared up my acne within days! Also tightens pores... Love it!!</li>
    <li> i really dislike what happens to my face after shaving... but this product really cools off the burn and tones my skin... best of all it is natural.... wish i knew about this 10 years ago</li>
    <li> I was concerned that the witch hazel scent might be strong even though the description said unscented. It is not--just as described and arrived in excellent condition and quickly.</li>
    <li> Organic, unscented, and natural.  It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.  My skin is softer, smoother, and feels better than ever after using this.</li>
    <li> This is such a simple toner w/o additives or fragrance. I have bought toners that cost 3xs the cost that didn&#x27;t have half the product included in it. I&#x27;m hooked for life. So good!~</li>
    <li> Love the fact that this is unscented as well as that it has aloe in it to prevent drying. Use this in several essential oil recipes.</li>
    <li> I have never used witch hazel before. I find this has great feel when applied and leaves my skin feeling very clean. It&#x27;s great at reducing irritation as well. It has no fragrance and feels just like clean water. A really good find!</li>
    <li> For all the wet shavers out there, here is your tonic.  Unscented and safe on skin.  Put it in a spritzer bottle and spray all over face and neck then slap yourself silly.  Man, that feels good!</li>
    <li> A non-descript product that does what it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No cloying smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Even more importantly, my daughter -- who has proven to be allergic to just about every after-shave product I have used in the past -- doesn&#x27;t even realize I am using it.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin that easily becomes dry... This soothes my skin and never leaves if feel dry. Also love that this is a natural product. A++++</li>
    <li> Nothing great or wrong with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to diminish the look of my large pores on my nose area.  I have also noticed a reduction in t-zone oiliness after using this morning and night for weeks.  It feels nice, it&#x27;s not sticky or tight-feeling, and it has no scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it in the morning after I wash my face and before moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling and looking great all day. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It worked well for my bug spray mix. I did find it cheaper in a store. So I will be getting it from there now on.</li>
    <li> A natural and healthy way to tone your skin. I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Got it for itchy dog paws, it&#x27;s supposed to help balance yeast levels and provide relief for itchy pads on her paws. Seems to be helping!</li>
    <li> I have been making my own body products &amp; I just hate the smell of witch hazel. I am SO glad I found this one! It does not stink!</li>
    <li> Nice and pure product.  Great for use in our homemade deodorant.</li>
    <li> I use this Witch Hazel as an aftershave for my face.  I recently have been getting into double edge wet shaving and needed a good product to astringe any open knicks, disinfect the face, and not leave it dry.  I also purchased an Alum Block as well and I have to say that I prefer this to the alum block.  The only thing that the alum block does that this product does not do is provide that little bit of sting to the skin which you sometimes need for good facial feedback.  This stuff is truly non-scented and splashes on nicely without needing too much of it.  After I get done shaving I rinse my face with cold water to get any shave foam off.  With my face still wet I splash some of this witch hazel on and it astringes any knicks and does not dry out my face at all.  Splash on some aftershave lotion, pat dry and I&#x27;m good to go.  Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> My Irish mom always was putting witch hazel on me, and it always worked, for everything. I now use this product (and the rose petal one especially) as my main medicine cabinet item. I rely on it so much. It&#x27;s the best. Simple, clean ingredients, truly a natural product, one our grandmothers used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, I think this company must have gotten bought out a few years ago, because the prices suddenly about doubled. It always happens to the good, simple stuff. Someone buys it out and takes over and now the whole purpose seems to be to make a ton of dough. I&#x27;d love to be wrong here...</li>
    <li> Finally ! A Thayer&#x27;s that DOESN&#x27;T Have synthetic fragrance !! Don&#x27;t be duped by the rose or the lavender varieties . They say &amp;#34;fragrance natural lavender/rose&amp;#34; but they aren&#x27;t essential oils or anything, they are artificial fragrances ! I hate how they try to deceive buyers because they seem like a natural product. I love this stuff, no alcohol either .</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day as a toner and I like it a lot.  I just prefer the rose petal witch hazel - it feels better on my skin.  This seemed to dry it out a little bit more.</li>
    <li> This contains the right type of witch hazel, which is non-irritating. Alcohol-free is a plus. This really soothes the skin and if you have oily skin, it adds just enough moisture, but leaves the skin feeling clean. I love the smell of witch hazel. I know some people don&#x27;t, but if you like herbal, clean smells, you may like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have a bottle on hand as a back up. Great for quick lotion masks. Great for thinning skin care. If your moisturizer is too heavy, try adding a little of this.</li>
    <li> I used this before, and it was great for my skin. I used it as a toner and it leaves smooth and clean. I bought two, one for me and one for my friend.</li>
    <li> Standard, wonderful Witch Hazel without additives or allergens to make me itchy.</li>
    <li> Have used Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel for years...it is an excellent product.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have read so many reviews and had to try this. I have a  lot of blemishes and some dark spots on my face. My Skin is dry and gets irritated easy. I have been using this for only a few days now and  so far I can say my face looks a lot smoother. Blemishes don&#x27;t seem that noticeable. My face hasn&#x27;t been dry and it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Would highly recommend this brand over general store brand witch hazel.</li>
    <li> Like most things, it&#x27;s not really &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but not so great either. It left a sticky feeling on my skin, but didn&#x27;t dry out or burn my skin, but I didn&#x27;t see much of an improvement in my skin either.</li>
    <li> This product has definitely helped keep my skin clear and is good for sensitive skin. When using it I can feel it lightly moisturizing my skin as well as helping to tighten a little. It has a very light, soft aloe scent, but I want to emphasize I can tell that is from the natural aloe in the product and it is indeed fragrance free. I apply this to my face after cleansing and while my face is still moist from the toner I apply my serum, which I can tell absorbs better into my face when I use this method as opposed to applying it to my dry face. I will be repurchasing. Also, a note on packaging- I was worried about this leaking in transit but I opened up my box to see that not only did it have two security seals (one over the whole cap and one underneath the cap on the opening) but it was in its own sealed bag (seller was amazon.com.)</li>
    <li> I found this to use in my pre-wedding face/acne skincare regime. I had tried using organic apple cider vinegar as toner/makeup remover, but this is WAY better for my skin. I don&#x27;t break out with this. The bottle lasts me about 1.5-2 months. I used it after washing my face (with nubian heritage african black soap bar). I use it when I feel too oily and after working out and as makeup remover. I mix a squirt of sweet almond oil on a swissper pad with this toner for great easy makeup remover (even waterproof mascara and eyeshadow, etc). It feels very refreshing and the ingredients are very good (I look up all chemicals I use on the ewg.org/skindeep database). Sometimes I use this instead of washing my face to avoid overdrying. I had been using the Sibu daytime moisturizer after washing my face twice a day but I find that using this toner instead keeps me moisturized and a bit less oily than with the Sibu that often, though I do use the Sibu still just less often. I am very glad they finally made this toner in unscented as the scented options have unknown/bad chemicals in them (check ewg&#x27;s database before buying products!).</li>
    <li> Here is the best information you will ever get from an experienced wet shaver. If you purchase the UNSCENTED Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel, all you need to do is remove about 1/2 - 1 oz from the bottle. Then add 1-2 eye droppers of your favorite cologne or high end after shave. Shake it up, let it sit about an hour (or until your next shave) and you will have a 12 oz bottle that smells just like the scent you put into the bottle. For example, if you add 1 oz of Czeck &amp; Speake &amp;#34;Cuba&amp;#34; ( $120 for 4 oz.) you will end up with 12 oz for about $10. But you must use the UNSCENTED witch hazel. I just add samplers to the Thayer&#x27;s bottle and it works wonderfully. Try it!</li>
    <li> Just started using this, but I swear that it&#x27;s already helping shrink my pores. I like that it is very gentle and non-drying.</li>
    <li> I really like it, takes away bugbite itch very quickly:)</li>
    <li> I am using this to soften the puffiness around my eyes in the mornings.  It gives me a refreshing feeling and does the trick.  Puffiness is gone.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing toner. I can see the oil and grime from my face on the cotton ball after I use this. I feel that it is good for my skin and I can already tell a difference in just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Amazing - this helped my skin since day one. It&#x27;s great when you try a product and you can actually see the difference.</li>
    <li> This is great! Pure, without alcohol, it&#x27;s great to sooth a dogs skin after I get them groomed!</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin. Even for dry skin, it works great! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This toner is good for a quick cleanse during the day – however, I prefer to use an anti aging toner with vitamin c, etc in it, so I also use the skingenixx anti aging toner [[ASIN:B00VS7WQ8I Skingenixx Anti-Aging Facial Toner with Vitamin C, Glycolic Acid and Aloe Vera]] every day as well.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and just as I expected!</li>
    <li> Not that I have a lot of experience, but like to mix my own products for handwashing.  I was surprised that it lasted as long as it did.</li>
    <li> This witch hazel really is *unscented*. It has no smell at all!! It is of great quality and alcohol free. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> soothes without drying</li>
    <li> Love that it is alchohol free!  Smoothing and fragrance-free!</li>
    <li> Love waking up and using this on my face. So refreshing!</li>
    <li> Greatest after shave ever! I put it in a spray bottle and spray my face after shaving and it is fantastic! It treats razor burn, bumps, and redness. It also moisturizes, probably due to the aloe. It is a must buy if you have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Alcohol-free and unscented.  It makes a great aftershave.  I enhance mine with a little cologne in my palm and a squirt of this stuff.  Brilliant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll tell the truth...I don&#x27;t really &#x27;get&#x27; the toner thing but, if I&#x27;m going to use toner, I want my face to feel like I put something on it.  I like that tight, tingly feeling.  Unfortunately, this feels like I just wiped my face with water.</li>
    <li> I chose an alcohol-free brand because I did not want to have the stinging and the drying side effects. This was a very good brand. It did not leave a greasy feeling like some of the others, is almost fragrance free (very mild) and is comparable in cost if not cheaper than some brands with harsher ingredients. I am very happy with this brand.</li>
    <li> Non stinging and feels great!</li>
    <li> bought this for my mom to help with her red cheeks. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved using witch hazel.....well, that is, til I got old :-(  But this stuff is terrific.  Great toner and oh so gentle.  With this I can have my skin feel really clean but not stripped.  Doesn&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
