      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>Great deal</li>
      <li>This shampoo is great.  </li>
      <li>This works great to remove build up from hair.  </li>
      <li>This vendor had an excellent price and it shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>All in all a nice product.</li>
      <li>It made my hair feel very clean!  </li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprise to find it is the same formula and what a great price.  </li>
      <li>Love being able to order it online.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Love the product and have used it once a week for years.  </li>
      <li>I have to use a lot of product on my fine, straight hair to have any kind of structured style.  </li>
      <li>The baking soda and molasses are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Great for a deep clean followed by the Recovery Conditioner product also by Abba.</li>
      <li>After several weeks, my hair has returned to the nice silver look!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still true that I do not care for the \\&quot;molasses\\&quot; smell, after giving it another try...</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and love the results; no residue left on hair from minerals in water; strips the hair of any minerals that might be in your water supply yet leaves color-tint alone.  </li>
      <li>I love Abba products as they are natural and Vegan.  </li>
      <li>Awesome shampoo, I will never switch back to my other after using this product</li>
      <li>I will definitely be back to purchase more.  </li>
      <li>: When I first reviewed this product, I indicated that I did not like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It worked good the first time I used it and the second time I used it, my hair was a ball of tangled up knots that took weeks to get back to normal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other top of the line products and simply fell in love with ABBA&#x27;s pure moisture conditioner, pure detox shampoo, and pure recovery conditioner as my hair care regimen.  </li>
      <li>Not so with ABBA pure detox.  </li>
      <li>The only way I got it back to normal was to to pack on the mayonnaise and let it soak in for 15 min, use a good moisturizing shampoo and rinse with vinegar.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually had some new hair growth since I&#x27;ve started using it and my hair is stronger for sure.</li>
      <li>But that wasn&#x27;t too much of a surprise considering it is a detox shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Really cleans hair well.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is the only reasonable place I can find to purchase Abba products; don&#x27;t discontinue them!!!</li>
      <li>I only have to lather my hair with Abba Detox Shampoo once, leaving it on for a minute or two, and when it rinses off, my hair is squeaky clean without over-drying my hair.</li>
      <li>and I saw this for a few dollars more</li>
      <li>I love this line of hair products and they are hard to find in my town, for decent prices.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast and efficient shipping even through the Christmas holiday season.</li>
      <li>After using many hair products to rid my hair of that green-yellow look from too much sun and hard water, I resorted to Abba Detox.  </li>
      <li>It is in concentrated form so you use very little and this bottle will last more than a year with frequent shampooing.  </li>
      <li>pure detox shampoo clarifies and removes product buildup and hard water deposits from my hair and leaves my scalp feeling healthy and &amp;#34;happy.&amp;#34;  Other shampoo products make may scalp itchy and coated.  </li>
      <li>My hair and scalp are so much healthier than they ever were with other products.  </li>

    <li> Awesome shampoo, I will never switch back to my other after using this product</li>
    <li> Abba is the only shampoo I have found that gets the chlorine out of my hair without either weighing it down with conditioners or stripping it.</li>
    <li> I love this line of hair products and they are hard to find in my town, for decent prices.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast and efficient shipping even through the Christmas holiday season.</li>
    <li> I swim a lot, so I need a shampoo with ingredients to remove the minerals from my hair.  This shampoo does the trick, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feet stiff as it did before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I chose this shampoo because my hair goes through quite a bit every day.  This product works great!  It made my hair feel very clean!  The baking soda and molasses are fantastic.  Only downside is it did seem to dry my hair out a little bit.  But that wasn&#x27;t too much of a surprise considering it is a detox shampoo.  All in all a nice product.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived just as promised.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great.  It smells great and you can actually feel it tingle on your scalp.  I&#x27;ve actually had some new hair growth since I&#x27;ve started using it and my hair is stronger for sure.</li>
    <li> Really cleans hair well.  Doesn&#x27;t contain &amp;#34;conditioners&amp;#34; which can weigh down hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for several years once a week. I like what it does for my scalp and hair. It had become difficult to find and got expensive.  This vendor had an excellent price and it shipped quickly. I will definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> Great deal but I was sent an older version of the product without the ProQuinoa Complex. It worked good the first time I used it and the second time I used it, my hair was a ball of tangled up knots that took weeks to get back to normal. The shampoo is hard to rinse out and sticks in your hair like glue. The only way I got it back to normal was to to pack on the mayonnaise and let it soak in for 15 min, use a good moisturizing shampoo and rinse with vinegar. What a total nightmare that was.</li>
    <li> EDITED/UPDATED 3/2/14: When I first reviewed this product, I indicated that I did not like this shampoo. It&#x27;s still true that I do not care for the \\&quot;molasses\\&quot; smell, after giving it another try...it actually did remove the chemical smell from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The key in making it work is to leave it in your hair for at least 30 minutes (in my case). If you manage to do this, it does perform as advertised!</li>
    <li> Love the product and have used it once a week for years.  Had difficulty finding in local stores as they always seemed to be out of stock.  Great for a deep clean followed by the Recovery Conditioner product also by Abba.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the ABBA hair care line while in cosmetology school in the 90&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve tried other top of the line products and simply fell in love with ABBA&#x27;s pure moisture conditioner, pure detox shampoo, and pure recovery conditioner as my hair care regimen.  My hair and scalp are so much healthier than they ever were with other products.  ABBA pure detox shampoo clarifies and removes product buildup and hard water deposits from my hair and leaves my scalp feeling healthy and &amp;#34;happy.&amp;#34;  Other shampoo products make may scalp itchy and coated.  Not so with ABBA pure detox.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> After using many hair products to rid my hair of that green-yellow look from too much sun and hard water, I resorted to Abba Detox.  After several weeks, my hair has returned to the nice silver look!</li>
    <li> Beauty brands stop selling this and I have had to buy the last two bottles on amazon.  The price has gone up on the smaller bottles and I saw this for a few dollars more and I was hesitant but I was pleasantly surprise to find it is the same formula and what a great price.  I will definitely be back to purchase more.  I love Abba products as they are natural and Vegan.  This works great to remove build up from hair.  LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and love the results; no residue left on hair from minerals in water; strips the hair of any minerals that might be in your water supply yet leaves color-tint alone.  I have used hair coloring for years and this shampoo does not affect that.  It is in concentrated form so you use very little and this bottle will last more than a year with frequent shampooing.  Amazon is the only reasonable place I can find to purchase Abba products; don&#x27;t discontinue them!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years but always had to buy it from my hairdresser.  Love being able to order it online.</li>
    <li> This is the best clarifying shampoo I have ever used.  I have to use a lot of product on my fine, straight hair to have any kind of structured style.  I only have to lather my hair with Abba Detox Shampoo once, leaving it on for a minute or two, and when it rinses off, my hair is squeaky clean without over-drying my hair.</li>
