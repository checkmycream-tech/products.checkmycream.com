### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best part about Alexandra Spray Essence is you still have fragrance at 7:00 pm even though you put it on at 7:00 am.</li>
      <li>If that is the case, they will have substituted ingredients in order to maintain and ensure the quality and scent to which their customers are accustomed as best they can.</li>
      <li>and  I am so very happy to find it again.</li>
      <li>My mother in law loved it.</li>
      <li>The original Alexandra was wonderful and lingered throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It was very distinctive and perfect for my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>I do not deal with those kind of suppliers.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite perfumes, and so glad to find it on Amazon at a good price.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume, have used it for years.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is just wonderful, and is lasting in time all day.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad to have it again</li>
      <li>I love Alexandra by Alexandra de Markoff  because it has a wonderful lasting scent.</li>
      <li>Somebody please listen and bring back the original!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this for over 20 years, and thIs smells more like cologne.</li>
      <li>Alexandra is a wonderfully woodsy and grassy mix that melds itself to the individual&#x27;s body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>I have worn this for 50 years and still love it.</li>
      <li>product arrived in condition as expected... perfect.</li>
      <li>I have worn this wonderful perfume for some 30 odd years....</li>
      <li>Strength of fragrance is not as strong as original fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I supplied the lot number from the bottom of the bottle and they confirmed it.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I like the newer version, the older one was what I was used to for many years and like better.  </li>
      <li>This bears no resemblance to the original Alexandra.</li>
      <li>It is her favorite perfume, this is the real thing</li>
      <li>I always loved the product back in 1990&#x27;s</li>
      <li>it is a good  second</li>
      <li>They gave me a full refund.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I finally found a reliable source for my favorite fragrance.....</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>I agree with the previous writers, this is a great fragrance.</li>
      <li>I would strongly suggest it to ladies over 25 who are looking for something new without spending a fortune</li>
      <li>The box looks similar and the bottle, BUT the scent is very very sweet!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Due to FDA regulations and restrictions (in particular regarding the inclusion and content of animal-derived ingredients, which used to be very popular), the fragrance manufacturer itself may have had to change their formula slightly to remain compliant.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever had any problem with a product sold on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and it NEVER fails to impress.</li>
      <li>This is nice but not special.</li>
      <li>Fast service and perfume was just as my wife remembered it.  </li>
      <li>I really like this fragrance a lot.</li>
      <li>do not inderstand why we cannot find or purchase the real deal.  </li>
      <li>I do not understand why we cannot find or purchase the real deal....</li>
      <li>Definitely not the original essence mist.</li>
      <li>This IS a new formula!  </li>
      <li>people will let the company know that we want our fragrance back  it would be well worth a price increase just to have the real thing again.</li>
      <li>I have been buying this particular fragrance for years.</li>
      <li>I called Amazon and they were very professional!  </li>
      <li>so obviously I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Bottle top did not secure the bottle, therefore, fragrance leaked on to box.</li>
      <li>Never too heavy - just light and fresh..perfect for blondes!</li>
      <li>I purchased this and paid retail at Macy&#x27;s for years, so Amazon is my new place to buy it.</li>
      <li>I do not really believe it is real Alexandra!  </li>
      <li>Doesnt do well after it sits a while, apparently.</li>
      <li>But, since it was sold to Revelon in the early 2000&#x27;s it has never had the same fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The batch this perfume came from seems pretty watered down.</li>
      <li>Smells old and flat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The best part about Alexandra Spray Essence is you still have fragrance at 7:00 pm even though you put it on at 7:00 am. It stays with you. It is the only fragrance that people stop me and say, \\&quot;What is that fragrance?\\&quot;  I wish it was easier to find. It seems I am always searching for a deal. You will think you have a supplier and the next time you order it has gone up $10. I do not deal with those kind of suppliers. I keep hunting until I find one and pay the price that I want to pay.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I finally found a reliable source for my favorite fragrance.....and it&#x27;s not a knock off.  Alexandra is a wonderfully woodsy and grassy mix that melds itself to the individual&#x27;s body chemistry.  It has been my signature fragrance for 30 years so obviously I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance a lot.</li>
    <li> I have used Alexandra since 1999.  It was the only fragrance I wore and received complements daily.  But, since it was sold to Revelon in the early 2000&#x27;s it has never had the same fragrance.  I still use it but, I&#x27;m hoping&lt;br /&gt;enough people will let the company know that we want our fragrance back  it would be well worth a price increase just to have the real thing again.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this essence mist for over 25 years and the lot that came was NOT what I usually wear.  Definitely not the original essence mist.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous writers, this is a great fragrance. I hope it has not been discontinued because I&#x27;ve been wearing Alexandra for over 20 years and it NEVER fails to impress. Every time I wear this fragrance at least three people will ask me what I am wearing. This fragrance will last forever without being overpowering. I can still smell it sometimes even after having washed my clothing. I would strongly suggest it to ladies over 25 who are looking for something new without spending a fortune and/or doesn&#x27;t want to smell like eveyone else at the party.</li>
    <li> the wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> I love Alexandra by Alexandra de Markoff  because it has a wonderful lasting scent. I&#x27;ve used it for years and was recommended to me by my Mother ( now deceased). My Mother wore Enigma which is also lovely,but Alexandra is definitely my scent.&lt;br /&gt;I  used Alexandra de Markoff  products  for years until it was taken off the market,which was very disappointing  and  I am so very happy to find it again. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I have worn and purchased Alexandra for twenty five years.  I have a college degree in Retail Management.  I bought it from Lord and Taylor for years.  This is a FAKE!  The box looks similar and the bottle, BUT the scent is very very sweet!  It is not the spicy, sultry scent of Alexandra, by Alexandra de Markoff.  I called Amazon and they were very professional!  They gave me a full refund.  This is the first time I have ever had any problem with a product sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Fast service and perfume was just as my wife remembered it.  It is her favorite perfume, this is the real thing</li>
    <li> I have been out of my perfume for a while, The store that I usually purchase from has gone out of business.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t smell at all like the one I had been given by a friend previously.  Very heavy and old-lady like scent.</li>
    <li> My mother in law loved it.</li>
    <li> product arrived in condition as expected... perfect.</li>
    <li> I have worn  Alexandra for a lot of years and when I received this bottle the smell was totally different.  I am very disappointed in this one.  Sandra Meyer</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance. I have been buying this particular fragrance for years. It is  always on my  Christmas list.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes, and so glad to find it on Amazon at a good price. I purchased this and paid retail at Macy&#x27;s for years, so Amazon is my new place to buy it. The fragrance is just wonderful, and is lasting in time all day. I love it.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not the same as it use to be. The original Alexandra was wonderful and lingered throughout the day. It was very distinctive and perfect for my body chemistry. This is nice but not special.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for 50 years and still love it. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This IS a new formula!  After contacting the Alexandra de Markoff company to find out if the bottle I had purchased was indeed the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;, they informed me that it was.  I supplied the lot number from the bottom of the bottle and they confirmed it.  They also told me the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Due to FDA regulations and restrictions (in particular regarding the inclusion and content of animal-derived ingredients, which used to be very popular), the fragrance manufacturer itself may have had to change their formula slightly to remain compliant. If that is the case, they will have substituted ingredients in order to maintain and ensure the quality and scent to which their customers are accustomed as best they can. This may be why you have noticed slight changes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I like the newer version, the older one was what I was used to for many years and like better.  The newer one is slightly sweeter and a bit less exotic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps others in making their purchase decision!</li>
    <li> it is not the same scent as the original----but it is a good  second...I do not understand why we cannot find or purchase the real deal....I have worn this wonderful perfume for some 30 odd years....do not inderstand why we cannot find or purchase the real deal.  It is the only perfume that I have worn where people have stopped me in stores or airport to find out the name of the fragrance that I am wearing..Somebody please listen and bring back the original!!!!!!!!!! Thank you ,Judith M.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for 17 years...I always get compliments on it.  Never too heavy - just light and fresh..perfect for blondes!</li>
    <li> Been looking for this  So glad to have it again</li>
    <li> Smells old and flat. This is not the scent that I am used to. Doesnt do well after it sits a while, apparently.</li>
    <li> Fabulous scent. I have been wearing this for over 25 years and always get complimented on it.</li>
    <li> Not pleased with this Alexandra essence mist does not smell like the Alexandra I have ordered for years will not ord this agn.</li>
    <li> I did not receive what I ordered.  Because the cologne spray scent is not similar to Enigma, I don&#x27;t expect the Essence Mist Spray to be any different.  I have not tried it yet because I will probably return it.</li>
    <li> I,ve worn  it for years, but it is no longer sold in Memphis…..guess I&#x27;ll just have to buy it from you!</li>
    <li> I do not really believe it is real Alexandra!  It is made by someone I don&#x27;t recognize, Alexandra De Markoff.</li>
    <li> I ordered this fragrance in error....I intended to get Enigma.  The fragrance is NOTHING like Enigma, which I have used for over 40 years.</li>
    <li> I always loved the product back in 1990&#x27;s I smelled it and I love it. I will never buy anything else</li>
    <li> o.k. but does seem like a knock off and not like the ones in the department stores.</li>
    <li> Strength of fragrance is not as strong as original fragrance.  Bottle top did not secure the bottle, therefore, fragrance leaked on to box.</li>
    <li> The batch this perfume came from seems pretty watered down. I&#x27;ve been buying this for over 20 years, and thIs smells more like cologne. Doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I wore both Alexandra and Enigma years ago. This bears no resemblance to the original Alexandra.</li>
