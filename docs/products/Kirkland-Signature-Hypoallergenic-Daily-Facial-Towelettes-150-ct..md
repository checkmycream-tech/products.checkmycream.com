      <li>Very good price for the amount you get.  </li>
      <li>Good value!</li>
      <li>And good for my skin!</li>
      <li>They are great and don&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great deal and has great quality.</li>
      <li>They are of a great size and do not cause any problems with my skin.  </li>

      <li>I absolutely love these wipes!</li>
      <li>These come in packs of 15 which is AMAZING to keep from drying out and leave in my travel bag/at gym.</li>
      <li>However, this towelette has proven to be effective and non-irritating.</li>
      <li>Not as &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>These wipes are very good and compare to higher priced brand.</li>
      <li>you just wear foundation or wear no makeup, I&#x27;d go for these, but if you want to remove eye makeup I&#x27;d avoid these until Kirkland makes an even gentler, more effective formula.</li>
      <li>This is a great value -- and it keeps me from having to go to Costco...which makes it worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Best makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and good product</li>
      <li>and I can get all of my makeup off and then wipe my face to make sure it&#x27;s all off.</li>
      <li>These work very well and are at a great price compared to like products you can find in a drug store.</li>
      <li>You also get way more than 150 now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love these.  </li>

      <li>You get tons and tons of these and they are wider than normal wipes which is great.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use them all, which was good, because once my 15 yr old Granddaughter got hold of them, she fell in love with them for removing her make-up!</li>
      <li>I bought this mostly to remove my makeup easily.</li>
      <li>These wipes are HUGE and fantastic!</li>

      <li>Best, hands down, make up remover out there.  </li>
      <li>I was just using the Neutrogena eye make up remover, and while that worked fine, I prefer these wipes.</li>
      <li>These are the best facial tissues and reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping was quick!</li>
      <li>They smell clean and one side has raised bumps so that it can clean better.</li>
      <li>They are a generous size and the dual sided textures are great for facial and eye make-up removal.  </li>
      <li>This brand is amazing, though it is much, MUCH cheaper at Costco.</li>
      <li>Great for removing makeup and also for traveling with the smaller packs.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use these and the value is fantastic.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for facial towellets these are great.</li>
      <li>I did find that there is a tingly, clean feeling you get from using this product.</li>
      <li>I obviously don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for me because I continued to use them for a couple weeks.</li>
      <li>Just as good as Neutregena facial towelettes...</li>
      <li>Bought these at Costco and love them but buying here cost twice as much.</li>
      <li>Really wanted to love these -</li>
      <li>But they last a while and are good makeup removing wipes.</li>
      <li>They are just as effective and soft, at a lower cost.</li>
      <li>WORKS VERY WELL FOR ME!VERY SOFT,SMELLS VERY CLEAN KEEPS MY FACE WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF OIL!</li>
      <li>Luckily for me I do not wear make up every day</li>
      <li>Good price and great convenience for product not readily available locally.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with these facial towelettes.  </li>
      <li>It did a good job of removing it, but it&#x27;s advisable to either wipe off the excess or let it dry before reopening your eyes.</li>
      <li>gentle and does a great job removing long wearing makeup!</li>
      <li>Nice big towelettes that remove grime even after I wash my face with soap &amp; water.</li>
      <li>I still use a light milky cleanser after but the final result is so much better now.</li>
      <li>So worth it.</li>
      <li>skin feels very soft after using these and more importantly, feels very clean without feeling dry or tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>needed to be washed off right away;  </li>
      <li>Still enjoying the simple scent and softness.  </li>
      <li>I love these wipes and have bought multiple times.</li>
      <li>Not expensive.  </li>
      <li>Product received exactly as advertised and ahead of schedule.  </li>
      <li>I love the different size packages inside.</li>
      <li>Soft and  smells clean.  </li>
      <li>that &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling that can sometimes happen with certain cleaning products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, they were so large.</li>
      <li>Order came on time and they are very thick &amp; plush with lots of moisture; of all the facial cleansing cloths these are the best!</li>
      <li>They do the job very well.</li>
      <li>Even have teen son using it to keep his face pimple free.</li>
      <li>Really like these.  </li>
      <li>Gentle and non drying.  </li>
      <li>(And,  yes - I could have cut them in hafl, but really?)</li>
      <li>I have highly sensitive skin and many skin products, lotions, facial wash and makeup will result in a skin reaction for me.</li>
      <li>Wow!!!</li>
      <li>really these just smell like regular baby wipes, clean.</li>
      <li>The main reason I gave them away, though?</li>
      <li>The sheet is very durable, soft and it takes everything off!</li>
      <li>While this could have been a problem - pressure on the package at the right spot and degree will cause the plastic sealed package to &amp;#34;explode&amp;#34; or open at the weakest point.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, with no residue left over.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>First, they are SO BIG!</li>
      <li>Individual packages will were removed from the box (pictures here as they are sold at Cosco) and placed into large envelope.</li>
      <li>And I do NOT have sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think these are a little pricey. But they last a while and are good makeup removing wipes.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and good product</li>
    <li> first time user very happy with it.</li>
    <li> These wipes are very good and compare to higher priced brand.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these facial towelettes.  They are of a great size and do not cause any problems with my skin.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> These have been awesome to have close at hand for my post-op surgical recovery! Don&#x27;t know what I would have done without them! Very gentle, with no residue left over. I didn&#x27;t use them all, which was good, because once my 15 yr old Granddaughter got hold of them, she fell in love with them for removing her make-up! They don&#x27;t sting her eyes, not oily, no smell. I can&#x27;t think of anything you couldn&#x27;t use them for. I&#x27;m ordering another box of them, as I write this. I love the different size packages inside. Put the smaller one in your purse, another in your night stand, one in your car...These are the best!!</li>
    <li> Cleans all makeup. Easy on face. Doesn&#x27;t dry out. I think it kinda exfoliates some but I still do it separately. Really like these.  Even have teen son using it to keep his face pimple free. Couldn&#x27;t have done that with the overpriced versions. This is just as good as those.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried so far. I have highly sensitive skin and many skin products, lotions, facial wash and makeup will result in a skin reaction for me. However, this towelette has proven to be effective and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> I have been using these facial cloths for over a year.  They are a generous size and the dual sided textures are great for facial and eye make-up removal.  Gentle and non drying.  I will continue to use these and the value is fantastic.</li>
    <li> These wipes are HUGE and fantastic! One wipe and I can get all of my makeup off and then wipe my face to make sure it&#x27;s all off. They smell clean and one side has raised bumps so that it can clean better.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes and have bought multiple times. Not sticky, or slimy. Takes makeup off easy and thoroughly. Relatively no scent, depending on how sensitive you are to smell, but really these just smell like regular baby wipes, clean. I use these everyday before going to bed.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! I just started using these. Can throw away that nasty eye makeup remover now. These wipes take off everything!!! 11.99 at costco. So worth it. I only need one a time.</li>
    <li> Product received exactly as advertised and ahead of schedule.  Good price and great convenience for product not readily available locally.</li>
    <li> Love the kirkland wipes. They are the most moist wipes i have ever use. The price is terrific for the amount each pack holds. Great for removing makeup and also for traveling with the smaller packs. Love them!!</li>
    <li> They do the job very well. I do not have a lot of time to do a time consuming skin care routine everyday and these towellets quickly remove all make up. I use them everyday. If you are looking for facial towellets these are great.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product in about two months span. I  absolutely love it and so does my sisters...so I usually buy it an share with them which means I will be needing a new box again in a month.</li>
    <li> Order came on time and they are very thick &amp; plush with lots of moisture; of all the facial cleansing cloths these are the best!</li>
    <li> Not as &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as I would have liked. They&#x27;re moist, but not as moist as the majority of the other makeup remover wipes on the market. If you don&#x27;t want a very wet makeup wipe then this will be prefect for you. Removes the majority of my makeup and it&#x27;s a great price, I just personally prefer a more moist wipe.</li>
    <li> Love these.  Soft and  smells clean.  Not expensive.  I tear them in half so they last a long time.  I use them for removing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a big fan of Kirkland dupes, so when I saw Costco started carrying Kirkland Daily Facial Towelettes I quickly ditched my usual Neutrogena wipes and went for these. What a mistake! These are awful. They don&#x27;t take off all my eye makeup, even when I rub vigorously at it. And when I rub vigorously at it, they sting my eyes.... awful! Especially when I compare it to Neutrogena and reminisce wistfully over how gentle they were. What&#x27;s sad is the box even says \\&quot;Now gentler formula!\\&quot; - definitely not gentle enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just wear foundation or wear no makeup, I&#x27;d go for these, but if you want to remove eye makeup I&#x27;d avoid these until Kirkland makes an even gentler, more effective formula.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these wipes! I&#x27;ve recently started getting into makeup and removing some of the waterproof eye makeup and even some of my thicker foundations can be hard to remove. I was just using the Neutrogena eye make up remover, and while that worked fine, I prefer these wipes. This brand is amazing, though it is much, MUCH cheaper at Costco. If you don&#x27;t have a membership, I suggest the Neutrogena wipes. You also get way more than 150 now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use this at night before I wash my face. The sheet is very durable, soft and it takes everything off! I use it sometimes in the morning if I&#x27;m in a rush while running out the door if I can&#x27;t wash my face. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel dry or that &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling that can sometimes happen with certain cleaning products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love that I don&#x27;t have to rub at my eyes. Just a few down swipes and even the most stubborn mascara comes off. If you see these, definitely get them! It has two smaller, &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; packs that are perfect for on the go or overnight stays to limit what you bring.</li>
    <li> This is a great value -- and it keeps me from having to go to Costco...which makes it worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These facial wipes were such a disappointment. Luckily for me I do not wear make up every day so I used them only a few times a week. That being said these wipes burned my face a bit and were extremely drying. I obviously don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for me because I continued to use them for a couple weeks. My face became incredibly dry, flaky and I started breaking out like I haven&#x27;t since I was in my teens. I do moisturizer daily but it didn&#x27;t help. I now have not been using them for two weeks and my skin is starting to recover. I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent eye makeup removal; all in one swipe.</li>
    <li> best wipes for makeup... wife needs them.... neeeeeeeeds them... love them to the max</li>
    <li> You get tons and tons of these and they are wider than normal wipes which is great.</li>
    <li> Excellent item. Costco has been out of stock for a while and I was afraid they were discontinued, so I bought them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are thicker, larger and stronger than any other facial wipe I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to rinse after using these, but I do just because I do.&lt;br /&gt;These remove all my makeup including mascara and liner.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels very soft after using these and more importantly, feels very clean without feeling dry or tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick! Individual packages will were removed from the box (pictures here as they are sold at Cosco) and placed into large envelope. While this could have been a problem - pressure on the package at the right spot and degree will cause the plastic sealed package to &amp;#34;explode&amp;#34; or open at the weakest point. For some of the individual packages that&#x27;s where the little hard plastic opening door thing is glued to the package. It&#x27;s happened before at home. NO problems with these at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for some years now.  Still enjoying the simple scent and softness.  Ordered a couple of boxes for me and mother.  She likes it, too.</li>
    <li> WORKS VERY WELL FOR ME!VERY SOFT,SMELLS VERY CLEAN KEEPS MY FACE WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF OIL! PRICE IS GREAT!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product did irritate my skin.  I developed a rough rash all over my face but especially around my eyes because of eye makeup removal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m switching from Ponds to these.  They are just as effective and soft, at a lower cost.</li>
    <li> These come in packs of 15 which is AMAZING to keep from drying out and leave in my travel bag/at gym.</li>
    <li> Nice big towelettes that remove grime even after I wash my face with soap &amp; water. Leave your face feeling nice and clean.</li>
    <li> Best, hands down, make up remover out there.  Very good price for the amount you get.  Don&#x27;t let the generic brands fool you.</li>
    <li> These work very well and are at a great price compared to like products you can find in a drug store. I was very excited to find these on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had. Bought these at Costco and love them but buying here cost twice as much. Don&#x27;t have a Costco membership so went ahead and bought them.</li>
    <li> These are the best facial tissues and reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> These are great face wipes really take all the makeup off but so over priced. At Costco these are $11.99</li>
    <li> Very sturdy wipes at a good price.</li>
    <li> Repulsive smell, not moist at all, feels like one smears stinging alcohol and grease on face - stings and burns;  needed to be washed off right away;  really bad product.  What a waste...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the wipes for a long time.  They are great and don&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> Not sure I can survive without these.  I keep the smaller packs in my car for those &amp;#34;sticky situations&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was looking for cleaning facial towelettes for a long time - nothing seemed to remove makeup completely (not that I use much - usually just the foundation, some  blush and a mascara). These do the job! I still use a light milky cleanser after but the final result is so much better now. These will be a part of my routine for a while.</li>
    <li> Good value! And good for my skin!</li>
    <li> I use a cpap machine, and prefer to remove all makeup at bedtime. This is perfect, the towels are large, and do a wonderful job! Will order again!!</li>
    <li> Just as good as Neutregena facial towelettes...gentle and does a great job removing long wearing makeup! I have very sensitive eyes and these do not burn or dry out the delicate area around my eyes!</li>
    <li> I did find that there is a tingly, clean feeling you get from using this product. I bought this mostly to remove my makeup easily. I didn&#x27;t realize about the &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; feeling before using it to remove my eye makeup though. It did a good job of removing it, but it&#x27;s advisable to either wipe off the excess or let it dry before reopening your eyes. I also thought the amount of cloth per wipe was a bit excessive. I think it may have been less wasteful if the cloth was 1/2 it&#x27;s current size. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great deal and has great quality.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to love these - but they left my skin red, dry and very uncomfortable. I like cleansing wipes - so much easier on those nights when I just feel lazy and don&#x27;t want to do the basin/soap/water/towel routine. But I did not like a couple of things about these wipes. First, they are SO BIG! I know some reviewers like that about them, but I found them to be so wasteful and almost ridiculous, they were so large. I felt like I was wasting half every time I used one.  (And,  yes - I could have cut them in hafl, but really?) The main reason I gave them away, though? The ingredients were so hard on my skin. And I do NOT have sensitive skin. I routinely use Retin-A, Vitamin C, and AHA products. I&#x27;ve used this regimen for years with not a single problem.  But two nights using these wipes and my skin was so tight and tender I felt like it had been burned.  I don&#x27;t know how helpful this is for any one else - every one&#x27;s skin is different and can tolerate different things. But sadly, these did not work for me.</li>
