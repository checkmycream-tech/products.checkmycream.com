### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great night cream!</li>
      <li>Aveeno is the very best without question.  </li>
      <li>I was impressed</li>
      <li>This lotion is great!</li>
      <li>I always loved aveeno products!</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>some of them not so great either.  </li>
      <li>It helps with moisturizing and is great no matter your age.</li>
      <li>and it smells great too</li>
      <li>The texture is great.</li>
      <li>It also smells and feels great.</li>
      <li>wanted that summer glow and smooth skin, and it works perfect!</li>
      <li>I have been told before that a good scent doesn&#x27;t always equate to a good product.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a really good night cream.</li>
      <li>This product smells good and does a good job moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I am 25 with an exceptionally Snow White-esque complexion, so this is all preventative.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and very nice.</li>
      <li>I love this cream!</li>
      <li>So I have been using the Aveeno Positively Radiant 30 SPF day cream for a month and it has been wonderful.</li>
      <li>Loving it and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;standing water in it and didn&#x27;t smell nice like the cleanser.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice and smoothes your skin .</li>
      <li>I wake up with perfectly moisturized skin and it helps keep my skin clear</li>
      <li>The fragrance is nice and refreshing.</li>
      <li>The Aveeno line is excellent in both results and social responsibility.</li>
      <li>It is just more subdued.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>While I love this product, I would suggest finding another seller.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re worried about getting more for your money, no fear.</li>
      <li>i really love this stuff</li>
      <li>I love the Aveeno cleanser</li>
      <li>I have tried facial creams priced from 200 dollars (give or take lol) to 4.99!  </li>
      <li>make sure you understand the science of using vitamin B. Helps with wrinkles too.</li>
      <li>After using them both for a two months, I find that they both work well, though I prefer the day SPF cream more.</li>
      <li>and I must say that I&#x27;m glad that I have.</li>
      <li>which does not appear to be all that truthful about ingredients at this time.  </li>
      <li>This night cream has a lovely smooth consistency.</li>
      <li>Well at first I loved it because it felt so smooth and moised after applying.</li>
      <li>Great product for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I bought a couple other Aveeno products and have been very happy with them</li>
      <li>Heard about the importance of face skin cream containing vitamin B. Finding this brand with the B vitamin wasn&#x27;t easy, but know that I know I can purchase it on Amazon it makes it easy.</li>
      <li>It is not as strong.</li>
      <li>In reality, most moisturizers do a good job at moisturizing, which is the most basic function that your skin needs.  </li>
      <li>Dr. Oz had a Doctor on that said rather than pay huge amounts of money for some of the skin products out there</li>
      <li>Nice texture, and fast absorption</li>
      <li>This night cream is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Well, I have had fabulous results.</li>
      <li>This is just smooth and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>Now that I am aware of this, it seems most of their marketing is somewhat deceptive in this way.  </li>
      <li>It is light and vanishes quickly..</li>
      <li>It smells clean, too, and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my sheets, which I like.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, it arrived quickly, and the price was comparable to my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is much thinner, so it takes a lot more to rub in.</li>
      <li>This is not to be mistaken for that cool, minty feel you get from some creams.</li>
      <li>and unlike some moisturizers it absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>you know how pregnant women always have that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;?</li>
      <li>Seems to do a good enough job and at the right price.</li>
      <li>It is in a small(ish) jar, but the cream is smooth and spreads easily and is not hard to spread throughout my face and decolletage.</li>
      <li>Really soaks into the skin, feels light yet hydrating.</li>
      <li>use it faithfully for a week and you will notice better, clear, softer skin.  </li>
      <li>Nice night cream, not too heavy and with a light clean scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;***UPDATE - Now that cooler weather has arrived, I&#x27;ve started using this night cream more regularly</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very different in many ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time, it burned my skin</li>
      <li>So I actually just transferred it to a pump bottle to save the hassle and it comes out ok, but still inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>On my first use, I felt a burning sensation on my cheeks which lasted for a couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>but I have been to Israel and LOVE some Ahava products I could only buy there</li>
      <li>Since Jennifer Aniston reps their products, I wonder if she&#x27;s aware of how deceptive this company is?</li>
      <li>With the positively radiant 30 spf, it leaves a very dry texture which is nice.</li>
      <li>For example, when I went to their website and clicked on the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; list for this product, they give a very colorful description that&#x27;s full of nice sounding adjectives (and implying they are all natural ingredients), but when you press their customer relations department further, you discover there are actually about 15 ingredients in this face lotion....</li>
      <li>Aveeno user and have used the positively radiant skin care line (face wash, moisturizer, night cream and bb cream) for quite some time.</li>
      <li>I use all the Aveeno positively radiant products.</li>
      <li>The day cream is very smooth and dry.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Positively Radiant?\\&quot;- the day cream worked really well for me.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of their daily spf positively radiant cream</li>
      <li>I will buy it again and it was a decent price for the product!</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars as I am comparing it to very high-end creams.  </li>
      <li>Reasonable pricing too.</li>
      <li>I really llike it.  </li>
      <li>My face feels very oily-like.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>It is also has a very &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
      <li>so whenever I try new moisturizers, they always burn at first.</li>
      <li>I apparently missed seeing their COMPLETE ingredients list when I threw away the box in which this originally was packaged.  </li>
      <li>When I opened it, the container was way too full and the texture and smell of the cream were not the same as the store-bought one that I was replacing.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to pay a lot of money to get the benefits of a decent moisturizing regimen.</li>
      <li>(although no one had tried this particular intensive night cream)...</li>
      <li>I apply this particular cream at night before bed.</li>
      <li>A little goes a huge way!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to the scent, especially since it fades pretty fast.</li>
      <li>The ingredients list which they promote, portrays them as being very natural, using &amp;#34;soy based&amp;#34; products.  </li>
      <li>This freaked me out and at first I thought it was the face wash that was causing the sensation, but the second time I used it without anything else, I felt it again.</li>
      <li>This is a new product for me and so far I like it.</li>
      <li>But then again, they are owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson, so we shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised.  </li>
      <li>I use it as a day cream on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I just have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I wake up and my skin feels so soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised because all of my friends had recommended Aveeno</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this cream! I wake up with perfectly moisturized skin and it helps keep my skin clear</li>
    <li> I love the Aveeno cleanser but unfortunately this came with&lt;br /&gt;standing water in it and didn&#x27;t smell nice like the cleanser.</li>
    <li> The texture is great. I am actually using it as a day cream as well in the mornings after I wash my face. I am on my second jar now.</li>
    <li> I have always used aveeno products it&#x27;s nice and smoothes your skin .👍</li>
    <li> Use it alternately at night with my other night creams. Seems to do a good enough job and at the right price.</li>
    <li> This night cream has a lovely smooth consistency. My 59 yr old skin is not dry, and this feels very soft.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product. On my first use, I felt a burning sensation on my cheeks which lasted for a couple of minutes. This is not to be mistaken for that cool, minty feel you get from some creams. This freaked me out and at first I thought it was the face wash that was causing the sensation, but the second time I used it without anything else, I felt it again. Also, the cream has an odd chemical scent - definitely not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised because all of my friends had recommended Aveeno (although no one had tried this particular intensive night cream)... but I won&#x27;t be trying any of their other products after my experience with this one!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I was allergic to this product so gave to my daughter in law.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> So I have been using the Aveeno Positively Radiant 30 SPF day cream for a month and it has been wonderful. I actually used it at night after I washed my face even though I now know it is actually a day creme. Well, I have had fabulous results. Then I saw this one is actually the night creme so I bought it to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very different in many ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Quantity- this is actually in a tub and not a pump, as well as a lower net wet (1.7 oz.) for the same price. If you&#x27;re worried about getting more for your money, no fear. Unlike the day cream which is very thick, this is very thin and light. A little goes a huge way! It would take me just as long to go through this as it&#x27;s equivalent of the day cream. You really don&#x27;t need a lot. I just don&#x27;t like the idea that I have to use something to get it out since there is not pump. I&#x27;m a bit of a germ freak and if I put my finger in there to get it out, then germs get in. So I actually just transferred it to a pump bottle to save the hassle and it comes out ok, but still inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Texture- this is very thin. With the positively radiant 30 spf, it leaves a very dry texture which is nice. This is completely the opposite. My face feels very oily-like. It is also a little \\&quot;sticky.\\&quot; I have to wash my face in the morning before I put on powder with this. Yes, I realize you&#x27;re supposed to always wash your face before you put on makeup anyway, but some people, like me, don&#x27;t. And if you normally do not, I think you will have to for this one because everything sticks to it. The day cream is very smooth and dry. This is just smooth and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Smell- the day creme smells a lot like sunscreen. This one does, also. It is just more subdued. It is not as strong. So if you have a problem with the day cream, you might still have a problem with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Application- it is much thinner, so it takes a lot more to rub in. But once it&#x27;s on, I think it covers as well as theday cream, just in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. \\&quot;Positively Radiant?\\&quot;- the day cream worked really well for me. After using them both for a two months, I find that they both work well, though I prefer the day SPF cream more. I also still have that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; with the night cream that I have with the SPF cream.&lt;br /&gt;6. No SPF- obvious since it&#x27;s a night creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this is just a different type of moisturizer, all together. Again, that might be obvious to some people since this says specifically a night creme, but I&#x27;m not sure that I like it better than the day version considering the consistency and feel. I find that I end up using the PRadiant SPF 30 cream at night instead of this night cream just because I either don&#x27;t feel like going to be with a sticky face or because I know I am not intending to wash my face the next morning before I put on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned a burning sensation when they started using it. I had that, too. I just have sensitive skin so whenever I try new moisturizers, they always burn at first. But this burning wasn&#x27;t too bad and went away after about four nights of putting it on after washing my face at night.</li>
    <li> I bought this on 2 separate occasions.  The first time, it burned my skin and I had to wash it off.  I have sensitive skin and thought also perhaps I got a bad batch.  I tried again with the same results.  I even tried it on my partner who has thick non-sensitive skin - same burning sensation.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple other Aveeno products and have been very happy with them so I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but it feels thinner than I expected, especially for a night cream. It burned a little upon application and my face was a bit red, but that quickly went away. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference the following day as I did with the other Aveeno products, but I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if it makes a difference. The smell is pleasant, it arrived quickly, and the price was comparable to my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE - Now that cooler weather has arrived, I&#x27;ve started using this night cream more regularly and I must say that I&#x27;m glad that I have. I wake up and my skin feels so soft. I do slather quite a bit on and allow it to absorb into my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and unlike some moisturizers it absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve gotten used to the scent, especially since it fades pretty fast. I&#x27;m definitely seeing a difference in my skin with the Aveeno regimen and will continue to use these products. I can&#x27;t ever see paying department store prices for face lotions now that I&#x27;ve found this line. Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great night cream! I live in NYC and the winter weather is pretty harsh on one&#x27;s skin so I actually wear this both day and night.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Aveeno user and have used the positively radiant skin care line (face wash, moisturizer, night cream and bb cream) for quite some time. I don&#x27;t believe that this product is actually Aveeno. I still had a little bit of my older jar of the same night cream left and noticed that they did not have the same consistency nor the same scent. In fact, this one had a weird smell to it. And while I cannot truly confirm what I am saying, I don&#x27;t know why two jars of the same product side by side would not look/smell the same. I also took into account that my jar was a little older (maybe 3 months, but I&#x27;m still not convinced they are the same). I would not recommend. While I love this product, I would suggest finding another seller.</li>
    <li> Another quality Aveeno product. Nice night cream, not too heavy and with a light clean scent. I recommend this to anyone looking for a really good night cream.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended this and it&#x27;s fantastic. Really soaks into the skin, feels light yet hydrating. I use all the Aveeno positively radiant products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several months now, so this is really disappointing to find out that many Aveeno products still contain paragons. The ingredients list which they promote, portrays them as being very natural, using &amp;#34;soy based&amp;#34; products.  I apparently missed seeing their COMPLETE ingredients list when I threw away the box in which this originally was packaged.  Now that I am aware of this, it seems most of their marketing is somewhat deceptive in this way.  For example, when I went to their website and clicked on the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; list for this product, they give a very colorful description that&#x27;s full of nice sounding adjectives (and implying they are all natural ingredients), but when you press their customer relations department further, you discover there are actually about 15 ingredients in this face lotion....some of them not so great either.  Their representative told me they are working hard to get Parabens out of their products by 2017, but I think that&#x27;s a pretty lame goal, given the present stance of their marketing....which does not appear to be all that truthful about ingredients at this time.  But then again, they are owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson, so we shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised.  Since Jennifer Aniston reps their products, I wonder if she&#x27;s aware of how deceptive this company is? Disappointing to say the least.</li>
    <li> This cream was obviously tampered with to make it go further. When I opened it, the container was way too full and the texture and smell of the cream were not the same as the store-bought one that I was replacing.</li>
    <li> Well at first I loved it because it felt so smooth and moised after applying. but after a while my face became dry. not sure if it is the cause but i feel itchy after i wash it off</li>
    <li> I have tried facial creams priced from 200 dollars (give or take lol) to 4.99!  Aveeno is the very best without question.  It hydrates, smooths, lightens dark areas, and is never greasy.  Just try it once ~  you wont regret it!  NOTE:  I recently discovered I have a wheat intolerance.  SOME, not all, Aveeno product use wheat and oats.  Even on my skin, I had problems with reactions.  If you do not have wheat issue...  The Aveeno line is excellent in both results and social responsibility.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of their daily spf positively radiant cream so I decided to try their night cream. I am 25 with an exceptionally Snow White-esque complexion, so this is all preventative. I always feel like I can see an immediate sheen as soon as it is applied, and I can literally feel my skin drinking it in. I apply this particular cream at night before bed. It is in a small(ish) jar, but the cream is smooth and spreads easily and is not hard to spread throughout my face and decolletage. It smells clean, too, and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my sheets, which I like.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! you know how pregnant women always have that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;? well this is like that glow in a bottle! Its not greasy or anything and it smells great too i really love this stuff I wanna buy like a gallon of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream on the backs of my hands every night for five weeks and have yet to notice any lightening of my &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;. The fragrance is nice and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I really llike it.  It is light and vanishes quickly..</li>
    <li> Heard about the importance of face skin cream containing vitamin B. Finding this brand with the B vitamin wasn&#x27;t easy, but know that I know I can purchase it on Amazon it makes it easy. I use it morning and night. It helps with moisturizing and is great no matter your age. Dr. Oz had a Doctor on that said rather than pay huge amounts of money for some of the skin products out there make sure you understand the science of using vitamin B. Helps with wrinkles too. I love this product. Reasonable pricing too.</li>
    <li> Product met all expectations</li>
    <li> Great product for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been told before that a good scent doesn&#x27;t always equate to a good product.  In reality, most moisturizers do a good job at moisturizing, which is the most basic function that your skin needs.  Whether a product is good or bad comes down to how effective someone is at regularly moisturizing.  This product smells good and does a good job moisturizing.  One star off for being slightly overpriced.  You don&#x27;t need to pay a lot of money to get the benefits of a decent moisturizing regimen.</li>
    <li> The cream was to keep my face moisturized and supple, not as stated, it dried my face and made it feel rough.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, and fast absorption</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my skin.  It is also has a very &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; smell.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick cream and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my face.  It also smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> This night cream is fantastic.  It makes my skin feel and look so soft and radiant, and I can definitely tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  Recommended.  (I&#x27;m in my mid-30s.)</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for the past 6 months and I noticed how radiant it made my skin look in just days!I wanted that summer glow and smooth skin, and it works perfect! I always loved aveeno products!</li>
    <li> I like the cream but I have been to Israel and LOVE some Ahava products I could only buy there so I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars as I am comparing it to very high-end creams.  My skin seems to be softer after using this consistently for the past 3 weeks.  I wanted to wait until I used it for a few weeks before writing a review.  I will buy it again and it was a decent price for the product!</li>
    <li> use it faithfully for a week and you will notice better, clear, softer skin.  I was impressed</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me and so far I like it. Not too greasy and feels calming and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This product made me itch. I tried applying this at different times of day - no difference.  I have never had any lotion that has made me itch like this before.  I can&#x27;t use this it so I gave it to my roommate.</li>
    <li> Works great. I use it as a day cream on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Never wrote a review for moisturizers but for this one I feel I should write. Love the smell and very nice. I could feel the difference in my skin with in a week. Loving it and will continue to use it.</li>
