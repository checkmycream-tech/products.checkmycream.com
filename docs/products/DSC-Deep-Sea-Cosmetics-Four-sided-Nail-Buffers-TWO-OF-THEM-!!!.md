    <li> This order was placed for my wife and she loves this product enough to also give them as gifts.  By following the easy steps her nails look great.  When people comment on her nails, she does not hesitate to tell them about DSC nail buffers.</li>
    <li> This buffer is amazing! A male co-worker told me about it and i didnt believe the hype about it, blah blah everyone says how great this and that is, but he let me try it, my nails looked like a professional did them. They had a healthy shine to them that lasted weeks. I have a farm so my hands are always getting beat up, but this product kept my nails nice and neat.</li>
    <li> These are amazing. They make my nails look like I have clear polish on they are so shiny after using these.</li>
    <li> Their products are great and well worth&lt;br /&gt;the cost.</li>
    <li> I use them to buff and even out my nails.  They make them smooth and shine as if you have clear nail polish on them for a week of more.  My sister had gotten one of these over 10 yrs,. ago, that cost her $45, but lasted until last month.  I got her a set of these as well as a set for me.  They clean easily, last a long time, and the plastic cover that comes with them can be placed back on them to protect them.  I have bought other nail buffers before, paid more for them, and they are ruined in less than 6 weeks.  So these are a great value.  I hope they will last me as long as they lasted my sister, for with 2 of them, that would equal almost 20 yrs.  A truly great buy.  I wished they had ones that were small enough to take in my purse! Thank you Deep Sea products for a great product at an even greater value!</li>
    <li> This is advertised as 2 per package....I ordered 3 packages which should mean 6 buffers...As I prepare to send out my Christmas gifts I have found only 3 in the package and so that tells me.....false advertising!!! Be aware....this should be corrected!!! the product is great however....the posting of this sale is WRONG!!!! hoping I receive the other 3 pieces soon!!!!!!!!!to correct this error....</li>
    <li> I have been trying out different &amp;#34;Deep Sea&amp;#34;  nail buffers ever since I bought the originals a few years ago.  I haven&#x27;t found any that worked as well until now.  I will definitely purchase these again!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;ve had mine for 5 years and am just now buying a new one. I&#x27;ve loved and abused my buffer and it has always made my nails so very smooth and shiny.

    <li> The Deep Sea 4 sided nail buffer does what it says.  It leaves a  shine on the nails. My hands feel wonderful after a treatment.</li>
    <li> They give your nails a truly awesome shine, I just wish they&#x27;d last longer then being used 7 or 8 times. The shine lasts a lot longer then any other one I&#x27;ve bought in a store, and feels a lot less abrasive then the other ones too.</li>
