      <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I still love this makeup!!</li>
      <li>I have been asked many times what makeup I use because people tell me it looks flawless.</li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>With that being said it seems like every time I find a foundation that works the company has to go and change the formula and ruin a perfectly good product.  </li>
      <li>I would say it lasts about 8 good hours .  </li>
      <li>easlily and the true ivory is a perfect match.</li>
      <li>This ivory shade does NOT make me look overly tan or a totally new person, it does a perfect job making me the perfect shade :)    </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay for me!</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>Loved it....not able to buy in stores any longer.  </li>
      <li>and my husband said I was so beautiful when he first saw me thank u</li>
      <li>Despite my sensitive, acne-prone skin it goes on flawlessly and stays on all day!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but I like it better than everything else I&#x27;ve tried which include Clinique superfit, Estee Lauder</li>
      <li>I think a sponge spreads it out more and blends into the skin more.</li>
      <li>Which turns out, looks way better on me than the color I was using.</li>
      <li>I used I love it</li>
      <li>It has taken me awhile to find a foundation I am 100% satisfied with.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>Color selection isn&#x27;t what it could be, and you need to make sure you get it ALL off or</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>MY FAVORITE.</li>
      <li>Once you set it though it feels perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>I am in my 40&#x27;s, light skinned but tan</li>
      <li>Enjoy  ( :</li>
      <li>I apply it with a damp makeup sponge and lightly dust with powder.  </li>
      <li>And it feels light</li>
      <li>It looks smooth and natural and makes my skin look great, but most importantly, it really does stay on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice light natural color.</li>
      <li>I liked it....am using it and find it is better than my prior foundations.  </li>
      <li>and it was True Ivory 103.</li>
      <li>I ordered true Ivory number 103 not the number 201</li>
      <li>I have a normal skin type and this is pretty nice.</li>
      <li>The bottle has changed to a glass bottle and I am glad I found some of the old plastic design on Amazon!!</li>
      <li>I first tried this as a weekend foundation based on a blogger review!</li>
      <li>Very runny and doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly.</li>
      <li>Well, I wrote a whole thing on my daily makeup routine on a review of Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder and how this foundation and the powder--plus a bit of blush and lipstick--are THE basis for feeling good about myself each day.</li>
      <li>I have used this makeup for years long before it was popular.  </li>
      <li>for coverage - it covers things up but 1 hour out the door or 2 exactly, the makeup starts to dissipate into the skin, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s so much like using pigmented - clue&amp;#34;!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>(Just clean out the flattened end, then fit the pieces together again, sliding one over the other</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t fine this stuff in the stores only on here</li>
      <li>Very neutral.  </li>
      <li>I really like it a lot.  </li>
      <li>and I want my real color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll never be as good as the original Revlon Color Stay ( before the useless softflex)</li>
      <li>I have light skin that flushes and turns red easily, and a lot of the other foundations I&#x27;ve tried mask that temporarily but then wear off.</li>
      <li>This is super sticky &amp; but thick - has the exactly feeling like putting school glue on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; sticky!!!</li>
      <li>The coverage is decent (though if you have acne or redness that you want covered, this alone is not enough as a full coverage and you will need a concealer).</li>
      <li>( I&#x27;ve tried so many and wasted so much money</li>
      <li>I have had trouble recently with products, but, this one I will continue to buy because it is just that good.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat this foundation, especially since you can cut open the tube after you think it is all gone and there is a lot more for another week or so of applications.</li>
      <li>Overall if you have decent skin (not extreme acne/redness) but just average that still needs covering than I think that this will be a good go-to/everyday foundation.</li>
      <li>This is true to the word and does last for a long long time :)</li>
      <li>After 10+  years of using Estee Lauder, I have COMPLETELY switched to this Rimmel foundation!</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, covers the pink tiny spots or bluish part under the eye (no concealer needed) and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavier on the skin than some foundations but not that heaviest I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants all over coverage, that last all day, and isn&#x27;t too steeply priced.</li>
      <li>Stays on all day with no heavy feeling.</li>
      <li>showed the makeup was worn out or old.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m light skin and usually just stuck to the lightest color I could find, which is an ivory.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>In the evening, I&#x27;m shocked at how amazing my complexion still looks!</li>
      <li>It has a slight shampoo smell, I don&#x27;t really know how else to describe it, although the smell does NOT linger.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day my front head region, in between my eye brows, began to shine a bit from my naturally oily skin -- but nothing compared to other drugstore foundations which do a lot worse on that area and do not hold back the oil that starts showing a lot at the end of the day -- but the rest of the face was perfectly fine and looked neither dry or oily but just a natural look.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this makeup for years long before it was popular.  I tried it once when my makeup was discontinued and have used ever since.  It covers well and looks great.  I have been asked many times what makeup I use because people tell me it looks flawless.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help cover the red in my face on my wedding day I loved it. it didn&#x27;t feel heavy like all the other make up I used I love it and my husband said I was so beautiful when he first saw me thank u</li>
    <li> I loved this liquid foundation! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation ever!!! I used Revlon Colorstay for about 15 yrs until they changed formula last year. I gave this a try after about 20 other longwear foundations.... OMG the BEST!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts about 10 plus hrs</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this make up. It looks smooth and natural and makes my skin look great, but most importantly, it really does stay on. I have light skin that flushes and turns red easily, and a lot of the other foundations I&#x27;ve tried mask that temporarily but then wear off. I prefer this foundation to the more expensive department store one I&#x27;d been using.</li>
    <li> Very runny and doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly. This leaves a thick coat and wears off fast. It does not last the 25 hours it claims. :(</li>
    <li> LOVE! I usually purchase name brand foundations. But it is just too expensive. It has taken me awhile to find a foundation I am 100% satisfied with. But, finally, I have found the one I will be sticking with. I can use a dime size amount and it will cover my entire face thoroughly. It also last as long as it&#x27;s advertised. I have had trouble recently with products, but, this one I will continue to buy because it is just that good. I recommend this product to anyone who wants all over coverage, that last all day, and isn&#x27;t too steeply priced.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of theatre plays and movies and I wear make up because of insecurities about my acne...I put primer and concelor on and then I put this foundation on...I ordered &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; in this foundation and it was almost white when I put it on...it has irritated my skin and not only did it make my acne worse but it put red slotches on my face and I am so disappointed  and I solemnly swear that I will never buy anything loreal again....</li>
    <li> Loved it....not able to buy in stores any longer.  The bottle has changed to a glass bottle and I am glad I found some of the old plastic design on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I first tried this as a weekend foundation based on a blogger review! After 10+  years of using Estee Lauder, I have COMPLETELY switched to this Rimmel foundation! Despite my sensitive, acne-prone skin it goes on flawlessly and stays on all day! In the evening, I&#x27;m shocked at how amazing my complexion still looks!</li>
    <li> Well, I wrote a whole thing on my daily makeup routine on a review of Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder and how this foundation and the powder--plus a bit of blush and lipstick--are THE basis for feeling good about myself each day. You can&#x27;t beat this foundation, especially since you can cut open the tube after you think it is all gone and there is a lot more for another week or so of applications. (Just clean out the flattened end, then fit the pieces together again, sliding one over the other so you still have a tube to hold the makeup.) (I hate buying glass bottles of foundation where you can&#x27;t get 1/4 the product out of the thing and you have to throw it away!) But that&#x27;s only a part of why I like this foundation. It goes on smoothly, covers the pink tiny spots or bluish part under the eye (no concealer needed) and stays on all day. It also has an SPF rating so no sun block is needed. (And it works too. I&#x27;ve worn it to the beach, no problem!)</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE. I LOVE IT. I THINK THEY ARE DISCONTINUING THIS PRODUCT IN STORES :-(</li>
    <li> I have a normal skin type and this is pretty nice. A little bit goes a long way and the color matches me. The coverage is decent (though if you have acne or redness that you want covered, this alone is not enough as a full coverage and you will need a concealer). It has a slight shampoo smell, I don&#x27;t really know how else to describe it, although the smell does NOT linger. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest putting this on alone without a setting powder because it feels kinda sticky. Once you set it though it feels perfectly fine. It&#x27;s a bit heavier on the skin than some foundations but not that heaviest I&#x27;ve used by far. Overall if you have decent skin (not extreme acne/redness) but just average that still needs covering than I think that this will be a good go-to/everyday foundation. Plus they don&#x27;t test on animals! Score!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Stays on all day with no heavy feeling. Love I can subscribe &amp; save, therefore I never run out. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. It lasted all day (about 12 hours) and didn&#x27;t fade away at all neither showed the makeup was worn out or old. It applies smoothly and a little goes a long way. At the end of the day my front head region, in between my eye brows, began to shine a bit from my naturally oily skin -- but nothing compared to other drugstore foundations which do a lot worse on that area and do not hold back the oil that starts showing a lot at the end of the day -- but the rest of the face was perfectly fine and looked neither dry or oily but just a natural look. I recommend this product as an affordable and very good foundation and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered true Ivory number 103 not the number 201 whatever that is I&#x27;m mad and I want my real color I&#x27;m not that dark and I don&#x27;t know who to contact u guys please I&#x27;m begging u I can&#x27;t fine this stuff in the stores only on here I&#x27;m dying without this</li>
    <li> I liked it....am using it and find it is better than my prior foundations.  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is super sticky &amp; but thick - has the exactly feeling like putting school glue on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; sticky!!! (Also irritates the skin pretty bad &amp; I&#x27;m not sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;As for coverage - it covers things up but 1 hour out the door or 2 exactly, the makeup starts to dissipate into the skin, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s so much like using pigmented - clue&amp;#34;!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it... It has sat in my makeup bag ever since.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering Ivory 100 but I got it and it was True Ivory 103. Which turns out, looks way better on me than the color I was using. I still love this makeup!! It covers well with very little makeup, it lasts me a long time. I use their matter powder with it as well and it lasts me all day. And it feels light, I don&#x27;t ever feel like I have makeup on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. Love it. Stays on and moisturizes. With longterm use it makes my skin looks better, less tired and less aged (I&#x27;m 52). Color selection isn&#x27;t what it could be, and you need to make sure you get it ALL off or it might break you out. Still, it&#x27;s my daily go-to cover.</li>
    <li> This is true to the word and does last for a long long time :) It is a little difficult for me to get it off but that&#x27;s okay for me! The tube also drips a little bit of the foundation but again its just a small dot. I bought this to make me look just a smidge darker. I&#x27;m light skin and usually just stuck to the lightest color I could find, which is an ivory. This ivory shade does NOT make me look overly tan or a totally new person, it does a perfect job making me the perfect shade :)    I also suggest using a sponge to apply this foundation instead of a brush. I think a sponge spreads it out more and blends into the skin more. And defiantly use a powder foundation to set this one as well.</li>
    <li> I only wear long lasting, water resistant , humidity proof foundations. With that being said it seems like every time I find a foundation that works the company has to go and change the formula and ruin a perfectly good product.  I decided to try Rimmel based on countless reviews and price.  I really like it a lot.  I apply it with a damp makeup sponge and lightly dust with powder.  I would say it lasts about 8 good hours .  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either. Hopefully they won&#x27;t change the formula .  It&#x27;ll never be as good as the original Revlon Color Stay ( before the useless softflex) but I like it better than everything else I&#x27;ve tried which include Clinique superfit, Estee Lauder Double wear, Maybelline SuperStay...etc  ( I&#x27;ve tried so many and wasted so much money it&#x27;s ridiculous !)  For the price you can&#x27;t beat Rimmel.  I am in my 40&#x27;s, light skinned but tan easlily and the true ivory is a perfect match. It&#x27;s a nice light natural color. Not ghost like or pinky at all.  Very neutral.  Enjoy  ( :</li>
