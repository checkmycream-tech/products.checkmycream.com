<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife has been using this Serum and her age lines are much less noticeable.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Using daily and have seen a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin.  I have greasy skin and I have been able to use this product under my makeup.  That is amazing since I never use any type of cream under my foundation.  This serum is a wonderful base before applying makeup.</li>
    <li> It appears to be working very well. I have not had any peeling from it but have been using pure glycerin over it. Had two people say to me lately that my skin looked great.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> My face looks a lot smoother, my pores look smaller and my skin feels tighter. This product is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I like the Retinol and with combination with vitamin C it is a winner</li>
    <li> Great product,  easy to use and great results.  Skin became smoother, more even, and just looked better without make up on. I have used it twice a day for one month.</li>
    <li> I adore InstaNaturals products. I especially love their retinol based products. Retinol is a proven wrinkle reducer, and this formula has the perfect amount for plumping up skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally see results overnight with this. My skin is fuller, and looks spectacular. After a few days, I can notice a visible difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a product for review on my blog.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful serum by InstaNatural, this Vitamin C prep goes on like a dream. Works wonders on brown spots and blemishes, and really gives a super boost to aging skin. The serum prep absorbs so nicely, you&#x27;d never even know you had it on. Great under your nighttime moisturizer as part of your skincare regimen. It has a nice scent, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company makes really superb products, and the price is phenomenal considering how big the bottle is. I&#x27;m a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> Feels amazing and starting to see results in my skin</li>
    <li> Worked well and smelled great. Not a lot in the bottle, but it seems to go farz</li>
    <li> Does nothing but break me out!</li>
    <li> Impressed with this product so far.  My skin feels softer and smoother after about two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;milk&amp;#34; seems to heal as it is absorbed into the skin making skin look better after one use. Love the antioxidants and vitamins allowing me to nourish my skin from the outside and my skin is hungry!  Always pleased with InstaNatural products.  Great find.  Great company.</li>
    <li> I received the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum for free for use and review.  It came in a pretty blue glass bottle with an orange-reddish label.  The liquid was a cloudy light orange color, thickish as opposed to watery.  What was so tantalizing about it was the fragrant scent of oranges. I do not mean artificial candy orange, but pure orange like juice from a fresh squeezed orange. Tasting it was empting, nut obviously not an option!  It was a pleasant surprise and made application more pleasing to the senses.  The scent did not longer, so you did not smell like a vitamin C tablet all day.  The liquid came out in a dropper format and it came out slowly enough so you could control the amount.  It went on very smoothly and spread across the skin very nicely.  It left a softness and did not have a sticky feeling.  The nice part of this serum is that it is made of natural ingredients.  including 20% Vitamin C which may account for the pleasant scent. Vitamin C is an antioxidant used to help repair the skin and to help avoid future damage.  Other ingredients include: Hyaluronic Acid (moisturizes skin), Tea Tree Oil (a skin soother), and Retinol (a pore de-clogger).  It does not matter what type of skin you have (dry, oily, or combo) as this products is &amp;#34;one size fits all.&amp;#34;  There was a noticeable difference in the diminishing of fine lines especially around my mouth and eyes.  I felt as if my skin was more youthful.  Everything you would want in a skin serum can be found in one bottle. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used for 3 weeks. I have noticed a slight change, but nothing big. Let&#x27;s see when I finish the bottle if the changes are noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - it smells wonderful and flows over my skin well - soaking in and leaving my face feeling great - the smell wakes me up and also is a treat when I get ready for bed at night.  I love the texture and the way my skin looks - I met with a new Dr. yesterday and he looked at my chart and then back at me and said, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re 44?&amp;#34;  I said no I was 45 - he looked shocked and said, &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t look it.&amp;#34;  Yeah!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great and when I run out I will be buying more - I really like everything about it and my skin is looking good and feeling better then it has in a few years.  Thank you InstaNatural for these results and like I said the smell is amazing and I look forward to using this everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks now and I have seen no difference.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this serum for about a week now. This serum smells very citrusy, as if you were peelign oranges. It dries down to a very nice feel after  a few minutes. I do recommend to let it completely dry, so wait at least 5 mins. before applying moisturizer and/or foundation! Since it&#x27;s only been a week, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a result. Though, I am still very optimistic after reading so many great reviews. The only downside is when you apply this and go outside, somehow the wind makes it smell &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34;; I can&#x27;t quite describe it. I guess it&#x27;s because of the vitamin B ingredient in it. And your partner might taste a bit of bitterness if you two make out. LOL</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Been using for a couple weeks and my face has never looked better.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have several of Insta-Natural&#x27;s products, but this is my favorite.  I am 45 with still some breakouts.  This handles my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin beautifully, and keeps blemishes away; you can&#x27;t beat it!  Keep making it!!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum with Retinol and Salicylic Acid is what you want for smoother brighter skin.  I have been using the serum now for quite a while and I like the effect of the Vitamin C it makes my skin a little brighter and my pores seem finer.  The Salicylic Acid does aid in sloughing off the dull top layer but you have to find the right schedule that works best for you. I find if I use it daily it is too drying and my skin flakes too rapidly as I do want to use a foundation daily.  I found that about twice a week for the Salicylic acid one is perfect and the off days I use their serum with Vitamin C &amp; Hyalauronic Acid but no Salicylic Acid. I ha e been trying quite a few of the facial products on a promotion from InstaNatural and really liking them.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Although long-term review isn&#x27;t ready, the stuff delivers immediately noticeable results. It&#x27;s not a facelift or laser resurfacing, or a miracle in a bottle, but it does improve the overall texture, tone and smoothness of the skin. Originally purchased as an aftershave (OUCH) it turns out that it made the bumps and inflammation on my neck go away so well I started using it all over my face - worth the money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum! Before discovering this serum, I was using the Estee Lauder night repair and enlighten serums religiously and failed to see results. I have only been using this serum for a few months, and I have noticed great improvements in the overall health, texture and tone of my skin. I no longer receive hormonal breakouts or even breakouts in general. This has also cleared my skin up better than proactiv+. Love this serum!</li>
    <li> The serum is fantastic I have been using it for a few weeks and I really like it. It soaks in easily and I have noticed brighter skin when I wake up in the morning as well as diminished scaring I had from acne. I have started using it on other scars I have as well and its working wonderfully! Its pretty active so I only use it every other night since I was using it every day and my skin starting feeling dry plus I am only 29 an i don&#x27;t need something super active evryday. I highly recommend this serum give it a try!</li>
    <li> Definitely seeing results! My ance scars are getting lighter &amp; haven&#x27;t had no major break out since I&#x27;ve been using this product!!! Love it. Only down side is I wish I wasn&#x27;t running out of it so soon! Need a larger bottle to purchase..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the right treatment for my acne prone skin.  Proactiv works pretty well but it causes my face to be more red than the skin on my neck and chest, making it very noticeable.  This product still makes my face a little red, so I only use it at night, but I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is clearing up. So happy!</li>
    <li> Wow..I&#x27;m 45 and have oily skin, sun spots, and uneven looking skin.  This product has really toned down the breakouts, and my skin looks better than it has in years.  I use it only at night as otherwise my skin was red.  A really good product, not oily at all, soaks right it.  Really impressed.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and completely cleared up my acne! I have not noticed an improvement in hyper pigmentation but I am just happy that my acne has cleared.</li>
    <li> I loved the texture and moisture that this product provides. Unfortunately the oils in the product did not agree with my skin. This company is 5 star when it comes to customer service and they guided me through the process of trying to acclimate my skin to this serum. I will definitely try other products from this line.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Instanatural products. I own this one and seven other of their products because they are so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and for the last two years, I&#x27;ve had problems with breaking outs. I&#x27;ve used so many other brands from Olay to Clinique, and non of them really worked to clear my skin up. I started using Instanatural&#x27;s products about three months ago. And after I started using this serum, I definitely saw a difference. My skin feels soft and looks bright and clear. I don&#x27;t get terrible breakouts like I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that they send emails giving advise on how to use their products or to see how I&#x27;m liking them. Such great service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instanatural is my new go-to for skin care.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have acne and this product had a lot of good reviews. However, I don&#x27;t think it really worked for me, personally. Products work differently for everybody, but I still had bad acne even though I applied this serum twice a day after washing my face. It wasn&#x27;t that great. I started using plain avocado oil to moisturize my skin after washing my face and that seems to work even better.</li>
    <li> Gave me hyperpigmentation.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the serum for a few days now. But, I can see that my face is smoother. My skin just seems to absorb it and I like that is not greasy. Good for use after shaving.</li>
    <li> Smell great&lt;br /&gt; But somehow sting my skin. Quaite afraid to use actually</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a month.  I have acne-prone skin (in my 30&#x27;s GAH!), acne scars, and dark spots.  I am skeptic of most products (even rx strength-I&#x27;ve tried just about everything).  I stumbled onto this product and was somewhat in awe of the reviews.  I ordered a bottle with less than high hopes.  The customer service was great before I even got my product! I received an email with directions and the money back policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really diligent about using this product twice a day the first week or so.  I swear I could tell a difference in two days.  My mom had seen me in that time-frame and asked what I was doing differently, my face looked better (in TWO days!).  She went home and ordered a bottle for herself.  She called after a week and said, &amp;#34;I swear I can see a difference&amp;#34;.  So I will be finishing off this bottle and will likely become a regular user.  The smell is fresh and citrusy, my face doesn&#x27;t turn red when I put it on and overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday and I have noticed a dramatic change in my skin health.</li>
    <li> this is helping evening out my skin tone</li>
    <li> I rarely feel compelled to leave a review but I am so impressed with this product. In the past few months I have been having an issue with my breakouts leading to dark scars on my cheeks and neck. I spoke to an esthetician who suggested using a product with Retinol and Salicylic Acid. Within 2 weeks of using this serum I saw and felt a difference in the evenness and suppleness of my skin. I paired this Serum with Acure - Oil Control Facial Moisturizer. The blemishes I did have disappeared in the first week. I cannot imagine not using this serum in my regime! I have been avoiding being in too much sun so I am worried about not having an spf on my face but I haven&#x27;t found a facial sun lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> While this serum may reduce wrinkles, it causes my skin to break out horribly. I will not be able to use it again.</li>
    <li> Love this product, is helping me with brown spots on my face! I have been using it for two weeks only and is working really good.</li>
    <li> This has been the first product (of many) that I&#x27;ve tried that has been able to eliminate my cystic acne. I highly recommend this to anyone with damaged skin! I will definitely be purchasing this again, the difference has literally been night and day.</li>
    <li> Love this...don&#x27;t know why people are complaining about this. I got out of my routine for a couple of days and I broke several places...not happy...got right back on my routine.   LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> awesome product - can see a change in my skin already - definitely hasn&#x27;t looked so good ever!</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this serum considering the high rating. It didn&#x27;t really do anything special besides take away the redness from washing my face. It smells lovely. But sadly, saw no improvement of my skin. Honestly, my skin was better off without this product.</li>
    <li> Just 1 bottle and it has drastically cleared up my face already.  Acne, scars, redness, purple spots on sides of the front of my forehead from wearing a football helmet for 15 years.  Yep this little bottle is great and got rid of things I didn&#x27;t even buy it for.  The directions say to use it twice a day... but I only apply it once every 1 or 2 nights and still see a difference in the mirror.  So using it that way a bottle lasts around 2 months.</li>
    <li> Good results and fine for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my acne. It burned when I put it on my face and made my skin very red. Almost feels like I broke out worse :(</li>
    <li> Overall, I would say this cuts down on &#x27;oily&#x27; skin and I feel it may help with breakouts.  I find it worth using on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my face feel and look! Glad I tried this product!</li>
    <li> Actually works well....clears dark spots fast if you exfoliate skin first and great for darker skinned ladies. I&#x27;m brown mocha complexion and I have years of old marks.....they clear up within two weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I wash with aveeno ultra calming foam wash then I apply the ultra calming sunscreen moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Then at night I exfoliate with my African black soap &amp; off brand clarisonic that does wonders by the way.... don&#x27;t spend extra money on a product because of commercials or YouTube channels lol....then right after I apply this serum with no toner then moisturizer and go to bed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wake up and repeat</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Smoother, brighter and blemish free skin. I am on my third bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month. I&#x27;m not impressed... If anything, my skin is a smidge worse...</li>
    <li> I noticed an immediate difference in my skin within days of using. My pores appear smaller and my blemishes have cleared. My face appears &amp;#34;sun-kissed&amp;#34;. I placed a second order - one happy customer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to leave reviews for products but...this time I AM!! I have been using this serum now every morning for a month. I only apply to face/neck in morning after cleansing and do not put any moisturizer over it. do not put on at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 46 years old and have bizarre skin - it is sometimes oily, sometimes dry, I am showing signs of aging on my face (wrinkles around eyes, bigger pores, lack of firmness due to loss of collagen), on top of that, I have extremely sensitive skin which causes me to break out with acne when I use most types of scrubs, cleansers, moisturizers, serums, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But guess what?? this Vitamin C Serum with 2.5% Retinol is PURE MAGIC. it goes on a little thick and you think it will clog your pores, but it doesn&#x27;t. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft, this clear, this vibrant, this glowing, and this firm since I was in my late 20s. Dark circles under eyes? gone. Fine lines around eyes, greatly reduced. Breakouts? non-existent. Big pores? getting smaller every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need for moisturizer or primer to put on face before makeup? well since I started using this serum, I haven&#x27;t worn any makeup except mascara now for over 3 weeks. Simply brilliant. I think this is due to the unique combination of vitamin c, tea tree oil, retinol, I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t care really. I just know I will be buying this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to try this serum...seriously. Give it 3-4 weeks and see if you don&#x27;t experience the same transformation I have.</li>
    <li> MY SKIN IS SO SOFT AND IS CLEARING UP SO NICE!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks, and I can definitely see a difference. My acne/scars have cleared up and my dark spots are fading. I love this product and will continue using!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Insta Natural for about 4 weeks.  I think I see a difference in the lines along my upper lip.  I have been using it on the back of my hand where the dark spots were bad.  I can really see the difference.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well on my combination skin. I haven&#x27;t used it for very long, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I am a male, have plenty of acne spots that I want to get rid of and bought this about 2-3 weeks ago. I can definitely see the improvement in my face from just a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con: It&#x27;s a little hard to apply. I live in a dry climate place and I can never quite apply it directly to my skin with my fingers as the instructions indicate (it just doesn&#x27;t apply well). I always dilute a few drops in a bit of water on my palm and then slather it on like after shave. It seems to work for now.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin that easily breaks out. Using the Vitamin C Serum (currently twice a day although when my skin gets too dry I only use once a day) has reduced how oily my skin appears and consequently I have fewer and less inflamed breakouts. I have also noticed some lightening of old acne spots after using the serum for 3 months</li>
    <li> I really need this since I&#x27;m over 40 and trying to stay looking youthful. I thought it worked pretty good. I will buy again</li>
    <li> This has made my face feel tighter only after 2 weeks of using it. I do use it both day and night (Day - with plenty of sunscreen) and I can feel a difference. It also has a very pleasant orange citrus smell. Usually products that are so powerful smell really bad, so I was pleasantly surprised with the scent.</li>
    <li> Love it, I am going to buy it again! It really works</li>
    <li> I received this vitamin C serum for testing purposes. The serum is cased in a blue bottle with a medicinal dropper. The serum is clear yet creamy and absorbs into the skin and has a citrus scent to it but quickly fades away. It does leave your skin very soft and moisturized without an oily feeling. I can honestly say I like this serum because it contains vitamin C , tea tree oil, salicylic acid which is great for acne and the powerful anti aging retinol. This serum has it all and the results will be known after prolonged use.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  No irritation, and it truly brightened my winter-dull aging skin</li>
    <li> The best serum that ever happened to me! Love how it revitalizes my face and back (where I udually apply it). If I have any cuts or acne, I feel the salicylic acid tingling and working. Blemishes and dark spots have been disappearing rapidly. It&#x27;s just an amazing serum!!</li>
    <li> As a 37 year old single man I realized it was time to do something about my skin.  I&#x27;ve always just washed with bar soap and thrown some lotion and or acne meds when I needed it.  My skin didn&#x27;t look terrible by any means, but I am getting older and there were some lines forming around my eyes and I decided I should head off further signs of aging as much as possible. I bought this product, their eye serum, toner, retinol moisturizer and the Emu Oil.  I highly recommend all of their products.  After less than a month of use I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in the look and feel of my skin.  The tone, texture and coloring have all improved.  The lines around my eyes have been visibly reduced.  I occasionally get some acne so I was pleased that this product has Salicylic Acid in it.  I intend to continue to use all of the Insta Natural products I have purchased.  They&#x27;re a great value!</li>
    <li> Loving this stuff after 3 weeks! My spots are fading, yay! Had a pretty bad one right in the middle of my cheek and its barely visible now. Also my pores are smaller in the morning. Im only doing at night for now, but might add daytime as well. It has a nice citrus smell too. Great buy. I was purchasing Image fading serum before and this is half the price. Yippee!</li>
    <li> I find my skin likes this stuff. No breakouts, and the tone of my skin seems clearer.  Feels good. Dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I personally love this serum. When I apply it, it makes my skin feel hydrated and soft. I also feel my skin tightening after each application. This serum can be drying because of the sylicylic acid and retinol in it. It has 2.5% retinol. So I apply the vitamin C serum as well for its oil properties to help hydrate my skin. My skin looks more firm and plump after about 5 days of using this. I use in in conjunction with other vitamin C products. My skin care routine includes this serum as well as the vitamin C serum, the clean and clear morning burst cleanser which also has vitamin C in it, and my clean and clear moisturizing gel. This is a vitamin C anti-aging power house routine. It deffinately works though. Vitamin C is a key ingredient in anti-aging skin care.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and leaves my skin silky smooth I noticed my blemishes going away and the extra dry spots gone! I received for testing and review purposes but I will purchase again when mine runs out</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Instanatural in general. I love that they use all natural ingredients. It is also obvious they have researched which ingredients are best to put together. It is very effective against acne while also reducing fine lines. I love how even my skintone was after using this serum! It also let my skin very hydrated. I appreciate that they sent me this item to review. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I am huge on skincare since I have had such a hard time with my skin in my early 20s.  Now in my 30s I notice that with a change in how I treat my skin, it has been so much better.  This product is easily applied, soaks into the skin nicely so I can apply other serums and I&#x27;m amazed with the price point considering the amount of product you will get.  I have used quite a few products from InstaNatural and this one holds its own like all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;I have received the product for review purposes but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> smells great.  feels great.  my complexion is smoother after 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> This serum is absolutely AMAZING!  There are many Vitamin C Serums on the market that make claims but this one lives up to it&#x27;s promise. Many of the Vit C serums are oxidized by the time you receive them which renders them ineffective. You can tell by the color of the serum if it is oxidized because it is dark brown or orange in color. This serum absorbs quickly and is not sticky like other products. This is a product that I would recommend to anyone interested in achieving or maintaining a youthful fresh glow and minimize aging or stressed skin.</li>
    <li> im very good with taking care of my skin but its not perfect ... I have oily skin with some acne scares with few active breakouts as well . My skin isent to bad but this made it from a 6 to an 8 and im exteamly happy with it and would defiantly purchase again</li>
    <li> I have to say, I really loved the way this felt on my skin.  I liked the way it smelled, and I honestly could tell a difference in the softness of my skin after using this product.  I tend to use too much of things, so it ran out somewhat quickly, but that was my fault.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> The instant I tried this product I was pleased. I love the smell, the texture and I swear after 3 uses started to see changes in the wrinkles around my eyes. No irritation at all and I have somewhat sensitive skin. I have very dry skin, and when using this before my moisturizer, it has improved the texture and dryness. No more tight feeling. The best part is, this Vit C Serum has all-natural ingredients. VERY important to me. Too many weird chemicals in skin care products anymore.&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural is a top quality company with excellent EXCELLENT customer service. I highly recommend. And will be using their other products too.</li>
    <li> If you follow my blog then you already know that I am a HUGE fan of InstaNatural products.  I have tried just about all their products now and I have yet to be disappointed.  The newest product I can add to the list is the Anti-Aging Skin Clearing Serum that InstaNatural sent me to review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always a good thing when a product does double duty and that is exactly what this Anti-Aging Skin Clearing Serum.  Not only does it help reverse the signs of aging it also helps with discoloration, redness, inflammation, and it even helps unclog pores.  I have been using the Anti-Aging Skin Clearing Serum for about 3 weeks and I have had great results.  I alternate using the serum between my morning and nightly skincare routines so I am only using it once a day.  The serum is really lightweight and absorbs easily into the skin and my skin feels &amp; looks smoother and it even feels more nourished.  I have also noticed that a few of my old acne spots are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, another product to add to the growing list of great products from InstaNatural!</li>
    <li> Beautiful serum. Amazing.. I waited more than a month to write this review. Glowing skin. Not too sticky.. But only little bit. It get absorbed quickly. A little bit goes long way. I wish they had international shipping</li>
    <li> I used this product at night, after cleansing and toning, before moisturizing. After giving birth, I went through periods of having mini breakouts. Since using this serum, my skin is clear and I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in fine lines. I also really like how the product feels and smells, which really encourages me to use it, making it even more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the products for review free of charge. I was not compensated in any other way. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have not notice any change yet, but is willing to give this product a chance.</li>
    <li> This definitely helped with hyper-pigmentation problems, but also caused the areas I used it on to break out intensely. I am not usually prone to acne so this was rather surprising for me. I think the product is still worth it overall if you are looking to improve the appearance of scars</li>
    <li> This product was working wonderful but then I started having a reaction to the retinol. Besides that I would still be using this product.</li>
    <li> My skin has been changing lately and have struggled with some dry cheeks and breakouts along my jawline. I dropped all my facial care products to try out Inset Naturals&#x27; products. This Vitamin C Serum with Retinol has worked great at cleaning up my jawline. There were a few blemishes (pimples &amp; remnant marks from recent pimples) I have had for over a month that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I can hardly see the marks &amp; have only been using the product for about 2 weeks. Great quality and beyond excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of acne just fine.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product, it has a great list of ingredients. However, it really really dried out my skin. I used it once a day 5 or 6 times a week for about 2 weeks. I just thought my skin was dry for some unknown reason until I decided to stop using this product for a couple weeks. My skin got back to near normal so I decided maybe if I just use it a couple times a week it wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Wrong. I used it just one more time and once again the area I used it on was flaking and very dry. I do not have sensitive skin normally but I must be sensitive to something in this product. I bet it works great for some, bummer it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I really am impressed with this product! I have been using it for a month and I gave noticed clearer and more even skin! I would definitely buy it again!!! It has a light citrus smell, white appearance and goes on without stickiness. It did dry out my sensitive skin if I used it twice a day, so I switched to only bedtime ( and apply a moisturizer soon after).&lt;br /&gt;The company sent a very  nice email detailing what I should expect from the product and how to get the most out of it. I was very impressed!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!! I use a derma roller and then apply this 3 times a week at night. Smells great! Have only been using this for a dew weeks but can already see that the sun spots on my forehead are much lighter!</li>
    <li> I like your product because I can finally use moisturizers on my&lt;br /&gt;face without breaking out. I use this product after I take a shower, I let&lt;br /&gt;the serum dry while I dress up, and before I leave for work I put on my&lt;br /&gt;daily moisturizer. It contains both salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid. One&lt;br /&gt;is to prevent me from breaking out and the other helps my skin stay&lt;br /&gt;elastic. Thank you for offering such product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and swear by it. Plan to restock soon.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 3 weeks and the texture and look of my skin has improved.  I use once a day, in the morning before applying make-up.</li>
    <li> This serum helped a lot  with my dull skin problem. It can make your face a little sensitive, so make sure to use sunscreen at day to avoid any sun spots (it doesn&#x27;t matter it&#x27;s winter or raining). I highly recommend it if you want to brighten your skin, and remove acne spots or any spots you may have. I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanna know more? Read the article at: http://whataboutetc.blogspot.com/2014/12/review-new-insta-natural-skin.html</li>
    <li> I have been using your product and I believe I am seeing an improvement in my skin. My face feels and looks smoother, the pores appear smaller and the chin acne is clearing. My chin is somewhat dry, but I feel once the acne is under control, the dryness will be relieved.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My skin is smoother and much healthier looking. I have on ly been using it for a few weeks but I have seen a great deal of difference in my skin. My blemishes are also fading away.</li>
    <li> It took forever, but I found it. The formula that actually does make my skin fresher and younger looking. I wish I had taken a before pic to show results - after only a month. But I have to say, I notice the results right away! I wish I had found this a long time ago! Love the smell, and the feel on my skin. Once it dries I put on my moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go - to bed. I do not put on in the morning, maybe I should...</li>
    <li> really enjoyed this and it helped my skin wonderfully</li>
    <li> This did not help my skin at all. it actually made it break out way worse I was better off just using Aztec Healing Clay every night before bed I will be returning this and trying something else.</li>
    <li> My experience with Vit C Serum has been amazing. I received the product unexpectedly very quickly. The package is nice and secure with thick bubble wrap. I am in my mid 30s and have always had skin problems especially acne scars and uneven skin tone esp. around my jaw line that has darker color than my face.I have been using the Vit C Serum for 2 months and I have gradually been seeing positive results everyday. I highly satisfy with the effect it has on my skin. That made me feel so good that I did work well on my skin tone and my scar acne had faded. Amazing product and can recommend to anyone. I will definitely get more bottles when the first one is finished :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and have seen noticeable improvement in the deep red rosacea on my cheeks. The rosacea spots have faded and overall become significantly smaller. Further, the product is easy to apply and has a pleasant aroma to it. With that being said, the product seems to be causing me to breakout pretty badly on my chin. I&#x27;m going to give it a little more time but may have to discontinue use if these breakouts continue.</li>
    <li> A few drops go a long way, and I have noticed my skin improving in overall tone &amp; texture since I added this to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I really like InstaNatural products. The Vitamin C serum has really helped to brighten my skin. Like other vitamin c products, there is a strange smell after about 20 minutes. That doesn&#x27;t keep me from using it though, as the results far outweigh the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product takes all dryness away and gives skin a smooth healthy glow. As far as acne I see a slight improvement does help pimples heal faster but in no way does this product &amp;#34; control&amp;#34; acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with his product.  My skin looks brighter and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> Im buying my 2nd bottle... I absolutely love this product! Amazing results</li>
    <li> Nice serum for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> great product. works wonders on my skin and I love the results I have been getting from it.</li>
    <li> Seriously one of the best serum I have ever used! I got this free to write an honest review, and I love it. Many friends have told me my skin is glowing, which is a good thing after you hit 40! I will be purchasing this when I run out. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Great product!  I could see results in a week. As good if not better than the expensive products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a four because I have only used it a short while . It might be five.</li>
    <li> Works great. Face feels toned, and the beginnings of wrinkles around the eyes are being held at bay, noticeably. Goes on well under any cream, day or night.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and very easy to apply! It&#x27;s light and does not feel greasy. My acne is much more under control but not completely gone. I have alot of redness and scarring so hopefully it can help with that too.</li>
    <li> Used the entired bottle and didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
    <li> Having used this for about 2 months now, I haven&#x27;t really noticed a major difference in my complexion. I originally bought this based on the reviews and was hoping it would help clear up the hyperpigmentation I have left from my acne and to prevent future breakouts. This didn&#x27;t clear up my skin or seem to bring about any improvement. I thought that the texture of the serum was weird as when it is applied to the face, it leaves a sticky residue. To me, it&#x27;s bearable, but can be quite annoying especially when layering with other skincare products. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I started seeing differences in less than a week of using it. My skin feels brighter and smoother. I notice a small change in acne flare outs, but perhaps I have not given it enough time. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this product three times which goes to show how much I love it. Everything down to its fruity smell is amazing, and it always leaves my skin so pristine.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, finished the whole bottle and no change , I don&#x27;t understand all this positive reviews came from !!??</li>
    <li> So for the past few months I was breaking out like crazy , and being left with dark acne scars on my face . Id cover them up with concealer but it was honestly getting frustrating . So I started looking for a product to help with the scarring and my acne and I came across this wonderful product . I been using this product for 8 days now , morning and night and I believe to see some progress which makes me a very happy customer . The left side of the picture is my AFTER (just 8 days) and the right side was my BEFORE</li>
    <li> Love this! I tend to use it once a week. It has salicylic acid, which is great for blemishes, and Vitamin C works really well for clearing up my acne scars. Also, the hyaluronic acid is very hydrating and feels wonderful on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: this product was sent for review. All opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> Amazing for my skin! Cleared up mild acne but still kept my skin moisturised without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I got this because my friend recommended it to me. She said that this serum will help dry up my pimples and will clear my face from pimple scar. So, I gave it a try.  I loved the way this felt on my skin and I liked the way it smelled. And more than a week of using it I saw difference on my face. My pimples dried up and and my skin feels firmer but unfortunately I dropped the bottle and serum spilled on the floor :(</li>
    <li> I use this nightly, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My skin is so happy. Fine lines and scars are just disappearing like crazy. I recommend this to anyone looking for a vitamin c/retinol serum!</li>
    <li> awesome product. can feel the change immediately.</li>
    <li> I recently used this product.  It smells lovely and feels great on my skin.  I cannot attest to any difference yet as I just started using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum in order to even my skin tone.  Serum definitely exfoliates the skin in order to fade dark spots and even skin tone.  Be careful when using this product in conjunction with other products such as peels and glycolic acid creams.  I had to back off a bit because the combination was too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I see any results but my skin feels really healthy.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product. I think my skin is softer and skin spots are lightening just a smidge.</li>
    <li> I just got it.  I used it 4 times in the last 2 days.  It just amazing. Can&#x27;t wait how is my face gonna look after 2 weeks.  Just love it.</li>
    <li> Light, and smells pleasant.</li>
    <li> makes my skin clearer, brighter. It has a nice smell  and goes on easily with just a few drops.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased to receive my serum hot. As soon as it arrived, I opened the box to find the bottle feeling very hot. I doubt the serum is worth using now. I&#x27;m very disappointed and feel I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> My partner began using this product on his face as well as his shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to diminish dark as well as aging spots. This was noticed on the shoulder area after year of sun exposure. Three weeks after using this product this spot were softened but not completely gone. The results were not dramatic but they were noticeable.</li>
    <li> Glows and helps skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at full price, not part of a bargain deal to leave a review. The bottle looks smaller than I was expecting, however for a month I have been putting it on my freshly-washed face at night, before a moisturizer and there is still about half a bottle left. I don&#x27;t mind the dropper bottle. I am 28, fair-skinned Caucasian with minimal monthly acne occasionally on my chin area. Although I am really generally really fair-skinned, my cheeks &amp; jawbone area are more pink/red than the rest of my face skin. When I used this product the very first time I put it on and was getting some things done in the kitchen while it dried, before moisturizer. Usually any skin product makes the pinkness on my cheeks brighter but when I went back to look in the mirror and put on the moisturizer my face wasn&#x27;t pink at all! I was shocked. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but this stuff really evens out my skin tone and makes it look more normal.  When I got this product I also got the Eye Serum and a moisturizer from a different brand. I began using them all at once and had a week or so of little things pop up here &amp; there but I think that was just the bad stuff coming to the surface. Since then, I have noticed a great improvement in the general smoothness of my skin, even tone (reduced redness), and through this last window of opportunity for my monthly hormone acne to show up, it didn&#x27;t! (i&#x27;m also drinking Raspberry Leaf tea regularly, which I&#x27;ve heard helps regulate hormones). I love this stuff, it&#x27;s part of my routine, even for my fair/sensitive/ oily Tzone/ dry cheeks/ occasional acne skin.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! It has all of the greatest ingredients in one bottle so I don&#x27;t have to layer on different products. I also love that it combines anti-aging with breakout control. Since using this serum, not a single zit has reared it&#x27;s ugly head (no pun intended) and my skin feels smooth, hydrated, and even-toned with no redness. This is the perfect product, and this is coming from someone in the beauty industry who has access to many professional, expensive beauty products and I have tried many of them. I look forward to trying the cleanser and moisturizer soon!</li>
    <li> I use this along with the moisturizer and the combination works great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum by InstaNatural. I have been using the serum for several days and notice a remarkable improvement on the discoloration around my nose area. Additionally, my complexion is brighter and smoother than before. I have already recommended the serum to my friend who has age spots issue. The serum is an excellent skin care product at a fractional price.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My daughter who&#x27;s skin has blemishes is now clearing. Ordering 1 for each of my girls!</li>
    <li> I have combination/oily skin and the occassional breakout. I also have some minimal scarring due to years of sufferring with more severe acne. I have been looking for something that can keep pimples away, help with scarring, and also improve my overall complexion - and this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is light and fresh when applied. It has a great scent unlike other creams that I&#x27;ve used in the past. The best thing about it is that it has TON of natural ingredients that can help with acne as well as reversing the signs of aging. Before I had one cream for pimples, another for wrinkles, and layering these on top of each other was gross. This is now my go to morning and night product. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention that Instanatural&#x27;s customer service is FANTASTIC. I sent them an email to ask if my serum was still good because my cat knocked over the bottle and the cap came off; the serum was exposed to air all day until I got home from work and I was worried that it had oxidized. An Instanatural rep replied saying that they were sending me a complimentary replacement bottle. They&#x27;re AWESOME.</li>
    <li> This makes me cry! How can they not advertise this? It works so well. I have suffered with acne here in the Keys since I moved here. This clears it up immediately. I know it works because I ran out and bam! Disaster! I am 40 and have deep acne if I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks so much younger. Use this and drink a gallon a day!</li>
    <li> This clears my face quickly and seems to make it smooth. The smell is great also.</li>
    <li> Felt it begin to tingle after applied and the aroma was very well tolerated</li>
    <li> There are many reviews praising the effects of this serum, but I want to touch on something else.  The guarantee for the serum is absolutely sound, and the customer service / follow-up by the company is superior.</li>
    <li> I have been having major breakouts but this serum has certainly made a difference. Will keep using</li>
    <li> This may work but the thing that I have a problem with is the altered product picture which has been photoshopped to make the bottle look bigger than it actually is.  This is a standard 1 fl oz bottle but the top cap has been deliberately shrunk to make the overall bottle appear larger.  I thought at first it was just the aspect that had been changed to make it look squatter, but no the top was deliberately altered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture with the bottle on the left is what is advertised the right is the bottle with the correct proportions.</li>
    <li> Brown spots on my skin as fast disappearing, great serum.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have gotten so many compliments on my skin recently too. Thanks for making a great product and for not charging a ridiculous price for it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product because it has some AWESOME ingredients. Unfortunately if you&#x27;re sensitive to Vitamin C like I am, this may not work for you. I ended up with a rash of fine bumps all over my face. It did make my skin look radiant underneath the rash though lol. It definitely does clear blemishes and lighten dark spots.. It just has too much vitamin c for my skin. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great for others without the sensitivity though.&lt;br /&gt;I hate to through it out because it&#x27;s such a quality product.</li>
    <li> After about 2 month using it, my friends notice the differences and ask what cream I&#x27;m using for my face. This serum make my skin brighter and little bit tighter. It fades dark spots/ acne scars slightly.  It does not irritate or burn my skin. I have oil skin and tend have breakouts on forehead and chin.  Makeup and some foods cause acne breakouts on my face. This serum does not trigger breakouts.  My skin still have dark sports/acne scars on chin.  Thus, I will to try  InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum For Face 20% which have stem cell and vitamin E  to see if it can fade acne scars faster or not.</li>
    <li> great product. goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. great addition to my morning and evening beauty routine.</li>
    <li> sofar so good, thank you</li>
    <li> I love the smooth feeling this leaves on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I noticed a change in my complextion within the first week of using it. I have acne prone skin with hyperpigmentation and this product is very effective for clearing up breakouts and lightening the hyperpigmentation. To my experience the results are comparable to having a facial done by an estitician.</li>
    <li> I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I will say that I have only been using this product for two weeks. I will update my rating if after a longer time I feel like it&#x27;s, uh, age-defying and skin-clearing. The seller emailed me after my purchase with instructions on how to use the product, which was nice. Right now I can only use this product once daily (actually at night). I use this in conjunction with a great moisturizer. I don&#x27;t wear the serum outside in the sun. So I don&#x27;t know why IT BURNS SO BAD other than, you know, having acids in it. And when I wake up in the morning skin is falling off my face. Um. I know it sounds crazy that I&#x27;m still using the product but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just an adjustment period? Like, um. It&#x27;s, uh, resurfacing my skin? Haha. My husband chastises me for still using it. I may actually have to stop using it because it really hurts. I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin. And my face is usually oily, so. Wow. This stuff. yeah, I&#x27;m probably being an idiot.</li>
    <li> For the first week, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my complexion or breakouts. But during the second week, all of my red marks slowly began to fade away. Others have commented that I look very &amp;#34;lively&amp;#34; (before I guess I looked tired?). In any case, I haven&#x27;t had any problems since. The serum makes the skin very soft and supple. Also, I used more than the recommended amount because my marks were pretty significant.</li>
    <li> I see a great difference in brown spot fading, in the brightness and the smoothness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well with my acne- prone skin</li>
    <li> I enjoy this serum. It is moisturizing, exfoliating, and evens my skin tone. My only qualm is that it has both retinol and salicylic acid in the same product which makes it too harsh for me to use daily. I use this about 3X a week. I wish they made a version without retinol.  Update: April 20th Something in this serum is just too harsh for my skin. Even when I space out the applications, my skin just doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable even though it looks more even and brighter. I suspect it could due to its ph of 8 which is pretty high for a serum.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a little skeptical buying this line of products, I have tried SO many over the years.  I&#x27;m not looking for a miracle, I&#x27;m looking for a &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; product to do a good job treating my skin, increasing cell turnover &amp; exfoliation etc.  So far, I really love this serum - it looks sort of milky when it comes out of the dropper, is easy to smooth on your skin and dries pretty quickly.  I use it at night, though I imagine you could use it day and night, and i use it with the eye serum (which is a shocking orange!) and then in the morning I use the eye gel under moisturizer.  LOVE this line, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and seems to do an excellent job - recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this a week or so and it seems that my sun spots are getting lighter.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works better than the expensive spread. Really nice product. I will certainly buy more from InstaNatural when the need arises!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to even my skin tone and THIS is the one I&#x27;m sticking with. I have used it morning and night for almost 2 weeks and I literally feel like I have new PERFECT skin, it&#x27;s almost flawless. I don&#x27;t even need foundation now. ..and let&#x27;s just say this works on more places than just your face!  I will most definitely be buying more of this</li>
    <li> This product is terrific! I saw results within the first week of use. Added bonus,  it smells great too. I had tried a couple of other serums before finding this, and none seemed to have to same quality. I was contacted within a few days of my order by the company,  checking to be certain I was satisfied. It&#x27;s refreshing to find a company that seems to genuinely care,  and isn&#x27;t just driven by the bottom line. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Im 30 years old and I still get blemishes here and there. But recently I broke out like crazy and I was going to buy anything to control this awful hot mess on my face. I never take the time to review products, but this one is well worth my time! It has helped me clear up my skin immensely and within 2-3 day I saw wonderful results!  It has also helped with old acne spots. I am olive skin toned so after getting a blemish my skin will get darker in that area. I used this once to twice a day. I&#x27;ll rinse my face in the morning and put the serum on and at night after washing my face with philosophy ( which is another product I highly recommend if you get breakouts here and there)&lt;br /&gt;I even got compliments at work about my complexion; which hasn&#x27;t happened for a while. I have to say this is a forever product and I will keep buying this magic in a bottle FOREVER!</li>
    <li> I have used this product only a few times but so far so good. I like that it dries fast on the skin and doesn&#x27;t irritare my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a week but face is clearer using this plus AHA oil-free cream as a moisturizer.  I tend to get one new pimple a day and nothing so far.  I&#x27;m literally holding my breath.  I&#x27;ll re-post after a month.  Also am using Dr. Lin&#x27;s acne wipes before the serum to clear my pores without alcohol.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  I see my lines fading away, and my skin is soooo soft.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that the dark pigmentation spots are fading.  Highly, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this product is good,hopefully with time of use,the wrinkles will be minimized.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product a short time that is why I am giving it a 4 star rating, I don&#x27;t feel qualified to rate it 5 stars yet. I will say I love the way it makes my face and neck feel and love the orange fragrance of the vitamin C. I will definitely re-order this product. I feel it&#x27;s contents and long term use will improve the appearance of my complexion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Already been through a whole bottle. Significantly reduced my acne and acne scars. Will be a product I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Really makes your skin feel soft and supple. Take very little product in my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> So far the best product in its kind out there and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for several weeks and have ordered another bottle.  I love it!  It has improved my skins clarity as well as helped to keep blemishes away.  I will continue to buy and use.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  I have had problem skin all my life and it has not gone away in my 40&#x27;s.  Eating well and exercise make a huge difference but this is my secret weapon now and I am glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this for a little while before doing a review to give it a fair evaluation.  I can now say that this product really works well and does what it is intended to do.  It is fairly strong so you may have to begin with every other night application until it doesn&#x27;t sting - or whatever schedule works best for you - but I believe that my skin is looking clearer and my blackheads are finally starting to go away. I would recommend this product and the InstaNatural company is a very good company to do business with.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I do see a difference in my skin and the product arrived in a timely manner. I would recommend this seller and product.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful and nourishing product for the face. I have been using for a couple of weeks and my face looks brighter and a few brown spots look a little lighter. It also has lots of incredible ingredients that are natural and good for you. I just ordered my second bottle. Your business will do well. Also it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a month. My skin is noticeably softer and my skin tone seems to be slightly more even. This serum absorbs into my skin very quickly and does not leave any residue at all. I put this on at night and wake up with my face feeling and looking refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about this serum and all of Instanatural&#x27;s products is that their ingredients seem to be high quality and contain natural ingredients such as essential oils and carrier oils.  Also, just in case this information is not out there, this particular serum has 10% hyaluronic acid.  This product is something I am so glad to have found. The customer service is also excellent. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My face just drinks this stuff in!  Also helps control my acne.</li>
    <li> O.k. first things first I did not get this product for my opinion or as everything I look up just about on amazon and now this product says they recievrd this product tor there opinion I am not one of the fake reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t leave feedback on nh first bottle I purchased because it takes awhile to see a difference but I ordered my second bottle and I like it it has changed the look of my skin it&#x27;s less uneven looking and it does help with blemishes. And I think its helping a bit with my deep wrinkles I am 50 years old and a smoker so far so good.Anyway. I would love to be able yo try products for my opinion on them especially this line but I think I am one of the only reviews that didnt eouldget yheres forgdoesn&#x27;t say</li>
    <li> Tightens skin very well. Good quality and great product.</li>
    <li> It breaks my heart to say this, and only this: it totally broke me out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, and I greatly enjoy the moisture this product helped restore &amp; maintain. Using as directed though, I&#x27;ve found that none of my brown skin discoloration had lightened/lessened, and I also do not notice that this product helps with my adult acne once it comes to the surface. The moisture was my primary concern, acne second, discoloration third. Even though this product didn&#x27;t preform as it claimed it would, the moisture was of utmost importance to me, and it DOES help reduce the frequency and overall severity of my acne.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It goes on very smoothly. I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Been using this serum for about a week now,and j must say that u absolutely love it.My skin is very soft and moisturized much clearer than it was.My skin is in such better shape since using instanatural  products.You only use a little, it goes on smooth,no irritation, redness ,nothing.My age marks are getting very light thanks to this serum.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
    <li> Even as an adult, I get the occasional blemish on my face.  I have used this a few times on blemishes at night, and notice a substantial improvement in the morning.</li>
    <li> Oh - oh oh ohhh. You&#x27;ve got to feel it and see it. Noticeable difference within hours. Definately does exactly what it says. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. Your face, throat and neck will love you for it. I use it every night. Oh what a difference.</li>
    <li> The serum feels smooth and promoted healing oof a couple of stubborn acne scars. TThe orange oil aroma is quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> So very happy with this product!!!  Excellent product, excellent service!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This serum is definitely helping hydrate my skin during the winter. Great with moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> I use this every other morning after I&#x27;ve showered and before putting lotion on.  Works great in keeping my face healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but my acne seems to be clearing up. Product is lightweight and has a pleasant citrus smell.</li>
    <li> This serum is the best product I have ever bought for my skin. I am on my second bottle now, and I can&#x27;t imagine going without it again. I use it morning and night (just make sure to use sunscreen religiously since it contains retinol). My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was in third grade. The pores on my nose and my cheeks have decreased in ways that I never thought they would. It makes my skin feel soooo soft and smooth! You won&#x27;t regret this product!</li>
    <li> my skin has never looked better. i am a 21 year old asian female with allergy sensitive, extremely oily, acne-prone, small but many whitehead pimples, huge pores, and clogged pores skin. i have been suffering from moderate acne for 7 years! this is the clearest it has ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been on benozyl peroxide for about 7 years now. it kept about 60% of my acne at bay, but i always had the pimples on my face that never went away. i have extremely extremely EXTREMELY oily skin that also has dry patches from benozyl peroxide. my skin became dependent on benozyl peroxide and would break out when i tried to go without it. i have been trying to find something to replace it for a while and i am so glad that i tried this serum because this is the best that i have seen my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the beginning, i had a break out and initial purge from the serum. i was discouraged but i persisted and tried to wait it out although my skin was covered in pimples. in about a week and a half, my skin started to clear up slowly but surely! it has only been about 2 weeks since i have used it and i am so excited to see what else it can do for me. my skin is less oily!! exponentially. my skin tone is evening out, and best of all my acne is starting to clear up. so excited to buy my next bottle.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my mom</li>
    <li> LOVE IT....I can smell the vitamin C-which I have found is wonderful for my skin. I see my skin transforming-kind of a glow.&lt;br /&gt;As with anything you have to give it time to work! RECOMMEND this..</li>
    <li> I love it !!! Consistency is great and It starts working the minute you apply it !!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks or so and I can see a big difference. The dark spots I have on my face are actually a lot lighter. I&#x27;ve also noticed some of my wrinkles are less profound.</li>
    <li> Bought this for spot treating acne. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything but irritate and dry out my skin- even when following with a moisturizer. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> New and like the ingredients as well...continue with this one for sure</li>
    <li> This, combined with saw palmetto, has really improved the quality of my skin. I will be reordering. All blemishes disappeared within a few weeks.</li>
    <li> My face appeared a large swelling, very scary, is this normal? How should I do?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum. With nightly use, it has faded my facial scarring and has tightened the lines under my eyes. Overall, my face looks brighter and younger. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Works great on acne prone areas!</li>
    <li> Expensive and very small :(</li>
    <li> Cleared, brightened, smoothed, erased wrinkles.  I am thrilled.  After just month of use even other people notice the change.  This product is great and does not clog pores.  On top of it I always have had large pores my entire life.  I am almost 60 and never found a product that truly does make pores smaller until this one. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the InstaNatural products.  Best serum out there!</li>
    <li> Will never buy it again! Cheap and make skin oily and gives not fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my teenage son who has severe acne.  He has been using this product for about 4 weeks now and his skin has GREATLY improved.  He feels more confident now and actually makes eye contact now when speaking to someone.  If you have tried everything else and nothing has worked for your acne, give this a try!</li>
    <li> Holy cow, customer service at this place swept me off my feet! I made a mistake and confused two different products. Long story short I thought this product came in two different sizes and I had ordered the bigger one, but received the smaller version. Totally my bad. I contacted customer service and they took care of me magnificently. I&#x27;m a huge fan of good customer service and in the past I even discontinued using things I really liked because I was treated poorly. But in this case, I&#x27;m actually pretty amazed. As for the product, I love it. It smells wonderful and really left my skin smooth and fresh looking. I&#x27;ve been having some minor issues with random acne, I think caused by stress, so I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. I tried it for the first time last night and I can&#x27;t believe it already made a difference. I had a stubborn zit on my jaw and, to my surprise, this morning it was dried up and faded away. I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;m going to recommend this serum to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This works with time. I used this a month before writing a review. They recommended using it at least twice a day, but I only used it before going to bed. The results are slow but you will see the results within 2 to 3 weeks depending on your skin type.</li>
    <li> Really disappointing, somehow this product worsened my skin and caused it to be more oily which led my face to have more breakouts. Would not suggest this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it! My breakouts have minimized and are almost completely gone! Also the breakouts that do sometimes occur are gone so quickly and my skin is left soft and no ugly red marks! Never going to stop using this product!</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning and it smells nice and has helped reduced my breakouts.  Plus it nourishes the skin.  Great product and I will buy again!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it has not made one bit of difference😩</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin clear from blemishes and keeps it tight.  Love this stuff and its not overpriced (thank you!).</li>
    <li> Caused redness and burning</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a short time and yet I am seeing a difference in my skin. My face is really soft. The sun spot on my cheek that really bothered me is getting smaller! So far, I really like it.</li>
    <li> Best serum I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes your skin look super clean and fabulous.</li>
    <li> So Far I have used this product for almost 2 weeks. And I do see a very, nice improvement! I will provide an update after a month or so. But My skin does have a nice glow and it feels clean.</li>
    <li> I am totally hooked on this serum. I use it daily around my eyes, and other areas that are showing signs of my advancing age  :&amp;#60;(  It is a bit shiny at first, but soaks in quickly and I apply a moisturizer on right over it for additional protection. My finle lines are kept under control, and some have diminished a bit. I have rosacea, and it does not affect me at all. .I ordered a second bottle as my first one got low, and will definitely continue using it. I go to a med spa occasionally for dermabrasion and they sell a crazy-expensive version of this same product. Don&#x27;t spend more money than you have to-- this product does the trick.  Roll the calendar ahead three months:  I ordered another bottle even before the first was gone. I didn&#x27;t want to run out. Totally  love this stuff. My dermatologist gave me a complimentary bottle of a vitamin C serum that would be crazy-expensive to buy. I like the InstaNatural much better!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this... But need more time to see results of ingredients...</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Customer service was spot on though with their money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> Makes my skins feel amazing and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
    <li> good quality, love it! very effective</li>
    <li> it makes my skin looks brighter. it smells good.</li>
    <li> I have used almost the full bottle applying at night.  I can&#x27;t say I see any difference.  Several acne dark spots that I had hoped to lighten are the same.</li>
    <li> I love the product !!!</li>
    <li> Money well spent. Will be buying more. Pure natural ingredients that the ski is made from/off</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom and she is in love with this serum!! I can notice the difference is her skin!</li>
    <li> i am on my 2nd bottle of this product. It works really well, probably better than any other acne product I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it 2ce a day, morning and night after cleansing and before applying a moisturizer. My skin no longer has blackheads and the acne scars are fading fast. The serum made me break out at first, as is true of retinol products, but after that initial &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; phase which lasted 2-3 weeks I no longer break out and my skin is really clear. I use this in combination with a clay mask (I use the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Mask once or 2ce a week). I strongly recommend this product. It&#x27;s excellent!</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the hype is about.  I like it, smells good, but that&#x27;s about it. Probably won&#x27;t buy again at this price.</li>
    <li> Been three weeks haven&#x27;t seen muchhhh</li>
    <li> Holy mother of God! I have applied this only twice and my marionette puppet lines are gone! Really? I am 55 and despise getting old. All I wanted was a temporary reprieve from looking like droopy dog. I wish they made this in a bubble bath! I want to bathe in this. It&#x27;s light, smells light. I have extremely sensitive skin and this is light and gentle. I am truly in awe as I have been disappointed in so many products.  I use this in conjunction with Miravage advanced rewind serum and Oz Naturals Super Youth Retinol moisturizer. Also the Oz super youth eye gel. I almost hesitate to give such a great review because I don&#x27;t want to contribute to a price increase. I will order this again and again and again!</li>
    <li> Very good really like it</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome! Apply morning and night and you will see the difference in a couple of days! Love it and will continue to use it! I have VERY sensitive skin and Rosacea and this has cleared it up beautifully with no irritation at all!</li>
    <li> I will be ordering this product again!  It has helped reduce the severity of my acne breakouts, keeping my acne at bay.  I have been using this product for a month, and my skin is clearer, brighter and softer.  It&#x27;s a must have skin care item!</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I am 57 with hormonal acne and have sensitive skin.  Alot of products burn my skin or do not help.  I noticed fewer breakouts in the first two weeks.  I use it once a day at night. It is not oily. When you first put it on it smells of lemon, but the scent quickly goes away. I  recommend this product and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is helping to lighten the brown spots on my face.</li>
    <li> This product is a MUST in my acne clearing regime. I will shortly explain my journey so it can hopefully be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even begin to explain how much of a difference this serum has made on my skin! After a long time of chronic acne, and cystic around my jawline, I went through a year of purging with clay masks and finally started taking Turmeric extract. At this point I changed my facial regime to using Trader Joe&#x27;s cleaning facial wipes (with tea tree oil) and this Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum morning and night following the wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it crucial to eliminate dairy, refined carbs, and soy from my diet. Each time I relapse and eat any of it I get a breakout, mostly along my jawline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say my skin is finally 90% clear. I still have some deep pocket scarring on my cheeks and nose, but all the dark spots around my jawline and rest of my face have disappeared! And I hardly every get a break out, if I do it&#x27;s diet related and keeping up with my routine with the turmeric, facial wipes, and serum helps immensely. It heals in half the time and it&#x27;s never inflamed and deep like it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that it&#x27;s best to not wash my face with any soaps, and to be careful not to apply anything else to it, but perhaps just a splash of water if needed between morning and night. Being careful of hair products you use that come near your face and not constantly touching your face is also another good pointer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this serum goes on smoothly, a little goes a long way, and it makes my skin feel amazingly smooth and rejuvenated. The glow and even tone is immediately visible, and with only a week of use I could see a HUGE difference in the even tone of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in serious disbelief that I finally found something that ACTUALLY works without adding to my breakouts and inflammation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great investment for your skin, I say go for it!</li>
    <li> This has been the best purchase. I love the product. I have combination skin and nothing works. I had severe breakouts on my forehead and chin and nothing I used was working. This not only cleared the breakouts but is also making my complexion even.</li>
    <li> Smells good but my skin broke out bad</li>
    <li> Holy Grail. Finally! I&#x27;m 38, and have PCOS. Despite being on birth control and 1.5 years of antibiotics (Roxythromycin), I still woke up to whiteheads every single morning. After one week of this serum, I&#x27;m finally not suffering from acneexhaustion, a drawerful of hope in a bottle or an empty wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combines all you need for clear skin, without layering and alternating numerous products. I can&#x27;t wait to simply see a couple of bottles in my drawer. No more experimenting. Thanks so much for putting me out of my misery!</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural’s products and I was excited to try this Anti-Aging Skin Clearing Serum. I am trying to fight the signs of aging as well as work on ridding my skin of a couple spots and every once and awhile I get some acne issues cropping up that I’d like to nip in the bud.&lt;br /&gt;Typically I need several different products to treat these issues that I have. I usually need products for anti-aging, products for the acne part, and other products for the spots I’d like to fade. It’s nice that this product can treat all of these problems vs. just one. I love multitaskers as unitaskers are a waste of counter space, for the most part (there are a few exceptions!).&lt;br /&gt;This serum came in a nice sized 1oz glass bottle with a dropper. I’m not a huge fan of droppers, but if the product is great I can overlook that fact. I think they sell pumpers you can add to bottles. Not entirely sure, however. In any event, this is a nice non-oily serum that’s more creamy and milky than most serums. It also has a nice orangey smell to it. It smoothed over my skin very nice and was quick to absorb. There was no greasy after feeling to this serum. My skin felt very nice and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product has worked wonderfully for my skin. It has been so much softer, smoother, and most importantly acne free! I am not entirely sure how it’s working for my fine lines, as they don’t seem to be going anywhere just yet. I think I need to keep using a little longer to see more of a difference; nothing will be a miracle cure for that! I do see a little bit of a difference in some of my dark spots- they aren’t near as dark as they had been (not that they were super dark). I really do love this product.</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old.  I originally thought this was the best, but over time it has caused incredible pore clogging and blackheads. Will not reorder.</li>
    <li> These two items are the BEST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE FOR MY FACIAL COMPLEXION!!!&lt;br /&gt;First let me start by saying with all honesty that I have never written a review about any skin care product.  I&#x27;ve tried very expensive to not so expensive:  StriVectin, Perricone MD, No.7, Lancome, Olay Regenerist, etc., etc.&lt;br /&gt;A little over a week ago I received my shipment of the InstaNatural Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum along with InstaNatural Premium Hydration Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  A couple of drops of each in the palm of my hand, mix them together and apply to my face and neck area in the a.m. and p.m.  Not only are the InstaNatural products very inexpensive, THEY WORK!!!  I have been very sick for the past three years and I can&#x27;t begin to tell you what a toll it has taken on my face and neck area.  So, I bought it all, I tried it all, and when I looked in the mirror the pale, wrinkled face continued to stare back at me.  After using the InstaNatural products for two or three days I knew in my heart I was on to something good!&lt;br /&gt;INSTANATURAL LLC - - - - THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THESE WONDERFUL PRODUCTS!</li>
    <li> This serum is excellent! Y already buy my second bottle!</li>
    <li> I just bought this, It doesn&#x27;t go on oily, so far so good, I&#x27;m In my first week :-)</li>
    <li> I dont usually wrirw revies but its been over a month I purchased I can tell my skin is lighter from old acne scars, the moisturizer is holding great and I wake up with baby sking I highly recommend</li>
    <li> This seems like a decent serum to me. It certainly has everthing that i want in a serum kind of rolled into one. it isn&#x27;t really moisturizing to me, but that is a good thing because I have oily skin anyway. Overalll, I am pleased, especially the price1</li>
    <li> First off, I might be a rare case.&lt;br /&gt;The morning after my first application of this serum, my skin was peeling all over my face. There were layers and patches of dead skin on my cheeks, forehead and the bottom of by nose. When I try to wash with cd water it hurt a lot. I have some slight marks where the skin peeled. Also, I think that the serum is reacting with moisturisers because I could smell sulphur the minute I apply Nivea moisturiser on top of this. Perhaps this is a quality control issue, or maybe I&#x27;m just not the right candidate for this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It leaves skin soft and supple without being greasy or full of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I am older and have developed a lot of weird little things on my face.  Every once in a while I try some kind of lotion.  This is the only stuff that seems to have done anything.  I&#x27;m buying it again . . .</li>
    <li> directions were to small to read. I haven&#x27;t use it long enough to see a difference I do really like this product. It gives me a youthful glow. I use it every other day. My skin is sensitive, and using it every day leaves my skin feeling to sensitive. I may need to use a different moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Helped my girlfriend out a lot. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite InstaNatural product out of the 3 I own.  I apply it after I have given my face a good scrub.  I feel a tingling sensation, which I love and it has not made me break out, which is another bonus.  Some of my old acne scars look a bit lighter.  I wish it was in a pump bottle.  I don&#x27;t like the dropper.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again unless they add a pump to it or I can be sure it is the serum helping my acne scars fade and not my daily face scrub.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum for those who suffer from mild to severe adult acne.  As so many products out there can cause dryness, dehydration, flakey skin, etc...As someone who has occasional breakouts I highly recommend this serum.  It helps heal blemishes and imperfections.  Most adult acne sufferers are looking for something to heal their blemishes in a soothing way...Not burn their face off like the products they used in their teens.  :)  If that sounds like you, I would not hesitate to order this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I am an esthetician, I still get blackheads like everyone else, esp. in the Summer.  The hotter is gets, the more I battle this problem.  After using this serum for a few weeks (I used it a full month before posting a review) I noticed fewer blackheads, less visible pores and my skin was not as oily.  I also appreciate the fact that spots where blemishes had been faded much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think those with oily skin or normal to oily skin (t-zone oil) would benefit most from this product.  While it is more soothing that most acne products, it might be too drying for those who have dry skin.  But I would still give it a try and see how it works for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month now. Twice a day (morning and night) and following up with a moisturizer.  I have acne marks, not deep scars or even dark brown marks, mine are mostly pink, red and some a lighter brown. I have NOT noticed any improvement concerning my discoloration. HOWEVER, this product has really done wonders with the skin surrounding those marks. Its given some sort of glow to it and has helped improved the texture of my skin. Since I bought it hoping to get rid of he marks I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this product again. Maybe down the road, once I get rid of my &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; would I start using this product again.</li>
    <li> Strong stuff. Seems to be working... improved skin tone. But I have to ease off every once in a while... strong and can be quite drying.</li>
    <li> Made a big difference. My skin feels soft and rejuvenated</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product for my son to combat his acne.  But I noticed it was age defying so I decided to try it myself.  Within a week, I noticed my skin was smoother, clearer and fine lines softened.  But, I&#x27;m most happy at how it has diminished my brown spots, a plus I had not even considered when using.  This product works better than just about anything I&#x27;ve used on the market, combined with a good moisturizer, this 56 year old mom is quite happy with my teenager&#x27;s acne product.</li>
    <li> I only use this during night time, as I read some where before that vitamin C should not be use during day time, sun light will cause you to become darker. Anyways, I use this vitamin C serum along with my hot/cold infuser, it is well absorb into my skin, skin feels brighter and acne scar seems to be lighter also. My forehead was really dry, which cause some crease lines, after 2 uses of this I notice it is not as dry n the lines are less visible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
    <li> makesvmy face feel smooth</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I thought this was worth a try. I am an adult in my mid 30&#x27;s and have combination skin.... along with that I have had some hormonal acne issues since my mid teens. I am getting older and continue to have a few pimples a month along with the start of some &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; and maybe lines/wrinkles. My first impression was positive. I like the scent. I like the feel of the product etc. BUT.... after a few days of use I started to break out like crazy. Like WAY worse than I have since puberty. Large, deep, cystic type pimples. I didn&#x27;t change anything else about my skin care routine (so clearly this product was the cause). I did continue to use it because my understanding was that there may be some initial issues. After three weeks my skin was terrible. I was honestly embarrassed to leave the house:(  I wish I would have taken a before and after pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a month for my skin to clear up after discontinuing the product. Also, once I realized that things were not getting better the option for return was no longer available. So, I am out $$ on a product that didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Obviously, based on other reviews, this is a good product for some. Just be aware that if you are going to give it a shot to make sure you are within the appropriate return time if you opt to return.</li>
    <li> I was interested in this item because not only does it have vitamin C, but it also has retinol and salasylic acid, which I had previously used in 3 separate products. I have acne-prone, combination skin with scarring. I can honestly say that this serum (used with the Vitamin C OR Retinol moisturizer) lightened my scarring more than other products. Skincare is important to me so it&#x27;s a big deal for me to say I will continue using this.</li>
    <li> Work just as indicated. Did make me break out a bit more in the beginning but that only lasted a couple of days before I noticed the pimples disappearing. My skin is soft and glowing. Smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have dry,  acne prone skin which is even more problematic in the winter months. This product has rescued my skin and is now revealing my true beautiful skin. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because of the great reviews. Unfortunately this serum is not for me. I have a very sensitive skin and after two nights of using it I had a horrible breakout on my face. If you have a sensitive skin this product is not for you.</li>
    <li> I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I&#x27;m 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It&#x27;s generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and then the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is great, and I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic improvement in my skin since I started using it, but sometimes it does cause minor irritations like blotching, minor itching and a little dryness. I only use it at night because of this and I always follow up with the night cream. If you have sensitive skin like I do, I do not recommend using this serum more than once a day.  I can say however, that there is a noticeable difference in my skins condition and appearance and I feel I look healthier than I ever have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ve never felt better about my own face and it&#x27;s because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s something about this line that just works for me and I&#x27;m so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it&#x27;s a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t been using this product on a daily basis, I still have seen a tremendous improvement with my skin. I suffer from moderate bacne which has left me with a lot of scars. I also get a lot of blackheads and sometimes break out with severe acne. Since using this product (again, not even on a daily basis!), my back is looking clearer than it has in years and I have stopped getting pimples (an occasional one here and there, but nothing compared to what was happening before). I will be making more of an effort to remember to apply this daily and also start using it more on my face since it seems to be providing good results for that as well. I highly recommend this product. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle! That being said, however, you only need to apply a little bit at a time and it will still work wonders. So glad I finally found something that works for my skin and isn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive.</li>
    <li> I compared this with two other Retinol products. This one really truly works. Overnight in the morning I have noticed a huge difference. I have been told by many people over and over that my face has changed to a much looking appearance. I have had zero negative reaction. I have been doing it for two times a week. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Stopped using Dr prescribed acne treatment and this worked just as well or maybe better...just make sure you use an oil free spf or you might burn due to the retinol.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month now and I must say that I absolutely love it and have already placed an order for another one. I have always struggled with breakouts, which can sometimes appear as cystic acne or smaller pimples. I have used many products previously to obtain clearer skin, some costing a fortune. However, this product, which I use along with the Retinol Moisturizer, has worked wonders for my skin. My skin is less oily than it used to be, it looks more refined and has a more even tone, and I have had very minimal breakouts since (mostly about the time of menstruation). It goes on easily and dries quickly and my face usually feels hydrated throughout. I use this product both day and night. Another reason I have given this product 5 stars is because of their amazing customer service. They respond to emails and also inquire about how their products are working. I will post updates as necessary, but since using this product along with the Retinol Moisturizer I have ditched my foundation and use powder only.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t find any difference using this product and it burns. Zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I wish I had know of this 20 yrs ago..</li>
    <li> my face was too far gone I ended up at a dermatologist and am being treated with oral antibiotics and a topical antibiotic and scar fader</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure this product out. I love that the company sent me an email on how to use the product. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference just after two weeks on the trouble spots on my face. But when it says stay out of the sun/use spf, you better do it! I forgot and my skin was super sensitive and it was a little painful. It didn&#x27;t last long but I will be more cautious going forward.</li>
    <li> I am african American and my acne scars are dark. My skin tone is ligt so I do see the spots getting a little lighter.  I have been using this for 4 weeks. I will buy again and see if they lighten more.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of use my skin is softer and acne diminished. I have already purchased 2 more bottles so that I never run out.</li>
    <li> This is not a miracle cure, but my break outs have cleared up dramatically. It smells nice, goes on smooth, and isn&#x27;t sticky. I use it in the morning and am able to apply my makeup over the top of it. I don&#x27;t know about anti-aging, but it is working for blemishes. I still get pimples but not as many. I have used about half a bottle and have already ordered a second tube. That says I am satisfied enough to continue using it. If you are having problem skin, I suggest giving it a try.</li>
    <li> It is an okay product. It didn&#x27;t do any magic to my skin despite wearing religiously.</li>
    <li> Really , really, really, love this stuff!  I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon!  Sincerely, Dixie</li>
    <li> So I bought this product hoping to have a facial transformation. No seriously, I did.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 28, with very uneven skin tone and large pores. I have very oily skin. I bought the serum for the purposes of evening out my skin and balancing out the oil. I started using it every night initially. For the first 2 weeks my face broke out in areas that I don&#x27;t normally get acne. I contacted the company and they refunded me my money and encouraged me to keep using the product. So I bought the garnier charcoal blackhead eliminating scrub and started using it nightly before this serum. The results so far have been fantastic! My skin is starting to even out and my blackheads are starting to minimize in T zone. Now I&#x27;m considering buying it again as I&#x27;m almost thru with my bottle! Thank you insta natural!</li>
    <li> A wonderful product! I was very hesitant to use this on my acne-ridden skin, since it contains some oil, but it has worked very well without additional breakouts. Acne scars heal much quicker in the few weeks since I started using this product. After a decade of having substantial acne, this is helping to finally clear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprise benefit: the skin on my legs becomes very irritated in the summer heat, in conjunction with shaving, and using the serum after shaving reduces the bumps and blemishes.</li>
    <li> Not a miracle cream. My skin became severely dry (especially around my mouth/cheeks) when using it twice a day, so I&#x27;ve cut back to once a day. I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement in my skin after using it about two weeks.</li>
    <li> Wow. That&#x27;s all I can say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 36 y/o, and I&#x27;ve always had bouts of hormonal acne. I don&#x27;t know that the breakouts are necessarily getting worse, but my skin&#x27;s recovery time is getting longer. Blemishes that might have come and gone in a week in my 20&#x27;s are now hanging around for what seems like months. I&#x27;d decided to go to a dermatologist to get a Rx retinol to try to clear it up (or at least keep it under better control). Then, I read an article that suggested trying a nonRx retinol first because the Rx ones may work faster, but they&#x27;re also more likely to cause your skin to get really irritated. Plus, cost-wise, I was looking at a $40 copay + whatever the Rx copay would be, probably another $40 at the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo...after looking at a lot of product reviews, I decided on this product. At $20, I figured it was worth a try. And I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ve only used it 2 days now, and already my acne is almost GONE. I didn&#x27;t really buy it for the fine lines, etc., but I&#x27;m hopeful that it will do everything it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says it smells like oranges, but I disagree. It smells like citrus, but more like grapefruit than oranges. I&#x27;m only using it once a day for now to avoid irritation. I have very sensitive skin. There&#x27;s a small amount of burning (not too bad) right after I put it on, but it goes away quickly. I would highly suggest using moisturizer after applying it. I just put a little argan oil on.</li>
    <li> Bad. I broke out like crazy and have been trying to get my skin back to normal for months. I returned. It may work for others but not for all skin types especially sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was using Proactiv but my skin gets soooo dry in the winter it was tearing my face up. Got this and it feels amazing! Today is negative degree temps and face is still not chapped or irritated! Also haven&#x27;t had any breakouts yet with stopping the Proactiv.</li>
    <li> Was looking for Vitamin C serum and saw this product from Amazon. A bit skeptical but because of good reviews, I gave it a try, even bought 2 items with the Vit C from this brand&#x27;s line of products. Started trying it when I received the item, but I noticed of having breakouts after using. I just gave the 2 items that I bought to someone else though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever used (and I have used hundreds)!!  Will definitely reorder!! Love! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 and have struggled with acne, mostly hormonal, for years and years and years. Like many other women in my situation, I&#x27;ve tried everything. I&#x27;m mixed race -- black and white, and I think it&#x27;s important to share that because my skin scars after acne, even though I don&#x27;t pick at it. This stuff is a miracle. I used it for a month and after a week and a half I stopped getting breakouts entirely and my scars faded. My skin is softer, brighter, and healthier looking than it ever has been. So much so that I stopped wearing foundation altogether. I ran out and thought I could go without it and I noticed a difference after a week of not using it so I ordered another bottle. Absolutely worth the purchase and it&#x27;s not so expensive that you&#x27;ll regret it if for some reason it doesn&#x27;t work for you -- but I think it will. Just do it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skin. And more over i have observed that my pores get clogged. The vitamin c got oxidized very soon. It turned yellow in a week. I think that&#x27;s the case with every vitamin c serum. Would not suggest.</li>
    <li> Awesome! This is a wonderful product!  Have experienced the wonderful joy of adult acne but also want anti aging protection from my products so I am not dried out and scaly!  This works perfectly and has smoothed out my skin n texture very well! No more flare ups every month!</li>
    <li> works great, it took about a week for me to notice a change, feels tingly at first but got use to it...would recommend...didn&#x27;t take care of the deep wrinkles but noticed the  finer wrinkles disappearing</li>
    <li> I have a few small areas on my face with tiny, colorless bumps under the skin, which I think is keratosis pilaris.  This is the best skin serum I have tried.  I have been using it for 3 weeks now and my skin is already smoother.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum is a natural skin care ingredient that is often found in high-end beauty regimes. Antioxidant Vitamin C protects skin from free radicals and is essential in collagen production. Vitamin C is helpful for brightening and tightening skin</li>
    <li> Great product that helped reduce lines and lighten sun/age spot!  I wipe serum off dropper and then just tip bottle on index finger and apply.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I ordered one time before and serum was orange. This time I ordered the larger size as you tend to go through it fast and the serum was white....Label says same ingridents, but that was kind of weird. Anyway, love this product!!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but this product really lives up to its reputation. It smells great and absorbs fast. I apply it on my face daily after shower, especially in the area that I have acne scars. It has gradually improved my skin condition. I&#x27;m the type of person that has scars easily, and my scars usually take a long time to go away. This serum accelerates the healing process. I found it works best when you use it with moisturizer. Apply the serum first, and put moisturizer on.</li>
    <li> So far this is the only product I am able to tolerate without breaking out. I am grateful to have something to help the sunkisses and an over all age lifter... rejuvenator. Yes, I feel very good about this product. Slightly drying around my eyes, so I add a moisturizer or emu oil there.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Skin felt softer and appeared clearer with fewer breakouts shortly after initiating use. Make sure to shake bottle before using because ingredients may separate.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this serum in the evening.  It makes my skin feel extra refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I was previously using another retinol serum that I kind of liked, but this stuff I love. It makes my skin feel so soft and awesome and has helped a lot with evening out my skin tone. Absolutely amazing. I can feel it working a little bit when I apply, so someone with super sensitive skin may want to use caution. I am sooo happy to have purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: i was unable to get my hands on this for awhile and was completely devastated. It is my HG serum for sure.</li>
    <li> This product has quite a bit of oil in it.  I use it more of a spot treatment on my age and post pimple marks.  It&#x27;s just O.K.</li>
    <li> This product does not work for me been using it for 2 weeks now does not see any difference...</li>
    <li> luv it!! was skeptical at first but after reading the reviews thought I&#x27;d try it. I am soo happy I did!</li>
    <li> Do not listen to other 1000 five star reviews!!! My skin is very easy going, never sensitive with any facial products, plus i don&#x27;t allergic to anything. But this serum burns me like hell. This is REAL. My only third time and it already burns my skin so bad. I have no aches, no dark spot, no thing. The only reason I bought it because I want to try a new moisturizer. The old one I used leave me some dryness around the mouth area after morning. Sadly this product creates redness over my cheek, burn and painful. Other area like eye and forehead are find. Very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with the InstaNatural Glycolic Acid Cream 10%, and it&#x27;s been amazing! I have very oily, acne prone skin and these two products have been ASTOUNDING. I usually have really bad breakouts on my nose (I look like Rudolph the reindeer most days) and then breakouts around my cheeks. In just three days this cleared up all of the stubborn acne on my nose that refused to quit. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of brands from drugstore (Neutrogena, Simple, Olay) to high end(Clinique, Ole Henriksen, Korres) to all sorts of strange homeopathic remedies (many a night have my room mates seen me slathering all sorts of ingredients on my face in the hopes that I&#x27;ll find some sort of miracle cure for acne, ALAS) , and none of these things were able to clear up my nose. It seemed like I was always going through another tube of gunk that claimed to clear up stubborn breakouts (Neutrogena, I&#x27;m looking at you). After a fair bit of research, I skeptically read the glowing reviews for this serum and decided to take the plunge. Products that claim to do more than one thing always seem kind of sketchy to me, because in my experience most products can&#x27;t even do the single thing they claim to do. This one pretty much claims to clear up almost anything that can be wrong with your skin, and boy, I&#x27;m glad to say it doesn&#x27;t fall short on its promises. Just for clearing up my nose this stuff is a winner. It&#x27;s taken a bit more time to clear up the other areas, but they seem smaller and less red everyday. The rest of my skin that isn&#x27;t plagued by breakouts looks dewy and bright. I can&#x27;t really speak for the anti-aging properties of this miracle elixir (I&#x27;m 20), but if you have redness or acne of any kind, I really suggest this. I love the fact that most of the ingredients are natural, and I love that this has really brightened up my face and helped reduce the flood of oil that I seem to be constantly dealing with. I use three drops on my face every morning and night, and my guess is that the bottle will last almost three months if I keep using that much. The short term effects from this have been really wonderful, so I&#x27;m quite excited to see what the long term ones will be!</li>
    <li> I have picked up this product and put it down several times now. I have only ever had proactiv hurt my face like this did. Initially, I started using this product twice a day. My skin became very red and sensitive so I cut back to once a day, at night. Every time I would apply the product, it would sting like fire and became red, inflamed, and sore for several hours. I always hoped that it would go away....but it never did. Unfortunately, I can not use this product. I tried and tried and kept looking over the reviews seeing if the stinging I felt was &#x27;normal&#x27; but....alas...nothing. I am sad to say that I could not find anything miraculous about this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the serum. It contains all the ingredients Dr.s recommend in one serum instead of having to apply multiple products. It dries quickly and is not sticky. Love it and would recommend it! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Recently I&#x27;ve gotten more into using serums, I&#x27;ve tried a few and so far this serum is my favorite. It has a mild citrus smell not over powering and dissipates after a few seconds. At first I was doing my whole face but being an oily girl I found myself pretty greasy in the morning. I use this once in my night time routine before bed. Since in just waking up oily it&#x27;s not really a deal breaker, it is hydrating and makes the skin feel smooth.,..but the best part being a customer is the customer service. They check in with you on their product to make sure you&#x27;re totally satisfied, which I find is very helpful they&#x27;re there to answer any questions and fix any problems you may have. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have really bad acne on face since 2010 with time it getting worst. I have dark acne marks on my whole face.  I tried lots of different products nothing worked. I did research online and find abku this product.. This serum have lots of good reviews that&#x27;s y i wanna give a try.. I just ordered one..let&#x27;s. See what gonna happened next..I hope this product worth to buy...</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product. For the price, I thought it was worth trying. So far, so good. I love the smell and how my skin feels.</li>
    <li> Great price......awesome quality! Just ordered my second bottle. This will not just be another one of those beauty products that collects dust. You will use every drop!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I really like the InstaNatural product line. Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my face feel!&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a very expensive product similar to this from YSL and this is every bit as good and less than half the price.  So happy I found this serum and looking better to boot!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is really pleasant and it absorbs into your skin quickly so you can move forward with putting your foundation on right away.  I am very impressed with the quality of this product for the price.  It leaves your face and declotte moisturized and dewy without feeling oily at all.  I use it in the am and in the pm and I have found my skin to be satiny smooth and supple.  I am really happy I found this product, I am 47 and most people guess I am in my 30&#x27;s so I want to keep it this way with this Vitamin C serum.  I highly recommend this product and will tell my friends about it as well!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for three weeks. I apply it in the morning and again at bedtime. The fine lines around my mouth and eyes are improving and I have not had any skin irritation. My much younger sister now wants some!  My age? 67 years young!!</li>
    <li> This thing is a miracle</li>
    <li> Love the product. Actually can see big results in 1 week of using the product...  would highly recommend...</li>
    <li> I suffer with skin that thinks it&#x27;s a teenager. An aging teenager with visible pores (or is that 30? That&#x27;s just 30 isn&#x27;t it).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month to two months now, and I see a great improvement over my:&lt;br /&gt; acne - less than before, and breakouts are quicker to disappear;&lt;br /&gt;my flaky skin - above eyebrows I have the worst flakiness, this stuff really seems to keep it in check;&lt;br /&gt;pores - I have larger pores at the side of my nose and below my eyes, I have definitely noticed my pores are clearer and are slightly smaller in appearance. I use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;During lady times --- you know how your skin basically says &amp;#34;screw you face&amp;#34;. yeah? well, this feels like you are winning a battle. It doesn&#x27;t cure my PMS breakouts, but it really helps keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a cosmetic maker and am really up on my ingredients. The ingredients are really nice! As natural as you can get! I like that.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product because it has a lot of good reviews and I want to clear my acne All though the third night I used it I noticed I was getting little bumps but they were so tiny. I am sad this product didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product to treat a few acne breakouts and it seems to clear up within 24 hours of use. I do like it and the fact that it makes the skin dewy and glowy...for me however the glow turns greasy after some time.  It may be due the fact that my skin has been over compensating sebum for the past few days due to self inflicted dry skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have noticed the clearing up of my skin, acne scarring has diminished and I havent had any new acne breakout episodes. My skin has been keeping clear for the most part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have an updated detailed review on my blog soon. I was sent this product to try out and review. Check my blog and subscribe via email to see that review when I post it.</li>
    <li> I love to use this under my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Okay this product....FREAKIN AWESOME. It has smoothed and cleared my skin! No hesitation, ADD TO CART now!!! I am in love with this serum. In fact, let me go order some more right now!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum! This really helps with my occasional blemish. I apply this before bed and notice a difference by morning.</li>
    <li> So excited to try this. I got it the other day. I first used the dead sea mud and put this on afterwards. Its Amazing. I love the smell. Its a little sticky at first but goes on nicely and makes my face feel smooth and fresh.  I will be buying this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> omg! In spite of reading some of the bad reviews, I figured after all a product with so many positive comments, has to work. Well it did, in the worst  possible way! I have painful acne on one side of my face, which was pretty clear.i do have oily skin and have the occasional pimple every now and the, but this made it worse! And they are painful ones too! I am inclined to agree with others who have suffered like me and am so baffled that it got so many positive reviews, I really want a refund. not sure what&#x27;s happening with this product since i have used retinol before and never had this kind of reaction.</li>
    <li> It does nothing get rid of acne or acne scars. It smells like citrus stuff. It feels sticky on your face like sweat you haven&#x27;t washed off your face. I think it&#x27;s done worse to my skin because it clogs my pores. It&#x27;s way too pricey for a product that doesn&#x27;t do anything. Don&#x27;t be tricked by the long title and it&#x27;s claims for reducing skin problems. Don&#x27;t trust that it&#x27;s a bestseller either. It really does nothing. I feel like I wasted my money once again.</li>
    <li> I think this serum helped the overall &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of my skin, I don&#x27;t think it helped eliminate any acne I was suffering with. I would say that although this did not irritate or make my skin any worse, I was disappointed to find new bumps appear in the mornings. On occasion, it would help with redness but I am pretty disappointed considering this product has received such excellent reviews.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  I am desperately trying to fade some hyperpigmentation on my face but to no avail they still are present  after using a entire bottle of  this product. Maybe others will have better success with this product.</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast. I&#x27;ve only been using product for a few days but my skin feels better already. Also has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> The product is fine and I like it.  But the bottling of the product is defective.  I had to travel twice, and each time I made sure that the bottle was well close.  Somehow each time the bottle top gets loose and the liquid spill out.  After my second trip and second leak, I had no more product.  You should do a better bottle that does not leak.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m very picky with facial products cus i have a very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it along with another instanatural product called hyaluronic acid serum and my moisturizer for more than 2 weeks now and I do see a big change my skin is softer and the pores are smaller, no irritation (thank goodness) I&#x27;m very happy cus my skin agrees.. so I will continue to use them for years to come</li>
    <li> nice product for my face and it smells great</li>
    <li> I really love this product I get compliments on my skin now and before I used it I did not....must be because of the vitamin C serum 😀</li>
    <li> I have to say I NEVER EVER write reviews , but I&#x27;m so happy with this Serum that I must share my opinion :)&lt;br /&gt;Im 38 and probably after turning 34-35  I felt like my youth peachy glow kind of disappear. ..this product brought back a beautiful healthy looking glow and also clear my skin as well of here and there adult acne. I simply love it and I definitely ordering another one .&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU :)</li>
    <li> Cleared my skin up and my redness disappeared :)</li>
    <li> So as soon as i used it i did notice a burning sensation and i thought it was the cleanser i was using turns out it was this since i returned the cleanser and still had burning. I use it with a good moisturizer so the redness that did appear before doesn&#x27;t but without a moisturizer it gets red and puffy. Almost instantly i got black heads i thought nothing of it as since a lot of these things have to get worse before thr y get better but at this point its ridiculous and i dont think ill be recommending to anyone.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am pleased with InstaNatural&#x27;s Age-Defying &amp; Skin Clearing Serum. I began using a&lt;br /&gt;comparable retinol serum recently but I was almost finished with the bottle and it was&lt;br /&gt;out of stock. I decided to try InstaNatural&#x27;s version because I liked the other&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural products that I had tried.  I have oily, acne-prone skin. I have dealt with&lt;br /&gt;acne for almost 30 years. I was using a prescription topical medication with a retinoid&lt;br /&gt;that is no longer covered by my insurance. It is expensive to buy on its own. Therefore I&lt;br /&gt;needed to revamp my skin care routine to stay blemish free without it. I purchased a sonic face&lt;br /&gt;brush to help with exfoliation. Currently I use a cleanser, two serums, a product with benozoyl&lt;br /&gt;peroxide and then a moisturizer each evening (all products but the one with benzoyl peroxide are InstaNatural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need skin care products that will not cause blemishes. I also prefer those that are vegan and do not animal test because I have&lt;br /&gt;been a vegetarian for 22 years. I use InstaNatural&#x27;s Age-Defying &amp; Skin Clearing Serum&lt;br /&gt;once a day in the pm. It has a pleasant scent and I appreciate that it dispenses with a dropper. I began using it about 3 weeks ago. In conjunction&lt;br /&gt;with the Skin Brightening Serum which I use twice a day, it gives my skin a nice glow. I would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
    <li> .. this serum is my one of my favorite.. it makes my skin soft and its very light..its worth it...</li>
    <li> good product makes my face feel great</li>
    <li> I have already seen a difference in my skin since starting to sue InstaNatural.  My skin is smoother and the dark marks are fading.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  This product turned me on to try other ones made by this company.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  I did see a reduction in fine lines around my eyes and my skin cleared up slightly.  Nice scent and absorbs easily.  Overall I really like it &amp; I reordered more!</li>
    <li> I naturally have oily skin so i love the fact that it reduces d amount of oil on my face throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is not for me..Tried it for two weeks it broke me out and left my skin very itchy</li>
    <li> Pretty good twice a week product!</li>
    <li> Only time will tell.  I&#x27;ll follow up in a month or so.  I do like the consistency and it has a nice citrus smell.</li>
    <li> Smells terrific. Still too early to see results but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
    <li> Love this serum!  The best I&#x27;ve tried - all fantastic ingredients and my skin is getting better every day!</li>
    <li> This feels really nice on and has a pleasant smell. It sinks right into the skin. Can&#x27;t say how well it clears yet as I have only been using it a couple days.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this serum in combination with the Glytone Back Acne Spray, and Acne Pills with Pantothenic Acid and Vitamin B5 - Le Fair Complexion Formula. It has done WONDERS for his back acne. I cannot recommend this combo highly enough! He has dealt with back acne for years and has gone through several rounds of harsh antibiotics from the dermatologist, which made him sick. This combo keeps him feeling healthy, and has cleared up this relentless skin condition better than it has looked in over a decade! Thank you so much for this product. Will be buying this forever.</li>
    <li> Gives my skin a nice, natural glow.  Too soon to tell if it is helping with my acne.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff. Will re-order.</li>
    <li> The product smells great, I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference but I think this is a worth while product.</li>
    <li> great product. Will buy more! I can definitely see my skin clearing up. My skin tone is better.</li>
    <li> This is very nice serum. It is my favorite added to emu oil &amp; vitamin e oil at night. Very nice fed skin in the morning. The ingredients are based on outstanding current research. I&#x27;ve learned feed your skin well in the morning &amp; upon going to sleep brings wonderful results.</li>
    <li> This is the first product that I have found that actually works on my adult acne. I am loving it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple of weeks so I&#x27;m not exactly sure of how well it will end up working for me, but so far I&#x27;m seeing some results. I noticed some lightening of sun spots on my nose and some old acne scars. I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles yet, but I feel like the skin on my neck feels much firmer. I like the texture of this serum compared to another one I was using prior. It&#x27;s creamy and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, plus I really like the citrus smell. The smell goes away once it soaks in, so you won&#x27;t smell like an orange all day. There is a very slight burn on any existing blemishes, but goes away quickly. It hasn&#x27;t caused any redness, but I did break out around my mouth. It&#x27;s clearing up quickly, so I&#x27;m hoping it was either because of my hormones or it&#x27;s just purging itself. I&#x27;ll know better in the next month or so. I&#x27;ve read online that it can take up to 8-10 weeks to see the best results. I plan to keep on using this product.</li>
    <li> It does seem to slightly heal dark acne spots after but is drying to the skin. You will need a good moisturizer cream. Does not seem to prevent any acne but minimize existing acne.</li>
    <li> My skin tone has a more even look now.  I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and I was hoping that it would help shrink my pores better.  Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> best purchase. works great to eliminate dark spots &amp; acne scarring. does not clog pores and clears acne while moisturizing. love the citrus smell. A+</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using this product I am on my second bottle and my skin has become much more clear, to the point where I am no longer using a myriad of acne products and just using this, moisturizer and a mild cleanser, everyone&#x27;s skin is different but if you&#x27;re struggling its worth the $20 bucks....</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell it did anything.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I will reorder when I complete the bottle.  My skin is clearer and firmer from using this serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two months now. I am using the Insta-Natural Age Defying Skin Clearing Serum in the morning. I am using it in combination with Claror Acne Treatment S1 (which I am using at night) and spot treatments with Bye Bye Blemish or tea tree oil, plus the occasional Moroccan red clay powder mask. Since I started using everything I&#x27;ve listed at about the same time, it&#x27;s impossible to say what&#x27;s helping the most. However, I just really wanted to get my skin cleared up quickly for an event about a month ago and so I just started to buy stuff that seemed like it would help and using it all, hoping that something would work. So far, I have been pleased. I seem to have some  dry patches of skin if I overdo the spot treatments but even that is managed by moisturizing or spot treating less frequently. Otherwise no problems for me! I do still get blemishes but my skin is looking much better than it was. Plus the serum smells awesome! It has a clean, fresh citrus scent. I have some before and after photos to show how much you skin has improved, not great photos but they do make the point.</li>
    <li> This product works very well in clearing up acne issues.</li>
    <li> I REALLY like this product!  I only use a drop for my neck, a drop for my each side of chin and lower face, and a drop for my forehead, so this small bottle goes a L-O-N-G way. It glides on smoothly for complete coverage; leaves my skin feeling VERY soft and silky.  I don&#x27;t detect any obnoxious odor associated with the product---only a VERY light citrusy scent that dissipates quickly once applied.  Comes in a glass bottle with a glass dropper, so there are no worries about plastic leaching into the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first item on my face, followed by a face moisturizer with SPF30 (Naked Bee). Even after the first use i DID see a reduction in the tiny lines around my chin, less laugh lines, and less wrinkling in my forehead!  Have used it for several weeks now and I am EXTREMELY satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11-21-15 Ordered my 2nd bottle!  I didn&#x27;t take the serum on vacation; after 2 weeks of non-use, I could tell that the &amp;#34;fine lines&amp;#34; were creeping back.  I&#x27;ve got to figure out a way to take a small amount (in a plastic container) with me on the next vacation!  Love this serum!!</li>
    <li> This product has a great smell.  It is a nice creamy texture.  It seems so far to be working amazing.  I use it every day.  No issues with drying out my skin.  My skin looks really smooth, glowing and healthy.  I have used a lot of Vitamin C serums.  I would definitely give this brand a try.  They are very diligent about emailing out information facts about their product which is nice as some companies dont even want to tell you what is in their products.  I would use this as the price is right and the product is QUALITY!</li>
    <li> yes I like the product. thank you</li>
    <li> Wow! I was skeptical at first, but after just a week of using this stuff, I must say that I am thoroughly impressed! I have had splotchy, dull skin due to illness and acne and have tried so many different products to try and revive my skin, to no avail.  I used it the first night after it arrived and I woke up the next morning with brighter, smoother skin. Over the past week, my wrinkles have smoothed out and my scars are less noticeable. I can&#x27;t believe it. For the first time in years I wake up in the morning looking refreshed instead of tired and old. I have dry skin so I use this under my regular moisturizer and it stings just a bit after I apply the moisture, but I don&#x27;t mind at all. I will be purchasing this product again. Also, it smells fabulous! Like fresh tangerines... Mmmm...</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product! It helped clear my acne and my mom also used it and it help even her skin tone. It also smells so amazing !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now, and I&#x27;m not sure how to feel about it. I was super excited to get it, after reading all the positive reviews and the ingredient list looked amazing.  I have food allergies and a host of other things that means my skin is less than ideal as I work to detox etc...so I&#x27;ve had some acne for awhile now ..but it has never been painful, cystic, bleeding acne!!!! After I started using this I developed large pimples that hurt to touch and some have actually bled!!! I&#x27;ve tried a myraid of skin care products over the years and never experienced this.  At the same time however, my skin does look for radiant and has a sort of glow to it and I think some fine wrinkles have lessened...but..is it worth it? I still have to cover my face in concealer because of the zits ..so it is a catch-22.  I will give it two more weeks and see if anything changes..hopefully it is helping my skin to purge out toxins and this acne will go away!  If not, I&#x27;m never touching this stuff again!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first but this cleared up a problem spot on my face within a month.  Skin was noticeably better after only two applications.  The major spot had been a problem for thirty years and had been resistant to all manner of treatments (including freezing) during those years.  Improved in the first week and by the end of a month was completely gone.  For that alone it is worth its weight in gold.  Even my physician was amazed.  Cannot recommend more highly!!!</li>
    <li> product works to exfoliate-not angel dusted, but active amounts of product-my skin looks clearer and brighter. Have been getting good compliments-combine it with homemade Tend-.dark spots,lightening and skin smoother A little expensive, but you only need a little</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne and have tried everything.  I was looking for a clear up serum and a bit of moisturizer for my eyes and wrinkles.  I was sucked in by the great reviews.  Sadly, it has brought back those &amp;#34;little white bumps&amp;#34; &amp;#60;---- not sure what to call them or what they really are (def not zits).  They re-appeared under my eyes and several on different areas of my face.  I recently just got rid of them, so it&#x27;s a huge disappointment.  On another note, It smells great and absorbs really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, my search continues ...</li>
    <li> Love this product! I bought this hoping to get rid of the acne and acne scars on my chin. At first, I used it for about a week and didn&#x27;t really see any results. The serum made my cheeks kind of dry, so I stopped using it for a while. Then I started using it again just on the t-zone twice a day. About a couple of weeks, I really noticed that I stopped breaking out on my chin. You need to be patient and use it consistently to see results. I still have acne scars, the product didn&#x27;t make them fade as fast as I wanted, but overall, I think this product really works.</li>
    <li> have noticed positive results after using it for months.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice citrus smell and very non-greasy feeling.  I have been testing this product for my skin sensitivities, but my skin really likes the product.  I have not tried many retinal products, but I have started because my hand have been in such rough shape this year.</li>
    <li> I love that this was great for wrinkles and acne! it really has helped me out with both those problems. love the brand instanatural seriously one of the best brands out there</li>
    <li> This actually works, and it&#x27;s not expensive, either.</li>
    <li> Made my whole face break out in a red bumpy rash</li>
    <li> This is the best solution I have found to get rid of my breakouts on face.. It worked like a charm.. Thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing to see that you buy a product after reading so many positive reviews and the product does nothing. I have been using this serum for a month now and don&#x27;t see any dramatic changes. Please don&#x27;t write reviews with the actual experience. This is a bad product!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; have been using this about 2 wks, no problems. It hasn&#x27;t cleared up my rosacea like redness but will continue &amp; see how it goes. Smells nice &amp; absorbs great. Not greasy &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if maybe my product has gone bad, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, I have never have allergies to any cream so I am terribly surprise that every time I use this it feels like burning on the skin around my eyes right on my cheekbones, and it leaves it very sensitive. I don&#x27;t understand as this product has great ingredients. I am very excited about trying this but I guess I should discontinue the use of it, but I have only tried for 3 days! :(</li>
    <li> I am middle aged and sometimes get adult acne.  I have a few marks left over from these breakouts.  This product has evened my skin tone out immensely.  It&#x27;s not oily and I can put it around my sensitive eyes with no problem.My skin feels great and I get compliments from people who think I&#x27;m younger than my 56 years.  I love this stuff and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of the Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum. It&#x27;s now my all-in-one beauty regiment. It has the Hyaluronic Acid (anti-aging), Retinol (anti-aging), Vitamin C (tone smoothing) PLUS Salicylic Acid (acne fighting) and Niacinamide (acne redness reduction). It&#x27;s rare to find the acne component in other skincare solutions. At 42, I still need all of these items, and purchased separately, can be costly for high-quality products. My laugh lines around my eyes are less noticeable, my skin discolorations from healed pimples, etc. have faded completely, the frown line in between my brows is less noticeable, and it smells great and absorbs quickly without drying out my skin. I&#x27;ll continue to use twice daily under my make-up and before bed. Since you should follow with a moisturizer after applying the serums, I&#x27;m going to try the Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream (day) and the Night Cream Moisturizer (night). Using in combination with the Eye Serum provides everything I need to keep my skin looking fresh and healthy!</li>
    <li> lovely product,nice smell .i will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I tried this InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum and so far so good! I have noticed the improvements in just few days of using it. Thighness of my skin but soft and feel smooth. I received this product free in exchange for the product testing and an honest and unbiased review. BUT I am not obligated to provide a positive feedback or 5 Stars. I always rely on customer reviews when I try or want to buy a product online so I do understand the importance of reviewing a product and I always talk about based on my experience. I have also bought some products in full price and reviewed them. I hope my opinion helps.</li>
    <li> Pleasing smell, easy to apply and I can notice a difference, although I am not finished with t first bottle.</li>
    <li> This product has a subtle orange smell that I find pleasant. It definitely moisturizes my faces after I finish dermarolling it, and I don&#x27;t break out which serums usually do because I have combination skin. However I bought this serum to see a notable improvement in my skin; I want the dark pigmentation spots to fade and my skin to look refreshed. I haven&#x27;t noticed any of that which is why I&#x27;m only giving it four stars.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this serum twice! Great product and texture for day and night!</li>
    <li> Product as described. Works well, has a nice citrous scent/flavor and does make your skin feel smooth. Cleansed my skin of a few blemishes. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> I have acne and acne scars and after 2 weeks of using this I&#x27;m seeing a huge difference. I like the dropper bottle so I can control how much I put on my face at a time. I&#x27;ve been applying morning and night and like the results I&#x27;m seeing. A co-worker asked today what I was using on my skin because she thought it looked radiant.</li>
    <li> This serum seems to be slowly working on some dark spots on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for only two weeks so time will tell.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice ay difference</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  I use it only once a day because I have very sensitive skin.  I did see improvement with blemishes.  I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer because I don&#x27;t need it.  I have extremely oily skin and a moisturizer adds extra oil which I don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> Awesome results in 3 weeks. Mild peeling leading to flawless skin!!</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin, is brighter, clearer, more even toned and younger looking. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I am 50 years old and pre menopausal.  For a couple of months I&#x27;ve have had a lot of chin acne, some cystic.  I&#x27;ve always suffered on and off through my adult years with this but it&#x27;s been a little worse lately.  I tried this product based on the reviews and that I&#x27;m trying to find more natural products to use on my face.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days and have seen a drastic difference.  It&#x27;s cleared up the remnants of ones that were in the process of healing and has shrunk the news ones attempting to come out.  I know it&#x27;s only been 3 days but anything that shows results that quickly is a winner in my book.  Thank you Insta Natural.</li>
    <li> so far after 3 weeks, the product is doing what it said!</li>
    <li> This made me break out and my skin is not overly sensitive.</li>
    <li> This also, is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and I love it.  My skin is clear and smooth</li>
    <li> Having gotten this from I love to review I was glad I hadn&#x27;t paid full price for it.. Although I was only able to use it once and broke out in a rash. ( I have very sensitive skin) My neighbor was very impressed with this serum and said she would buy it again.  It left her face feeling soft and refreshed and it got rid of the few Pimples that she had before she used it.&lt;br /&gt;So in the long run I would give it a good overall rating and recommend it to anyone that doesn&#x27;t have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is age defying. I look pretty young to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did not clear up my acne problem, but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to. Overall, I think it probably does help.</li>
    <li> Truly the best thing for your skin is this serum!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks or so now and it is amazing!  It has cleared brown spots i had, it has cleared my skin to where i feel no bumps on my skin. Just smooth soft skin.  And best of all... it has plumped up my face!  No lie!  I wake up with NO lines at all and it stays that way and my skin seems younger, more elastic, more plump.  Acts like it did when i was in my late 20s.  With continued use I&#x27;m hoping it will firm my skin as well.  It actually has already done that somewhat.  Truly, i will not buy another serum but this ever!  It has every ingredient that you skin needs.  Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Retinold, Hylauronic Acid.  These 4 ingredients together in one serum makes for savings in not having to buy them separately.  Genius serum and i truly hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  Always happens to me when i like something, it gets discontiued.  LOL  Overall, i&#x27;d say GET THIS SERUM ASAP and use it religiously!  You&#x27;ll thank me!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Products I have ever used! I have combination skin and have struggled with acne for the past four years and after adding this product to my skin care routine I was Amazed with the results!!!!! My acne cleared up by 50% in just a few days and was almost completely gone after two weeks using this product. It smells great too!!!! Will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this Age Defying- Skin Clearing serum! It&#x27;s so smooth and goes on light, but packs a punch!  The InstaNatural brand is quickly becoming my favorite beauty brand!  They use only the highest quality ingredients, and in this particular product: a plethora of organic ingredients; salicylic acid, niacinamide, retinol, and vitamin c to name a few of the big hitters.&lt;br /&gt;A big dose of antioxidants is always a good idea, especially with summer quickly approaching--which will help combat the effect of sun exposure and UV rays.  The complex in this serum will work together to reverse the signs of aging; wrinkles, age spots and discoloration, hyper pigmentation, as well as blemishes and irritated skin.  This is a miracle in a bottle! :)</li>
    <li> I received this a little over a week ago as a promotional item for review and started using it immediately. The first time I put it on my face there was some slight burning to my face, but it went away soon after. Now I use it every night after washing my face and I have not had any burning since the first application. In the morning, I put coconut oil on my face after washing. I have noticed that my skin breakouts have improved in the last week and my skin feels softer. I will continue to use this product, along with the coconut oil, to help with my skin breakouts and fine wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My skin looks more vibrant and my skin-tone is more even. I definitely think I have seen an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Wow this product is GOLD! My skin was neither good, nor terribly bad. I did have a lot of tiny blackheads on my nose, and an occasional pimple, and the texture of my skin was not very smooth. I used this every night after cleansing my face and let it sink it, then followed it with a moisturizer. It only took about one week to see results and I am so happy. I&#x27;m only 20, so I can&#x27;t speak about wrinkles, but the overall texture of my skin is better. It has faded the dark spots from past pimples, some of which I had for awhile that would NOT go away. The black heads on my nose are not fully gone, but they have reduced by at least 60%. My skin is softer, smoother, and blemish free. I recommend this product to anyone, whether you have aging skin or acne prone skin, dry or oily skin. Doesn&#x27;t matter. Just make sure to always follow up with a moisturizer, as it is drying. I used organic Black Castor Oil to moisturize and it works perfect with the serum. I&#x27;m already repurchasing my next bottle so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly three weeks now and can definitely see a difference in the appearance of skin. The overall tone is brighter, fresher looking. I will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I have noticed an improvement in my skin. It is softer, smoother and just looks better. I use this at night and the   Hyaluronic Acid Serum -2 FL OZ- BEST VEGAN... in the morning. The two together have made a distinct improvement in my skin. These are keepers!!</li>
    <li> Nice I like it, it&#x27;s irritate a little bit when I apply on dry skin, but other than that I will recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Don&#x27;t see a drastic change on my skin texture but it I feel good after  applying it.</li>
    <li> As usual instanatural hit a home run with this product. I use this at least once a day, in conjunction with their retinal serum. My skin is in perfect condition with the use of these products.</li>
    <li> Saw no change in my skin after using for a few weeks. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Horrible product, made me break out everywhere I used it on. I continued using, hoping it would get better. Now my skin is dry and ripping off.</li>
    <li> Been using vitamin c for about 18 Month, love what I see a lot. First time trying  c serum with retinal, I thought it might be a little dry for my skin.  But surprise surprise, it was not drying at all. after 2 week of usage, My skin feels smoother than using the Vitamin c serum long.  For te price and the natural ingredient,this is a must have . Great value and result.  I received ths with a discount, but my opinion is honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> This serum is working really well for me.  It is making my skin feel and look much smoother.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!! Does what it says. Perfect for combination skin &amp; large pores</li>
    <li> I apply this stuff at night and I&#x27;m starting to tell a slight difference in my very fine lines. I believe you must use their lotion to get the best results. I have no complaints so far about any of their skin care products!</li>
    <li> This is the best vit c serum clears acne too</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! It does everything you would want a serum to do. I have to say InstaNatural products are quite amazing I have not been disappointed with anything I have ordered so far.  Their products do exactly what they say they will do and thats a big plus because a lot of products out there...... especially department store products do not own up to their claims!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice serum, not watery goes on nicely and smells fabulous! This is definitely part of my daily face routine and I will continue to use this serum!</li>
    <li> Great product has decrease my dark spots on face and also minimized lines a bit.</li>
    <li> Bought it 3 times. First time I loved it&#x27;s potency so much that I bought additional two. I kept one in the refrigerator because it was too hot outside and I was afraid it might lose potency while not in use like my last serum. Normally the serum&#x27;s consistency is milky and it soaks into my skin without feeling greasy. My skin experienced minor peeling the first time, and my skin looked bright the next morning. However keeping the 3rd one in the refrigerator was a BIG mistake. The consistency became transparent and the serum seemed to have lost it&#x27;s potency. I no longer experienced peeling or my skin didn&#x27;t feel fresh or rejuvenated as before. I would highly recommend this serum, but be aware of the temperature. A bit hot or cold might make it lose it&#x27;s potency.</li>
    <li> Have not ordered yet, used oz serum, trying to settle with one permanent. Sounds great with the testimonials</li>
    <li> This serum is a MIRACLE!!! I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of some very dark and large dark spots on my skin caused by the sun and I tried the most expensive products on the market with no success at all. On the very second day of using this serum, I&#x27;d say my spots have lightened up about 35%. My skin feel tight and definitely younger. It has worked for me and I will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product my skin hasnt been any better when i use this serum clears up my sensitive acne prone skin .. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> “Love this product it does what it said will do. leave my skin beautiful.”</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the number of reviews for this product.  There are reviews practically everyday, and any product like this takes time before you experience results.  I use many of the serums, and this one is no better.  I am skeptical of the hefty submission of reviews.  That, in itself would keep me from ordering again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! It is amazing! I was on a prescription of tazmorac cream to help with my cystic acne and now I don&#x27;t have to use it anymore. I have not only noticed my skin is clear but fine lines and age spots are less noticeable. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work like I expected. There are as many pimples on my forehead as before I started using this product. A disappointment considering the price of the bottle was $20+.However, customer service was top notch!!!! Best communication!!!</li>
    <li> I read the positive reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a couple of weeks now and I must say I am pleasantly surprised. My acne looks much better and my skin looks refreshed and plumper. In addition, the older acne spots have lightened. If you&#x27;re considering buying this, I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> So far I think this is great. I see a difference in the big wrinkle between my eyes.  I will be getting more.</li>
    <li> I love this product! After the first use I saw a difference in my skin. My pores were reduced and it helped even out my skin tone. Also, I have very few blackheads now. My skin looks youthful and bright! First time in a long time that I am comfortable going out without wearing foundation or powder. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a month, but so far, I love it! This product is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling smooth immediately after application. I am definitely purchasing another bottle so that I can continue to see where this product takes my skin!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews. I gave it a little time (almost 2 months) just to see if I&#x27;d see a difference and I&#x27;m disappointed to say that nothing on my face has changed. I expected my spots to be reduced, but they are still as bright and visible as they were before using this product. Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;An hour before I left this review, someone named AJ who claimed to be the founder of Instanatural had sent me an email. I had not noticed the email until after leaving this review. In the email he asked me how I liked the product and he also said that if the product did not work out for me simply respond to the email and they would work something out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I responded to the email with the review I left below they apologized for my experience and said they would give me a full refund for what I paid on Amazon. This was an hour or so ago so I hope they do follow through on that. They said that I could keep the product. I am really pleased at their service and although this product did not work for me I am happy that they do refund you if the product is not to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Original review ----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product as recommended for a few weeks now and my facial skin has gotten worse. I&#x27;m 28 years old and have oily skin and before I never had acne on the left side of my face. Thanks to this product I have acne on both sides of my face. It seems like the product hasn&#x27;t helped my skin at all and has caused me to break out more. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results. My face is going through strange stages due to health issues but I do believe it to be good.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be everything the manufacturer promised. Great for aging problem skin. I only use it at night as it&#x27;s a bit thick.</li>
    <li> After 8 weeks of using this 1-2 times a day, I have not had to use cover up or been blessed with a blemish. I will buy this again and again and again and again.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;ve tried everything under the moon. I also have pretty sensitive skin for as long as I&#x27;ve known. Not only did I not get a bad reaction but I think the stuff actually works. Honestly it&#x27;s hard for me to gauge because I see myself every day... kind of like weight loss. Others notice more than you do yourself. Anyway, the reason I believe this actually works is because 1. the compliments I&#x27;ve received 2. I think I really am starting to notice and 3. You know that silly face recognition website just recently created  by Microsoft? Anyway, I tested it with a bunch of group photos of myself and other gals and I&#x27;m 10+ years older than all of the ladies most of the time and in the app I end up being either the same age or younger than all of the ladies! Okay so it&#x27;s not completely accurate but I still think it&#x27;s pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I think it&#x27;s also a great product. I&#x27;ve tried so many expensive products and really happy to have found something that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and leg to do what I want it to do. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;ll be awhile before I need another bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is more than I expected!  The white bumps under my eyes are gone and the lines are diminishing. My skin is looking better and better every day.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, even though this smelled fabulous it created a reaction in my skin which broke out in a rash after I used it. I guess this product just isn&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;This product worked well to hydrate parched skin and even my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt more smooth and supple&lt;br /&gt;Good exfolixating and healing properties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;It only mildly healed skin impurities such as scarring and acne (was hoping for better results comparable to the before/after pictures in other reviews)&lt;br /&gt;The lid on my product did not stay shut well and upon tipping over one night, half of the contents were leaked (may have been a simple defect)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would 100% recommend this product for someone wanting a more even skintone. I think it would work particularly well for someone with combination skin to exfoliate oil and blemishes and hydrate dry to normal skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks. I wanted to try this because as a woman in my 40&#x27;s I&#x27;ve developed skin with less elasticity and also began having breakouts of cystic acne. While I haven&#x27;t yet noticed firmer skin, I haven&#x27;t had any acne breakouts of any kind since I began using this product. It smells amazing and feels fantastic when applying plus the customer service of this company is second to none. I plan on trying all products they offer.</li>
    <li> I think this impact on my skin is fundamental and very impressive. I reduce my pore size a lot and brighten much more than before. I tried it 3 weeks and the result is dramatic. Try this one you cannot regret about your choice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m too old to believe in miracles, but this product has performed a little magic.</li>
    <li> Great product, my complexion has dramatically improved as well as my acne.  I still have minor breakouts but they are not as bad as they use to be.This is a must have for skin care products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and have seen noticeable results.  My face, while not plagued with acne, does appear more even toned and I have not experienced any hormonal acne which is not uncommon to happen. Vitamin C is a key necessity for a good skin care regime and I like that this product includes retinol for my mature skin (I&#x27;m 46).  The consistency is not watery and absorbs quickly. This product is a good value.</li>
    <li> Great product..I have not had one complaint about there serums my skin is brighter and dark spots are fading!</li>
    <li> Great product, my skin is glowing!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on scars/blemishes/ and stretch marks. So far it has worked great and has a nice light orange-y smell to it. I use it on my face and belly. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. Light, liquidy, and dries clear without residue. The lid is actually a dropper so it is easy to use, just use a few drops in your hand and rub it in. A little goes a long way. I feel like I have seen some stubble changes in the health of my skin already and I have only been using for a couple weeks! I also have used this after using a microderm roller and it really works great sinking into my pores! Most days however, I just wash my face, put a couple drops of this on and then apply makeup. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to improve the look and feel of their skin/scars/blemishes, etc.!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference to my skin almost immediately. Redness and freckles evened out and my skin seemed to glow.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My skin cleared up and felt incredibly balanced - even through different climate/weather changes as I traveled. On my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I love it! It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and that&#x27;s big for me, my skin looks and feel great. Thank you for this product</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! I have under skin whiteheads on my chin and have tried many  products on the market to clear them up. Most were just a waste of money, or dried my skin horribly. I&#x27;ve been using the Skin Clearing Serum for 3 weeks and my skin is completely clear and so soft and smooth. Also using the Insta Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Both amazing products for clearing, smoothing and softening the face.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne, mostly breaking out around my menstrual cycle.  Within the first two days of using this product I had a horrible breakout on my cheeks.  I will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is youth in a bottle. I have shared this with everyone i know / who will listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a bunch of serums and this one is by far my favorite because you don&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer on top of it during the summertime. The consistency is amazing and your skin soaks it right now. You will see a difference within days of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
    <li> Have been using this serum for about 10 days now and am very happy with it.  It is much too soon to see any great changes in my skin, but I must say that this serum seems to calm down anything that appears on my skin, as well as an overall clearer and even coloring.  I have already ordered my second bottle so that I don&#x27;t run out.  Also, I repeat myself by saying that I believe this seller to be one of the very best!!  All in all, I am quite happy with this product and plan to continue using it as a big part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> As an esthetician, I can back up that this serum is AWESOME. I am an Aveda Institute graduate and this product line blows Aveda&#x27;s out of the water. It&#x27;s a great price and it is jam-packed with really great ingredients. It helps clear up acne, even out skin tone and reduce wrinkles (of of which I was hoping to accomplish by using this product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their other products are great too. I&#x27;ve gone on a InstaNatural craze and bought 3 more of their products last week off their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Make it short, this product is really helpful to treat acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this serum is mainly used to anti winkle or refresh skin, I found it really useful to remove acne and improve skin condition. I had terrible acne for three years and tried various product such as kiehl&#x27;s and PCA skin care. However, these product can only kill the existing acne but your face is still oily or overdry which means the acne will still breakout again. But this vitamin c serum not only remove my acne but also balance my face environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy it 10 days ago and now my face is 90% recovered. I can feel that my pore is cleared.&lt;br /&gt;Also, remember to take moisture after using this product! So the serum can be better absorded. And moisture would prevent the over dry of the face due to the vitamin C?</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product! Will be getting again and again!!</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference after using the product over a month</li>
    <li> I have very problematic skin. Gets oily, prone to redness and acne, and has scarring/discoloration from previous acne breakouts. Haven&#x27;t been using this for a long period but it definitely has reduced redness and some hyperpigmentation on my face. Glad that the formulation is super gentle despite having salicylic acid (which has the tendency to burn and irritate my skin, which inadvertently causes even more breakouts). Have no complaints as of yet. It&#x27;s very easy to use, mess free, and absorbs beautifully onto my skin. Great addition to my skin care regimen!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 months and it has helped reduce the sun spots on my face.  Products smells nice and citrusy ,  dries quickly with no sticky residue.  I highly recommend  this.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all in one type product when I purchased this. After about a month of using it , I didn&#x27;t experience any breakouts, actually I think it helped to keep the monthly hormonal cystic acne down. This is not a moisturizer so you definitely need to put something after applying. It has a nice citrus smell and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Loving it so far awesome smell very light perfect for summer can&#x27;t say enough</li>
    <li> This has become my new nightly favorite. I had been suffering from the saddest adult acne on my forehead and between my brows until I was introduced to this miracle serum; literally, that it what it should be called. Since using this for roughly 2-3 months now, my skin has cleared up completely. I highly recommend using this with the Instanatural Night Cream, they are a winning pair!</li>
    <li> I  tried lots of products for my  a bit of a braking out skin, from arbonne to regular store brand items. It  helped me clear out a lot and it also leaves me with a nice smooth skin feeling. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about  weeks and I can see a difference, not to significant. I am going to order one more bottle and try it for another month and see if the results are better.</li>
    <li> Product is beyond my expectations! I have had years of sun damage and actinic pre-cancerous areas on my face, and tried many, many products and nothing has done such a great job. Wish I had taken before and after shots!</li>
    <li> So far this product has worked well for me.  Haven&#x27;t used for very long, but satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> smells great! I put this on every night before bed before moisturizing and within a few weeks my skin was clearer and more even, great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love it!  I am wondering how Vitamin C serum is and if that will work for my face, but this one is great</li>
    <li> My overall experience with this product was great the smell of the product was not overwhelming at all. I love that the product had vitamin c which I love, I just love the fact that the product is natural. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines in my face but I have dark spots and uneven skin and I did notice a slight change in the tone of my face which was great. I look forward to seeing the changes in my skin the more I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Very surprised with how nice this serum feels on my skin and I have noticed real improvement in my skin.  I am purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and feels much more comfortable to wear than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This has cleared up my acne as well as my acne marks, excellent customer service as well. I HIGHLY recommend this brand and their other acne products.</li>
    <li> Fabulous - as good as high-end serums for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I do believe this product works; face is softer with lightened dark spots after only 2 weeks use at bedtime. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I noticed a huge improvement in my skin - maybe some relative plumping and smoothing if anything. It definitely made my face burn and seemed a little reddened even with very infrequent use. My mild acne was completely unaffected as well. Not the best stuff ever and not the worst.</li>
    <li> I really love this serum. My face is smooth and my complexion is better than ever. My husband even noticed without me saying anything. After I told him what I was using he had me order him a bottle. He is loving it as well. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help my teenager with acne.  It has worked wonders when no other product did.  I am going to get some for me to try.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product and can see my fine lines diminishing after 2 months of use.  I love the smell and that InstaNatural is absorbed very quickly, ready for moisturizer in a couple of minutes.  The price is great so I don&#x27;t feel that I have to count the drops!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! Makes my skin smoother and brighter. I didn&#x27;t use it for a week and noticed the difference in my skin looking more dull and breakouts coming back.</li>
    <li> I seen results within two weeks. Blemishes are disappearing, acne nearly gone, and my skin is smoother and brighter. This product is definitely my new daily skin regimen!</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Its only been about a week that I&#x27;ve been using this product, but I&#x27;m already seeing a difference in my skin.  I experienced some peeling, but I was actually glad to see that.</li>
    <li> This serum is a little thicker than I thought it would be but it sinks in quickly and hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3-4 weeks and my complexion is brighter.  So far I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I personally have a problem with hyaluronic acid because it seems to break me out. Have used this in other products. But I love Instanatural&#x27;s toner. It has done wonders for my complexion.</li>
    <li> I love it!  This serum leaves my skin feeling silky soft.   I live in Arizona where we get a lot of sunshine so I only use the product at night as it has contains retinol.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> This feels great on my skin, toned and tight but not dry!</li>
    <li> This really worked for me.  I was having terrible breakouts, one after the other, huge sore lumps appearing under the skin that would then erupt into hideous acne.  Proactive didn&#x27;t seem to work so in my desperation searched adult acne on here and found this product.  Since using it (I am now on my second bottle), I have only had one lump appear and that didn&#x27;t even erupt quite as much.  My acne leaves scars and I don&#x27;t think this product has done ANYTHING to help with those at all however I can&#x27;t complain as my skin is so much clearer.  I use once a day at nighttime as I found it was drying my skin out too much.  For on the spot treatment I also use 10% benzyl peroxide cream that I found on here and these 2 products have worked wonders for me.</li>
    <li> My friend is using it, and she likes it, but it gave a rush and allergy. i guess it totally depends from your skin type.</li>
    <li> Been trying out the 20percent vitamin C serum and since it is fairly hot outside and the serum seemed to come off as I wide my face so I have been using the serum before I go to sleep and this works for me because I now wake up glowing I guess I could say I look forward to looking I the mirror when I get up for the day and I like that and easy for the results that you get</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;m still using my 1st bottle. My face is clearer, smoother, a shade lighter. I&#x27;m buying my 2nd bottle</li>
    <li> I really like your product, removed some wrinkles,softened my facils skin which I really like</li>
    <li> Has really helped to decrease some of the wrinkles. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me, so I am unsatisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reserving comments on this product until I use it a little longer.  I like the product and the way it smells and goes on, but I&#x27;m not sure it is addressing the skin issue I was having.  A little more time.....</li>
    <li> This is thicker serum than I expected but it driesquick, smells so good and its plesant to use, I have used only about a week now so I can&#x27;t see much change, but my complexion seemed brighter since I have been using this serum. I like it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and I&#x27;m noticing some changes. My skin is clearing up and feels n looks much better than before . I will write an update in a few weeks again .</li>
    <li> Serum is a bit thick but feels so soft on my face.  Should I be using a moisturizer with this or is this a stand alone product? It helps clear my skin of acne but also seems to block pores and cause acne.  Yes, clears acne but causes acne. The benefits outweigh my concerns.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was breaking out and it such great reviews.  I had tried other natural products and at first they worked then fizzled out. I love this! I went on a trip to Hawaii and was afraid I was going to break out in the tropical weather. Nope...my skin stayed clear. I was also using heavy waterproof sunscreen and stilled stayed clear. I used morning and night. I am going to order the moisturizer too now that I am back in dryer California. A few drops go a long way.</li>
    <li> This product definitely makes my skin look brighter. It is sticky and feels irritating when used too frequently. I apply it every other night, and only at night as the stickiness of the product would make it less than ideal to wear under a foundation.</li>
    <li> I just wanna say I&#x27;m HAPPY with this stuff, I&#x27;m suffering from cystic acne for more than 5 years. Using this product I can see the big different on my face. The acne heals fast, it made little bit dry but not bad (combine with the moisturizer). Will order again in the future!</li>
    <li> I use this on my 12 year old son as needed. He gets little bumps on his face and arms and his dermatologist called it Keratosis pilaris.  It really started bothering my son when he was 12 so I tried this serum. It is gentle enough and never caused any redness, peeling or burning. It really did help to get rid of the bumps. He has only had a few pimples and this has helped with those as well. Not as quickly as the Zit Stick worked for him but I don&#x27;t want to combine those two on his skin. In fact he only gets a pimple during the time we are not using the serum. If he were an adult maybe he would use it daily but now that the Keratosis pilaris cleared up I don&#x27;t want him using it every day, I just feel at his age less is more. If we notice bumps he uses it for a few days till they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and does not dry sticky or rub off.</li>
    <li> Product met all my expectations. Goes on smooth and feels great on your skin. It&#x27;s lightweight and perfect to wear under your regular moisturizer and foundation.</li>
    <li> After useing it for over two weeks, my acne is still really bad and I&#x27;m nearly out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I recently learned about the miraculous Vit C Serum, and read that L-Ascorbic Acid is the only efficacious form of Vit C and so decided to order this serum from InstaNatural. Needless to say, I was expecting the Vit C to be L-Ascorbic Acid. However, it was only when I received a follow-up Welcome email from InstaNatural that I learned that the Vit C is actually Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, its more stable cousin. I would have liked to have known that up-front before I made my choices.  When I contacted Customer Care at InstaNatural about this, their service was incredible as they patiently and quickly responded to my queries and concerns. End result was I decided to give it a go since I&#x27;d already got the product anyway.  On first application, my skin got red and tingly but it settled down after 30 minutes. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 days now, and every once in a while, I still feel some mild stinging, which I&#x27;m hoping is a sign of it working! I have however, yet to notice any lightening of sun damage spots or reduction in pore size but it&#x27;s early days yet and I&#x27;m hopeful and optimistic.  Happy to say that though I&#x27;ve been using it for just 10 days, it&#x27;s already cleared up my breakouts, which is an unexpected bonus!  11 Mar 15: Update after 5 weeks of usage in conjunction with Rose Water Toner, Hyaluronic Serum and Vit C Moisturiser: There is definitely an improvement in my skin - tauter and smoother, and some fine lines reduced However, no visible difference in reducing pore size. 8 Apr 15: Update after 10 weeks of usage conjunction with Rose Water Toner, Hyaluronic Serum and Vit C Moisturiser: My skin definitely looks more radiant and less tired, but the fine lines and pores are still my ever-faithful companions. That said, I AM 60, but nobody believes it:) The real test will be when my daughter returns after 10 weeks away - she&#x27;ll be able to tell if there&#x27;s been progress!</li>
    <li> these is the most amazing miracle product! i have never never feel more happy in my life like now, i can see how this product change my face problem as soon at the next day to used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend to anyone that has acne problems or that want to see more young and beautiful!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on it&#x27;s overwhelmingly positive reviews. I was slightly skeptical, however, because I have not had 5 star success with many 5 star skincare products in the past. The first night I used this product I woke up with skin that was noticeably smoother and my skin seemed clearer. I have now used the entire bottle, and still love it! My skin is overall much more supple and radiant, and I have receive many compliments on the overall state of my skin. I also use this with one or two drops of Lavender Essential Oil at night, which seems to reduce and inflamed blemishes or irritated spots. I will definitely reorder this again :)</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with InstaNatural&#x27;s products! Not only does this help with aging skin, but is also helps clearing up acne and black heads. I have been using it for a while now and my face is almost completely clear and my complexion looks great! The price you pay for these products is amazing, I would expect them to cost a lot more. Worth buying for sure! This is a very light weight serum that goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. It goes not leave your face feeling greasy or oily. Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with any anti aging product other than a generic moisturizer. However, my face historically does not do well with numerous or synthetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I started slowly with this product- at night, every other evening and then after a week- every night. There was a purging initially with a small breakout- but it did not last and cleared up within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I am a middle aged woman looking for some sort of regime to help with the natural aging process. After several weeks using this product in combination with a moisturizer oil- I am happy to say I do notice a reduction in deeper lines and have experienced a much more even tone and coloring of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the costumer service, quality, ingredient list and price- I highly recommend this product for those looking for a regular anti aging routine. In addition, I will happily continue to use this product myself.</li>
    <li> Ordered it for my mom and she started to see the results few days after starting using it. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Works well under make up. Performs as described.</li>
    <li> Great product and customer service!!! 100% satisfaction!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product- clears my skin.</li>
    <li> works great--had a couple recent breakouts with the hot weather, and this is very soothing and healing</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Since using this serum I have noticed that I have less blackheads, have not had any skin eruptions at all and my pores seem to look smaller.  Hyperpigmentations are coming to the surface and flaking off. One again, instanatural has produced a comprehensive solution with all natural ingredients that works!  Soon my skin regimen will consist of only instanatural products because they work and are affordable!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t saw any difference.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I have been using this for a couple of months and cannot believe the difference in my skin.  It makes your skin smooth and glowing.  I use it twice a day, but you do not have to use a large amount.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I do not normally review the products I purchase on Amazon, but considering my constant struggle with the stubborn skin on my face, I feel that I should share my thoughts on this particular product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not very acne prone, but I do get breakouts on and around my nose, between the eyebrows, and occasionally on my cheeks. This stuff has almost cleared everything up within maybe two weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used almost everyone type of acne medication one could find walking down the skincare aisle with no prevail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is magic. One could expect some slight tingling/burning sensations, but nothing major. Follow the directions and enjoy the results.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this worked. Used it for the past 3 weeks, and had huge improvement in acne. Inflammation reduced, pimples shrunk, hyperpigmentation faded. I don&#x27;t even have to use benzoyl peroxide anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor cons are the lightening properties (you&#x27;ll look paler) and the fact that retinol makes your skin more sensitive in the sun means you should put sunscreen everyday. But like I said, they&#x27;re minor.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, cleared my face big time. The only down side is that the bottle is too small, I finished it in 3 weeks. I switched to InstaNatural Niacinamide Vitamin B3 5% Serum ,Anti Aging Topical Serum for Face ,For Youthful, Fair &amp; Clean Acne Prone Skin 2 OZ. Works the same, bigger bottle, and I am sure it will last me more than a month. Will not buy thid one again.</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my sensitive skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping with my break outs yet &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months. It does give my skin a healthy glow and seems to exfoliate well. I&#x27;m going to continue using it and see if it eventually keeps me from breaking out.</li>
    <li> When I was looking for something to improve my skin condition, I found this product online. After I carefully reading tons of reviews, I decided to give a try. My main concerns were acne scars and sun damaged spots. I am in love with the citrus heavenly smell of this serum. Feels like vitamin C is absorbing into my skin just smelling it. I do see the fade away of sun spots which I am very impressed. Acne scars are taking longer to heal? But I do recognize the difference before and after. I will definitely continue using this serum and purchase again. This is the best serum I have used.</li>
    <li> The serum is definitely good for my combination skin, it feels cleaner. However I can&#x27;t see any benefit regarding my wrinkles/frown lines. Pity...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t explain exactly how this works but I love it. My daughter uses it for acne and I use it for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum because of the amazing list of active ingredients&lt;br /&gt;for the price. I am a male in my forties and before this product I was&lt;br /&gt;mixing two serums at night that are over forty dollars each. This serum&lt;br /&gt;replaces both, at about half the cost of one. I have been using this about&lt;br /&gt;a month and I am surprised how much I like this stuff. It absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;but has enough \\&quot;slip\\&quot; that a small amount goes a long way. The light citrus&lt;br /&gt;smell is nice. My skin is smoother, pores look smaller and the small bumps on&lt;br /&gt;my forehead are gone. I really appreciate the gender neutral packaging&lt;br /&gt;and the no animal testing policy of this company. I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this to anyone looking for an effective multi-tasking serum. Now I&#x27;m eager&lt;br /&gt;to try other products by this company.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a serum that has more natural contents for a long time. I bought this product few weeks ago. I have acne prone skin and scar ( yup all kinds of :( ) and have tried a lot of products (from CVS to R+F products). I think I will stick with this one for a while as it is so light on my skin and has a good smell. So far, it&#x27;s been helping me to control my acne and the scars feel like fading away slowly. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> On day 4. Absolutely love this serum.  Crazy.</li>
    <li> Great serum. Works well with the rest of the range. Good results when used together. Light and well absorbed. Well-priced also! Actually, a fantastic range for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I saw improvements in my skin within a week.  I&#x27;m already on my 2nd bottle and will order other products to try.  Works amazingly!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a little over a month now and I think it is well worth the money! A little goes a long way so a bottle will last. I have not used the serum as part of a daily morning/night regimen but I make sure to put it on at night when I have blemishes on my face that need to clear up and/or heal. I see a difference in my complexion overnight! The combination of ingredients are perfect for resolving multiple skin problems with one serum...the salicylic acid helps with pimples, clogged pores, oil prone skin (which is what I have)...retinol helps with smoothing and lines/wrinkles...hyaluronic acid is a great moisturizer (don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; part scare you...I previously bought a bottle of pure hyaluronic acid to use after exfoliating peels/treatments and it is a wonderful lightweight way to moisturize your skin)...among other benefits of this product. Great price for all that it does...I think it works better than some of the pricier skin treatments on the market!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is working or not.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! I love the way it makes my skin feel!! I wish I could bath in it!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product every other and have noticed a significant change in my skin texture!</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product especially for the price! My skin is brightening up and lines/ wrinkles are beginning to soften. Only been using about a month, so excited to see results at the end of the bottle!</li>
    <li> The product exceeded my expectations. It significantly improves the skin. I plan to use it regularly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Not sure why there were such positive reviews. Didn&#x27;t work for me. Dark spots are still apparent and used for 2 weeks.  Also did research on how retinol and salicylic acid should not be mixed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 days and my skin is completely clear of blemishes and usual constant breakout. Nothing has worked in the past. I am thrilled!</li>
    <li> After struggling with moderate acne for the lat 13 years, this is the first product that I&#x27;ve purchased more than once!! (which means It actually works!!)</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work.  Used it when my supply of Jessica Wu was depleted. What a difference.  Within days my face lost some of the benefits from the Wu product.  The company did send my a nice email  and refunded my money, after I wrote the negative review.</li>
    <li> Used this for about a month and a half every night, and the first time I used it, I noticed my skin was brighter the morning after. However, after a while, about two weeks in, it stopped giving me that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; in the morning, and my acne began to get worse. I know with skincare products, sometimes the skin goes through a &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; stage, so I kept going, but saw no improvement. Perhaps my skin is just resistant/sensitive to products, but I was pretty disappointed and have about half a bottle of wasted product left.</li>
    <li> I was really hopeful for this product. After reading the rave reviews, I was excited to find something that will remove dark spots while attacking acne. I bought this product in February 2015. It&#x27;s been two months and it somewhat cleared up the left side of my face. My right side is covered in breakouts; however, I do not believe it&#x27;s because of this product. Maybe I&#x27;m not applying it correctly. I will continue to finish the bottle to see if any changes will occur.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel softer.  I have existing dark spots and tend to continue to get them. It has lightened my existing dark spots and improved my overall complexion. I am buying another bottle and recommending it to my mom!</li>
    <li> I am 45 and not embarrassed to say so and this stuff works great. My husband noticed and told me he noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and I don&#x27;t feel the need to wear as much makeup as before. And have to mention dark spots are going away and even old chicken pox scars fading, I got the chicken pox from my son when I was 26 years old and left marks (I got them bad) they have become much less noticeable and my husband agrees so it&#x27;s not just wishful thinking. I will definitely purchase this again when I get low since very little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about 6 weeks now. I dont see any dramatic changes in my skin tone but I do like the product. I would probaby buy it again :)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best skin care product that I have ever found.  I have added to my regular regiment and now almost never break out (which was not the case before).  I do also think it helps with fine lines.</li>
    <li> I strongly believe I have seen a difference with this product.  My aging brown spots have definitely faded.  Also, you don&#x27;t have to use that much of the product when applying it to you face.  I used it morning and night underneath my moisturizer.  Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> I noticed more even skin and brighter skin tone and lightened sun damage after a couple of weeks. I am 35 and grew up in the sun so starting the battle against the past damage. I like that this product has salicylic acid and isn&#x27;t greasy as I&#x27;m prone to oily an t-zone. Great product for the price. I purchased more!</li>
    <li> I have to say it does help with my crows feet.  On the down side.  It makes my face breakout.  It is a heavier oil base.  I never have breakouts but have since using this and these are big, lumpy pimples. My option is to use this on my crows feet and use Hyaluronic Acid Serum - BEST Anti-Aging Skin Care Product for Face With Vitamin C Serum, Vitamin E &amp; Green Tea - Reduces Wrinkles, Fine Lines, &amp; More - For Youthful &amp; Radiant Skin - InstaNatural - 2 OZ on the rest of my face.  I have more luck with this products and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> Wow - I have been using for about three weeks and it gave me a huge pimple in the middle of my cheek. I haven&#x27;t had a huge pimple in a long time. I&#x27;m going to continue to use since maybe it was just bringing it to the surface. I will try to remember to return after using for a longer period of time and let you know if anything else pops up or if this was just an initial adjustment. As far as wrinkles, I don&#x27;t see any visible difference. As far as shipping, everything arrived on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Updated from 3 to 4 stars after ordering my second bottle. After the initial pimples, my skin did calm down and it does seem to improve the overall quality of the skin as far as pore size and blemishes. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement on the wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
    <li> Need more time to see how I like it, but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> This one does it all .. Serums are awesome couple 2-3 drops and they do magic and I use more then one serum after cleaning and toning and then one cream ... I just saw I forgot to order the eye cream ... As you can see I like them all .. I just got the brightening serum and love love it and the scrub ( WHAT I DONT LIKE IS YOU SENDING ME ONE FOR FREE AND CHARGING ME FOR IT WITHOUT MY CONCENT THOSE KIND IF SNEAKY THINGS TURN ME OFF)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, hoping that it will lighten up some acne scars that I had. However, after using almost the whole bottle, I did not notice any difference towards my acne scars. For a while towards the third week that I was using it, I noticed that the retinol may have had some positive effects on my cystic acne. However, my acne flared up towards the fourth and fifth week. This may have been a result of my intake of whey protein as opposed to this product&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I know they have a satisfaction guaranteed policy, I contacted customer service and was issued a payment within two days. It was very hassle free, which I really appreciated. It isn&#x27;t an expensive product so I wouldn&#x27;t have minded too much if I didn&#x27;t get my money back but the fact that I did and it was so easy made me really appreciate their customer service team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the product didn&#x27;t work for me but it may work for someone else - it&#x27;s worth a shot with their satisfaction guaranteed policy!</li>
    <li> I bought this wonderful serum less than a month ago based on a number of factors. For most of my adult life I bought over priced and over hyped skin care products from department store cosmetic brands. Some of them were effective at improving my skin, but a vast number were more effective at draining my checking account than keeping my wrinkles at bay. Finally I decided to use my science based education and start focusing on the ingredient lists of a specific product rather than the marketing. What a discovery! With some research, I started buying skin care products with the specific ingredients that were known to target my personal skin needs. I soon found great products at affordable prices that made visible improvements in my skin because the products had ingredients in high enough concentration to actually help my skin. This Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum made by Insta Natural is a superb example of my ingredient-based research. I read the Ingredient List very carefully and realized this serum&#x27;s ingredients matched my needs very well, was just what I was looking for and at a great price. The high concentration of Vitamin C plus the retinol and other skin loving ingredients sold me on this serum, as well as the affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the serum and was pleased with the prompt delivery and damage proof packaging. I immediately started using it as directed and twice a day. The serum is not oily. It has a silky sort of feel to it and was quickly absorbed. The smell was very light and pleasant, to my nose anyway. I did not feel any stinging or irritation. There was only a nice firming feel to the serum. I found that patting the serum onto my skin and then pressing the serum into my skin with the palms of my hands worked better than &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; it onto my skin. I used it on my face, neck, and chest before applying any creams. Because of the high concentration of Vitamin C, retinol and AHA, I avoided putting the serum in the corners of my mouth and near the entrance of my nostrils because these areas of my face are sensitive to these ingredients. After several days I noticed a definite improvement in the texture, tone, and areas of discoloration of my skin. For some reason, this really showed on my neck and chest, which was a very nice surprise! Being in my 60&#x27;s, I notice any changes for the better in my skin. I also noted the lines in my forehead were smoothing out. Of course it is too soon to realistically judge how the serum will improve my skin over time, but I am optimistic. I will certainly keep using this serum on a twice a day basis. I really enjoy everything about this product and would recommend it to my friends (of all ages) as a very well formulated, pleasant to use and effective skin care product. ( FYI, I was not asked to review this product, nor did I receive free product for a review. ) As a side note, I would encourage everyone to learn how to read and understand any product&#x27;s ingredient list and research those ingredients as to what they are known to do and in what concentration the ingredient is most effective. We ladies spend a lot of our money on skin care. It only makes sense to become knowledgable about what we are buying. Plus we want to use only what is known to scientifically work based on sound research. After all we want results! lol The internet and some time make that possible. So do your homework, save a lot of money and most important, have beautiful skin at any age! I hope this review was useful. I am very pleased with this serum and look forward to using it in the future!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about InstaNatural products and service.  They are A#1 in my book.  If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;re looking for affordable all natural ingredients that are non allergenic.  That&#x27;s why I like this company + that their products are made in the US, b/c that means they list the ingredients clearly.  This product goes on smooth and non greasy.  Thank you InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did not help acne or my acne scars. I just felt a burning annoying sensation for half an hour to an hour or so. Peeling of the skin did occur on some parts of the skin. This product might have work for others, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Good product, would recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff congested my skin and broke me out so bad.  I do not add products to my regiment often and so I thought this was the cause.  After I stopped using it my skinned cleared right up but now I am working getting rid of the scars.  I was so mad and I threw it away.  I am not sure if the reviews are real and I will do more research next.</li>
    <li> So far I am very happy with the instaNatural products. I am obsessed with products in general (face/hair) and I often impulsively buy and then I am unimpressed with the results. This was one of my first impulsive buys that I am really happy with. I have been using the products for weeks &amp; it has really cleared my skin up &amp; seems to be helping overall appearance of skin. I have a closet full of products from department stores, Target, CVS, Sephora, online &amp; recently have been using Roden Fields product line (makers of proactive for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin). I am 35 and really trying to find products that will prevent/slow down the aging process. This product, so far, seems great. Probably up there with some of my favorites . Overall, I would recommend. I also really appreciate the feedback from InstaNatural via email. They really seem to value users&#x27; opinions &amp; make sure customers are happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Honestly this is the best serum I had ever used and I&#x27;m a product junkie. I used to break out on my chin every month and it would leave scars. Since I started using this serum, all my scars had faded and i finally have clear skin.</li>
    <li> Finally found something that works for me. I used to use Neutrogena retinol &amp; salilic acid but they discontinued it.</li>
    <li> Using the Serum for a few weeks now. Skin seems a little firmer and smoother. Some of those &#x27;bumps&#x27; that never went away are beginning to diminish. Will definitely reorder. I think I found my new supplier of skin care. Very excited! Affordable improvement! Who could ask for more!</li>
    <li> My husband and I are both very satisfied with this product. I don&#x27;t know if it is the combination of using this serum and the other products by Instanatural but it has improved the smoothness of our skin and decreased the look of pores on our nose. My only concern and again I&#x27;m not if it is the result of the combination of all the products that we use (cleanser, toner, serum, and moisturizer) but I&#x27;m noticing dry spots on my skin after about 3 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with a facewash that contains AHA to add to my prescription routine because I was still struggling with hormonal breakouts on my chin. I have been able to use this serum under my presciption topicals and under makeup and I believe it has helped prevent the huge blemishes I was getting. I also think it helps speed healing of the few smaller blemishes I still get. The serum also smells nice, sort of like oranges.</li>
    <li> Received product when promised.  Package was intact when I received it.  Goes on smooth and has a pleasant citrus fragrance.  The company sent product use directions via email.  I followed the instructions, especially about using a toner after cleansing so the product absorbs into skin better.  I have not yet seen any improvements in the 3 weeks or so I have been using it.  Also I need a moisturizer ( after the vit C serum dries) on top of it as my skin is very dry.</li>
    <li> Have been using for 2 weeks now. I had minimal acne and was just buying this to replace the products I purchased from acne.org. Needless to say, my acne is as bad as it has ever been. I figured that it was normal for a breakout at first, but this is not normal. Going back to the original products since they actually worked.</li>
    <li> First time user and so far it&#x27;s great!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Very fresh smell and it helps with the redness and acne scars on my face</li>
    <li> The product surpassed my expectations. There were almost instant results. Within a week of using the serum I noticed the dark uneven tones had lighten. Some dark spots are gone. I am very pleased with my skin. Already, I have received compliments on the appearance of my face. I would gladly recommend the serum to others who are  troubled with an uneven complexion. As a last tip, I use it sparingly. I have been using the product about three weeks.</li>
    <li> Product is nice and adsorbs quickly. Doesn&#x27;t leave shiny residue which is always nice :) Asked seller if I could add tea tree oil to product and received an instant and informative reply. In case anyone is wondering.. they said it probably isn&#x27;t needed because of the other ingredients in bottle (would make product too harsh) but if you have resilient skin you could use it sparingly. Overall, I would recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Cheap packaging, cap came away from dropper immediately.  After re-attaching, I find the product too liquid, would prefer thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Results not so detectable</li>
    <li> I use this every night after I wash my face.  I really like it.  It makes my skin soft and smooth.  I also feel like it helps keep my slight acne at bay.  If I do have a breakout it only lasts a day.  I usually bounce from product to product because I find one that works for awhile but by the time I&#x27;m done with the bottle it&#x27;s stopped working.  I actually just bought my second bottle of this product because it&#x27;s still working!  My first bottle lasted 3 months!  Definitely worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It goes on like silk and absorbs quickly with no stickyness,  just silky skin. I look forward to clearer more uniform  complexion.  I use the serum first under my  moisturizer.  Then I apply  my make up and I am good to go.</li>
    <li> I received this product free in order to review.  I would love to give it a higher review as the ingredients are amazing... all natural!! However, my complaint is that this product is super strong for the novice and the company errs on the side of caution. There are no warnings or instructions included. I am a natural redhead and I have a very sensitive skin, and when I applied this product it started to burn like fire. I immediately washed it off but the burning continued, no matter what I did!! Now, 2 days later it is still burning and my face has red blotches and is flaking. I have consulted an aesthetician who says it will take another few days for the reaction to settle down. She said I should probably have diluted it. Also there may simply be too many ingredients in the formula... retinol and Vit C are a mighty pair and tea tree oil can also burn the skin. My advice is that the seller puts some instructions and warnings on this site and in the packaging.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I can see a slight difference in some of my lines. I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
    <li> I have very, very oily skin and all of my pores are clogged all the time no matter what I do.  This is a great serum! It has helped me to get rid of dead skin on my face so I don&#x27;t get so many clogged pores.  I find that it also mosturizes my skin, probably because of the natural oils it contains. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I can wear it under makeup.  I use this regularly, and  it lessens the appearance of my pores. I liked it so much that I bought a second bottle and most skin products only last through one bottle for me before I go on to something else. Ths has helped to balance my skin. I am much less oily now after using it for 4 months every day.</li>

We really appreciate it and we&#x27;re glad you loved the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure you were trying to leave a product review but what you have actually written here is &amp;#34;seller feedback&amp;#34;. In other words, it&#x27;s not a product review that Amazon other shoppers can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be SUPER helpful if you could take just 60 seconds and paste this feedback that you wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;m enjoying my serum and the balance my skin is experiencing haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic improvements but my skin is still tight and youthful! But I&#x27;m sure The benefits will come later!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Used the product for a few weeks and my skin does feel smoother and acne has begun to clear up.</li>
    <li> It really works !! I bought this and I am completely acne free :) :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t rate this a 5 star because I have not tried any other retinol products. That said I have noticed positive results after just a few weeks of use. I used to use alpha hydrox and noticed no difference. After using this product I have noticed a few of my red blotches have faded and some lines near my eyes seem to have filled in. It has not irritated my skin as some other products have.  I will probably continue to use. I may check back in a few weeks and be able to rate this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to clarify that this is not a paid review. I see some people have posted that most of the 5 star reviews are paid. Secondly, I am aware we all react differently to products. Lastly, this stuff must be made of angel baby happy tears. I suffer from adult acne (why won&#x27;t it go away?!). My sister also suffers from adult acne. I purchased a bottle of this stuff for myself to try and I didn&#x27;t expect the results I gained from using this. I also was skeptical of my results but went ahead and purchased a bottle for my sister as she was really feeling down about her skin. I hate to see my loved ones feeling down. After about one week of her using this formula day and night, her skin is clearing and I can tell she&#x27;s much happier. It did take the postal service forever and a day to deliver, and I complained to the company and they sent me a complimentary bottle of the vitamin C serum. It wasn&#x27;t their fault USPS sent the package halfway across the country in another direction, but yet they wanted to satisfy a dissatisfied customer. I am very pleased with this company and with my skin and also over the moon for my sister. I will be purchasing more products from this company.</li>
    <li> Im still using, didnt observe the effect yet</li>
    <li> Rather useless product.</li>
    <li> This formula was what I have been looking for in a serum, InstaNatural  delivered. I have been using this for about a month. I have melasma dark spots  and this has definitely improved that condition by fading those areas, plus smoother skin. It does tingle when first applied, but doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Have not seen a noticable and tremendous change as yet.</li>
    <li> I was using a very expensive Arbonne product, Intensive Renewal Serum and I have to say that I am very surprised at the comparable results of this product considering the difference in price.  It has only been about 3 weeks but my skin looks and feels great.  I have a lot of dark patches on my skin that have not improved much yet but they have not gotten any worse which I was concerned about because I did have good results with the Arbonne product.  I use it religiously morning and night so will see what happens over the next few weeks.  I am very satisfied and the price is excellent considering what I was spending on my previous serum.</li>
    <li> I tried another brand but this one is better. It has worked so fast to diminish the melasma that I&#x27;ve struggled with for so many years. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice/day for a few weeks.  I am very happy with how it makes my skin feel.  I was also very impressed with the personal touch when I received an e-mail about the product.  I also asked a question and received a prompt response.  Not at all like most vendors who you never hear from. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Applies on well. Dries out pretty quickly but following up with moisturizer helps</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. A friend recommended it to me when I said I wanted a serum for both acne &amp; anti-aging. After trying this serum, I would 100% recommend it to others. I&#x27;m already almost done with my first bottle and it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks -- I&#x27;ve been using the serum religiously each night before bed. It truly is a miracle product! It has exceeded my expectations in clearing up my skin.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling since you don&#x27;t have to take all your separate bottles! Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I feel compelled to write a review because this product amazes me. I was looking for something that could help with sun damage spots. I wasn&#x27;t expecting my skin to also soften, brighten up and overall just look and feel healthier. And just within under 4 weeks. By far, the most effective product I have ever used!</li>
    <li> It si ok but i do not think It works for acné And dark spots</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle and I absolute love it. Just four drops morning and evening. Be sure to wear sunscreen after using. I can definitely see a difference in my skin. Can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product a short time, and so far have been very pleased with the results.  I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> I decided to get this product because I have many dark marks on my face from acne scarring caused by my hormones. I got the product on time and was amazed by the customer service this company has. I received it on Tuesday, it is now Sunday and I have already seen results. My skin is brighter, my dark marks are lightening, and my face is more toned. I will repurchase in the hope that within a couple weeks they will dissapear. Love this product! My advice to you is to follow up with a moisturizer and only use a few drops for your whole face. It is very concentrated!</li>
    <li> After reading such good reports &amp; the fact that it was a more natural product, I thought I&#x27;d try it. Within a week or 10 days, I noticed a evenness or smoothness to my skin. I think too that my brown spots looked lighter &amp; overall I&#x27;ve had a nicer glow. I&#x27;m very pleased, so much so that I bought a few more of their products. I give it 4 stars as I would like to have had better results with my brown spots, but a change was notable to me.</li>
    <li> Fine quality serum at great price compared to others with high concentrations of active ingredients. Absorbs quickly and my skin responds very well to this formula.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for myself but when I read the reviews that it is good for acne and pimples I gave this to my 18 year old  daughter to treat her acne, after 2 weeks of using it her face was clear and acne was gone.  For the past 2 years my daughter has been trying different acne products and none of them works.  Now I will get another one for my 23 yr old  daughter because of school stress she stared having acne.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  So glad I gave it a try, I can&#x27;t do without now!  I use it morning and evening, my face feels fresh, soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Vitamin C and this has 20 percent with Retinol.  This is my night &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; and my skin looks amazing for my age.  66 years.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - I&#x27;ve been struggling to get my acne to clear up but heading into my 30s, also want to be proactive about fine lines, sun spots, etc...truly the best of both worlds without nasty ingredients!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, product was exactly what was advertised. Noticed a difference the first night.</li>
    <li> This works great, does what it describes. Ive only used it for two days and can see a difference</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading literally hundreds of reviews . I know Vitamin C is important to your skin. I keep it in the refrigerator. At first I was skeptical because my daughter&#x27;s friend said only Retin A would work. After 5 weeks I can see a definite difference. I feel like my skin looks and feels younger. I had become obsessed with my wrinkles . Now I see smooth skin. Thanks</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything on my skin. I have fine wrinkles, couples blemishes, but overall my skin is Ok. This product did not improve anything yet, but it has nice texture, smells good. I didn&#x27;t experience any side effects or burning sensation, I just applied according to instructions along with moisturizer.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re expecting a skin-changing miracle in a bottle, you&#x27;re probably not going to find one anywhere at any price. But I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive serums than this one and I like this one better. First of all, after several weeks of consistent daily use, my skin is definitely smoother and the overall tone seems to be brighter. Also, I have not had a single breakout since using this product, and I have very oily skin, so almost everything causes breakouts. This serum does not leave my skin oily. It absorbs completely and makeup goes on smoothly over it. It does not irritate my skin, but I do not have sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s possible that with the retinol it might irritate very sensitive skin types. The texture and scent are light and pleasant. For the price, I am pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing, since I&#x27;ve seen fewer results (and more breakouts) from much pricier products. This may not work for everyone but considering the price (it&#x27;s not a tiny bottle and a few drops is all you need) I would consider it worth trying.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I used it this morning and didn&#x27;t even have to wear makeup.  Tightens fine lines very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and saying I&#x27;m seriously impressed would be an understatement. This is coming from someone who has used Vitamin C serums, retinol&#x27;s and salicylic acids for years now. I really ended up ordering this as a back up for a Niacinamide gel by another brand and because the addition of salicylic acid is rather unique for a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this arrived I had suffered bad wind burn on my cheeks to the point of looking like I was wearing fuschia blush. The first night I put this on within thirty minutes the redness was nearly gone. The next day it completely was. Considering all the different anti-redness skincare products I have purchased over the years which did absolutely nothing, or worse, further irritated my skin, this was major. Since then I&#x27;ve been using it every day and I would say a good 80% of the redness is gone from my face. I&#x27;ve also been using it directly under my eyes after a derm suggested retinol&#x27;s mixed with Niacinamide and Hyaluronic acid to help break up under eye dark circle melanin. A use I hadn&#x27;t even planned for with this but have been doing without any ill effects (milia bumps, watery eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thick milky gel similar to Elmer&#x27;s glue the serum itself, despite all the acids present, is actually rather moisturizing and acts the way a primer would under makeup. Yet it&#x27;s thankfully silicon free. It also has a citrus scent of pink grapefruit and oranges with a bit of the ylang ylang. Because of those particular essential oils and the acids a SPF is a must but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed this causing any sun sensitivity. Now that I see how well 3.5% Niacinamide works I&#x27;m really interested in their 5% Niacinamide serum as well. Glad I took a chance and purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural provided a discount for review.</li>
    <li> I must own almost all of instanatural face products. I have continuously been blown away by their other facial products and probably own over half their products. I have loved everything that I have bought from instanatural. I regularly buy from this company and give them as gifts to friends. I recently purchased 4 of these to give to friends but have been disappointed by the results. I believe my face is allergic or has a reaction to an ingredient of this serum. I gave two to my sister and she was also unhappy of its results and made her breakout more, even with a good acne cleanser. I love their products, have thought about becoming a rep for the co :), unfortunately, it&#x27;s just this serum that did not seem to work well with my skin. March 24, 2015 Within 12 hrs of posting my review, the company contacted me and issued a refund for the bottles of serum that did not work on my face. No return of the bottles necessary. Purchasing from instanaturals is a win, win. If the product does not work with your skin type, they stand behind their product 100 percent. It&#x27;s tough to find this type of service and care in the world today.</li>
    <li> Love these products.....Will order again</li>
    <li> I am using is for wrinkles, and skin texture and my daughter is using it for acne. We are on our 4th bottle and are both liking the results. It has a nice fruity smell, isn&#x27;t caustic, and accepts moisturizer and makeup without getting sticky.</li>
    <li> Good product. Calmed my roseasea down as well as the antiobiotics (without the over-the-top sun sensitivity). Just regular sun sensitivity.</li>
    <li> DEf helped with my acne prone skin! You will have to hydrate it though a lot too. My skin also looks tighter and younger and pores are less visible.</li>
    <li> On my 3rd order. Tried many other vitamin c serums this is by far the best</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I have now used the entire bottle and can truthfully say that I see no visible changes in my skin. The unevenness of skin tone is the same, there has been no lightening of dark spots and the overall quality of my skin is no better than if I used a good lotion, In fact my skin looks better when I use a good lotion. I read those other reviews and frankly wonder if they had their eyes closed. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It feels like the expensive name brand product.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the effect yet.  Definitely feels good on my face.  Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on 4/29/16:  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.  I&#x27;m a repeat customer.  This is the third time I bought from this company.  I bought this product again since the first bottle is running out.  I also bought another vitamin C serum from this company.  I like this one better, so I&#x27;m going back to this one again.  I use this product as my morning and evening facial routine.  I used to use an expensive name brand.  After I tried this brand, I found it works as well as the name brand.  I really don&#x27;t feel any difference.  So I&#x27;m using this brand now.  Delivery is fast.  Customer service is superb.  Right after I bought the first bottle, an email came with instructions for usage of the product.  One month latter I received an email inquiry about possible issues I have with the product.  Although I don&#x27;t have any concerns about the product, I appreciate the proactive customer outreach.  I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> Lovely texture, cleared my skin quickly, no odor - great product!</li>
    <li> I love this . I ride motorcycle a lot and boy does this help my skin out .I get  too much sun and not enough sun screen on my face  when you ride all day for weeks at a time . My skin doesn&#x27;t  look like a Shriveled up  old lady&#x27;s .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I do not know what happened but it made my skin itch to hell. Gave me these huge cysts on both sides of my face that I am still trying to heal from my use in June we are in August now. My face is now scarred. I have not changed anything else in my routine other than this product.</li>
    <li> tried it for three weeks &amp; saw nothing happen</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for many months now and it has drastically help to clear up my skin. Im 23 with cystic acne, also with white heads and black heads. While I had to focus on my hormones to help my cystic acne, this has been a good add on to clear up my skin. Over the counter products just don&#x27;t work, and prescription stuff made my acne worse, but instanatural&#x27;s products are clean pur&amp;eacute; potent and EFFECTIVE. I recommend this to anyone suffering from acne, and even if you aren&#x27;t I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll help in some way. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I&#x27;ve also added on instanatural&#x27;s skin brightening scrub, retinol serum, rose water, and retinol moisturizer. With this combination I now just get pimples here and there, and not everyday! Now I&#x27;m just working on healing my ice pick scars and dark marks. The darks marks have been lightening up alot with my instanatural product combination. I&#x27;m doing dermarolling for my ice pick scars, and just purchased instanturals stretch mark and scar cream. I&#x27;ll be adding that to my dermrolling process. Also they&#x27;re customer service is very helpful and gets you on the line quickly, AND shipping is fast. I always get my products within 2 days. And packaging is always in tact and sealed. In conclusion - Amazing products, amazing company! I recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is the most fabulous serum I have ever used.I am really impressed with the results.Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase. So glad I did.</li>
    <li> So far using this product has not caused any irritation, as far as I can evaluate in a short period of use it is at least as good as using 2.5% retinol&lt;br /&gt;alone and has a good consistency, easy to spread.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! I only recently started paying more attention to my skin health and this has been such a great addition to my facial care products. After one week of using Instanatural&#x27;s face serum, I actually started receiving complements on how young I look! (and yes, this actually happened twice). My facial care products now include Rugged and Dagger exfoliating scrub and moisturizer, and Instanatural&#x27;s face serum and eye gel. My skin is looking better and more youthful by the day! All around great product.</li>
    <li> My skin drives me nuts and has always been oily and prone to major breakouts. I also am a freak about aging and have tried a lot of vitamin c serums and other products to help fade dark spots and keep my face smooth and youthful. Lately, since the weather is humid and unseasonably hot, I have been breaking out more, so I searched and found this perfect solution! I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have any dramatic results and wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, but this has really helped keep my breakouts under control. It also makes my skin feel tighter and look smoother. I was using serums plus a salicytic acne gel, but now, I just use this one product. I started using this with AquaGlycolic toner and I can notice a great improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> A little early to tell as I did not begin using it right away.. Ordering three different items, I didn&#x27;t know if I could use at same time.  So I&#x27;m using it more exclusively right now, and I like the way it goes on, and seems like a little bit goes a long ways, and keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Simple and effective use.</li>
    <li> Nice feeling after application, I believe it makes my skin softer.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice much difference. ( Might take while, since I&#x27;m almost 80 yrs. old!)</li>
    <li> I really like the product so far and the way it keeps my skin soft and moist</li>
    <li> The first two days I used this stuff my face felt so soft, light and fresh and then all of a sudden I broke out with such bad acne. Worse than I ever had it. Retinol can sometimes do that and I&#x27;m also allergic to aloe which I didn&#x27;t realize it was in it. Who knows but one thing I will say is that it&#x27;s like a magic fix for wrinkles. I had one stubborn laugh line that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and this stuff corrected it in a matter of days. I also started using it on my belly for sagging skin and stretch marks and I swear it&#x27;s making a difference. Aside from the hives from the aloe and the random break out I actually still love this stuff. Haha.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any major difference after using this product. It might have reduced the size of a couple pimples, but not enough to really make a difference. There might not be enough in a single bottle to really make any noteworthy differences in your skin. The biggest thing it did was make my skin smell citrusy for a little bit.</li>
    <li> After one month, face feels smoother and not as dry, nice texture and delicate smell, blue veins a little less noticeable, doesn&#x27;t help redness. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all :(</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. You&#x27;ll see a difference in your skin within days of use.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Seiren! I noticed a difference after just a few days. My skin continues to get smoother with a more even skin tone. I am hooked!  I especially love that it is not crazy expensive, very reasonably priced. A very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Smells like oranges which is nice but burns a little when applied. Can&#x27;t really tell a difference on my skin but my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> good~~~~~~~~Love this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy good -- i had adult acne breakouts and after three weeks of using this twice a day after cleansing and toning, my skin has really cleared up!!! I also use the retinol moisturizing cream at night. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Feels fresh but no differencw</li>
    <li> When I first used this product it scared me because I was breaking out a whole lot more specially in my chin area. I was so upset. I discontinued the use but then I decided to try something different. I gave it another chance. I was maybe applying too much before I started to dab it on my face an massaging it in circles. I noticed that this way it got absorbed faster but it still made my skin a little dry. I ended up adding their night cream to my face. I immediately felt a difference. The serum and their night cream are a great duo. In just 3 days I&#x27;ve noticed a healthy glow on my face. The redness has really gone down and the dark spots are going away. Like really going away. I can really see a difference from only 3 days. I like how it smells as well. I gave it 4 stars because it freaked me out at first haha</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I love what it does for my skin.</li>
    <li> great stuff, love it &amp; so does my sister</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I have already noticed a few positive changes. Inflammation (red or blotchy areas), as well as breakouts have diminished. This is really potent stuff. Really like it so far!</li>
    <li> Hopefuly it works, I have had people tell me I look young for my age..Is that a compliment or insult??</li>
    <li> I have been good at using it everyday twice for last two weeks . Do I see any difference ? Not really. May be it takes longer than 2 wks . I will post again in few months if anything changes.  I am trying to get rid of my acne scars and some hyper pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and really love it... Fine lines are going away, dark spots are fading, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a long time.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month now . So far so good</li>
    <li> I absolutely am happy with this! Only used it for a couple weeks but already am seeing a much smoother, softer look to my skin. Great product, and an even greater price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have recvd compliments from coworkers that my skin appears glowing, which is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 and have always had an issue with facial tone, acne and early onset of fine lines, puffy eye bags and crows feet. I&#x27;ve only had this product for nearly 3 weeks now and I love the results so far. My husband was the one who complimented me on wearing makeup today. To which I laughed and informed him I had none on. My face looks brighter and fresh. My skin is well moisturized and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone is slowly but surely evening out. Even my puffiness and crows feet have backed off. Going from a very pricey product like Nirium to this, I was hesitant at first. But I am very pleased to say I&#x27;m loving the results! And the reasonable price and fast shipping make it all the better!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great too</li>
    <li> Not really that impressed. I will give it a little more time, hopefully, I will have a more favorable comment in a few more weeks of trying it out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin, but I do like the fact that it isn&#x27;t greasy and did not make me break out. I figured it can&#x27;t hurt to finish the bottle, but I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Trust me when I say you have to get this!&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin so when I break out, they leave intense, dark scars.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other, more expensive products that claimed to lighten scars but they never worked.&lt;br /&gt;But this serum has improved my skin so drastically.&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, it didn&#x27;t seem like it was doing anything but after putting this on religiously twice a day, for a few weeks, all my scars have lightened to the point where I don&#x27;t feel the need to put on foundation everyday.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a holy grail  product for me and I am so happy I found this!</li>
    <li> Great product absorbs beautifully into the skin - no sticky residue</li>
    <li> My best friend gave me Vitamin C Serum as a gift.  I loved it so much I had to buy another  This product works great!  It goes on smooth and your skin absorbs it immediately.  There is no greasy feeling.  It not only smooths your skin but it also works great on acne.  I apply it directly to breakouts and by the next day I can see them drying up and they&#x27;re usually gone within 3 days (apply daily, morning and night).  Give it try, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Just as described and a good value. Strong so best as a serum with moisturizer. Also very good as a blemish corrector. Will heal it overnight. This is a good product well priced.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This serum is just great!  I use it after using my derma roller, as well as a.m. &amp; p.m.  InstaNatural products (I use 4) really have made a visible difference in my skin!!!!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews and saw they were all pretty good so decided to try this serum along with my new derma roller.  I have moderate acne so I really looked for a serum that helped with that and also other skin improvements. Even though this serum didn&#x27;t work for me, the distributors were very understanding when I reported my results. I started getting tiny white heads in little trails when I never would get them before. I suggest others to give it a try because every skin is different. Awesome customer service thought. Wish it would&#x27;ve worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on and off for a couple of months, I have to say that it seems to be helping with me skin. I feel like it is making the scars look less noticeable and tightens as well. It&#x27;s easy to apply and I like that it&#x27;s in a glass bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I kept getting emails asking me to rate this. I don&#x27;t care for that because if they want a solid, truthful review, at least give me time to use it and for it to work. Only then can I review it for you. Anyway, my face feels nice and soft. Not sold on the wrinkle diminisher aspect of it, but like I said, haven&#x27;t been using it long</li>
    <li> must use this a few more weeks to give a honest evaluation.... two weeks in and so far so good!</li>
    <li> Been using it for about 2-3 weeks, morning &amp; night. Smells like lemons or citrus? After applying, there is a slight tight feeling but nothing uncomfortable. And I&#x27;ve noticed old acne scar dark spots are starting to fade.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product ! I am on my fourth bottle! I have noticed clearer texture overall, fewer breakouts and if I do breakout the spot clears fast ! Very happy with this product. I rarely write reviews and thought this deserved the time !</li>
    <li> I Wait the results, so far it did nothing.</li>
    <li> I suffer from sensitive, Rosacea skin. I often have painful breakouts, itching, and redness. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get control of it to no avail. After just a few days of using this serum, I have virtually no breakouts! My skin feels calm and soothed. This serum complements my Red Rock Organic Rosacea products very well. I wash with Red Rock Rosacea Cleanser, then use the Skin Clearing serum, followed by the Red Rock Rosacea Cream. I&#x27;ve found a winning combination. I still have some redness, but the severity of my condition has been reduced dramatically. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday religiously for over a month and their has been no improvement in my dark spot.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I have recently switched to cleansing my face with just oil and moisturizing my body and face with oils. I use this on my face everday and decollete some days. It does a great job in aiding with what it says and the vitamin C gives an extra brighteness everyday.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it and how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> i try to stay away from some of the ingredients that this product has cuase of my sensitive skin  it has been pretty nuetral</li>
    <li> I didnt see any changes. I got break out, not only one acne at a time but a lot!!! I regret buying this product :( I feel so disappointed.. I have had to paid extra to dermatologist because of this!</li>
    <li> This item is the BEST face product out here!! Has every ingredient in it that a 40+ face needs!! Great line of products, made in USA and all natural. Buy more and get a discount! All items I have purchased from this brand have been great. Hope to TRY them ALL and write MORE AWESOME REVIEWS!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a suggestion to deal with &amp;#34;ingrown hair&amp;#34; problems on my chin area.  I always had tried to dig them out leaving big sores that had to heal.  Using this has allowed the hair to work itself to the surface with no problems.  This was a suggestion from someone else and it works wonderfully!!  No more sores!!</li>
    <li> seeing noticeable results. just ordered more product from this line, including the cleanser, eye gel and other serums to add to my regimen.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to actually see major results, but the serum feels nice on the skin, doesn&#x27;t flake or break me out and absorbs quickly (in case you want to use under make-up). I hope that after a month or so of use I can give a more informed and updated review, but so far, so good. Also, the price is really really good and the ingredients natural.</li>
    <li> the serum smells good (citrus scent), abort fast and it DOES fade away in a month, amazing! (i have been using it in the morning and night time)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple of days and started seeing results. my hyperpigmentation is clearing slowly but surely. I would recommend!!</li>
    <li> Excellent serum! I just purchased my first bottle and I am in love with this product. It is a bare bones anti aging serum but the basic ingredients with no other additives is what makes it especially good for sensitive skin. In addition, who can argue with the price. I try everything including very pricey serums/creams and most of the expensive ones always give my skin a problem. This is a great product. Thanks to everyone for their reviews. It helped me make the decision to purchase. I will continue to use as part of my daily/ nightly regimen.</li>
    <li> This product is great except it made my back break out in a rash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but I am really impressed with a couple of things.  First, my dark spots have almost completely vanished.  I had a few brown spots that seemed to be from hormonal changes, and other spots that were left over acne marks.  Both types have faded significantly, to the point where I even sometimes forget to put concealer on them because they&#x27;re so light.  Before, they really stood out and had to be covered up with make-up.  They were so noticeable.  The second thing is that my skin has really cleared up.  It&#x27;s sad that I&#x27;m in my mid-forties and still have such acne issues, usually around that time of the month, but I&#x27;ve learned to mostly accept it.  This product has done wonders for my face, and basically stopped the break-outs.  That hasn&#x27;t happened to me before.  Amazing!  As for wrinkles and lines, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change.  I&#x27;m hoping that I will soon, though.</li>
    <li> This works! Smoother skin, simple as that.</li>
    <li> I have another I like better</li>
    <li> Rather expensive but, it seems to help reduce some wrinkles around my mouth.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is being touted as the best age defier, and this product is helping to make me a believer!</li>
    <li> I have purchased retinol and Vitamin C serums before, on both Amazon and at Sephora (and paid three times as much at Sephora) and I had never seen a serum that claimed both skin clearing and anti-aging effects. All the reviews seemed good, and the company seemed legit, so I gave it a try. I will say, WOW. This is a great product. It absorbs quickly into the skin, is totally non-greasy, and you can feel it working. The smell is clean, lemony (Vitamin C, I guess) and pleasant. I have not had a breakout since I started using it, and it has my retinol and vitamin c in one step. After washing &amp; toning, use this, moisturize and go. I love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. It has helped my skin dramatically.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for y breakouts or prevent any breakouts. I continued to break out if not even more. I did as the instructions says and honestly this serum did not help at all. I tried it for quite some time and it did not change. I thought if I used it longer it would change but it just made my skin worse. Wish I could return the product.</li>
    <li> This made me breakout and gave me a huge rash/zit on my chin...really bad.</li>
    <li> This product &amp;#34;eats&amp;#34; my skin. My skin feels very itchy after applying them on.</li>
    <li> It is hard to believe the percentage of C and Retinol for this price.  A great value and product</li>
    <li> This is the best of all the serums I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several. This one is great for clearing up acne and for fine wrinkles. It doesn&#x27;t sting at all, and I have relatively sensitive skin. The price is also quite good. Make sure to use sunscreen when you use any skin product with acids in it to avoid getting burned.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the smell is better than the others I have used, and it works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, but it&#x27;s been great for my rosacea! The serum does not seem to burn, itch or make me break out. It has reduced my redness quite a bit - not completely, but I can definitely see a difference. So, for now, I&#x27;m super happy with this product. Here&#x27;s to hoping it stays this way!</li>
    <li> Can I give it six stars.....well if not, there should be.....infinitely better that Ole Henriksen&#x27;s very costly Vitamin C serum.....Henriksen&#x27;s serum has a good texture and body to it, this one is just as good if not better......now results......it has cleared acne better that any of the preparations that are geared for breakouts, including the pricey ($300) one my doctor prescribed....my skin has the luminosity it had years ago.....I recommend as long as you don&#x27;t buy out what I want....no what I need :).....</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I emailed InstaNatural and asked some questions about my type of skin and what products they would recommend.  I had purchased their Facial Oil Cleanser and I loved this product.  They suggested the Anti aging skin clarifying serum.  Well, this is another winner!  I wanted something to lighten age spots.  This product did not eradicate my age spots BUT it did lighten them!  I am pleased with the results.  An added bonus is my skin looks lighter and younger!  My skin is smooth and soft...very supple. I also notice that my skin tone is more even.  If fact, a co worker looked at me and said, &#x27;You look younger!  What are you doing???&#x27;  I told her it must be my new skin regimen.  She then said, &amp;#34; I MUST know what you are doing.....&amp;#34;!  I told her!  These products smell lovely and apply easily.  My goal is to age gracefully.  I am 55 yrs old.  I want products that are more naturally based, reasonably priced for the average consumer, and easy to use.  I think I have found them.</li>
    <li> This works very well. Better than all the products I have ever purchased.  I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and suffered from menopause acne over the last 2 years. It hasn&#x27;t cleared my face up 100% but I&#x27;m sure it will with longer use. I have only been using it about a month.  I think my face is about 95% better than it was before I started using it. I also use Thayers Rose Petals natural witch hazel as my toner. The combination of the 2 seem to have worked perfectly together on my skin. Over the last 2 years I bet I have spent over a thousand dollars and expensive brands at big name stores at the mall. None, not a single one helped my face or skin.  The 2 products I use are by far the least expensive ones I have ever purchased and they are the only ones that ever worked. My 17 year old daughter now uses them also and her skin looks wonderful now also.&lt;br /&gt;*Using it was a little weird at first. It&#x27;s sticky and doesn&#x27;t smear of the face easily for me. I used about a half a dropper or less. I put it on my the first 2 fingers then match them up with the same fingers on the other hand. I tap it all over my face them rub it in. It dries quickly. I didn&#x27;t notice any smell to it. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Insta Natural C Serum comes in a darker blue bottle. It has a bulb to squeeze out the exact amount of product you need. I did one and half just to make sure I got my face and neck all covered. Now you might ask what is this? Well it is a serum with tea tree oil and other properties to help with acne breaking out. If you have skin discoloration this helps with that big time. I have a few and have been using it all over and my darker spots are lightening up. It is nice not to wonder if I don&#x27;t have make up on if it will be patchy looking. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! With this I have been able to go outside with out makeup and that is huge bonus. Now this is not only a product for women but men you can use it too. Remember it is not a in pink girly looking bottle. So I would call this gender neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we get older we start to get sun spots. I am starting to use this on the back of the hand. When I put the serum on there. I feel a nice cooling effect and smoothness. I will continuing using this product. If you haven&#x27;t tried this brand please give them a shot. I will leave you with this extra bonus they are made in the USA and are cruelty free. They don&#x27;t use harmful chemicals. Huge in my book.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this Vit C serum. This is my second bottle of this serum. I use this with the micro-derm roller and it is helping lighten my melasma/hyper-pigmentation. This is the first thing that has helped lighten the melasma mark on my upper lip. I wish I would have taken before and after pics to show, but please take my word for it. The dark spots have not completely vanished but have lightened enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I have to cake my make-up on. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after finishing this second bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I started noticing a difference in my skin in about five days,  and after a couple of weeks&#x27; use,  my skin tone is amazingly even,  without makeup, and looks plumped and fresh.  Looking forward to additional benefits as I use it longer.</li>
    <li> Instructions too small to read</li>
    <li> This product is great~contains all the things I like to use for acne prevention and anti aging!!! I am on my 2nd bottle &amp; use it day &amp; night. This product does make skin dry if used during cold weather. Smells great as well!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I just purchased my 3rd bottle.  I am 62 years old and my skin has never looked better.  I have used this type of product for the last ten years or so but this by far the best!  I am looking forward to trying more products from InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> Make your face really soft and flawless...Love it!</li>
    <li> I Love this product.  Makes my skin feel nice and clean.</li>
    <li> Good quality, does what it says!</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful product and the price is great. Would recommend to all ages. I&#x27;m 57 and my daughter is 16 and we both love it</li>
    <li> I use this product around my eyes and I&#x27;ve noticed it takes that creping look away. I&#x27;m a 44 year old woman living in the Southwest and that could be very drying on the skin. I use this product before I go to sleep each night... I really recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> made my face breakout really bad, I tried the product for about 3 weeks and it did not improve. I wish I had good reaction to it. the vendor did issue a full refund. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. but it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Wow, I love it. It makes your skin feel tight smooth and you definitely will see a difference. The Retinol will makebyour skin tingle a bit if you use it a lot, but it is awesome..</li>
    <li> 1 bottle lasts me 4 months. Keeps skin clear, acne-free, brighter</li>
    <li> I have purchased several facial products in an attempt to reverse the years of sun damage caused by many summers in the the sun. The vitamin C serum is showing the most promising results. After 3 weeks of use I am seeing smoother skin! I&#x27;m actually using less makeup because my skin looks and feels better.</li>
    <li> Very helpful. Nice texture and smell :)</li>
    <li> I liked it.. Only tried for one month and need to order a new shipment... Haven&#x27;t seen a visible result but it makes my skin feel refreshed......</li>
    <li> Love it! It does everything that it claims. My only complaint is the price. I would love to use it all the time but I just can&#x27;t afford the price for such a small bottle. Very sad to not be able to use it anymore but for those that can afford it then I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the changes in the texture of my skin!!! Will definitely order again!!!</li>
    <li> This is a strong serum that actually works. I like how I can feel it working, and I saw results within a few hours. The company has been a pleasure to do business with. They sent me an instructional email before the package arrived. I appreciate that extra attention to detail and quality.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I bought it for my face and started using it on liver spots on my feet after grest results fading old acne scars.  The spots on my feet are fading too!</li>
    <li> This is a nice serum. It&#x27;s not to liquid or sticky. It can be used with or without moisturizer. The smell is pleasant some what citrus like but not over powering. It made my face feel soft. However, it didn&#x27;t get rid of my hyperpigmentation. I don&#x27;t have a lot of dark spots so I expected better results. Also thought it would help with adult acne but no noticeable difference. It worked for only as far as softer skin</li>
    <li> I used one bottle. so far feel pretty good. It did not take away my aging spot though. But it does make my skin feel and look better.&lt;br /&gt;I hardly used any creams before because they irritates my skin. I am 52 now. This is definitely feel better than regular creams.&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it a 5 because it did not help with my dark spot as much.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and this serum works great. I noticed that my skin was immediately smoother. After reading some of the reviews, I was concerned about going through a rough patch (breaking out, flaking skin, etc.) while my skin was getting used to the product, but I haven&#x27;t had a of those experiences. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on my skin! I&#x27;m surprised this product got so many good reviews! It was a waste of money...</li>
    <li> Great product great service love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product a week back. I am using this twice a day followed by the Retinol Cream moisturizer at night. After I moved to California 6 months back, I started getting many acne and so my face has many acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, so far I haven&#x27;t seen the results as described. Infact after using this serum I got few more new acnes, so it seems it is not helping to control my acne yet. Also I don&#x27;t see my blemishes or acne scars reducing as of now. I just felt my complexion to become slightly clearer, not much though. I would consider using this product and waiting for a few more weeks hoping to see some improvement in my skin. I shall update this review once I see some different results.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, tried so many, had so many &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; with too many other products. I&#x27;d find one I liked, use it for years and then they would &amp;#34;New and Improved&amp;#34; it and I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore. This one is glorious! Smells heavenly, goes on smoothly, no heavy oils or creams to weigh my skin down. Best of all, my 67 year old skin is firmer, smoother, less blotchy and I could see a difference after just 2 weeks. So impressed I bought 2 to send to my daughter (she lives in Saudi Arabia) who is just beginning to wrinkle and just beginning to accept advice from her mother. Thank you for a wonderful product. Your challenge: don&#x27;t change a thing!</li>
    <li> I have started to use this serum for barely 3 weeks now and have already started to notice some tightening of the skin around my eyes, which makes the crow feet and other fine lines look somewhat diminished.&lt;br /&gt;It is very encouraging to see this positive result within 3 short weeks.  I did not experience any negative side leffects like burning,  Itching redness etc which is what I was afraid of when I initially started to use it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy or oily. Skin feels very smooth has a nice silky feeling, I would highly recommend this product.  In fact I&#x27;m ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I have fairly good ski n before I tried this product. I was browsing for a vitamin c serum and came across this one with very high rating. It&#x27;s a concoction of everything that is good on the front label. However it&#x27;s not for someone with sensitive and oily skin. I continue to break out for the next two months.end up at the dermatologist this morning.next time will have to be more careful trying a new product....it might cost u a whole lot more at the end.not to mention the emotional state of mind dealing with The sudden breakout</li>
    <li> I only just received this product. So far so good. I love that it isn&#x27;t oily or strong smelling.</li>
    <li> I am VERY disappointed in this Vitamin C Serum, because the product has changed since&lt;br /&gt;the last bottles that I have received. This serum seems thicker and very sticky when I put&lt;br /&gt;it on my face. It takes quite a while before I can apply my moisture or makeup. . It also makes&lt;br /&gt;my face feel very tight and funny feeling. PLEASE, bring back the original serum. When I&lt;br /&gt;applied the old serum on my skin ,it just soaked it in - this new one just seems to sit on top of my skin&lt;br /&gt;until it dries.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months. I haven&#x27;t noticed a visible reduction in age spots or blemishes but it makes my skin feel good and I  believe with continued use I&#x27;ll see better skin.</li>
    <li> I have seen a good improvement in my skin. Already ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> I will never be without this serum EVER.  I use this after my toner and before my moisturizer.  It makes your skin youthful and smooth.  After I started using this a friend mentioned how &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; my skin was looking these days.  Smells good too!  I love these products!  Great affordable line of skin care products that does what they advertise!</li>
    <li> Was a good product. Just wish it had a pump dispenser so that the product didn&#x27;t loose its potency.</li>
    <li> I will continue to see if I notice anything.</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;1. Best of all! No more acne!  I have suffered with adult acne for the past three years and it has left me to where I can&#x27;t even wear make up.  This product has prevented me from getting there except for a Mark here are there. I&#x27;m even on my period right now (see pic) and I barely have anything on my face.&lt;br /&gt;2. It leaves my face feeling nice, tight, &amp; smooth&lt;br /&gt;3. Not greasy at all like moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Can use under make up.&lt;br /&gt;5. Fine lines are minimized and almost gone. FYI I&#x27;m 30!&lt;br /&gt;6.  I parent with my derma roller and it has worked wonders together I use it right after I use my dollar. I also use it in the mornings after I wash my face and at night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> female age 26 combo skin/sensitive asian  i use the serum twice a day and the product seems to help very fine lines around the eyes.  i had a random breakout around my face and was desperate so i turned to this product...  i think it reduced my breakouts but i did use it in conjunction with the aztec clay mask.  i&#x27;m on my second bottle now and i&#x27;m just hoping it will help my face with the hyperpigmentation left from my past breakout.</li>
    <li> Wonderful results with this serum.  I have found a skin care regimen with it that WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> I love this serum, I am 31, I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. this has not broken me out, if anything I have way less break outs than normal, and my skin just glows. I heard about this from my mom (60) and she has dry, sensitive acne prone skin, she raved about it. I just thought id give it a try seeing how natural all the ingredients were and I am not disappointed! I&#x27;ve been replacing all of my skin care products with this line. I use this serum at night before my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Like this product, but doesn&#x27;t clear/prevent acne how it&#x27;s advertised</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a  little over a month and I love it. I am a 30ish year old Asian F with combination skin. I have tried Obagi, Rodan and Fields and various skin regimen over the years. My main problem is I still have ocassional breakouts (huge cystic acne every month) and my skin always looks tired w/multiple dry patches all over. When I first tried it, my neck got irritated and it had these little red bumps so I stopped using it on my neck but continued using it over my face once a day. The serum felt smooth, non-sticky and I loved its citrus-y smell. Before long, my BF noticed that my skin had a glow. I was so excited! My pores are still the same but my skin is definitely smoother. Just the other day when I woke up, I looked into the mirror and thought I already had foundation on. I definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I waited until I had used this product for awhile before posting my review. I&#x27;ve used so many other anti- aging creams that I was a little skeptical about trying &amp;#34; one more&amp;#34;. Well after about 6 weeks, I believe it does minimize fine lines around my eyes and lips. At first, the retinal may make your face a little sensitive, so it&#x27;s important to let the serum dry and then apply a moisturizer. And you have to be consistent with using it. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My skin is starting to show signs of aging and I was told to try vitamin c and I am so glad I did! I love the texture of the product, it feels great on my skin after washing. After using it for about 2 weeks, I feel like it&#x27;s brightened up my face. I had a picture taken of me without makeup on and it was glowing! I have been very impressed with this product! I feel it has smoothed my skin almost immediately, and I definitely plan to continue to use it. I am happy to have received this product to review! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin sticky.  Has an unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> Like all products with salicylic acid, or other acne fighting agents, this one will temporarily (possibly) break you out worse...but never fear, your skin will adjust and become radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not had this long, but already I&#x27;ve noticed improved clarity and overall appearance. I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you only use this 1x a day, just before bed, and then use a light moisturizer in the morning, so you don&#x27;t get dry skin.</li>
    <li> Nice product, feels good on my skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it very long so don&#x27;t have results to report as yet. I believe the previous reviews are accurate and I look forward to using this product daily.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin.  Very pleased this far.</li>
    <li> I really am happy with InstaNatural in general. They introduced me to the Vit C Serum and I fell in love with the results. They keep coming up with more products and each one is just as amazing as the last. I am so surprised that each product is just as pleasing as the next.  This serum has the added Salicylic acid and Retinol for my ever aging face. I am starting to get those pesky fine lines around my eyes and it is just frustrating. The dark spots on my face are lighter and I am happy that this is helping when I have those random blemishes show up. I use this as well as the matching moisturizer from InstaNatural. It is a great pair. There is no burning or skin sensitivity when I use this either. I use 3-4 drops that I drop on to my finger tips then rub all over my face making sure to focus on the dark spots I have as well as around my eyes (not too close).  I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if results are outstanding, but I like the idea of it and it feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product!! I bought this product for 2 bottles at the first time for my gf. And it works great on her. Her face becomes brighter and had bought it for 4 bottles more 2 weeks ago. It&#x27;s been a good product so far. No side effect. And I&#x27;ll buy this product also for myself later.</li>
    <li> I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks, night and day and followed by an Olay Age Defying wrinkle day cream. Honestly I wasn&#x27;t impressed right off the bat, I think it took a few weeks for my face to acclimate to the new serum. I was using Estee Lauder&#x27;s &amp;#34;Perfectionist&amp;#34; serum, which I love but at $160 a bottle I needed to find something more cost effective that worked. So the first week or so my face felt a tad swollen, especially under my eyes and I thought the product may be a dud that also stung a little. However, at the three week mark I did notice that some acne scars around my chin and my uneven skin tone, lightened, redness completely (90%) reduced and complexion evened out, I wasn&#x27;t using the product for this reason so what a bonus! I had micro abrasion for the scars in the past but they weren&#x27;t that noticeable, until they were gone! My goal for using this products was for fine lines and under my eyes, lines and tightening. I would say my skin does look brighter, I haven&#x27;t had a pimple or even close to one the whole time I&#x27;ve used the product, which is rare to go so long without one. So, brighter, clearer, even, erased coloration of light acne scars, and has no lasting stickiness, I love the way it applies and soaks in. Also combines with a moisturizer well and I&#x27;ve actually started wearing less makeup because I don&#x27;t need it. I am not quite sure how the serum will affect the wrinkles but my skin looks radiant  and people have commented on how great it looks, men and women. I&#x27;m 30 yrs old, very fit, exercise, eat healthy, take biotin plus other vitamins and drink plenty of water so this product seems like just what I needed for clearer, better skin. I will monitor closely until the end of the bottle, which is also lasting a long time. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone who desires to manage a aging complexion.  It is a big help to us older gals.  Go ahead!  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> It burns my face and makes  it really dry. Still I noticed a lot of blemishes disappearing. Maybe it&#x27;s best to spot use. I can&#x27;t just spread it all over.</li>
    <li> After using the serum for one week I noticed that my skin started looking clear and more youthful. Now I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, except the one ones on my forehead. However, I did not that my skin started looking healthier and the wrinkles on my forehead seemed to smooth out.</li>
    <li> After a week of use, I have seen a visible improvement in my skin. My acne is starting to clear up! I love this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I saw no difference while using it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well!</li>
    <li> I was a sceptic of any &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; that would reduce fine lines and wrinkles, but I figured I would give it a try. I have used it pretty consistently (before bed and some mornings) for about 2-3 weeks, and I have to admit...IT ACTUALLY WORKS :).  Even my most critical friend who is always telling me I need to get botox again (it&#x27;s been almost 2 years since I had it done), agrees that my skin looks smoother, crows feet are barely visible, and even the lines on my forehead are less defined. My skin now has a glow and it has truly taken off years.  I wish I had taken a before and after picture. Anyway, I am 44 (will be 45 next month UGH), and everybody thinks I am in my mid-30&#x27;s. Now, I&#x27;m just trying to stay that way ;). I use a full dropper full and rub it all over my face, neck, between the boobs (don&#x27;t want those boob wrinkles), on my hands and even my elbows. BTW, it works wherever you use it regularly. My hands never looked younger. I suggest using a moisturising cream about 5-10 minutes after applying the serum.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little skeptical about the efficacy of skin products, but this one has certainly reframed that perception for me. This vitamin c serum has improved my overall skin tone and has worked wonders I drying up pimples. I love that it comes with a dropper as it keeps things mess free for me. The scent is a subtle citrus smell that quickly goes away once it&#x27;s been completely soaked into the skin. Overall, it&#x27;s been an effective product that I cannot see myself without. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with this product. I bought it after reading the ingredients and the reviews. I&#x27;m almost thirty and I live in a ridiculously dry climate. ..and I&#x27;m a light smoker so I have lots of reasons to take care of my face. This product delivered in every regard. I use it at night. If you live in a more humid area, you might not need a second moisturizer, but I follow this with a night cream. It absorbs quickly and has a light, pleasant grapefruit smell. Follow the directions and shake well before applying. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and plan to repurchase it. I have tried hundreds of beauty, anti aging products from sephora and this one excels them all in affordability, effectiveness, and the natural ingredients. If you have any concerns or questions about the product, don&#x27;t hesitate to contact the customer service department. They are stellar.</li>
    <li> Good bang for the buck for an RA product. Smells great (grapefruit-y), but the smell does not linger long. Comes out of the dropper creamy off-white.</li>
    <li> Use it daily every morning after washing my face. Apply moisturizer after that.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works! My acne scars are gone, skin look more radiant and younger soft feeling skin... Will definately buy again....</li>
    <li> Love this and even got my husband using this on spots on his face. That says alot ! love it . Notice the difference in a few days.</li>
    <li> Um... Wow!  I&#x27;m a skin care addict and make up artist.  This has been the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used.  Major change in the appearance of pores and my skin texture.  Been using this for a month and super impressed!</li>
    <li> Has made the texture of my skin smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> After spending hundreds of $$ at Sephora, and save for one product (Dr. Gross 2 step pad) that somewhat helped with my adult rosacea, this has been life changing...I don&#x27;t have to wear cover up!  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 38 year old with acne prone oily skin and spots. I&#x27;m one week into using this product at nights and loving it so far!! ❤️❤️👍🏽👍🏽 It strikes a good balance of moisturizing my skin and keeping spots under control.  I purchased after much research looking for ingredients to manage acne and yet moisturize . I think the Vit C, retinol, and salicyclic acid combo hits the spot!. I think this is a reasonable price for the value and I find many other products too heavy which in turn causes bumps. Instanatural, thank you soooo much!!!!! And can we get a bigger bottle? 😄</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 1/2 months and I&#x27;m not experiencing so many breakouts and if I have something, it clears pretty quickly.  I&#x27;m almost 50 and since hitting my 40s have been struggling with breakouts &amp; keeping my skin hydrated.  Love this brand as it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either.  I have also seen my pores shrink.</li>
    <li> I have been using the whole bottle of this already but I don&#x27;t feel like my skin show improvement with this serum.  To my personal, vitamin A just never really help me that much compare to vitamin C.  The vitamin C serum of this line is much better for me.  This serum makes me have some bump and clog my pores.  It just not working for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face everyday for a week now. I have had acne since I was 12, nothing has ever cleared it up or improved my skin. After a week of using this, I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference. My skin is still breaking out and my pores are still large. Smells like tanning lotion when it dries but fades quickly. Maybe it needs longer time to show any difference.. :/</li>
    <li> Put it on the break out spot on my chest now the whole area is discolored and peeling in multiple layers , never had a bad reaction to any meds ever , now looks like I got a cigarette burnt sport on my chest</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now, so far I like it. I hope I could get a little improvement after a month of using this product in my skin, if yes, maybe I would buy another bottle and keep all you guys posted.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- I wish it&#x27;s a pump bottle and big bottle in the same price. :)</li>
    <li> It seemed to be working it&#x27;s magic for a month or so. But now I&#x27;m not so sure. Will give it a couple more weeks, maybe my review will change then.</li>
    <li> My face does seem to have a softer look.  After continued use I&#x27;m hoping for more improvement.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum!  Non-irritating for my sensitive skin and gives it a nice even appearance.  Gets rid of redness too.  The seller has superb customer service and great communication.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> In love with this product!!! Firmer skin, tougher skin, and has helps keep acne away. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed my wrinkles are vanishing.  I like how it brightens my face giving me a nice glow. I can&#x27;t say enough. I like that&#x27;s it&#x27;s natural ingredients. ..that&#x27;s important for me.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Been using this for a few weeks. Definitely noticing clearer pores, it will take awhile to see results on dark spots!</li>
    <li> I always make sure to keep one extra in case I run out. Works great for my sensitive skin... I get minor acne here and there on my forehead due to oily skin but this thing helps ALOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/2/2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to drop the rating from 5 stars to 3 because I noticed that the formula is not longer the same. It&#x27;s less effective in my opinion because I noticed that I started having small breakouts and it took alot longer for this to work than before.</li>
    <li> First of all, I paid for this product.  I am 45 and have been dealing with some adult acne for several years.  I started using this product 3 weeks ago. I was expecting to break out more initially, as usually happens for me with a new product, and the first two days this was true.  However, the acne healed very quickly, and I have not broken out at all since. It&#x27;s a little early to evaluate how this product works for anti-aging, as such changes happen over months if at all, but my skin looks smooth and happy, and I am thrilled.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.....i like that it&#x27;s natural. In the short time i have used it, it has softened out the fine lines around my eyes. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Skin has cleared up. This is my second order.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and texture and what it does for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product. I really really like it. I do believe it makes my skin heal faster after a break out which I unfortunately get often :( It also smells nice and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Just Amazing! cleared acne marks in 3 days I&#x27;ve been trying to fade for 4 weeks! Need this formulation in hand n body lotion!</li>
    <li> My skin was in a mess and I had tried just about everything before I took a gamble on this product. Acne, oiliness, sagging skin and marks defined my face.  I was suprised at how quickly this product worked - it really made my skin age backwards. My acne scars and age spots faded while my skin and overall complexion looks more plump and glowing. Everyone is complementing my face these days. Once my skin cleared up I only need to use it about twice a week. This is my new secret weapon. Great product!</li>
    <li> I like it so far...may have to buy another bottle soon!</li>
    <li> Expected more from product. I may try the one by Radha. Not sure if results will be the same.</li>
    <li> Sorry, just didn&#x27;t work for me. My face still breaks out and the serum leaves a greasy residue on my face. I will go back to the serum with the pink label because I was able to see changes with that. Maybe this one just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin type :(</li>
    <li> I am biracial black/white and I get dark purple hyperpigmentation after I get a pimple. I have used everything to try to get rid of them. Nothing has worked very well. You can see the difference within 3 days. It&#x27;s been a week and my spots are 75% diminished. Best product ever!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have taken the time to write a review about a product in the internet. This is the best 22$ I have ever spent on any cosmetic product. It is a bang for the buck. Three days onto using this product and I can clearly see the results in my face. I think it works for everything including blemishes, whitehead, blackhead, acne, and dark circle. I have been using it twice once in the morning and once before bed. slight burning sensation but goes away in a minute or two. overall I am very happy to use this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, have very few wrinkles and am told that a have nice complection.  However, I was hoping that this serum would brighten my skin and remove the dark spots from years of sun damage.  When I saw that this product contains all the buzz words....vitamin C,  Hyaluronic acid, retinol and Salicylic acid.....and all the good reviews, I believed that it could help me. Regrettably, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change although I&#x27;ve used it everyday for a month along with argan oil.  I used up all of it &amp; don&#x27;t know if I will reorder.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It eliminates lines after one use. used regularly really takes ten years off.</li>
    <li> miracle in a bottle. WOW! The texture of my skin only after a week has improved so much! Recommend</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the positive effects I have noticed from this serum. My fine lines softened and I noticed an allover tightening of my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME. I was having skin issues like wrinkles, breakouts and discoloration.  This serum has started to help ALL of those issues.  When I put this stuff on my skin glows and feels great too.  I highly recommend.  I will definitely be reordering.  I have ordered a few other products from this line that are really great as well.</li>
    <li> I love this Skin Clearing serum! It smells so great and works like a charm! My breakout was noticeably less red and practically vanished over night! The vitamins and nutrients give my skin a great glow! I can&#x27;t wait to try out the rest of the products from this company! I am hooked!</li>
    <li> The product is amazing and my skin has gotten softer and smoother within two weeks.I will be ordering more.  ExtExtremely pleased.</li>
    <li> Has a nice citrusy fragrance and is very light.  Absorbs well and has a nice tingle to it that makes me feel like its working.  Does not seem to dry my skin as long as I follow it with a moisturizer or sunblock afterwards.  I do think my skin is more clear and certainly FEELS better :)  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum twice a day for a few weeks now. I use a toner, then the serum, then a moisturizer. It has a nice smell and as long as you give it time to dry, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I have definitely seen an improvement in my overall complexion - my skin look brighter and smoother. My dark spots have faded a bit, but I think the results will be much more visible as I continue to use the product. Overall, the product is worth a try for the price and comparable to much more expensive products. Customer service is great - I received an email shortly after purchasing with directions on how to best utilize the product, and I also received a follow up email to make sure the product was satisfactory. There&#x27;s definitely something to be said for a company that truly cares for its customers! I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase with InstaNatural.  The Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum works great for my skin and I plan on purchasing this again and trying their other products.  During the first week, I used the product once a day.  It is not thick or greasy and my skin instantly looked healthy.  My skin was noticeable firmer after each use.  My skin was slightly dry before use so I made sure to apply just a little coconut oil each day.  It has been several weeks now and the difference is so noticeable that I&#x27;ve actually switched to a much lighter foundation in the mornings.  My skin looks and feels healthier and younger!  It did clean out a few pores which caused a couple of blemishes  and within a week they were healed and no longer noticeable.  The serum did not cause new break out and my pores are clear now.  No other product has done that for me!  Give it a week for your skin to adjust but you&#x27;ll see the difference within a day or so!!  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is not what I was expecting, but the company is great. I gave it a try and it did not work out, and I was able to return it for a full refund with no questions asked. This product is definitely a skin clearing product. It has some very powerful salicylic acid in it. I was expecting something more along the lines of refining and toning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 3 weeks now, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due more to the serum or the fact that I&#x27;ve completely given up sugar and most dairy, but the acne aligning my forehead and chin has almost cleared! The serum definitely adds a youthful glow to my skin though.  I also enjoy the citrusy smell.  Unfortunately my toddler dumped out the entire bottle this morning, but I will for sure reorder!</li>
    <li> This serum smells good and does it job. I&#x27;m very pleased with what&#x27;s it&#x27;s done with my face.</li>
    <li> I am 63 years old and am using this product twice a day.  My skin is firmer, the lines are diminished and my face has a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it.  For being an over the counter product, it is a good product.  Also, did not experience any irritation at all.</li>
    <li> Good product. Clarifies my skin and gives a glow. A little goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for apx 6 weeks and have seen a big difference in my skin - fewer noticeable wrinkles and a clearer and healthier glow. I would certainly recommend it for anyone to try for themselves.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff! Using Retinol Serum, Vit. C Serum, Retinol Moisturizer, Vit. C Moisturizer, Age Defying Moisturizer and Eye Cream.  I interchanged these every two or three days and am seeing softer, smoother skin.  I&#x27;ve been using these for over a month now.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying my Instanatural serums (more so than their creams/lotions - except the coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this one primarily around my eyes and I do feel that, over the past two or so months since I started, I look a little fresher in the morning. My crow&#x27;s feet aren&#x27;t gone, of course, but the tone seems more even and I feel I look more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely scent and glides on very  nicely. I apply in the morning after I wash my face, and put Weleda skin food over it. It does have an orange tint, beware, so you do have to make sure it&#x27;s rubbed in. This product coupled with their other Vit C serum has definitely seen a reduction in how often I use my BB cream!</li>
    <li> I am very please with your product. I have been using it for 3 weeks and I see better results on my face. I&#x27;m using it for reducing acne and to clear scars. It either eliminates a pimple before it occurs or makes it come out easy without any pain. I love that it&#x27;s natural and had a great citrus smell and when I apply a few drops on my face in neck I love that it absorbs into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily mess on my face. It can be used twice a day but I just use it once,before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> I love the citrus smell, and my skin looks revitalized and feels great. I enjoy putting it on every morning.  I&#x27;ve tried every designer product and this exceeds all of them.  My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> My skin has cleared up and the tone and texture is improving.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Great product! I would definitely buy this again in the future!</li>
    <li> I am 21 years old, and have always suffered from oily, acne prone skin. My face had cleared up for the most part this spring, but all of a sudden in July I got the most terrible hormonal acne breakout of my life. I know it was hormonal because it was all on my jawline. It&#x27;s very upsetting to be entering adulthood with what I would consider a pizza face, since I also had some red marks on my cheeks as well. This acne was different than any acne I had as a teen as no matter how often I used typically reliable face washes and such that had worked over the years, the bumps wouldn&#x27;t budge. I ended up doing a lot of research and decided the less chemicals the better, but still needed that one great adult acne fighting ingredient. Long story short retinol is where it&#x27;s at, not only for anti-aging but for adult acne as well. Retinol essentially removes thin layers of your skin (slowly and not too harshly) promoting all of those impurities to be raised to you skin&#x27;s surface for treatment.&lt;br /&gt;That being said all of the ingredients in this product, but I credit mainly the retinol, have led to about a 90% reduction in the severe summer breakout that was terrorizing me! The retinol encouraged me to exfoliate those layers of skin coming off, and the salicylic acid then treats the blemishes brought up to the surface. The vitamin c also has a pleasing smell, and I believe has helped improve the overall texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> Wow.  This is the first face product I&#x27;ve used that I could feel working immediately.  My face tingled, felt tighter - and the lovely citrus smell reminds me of baby aspirin.  I also like that the serum is dispensed via a dropper onto my fingertips, meaning less waste than with a pump.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. This is a wonderful miracle in a little blue bottle. My skin has never been happier than it is using this stuff - it just drinks it up and begs for more. I use this once or twice a day (depending on how rushed I am in the morning) and it&#x27;s wonderful. I bought this on a whim, looking for something extra to amp up my facial care routine... and this is it. Definitely interested in trying some other things from this company!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars only because I&#x27;m still evaluation the results. But my skin does look brighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old and I still have breakouts. This was recommended to me by a friend. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I am noticing the difference already. Yes at first my face did peel for the first week, but after that, I experience less oil and my pores appear smaller now.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It leaves my skin refreshed and bright.  It has a wonderful smell.  It&#x27;s perfect for my 30s skin, which needs wrinkle protection but to also be an acne fighter.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> This serum really gets the job done its as simple as cleanse, put on the serum , and moisturize it dries pimples instantly got a more even skin tone WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum along with a dermaroller for about the last two weeks (serum either once or twice a day, roller two times a week) and I&#x27;ve started to see an improvement in the hyper pigmentation and scars I have.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed an improvement for current blemishes but nothing topical has ever worked for them and they are small and far between.  This serum smells great and absorbs really quickly!  It leave a nive matte finish to your skin after applying.  Also the customer service along with this product is amazing!  They sent me an email making sure I was 100% satisfied with my purchase and offered me a full refund if I was not.  This is definitely worth the money and from what I can tell, it lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a 3 weeks and can definitely see results. I have hormonal acne breakouts every month and so far this is the first product that has really cleared my skin. I have been using it twice a day and I have experienced any dryness. I have tried Proactiv and AcneFree in the past few months and this has cleared my skin better than either of those. My entire complexion is also brighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vitamin C serum for about a month now. And it&#x27;s working quite well on my sensitive skin. I like it with tea tree oil to soothe the irritated skin. It&#x27;s more like all in one kind of skin serum, not only take care of the nutritious to the skin but also calms the damage and repair the skin. Love this serum! Great Product!</li>
    <li> I am in my late teens, and bought this for my acne-riddled skin upon reading of the stellar reviews, and let me tell you, they are true. After three weeks of use, my face has cleared up to almost no acne. I use it before bed on my skin that has gone through the wear and tear of the day, and I wake up with new skin basically. The price is not cheap, but it is a good investment, if you are like me, and fed up with acne.</li>
    <li> So far so good....I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3-4 weeks. It&#x27;s very non-irritating and a little goes a long way.My skin is very smooth and healthy looking. I am hopeful that it will diminish a fairly large sun spot that I have on my cheek.....perhaps over time. I would by again!</li>
    <li> It gave me zits on my face after usage. I have tried vitamin C based products on my face before and usually that&#x27;s always the case. So the only reason I&#x27;m giving it a two stars is because I&#x27;m allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about this because I gave it to the wife&#x27;</li>
    <li> Reviews are all fake and paid. I don&#x27;t recommend. Smell is very strong and product does nothing. You&#x27;re better off buying a bottle of tea tree oil, and some salycidic acid gel from target. That combo works much better. Save yourlsef the troule. This is oily and useless.</li>
    <li> My skin overall looks clearer and more healthy (less red and with fewer breakouts), is softer and maintains its moisture better. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This serum has a nice clean citrusy scent.  My pores look tighter and my sunspots have lightened...they have not disappeared, but definitely have lightened. I use very little foundation now.  I am very satisfied with InstaNatural products.  I have not been disappointed with any of their products.  I use their Rosehip Seed oil over the serum as a moisturizer.  I let it soak in while I&#x27;m doing my hair, then I finish putting my makeup on...again, I am not using as much foundation.  Just remember, a little goes a long way...about the size of a small pea (or lentil).</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have definitely noticed a positive change in my face. It seems more even toned wrinkles have diminished blemishes Gone! I love this product.  I apply day and night after I shower in the morning and before I go to bed at night.</li>
    <li> I love it! My face is covered with pimple scars and dark spots. I think this product lightens those dark imperfections.</li>
    <li> I would like a longer time to use it before doing a review.  I do like that it&#x27;s affordable.  You haven&#x27;t put all your efforts into a fancy delivery system that jacks the price way up.  I also like the light orange scent.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> OMG this is the most amazing facial product I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very very oily skin. Within an hour you can practically see the giant globs of oil coming from my pores. So with that, of course, comes the acne. Really bad acne. Plus, I have the wonderful scars from my pickin&#x27; days. I&#x27;m in my 30s now, so I was getting darker spots that leave little red marks when they&#x27;re &amp;#34;healed&amp;#34;. I&#x27;d get cystic acne and it went down mid neck, and it re-occurred. I was miserable so I searched for some hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything under the sun. Murad, ProActive, Neutrogena, Dr. Brandt, a bunch more hoity toity brands, and all led to the same conclusion. So I turned to Amazon and found InstaNatural. Based on the good reviews I first ordered this: http://smile.amazon.com/InstaNatural-Anti-Aging-Facial-Moisturizer-Cream/dp/B00KCTER3U/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_194_23?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1T4ADEY4P26PBRX2VPAY. Unfortunately, this InstaNatural cream broke me out horribly! Bad cystic acne. I gave it a couple of months too. But it was bad. To InstaNatural&#x27;s credit, they stick by their guarantee. They gave me my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found this stuff and no joke within 2 days my face was 50% better. I used it twice a day. At night only the serum. Nothing else (I usually do the serum and a lotion). In the morning I use the serum and Neutrogena Clear Face http://smile.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Clear-Sunblock-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B004D2C5FY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1435723257&amp;sr&#x3D;1-7&amp;keywords&#x3D;neutrogena+sunscreen and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week you&#x27;ll see some peeling and maybe some random breakouts (maybe even a cyst or two, don&#x27;t freak out) while this is working all the nasty out of your skin. A couple of weeks later you&#x27;re looking at 75%. In less than a month, my face was healed! No acne! The little red bumps went away. The cysts went away. And my face although still oily, is LESS oily. And the plus? Well reduced fine lines (no not gone, reduced), some plumping AND tightening of my skin, and a really nice glow! I love love love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But BE WARNED. This stuff has retinol so your face will be a lot more sensitive to sun. The Neutrogena sunblock is great, but wear a hat if you&#x27;re going to be hanging out in the sun for while. You can get burned REALLY easily. I learned my lesson. But hey, guess what? This stuff got those red marks out within a week.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months and the changes have been pretty significant. My skin looks so much better! I have to buy this stuff in bulk it is amazing!</li>
    <li> The secret to all of these products is to use them faithfully. Once you stop for any length of time you will see your wrinkles and loose skin return. What I love about this product is that it does not make my skin oily and does not create acne like some of the others. I do recommend this product if you have oily skin or are acne prone.</li>
    <li> I put this on the backs of my hands every night before bed. In just two days I started to notice differences. After a week, my hands look firmer, smoother, and clearer. No more crepe paper hands for me! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Really helped my problem skin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Does exactly what it claims.</li>
    <li> Love thus stuff.  Great smell. Does not leave my face red line other products has in the past.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, great ingredients. Good for both aging and acne. I use it with InstaNatural&#x27;s Retinol Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Not for acne. I bought this after reading the raving reviews and researching the amazing properties of Vitamin C. Not only does this have Vitamin C, but it also contains lots of other ingredients such as retinol and salicylic acid, which is good for acne. Seeing the ingredients and also because this is advertised as &amp;#34;skin clearing&amp;#34; I bought this in hopes of either my skin clearing up a bit or lighten blemishes or make my skin less dull (which is why Vita C is known for). But I didn&#x27;t get any difference at all. I almost used up the bottle (1 and 1/2 month). Nothing happened to me. Rather, the serum was sticky and uncomfortable. THIS IS NOT FOR TEEN/STRESS ACNE. Maybe it works for older people but I don&#x27;t like the false advertisement- almost as if this is the a magical potion with all power ingredients and usable for everyone from teens(skin clearing) and older people (age defying) as the name is called &amp;#34;age defying and skin clearing serum&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Yahoo, love this product...  Something that finally works...  Lots of damage (67 yrs young) to correct, but see differences in just over a week.  Looking forward to better skin with use.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff-don&#x27;t know exactly how this combination of ingredients work so well together but it definitely DOES work wonders.  Clears up skin imperfections and dark spots almost immediately</li>
    <li> I really love this product. recently I have started looking after my skin. I use Pevonia cleansing wash, then blackhead remover by Johnson THEN this serum and then ROC retinol cream. the combination is great :-) I love the scent of this serum and how it sinks in naturally and tightens pores and wrinkles. I really enjoy using this and have re-ordered it as why fix something that aint broke ;-)</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff is really amazing, I&#x27;v only been using it for 4 days and my skin is already clear! I have used so many products and nothing has worked besides this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy, will be looking forward to trying more instanatural products!</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this as it contains all great skincare ingredients. However this broke me out horribly. Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This serum works much better than expected. I&#x27;ve noticed Sun spots lightening better than expensive creams. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I was provided this product for an honest review. This product is more suited for oily skin. Too drying for my combo skin (oily T-zone/dry cheeks and chin). I used this as a spot treatment and it worked ok. Didn&#x27;t clear spots any quicker than a normal spot treat product.</li>
    <li> So i followed the instructions to a t but it still makes my cheeks red and blotchy every time i use it and even with a moisturizer i have flakey skin every morning.  I know that its this product causing it because i never had dry skin prior to this and nothing else has changed. In fact,  my skin used to be pretty oily and this has dried me up...and not in a good way.  I even tried just using it at night and it still has the same effect. :( waste of twenty bucks!</li>
    <li> This product is good. You need a little more then they suggest do it may go a bit fast. I can say the customer service exceeded my expectations!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I see the difference. Feels great on my skin. Will buy again. This is my new serum.</li>
    <li> I am soo in love with this Vitamin C serum!! It works wonders, I swear! I had a few spots of acne on my face, I applied this at night after washing my face like I normally would, and by the morning everything looked soooo much better and even cleared up a tad, definitely less red! This stuff also smells amazing! Like oranges, as it should! :) I was given this product for testing purposes, but these are my honest opinions!</li>
    <li> Okay, this is the second retinol product that I&#x27;ve used by InstaNatural, and I think this one if my favorite. As I&#x27;ve mentioned in another Instanatural review, I love how their retinol products do not make my skin hurt, yet they work. My skin tone has evened out so much in a month, but this product has helped clear my acne AND it smells like citrus. Instanatural adds high quality essential oils, so your skin feels supply and moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me for review purposes, as usual, I give an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the citric smell and it observes well into my skin. However, after using this for a month I asked for a return because it was not helping my blemishes. The company was very understanding and gave me a refund. They also advice me that I had to use it for 2 months to see the results so I continued on. Now, after almost 2 months of use I can see my blemishes have lightened. I owe the company apologies!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I love that its light, absorbs quickly into my skin and has a pleasant smell and a little product goes a long way. After about the first week I noticed my skin looking brighter, smoother and healthier. My pores were less visible. I think its too early to tell if it will help clear up my existing acne scars but with continued use I am hoping to see some improvement. I have acne prone, sensitive skin and this product has not broken me out plus its affordable and the results so far outweigh those of expensive creams and serums I have purchased in the past. I will repurchase and am looking at other products in this line.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product. They&#x27;ve change the formulation to include retinol and salicylic acid. If you have hyperpigmentation or age spots on your face this product really works. You must bear in mind that it takes time. It took four months for my age spots to fade. But they are gone! One thing I love about this product is all the effective ingredients all in one serum. You don&#x27;t have to go purchase all the different ingredients separately.</li>
    <li>  I am so happy that after much research I was finally able to find products that do not bother my extremely sensitive skin and actually work. </li>
    <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly and has a light citrus smell. This serum is really pleasant to use!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!!!! I can&#x27;t express how hopeless I thought my skin was. I had large pores (that I tried shrinking with everything under the sun, including witch hazel) sun spots, &amp; uneven skin tone. In just one week I noticed a difference in my skin. I will definetly be buying more from this company.</li>
    <li> Vitamin c!!! I apply it every morning to protect my skin from sun!</li>
    <li> Love this product &amp; line! It is a very high quality Serum...It has improved my skin in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;I really Love the items from this company! It is a nice sized bottle too..</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has really helped keep my skin clear and helps to fade leftover red marks from ingrown hair bumps. I got through my younger years with great skin to get to the meno years with skin issues. This has really helped my skin issues.I even have a second bottle as a back up.</li>
    <li> So far my skin and neck are breaking out more since I have used this. Not happy and will try and return it. My skin looks awful :(</li>
    <li> The black points in my face are fadeout</li>
    <li> If you have issues with your skin and have sensitive or dry skin that breaks out, BUY this product, I promise you this will change your skin. I am of Irish decent and have very sensitive skin and am often times scared to try a new product. My skin cleared up and there was no harsh drying!</li>
    <li> I really like this, it has smoothed my skin and really alleviated the random breakouts I have from time to time. A pinch goes a long way. I use this in conjunction with the Avalon Organics line that can be found at Wal-Mart. They really work well together to me.</li>
    <li> Love love it!!! No pimples, no dry skin anymore. Best skin in years!</li>
    <li> I do not use this daily but think it will be really good during winter weather.</li>
    <li> This stuff made me breakout :( I wish that I could give as great of reviews as everyone else but it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin. I know the retinol is supposed to make you break out at first as it bring everything to the surface, so I kept using it until for about 3 months and it just got worse and worse. A few days after I stopped using this my skin stopped breaking out so I&#x27;m sure this is what was causing it. It&#x27;s a shame because it made my skin soft where it wasn&#x27;t breaking out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the InstaNaturals products and the others that I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve liked so far. I had high hopes for this serum as it&#x27;s reviews are overwhelmingly positive; but sadly it failed me. I have combination acne prone skin. I tried this product on more than one occasion and it ended up breaking me out in cystic acne both times. I was hoping the first time it was due to stress, but sadly it looks like this is the culprit. Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck with one of their other serums.</li>
    <li> this stuff made me breakout :(! My skin feels very itchy after applying them on</li>
    <li> Great product and awesome delivery time.</li>
    <li> I love it. I went back and bought more. I think it really has made a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> I had 2 hyper-pigmentation marks from pimples on my face that wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what fade cream I used. I bought this and put this on my face in the morning with sunblock, and at night. A month later the marks are barely visible. I gifted it to my friend who has bacne and her back is almost completely cleared of both pimples and dark spots. It takes time and a proper skin care regime, but this product works. Throw away all hydroquinone products that are bad for you and use this!</li>
    <li> Awesome serum, its just gets absorbed in the skin and you can see the results the product claims, highly recomended</li>
    <li> What I love about InstaNatural&#x27;s Skin Clearing Serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The benefits of the 20% concentration of Vitamin C are wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The smell of this serum is quite pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is very effective at clearing my acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I love the high quality of this serum!</li>
    <li> I added this in as part of my regular beauty routine, and am very happy with the results. I have smoother, clearer skin, a more even tone, and a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> Very nice...I mix it with my moisturizer and love it!</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with Insta natural&#x27;s Retinol Facial Moisturizer and love the results I&#x27;ve been having. My fine lines are less noticable, and the ingredients are all natural.</li>
    <li> This product is working great for my 17 year old as well as me...</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both are using it. She is seeing good results for her acne which she has struggled with. I got it for the lines around my eyes and mouth. It appears to be working and my skin is certainly softer and younger feeling.</li>
    <li> Most serums I have used in the past were heavy and/or sticky.  This one goes on very smoothly and absorbs instantly.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but can already see some subtle results.</li>
    <li> I used it for acne treatment. It does work for dark acne mark. But when I applied more on my face, I have allergic reaction and I have more breakouts..</li>
    <li> This is very effective to me and my husband! We both love it!</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying out a serum and I have been thrilled with the results! I love how quickly this combats redness and breakouts. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles (thankfully!) so I&#x27;m not sure how it works on that. Tea tree oil is in the ingredients, and it&#x27;s one of my favorite oils to use on my face so I was excited to see that! It has a citrus-y scent which I find refreshing.</li>
    <li> Id say this serum is just ok. It smells awsome but really didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have redness, but sometimes I have a little acne. I don&#x27;t feel any dramatic change on my skin, but it is good I think.&lt;br /&gt;This product works okay for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product religiously  (twice daily) since purchase roughly 2 months ago with Zero improvement.  The percentage of retinol in the serum should cause peeling ( which helps in collagen production) but this product does not. I have used 2% retinol alone that has caused peeling as it should.  I will use until bottle is empty then update should any changes occur. As of now, there have been no changes in my fine lines/wrinkles. Don&#x27;t  waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works better than other serums I pay double for. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell much difference yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple of weeks. It has made my skin dry (which, I understand, is part of the &amp;#34;process&amp;#34; as skin sheds old cells). I do see a slight difference in my overall skin tone and brown spots so I will finish the bottle, then decide. Seller has been very helpful--had a small problem and it was remedied immediately.</li>
    <li> I love using this serum on my face. It makes it feel very moisturized.</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients in this product.....it does everything from calming irritated skin, treating acne plus reducing wrinkles.....am happy with this product and glad to have come across it. Thankyou instanatural for such wonderful products:)</li>
    <li> This multitasking serum has exceeded my expectations! It treats my monthly acne breakouts while also providing anti aging protection. I was shocked at how well this worked. I use it daily whether I have breakouts or not, not just on my face but on my chest and neck. I only wish they offered this in a 4oz bottle!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, like  the  serum, only  need  a small  amount, really  helped the look of skin on my neck,  more moisturized. Also  brown  spots on my  face  are getting lighter. Thanks</li>
    <li> I like how it&#x27;s a thin type of liquid. Went on smooth and absorbed very quick. Once fully applied to my face and neck .. it was like nothing but I could feel the difference. My skin looks healthier and more natural. I apply 2 times a day (morning and night) and I notice how my skin is becoming more youthful and clear. Honestly really liked this product. I RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> This stuff is literally magic. I&#x27;ve had moderate to severe acne for around 5 years along with very dry sensitive skin. I could never find something that got rid of pimples but didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. At first the serum did what every other product has and made my face red, dry and flakey. I was extremely disappointed but a few days later after my skin was back to normal I decided to try it again. I started by just adding in one drop at night and mixing with moisturizer. I&#x27;m now using 2 drops applied directly to my problem areas (nose and chin) and 2 more drops to a pump of moisturizer that I apply all over. I can honestly say my skin has never been clearer! It&#x27;s brighter, more even and my acne scars are slowly disappearing. I&#x27;ll be using this serum for as long as it&#x27;s available, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for more than one week diligently and I could see immediately the change on my face.  My friends complemented the change on facial features.  In short, I am completely satisfied with the product purchased from Amazon.  I also recommended to all my friends about the product.</li>
    <li> I have used it on my hands and my spots are disappearing - really great stuff.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to think about this product. I applied it once a day at night, used very little and had a bad peeling reaction on my whole face! My face was so dry and red and stung so bad when I applied any type of lotion or foundation on my skin. I am now just using it on my acne bumps on the side of my face to see if I see a improvement . This is product is not intended for the whole face! I had Nasty dry patches and red ness like I got sun burn! I wish this would have come with instructions would have made a huge difference! This is very acidic and drying .. Be aware!!!! This is not moisterizing  product!!!  After using this product I broke out with a bad cystic pimple! it was horrible! i never tried such a bad product. Meanwhile I see people post 5 stars reviews every hour or two hours?!  I Hope people are not getting paid to post FAKE reviews on amazon!</li>
    <li> I used an anti-aging product called Nerium for 5 months and overtime it clogged my pores and made my skin break out badly around my chin.  I ordered this product hoping it would help clear up my skin and it did.  This serum along with some other great products and regular facials have almost completely cleared up my skin and I&#x27;m trilled.</li>
    <li> This serum is quite possibly the best thing that has ever happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever read my reviews, you know that I tell it how it is, good, bad, or indifferent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll review the product first, then talk about my results. I love the blue bottle. The orange label really pops against the bottle and makes it stand out. It has a dropper that is really easy to use and makes it easy to dispense the amount of serum you want without wasting any or making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a milky-yellow color. Its not really thick, but I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as thin either. Its in between. I love the scent of this serum. It has a citrus smell that resembles orange juice to me.The serum is easy to apply. You don&#x27;t need a lot and it goes on very smoothly. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or greasy, and it completely absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly haven&#x27;t ever had a product that worked so wonderfully for me before. I&#x27;ve always thought that skin care products worked differently for each person, and this serum is a perfect example of that. I&#x27;ve always seen few slight benefits with some products, I&#x27;ve never had any drastic results until this serum. After applying, I immediately noticed that my skin looked healthier and had a slight glow. Within 2 days, this serum cleared up my acne. After 2 weeks, I had a more even skin tone and my skin had a smoother texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m noticing that some fine lines are completely gone. The ones around my eyes (the beginnings of crows feet) are entirely gone, and the fine lines starting on my forehead are diminishing. I don&#x27;t know if the fine lines on my forehead will go away completely, but I&#x27;m going to keep using this to find out.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this serum enough. It is by far the most effective skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Totally changed the texture of my face and is fading my hyper pigmentation marks</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum has been wonderful to my skin. After using this product for some time now I notice my face is clearer and doesn&#x27;t break out like it used to. My skin also looks and feels healthier. It doesn&#x27;t get dry anymore and has a nice hydrated look. The dropper makes using it very easy I don&#x27;t need to worry about using too much. I bought this product to test how good is would be on my problematic skin and it did wonders. I love it and recommend it. It also has a nice pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I was most excited about this serum. In addition to being great for anti-aging and wrinkles, this product promises to help minimize pore size as well as even skin tone. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, but I have large pores on my nose and who doesn&#x27;t want a more even complexion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start by saying this has a very strong orange scent. I really like it but my husband does not. This serum is also very very thick. I&#x27;m used to using oils, and this is definitely not an oil. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but it was much thicker than I expected. However, it does apply easily to the skin and absorbs relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the products for a few weeks so I can&#x27;t do a real long term review (will do another one after I can use the products more), but I will say that my face felt amazingly soft after using this! I think my complexion looks brighter from use, but maybe I&#x27;ve just been happier about the sun finally coming out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few quick notes about the packaging: It comes in a large bottle, so it will last quite a while. It also comes with a dropper so you can easily control how much product you dispense. I hate bottles that you have to pour because I inevitably pour too much and therefore waste product. I was really happy with this packaging.</li>
    <li> Helps with acne. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This serum is great. Purchased specifically to help diminish severe dark spots left from a break out. Has worked wonders. Must be patient, but has tremendously helped.</li>
    <li> Good product, arrived on time!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me after using the entire bottle for almost a month. Don&#x27;t believe the hype as the ingredients are not verified. Most reviewrs must have gotten the product for free for an exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;Would never purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product left me feeling nice and smooth in under a weeks time.&lt;br /&gt;My face is starting to clear up from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you buy a brush to apply this with.</li>
    <li> This product meets my troubled skin needs for both breakouts AND anti-aging.  This serum is really light, whitish liquid that absorbs really quickly into the skin - a couple of drops is all you need because it is really liquid.  It has a faint smell of cirtrus, but just barely.  It is a powerful combination of Vitamin C, Retinol and Salicylic acid.  These are the top 3 ingredients in the product and also my personal top 3 for: lightening (C), smoothing (retinol) and clearing up skin (Salicylic acid).  Salicylic acid has always been my go-to for breakouts anyway, but it can be drying on its own.  Retinol is UV-sensitive, so I only use this product at night.  My skin feels smoother, more supple and tighter after application.  I would not say this is a super hydrating serum but for me I have combination skin so it balances both the dry and the oily without overdoing either. Most anti-aging serums I use leave a lot of oil behind, but not this.  If you have combination skin that is going through a phase between still breaking out and also beginning to wrinkle, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Instanatural serum for the last few weeks and I absolutely love it!!  Right from the first use, I noticed a &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; and smoothening of my complexion.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin tone is more even; some redness that sometimes appears on my cheeks and chin has diminished.  Oh, and all signs of winter dryness has been completely eliminated.  The serum is SUCH a great moisturizer, but without being too heavy.  It is just so perfectly light and luxurious.  I love how it feels going on.  And the smell is delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from friends/colleagues asking me what I&#x27;ve been doing lately, because I&#x27;ve just been glowing!  This product was worth every penny and I will continue to buy it for as long as Instanatural keeps making it!</li>
    <li> this product is truly awesome. I was so happy that i was picked for it, and I will be ordering more when i run out. You should really try this product for yourself there is a MANUFACTURER GUARANTEE - InstaNatural backs their products with a Lifetime Money Back Guarantee, no matter where you buy our product. If you&#x27;re not satisfied, simply contact us and get a full refund. You have nothing too loose!!</li>
    <li> InstaNatural has got to be one of my favorite brands when it comes to skin care products. I have tried quite a few of their products and I am never ever disappointed with the results that I get. I use this Vitamin Serum in the morning under an SPF moisturizer and makeup. At night, I use it under a moisturizing treatment. The results I get from it impresses me. It really does a great job in keeping my face hydrated and eradicating fine lines. I love the fact that my skin is visibly brighter and plumper because of this product. I don’t think I will ever stop using/repurchasing this serum. It truly is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Skin cleared up within a few days I was in shock. As close to instant gratification as it can get. Edit* I haven&#x27;t used this product in 2 weeks and I noticed a difference with my skin. This is my third time purchasing this product and I&#x27;ll never wait 2 weeks to purchase it again! It&#x27;s an amazing product and I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have older sun harmed skin.  This serum is helping with some of the marks and improving what has been weathered for so long.  I am a *horse girl* as my husband calls me with the *horse gene,* so I&#x27;m out in the weather constantly and the sun has taken its toll.  But, this serum is trying to help me.  My skin feels much softer and a couple of spots have disappeared so far.  I will buy Vitamin C Serum with Retinol in the future for sure.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle and ordered another. I like how this feels on my skin and my skin looks refreshed and blemish free. It&#x27;s so nice to put on at night and my skin feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> Although many compliment me on my face and it always being clear of acne, I can&#x27;t say the same story goes for my back. For some reason my back likes to break out a lot and it usually does depend on my diet. But now, my back has scars and even dark splotches. I got this to see if it would help even out my skin tone and heal the scars.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is pricey but it seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;I have my mom rub a few drops onto my back every night after a shower and she even commented how lovely it smells. Weeks pass and when she begins to rub some on my back, she noted that it looks improved. Hardly an acne or blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I do plan on repurchasing this once I finish this bottle I have. (I also put it on my face and under my eyes and it feels so refreshing after)</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of the Vitamin C serum w/Retinol - I use this in the morning and the Age-Defying Serum w/Retinol at night.  My skin looks good and it does not seem to break me out.  When I do get breakouts I can usually attribute it to sunscreen use and humidity.  I have tried three different Insta-Natural products and they are all good.  I will continue to use both serums on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service!!</li>
    <li> It made my face burn and peel!!!</li>
    <li> Ok so i had major break out before i got this thankfully this was just in time, ever have that hurry up come in when you need something like yesterday? well if the shipping got any faster it would have been the day before i even ordered and if that wasnt amazing enough just one single touch and over night the side of my face was completely clear i have never seen anything like this before never, it seem the products just keep getting better and better from this company! I not only tried it on myself thinking maybe it was just me but i also tried it on my neighbor and same thing happened her break out was gone completely gone over night! This is definitely a product that is perfect just the way it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I lifted this item off a family member&#x27;s Christmas list (I got myself one while buying one for them)... I think it may be the best face stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.  My complexion is brighter and clearer than ever before.  My skin is sensitive and I&#x27;m usually leery of trying new products, as so many products break my face out instead of clearing it up.  Nothing but good things to report after about three weeks usage... I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The customer service is very pleasant. Quick shipping. The product is doing a very good job. I use it for myself for the fine lines and I use it with my grandson for his adolescent acne breakouts. It works well with both.</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin is so much better since I I started using this product!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I was breaking out like crazy and this helped so much. I will definitely buy more of this product And recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this for the acne features, not aging. I get occasional pimples and like everyone, I can&#x27;t stand it. I usually use generic Benzoyl Peroxide 10% cream but that takes a day or two to work. I felt a pimple underneath my skin so I put a drop of this stuff on it. It tingled and was very light. It drips like water. My face was tingling, almost felt like burning but I went to bed and woke up and there was no pimple or bump!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still been less than 1 month since I started using it. Haven&#x27;t seen any drastic results as the other reviews said. Let&#x27;s hope I see them soon.</li>
    <li> My wife is using this and she loves it - she plans on using it regularly to help her baby boomer skin.  One minor issue, even with her reading glasses she can&#x27;t read the label instructions without a magnifying glass.  But she is very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> It worked in a day. o_o</li>
    <li> This is one of the best serum in the market with great natural ingredients.  I have a habit of reading label before I put anything n my face, no yucky please. This clears my adult acne during  pms. Also give my skin a nice glow. Would definitely bu again.  *I receive this product with a discount, but my opinion is unbias and honest.</li>
    <li> I am 35 years old with combination skin and still get breakouts and blackheads on my nose and chin.  This serum has improved my complexion immensely in a short time with less than one bottle. I use it in the morning ( the orange scent is so invigorating) and again before bed!  I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s not absurdly expensive and delivers excellent results!</li>
    <li> Greatly reduced my acne scars in about 1 1/2 weeks of use.  Loving it so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in my skin after using this product.  I am very pleased. I put it on prior to my makeup and it makes it look flawless.</li>
    <li> I have used this for nearly 2 months and I have noticed a distinct difference in the fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I use this serum in conjunction with the InstaNaturals Retinol serum and their phytoceramides. I am incredibly impressed with the collective results.</li>
    <li> Great product... really improved the texture of my skin and reduced the size of my pores.</li>
    <li> Not seeing no improvement on my face .</li>
    <li> Already even tone, smoothness, and firmness in about 3 weeks of use. Non-greasy. light, and leaves a nice radiant glow. Wears well under make-up, no irritation. Using both this and their eye gel. Love them both and will reorder more. I have adult acne prone skin (cystic and rosacea), thus oily and left with scars. I have a hard time using anything without breakouts and iritation. Happy to finally benefit from a serum!</li>
    <li> I have already tried a couple of InstaNatural products and they worked quite well with my skin so I was excited to try the Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum. I do not have any age related skin problems yet but I still want to offset them! I have tried quite a few other serums and though all help my skin look better this serum helped my skin look a lot brighter than it has been. This product contains 20% Vitamin C which helps repair damage skin and prevent future damage! My skin always feels super soft and I have been getting fewer blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that InstaNaturals products are Made in the U.S.A and are not tested on animals! They also offer a full refund if you are not satisfied with their products so there is not reason in my opinion not to at least try their product!</li>
    <li> i use this everyday and my face looks amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, the Vit C moisturizer and the Vit C serum for about a month now.  Not only can I tell a difference so can other people as they&#x27;ve complimented me on my skin or asked what I&#x27;ve been doing different.  For what it is, it&#x27;s cheap compared to other products with the same ingredients.  I wrote a lengthy detailed review of all 3 on the eye serum...check it out.  And I did NOT receive this for free or at any discount.  I bought it out right and would do it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much my review is going to sound like I&#x27;m a paid customer.  I have always believed that beauty products should disclosed the percentage of the key ingredients, so I love that they tell you everything up front.  I had a noticeable difference in skin tone and appearance after the first use, and had been going through a bad skin period, with the primary complaint being I&#x27;m pushing 50.  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use my overall skin tone improved dramatically, pores appear less defined, and skin seems much more moisturized in a way that creams weren&#x27;t accomplishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
    <li> Did not see any result it claims, but drying out my skin. I still have half bottle left, but I do not have the courage to continue using on my face. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for 3 days and can already see a difference, my skin tone looks much more even and it even helped to clear up a zit that was emerging. I use it on my face before bed every night. It feels a bit greasy at first but quickly soaks into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it looking shiny or feeling oily - you could definitely still apply makeup after letting it dry if you were to put it on in the morning. Smell is subtle but refreshing, a bit like oranges - my boyfriend keeps telling me that my face smells good! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product after reading so many positive reviews. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t react so well with my skin. As soon as I dabbed on the tiniest amount, I got bumps over my face and my skin was slightly burning. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, not greasy, smooth</li>
    <li> I started using this product but did not give it enough time to see results yet. I will begin to use it again and update the review. Was nicely packaged and I did not have a reaction to any of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> this product don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Made my face congested and flaky right away, and considerably worsened the mild breakout I had. After the fifth application I observed the situation with a magnifying mirror and could actually see my pores clogging minute by minute.</li>
    <li> Great product and terrific customer service!</li>
    <li> This helps my sensitive, acne skin tremendously. Reduces my pimples and smooths my skin. I don&#x27;t think I ever need any other acne product.</li>
    <li> I used this vitamin c serum on my aunt to even her skin time and reduce the fine lines around her eyes, because she&#x27;s always piling makeup on to cover her sun spots and crows eyes is what she calls them.  She loved this vitamin c serum she noticed a difference in like 3 days. It made her skin so soft and it tighten it up some also. I didn&#x27;t take all of her wrinkles away, but with her new toned skin you can barely notice the lines around her eyes. So now she&#x27; a told all of her friends and they want to order some to try!! This was a free product for reviewing purposes!</li>
    <li> This is drastically helped improve the coloration in my face. I am so pleased with the results, my face is soft, smooth, and clear! No red spots from acne! It is not greasy, the serum easily spreads, and absorbs into your skin very well. No funky smells either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*complementary product received for review*</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! I&#x27;m forty-nine, with a few age appropriate lines  around my eyes and mouth. My skin is combination, and with winter here was dry, dull looking, and actually beginning to sag, so I had high hopes for this stuff. I apply it morning and night along with my usual regimen. The first couple of days it caused a tingling, almost burning feeling in certain areas and I was afraid that I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to use it, but continued for a couple more days. That&#x27;s when I noticed that my skin was sloughing off, mainly in the areas around my mouth and eyes. At this point my skin also felt rough, looked rather terrible, wrinkles and all. I was quite dismayed, and this is probably when someone would give up, declaring the serum to be terrible. I got after it with my trusty skin care brush, and after banishing all that flaky skin, my face is soft, more supple, and continuing to improve every day. With regular use of instanatural serum I&#x27;m seeing less lines and firmer skin every day. It has also seemed to purge my skin of clogged pours and gives it a healthy glow. It has been two weeks since I began using this serum. It doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle any more. My daughter has also used it to clear acne and it made a huge difference overnight. Again,amazing product. Thank you instanatural.   Richards wife.</li>
    <li> Bought the product for my son show has acme scaring.  He has been using it for about 3 weeks now and it controls his acme and seems to be lightening the scaring too!  Only takes a few drops each use, so bottle will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> So far it has been nice. No radical changes etc but works fine on my sensitive skin. I like that it comes with a dropper. That helps control the amount I use each time and it is cleaner that way too (especially a necessity for those with sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;Likely to buy again.</li>
    <li> This serum of Instanatural is perfect if you have oily skin and want to use salicylic acid. I only use 3 drops for all my face. It absorbs quickly. I use this serum twice a day. It works perfect with makeup, my foundation looks beautiful because my skin is moisturized and not oily at all. I think that it is better to use this serum and then a cream with salicylic acid for an intense treatment. All the ingredients in this bottle help to prevent acne and wrinkles at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum works much better than many creams, it does not dry the skin at all and maintains my skin free of blemishes and acne. I highly recommend you to try it.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
    <li> I used skinceuticals for about two years but my skin must of gotten immune to it as I didn&#x27;t subside my acne like it used to so I went into Amazon if there was a better alternative to substitute my acne treatment and came across this serum.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and the results are amazing!  I haven&#x27;t had a cystic acne Pop up since and my skin texture has improved.  So glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> just got the product yesterday and absoluty love lt! it actually sinks into my skin&lt;br /&gt;where other products do not. i cannot tell you what a difference i saw in just&lt;br /&gt;12 hours/ my skin looks beautiful! my husband noticed and now he wants to use it&lt;br /&gt;too! this is for sure a 5 star product!  the price is right too. keep up the great&lt;br /&gt;work amazon and instanatural and god bless.  LOVE MARY FISHER RN.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. My skin feels great and much smoother plus breakouts have disappeared from my menopausal skin.. Will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I was given the chance to try out the Anti-aging skin clearing serum and tell you what I think of it. I haven&#x27;t really had any problems with fine lines or crows feet or anything like that, but I do love to use and try out new products to help prolong my getting any of that. I really did love the way that the serum felt on my face. I made it soft and very smooth. The serum is a nice texture and not think at all which I really like. I hate the products that are too thick or that are watery as I don&#x27;t feel like they are really working. I would recommend the product to anyone looking for a all natural anti aging serum as it is great</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! It leaves your skin feeling radiant. This serum is great this time of year, it helps keep the dryness from artificial heater from ruining your complexion.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff, and far more affordable than other fancy skin products. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I can already see dramatic improvements! My face is smoother, clearer, and tighter. I&#x27;ve has these funny little pouches under my eyes my whole life, and I realized yesterday that they&#x27;re starting to go away-which I hadn&#x27;t been expecting at all, so I&#x27;m thrilled! My jawline also seems tighter, and the sun damaged look of the skin on my neck and chest is improving. The cleavage wrinkles on my chest from sleeping on my side are even smoothing out. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this-my mind is a little bit blown by how effective it&#x27;s been after such a short time.</li>
    <li> This serum does what it says it clears.  Helped get rid of acne for me.</li>
    <li> This serum works, but please be careful with use, I over exfoliated my skin .</li>
    <li> Follow up review. Over 1 year later. Still my favorite product on the market! At 42 I am very picky about what I put on my face. With instanaturals age defying serum, my skin is always clear! You can see my before pics from last year on my Instagram @atribecalledwhitlock.</li>
    <li> I could not use this,it burned my skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help me...made my skin much worse! Breakouts on my forehead, neck. Pretty bad. Stopped using after 1 week.</li>
    <li> This product is truly the best thing I have ever used on my skin!  I have been at that stage for a while where I am experiencing signs of aging, yet still have breakouts.  When I tried to treat the fine lines/aging signs, I would tend to break out because the product was too rich.  When I tried to control my acne with another product, It would dry out my skin too much and make it dull and accentuate my fine lines.  This serum is perfect!  It faded red spots that I had from previous breakouts pretty quickly.  Then my acne improved and now my skin has cleared up completely.  Finally, I started noticing my fine lines becoming less pronounced.  My skin looks better than it has in years.  I also like the fact that I can put it on in the morning and still use makeup on top of it if I choose.  Other serums and creams I tried before would not absorb into the skin and there was a sticky, tacky feeling and I could not use anything else over it.  I cannot recommend this serum highly enough!</li>
    <li> Love it already see differance</li>
    <li> I had a terrible break out, the first one in months, after starting this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month.  It&#x27;s hard to tell the difference yet.  I used to use Dr Dennis Gross retinol serum which is similar but way overpriced and had lots more chemicals.  I read the reviews and decided to try it.  I like how this is more natural, has great ingredients for your skin and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This serum has really helped even out my red, uneven skin.  I have been using it twice a day for 3 weeks.  Absorbs quickly and I do not have that sticky texture when I apply makeup over it in the morning.  Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Great product, my smile lines have decreased as well as my under eye wrinkles and my skin also feels tighter.</li>
    <li> I like the InstaNatural Age-Defying &amp; Skin Clearing Serum.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now, and in that time, my skin has a more youthful appearance, is lighter, and more even in tone.  The wrinkles seem less noticeable.  One warning; you must wear sunscreen and it makes you VERY sensitive to the sun!  I use the serum morning and night and recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;Two small downsides to this product:  I did not shake the product enough and the result was the 2nd half of the bottle was not well mixed. Remember to shake bottle before each use!  2nd downside is the size of the product. Because the bottle is small and used twice daily, it disappears quickly. A larger size would be nice.  Otherwise, I love it!  I have a friend who is easily 7 years younger than me, but steady use of InstaNatural Age Defying and Skin Clearing System has ME looking younger and her asking for my &amp;#34;secret!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It is a very natural serum. I use it twice daily. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, &amp; it is smoothing my skin. I&#x27;m also trying it on my arms to heal sun damaged skin. I can&#x27;t tell how that&#x27;s working yet. I definitely like this product &amp; can recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  My skin has never been so smooth and I am equally impressed with the all natural formula.</li>
    <li> Works great! Recommend using only twice a day at the most as it can dry the skin a little.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product once a day for two weeks. At 36  I am plagued with adult acne, extremely sensitive skin, and fine lines. This product has not burned or caused an allergic reaction. The fine lines have started to diminish. Best of all, my skin is clearing. I refuse to take antibiotics for acne. Benzoyl peroxide causes my skin to crack, peel, crease, and break out. Multiple other drugstore products have not cleared my skin. This wonderful serum is giving me hope! My acne scars are lightening. Existing blemishes are clearing. It is unclogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself is a milky fluid with a slight orange tint. I smooth it on after cleansing and massage my skin until fully absorbed and dry. It does not make my skin tight, and is not sticky. I follow with a natural moisturizer. The next morning my skin looks better. I definitely recommend this product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Does everything it claims to and more. Couldn&#x27;t be more impressed!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It goes on nicely, and sinks in quickly.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> This is simply wonderful stuff! It does not irritate my skin (I use jojoba oil as my moisturizer after the serum has absorbed), and it does exactly what it promises. My skin looks less ruddy and it helps to unclog congested pores and calm breakouts. It is really great for my perimenopausal (read: completely teenage-worthy, misbehaving) skin. Love it! And I am especially grateful for the natural ingredients. Keep up the awesome work, Insta Naturals--so grateful to have healthy skin care options that genuinely deliver on what is promised!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, seems to smooth my skin out some but I am still suffering with a lot of acne. My skin feels calmer after applying it and maybe less inflammed but unfortunately this product did not meet my expectations in regards to helping with breakouts.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;ve been looking for something to treat dry skin around my chin and forehead. This product has worked wonders. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. No more dry skin.</li>
    <li> An amazing product that starts to work instantly revealing great results! This serum spreads and absorbs nicely. It even smells wonderful.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now and find that it causes my skin to peel and flake when used daily but when used every other day with the InstaNatural night cream over it, my skin looks better than ever. It has been especially effective at clearing my adult acne.</li>
    <li> So happy with results. I had tiny red bumps on my forehead and acne kept popping up all over my face. I broke out worse for 3-4 days but then amazing results. No bumps, no redness and no acne!  Better than prescription stuff I tried.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems great so far. Light and non-oily, absorbs into the skin quickly. The odor is pleasant and citrusy. However, the packaging leaves little to be desired.  I really wish the company would provide this in a pump bottle.  I am almost hesitant to buy again unless I can find something better to transfer it to.</li>
    <li> I see a major difference in my skin texture and clarity after using this product.</li>
    <li> One of the best serums</li>
    <li> I love this serum, it has so many potent ingredients.  My skin has never looked better--age spots and scars are diminishing, skin looks brighter and healthier.  The value for the money is incredible!</li>
    <li> Vitamin c from insta natural is the best product for your face that I have tried. I&#x27;m telling you this stuff really does work I bought to hopefully clear my face and it did just that I waited till the bottle was done towrite a review. And it cleard my face and rid me of all my white heads I do recommend buying this I already purchase my second one. I can say I am a satisfied customer with insta natural</li>
    <li> Broke me out and I am still dealing with the mess on my face :(</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I have ever used for around my eyes for the thin lines!  THE BEST!  Nuff said?&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every darn method on the market, but this one works--really works.  I used it at night and wake up with almost no lines--and I&#x27;m a Sr. citizen!  I love this stuff, and will keep buying it so long as they make it.</li>
    <li> for some serious acne treatment creams go royalcosmetics.net</li>
    <li> This serum is AMAZING! It does everything it claims it will do for your skin (which, let&#x27;s face it, is RARE in the skin care/rejuvenation market). I order two more before my last bottle runs out so I won&#x27;t miss a day! I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  You don&#x27;t need much of the product.  This little bottle goes a long way.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This serum is excellent.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  I use a small amount in the morning under my moisturizer and at night after I wash my face.  I was especially pleased to see it also contains niacin-amide (Vitamin B3) which doctors have said helps reduce the reoccurrence of basal and squamous cell skin cancers.  I recommend this serum for anyone who is looking to keep their skin smooth, healthy and help with the issues of aging.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I can feel my skin tightness, lighter and bright in just 2 week, I am so happy and for sure I&#x27;m planing to buy this again</li>
    <li> Pleased that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It caused acne for my face although I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! I was having a lot of trouble with breakouts and blackheads and this seemed to get everything under control. Goes on nicely and feels great on the skin. Follow with lotion in the evening and SPF in the morning.</li>
    <li> Truly the best thing for your skin is this serum!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks or so now and it is amazing!  It has cleared brown spots i had, it has cleared my skin to where i feel no bumps on my skin. Just smooth soft skin.  And best of all... it has plumped up my face!  No lie!  I wake up with NO lines at all and it stays that way and my skin seems younger, more elastic, more plump.  Acts like it did when i was in my late 20s.  With continued use I&#x27;m hoping it will firm my skin as well.  It actually has already done that somewhat.  Truly, i will not buy another serum but this ever!  It has every ingredient that you skin needs.  Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Retinold, Hylauronic Acid.  These 4 ingredients together in one serum makes for savings in not having to buy them separately.  Genius serum and i truly hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  Always happens to me when i like something, it gets discontiued.  LOL  Overall, i&#x27;d say GET THIS SERUM ASAP and use it religiously!  You&#x27;ll thank me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it in combination with Zia Everyday Moisturizer with Jojoba, and my skin has improved a lot in just one month. Not sure which product is doing what because I started using them together. I purchased both from Amazon. Great natural products for about $40 both together.  You can&#x27;t beat that. My husband told me he notices a big change in my skin and I do notice the dark spots going away and my skin looks hydrated and glowing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to manage blackheads and this has helped quite a bit. After I used it for a week or so I began to notice how much smoother the skin on my face was looking. When I looked closer I could see some of the sun spots had smoothed out. I could actually see a difference where I stopped applying the cream lower on my neck. I have since started applying it further down and I&#x27;m hopeful that it will lighten other dun spots. I think it&#x27;s a great product and much more reasonably priced than most cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time this morning and I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and feels really light on my face. Like it so far... will update in a week or so to better review of this product</li>
    <li> The crisp orange scent and the skin&#x27;s soft, supple and healthy glow, that soon follows, has made this product one of my favourite things. A great way to start and to end the day. Face, neck, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and hands all benefit. Plus, it lightens scars. After only one month, I definitely will reorder this product, again and again!</li>
    <li> Works well. Moisturizing and helps with both adult acne and fine lines.</li>
    <li> Works very well and it safe and natural</li>
    <li> A bit strong smell... but has kept my skin basically clear and provides good nutrients and vitamins, without all of the harsh chemicals found in other products.</li>
    <li> Yep, I am a guy who is in touch with his sensitive side.  I am so happy all the time that I have some wrinkles now.... (damn that happiness). Mine on the old forehead run deep!  I am talking like the grand canyon of forehead wrinkles.  This stuff after a couple weeks seems to have mellowed them out quite a bit... Definitely has made them appear smaller and less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous to try this because of the salicylic acid.  I have what I considered to be sensitive skin, and am prone to acne - but this product has proven me wrong!  I honestly believe the combination of ingredients and the all-natural aspect is what makes this product different from other skin-clearing products - it is so gentle on my skin that I don&#x27;t notice it being a &amp;#34;skin-clearing&amp;#34; product.  Normally my skin would turn red, get patchy dry areas, become even more oily but none of that is happening. I have seen a wonderful smoothing effect, my pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable, I don&#x27;t break out as often and my skin has a very nice even tone. There is just a faint citrus scent that rapidly disappears once applied, it&#x27;s very subtle and calming. A little bit goes a long way, so this is a great deal for a product that I would definitely recommend trying - especially the teens and younger folk who are inundated with the chemical treatments off the shelves, you won&#x27;t need to do that to your skin anymore!</li>
    <li> Iam a woman who has been trying everything and nothing was working ... This is my best kept secret.. Got my acne under control even during my period...has been getting my complexion beautifully even... Iam on my second bottle now and extremely happy with the results !! Thanks</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I am a product junkie/beauty guru. I suffered from adult acne the moment I turned 21 and although my breakouts have FINALLLY been kept at bay (thanks to Mario Badescu products), I have a lot of hypopigmentation left and I have tried drug store products to almost every sephora brand products as well. and THIS is the ONLY thing that I have seen results with! I can swear by this products. Every morning I started seeing more and more results and cried every time. Although I&#x27;m still in early 20&#x27;s, I have really dry under-eyes. And I was already starting to see some fine lines in which my makeup would crease into as well. But not anymore! Thanks to this product. This was the first and only thing I bought from InstaNatural but now I think I&#x27;m going to stock up on all of their products! And believe me, the combination of ingredients they have come up with is truly a life-changer.</li>
    <li> Patience paid off with this product. At first my skin looked worse. My pores were larger and more clogged/irritated looking. But I figured &amp;#34;maybe it gets worse before it gets better&amp;#34;. Well I was actually right this time. My pores look so good now. I feel like a beautiful movie star or whatever lol. My acne is clearing up too, which I&#x27;m grateful for since I&#x27;m 33. I really love this stuff now. Make sure you moisturize, which was difficult with my acne prone skin. But I found that rose water mixed with glycerin is doing well at not making me break out.</li>
    <li> I was not happy using it for skin irritation and redness has stopped its use in order to rest my skin redness did not see any change in the canister is sealed is not suitable for mobility I am very sad</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum. You will not be disappointed. It deserves 10 stars. My teenage daughter is also using it for her acne prone skin and we both can see a difference in her skin. WE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love it makes my skin complexion light and the smell is awesome I&#x27;m only in my 30&#x27;s working great I use it at night as well</li>
    <li> See and feel results almost overnight. Skin looking and feeling much more healthy</li>
    <li> I was happy with the vitamin c serum. I used it with micro derma roller, had great results!!!!</li>
    <li> Super into this product. I have acne prone skin this product has really been working for me. Great customer service as well.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Very light and easily absorbed, not greasy (for those with oily skin), combats blemishes and fine lines effectively, and a small amount goes a long way.  Definitely give this product a try if you suffer from adult acne an have visual signs of aging.</li>
    <li> I found this company searching for skin care products to help with wrinkle that I have started to notice, as well as sun spots. I had tried other products for different companies with no real results until I stumbled upon InstaNatural. I ordered the vitamin c serum, and the night time moisturizer as my first order and started seeing results instantly!! I loved the fact that they had send me an email with instructions and tips for each product, and the fact that they were offering a refund if not satisfied. After I had been ordering those products regularly, they started sending me email invitations to try some of their other products for review, and of course I accepted because I absolutely love the ones I had ordered.They sent me this product for review, and was so excited that it would help my with my breakouts and clear my skin. I love the way it burns just right when you put it on knowing that it is actually doing its job. The scent is perfect, and it brightens my face and smooths it! I love the way it has improved my skin overall. I only that wish they made a larger bottle...</li>
    <li> I like the way the serum smells and feels on my skin. By following the directions and applying moisturizer afterwards it hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out at all. I think my skin looks smoother and less blotchy and smaller breakouts have cleared up. I would recommend this product for minor break-outs or wrinkles!</li>
    <li> This broke me out pretty bad. Several huge pimples within a week of starting.  Not sure of that is typical or not. My skin is usually not breakout prone. I&#x27;ve basically stopped using it. I don&#x27;t think unused it long enough to see any true benefit.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  Skin looks clearer and radiant with a glow!  Noticeable difference!  Also has great moisturizing qualities for my very dry skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has acne.  He uses this along with his acne regimen.  It seems to help keep the redness down and his skin looks brighter.</li>
    <li> I will be using these products moving forward, I have loved all that I have tried and they work well without irritation whatsoever. I had a blemish on my neck that wouldn&#x27;t go away and after using the Skin Clearing Serum for a little less than a week the blemish has cleared.</li>
    <li> excellent product, see a difference in the appearance of my skin and brightness.</li>
    <li> I love this serum because of the salicylic acid. Even though, I am in my fifths I still  break out around the chin area.  Since using the serum it has helped me keep my skin clear.  l also like to apply a moisturizer on top of it to keep my skin from drying out  Anybody with oily skin and breakouts this is a wonderful alternative.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 weeks now and already have noticeable results! My pores seem reduced, as well as my acne. My skin looks brighter and is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate their customer service. Very helpful. I will definitely be purchasing more of this serum and am looking forward to experimenting with other products from Instanatural.</li>
    <li> IM ENJOYING SEEING THE DIFFENCE IN MY SKIN IM 93 AND SOON TO BE 94 IN FEB. SO IF SOMTHING HELPS I TELL YOU!! ET</li>
    <li> I got this in place of my normal 20% vit c serum...i am still on the fence with it b\c i am scared to wear it in the am, like i did my vit c serum with out the retinol and salycilic acid...is it ok to wear this in the am? normally vit c is good for fighting free radical during the day time but since it has retinol in it, not sure if i should wear it in the morning...i will prob just stick wtih a basic vit C serum without the retnol and salicylic acid b\c i already use retinol at night and bp in the morning, dont want to do too much to my skin...i use Rx retina at night</li>
    <li> Let me tell you how to find the Holy Grail: Buy this product. DONE. This product goes on so smooth and a little goes a long way. I use about 10-12 drops to cover my entire face and to top of my neck. I do this every morning after washing my face and every night after washing, too. I also use a toner before applying this. I NEVER use a moisturizer aside from the BB cream I use under foundation each morning. I find most moisturizers break me out, but this serum has cleared 90% of my breakouts and over just 3 weeks it has cleared 80% of my dark spots and acne marks. My entire face is more even in skin tone (and I have actually been getting compliments on my skin), and I rarely have to use cover up for blemishes now. In fact, I feel confident with JUST my BB cream and NO foundation now because my skin has improved so much. (I would say I&#x27;m confident with no makeup at all, but let&#x27;s be honest... that would be a lie with or without perfectly clear skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts: The packaging in small, but it lasts a long time. The glass is dark to prevent sun exposure and oxidation of the vitamin C (because vitamin C becomes unstable and can actually cause skin damage if exposed to too much oxygen). I appreciate the bottle for keeping the product fresh longer. I also think the company is wonderful. I got an email the day I received my serum with instructions and suggestions and then a follow-up email a week later asking me how the product was working and whether or not I liked it. I said that of course I don&#x27;t like it... I am absolutely in LOVE with this product.&lt;br /&gt;This has vitamin C, Retinol, tea-tree oil and more to banish breakouts, marks, scars, hyper pigmentation, fine lines, and more. This product does NOT give me dry, flaky skin (and like I said, I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer). I do exfoliate often and I think this has helped reduce the dry skin. Anyways, you cannot go wrong with this product and I will most likely purchase the product for as long as this company is in business (no joke).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about six to sevens months now. I keep repurchasing from InstaNatural because of the high quality of professionalism, care and the high quality of the product. My skin complexion is one color. ONE color. My blemishes pop up and vanish within three days MAX. Any scars, discoloration, hyper-pigmentation is gone. My skin has NEVER looked better and, even though I&#x27;m rough, the beginning signs of laugh lines have disappeared around my cheeks and eyes. I also want to say that InstaNatural&#x27;s company (from day one of my first purchase) has sent me an email the day my packaged arrives with instructions on proper uses and care. This email goes straight to the personal email listed on my account. I feel as though the company cares about everyone who uses the products made by InstaNatural. I plan to use this for as long as it is sold (or a different product by InstaNatural). I hope this helps everyone!o joke).  EDIT:  I have been using this product for about six to sevens months now.

    <li> Absolutely recommend InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitiman C Serum. The ingredients are all top notch and you can tell as soon as you apply to your skin. This company takes a personal interest in their customers&#x27; satisfaction and stand behind all their products. I&#x27;m very excited to try more of InstaNatural&#x27;s products!!</li>
    <li> Love this product does as it says</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, that tends to get irritated and dry out very easily. I decided to start out slowly with this and work my way up to twice a day. I started with every other night, and then every night, and I am trying out twice daily now. I am really glad I started slow! It didn&#x27;t sting when I applied it, but the next morning my face would be irritated. I have had a little bit of purging from it, but as my skin is getting used to it I am loving it so much! My skin is slowly becoming a little more smooth, and my red post acne marks are slowly going away. I have had very few NEW blemishes since starting it, everything that is purging seems to be blemishes that I already had that had never really gone away completely. I am very hopeful and excited that with continued use my skin will improve even more!</li>
    <li> Works very well on acne marks. Although it is intended for face application, I am using serum to fade marks on my back and chest. I have been using it for a week and I can see a great progress.</li>
    <li> Plus side: good for blemishes - they clear up fast! I have not seen any signs of age-defying effects after several weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the plethora of positive reviews for this product. The company gives incentives away for positive reviews. I didn&#x27;t find this product to be helpful, it broke me out. It can also be a bit drying and has a high pH that is usually not helpful for your face. I would definitely skip this.</li>
    <li> No idea why this product has 5star reviews. Probably because most of the folks tried it for free. I&#x27;ve been using this product over a month and see no visible improvement in any area.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the glowing reviews, hoping it would make a difference to my daugher&#x27;s skin.  So far, she has finished the bottle and I don&#x27;t see any difference this product has made.  She does not have any negative reaction to the serum.  It is just that it&#x27;s nothing special.  I was a bit surprised as I thought Retinol is supposed to make a difference.  we also don&#x27;t like the design of the bottle.  It is like a medicine dropped.  The serum goes on like water.  I really like some of the other InstaNatural products but I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product, broke out horribly. Now too late to return. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m on my second bottle! It is very effective!</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t tell it did much.</li>
    <li> Works great. I love this product because it helps with everything I need. It has Vitamin C and Retinol to reverse fine lines and wrinkles and Salicylic Acid to help with my acne prone skin.  I mixed several droppers full in with 100% coconut oil to make a lovely face lotion. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my skin after 1 month of use. It&#x27;s better than any commercial face lotion I&#x27;ve bought in the past and cheaper!</li>
    <li> I have been SO VERY pleased with this product.  I like all their products.  You will not be disappointed.  I believe this is really geared to mature skin, so if you are in your 20&#x27;s or 30&#x27;s maybe even 40&#x27;s depending on how much sun damage you have, you may not appreciate it as much.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference</li>
    <li> For the price, it is a good product.  The retinol seems a little weak for what I&#x27;d like but definitely, my face is clearer.</li>
    <li> This serum smells wonderful, like fresh oranges.  I have used it for about three weeks and I am already pleased with the results.  I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it faded a lot of my tanning damage - makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s wife here- I love this. I&#x27;ve got skin that&#x27;s starting to get fine lines around my eyes, and also still battling the occasional acne breakout. I&#x27;ve used vitamin C in the past and liked that, but wanted something more to address more issues with less product. So far this seems great. Good texture out of the bottle and on the face. I put moisturizer on right after and there&#x27;s no issue with this layering. I noticed imporovement within days in terms of my skin&#x27;s texture and acne. Hoping to see more results on the fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum. My face is soft, smooth, and seems brighter. The serum absorbs well and smell great, like oranges.</li>
    <li> If you have even remotely sensitive skin, do NOT use this. After sticking it out and trying to find the cause of my horrible never seen before eczemz like rash, I have found that this is the culprit.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Helped fix my neck shaving rash and generally improve skin.&lt;br /&gt;Be sparing if this is your first experience using retinol so your skin can get used to it, but you probably already knew that.</li>
    <li> i ordered this as a nightly serum to help with some hormone induced skin issues and it&#x27;s been a great addition to my regimen.  a little goes a long way.  the mild peeling effect is a great bonus and awesome for acne prone skin like mine.  i&#x27;ll reorder!</li>
    <li> I really like it so far, my skin wasn&#x27;t bad, but I&#x27;m 55 and want to keep skin looking good. Saw the recommendation in Prevention, glad I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been loyal to Origins brands for years.  This product performs as good,  if not better,  for a third of the  cost. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now (sigh) and have some adult acne.  This serum minimizes the acne and gives my skin a fresh look.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne all my life. Now I also have to worry about wrinkles too. This product is amazing! The second you put the serum on your face, your skin feels rejuvenated. It looks and feels healthier. I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense but that&#x27;s how I feel. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I can&#x27;t imagine my skin routine without this serum. It really does help with acne and signs of aging (it does what the label says it will do. That&#x27;s rare these days!) I am just so happy to finally have a product I love and want to tell others about! Do your self a favor and give the age-defying &amp; skin clearing serum a try.</li>
    <li> Works well. Moisturizing, does not cause breakouts, not heavy or greasy. My skin looks much better since I started using it. Will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helped my skin look and feel smoother. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will continue to purchase it. It&#x27;s helped reduce my adult acne. My skin definitely isn&#x27;t breaking out as much and the hyperpigmentation I would get from the occasional cyst is virtually nonexistent. Turn around time on those has been reduce to half.</li>
    <li> Love...love..love..my skin has never looked this good in a very long time.</li>
    <li> This serum was perfect!  It is white, translucent in color, and texture was similar to other serums I have tried, maybe a little thinner.  It gets absorbed into your skin very quickly without any stickiness.  This serum has a variety of essence oils, including pink grapefruit oil and tea tree oil, in addition to 20% Vitamin C, 2.5% retinol, 3.5% niacinamide, and 2% salicylic acid.  Other serums I have tried had sticky residue and shininess.  This one just melts in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is faint and not too strong- it&#x27;s citrus but a little sweet, like lemon cupcake.  It is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed using this productThe packaging isn&#x27;t all that sexy (although I personally like the blue glass container), but it does its job very well.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural provided me this product in exchange with my review.</li>
    <li> The serum is very good as a night serum as it makes my face more sensitive. I have acne and it clears it up very well. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and InstaNatural.  I noticed a change in my skin in about 2 weeks.  I am able to use it twice daily with no drying or irritation.  InstaNatural also has phenomenal customer service.  I had a slightly defective bottle (basically the dropper didn&#x27;t work) and I mentioned it to the company (because they sent me an email to see how I liked the product) and they contacted me the same day and said they would send me a new bottle in 2 days. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever received such good customer service like that before.  I will definitely be purchasing from them again.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for a 20% Vitamin C serum.  I love the grapefruit fragrance, and the texture is thick enough to stay on your fingers yet smooth enough to glide evenly onto your skin; a little goes a long way.  This makes my skin feel very hydrated, so much so that I don&#x27;t apply moisturizer after my nightly application.  The follow-up email responses from the company have been stellar and very helpful regarding product use; they seem to really care that you&#x27;re happy. I&#x27;ve also purchased their Hyaluronic Acid Serum, which I use in conjunction with this product.  I haven&#x27;t yet noticed that I look ten years younger, but my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> Fake reviews!!!!! I mean F-A-K-E!! Should have knew that! Please do not waste your money on this- I&#x27;m doing you all a favor. Applied my moisturizer and it still burnt and Irritated my skin.  Goodluck ladies..</li>
    <li> I have noticed brightening of my skin after using this only a couple times. It seems to even out my skin tone as well! Really like this product!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! The best serum I have used so far! I see a difference in just a few days ...fine lines lessened and my skin appears brighter. I am very happy I purchased this product. The smell is fantastic and not sticky.  5 stars so far!!! Thinking of trying the moisturizer next!</li>
    <li> Its very good product..I saw results after a month but I was only using it once a day..no breakouts..clearer skin and smoother. I would recommend it for anyone specially if you have very oily skin.</li>
    <li> So far so good, noticed my skin looked a little more plumped, also using a derma roller with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied with this serum.  I&#x27;ve recently updated my skincare regime and started using a multi-step cleansing and moisturizing process and for a while was searching for products to help with skin blemishes and blackheads and to improve overall tone.  This serum has significantly reduced blemishes and has improved my overall skin tone and texture.  It is a great addition to any regime.  I will warn that there is about a two week break in where I found my skin was pushing out some really yucky stuff, but after that it has been consistently clear.  Also, it is important to wear sunscreen with this product.  I am very fair and so I already do, but I did increase my SPF because I found I need the extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I haven&#x27;t found improved with this product is that it hasn&#x27;t really done anything for my sun spots.  I think that may have more to do with my skin tone and the amount of damage than the product itself.  Sometimes you just need professional treatment to resolve issues and no amount of at home treatment is going to help.  I would say that for minor damage or discoloration that you will see improvement.  As I said my overall skin tone is better and more even.  But for deeper issues this isn&#x27;t going to help you and you should probably talk to a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely planning to purchase this again.  I actually knocked the bottle over and spilled some the other day so I would warn that you should put the cap on immediately and try not to flail at it.  It is a glass bottle which helps protect the serum but is a risk factor for the more klutzy of users.  I&#x27;ll be ordering my new bottle soon and look forward to being a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> the consistency changed a bit for a while&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t forget to use SPF 30 above sunscreen</li>
    <li> This is high-quality stuff! I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Within a couple weeks I have already seen a significant difference in the overall appearance of my skin. It is smoother and noticeable acne bumps have significantly been reduced. Very happy to have found this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I noticed that my acne clears up quickly and the dark areas of my face are fading. I&#x27;ve tried other products but am definitely seeing results with the Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> This stuff has transformed my hypersensitive, acne prone middle age skin in 2 weeks.  All the other creamy, heavy retinol creams made me break out but this one is fabulous.  The sun damage spots on my face have faded, blemish marks have faded and my skin is more even.  My skin is clear and bright.  Wonderful stuff!!</li>
    <li> This product is gentle and smells amazing! I was concerned it would cause a lot of redness and irritation, however it did not. It makes my skin very soft and I feel in the short time that I have been using it, that my fine lines are getting Less noticeable.  I am hoping with continues use it gets better and better!</li>
    <li> Broke out my skin and leaves a sticky film on the face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after typing &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; in an Amazon search. This product was highly recommended, although some people noticed no difference. I have hormonal acne on my chin/jawline and comedogenic acne all over my face. I&#x27;ve used Proactiv to control it for 11 years. After researching harmful chemicals in beauty products and slowly weaning myself off of their multistep system, I brought this product in.&lt;br /&gt;I am three quarters of the way through my first bottle. My acne has been slowly decreasing (though I am far from clear) and my skin appears brighter, like there is more life to it. I don&#x27;t think I will ever &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; my acne, but my skin looks so much more healthy than it did after using this product.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, and the product worked wonders on my skin. I&#x27;ve always had acne prone skin but this product really helped get rid of most of my acne. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for. I was so impressed with there professionalism, and the eager to go over and beyond to make sure that I was a satisfied customer, that I just had to apply for all of there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Excellent customer service is KEY! that will only reflect even more on their products.  It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  From their skin care, to hair care and body Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  Their products are amazing.  Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  I have seen a big difference in the look of my skin and my hair.  Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  I look forward to continue to do business with Insta Natural.  I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of every InstaNatural serum I have tried. This one combines two issues I have with my skin. Some persistent acne and the starting of fine lines. I ended up using this under my moisturizer during the day and the Retinol Serum at night. I loved how easily it absorbed and all the ingredients in it that have proven to work for me (retinol, Vitamin C, salicylic acid, etc.). With my dry skin I just wish it had some hyaluronic acid in it, too! Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I have used very expensive products in the past, renowned brands, where one serum would cost about 200$. This serum is for any concern of your skin, whether acne, dullness, acne scars or uneven skin tone. For me it worked since the first night I used it. the next morning I woke up with a clearer skin, and my pimples were dried out. It has retinol inside, and over time you will notice your skin becoming thicker and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I really regret that I didn&#x27;t buy instanatural products before, since they are so efficient and not expensive. But from now on, I have become a faithful customer. My brother uses this serum as well, and his skin has improved by far in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;for everyone like me who has been looking endlessly to find the perfect skin care, don&#x27;t bother looking at expensive creams, no cream in expensive stores has retinol, vit C, and all other ingredient combined together. plus the amount of ingredients is very low in these expensive skincare routines. you cannot go wrong with this serum.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I purchased it because I had some dark spots on my face and so far it has worked. I have noticed the blemishes are lighter.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this, it smells great and sinks into the skin quickly. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle so I could have more!</li>
    <li> I wouldnt buy this again, dont waste your money, this is like an orange juice, everytime when apply it on my face does nothing, im really regretful for buying this, it seems they have fake reviews to sell the product, it does nothing</li>
    <li> It smells nice and I like the texture, but it burns my face so bad and turns it red. I&#x27;ll try to return it if I can figure out how. Otherwise I&#x27;ll give it away and hope it doesn&#x27;t burn someone else. Disappointed, because it wasn&#x27;t cheap and I really wanted to like it.</li>
    <li> I like that this serum absorbs quickly into the skin after application. The bottle comes with a dropper making it easy to dispense. The color of the serum is white but becomes transparent when smoothed onto the skin. I have been using it with the InstaNatural Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer and have seen positive results. My blemishes are becoming lighter and the pimples I originally had from a breakout disappeared or shrank in size after 2 days. I havn&#x27;t had any bad skin reactions like redness or breakouts from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This is my go to skin care after a face wash.  It smells wonderful like an orange and helps keep blemishes lightened.  A little goes a long way and I&#x27;m still on this bottle.  My skin is sensitive and oily, so I like the fact I have a shield between my skin and make up that doesn&#x27;t worsen the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made me look younger in my 30&#x27;s but it does keep my skin glowing between my chemical peels.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT.  IT IS SO GOOD FOR MY SKIN.  QUICK INTO MY SKIN, VERY GOOD PRODUCTS. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and it has done wonders for my occasional break outs. I would recommend this product completely.</li>
    <li> I have this product as a gift, I really like the style and  it feels really good on my face I enjoy this project</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum, it is very light with a nice scent.  I have had worsening acne as an adult, and this serum has worked wonders for my skin.  Since I started using it, I have not had any breakouts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I am nearing the end of my second bottle of this serum, and my skin has never been clearer.  I have been using for almost 4 months and I love it.  1 bottle would last 3-4 months of normal use, but there are 2 of us using it in my household.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective and amazing product I have ever used. I am 40 and has been battling with acne since my 20s. I have used numerous products, almost everything you can name them, to tackle the problem but it never gives me the clear skin. Lately I have switched to Evan Healy organic blemish care kit, having high hope it will do my skin wonder but it ended up a big disappointment after trying more than a month. I broke out more and also leaving my skin feeling uncomfortably tight and flaky even though the products are oil based. It is a life saver to finally find your product and the regular shipping only took two days. I was skeptical at first about trying something new again but to my amaze, as soon as I tried, my existing acnes dried up the next morning and no more new breakouts that was unusual for the past months, yeah! One more thing is the first night I used the serum, I sprayed with my left over lemon thyme toner and the serum burned and itched my skin so much. The next day I switched to lavender toner and the problem went away. My sincere Thank you to instanatural, you have brought back my confidence again!</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  Goes on smoothly, smells great and so gentle you can even use it under and around the delicate eye area.  Noticeable improvement in my skin texture, diminished wrinkles and fine lines.  My skin is looking better.  I use a full morning and separate evening routine with Instanatural products.  Very satisfied.  Better than Estee Lauder which I had used for years.  I am saving money too.</li>
    <li> This product has really helped improve the quality of my skin.  It goes on really well and have seen consistent improvement since adding it to my regimen</li>
    <li> I have used this product w/the related VITAMIN C moisturizer for approximately 2 months twice daily (morning &amp; evening before bed). The results experienced and visibly seen, give testament to the promised results as manufactured by InstaNatural, LLC. Truly amazing skin free of blemishes, discoloration results and a more even overall skin tone due to the serums use! Highly recommend using with the Vitamin C Moisturizer: just a pea sized portion; easy to apply and comfortable coverage. Not thick or greasy. Competition of chemotherapy treatments ravaged &amp; thinned skin with total loss of natural collagen production; most noticeable on face. Skin aged beyond years and while not vain by any means, wanted to find a natural product to better complexion. Beyond happy with its results! The highest compliments of such, are when family and friends noticed exceptional skin without knowing of products used. Everyone thought skin improvement was due to recovery from chemo therapy when in fact, your skin and other damages caused by its toxicity; do not allow your body to do so. One is fortunate to be in remission and satisfied with regrowth of hair, eyebrows and eyelashes even when lesser in length and thickness than before treatments. Will continue to use as continued results with each use. Inexpensive, manufacturer not stingy with supply per bottle so lasts long! Good monies worth &amp; great investment for the health of your skin!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t ever be without it!  This is the first thing I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot) on my 56 year old skin that I can actually see a difference. The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly.  My skin feels smooth and I can see a difference in the appearance of fine lines.  Give it a try.  It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> Within a week,  my skin looked brighter, clearer, and tone with less freckle/sun damage. I feel like my skin looks more radiant.  I recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> Not quite seeing the promised results and it&#x27;s been 1 month.</li>
    <li> As a 26 year old male who has suffered from chronic mild acne since his early teen years, I had never found a product (prescription or over-the-counter) that was able to consistently and effectively control my outbreaks. Adding insult to injury, within the last 12 months, the skin on my face has experienced several cases of contact dermatitis, most likely caused by a reaction to the harsh chemicals used in acne medications. This eventually led me on the hunt for something made with more natural ingredients and this product seemed like it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see immediate results within days like some of the other reviewers but after diligently applying this serum on my face twice a day everyday for 4 weeks, my complexion has finally begun to improve and not only does my skin feel cleaner and smoother now but healthier as well. Results may vary from person to person so don&#x27;t be discouraged if it takes a while to start working. Be persistent and it will eventually pay off.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I saw results in just a few days. My pores are smaller and my acne is clearing up. This company is true to their word in providing a great product. I love the citrus smell and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
    <li> I like it. I get mild to moderate acne on and off, and because of too many meds my skin has lost its radiance and this product help. It doesnt make skin oily, it has a nice citric smell. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> my skin is much clearer and the blemishes have started to fade. I combine this Vitamin C Serum with BPT3.1 Preventive Treatment from Create Cosmetics and I have seen the results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am 56 years old and saw an improvement in my skin after the first use. It absorbs instantly and makes a pretty base for my foundation. This natural product is good for the health of my skin and the health of the planet. I will not buy animal-tested chemicals that perpetrate cruelty to vulnerable living things and increase the level of toxicity in my body. It&#x27;s a win-win for all involved. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Another great product.  Vitamin C is a great antioxidant for the skin.  The salicylic acid helps keep my face acne free.  I like the fact that it combines so many super ingredient into one.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and can see a difference.  I think people who make claims that the product doesn&#x27;t work for them, didn&#x27;t allow enough time and/or didn&#x27;t use enough.  If you&#x27;re 50yrs+, you didn&#x27;t get there overnight.  So, using this or any product isn&#x27;t going to transform you overnight either.</li>
    <li> I finished the whole bottle, but didn&#x27;t see any difference. Is it possible that the ingredients are not so active? They are mostly very unstable elements after all. I did store the bottle in the fridge all the time.</li>
    <li> THIS USED NIGHTLY REALLY HELPED MY BREAKOUTS. GOES ON SMOOTHLY AND ABSORBS QUICKLY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and my skin not only still breaks out but I&#x27;m having to deal with fine lines as well. This product PERFECTLY addresses both problems. 2 months ago my skin looked just awful. I was having unbelievable breakouts and I could see the skin on my face begining to age noticeably. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this Vitamin C Serum I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic reversal of both problems. I&#x27;ve reordered this 4 times already and have no plans on stopping. I just wish I&#x27;d found this sooner!</li>
    <li> I really love this product..it gives my skin a nice glow under my makeup and is really helping with my hormonal breakouts and pigmentation. Just another one of their products  I love .</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review InstaNatural&#x27;s stretch mark cream. I came quickly, and I was pleased when I looked at the ingredients list. Compared to other personal care products, I considered this a pretty clean product. It&#x27;s not greasy, and it smells just like Jasmine. I can&#x27;t tell if my stretch marks are less visible, but my skin is soft, not stinky, and I can feel confident that I&#x27;m nourishing my skin with minimal toxicity.</li>
    <li> The moment I applied it to my face it began to burn, after washing it off, I was left with a rash that lasted more then 2 weeks .  I do not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t so anything for my skin and i&#x27;ve been using ot for three weeks now. I see no difference in my acne, or scarring, or overall quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I was supposed to use it under my moisturizer but when I did, it really made a difference in my skins appearance.  My skin is a lot smoother with less visible wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. I do notice some mild skin irritation, which means there are actual potent ingredients.  Good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin after trying this serum. I have pretty clear skin usually but still suffer from some redness and the occasional blemish. I feel like this is really helping! I hadn&#x27;t try InstaNatural products until recently, but I&#x27;m a fan! I use this in conjunction with the Instanatural Vitamin C Facial Toner and the InstaNatural Vitamin C Moisturizer. It just takes a small application and I apply right after washing my face and applying toner.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been battling acne since I was a teenager. I&#x27;m 31 now and this has been the only product (besides prescription drugs) that&#x27;s given me hope. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 4 weeks now and have seen my face slowly clear up. I still get minor pimples but they seem to go away faster. My red marks are fading. I just bought the instanatural vitamin c toner. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a couple more months.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you hate how there is so much air in a potato chip bag and only a few chips? Well I got cheated in the quantity of thus stuff. I thought the serum would be filled to the top of the bottle,  but it was only about 60% full. As for its effects, it&#x27;s only been day 2 so I can&#x27;t say. For the price this should have been filled up all the way. 0.6 ounce won&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> So I wanted to go through a whole bottle before I wrote a review and WOW am I happy&lt;br /&gt;I had to discover my perfect combination, but I think I found it (at least for myself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Oil of Olay Cleansing brush.  I love the brush, but I don&#x27;t like the cleanser that came with it.&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Advanced-Cleansing-System-1-Count/dp/B0043OYFKU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1425906789&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;oil+of+olay+cleaning+system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I got a sample of Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser and fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Purity-Simple-One-Step-Cleanser/dp/B00021C1NG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1425906933&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;philosophy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then I added this serum:&lt;br /&gt;1st:  This stuff smells so good.  Like a very orange citrus scent that fades after about a minute.  I use 3 drops on my face, and 1 on my neck just after a shower or washing my face.  It takes maybe 2 minutes and it is completely absorbed.  I then put on my sunscreen,  I currently use this one https://www.mariobadescu.com/oil-free-moisturizer-spf-30, and I love that line.  Then I either put on my make up, or just go without.  Either way, my skin has improved dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;2nd:  My adult acne near my chin is almost GONE!  This is a huge deal because nothing else has worked and my skin is so sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;3rd:  My pores are much much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;4th: the very beginning of the wrinkles on my fore head have dramatically decreased&lt;br /&gt;5th: this bottle lasted me almost 3 months using it once, some times twice a day, and using it to spot treat random zits (it works really well for that!)  And beauty products like this can be sooooooooo expensive and this stuff is so affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister started using it after I told her about it and she loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, and I wish I found this combo of skin care sooner! If you are some what desperate like I was, it&#x27;s won&#x27;t hurt to try it.  I just ordered my second bottle and will always always use this serum.try it.  I just ordered my second bottle and will always always use this serum.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. The smell is great. Perfect for summer. Vitamin C and Retinol. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this!</li>
    <li> So far, so good... I like the creamy texture of this oil, and it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I will update with results after a few weeks use...</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this product a couple weeks. It&#x27;s OK. I was looking for a retinol to help with red marks left from acne and came across this. I do believe it&#x27;s helping with the red, but I don&#x27;t think its helping with the existing acne and I&#x27;ve had a few more breakouts since then. Also I don&#x27;t think it will go very far. It might last a month. But for what I paid I expected much more bang for my buck. I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;m going to return it yet or not. But I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Was experiencing some skin issues I hadn&#x27;t had before and this serum addresses them all. I will be a continuing customer.</li>
    <li> I am a skin care junkie and have tried  all serums. I have worked at the favorite  store for make up and skin care and tried many samples.The results I see after  two weeks  are amazing ..glowing smooth  skin.I am using all  InstaNatural products now.Again I have used  major  brands and spent way to much with  minimal  results I am doing a happy dance when  I  look at my skin!!!</li>
    <li> I was originally sceptical about this product, as it claims A LOT. I was more than pleasantly surprised that it delivered in all areas. It is excellent for blemishes, spot treatment and lightening areas where you have pigmentation issues (dark spots, scarring from old blemishes, irritated skin, etc) I started using it on a dark spot that I got during pregnancy that never went away. In a few weeks, the dark spot was noticeably lighter. I do not get many &amp;#34;zits&amp;#34;, however, I do have blemishes that come up from time to time (little red bumps, or just little irritated areas/pores), so I would dab a little in those areas too... Wow! Totally cleared those up as well, without leaving any marks or scarring. I just recently got my first &amp;#34;pimple&amp;#34; (raging, painful, monster of a zit on my chin) in many years, and while it did not get rid of it overnight, it reduced the redness, made the skin around that area feel better and stronger (didn&#x27;t get flaky or scabby) and in two weeks it was completely gone with no mark or scar or pigmentation at all. (I would also like to say that I bought this product myself, and I&#x27;m giving it this review because of the results that I&#x27;ve seen personally over the past 3 months of daily use)</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely, amazing! I have the most oily, itchy, and pimple infested skin, and it was awful using the same grocery store product over and over again. My liver wasn&#x27;t up to shape to go through isotretinoin treatments yet, so thankfully I found this! You put this on usually after washing your face/ after shower, and then put a moisturizer on. The moisturizer part is extremely important, because this product will irritate the crap out of your face if you don&#x27;t. I usually use either Dove, or Aleeve.</li>
    <li> I am a brand name skincare junkie BUT am extremely loyal once I&#x27;ve found a product that works. I have found a moisturizer that I love, but was still searching for the right serum. Especially because my skin is changing as I age. I can&#x27;t use the same products that I used 20 years ago. I did a little research and read that Vitamin C and Retinol together are very effective on the skin. I then read the ingredients and reviews for this product and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry/normal combination skin with some hyperpigmentation and dullness. After using this product for approximately two weeks, I have noticed a change in the texture of my skin (much softer) and the overall brightness of my skin (which lets me know that my cells are turning over). I use this after washing and before my moisturizer once a day and definitely will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many skin care products and this is the only one that has delivered.  It has cleared up my skin and faded dark spots.  I absolutely love it and have already ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t have wrinkles. I like the feel of this serum. It&#x27;s not too thick and it doesn&#x27;t slide around all all my face (or where ever I put it)</li>
    <li> Recently found out that I was pregnant so I believe the reaction I had to the serum was hormonal. I gave it to a friend who has been using it every day and really likes it!</li>
    <li> daily regimen addition. everyone should use this product.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant and skeptical on spending this much money on such a small quantity. I suffer from minor but continuous breakouts on my chin which my doctor told me is from stress. I&#x27;ve tried many over the counter products and natural products but nothing seemed to work long term. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and I&#x27;ve not had one breakout since then. I started using it twice a day which started to dry out my skin and cut that back to once a day which still did the trick. I didn&#x27;t notice any great change in fine lines but my skin did appear brighter. The benefit of the redness/breakouts being gone is enough for me to continue using this product and spending a little extra money on it.</li>
    <li> I use this product around my jawline where I suffer from hormonal cystic acne. I like to change up my products often because if I don&#x27;t, my breakout become unbearable. I was attracted to this product because it has such great ingredients. Vitamin C, Retinol AND Salicylic acid? Yes, please! It has worked well on my flare ups and gets the acne from red/inflamed to healing within the day. That&#x27;s amazing in my book. I like the bottle and it has a glass dropper.</li>
    <li> i tried it as soon as i got it cause having dry skin is so difficult. i wear it before putting one make up and so far i do like it</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff is amazing and works wonders on my face!</li>
    <li> I have combination oily/dry skin.  After using this product as directed for a few weeks now, my face has been breaking out with what appears to be cystic acne.  It&#x27;s awful.  Huge painful lumps in the T-zone area.  My skin wasn&#x27;t perfect to begin with, but it wasn&#x27;t this bad.  I have used retinol products in the past, and I realize that there is often an initial &amp;#34;breakout&amp;#34; period.  But these cysts are huge, and painful.  The pain isn&#x27;t worth the potential gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus, the product goes on nicely.  It wasn&#x27;t too drying.  And it smells amazing.  I would have loved for it to work for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to begin to see an effect. If you feel like it&#x27;s drying your skin out, try using it OVER the moisturizer instead of the other way around.</li>
    <li> Love it. No break outs whatsoever, and skin is looking younger every day. Only downside is when using twice a day, the bottle runs out rather quickly, and it&#x27;s not that cheap. It does work though!</li>
    <li> I got this great Vitamin C Serum during a promotion and I&amp;#34;m so happy that I had a chance to try it, I have used this for about three weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with the result it brings me.  My face is no longer dry and flaky but it&#x27;s soft and smooth, now I can tell that my face is as soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.  I use this serum every day one at night before I go to bed, I can use it with or without my night cream.  I also use this serum in the morning before applying my moisturizer and sun block.  If you have dry and flaky skin like mine I would strongly recommended this serum to try out.</li>
    <li> This is another great serum I have got to review for Instanaturals. It goes on great and leave my skin feeling and looking amazing. It has helped me with my mild acne problems. It has made my face very soft and cleared up my problem dry patches. I love that it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. I recommend to anyone looking for a great serum.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a little leery to try this product, but I have used InstaNatural products in the past with great success. This Age Defying- Skin Clearing serum contains Vitamin C Serum 20% with Retinol 2.5%, Salicylic Acid 2%, B3 and Tea Tree Oil. I thought, this sounds like too much for my somewhat sensitive skin! But my skin is showing fine lines and I have large pores. All these ingredients are reportedly good for reducing pores, minimizing lines and wrinkles and acne scars. I thought, well I won&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t try! Right?&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I took that step! This serum truly has it all. My skin looks smoother, my pores look more refined and my oily blackhead prone chin and nose look so much better. This is like a dream serum. I do use it after cleansing in the evening and before moisturizing. I make sure i give it a few minutes to full absorb before I add a moisturizer. I have not had any irritation, but as I said i do moisturize!!! I am loving it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m have been really excited to try this product! It did take awhile to be delivered but once it was delivered it was packaged safely so it wouldn&#x27;t get broken. I&#x27;m excited to see if it helps with age spots and will update it and let you know if I see results.</li>
    <li> The product is everyting it claims to be. My skin is softer and clearer. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This is a good sized bottle! Definitely worth the money. Came package with care. Would definitely recommend to anyone that loves being pampered!</li>
    <li> WELL, LIKE ALL OF THESE FACE SERUMS, I FORGET AND STOP USING AND THEN TRY AND REMEMBER IF IN THE 2 WEEKS I USED IT DID ANYTHING? I THINK IT SHOWED A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN THE AM, BUT BY NIGHT I HAD SPOTS AGAIN...I GUESS YOU HAVE TO USE IT ALL THE TIME, FOREVER TO KEEP AGE SPOTS OFF.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this serum. it does everything it promises to do. My skin glows and feels so soft and when I look in the mirror I am very pleasantly surprised how good my skin looks. Recomend this serum for anyone who wants their skin to look younger and just plain better.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 months and it is as good as advertised. Does wonders for your skin.</li>
    <li> Currently using this product! Excellent customer service above and beyond!</li>
    <li> I love all of the ingredients in this serum.  The only complaint I have is the SUPER heavy orange smell, but with a cocktail of ingredients like this that you can&#x27;t find anywhere else, I put up with it.  I wish it stated the content of the hyaluronic acid, as personally I feel like my skin needs a bit more of it than this product offers.  I use this only at night time and I slather a thick cream on top of it, since it tends to be a little bit drying.  But I&#x27;m pleased with this great blend of ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this product , it has worked wonderful for me . My skin is clear and has never looked better .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any improvement with this product, but it did tend to make my skin feel tightened after I put it on.  It worked well on a couple of sun spots that I have, diminishing their color a bit, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  I gave it three stars because the sellers were very interested in my opinion and offered to refund my money if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  Hopefully, it will work better for some people.  I&#x27;m fortunate because I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles even though I&#x27;m in my mid-60s, but I think I need to move on to another product.  This may work better on younger skin.  I had no problems with it&#x27;s use as far as break-outs or irritations, so that and the seller&#x27;s interest were worth three stars to me.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love this stuff!  Been using for about a month now and can see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve only had a few spots pop up but they went away really quickly. Also the dark spots on my face from past acne are fading away. Just ordered two more bottles, one for me and one for my sixteen year old daughter.</li>
    <li> People, this stuff works. Even after just applying this serum for 2 days at night I see a dramatic improvement in skin texture, pore size, blemish control (They&#x27;re literally disappearing). I have extremely oily skin and was afraid this would make it more so, but no, this serum absorbs right into the skin with no oily residue. So, the as the label states, this really is Skin Clearing. Thank you InstaNatural for such a quality product. I will be reordering when I run out of this first bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple of days now, but I can see a definite difference in the hydration of my skin!  I am impressed with all the organic ingredients and nothing scary and unpronounceable.  This serum smells great, like fresh oranges!  I am so far loving it and am excited to see how my skin will look and feel with continued use!  Why pay more for high-end serums?  Give this a try before digging deep into your pockets!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural&#x27;s Skin Clearing Serum for a few weeks and I&#x27;m very happy with the affect it&#x27;s had on my complexion.  I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and have used a few different &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; type serums but feel this one has made the most improvement to the texture and look of my skin.  By using it once a day (at night followed by a lotion from Alpha Hydrox) I&#x27;ve seen a decrease in redness and some of the fine lines, and my skin feels smoother.  I&#x27;ve also been so impressed by their customer service.  I received an email asking about my experience with the serum and I let them know I&#x27;d had a small breakout but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was from the serum or a new night cream I&#x27;d started using.  They asked me to follow up when I&#x27;d been able to determine which was causing the problem.  I stopped using that night cream and my skin cleared up within a week or so.  After seeing how good my skin looked after using the serum a few weeks I sent another email to InstaNatural to let them know how much I liked it and that I&#x27;d be purchasing again shortly because I&#x27;d recently knocked over the bottle and spilled most of the contents! I was so surprised to receive an offer of a complimentary bottle because of my mishap.  Now that&#x27;s amazing customer service!  Not only is this is a really good product but it&#x27;s so refreshing to know that the company behind it really cares about their customers.</li>
    <li> I used this product one time only, all over my face and I had some adverse side effects. I am a 20 year old woman, I do not have wrinkles...yet, I have mild acne on my face and back sometimes accompanied with some light scarring/discoloration. I was hoping this product would lighten the discoloration and scars, and heal my acne given enough time but I am too afraid to keep using this product. I applied a moderate amount (maybe 3 pea sized drops) to my entire face, which I guess might be a bit much judging by the other reviewers but in order to cover my whole face with an even layer, I needed 3 drops. Anyways, it goes on wonderfully, smells like oranges, made my skin feel soft. I wore it overnight and in the morning I woke up to dry, chapped, slightly wrinkled skin. I did use a moisturizer after applying, and in the morning. I didn&#x27;t have severe wrinkles, they were very, very light but EVERYWHERE. On my cheeks, nose, etc. I&#x27;m guessing that this product dried out my skin or something so much so, it had this effect but that&#x27;s just a guess. Wrinkles have improved over the past week but they&#x27;re not completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive but for a product to cause wrinkling of the skin, it&#x27;s just not something I want to mess with. I would suggest being very careful using this. Maybe it works, but I just can not risk causing premature aging I&#x27;d rather have a few zits than a few wrinkles. As for the rest of the bottle, I added it to a bottle of lotion to use on my thighs for cellulite. Apparently retinol and vitamin C are also great for cellulite and since the skin on my thighs seems stronger and less irritable than my face, I figure it&#x27;s worth a shot. I&#x27;ve used it once so far on my thighs and I&#x27;m not having any issues, so maybe my skin is just too sensitive for the product (on my face anyways).</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few months &amp; feel like my skin is smoother and brighter, but I would not say a dramatic change.  Definitely a nice consistency serum, unlike others I have tried that are very watery and hard to spread for full coverage.  Good product.</li>
    <li> skin really tingles but looks radiant the next morning</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I should have stumbled upon it sooner. I noticed a huge difference in my skin tone and blemishes after a couple of days</li>
    <li> Love the packaging. Easy to use, great quality product. Heavy duty skin care with Vitamin C and Retinol. Really helps with discolored spots, sun damage, etc. Great packaging, company even sends extra information about the product. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This serum comes in a great dropped bottle for easy application.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a few drops for your entire face. Apply this before your moisturizers but after your face wash.  Really helps to tighten your fine lines. *product provided for review*</li>
    <li> So far I have been loving this! I use this about 2-3 times a week at night before bed. I have VERY oily skin and I am in my 40s and have break outs. This helps tam the oil some. As far as wrinkles or smoothing out the skin and my completion- not sure really- I haven&#x27;t seen much change really. Maybe after this bottle is completed I will notice a difference. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a skin-changer for sure! I was having very problematic skin since Nov. of 2014, waking up and having bumps all over my face and turning into cystic acne. After a week of using this I noticed a HUGE difference. The bumps on my face are barely there, there has been noticeable lightening of the dark spots on my face and the acne is a lot more sparse and less cystic. I wash my face with coconut oil, then let it air dry, then moisturize with vitamin E oil or jojoba oil and end it off with this. I will most definitely be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this, it smells great!! But I think my skin is a little too sensitive for it, it made my skin really red for a while after I applied it the first few times.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! My skin looks better than it has in years! My blemishes have completely cleared up and my skin looks younger and brighter. I have ordered my second bottle and hope this product is around for years! I have recommended it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 3 weeks now, so far so good! It doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin and it clears acne!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and except for an occasional blemish, it has really helped clear my skin and even out my skin tone. I use it morning and night, even under my makeup. It smells wonderful too. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Usually a bit of a skeptic, I was happily surprised with the results after using this product for about two weeks. Unfortunately, I have all of the symptoms it addresses, acne, wrinkles, etc., and I do notice that it has helped clear the acne, and even changed the texture of my skin to be healthier looking, more refreshed.  Better results than many much pricier products, besides addressing multiple issues in a holistic way.  Service was good (delivered in good time). Have purchased this again and am pleased all around.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m in my 40s, so I really hated the fact that my skin started breaking out worse than it ever did when I was a teenager. I mean come on -- having to fight off zits at the same time you&#x27;re fighting off wrinkles?!  So not fair.  I was pretty skeptical even though most of the reviews were fabulous. But, I&#x27;ve used this serum for 2 months now and my skin is completely clear.  (I did see results within a couple of weeks -- but didn&#x27;t get around to reviewing until now.)  Plus, my skin looks better than it has in years.  Not every line has disappeared, but I continue to see improvement beyond what I thought was possible.</li>
    <li> lighy weight, quickly absorbs and hydrates.&lt;br /&gt;I warm up my hands after I distribute and press the product into my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, it is helping me to disappear some acne I had on my forehead.</li>
    <li> This product didnt do anything for me. It stings too.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I have recommended it to all my friends at the gym, and they are all using it now.  I truly mean this...about 6 of them are now as devoted as I am.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have adult acne and scars with hyperpigmentation.  I have tried many products from over priced cosmectics and those prescribed by a dermatologist.  Most usually ineffective or just making matters worse.  I have not had these issues with this serum.  My skin is improving daily, my scars are clearing and I have not had any breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I am exceptionally pleased with the product.  I have to be honest and write that I have good skin to begin with, but this product has made it even more radiant.  I love how my skin tingles after applying it.  That tells me that it is truly working.  If you have sensitive skin, only use a little to start, but I believe that this product has all the right stuff to make everybody&#x27;s skin look great.  Five stars*****</li>
    <li> This serum is helping my skin feel healthier every time I use it!</li>
    <li> I love the serum and my face is truly glowing and no more break outs.  I only wish they would create a daily moisturizer with SPF 15 or higher for daily use and not just for night time.</li>
    <li> Works great! I love the smell &amp; fresh tingle when applying to my face. I saw a difference in my &amp;#34;adult acne face&amp;#34; in the first overnight application. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because even using with moisturizer it left my nose a little dry.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s such a great product as it didn&#x27;t give my sensitive skin any breakouts, and also I found that my skin was much more softer and smoother after using it every night. I have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t feel like this serum caused any irritation or inflammation of any sort. I hope I can keep using this product and I&#x27;m definitely buying it again!</li>
    <li> I already have another bottle of this waiting in my Amazon cart. I take a shower and put it on after I pat dry my face. It&#x27;s got a great citrus smell - but it is NOT overbearing or &amp;#34;fakey.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s not oily, it goes on my face and my skin sort of drinks it up. I leave it on for about 1-2 minutes -- usually by the time I make my bed it&#x27;s been soaked in and I apply my makeup over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t broken out since I started using this product. My skin is smooth and soft and my overall complexion is more even toned. I was using rose-water for a while before this, and that worked really well, too. So, when I remember, I use the rose-water THEN this. I don&#x27;t generally use it 2x a day, just in the morning, but in a month or so I&#x27;ve seen the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product, especially if you have problem or combination skin. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use it if you have &amp;#34;difficult skin.&amp;#34; I *had* difficult skin and now I don&#x27;t. I just don&#x27;t. OK, yes, I get a pimple here or there - but...even if you pick at your pimples (ugh, I know you shouldn&#x27;t but I can&#x27;t help it) and you get a red spot, this stuff seems to be really &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34;...it both takes the red out (again, I put it on in the AM after a shower and let it &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34;) AND it seems to reduce the healing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super fair, but I surf, so I get some peeling now and again or areas where my face just isn&#x27;t an even complexion. No worries now, this stuff is better than aloe for calming and really helped my skin sort of normalize after I had a bit too much sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love it. I have told all my friends about it. I&#x27;m pretty young still, no wrinkles, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing something in that department, too. Everything I read says start your &amp;#34;anti-wrinkle routine&amp;#34; early, so...might as well start with this stuff. I don&#x27;t say this often, but it&#x27;s sort of a miracle...a little secret miracle in a bottle...so glad I read the reviews and gave it a shot! ^-^</li>
    <li> This product has saved my skin. So clear, lines plumped and I will continue to buy over and over again. Customer service is also awesome!!! After years of trying products so happy that I have one that clears and makes me look younger at the same time!!</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to this. Skin is red and I have broken out in a big way on both sides of my face (I never had a problem before). Not for me. Also, I noticed &#x27;Phenoxyethanol&#x27; is included in the formula, it is an ingredient that is very bad! Look it up. Hopefully, in time, my skin will heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have used Retinol and Vitamin C before and I never had problems, it was just this product. Perhaps it was the &#x27;Salicylic Acid&#x27; I don&#x27;t know?</li>
    <li> I adore this serum. I apply it after using my dermaroller.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great orange scent. And it makes my skin soooo smooth the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would make a larger container for this product though.&lt;br /&gt;Please do!!!!</li>
    <li> Another great serum that has really given my skin clarity, definition &amp; a glow. I get many compliments on my skin now whereas, before, it was dull &amp; sun damaged. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle.it caused all my acne went away and left me a clear skin without any scar.</li>
    <li> really doesn&#x27;t work for me. feel so itch every time after i use it and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> this product is awesome.  keeps skin firm, youthful and clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite serum, I use it every night, the next day my skin feel soft and bright.</li>
    <li> I am one to break out.. with everything.. even the stuff that says.. miracle cure. This is nice.. it does not cause me to break out.. smells nice, and I believe it is helpful to the texture of my skin, and maybe helps with the break outs too.. I would buy it again to continue to evaluate it.</li>
    <li> Natural skincare is the only way to go!..save your money on all those expensive promises that are broken!!.. This stuff ROCKS!!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference in my skin. It does have a pleasant smell and feels refreshing after application</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that I just spent $90 on a name brand face serum and this $20 bottle of magic works way better. It cleared up a stubborn blemish I&#x27;d been fighting with for over a week in 1 night.  Rest of my skin looks overall smoother too, and this is just after 1 week of using it.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see any difference.  I keep using thinking it&#x27;ll take some time due to my age...56.</li>
    <li> I liked so much I had to use pen and finish . I&#x27;ll wait my next trip to the US to buy more and use continuously.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for miracle fix-its on amazon. 75% of the time, the products do not live up to the hype despite the great reviews. I usually just blame my personal biology for the failures. Well I am happy to say that this product has lived up to the hype.  I ran out of Proactiv and it has always been a good regiment for my skin which is prone to occasional zits which have a tendency to leave me with die hard blemishes. So anyway, I decided to try something else and found this product. During the time between my running out of Proactiv and buying this I had a series of breakouts. Since I have been using this, my breakouts have totally stopped and my blemishes have faded some (I still haven&#x27;t found anything really effective to get rid of them). Glad to post a positive review for a well deserving product!</li>
    <li> I used this product hoping it would help with my uneven skin tone and dehydrated skin. I was hoping for great results after reading all the positive reviews. Boy do I regret! This product has made my skin very dry and itchy. It&#x27;s as if I have rashes in certain areas. My face is breaking out all over. I am very displeased and disappointed. I would rather have the product have no effect than to do this to my skin. Perhaps it is just my skin and I hope others have  more positive results. I will not be using anymore!</li>
    <li> Tried it for two months. Really wanted it to work, but it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my skin. If anything, it makes it oily. Especially when I would put the retinol moisturizer on afterward. Didn&#x27;t make my face break out, but didn&#x27;t make any positive changes either. Probably won&#x27;t be buying another bottle.</li>
    <li> The product is GREAT and works well, but the bottle seems to be a tiny bit faulty and leaks at the top even when closed securely. It&#x27;s annoying because (a) I&#x27;m losing product (b) it&#x27;s oxidising and gross around the edges and (c) means I can&#x27;t take it with me when I travel. Otherwise, really happy with the product itself.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their skin health on their face.  Below is my recent email to the company.  I highly recommend using this product with an all natural facial cleanser and all natural facial moisturizer with SPF.  I currently use Every Man Jack facial cleanser and Jack Black Double Duty Facial Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the Ceo:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using your product for weeks, while I have a had limited&lt;br /&gt;compliments since using your product, I am satisfied with the product.  I&lt;br /&gt;believe the lack of compliments is due to the fact I work with all males,&lt;br /&gt;however a few of my female friends have noticed my skin to be smoother and&lt;br /&gt;healthier looking.  While I may be no brad pitt, my skin is definitely&lt;br /&gt;doing better since implementing your product as well as an every day&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a review of this great product since I received it about a month or so ago; but my dog was sick and he did pass away last week.  So with taking care of him, I also had not been consistent in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, of course I used it immediately because I have been so happy with the results of Insta Natural&#x27;s facial oil cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just turned 60 and have taken care of my dry and sensitive skin since my teens.  (Anyone remember Noxema)?  lol!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have fine lines around my eyes and my mouth and two deep furrows on my forehead.  ALSO, I don&#x27;t know what they are called, but I know they are not just &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;.  When I was 40, I incurred a very serious head and nose injury.  Two years later these spots appeared on each side of my temple.  They are brown, raised, irregular and ugly.  I know that they were caused from the trauma my head incurred.  My nose was also broken which left a serious scar on the bridge of my nose.  I went to a plastic surgeon to inquire about fixing my nose.  He said it couldn&#x27;t be done (but that&#x27;s another story).  What he did suggest was laser surgery to treat the scar and those raised brown spots on my temples. He did not explain to me that for a few $&#x27;s more I could have had my entire face done!!!  From the laser surgery, the brown spots disappeared, but the scar on the bridge and to the right of my nose, well, I guess he did the best he could do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now 20 years later, well, maybe about 3 years ago, these spots on my temple have reappeared.  I know it is from the trauma my head went through.  I have sclerosis of the brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately using this serum and using the facial oil cleanser, (which I give myself a facial massage with a couple times/week); the brown spots have started to peel away.  I&#x27;m not kidding, these products work VERY WELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Thumper&#x27;s death, (my little 16 year old doxie); I decided to try an experiment with this serum.  I am only using it on the right side of my face.  It&#x27;s been about a week now and I can see a BIG DIFFERENCE between the two sides.  The brow furrow on the right side is a lot less deeper than the left.  My crow&#x27;s feet and lines around my mouth are also not as deep as the left side either.  The brown ugly spot at the temple is also smoother than the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night after examining the results, I decided my experiment is over and put the serum on both sides.  Today, the brown spot on the left side has another layer peeling off.  Time for another facial with the cleanser to help peel it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this serum by Insta Natural and was NOT asked to review it.  What you just read is what is really happening to my face and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about it!!!  I look forward to buying more of their fantastic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two more things to report after just looking in the mirror.  The scar on the right side of my nose is improving AND I forgot to mention the lines that they call the &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; on the forehead above the bridge of the nose; the right side I was experimenting on, well, that line is almost gone!!!  It is half the size in length than the left side and is also plumped up or filled in or whatever I&#x27;m trying to say is that it is disappearing also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I just want to say that just by using these two products in conjunction with each other have made a big improvement to my complexion.</li>
    <li> Cant believe how good I Look...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female, yet this review is under my husband. So far I&#x27;m absolutely loving this product. I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week now, but it instantly tightens my pores, which is pretty much a miracle for me. I am 42, and with the extreme stress I&#x27;ve been under for the past 1 1/2 years, the aging process has kicked in full gear :-(. I love how this feels on my skin! It has a clean, refreshing feel, which is very nice. I have very oily skin, and this helps even it out nicely, lessening the extreme shine, without drying or dulling my skin in the slightest. I&#x27;m actually going to try and just use this serum without using a moisturizer and see how it does. I have used the Vitamin C Moisturizer, but I&#x27;m not 100% on how I feel about it yet. Had a little creamier feel than I had hoped for, but today I only used a tiny drop and gently applied/dabbed it around my less oily areas, and it seems to have worked nicely that way. I also started using the &amp;#34;Youth Express Eye Gel&amp;#34; which also instantly smooths and tightens fine lines. Brightens up my eyes, even after a couple sleepless nights in a row. Another true amazement!!! Looking forward to seeing what the long term results can bring. Also have a few other InstaNatural products I&#x27;d like to try shortly. Very pleased so far as a NEW InstaNatural Customer!</li>
    <li> i received this product complimentary for testing purposes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many things I like about this product! the packaging is so chic! its in a heavy glass jar with a dropper.  The scent is faint and smells like oranges. It absorbs really well into my face and dries without being oily. I use the moisturizer after applying the serum. These products can be used under your makeup as well. I have noticed a great change in my face since using these two products together combined with my regular skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;My dark spots and redness have great decreased IM IN LOVE!</li>
    <li> This did not suite my skin. I burnt me. I have to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 41 y/o female who suffers from adult acne and age spots. My nightly routine included using 3 different products on my face in an effort to attack 3 problems: acne, age spots and moisture. This product gives me all 3 and I have eliminated all the other products that I have been using (saving me a lot of money as well). This product is light, smells good and absorbs quickly. I also have very sensitive skin and I did not have a reaction with this product. I wish I had this product 20 years ago! My skin is now clear, even toned and it literally glows. I have also used less make up since using this product. I highly recommend this product if you are serious about your skin care.</li>
    <li> Works great! My face looks smoother and make up is easier to apply. It zaps blemishes immediately. Dark spots have started to lighten up. Give it 2 weeks, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not been using this too long so it&#x27;s hard to say all the effects, but so far I simply love it. It smells great and works really well as a moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been mixing it with a little coconut oil, but I honestly don&#x27;t think I need it. It&#x27;s all but eliminated my dry flakey skin, I haven&#x27;t seen any new breakouts. I&#x27;m hoping it will start to hep fade old acne scars, but I know that takes time. For the price, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful little facial support which last long! I like it very much and enjoy its smell and effect. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum!  At first I didn&#x27;t see too many reviews on it&#x27;s effectiveness on acne but thought I would give it a try and am glad I did! I have acne prone and oily skin and have used everything from OTC products to prescription products.  I am amazed at how this has helped not only clear much of my acne, but also unclog pores and make healing time of any breakouts much quicker.  I have also noticed a decrease in acne scars and an increase in the softens of my skin.  I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!</li>
    <li> I really like this. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and it seems to keep my skin nice and exfoliated and bright. I&#x27;m going to consider using it and may even consider selling it to my clients for skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> My skin has been dull lately, and this serum brightened it back up. Over the course of 2 weeks, I gradually started to notice a change in my complexion. It gives your skin a nice glow, while making it resilient to the harsh seasonal elements. I was not disappointed at all with my results from this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received free for review purposes</li>
    <li> The only product you will ever need. Within a week of using this product I started getting compliments on my skin from friends and family. I have already reordered three times. I have no need for any of my other products!</li>
    <li> I NEVER write product reviews until now!  This is amazing!  As a 46 year old woman with blotchy spots on my cheeks, I put this on my face at night, woke up the next morning and the discoloration was GONE.  Miracle potion for the middle aged!!!!  And one bottle will last a very very long time as such a little goes a long way.  My eyelids are also less puffy and a noticable difference in my laugh lines.  Highly recommend this product to even the biggest skeptic !</li>
    <li> Where has this product been all my life? I don&#x27;t know but I am glad I found it. I am a 23 year old so mostly purchased this in hopes that it would aid with issues like acne and brown spots left overgrown breakouts and also the large pores on my cheeks. I have been using this product for three weeks now and my skin is really responding well to it. No break outs, spots are fading and my pores are less visible. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It seems that most of the positive reviews are posted by the product manufacturer as they all have fake names. The product doesn&#x27;t do much, I also bought their Vitamin C cream and that one had also approximately 300+ mostly positive reviews, but didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me except for making me break out because it&#x27;s too greasy. I have very ground doubts that these 300 reviews are real. All of their products have around 300 reviews, all very similar, product didn&#x27;t deliver at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for more than a month. Not much of a use. There is not even 1% of difference. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Age Defying skin clearing serum for about two weeks now. About two years ago I switched from oral birth control to an IUD. I was 29 at the time and ever since the switch, I have been battling acne on my chin, cheeks and my temple. I thought I had beautiful, flawless skin, but it turns out it was a complete lie!! It was all chemically induced! So while it&#x27;s great I have less artificial chemicals in my system, now I have to battle acne. I am an active walker, I run 5k&#x27;s and do brazilian jitsu- so I sweat alot and come in contact with alot of bacteria. I have tried numerous over the counter solutions -2, 5, 10% benzoyl peroxide, mud masks, pads, acne toners etc. Nothing made an impact. I finally went to a dermatologist who prescribed antibiotics, body wash and cream. I could only afford the 33 dollar antibiotic and acne cream because they gave me a rebate coupon which dropped the price of the acne treatment from $250 to 25!! I didn&#x27;t purchase the body wash because I was afraid my Insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it (and I didn&#x27;t want to get stuck with a 250 bill!!). I found an acne body wash on the shelf instead. After about a month I still had a new white head everyday! They were painful and not to mention the scarring on my chin. So I started looking on the internet because my prescribed face cream was about to run out and it wasn&#x27;t working to my satisfaction. I saw the age defying skin clearing serum and read the reviews. So I figured, what&#x27;s to lose? I ordered it plus the vitamin C and night cream because they too had great reviews and I needed a moisturizer that would help my scarring and not plug my pores. I also bought proactive deep cleansing wash, which I would use to wash my face with before applying the instanatural serum and moisurizers. It too had salicylic acid. OH MY GOODNESS!! In about a week or less, my face looked better then it had in two years!!! The number of active zits went down and most importantly, my scarring had begun to heal. Two weeks later I am no longer taking the antibiotic and my husband said the transformation is amazing! I am finally not feeling so self conscious about my chin, starting to wear makeup again and have thrown away all my other washes and creams. My face feels mosturized and I think younger! I feel great about putting the serum on my face because it doesnt leave a white pasty residue like most acne products and its not terribly drying like others as well! Hopefully these products are around a long time because I&#x27;ve finally found a system that works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; An instanatural fanatic, Stacieeeks later I am no longer taking the antibiotic and my husband said the transformation is amazing!

    <li> So happy and much satisfied with this product. Gonna purchase my second bottle soon. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Great for aging lines.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, provides a nice glow!</li>
    <li> it has only very small % of tea tree oil, smells bad and the battle is  cheap! ( will never buy it again</li>
    <li> Worked very well, smells good too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Instanatural&#x27;s Argan Oil for a year now but during this winter I have been breaking out so badly on both sides of my neck &amp; cheeks! I&#x27;ve been prone to acne eversince and hormonal adult acne is just the worse kind! And so I went ahead to give this serum a try and so far my acne has been clearing out in time. Not overnight though but two weeks since I bought this it has been helping out real good! My acne are no longer inflammed and I like the fact that it has retinol &amp; vit c to help when acne fades out. Love this!</li>
    <li> I just turned 32 recently and was 100% wrinkle-free up until about 3 months ago.  I have been getting bad tension headaches which have left a permanent horizontal line across my forehead:(  I don&#x27;t know why, but it bugs the heck out of me despite it isn&#x27;t that bad.  I went from feeling like the fountain of youth to wanting to cover my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried moisturizers, anti-aging creams, etc.  After weeks of trying all those the only difference I noticed was my skin became oily.  Bummer.  Anyway, I ordered this due to all of the good reviews, and I am pleased so far!!  Obviously a wrinkle cannot completely disappear, but it has toned itself down a lot after just 2 weeks of use!  It doesn&#x27;t bug me nearly as much.  I also have been told by people I see regularly that my skin \\&quot;has a nice glow to it\\&quot;.  I notice it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on first thing in the morning before makeup, then again at night.  It dries quickly and does not make your skin feel oily at all.  It honestly just makes the texture of your skin feel really soft.  I love it.  Overall this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with deep cystic type acne for years that would break out on my chin.  I&#x27;ve had scarring and as soon as I cleared one deep serious pimple, another would start up.  I realized salicylic acid helped, but I realized I needed more moisture and help for wrinkles and firmness and I wanted to try the Instanatural serum because of all the other ingredients like  Retinol, 2% Salicylic, and Tea Tree Oil. I&#x27;ve been using the product for over 2 months, and really loving it. I&#x27;m getting smaller pores, fewer breakouts and the tone of my skin is improving.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better! It literally glows. I love this product so much!</li>
    <li> Just like the cream, this serum has a nice sticky-cream colored texture. It is very moisturizing but does not overbear the skin, so this is great for normal to combo skin types. I LOVE that this product contains salicylic acid! It has been helping to keep acne and breakouts at bay, It does not irritate my skin or my eyes!! (even with salicylic acid!!). I believe combining this product with the cream was what may have made me get two shades lighter. My skin has been glowing ever since I started using InstaNatural products, I haven&#x27;t had any redness or flare-ups/irritation since I started using this product even with sensitive skin. I plan to make this a staple serum for winter time, and maybe extend into summer and use it only at nights as my skin gets oilier.  -Oreleona [Product provided for free for testing purposes]</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. It improves your skin texture with each use. Doesn&#x27;t clear your skin completely but it does control it and I can&#x27;t stop looking at my face on how transformed it looks so smooth and. Calm. Will use this for a lifetime!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t bother writing reviews, but I had to for this product. I have oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin that is starting to show signs of aging (fine lines, sun damage, minor acne scars) and often have break-outs with new products. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week (once per day, at night) and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in my skin.  The pores on my nose unclogged (all the gunk just dissolved!), the texture of my skin is smoother and the dark spots are starting to fade. I&#x27;m also less oily during the day. I would recommend starting with once a day or once every other day application if you have sensitive skin, and make sure you cleanse VERY thoroughly (I double cleanse with oil cleanser first and then a gentle foaming cleanser) and wipe away any remaining dirt with toner before applying. I&#x27;m thrilled with this product so far!</li>
    <li> I have been using several of the products by InstaNaturals so it is hard for me to separate the reviews. But these are very nice products with more natural ingredients that I like.  Their customer service is great if you have any issues or questions. I recommend this entire line over chemical laden, over priced products.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! leaves my skin super soft I will continue to keep purchasing this product. I have very dry sensitive acne prone skin and it is not irritating or drying at all. So I can use it every day unlike other products my dermatologist prescribed me which is too strong and very drying but effective only thing is I don&#x27;t like walking around with my face peeling looking like a puzzle. So this is my life saver! Can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> I have not had any issues with this serum.  As a matter of fact, my face loves it.  I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> I swear, Instanatural has the BEST serums.  Let me break down this particular one for y&#x27;all:  20% vitamin C, 2.5% retinol, 2% salicylic acid, and B3 + tea tree oil.  Yeah, contains all sorts of goodness.  This serum is super gentle full of natural and organic stuffs that make it safe for all skin types.  Soothes blemishes like whoa and repairs damaged skin while protecting against future damage.  Works well for guys an gals alike!  Lovely texture - thick but absorbs well.  As a plus, this serum smells like heaven, ha.  Seriously though.  I put it on after applying moisturizer.  A few drops will do the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.  All opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;serum is nice and thick and not runny at all! Has a clean citrus fragrance. Good buy, will be back when I run low. Thank you.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Did make my skin feel soft but I broke out worse than ever!</li>
    <li> Since using this product  I find my skin if softer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I believe that with regular use over the last two months that the lines on my face are considerably lessened.</li>
    <li> awesome product a must try!!! must buy!!</li>
    <li> Serum smells really nice. Noticed skin is smooth and have not had a break out for the week I started using it. Noticed some lightening of acne scar. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I love the combination of Serum and Retinol.. Save money and much easier to apply (less products).  Great ingredients , safe for your skin &#x3D; great investment.</li>
    <li> Seeing great results!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin, I am in my late 20s. I&#x27;m concered mostly about my acne and scars, and secondarily about aging, lastly about moist smooth skin (despite being oily, it&#x27;s always dry from acne products). I use this and let it dry, followed by tea tree oil moisturizer and my face is not only clear, but RADIANT. If I do get a bump I can pop it easily (yes I&#x27;m a popper) and the mark that would normally be left behind, just blends into my rosy skin. I love this stuff, it makes my skin feel so smooth and luxurious (I do a tca/salicylic acid peel about once a week too).</li>
    <li> This is the very best serum I have ever used! I apply it every night before bed, after cleansing and before I apply moisturizer. My skin is clearing up!!!!! The small pimples at the jawline and on forehead have diminished significantly. I am so happy with this product and will continue to purchase. Great product line!!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C is super good the smell of Orange, as if you had just eat an orange, the Vitamin C Serum is so good that you see the strength and shine to your skin from the first time you use it, &amp;#34;I love &amp;#34;really happy&amp;#34; this Serum, I will be client in this Vitamin C Serum. No.  Skin Clearing Serum also is the best that can buy this product help to firm you skin in just a few days</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews. But this company has gone above and beyond. I have cystic acne and have tried everything from Proactiv+ to all the other over the counter acne meds that would work for little bit but then stop or not work at all. This stuff is amazing. It has pretty much stopped the cystic acne from becoming inflamed and a mess. I had one that in 2 days it was completely gone. The bottle I had wouldn&#x27;t stay closed and I wrote to them asking what to do to keep it shut and they are sending me a new bottle. To me that is above and beyond customer service. I didn&#x27;t expect a new bottle but wow they really care about their customers. Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well and the owner, AJ, really keeps in touch with you to make sure you are pleased with the product and are not having any redness or other problems.</li>
    <li> “I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.”&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a week and did not see any improvement as it claims. First, this is not a serum, it is more like a thin liquid. The direction labeling on the bottle is so small, I needed a magnifying glass to read it. I would suggest that the company provides a readable product description/directions. This &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; irritated my skin and created a very strong burning sensation. I would try to leave it on for as long as I could but would have to wash it off and apply a cool damp clothe to my face to reduce the burning that it created.</li>
