    <li> I have bought lots of brush hair rollers over the years trying to find the ones like I&#x27;ve used for 40 years and finally I found them from you!  Thanks so much I love them!  They are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> They stay in, stay in place and do the job. The design allows your hair to dry supper fast if it&#x27;s not too long</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found these I have looked everywhere for them.  Amazon has everything you want especially things you can&#x27;t find  anywhere else.  They are much better than my old ones.  The bristles are longer  and stronger.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect (exactly as listed) and the quality is great.  I have looked for these every where.  So nice to not have to buy multiple sizes just to get the size you need.</li>

I&#x27;ve searched stores around my home for at least a year and never found any at all.  I searched for these on Amazon and found one set that would work.  Mother says they&#x27;re a little bigger around than she&#x27;s used to, but they work.  And that&#x27;s all she wanted.</li>
    <li> Had looked for them for a long time.  Had them when I was young and I got rid of them. Was so happy to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
