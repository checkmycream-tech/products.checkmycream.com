      <li>They kept catching my skin the first time I used them.  </li>

      <li>the twilight razor gave me a smooth shave without the slime.</li>
      <li>I just bought these on here to get my order up to $35 for the free shipping</li>
      <li>I have used these razors for several years and have been happy with them.  </li>
      <li>My legs silky smooth.</li>
      <li>The twilight razor gave me a close, smooth shave on my legs.</li>
      <li>Fantastic quality</li>
      <li>I buy cheap razors</li>
      <li>BIC products are cheap you get what you pay for</li>
      <li>My pits and legs are oh so smooth.  </li>
      <li>but so far so good</li>
      <li>It gave me a clean shave, my skin did not get irritated, and I like the rubber grip.</li>
      <li>Simple, a good deal, and it does the job well.</li>
      <li>They are only good for one leg.  </li>
      <li>They were delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m a super saver now.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend these at all, unless you are looking for a quick throwaway and you don&#x27;t mind the pain.</li>
      <li>I have discovered that as you get older, you really need a razor that swivels, but these do a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used cheap single blade razors that work better!</li>
      <li>very sharp blades that are perfect for those sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>if you have sensitive skin you should spring for better razors,</li>
      <li>good for a throw away razor if you like pink</li>
      <li>Even a brand new razor never provided a satiny smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>I tried these out for a few months, and although they have a nice, steady handle, the razors were more harm than they were help.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have much hair on their face, so who knows what they do with the things, but they do seem to disappear rather quickly in my home.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so these do the job just fine.</li>
      <li>Smooth and easy, like the handle grip and price compared to the other cheapy ones</li>
      <li>I was truly amazed and would reccomend this razor to other women looking to get a super close shave :)</li>
      <li>They work really well and glide on your skin and give you a close shave</li>
      <li>a real keeper.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care too much for these razors.  </li>
      <li>It really annoys me (can you tell?)</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and the lubricating strips left my legs razor bump free.</li>
      <li>These are cheaper, simpler and give me a real close shave.  </li>
      <li>These razors give a good shave and can be used - in my case - at least a half-dozen times.</li>
      <li>Cut my legs more than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>They do not require any maintenance, good to use just from the box and last for a while or until you become bored with them and switch to another brand or method : ).  </li>
      <li>The only thing I liked about these razors was the wide rubbery handle.  </li>
      <li>Love these little disposable razors!</li>
      <li>I picked them up because they looked nice and were similar to another brand I usually get.</li>
      <li>old daughter got her legs all ripped up by these things, even with using shaving cream.</li>
      <li>These Bic Soleil razors provide a close shave and do not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>He wanted to see how fast it would grow back.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really love these razors, gave my legs a really smooth shave and did not leave any stuble. Did not cut my legs or leave a rash as some other brands have - the lubricating strips with lanolin and vitamin E really help. Really loved the design of the handle which is flat and covered in rubber AND scented with Lavender - a really great touch. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> For a disposable razor, these razors are great! It gave me a clean shave, my skin did not get irritated, and I like the rubber grip. Definitely good for the money!</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  Fun colors, easy to hold, glides nicely.  Always a good price!  My girls refuse to use anything that isn&#x27;t a Bic Soleil.</li>
    <li> good for a throw away razor if you like pink</li>
    <li> I got the 4 +2 pack sent to me. I love them. Never cut myself while shaving. Smell good. And keeps you hairless.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care too much for these razors.  The blades seem to dull quickly, leading to razor burn on my legs after just 2 or 3 uses.  I&#x27;ve used 4 or 5 of these razors, with different types of shaving creams, body washes, soap, hair conditioner and baby oil to lubricate my legs and the same razor burn happened.  I think the actual blades are too thick to cut effectively.  Even a brand new razor never provided a satiny smooth shave.  I also cut my shins several times since the head does not pivot and the blades are not springy on the sides like other ladies&#x27; razors.  The only thing I liked about these razors was the wide rubbery handle.  It was easy to hold onto in the shower.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these razors at all.  They seem over priced considering the shoddy shave you get with them.</li>
    <li> My sister and I tried them a few years ago and got quite cut up.  While caring for my grandma, I ended up a little grocery store with very few options.  Reluctantly, I tried them again.  They kept catching my skin the first time I used them.  The second time I got to my room and saw streaks of blood down my legs, blood on my floor, blood on the bathroom floor and the tub...  I got a few bigger cuts and a ton of nicks.  My Venus razors glide smoothly, never catching, and almost never cut me.  I was late to an event due to trying to stop the blood and get everything clean.</li>
    <li> I love these razors they leave your legs so smooth and do not knick.  So much better than most disposables.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see so many good reviews! I tried these out for a few months, and although they have a nice, steady handle, the razors were more harm than they were help. It might be because I have sensitive skin, but every time I used them I got horrible razor burn/irritation. In addition to that, they frequently gave me nicks and cuts. I would not recommend these at all, unless you are looking for a quick throwaway and you don&#x27;t mind the pain.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for the value that they were and also because I was able to subscribe and save for them.</li>
    <li> I liked these razors better when they came with the pivoting head. The heads on these suckers are super stationary. Doesn&#x27;t get as close on all of leg curves.</li>
    <li> I thought these where the kind where the head swivels but I was disappointed. They were already dull and I could use them once.</li>
    <li> Literally one of the only shaving razors I will come back to again and again.</li>
    <li> I just bought these on here to get my order up to $35 for the free shipping and it&#x27;s actually the 6 pack because there are 2 bonus razors. What a great deal, plus, I love these razors anyway!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors ever, they seem to get every bit of stubble there is to be had.  My pits and legs are oh so smooth.  One problem, my rowdy teen age boys are always taking them.  They don&#x27;t have much hair on their face, so who knows what they do with the things, but they do seem to disappear rather quickly in my home.  I know one teenage son shaved one armpit, because his sisters dared him to.  He wanted to see how fast it would grow back.  I have to say this razor made his armpit smooth as a babys behind!</li>
    <li> I figured these would be a great razor but I now remember why I never bought them again.  They are dull and I couldn&#x27;t finish shaving my legs and no way would I use them on my underarms.  I would never give them to anyone else.  BIC products are cheap you get what you pay for so I ordered Schick and they are terrific.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they are not recyclable plastic. They are great razors however so its a catch 22</li>
    <li> Great price and how easy to not have to go to a store and stand in a line to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This razor&#x27;s blade assembly stays locked with the handle, instead of the \\&quot;pivot&#x27; type heads.  I get a lot of scrape and nicks with the pivot heads because they fail to match how I&#x27;ve already angled the handle.  Learned how to do that back in grade school, thank you, don&#x27;t need a hinged set a blades.</li>
    <li> These work well for guys and gals who want an inexpensive razor to only use a few times before tossing.</li>
    <li> the more blades, the more bumps/cuts it will create -- it shaved my legs perfectly - but I am on guard -- and so far so good -- If it gets bad --will revise my comments but so far so good</li>
    <li> My 13 yr. old daughter got her legs all ripped up by these things, even with using shaving cream. Not a good item, I&#x27;ll stick to the more expensive razors that don&#x27;t injure you.</li>
    <li> Always a staple razor to keep on hand. Good, reliable product.</li>
    <li> Great product makes your skin smooth and great seller</li>
    <li> I have been using these razors for years. They work really well and glide on your skin and give you a close shave but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with any nicks or cuts. The handle is easy to use and I just won&#x27;t switch now that I have found them.</li>
    <li> Horrible, worst razors ever! These leave stubble, and razor burns.</li>
    <li> A great razor. I&#x27;ve paid more for razers but I haven&#x27;t used a smoother one. Simple, a good deal, and it does the job well.</li>
    <li> Finally a razor that goes in the gym bag and stay sharp for ages....have no nicks from it either. A keeper.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors! I buy tons of them!</li>
    <li> This is a good value for the price. These Bic Soleil razors provide a close shave and do not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love these razors. They were delivered quickly. They do the job they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
    <li> I buy cheap razors it&#x27;s what I do, I don&#x27;t spend extra money on venus like I used to, I&#x27;m a super saver now.  However after buying these razors for a great price, I have gotten cut, razor burned etc and I shave with coconut oil/water.  They are only good for one leg.  I&#x27;ve used better cheaper razors than these I would not recommend these to save an extra buck.</li>
    <li> These have become my favorite disposable razor. They work excellent. No tugging or pulling for razor burns. Fantastic quality</li>
    <li> I use these all the Great price and how easy to not have to go to a store and stand in a line to purchase it. a real keeper. i use them every day with little to no maintenance. very sharp blades that are perfect for those sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Love these little disposable razors!</li>
    <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve used, and for the price even better!</li>
    <li> great shavers, will buy again.</li>
    <li> love this razor. It left my legs baby soft like no stubble and not prickly hairs left behind at all. I was truly amazed and would reccomend this razor to other women looking to get a super close shave :)</li>
    <li> Keeps My legs silky smooth.</li>
    <li> The first thing that stood out for me regarding this razor was the light, pleasant lavender scent. It was perfectly strong and not overpowering. The handle seems to be ergonomically designed. It is wider than most, making it easier to hold onto than razors with handles of uniform thickness. It also has a depressed spot with textured rings where your pointer finger goes, for that extra reassurance regarding grip. This is what you want in a slippery shower environment, making this an especially great choice for young women new to shaving!</li>
    <li> Great razors.  They don&#x27;t rust as easily as others.  Gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> These razors were horrible. I picked them up because they looked nice and were similar to another brand I usually get. Bad move. I&#x27;ve used almost the whole pack and every single time I shave with them I get cuts. I&#x27;ve never cut myself shaving before unless it was my hand slipping or something. When I used them today, I had at least 10 cuts covering my legs after I was done and blood was running down my legs. Would not recommend these at all.</li>
    <li> Cut my legs more than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried. It was painful to use too!! I couldn&#x27;t believe how many nicks I had when I used it-- awful!!! I have thick, coarse hair so maybe its not good for people with my hair type.</li>
    <li> As with all items on Amazon, there are always a few reviewers who trash the product.  I have used these razors for several years and have been happy with them.  Yes, if you aren&#x27;t careful about what you&#x27;re doing, you will cut yourself - I don&#x27;t know of any razor that won&#x27;t.  It really annoys me (can you tell?) when people blame the product rather than consider how they are using it.</li>
    <li> These razors just perfect.  They do not require any maintenance, good to use just from the box and last for a while or until you become bored with them and switch to another brand or method : ).  Excellent quality, look, smell and feel.</li>
    <li> I have tried all types of razors.  used the venus one for a long while.  These are cheaper, simpler and give me a real close shave.  bonus is that sometimes they come packed with an extra two razors like the pack i received from amazon.</li>
    <li> The twilight razor gave me a close, smooth shave on my legs. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and the lubricating strips left my legs razor bump free. Unlike other razors I&#x27;ve used that over lubricate and leave my legs slimy the twilight razor gave me a smooth shave without the slime. The one problem area I did find with this razor is when it came to my underarms I was unable to get a close shave. Instead of the nice smooth shave I had on my legs my underarms were left a little prickly. Overall I would still recommend the product because of the A+ job it did on my legs.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> These razors give a good shave and can be used - in my case - at least a half-dozen times.</li>
    <li> These are as good or better than Mach-3, etc. and half the price. If you don&#x27;t mind pink razors, you&#x27;ll save yourself plenty of money.</li>
    <li> Works nicely on both legs and underarms.  I use them all the time</li>
    <li> These razors work well and were a good price.  I have discovered that as you get older, you really need a razor that swivels, but these do a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> Great razors. Smooth and easy, like the handle grip and price compared to the other cheapy ones</li>
    <li> best deal around.great product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so these do the job just fine. However, I&#x27;ve also found that even cheaper razors (the kind you buy in bags of 12) work just as well. I would say these are probably not worth the money, if you have sensitive skin you should spring for better razors, if you don&#x27;t, then there&#x27;s no need for these either, just get the cheaper Bics.</li>
    <li> Worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I used 3 out of the pack to give them a good trial. I have the scars to prove it. I end up with multiple nicks/cuts every time I shave with these. AND they dull very quickly. They are by far the worst razors I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used cheap single blade razors that work better!</li>
