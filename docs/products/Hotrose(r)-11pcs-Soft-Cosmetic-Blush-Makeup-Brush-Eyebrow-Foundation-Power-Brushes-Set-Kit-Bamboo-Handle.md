<li> Almost a little too soft...</li>
<li> Very firm but soft brushes like fur.</li>
<li> One of my brushes arrived broken; the actual brush was disconnected from the handle, but they are very, very soft.</li>
<li> The ferrules are tight, the hairs never shed -- even I washed them.</li>
<li> A little fall out on the kabuki brush but just a little.</li>
<li> One of the kabuki foundation brush had the water and soap coming out from the base of the ferule when i squeezed the brush head which I&#x27;ve never seen before.  </li>

    <li> Absolutely outstanding brushes. These are soft as ever, but apply makeup so smoothly. I received my package earlier than expected and I was extremely pleased with how well packaged they were. Individually wrapped inside the cute tote bag, inside of plastic and inside of bubble wrapped envelope. The brushes didn&#x27;t even have that warehouse smell to them which I was pleased with. The ferrules are tight, the hairs never shed -- even I washed them. Impressed and highly recommend! Thinking of getting a second set!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Order this one. You will not  regret it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good actually👍</li>
    <li> You get for what you pay for.  The  first day i received them,  i washed them because i wanted to use them right away.  One of the kabuki foundation brush had the water and soap coming out from the base of the ferule when i squeezed the brush head which I&#x27;ve never seen before.  The flat foundation brush i use for concealer is a bit scratchy and pokes my face.  The other face brushes are pretty soft as well as the eye brushes But the eye brushes don&#x27;t pick up product so well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE them!! &amp; Shipping was also nice and fast!! 😊</li>
    <li> Very firm but soft brushes like fur. I&#x27;m very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use this set of brushes, but, looking and feeling the bristles,I would say it was made to serve it&#x27;s purpose. The Quality Looks good. The packaging was good when it came to my house.</li>
    <li> Beat brushes ever! No need to spend $40 for each brush at MAC!</li>
