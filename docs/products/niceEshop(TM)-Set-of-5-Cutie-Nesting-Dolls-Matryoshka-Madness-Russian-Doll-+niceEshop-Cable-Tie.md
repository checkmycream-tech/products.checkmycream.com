      <li>finish was cheap looking.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fit well together.  </li>
      <li>Cute and such a good price.</li>
      <li>When I came across these I was so excited.  </li>
      <li>Great price, but some pieces don&#x27;t fit each other as well as others.</li>
      <li>but it is still cool.</li>
      <li>My daughter loves these,and it was a good present at the holiday</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my granddaughter and she absolutely fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re gorgeous, well made, and they were only $7!  </li>
      <li>My daughter spotted a similar product at our doctor&#x27;s office and loved them</li>
      <li>I own several sets of these brought from Russia - they are easy to open, and my girls (2 and 7) love to play with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the price they r ok....they don&#x27;t fit together very well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s colorful and durable.</li>
      <li>I HOPE IT IS WORTH WAITING</li>
      <li>Also they fit into each other nicely.</li>
      <li>Painted nice and they all fit well within each other.</li>
      <li>We didn&#x27;t quite figure out how to stack them, but they love opening and finding each next size inside until they get to the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>But, they are exactly what she wanted.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to open it.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what i needed for my youth retreat.  </li>
      <li>These are very cute for the price and similar to the more expensive ones I used to own.</li>
      <li>It still looks cute for the low price and my kids play with it.</li>
      <li>They are very nicely painted and a rather cute set, but a couple times I was afraid of breaking them, they were so stuck</li>
      <li>All my life I have wanted Nesting dolls and when I found these at a reasonable price I grabbed them</li>
      <li>I had to get a vise grip and really work them to pull apart.</li>
      <li>he wants to take them home with him.</li>
      <li>One doll doesn&#x27;t close very well</li>
      <li>Very sloopy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Wanted to try this one, and my 2 year old got excited when she saw it, but she could not open one of the dolls.</li>
      <li>will provide many hours of fun&lt;br /&gt;For this little girl.  </li>
      <li>You get what you pay for they were rough and cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I am new nesting doll collector.</li>
      <li>but for a few bucks it was worth it to see them smile.</li>
      <li>The first set only has 3 dolls not 5 as advertised.</li>
      <li>I purchased this old fashioned doll set for a friends granddaughter who is three years old.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(probably would not have bought them) but my three year old loves them, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old loves playing with them.</li>
      <li>it was a treat to open up the mystery package, It brought a big smile to my face knowing my little guy would be so excited to get them.</li>
      <li>This set of nesting dolls is cute, but the dolls are warped and are not easy for a child to take apart and put back together.</li>
      <li>2 year old twin grandaughters love these, but must be supervised while playing with them as the smallest is very small.</li>
      <li>When I had spent the money on a true Russian set.</li>
      <li>My little granddaugthers will love this and at such a low cost, no one will be concerned if pieces get lost!  </li>
      <li>Some of the dolls fall apart too easy while others are too hard to pull apart.  </li>
      <li>I have a special little 4 year old who just loves taking these apart and putting them all back together.</li>
      <li>When they finally came apart, after much effort, they would not go back...</li>
      <li>other thing is it came directly from China, and I am not sure what kids of inspection it went thru in terms of paint being safe.</li>
      <li>They are a little tight at first, but after the constant opening, they open easily for her now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was extremely reasonable in cost, is painted very carefully,</li>

    <li> It was okay but the packaging came with a broken piece and I was gonna return it but I don&#x27;t have money sorry :(</li>
    <li> My son fell in love with these at the doctor&#x27;s office, I totally forgot i had ordered them,  it was a treat to open up the mystery package, It brought a big smile to my face knowing my little guy would be so excited to get them. Great quality for the price. Dolls did not stick, all of them opened up nicely.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wish I could tell you these were great but I have been waiting and waiting and they are still not here. Was hoping to give these to a little girl for Xmas but that plan has been foiled!</li>
    <li> My little granddaugthers will love this and at such a low cost, no one will be concerned if pieces get lost!  We didn&#x27;t quite figure out how to stack them, but they love opening and finding each next size inside until they get to the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34;.  They come from China so expect a wait on the mailing but mine arrived before the promised deadline.</li>
    <li> Good item, except that the paint sticks and then the dolls are impossible to break apart.  I had to get a vise grip and really work them to pull apart.</li>
    <li> My niece loves it and she toddled around with the &amp;#34; baby &amp;#34; in her little hand for days after receiving this for Christmas !</li>
    <li> Cute and such a good price. Great value! Daughter liked it.  Painted nice and they all fit well within each other.</li>
    <li> All my life I have wanted Nesting dolls and when I found these at a reasonable price I grabbed them and they are gorgeous</li>
    <li> This set of nesting dolls is cute, but the dolls are warped and are not easy for a child to take apart and put back together.</li>
    <li> For the price they r ok....they don&#x27;t fit together very well.  I have a collection of amazing nesting dolls, so I got these for my daughter to play with instead of my collector ones....but she can&#x27;t even open them....</li>
    <li> I had to return this  - very poor quality. I own several sets of these brought from Russia - they are easy to open, and my girls (2 and 7) love to play with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to try this one, and my 2 year old got excited when she saw it, but she could not open one of the dolls. I could not either. My husband had to do it. Couple are hard to open, and couple are too loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is it came directly from China, and I am not sure what kids of inspection it went thru in terms of paint being safe. For a toy my child will be holding in her hands a lot - safety is a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was very nice and accommodating through return process. Excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt bad returning it for this kind of price, but I had to.</li>
    <li> This is soo cute, I have always wanted one of these and I can&#x27;t wait to get it open. i will be buying others.</li>
    <li> My niece has been begging for these nesting dolls for years and I finally gave in and bought her these. She said it was her favorite birthday gift so I guess she really liked them. These dolls are unique and are great quality for the price they were.</li>
    <li> The delivery took weeks! I would not recommend this product. It&#x27;s poorly made. Not worth the a dime. Save your money.</li>
    <li> One doll doesn&#x27;t close very well but it is still cool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted my own set of nesting dolls.  I remember my great grandmother having a set in her home.  When I came across these I was so excited.  They&#x27;re gorgeous, well made, and they were only $7!  My 5yo daughter can&#x27;t stop playing with them!  I may need to get another set!</li>
    <li> Great price, but some pieces don&#x27;t fit each other as well as others. Kids still like and play with them</li>
    <li> Looks great.  These are exactly what i needed for my youth retreat.  Arrived before they said they would. Love them.</li>
    <li> 2 year old twin grandaughters love these, but must be supervised while playing with them as the smallest is very small.</li>
    <li> These were a very good price and are of good quality. These remind me of the ones we played with as little kids.</li>
    <li> not good quality painting.  Very sloopy.  Had to sand running paint and repaint and varnish. would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The quality for the price was clearly a pleasant experience. My daughter loves these,and it was a good present at the holiday</li>
    <li> Very cute! Sometimes they are hard for my 6 year old to get apart. But, they are exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I have a special little 4 year old who just loves taking these apart and putting them all back together. I have to get another because he every time he comes to visit he wants to take them home with him. I keep telling him, &amp;#34;If you take it home it won&#x27;t be here when you come to visit and you won&#x27;t be able to play with them.&amp;#34; So he will be very excited to take one home and have one at Grammy&#x27;s!!! These are just adorable!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughter for Christmas but we didn&#x27;t receive them until almost the end of January. However she was glad to get them as she&#x27;s been wanting them for a while and I was glad to be able to get them on here. They were just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for they were rough and cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I purchased this old fashioned doll set for a friends granddaughter who is three years old.&lt;br /&gt;My friend who is ill said this was her favorite toy growing up.&lt;br /&gt;It was extremely reasonable in cost, is painted very carefully, and I&#x27;m  sure will provide many hours of fun&lt;br /&gt;For this little girl.  Arrived in perfect condition. So happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price. Shipping does take a few weeks but it said that would be the case.  Like many low priced nesting dolls they were difficult to open.</li>
    <li> My daughter spotted a similar product at our doctor&#x27;s office and loved them so I ordered them for her. They are a little tight at first, but after the constant opening, they open easily for her now.</li>
    <li> cheaply made, but also cheap in price.  I purchased two different ones at different times.  The first set was impossible to get apart, so we put a little wax on them.  the second ones never wanted to stay together.  but for a few bucks it was worth it to see them smile.</li>
    <li> All the piecies fit nicely and great quality</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my granddaughter.  She loves them!! The price couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I purchased these nesting dolls because they were very cheap and I lost some nesting dolls I had when I last moved. These are very cute for the price and similar to the more expensive ones I used to own.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a set my 4 year old grandchild could play with ~ this works perfectly. It&#x27;s colorful and durable.</li>
    <li> They are very nicely painted and a rather cute set, but a couple times I was afraid of breaking them, they were so stuck together.&lt;br /&gt;The next to the last doll was so stuck, I had to use a razor to carefully recut and pry apart.</li>
    <li> Pretty design but dolls are so tight its nearly impossible to separate. Got these as a Christmas gift for a 7 year old &amp; she is so sad that she can&#x27;t play with them. Needless to say we are disappointed!! Probably take it to the desert with us next time we go shooting! lol</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Buy!  They are painted shut.  When they finally came apart, after much effort, they would not go back...Couldn&#x27;t put Cutie back together again.  Got refund.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know they would be traveling all the way from China (probably would not have bought them) but my three year old loves them, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> these are ruff feeling and nor well made but for the price who can complain. kids still love nesting them over and over.</li>
    <li> as  advertised --- an inexpensive set; ideal gift for grandaughter.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t painted well.  It didn&#x27;t fit well together.  The wood cracked.</li>
    <li> I was not as pleased with these because they were painted shut.  I will have to get them open without peeling the paint off.</li>
    <li> Love these, but I did have to wax the ver edge so i could get them apart</li>
    <li> These are very pretty and the kids love them.  A beautiful paint job, very feminine.  Also they fit into each other nicely.</li>
    <li> Some of the dolls fall apart too easy while others are too hard to pull apart.  You can sand off the inside of the doll for those that are too tight but those that are too loose cannot be fixed.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter, she saw some in a store for $40.00 and said she would like some for Christmas, found these for an awesome price and they are so cute and she loves them!</li>
    <li> suppose to be a set of 5 nesting dolls and the set that same only had 4 nesting dolls.  the missing one is the small one that doesn&#x27;t open</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter and she absolutely fell in love with it.  She is only 4-years-old and just loves to take them apart and put them back together.  It entertains her for hours.  I rated this item because of the entertainment value.  The quality of the item is perfect for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Some of the dolls are so loose they won&#x27;t stay closed and others are almost impossible to open.  When I had spent the money on a true Russian set.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS ON DECEMBER 11TH.....IT IS NOW JAN. 16TH.....I HOPE IT IS WORTH WAITING THIS LONG FOR....IF NOT, BACK IT GOES....</li>
    <li> i dont know why but they are so cute i love them the are small but its ok&lt;br /&gt;the big one is about the size of my hand.</li>
    <li> They are warped , and don&#x27;t fit together.. Very cheap!! My daughter is four andd had a hard time opening an closing them... we were so excited then disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets. The first set only has 3 dolls not 5 as advertised. The 2nd one I have been trying to open for days.&lt;br /&gt;and its.glued together or something. I haven&#x27;t been able to open it. I have not contacted the seller because I havent&lt;br /&gt;Found a link to do that.for them.not sadisfied.with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Updatte sellers asks for photos to be sent sent photo and have not heard back from them so I emailed them again another letter and still no responce back. 3/9//14&lt;br /&gt;I received replacement and they are great.</li>
    <li> Cute!! Great price for this set if nesting dolls. Well made. Going to buy another set to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old loves playing with them.Just ordered another set.Shipped exactactly to the day and looked just like the picture.</li>
    <li> - they just are terrible, that company should send two to replace the junk dolls they sent me.  One too big and floppy, dolls fall off each other- One so tight adults struggle to take apart- Got these for granddaughters- they wont play with them.  Waste of money and so much time.</li>
    <li> The last piece is still inside the 4th one  and too tight to open. One of the dolls fell down and now its cracked. It still looks cute for the low price and my kids play with it.</li>
    <li> It did take a long time to arrive but I guess it was expected.  If getting for a gift be sure to take that into account.</li>
    <li> I am new nesting doll collector.</li>
    <li> My grandchildren love it.</li>
    <li> finish was cheap looking. It has glitter on it, and I was unable to open the largest doll to see the others inside.</li>
