      <li>I just wish I could find the EXACT product in a larger, more economical tube!?</li>
      <li>and I do love the small, precision tip, and these are in smaller travel size, great to toss into travel kit.</li>
      <li>Just the thing for those times when your \\&quot;pearly whites\\&quot; start wandering around in your mouth and leaving gaps for coarse ground pepper to reside in and make your mouth interesting for some time.  </li>
      <li>Great little invention!!!  </li>
      <li>that seem to make it less effective.</li>

      <li>I purchased this for an older relative.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really need the adhesive factor, but a little bit of this compound does a great job of sealing against those uncomfortable nuisance items.</li>
      <li>I hate my dentures but gotta deal with them the best way possible.</li>
      <li>PLEASE make Plain Food Seal available in larger tubes</li>
      <li>u shouldn&#x27;t pay no more than $6.00 for a pack of 3.Be very careful many sellers will try to overcharge for a 3pk.</li>
      <li>These small, travel size tubes are much easier to apply the small amount needed than the larger tubes commonly available in pharmacies.</li>
      <li>It works but not extremely well, fixodent didn&#x27;t last as long as it stated</li>

<li> This is the only place u can buy the small tubes of fixadent.</li>
<li> about $20 per ounce with other size tubes</li>
<li> then it used to be in other stores.</li>
<li> This is a very convenient size, but it has become increasingly difficult to find.</li>
<li> I guess I should have paid a little closer attention to the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I like to have these little tubes for my purse and the glove compartment in the car.</li>
<li> A little overpriced, but the only game in town.</li>
<li> Tho not practical for everyday use.</li>
<li> You can buy 3 of the 2 oz tubes for the same amount of money if not less than what I paid for this :(</li>
<li> like the small tubes for carrying in my purse and prefer the small nozzle which is used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued in this size....price was high but love the size</li>
    <li> I love these little travel size Fixodents. They&#x27;re the perfect size for my purse. These are just as important in my purse as my billfold is.</li>
    <li> I have been using Fixodent for years and have been unable to find the small tubes in any local store.  It is great for taking with you in case you might need it while you are out.  Great that Amazon was able to find it.</li>
    <li> I am new to denture adhesives and have found the FIxodent is an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve purchases the small tubes to carry with me when I am traveling.  They work very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for an older relative.  The tubes are great for traveling, and the product works well.  He is satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for many years and have never had any problems. I recommend it. You will love it!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for a quick seal at the end of the day when dentures start to loosen up.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find the small sized Fixodent with food seal tip.  My husband was very happy to get these.</li>
    <li> this product is great to bring with you, any where you go.  It is small, so very easy to carry in your pocket.  Great for on the go people, even good at work.</li>
    <li> Thank God I found a place to purchase this item (Fixodent).  My husband and I looked all over and found it nowhere.  Walgrens  did sell it but they took it off the shelves.  We use it because of the product itself and also the distribution size of the tube.  It is perfect and works so well for us.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my husband since he likes the smaller item and can&#x27;t seem to find the small ones in the stores here in Mansfield, Ohio.  He obviously likes the product and he received it almost immediately.  I will order these again for him, as needed.  I ordered 3 packs, so they will last awhile since he uses the larger product when at home.</li>
    <li> Got these for  Mother, She has issues with her dentures all of the time. She uses this at home and on the go. She always has one in her purse for when we go out.</li>
    <li> This product and size work extremely well for my dentures.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for being on the road. Aldo I always keep one in the car</li>
    <li> This is one of those \\&quot;trivial\\&quot; little products that make life more pleasant. My partial lower denture has the unpleasant habit of collecting things like strawberry and blueberry seeds and the cereals I like to eat for breakfast. I don&#x27;t really need the adhesive factor, but a little bit of this compound does a great job of sealing against those uncomfortable nuisance items. These small, travel size tubes are much easier to apply the small amount needed than the larger tubes commonly available in pharmacies.</li>
    <li> I purchased this size specifically for my elderly father.  He is able to control this size and slip in his pocket better than the regular sized tube.  Amazon is the only place around here that I can purchase it!  I&#x27;ll continue to be a customer to this vendor.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and great service on recieving it. it is very hard to find this product in this size anymore so this was a great find.</li>
    <li> fast and no problem. super happy. needed the product for my uncle. he lives in Switzerland and I needed it fast.&lt;br /&gt;awesome job. no problem</li>
    <li> My partner loves these as they are easy to take along on trips or out to dinner.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> Stuff works great and I do love the small, precision tip, and these are in smaller travel size, great to toss into travel kit.</li>
    <li> like the small tubes for carrying in my purse and prefer the small nozzle which is used.</li>
    <li> They work great in a pocket or a purse.</li>
    <li> the Fixodent size is great.. the price outrageous...  I thought there was more than one package for this price...total rip off.</li>
    <li> A little overpriced, but the only game in town.</li>
    <li> This sample size pricing has gone through the roof. Will not order again</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a small amount you get for the price you pay.  When I opened the package, I was shocked at the size of the tube.  I&#x27;ll buy elsewhere next time.  Not thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> OMG!I was so excited to find Fixodent Control To Go on Amazon.com. I have tried to find this product everywhere to no avail.  I ordered several Packs of this product and now my dentures are loose free. I am now hooked on Amazon.com The small tubes of this product fit in my purse and are easy to carry. Sharon in Texas</li>
    <li> Not a lot of ooze and holds well</li>
    <li> Why not put this good product in a larger tube?  Better then any other I have tried..</li>
    <li> It works but not extremely well, fixodent didn&#x27;t last as long as it stated it wouldn my crown came back off within an hour</li>
    <li> This is the only place u can buy the small tubes of fixadent. If u hav dentures, r out &amp; need to smile @ someone after eating ( sometimes ur Dr tires tend to come loose). Who wants to carry the large tube, I work 12-14 hrs &amp; need to carry fixadent w me.</li>
    <li> Like this product because you can carry it in your pocket, and it doesn&#x27;t stick out like a tennis ball.</li>
    <li> on dentures - but truth it was more expensive then it used to be in other stores. Sorry the price should be for 3 more.</li>
    <li> can hardly find these any more I hope fixodent comes out with more of these.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t last thru a meal The food particles got underneath. I also don&#x27;t likr the fact that it has zinc in it.</li>
    <li> Did I ever get ripped off on this. Love the small size and was flummoxed by the price. Turns out I found the small tubes today at CVS for $2.75 each. Amazon ought to take this item off the site. RIPOFF.</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient size, but it has become increasingly difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Price per ounce is ridiculous. Convenience is great.... but the cost effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;is crazy..about $20 per ounce with other size tubes it is about  $1. How can anyone&lt;br /&gt;justify this out of line pricing? A consumer ripoff.</li>
    <li> I was shocked by the size and the price I paid for this size. These are trial size tubes maybe 3&amp;#34; in length which includes the cap. Thinking this is highway robbery. I guess I should have paid a little closer attention to the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for product itself, it is the best.</li>
    <li> Does not work any better than any other version.</li>
    <li> I love this .35oz. size it is so convenient and easy to carry in pockets and purses also easy to be so discreet w/ in public as well. But for all of u that like it u may want to stock up on some because it has been discontinued.U will no longer be able to find it at Walmart or any drugstores, Amazon and Ebay are the only places to find it now, but their supplies is running low too.&lt;br /&gt; Ebay.com seems to have the best prices with Free Shipping too, u shouldn&#x27;t pay no more than $6.00 for a pack of 3.Be very careful many sellers will try to overcharge for a 3pk. and also will charge a hefty fee for shipping as well. I wish Procter and Gamble will read these post to see how much people love this convenient size, hopefully they will bring it back on the market sometimes in the near future. Happy New Year to all.</li>
    <li> Fixodent is one of two products that I use to secure my dentures.  Works well and I will continue to use it,</li>
    <li> I like to have these little tubes for my purse and the glove compartment in the car. They are great for on the go</li>
    <li> It is great it holds like none of the others and there is no taste afterwards of putting in your mouth</li>
    <li> Are great to have to carry when traveling</li>
    <li> easy to take with you and easy to handle, unfortunately this size seems to be discontinued...i have arthris and this is easier to handle, hopefully it will come back</li>
    <li> Quality product, quality service.</li>
    <li> This size is so handy. I can take it anywhere- in my pocket when canoeing or hiking, in my beach bag, and my purse. Fixodent is a great product. Now it is travel friendly.</li>
    <li> We were already a fan of the product.  We purchased the smaller sizes because of needing to downsize our &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; when traveling on the motorcycle.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but after using the Fixodent with Scope I asked myself why isn&#x27;t scope with these also. I know that all denture users know what I meen, its always nice to have the extra knowledge that you don&#x27;t have to worry about denture odor.</li>
    <li> This Food Seal is the BEST denture adhesive I have found! I just wish I could find the EXACT product in a larger, more economical tube!? It seems the larger tubes all have some other product &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34;  (like Scope, etc.) that seem to make it less effective. C&#x27;mon Fixodent! Don&#x27;t keep changing when U already have the BEST! Guess will have to keep buying the tiny &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34; tubes. Tho not practical for everyday use. PLEASE make Plain Food Seal available in larger tubes</li>
    <li> My husband has plates and these are so convenient for him -he just leaves one at work - one in the car - and he usually tries to carry one with him in his pocket - that way he is covered where ever he is.  Great little invention!!!  Nothing more embarrassing or uncomfortable than not having your plates fit securely!!!!  I always try to keep him with at least one set of these at all times - since he keeps a full size tube at home - these always last him a good long time - and I know that  he is always covered where ever he goes!!!! Also these are hard to find in your brick and mortar stores and when you do find them they are usually a lot pricier than what you pay here!!</li>
    <li> I hate my dentures but gotta deal with them the best way possible. The big or regular size tubes were kind of bulky to carry around in my purse, but these tuck in almost anywhere in a purse, glove box, pencil holder...where ever.  Convenient to use and of course, the usual fixodent quality.</li>
    <li> i love this product but i can not find it in the stores!  i think the vendor discontinued. perfect size !</li>
    <li> Shipping was Fast and was New In Package like they said, This is nice because you can carry it in your pocket and the lid does Not come off. It is a very fast fix if you are in the middle of dinner and need a Quick fix, GOD BLESS</li>
    <li> Great for travel if you have partial or full dentures</li>
    <li> It was awfully expensive for the 3 1 oz tubes. You can buy 3 of the 2 oz tubes for the same amount of money if not less than what I paid for this :(</li>
    <li> Good stuff:  These are pocket size tubes of denture adhesive.  Just the thing for those times when your \\&quot;pearly whites\\&quot; start wandering around in your mouth and leaving gaps for coarse ground pepper to reside in and make your mouth interesting for some time.  Now you can remove, rinse, and reapply in certainty that they&#x27;ll stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad stuff:  This can ONLY be ordered in addition to something else you have ordered.  You cannot JUST order a three-pack of pocket sized denture adhesive, it has to be ordered with something else worth more than $25.00 before packing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I was only getting 3 tubes for 23.99.  I think this price is outrageous. I won&#x27;t b buying this again.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the small size Fixodent Control To Go Denture Adhesive Cream Triple Pack 1.05 Oz for travel ease and convience</li>
    <li> There alway seems a time or two that your dentures come loose especially while having a meal.  Thee are nice an convienent to carry i your pocket and extrude just a small amount a needed.  It has saveded me several times,  Thank again.</li>
