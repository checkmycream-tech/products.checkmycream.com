<li> This stuff does last a very long time.  </li>
<li> This is the bigger size, but it doesn&#x27;t have the adjustable plastic cover inside that slides closed to keep excess powder from sneaking out and into the part where the lid is.</li>
<li> I mix a little Glee in with my foundation for a hint of overall color.  </li>
<li> I usually forget to pay attention to the sizes when ordering my bare minerals.</li>
<li> This is getting harder to find in the stores and I appreciate finding it on Amazon!</li>
<li> Usually other tones are too brown or orange on me.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few years</li>
<li> so you use very little</li>
<li> It is very difficult to get any product on the brush.</li>

    <li> Glee is exactly the right color to use as a blush or highlighter, and has the good quality mineral makeup of all of the bare escentuals line.</li>
    <li> Love this color. This is the bigger size, but it doesn&#x27;t have the adjustable plastic cover inside that slides closed to keep excess powder from sneaking out and into the part where the lid is. Not a major issue, but would have liked to have known this. I didn&#x27;t deduct a star for this bc it&#x27;s still amazing the way it is.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time and it works well for me.  Takes a bit more time to apply, but worth the extra effort.</li>
    <li> This is one of my absolute favorite colors put out by Bare Minerals!  I like natural blush colors.  This is getting harder to find in the stores and I appreciate finding it on Amazon! I have sensitive skin and skin allergies.  I can use mineral type makeup with no problems.</li>
    <li> I usually forget to pay attention to the sizes when ordering my bare minerals. This is huge. Glee is my favorite and has Been for years.</li>
    <li> I have used their bronzers before and purchased this one because I could not find the one I had used on Amazon. It is very difficult to get any product on the brush. I have tried crushing it but that didn&#x27;t help. I tried wetting my brush and that seemed to work the best. There are no directions for application that come with this. I personally would not buy this again, although I love Bare Escentual products.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best face colors ever.  I had to stop using this because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, but am back now and will stay back since I can get from Amazon.  I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Live it! Part of my daily routine🌞perks me right up! Would not be without it! A must have!!!!!! Try it!</li>
    <li> I need fair tone based foundations most seasons. Usually other tones are too brown or orange on me. I have blue eyes and white hair.  I mix a little Glee in with my foundation for a hint of overall color.  Or I brush the glee lightly on my upper cheeks and eyelids.  This is a mauvy blush so you use very little and it is more natural than pink blush on me.</li>
    <li> This cheek color is a fabulous color, high quality, and comes in a reasonably sized container.  Will repurchase and recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I have used Bare Escentuals for many years now and love it.  So many of their products are gluten free and I love that about them.  Couldn&#x27;t use them if they weren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> love this product- great price</li>
    <li> Glee is a nice blush from Bare Minerals, Bare Escentuals.  This is one of the large jars of mineral blush, and should last me over a year.  The price was under that of the  manufacturer&#x27;s website, and the shipping was free.</li>
    <li> On my skin tone this is a true &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; color-it is red and needs to be applied on my fair skin lightly, but I think it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve ever found to looking like a natural flush of color.</li>
    <li> I have ONLY always used Bare Minerals ...I have VERY, VERY sensitive skin so their make-up is the ONLY brand that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;I have NOTHING but GREAT things to say about all of the Bare Minerals essentials!</li>
    <li> in finding this color.  Seems that I&#x27;ve been looking for &amp;#34;Glee&amp;#34; forever and I thank you for selling this nice, large amount.  The color is perfect for my very fair skin.  Layers well, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent all over face color.  Very light.  I love the Bare Escentuals line of products.</li>
    <li> The color Glee is perfect.  I will purchase again one day when I run out. This stuff does last a very long time.  Shipped quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I love glee by Bare Minerals.  It is a perfect color for my cheeks; not to dark and not to red.  I have been using this product for a few years and I recommend it if you want a product that will last for months.</li>
