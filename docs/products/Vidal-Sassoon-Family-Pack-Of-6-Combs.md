<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I needed some combs for my one year old daughter who has long crazy hair. This cheap pack is great so that now I have a comb in all my purses and bags just in case we need one!</li>
    <li> The quality its okay and it does bring 6, but they were a bit small for me.&lt;br /&gt;and they feel and look a bit cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always losing combs, so I&#x27;m hoping this set will last me awhile. I know that the ones with small handles are going to fit nicely in my mom&#x27;s old pencil holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have gotten ten different items for $5, but I liked this selection a little better, even if I paid a slightly higher &amp;#34;per comb&amp;#34; rate.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re combs. At this price, they do as expected. I have had none of them break on me yet and use one of them daily.</li>
    <li> Quality combs with variety. I use a couple of them for my beard and a couple for head. They work well. Like having a few options at a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Great comb set.  Nice combs for all kinds of uses.</li>
    <li> Big selection of combs. It&#x27;s nice to have a large pack like this if you have kids that are constantly losing the combs and hair brushes. Inexpensive too.</li>
    <li> It does the job and is cheap.  What else is there to ask for.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my kids on a whim.  They are excellent.  The manufacturer used more plastic than other comb makers, which makes them stronger.  My kids like them because the combs don&#x27;t bend when used.  I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great for the price - They aren&#x27;t the highest of quality, but that&#x27;s not what you are buying here. It&#x27;s a functional set of decent combs, of a wide variety. Note, the colors I received were different than advertised (The pink comb was actually brown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good buy for $3.50</li>
    <li> I was thinking because of the price for these combs, they would be flimsy and cheap but I ended up totally impressed. They are durable enough for my thick hair and I am thoroughly excited to use these every day.  I love the different colors as well, and that they are multipurpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I just purchased them for the first, I don&#x27;t have any history behind using them, I don&#x27;t know if they will last a really long time, but from the looks of it, it is promising.</li>
    <li> They are combs. They are different shapes and sizes. They look like the picture. They are plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The make your hair look nice.&lt;br /&gt;What else would you want to know?</li>
    <li> Just like the title says, these are combs not really any way you can mess these up. I guess you can make them without teeth or make them out of paper but if you did that then they really wouldn&#x27;t be combs and would not have come up when you searched for combs</li>
    <li> First thing is first: I bought this product for occasional use (put the styler one with handle to my locker room at gym, one pocket comb to my car and the other to my office etc). I think this product is not for  every day use. If you are looking a reliable product for every day use this is NOT for you, go buy ACE or some other brand product. For occasional use this is more than enough. I am very happy with the product, it actually well-exceed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It has 2x 5 inch pocket comb (black), 1x 7 inch pocket-purse all-porpuse comb (blue) 1x 7 inch wide tooth purse comb (grey), 1x dresser comb(maroon) and 1x tail comb(green). Colors may vary - I write according to product picture.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Price, price and price: I bought this for only 2 bucks and it has 6 combs - Like a joke.&lt;br /&gt;+ It has 2x pocket comb - which is perfect since you can put one to your pocket one to some other place. Or just use it as a spare one.&lt;br /&gt;+ It has 5 different type for every type of use&lt;br /&gt;+ Teeth of the pocket combs are fine and narrow enough for good shaping. I do not like wide teeth, since they are not shaping hair enough&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Quality- as expected the combs not seem to be very durable. I will update this post if somethings happen to them. But on bright side, all of them are just 2 bucks. Just throw away if smt happens. Actually, seeing the price I was expecting lower quality. Its quaility well exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;- Dresser comb and tail comb is smaller than the usual ones.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;If you use these for occasional uses, do not miss this product. For 2 bucks how much can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> These are for my toddler.  A comb is a comb.  Cheap enough so that if you lose one here and there it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> These combs are  joke.  They are so small.  My daughter has long very  thick hair and you can barely hold on to them. you would bebetter off buying a packet of combs at walgreens. I recommend these to anyone who plays with  babydolls.</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this product not only for the great quality of the combs but also for the variety of combs this pack has.</li>
    <li> Cheap for what you get. Thanks</li>
    <li> Not to bad nice to have an assortment none have broken and it use them every day and they are pretty durable</li>
    <li> these are so small they could only be for a baby. i didn&#x27;t realize how small these would be i can&#x27;t use any of them.</li>
    <li> I think these are good quality combs.  Also, at this price, it was just a good buy over all.  I had to do an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; to get $25 free shipping and it worked out since I&#x27;m always either losing combs or needing extra.  Worth the couple dollar add on.</li>
    <li> I ordered one few months ago, liked it so much that I ordered a second one after misplacing one of the black pocket combs.&lt;br /&gt;for being this in-expensive, it is not a cheap quality product. The teeth are comfortable on your skin or scalp. It&#x27;s gentle enough that we have been using these for our baby and he doesn&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for my beard when it got long and messy (still under and inch), but mostly use it for the head. It gives your hair nice shiny health look even if they were dry looking and tangled before your started.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone, I have used pretty much all of the combs that were in the pack and I am very happy with what you get for the price, so much so that I bought a second set just because. and its an add on item but Amazon sent it to me separate package both times, even thought the other items that I had in the cart came in one box. (not that it matters) but I think Amazon should removed the add on item tag from this.</li>
    <li> now my granddaughters can have their own combs at grandma&#x27;s house.  and they are different colors so nobody argues about whose is which.  if you have a similar situation, this is the set you need.</li>
    <li> Always a plus in my home. Everyone is always asking if I have a comb wen they lose theirs! (big family). I couldn&#x27;t find these packs anywhere! (anymore)?</li>
    <li> Love these combs. I was looking for inexpensive combs. These are great quality combs and very durable!  Just as described, I don&#x27;t think any one can complain about it. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The combs are a nice quality for the money.  They are all sturdy and durable.  I would recommend just to have them around and have extras.</li>
    <li> I bought this because between the wife and the kid I was bound to lose half of them. I was right. They work as described. Good value.</li>
    <li> Everything about the shipping was excellent. The combs were a disappointment. I bought them specifically to get a red comb, as was promised in the product description, but none of the combs are red.</li>
    <li> just as advertised, nice comb set, really can&#x27;t go wrong with these, standard, old-fashioned, basic product. Yet, surprisingly necessary amidst all the technological marvels in so many other areas of life!</li>
    <li> I only bought these as an add-on. They really aren&#x27;t very good, but they are inexpensive. So, it really is up to you.</li>
    <li> Very worth it for the price and the amount of combs all in one</li>
    <li> The combs are good, the packs has a lot of variety, and it is super cheap. Exactly what you would expect from this kind of deal.</li>
    <li> Great price and works as intended.</li>
    <li> The combs are of bit above average combs you can find in dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;The cheap combs could be given to kids and get lost without much bereavement.&lt;br /&gt;What more can one say, it is cheap combs available through 2 day shipping.</li>
    <li> For some reason my combs mysteriously vanish whenever I need one. At this price, I&#x27;ve learned to just stock up and I&#x27;ll never have to go looking for another comb again. Bravo Mr. Sassoon and your brilliantly cheap plastic!</li>
    <li> Solid durable combs in a variety of shapes and sizes. Months after this purchase, they are still holding up well. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for toddler hair! Works great! I have no idea why these were so hard to find in stores, but thanks again Amazon for making it easy to find products here!</li>
    <li> This is an extremely well priced item. The combs are not cheaply made and have lasted me a long time. The colors I got were a bit different than the ones pictured- they are better. I didn&#x27;t get any black combs.</li>
    <li> This product serves my purpose and comes in variety. I&#x27;m not sure which comb does what, but I just use them one by one and clean them as I go through each one of them. They are light and great to use when styling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was a day late, but I doubt the seller had anything to do with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack of combs for the wide tooth one on the far left in the photo. It is a good purse size and works well. The other combs are smaller tooth and hard for me to use so I gave some to my husband and the rest to someone else. They are pleased with them. They work as a comb should. I don&#x27;t know how long they last as I just got them but they seem like a normal comb.</li>
    <li> These are the best combs money can buy! Not really, they&#x27;re just combs. Which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great for guests, dogs and anyone else that needs a comb.</li>
    <li> basic combs, good price</li>
    <li> does the job for an excellent price, a comb for everyone in the house hold</li>
    <li> My comb broke and I needed a new one. I mainly use combs to part my hair in a straight line. I bought these because there were a variety of different kinds and I wanted to find what worked best for my hair. They&#x27;re sturdy, well-made and do the job. I&#x27;m very pleased with the value I got for the price. The colors I got were different than the advertised colors (I imagine the colors vary) but I don&#x27;t care at all. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> A few of them were a bit smaller than expected, but they are a great set of combs for the price. They don&#x27;t have those sharp teeth that you sometimes find on cheap combo packs of combs. They are excellent quality - would definitely purchase more!</li>
    <li> Slowly, my supply of combs has broken and I was left with only two, and the teeth on them were falling out.  I looked in a large (REALLY large) pharmacy and they didn&#x27;t have a set of combs like this!  Amazing.  The single combs that they had were made of plastic and didn&#x27;t look like they were of very good quality, not to mention the ridiculous price on just one comb. So I turned to my best retailing friend, Amazon, once again for something I couldn&#x27;t find in a store.  These combs appear to be made of nylon or vinyl rather than plastic, which is exactly what I wanted.  They have a forgiving flexibility to them that you don&#x27;t find in plain plastic combs which, to me, means that they will last longer than what I could find in the drugstore.  I realy like the assortment and while I may not use them all, when one of my grandchildren visits and forgets a comb, I&#x27;ll have one clean and ready to give out.  These are great combs at a great price that won&#x27;t disappoint you.  What a shame that they can&#x27;t be found locally!  Don&#x27;t people use plain combs anymore?</li>
    <li> I was thinking of buying a new come for myself and figured I can always give the extra combs to my sisters and niece.</li>
    <li> Love these! can never have enough!</li>
    <li> Great assortment of combs, great price. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of combs from a good brand and at nice cheap price! I use combs a lot, (dont like brushes they make my already frizzy hair frizzier). I really love how many different types of combs this set came with they are not flimsy as ive had them for a while and none have broke.</li>
    <li> Love all the combs!  My dog already got ahold of 2 of them, and I loved this pack so much I think I&#x27;ll buy another to replace them!  Good buy, good value.</li>
    <li> Good product at the right price</li>
    <li> Wow these combs are inexpensive and I love them. This is a great deal. They are great and are smooth to comb hair and each comb has separate color. All of us have their own combs and we avoid using other combs and what else can I say they are basic and works perfectly. I also have an extra comb in each car. I definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> They are a little thinner &amp; more flexible than the last package I bought a decade ago, but they will do the job.  I&#x27;d rather they had only one of the smallest black combs that no one uses &amp; had a 2nd grey-larger comb which is the reason I had to buy an entire package for the one comb.  My grandkids keep needing a comb &amp; I have given all away but the last one which disappeared too.</li>
    <li> these are great, sturdy combs. one of them (i think the pink one) is sparkly. i took away the pointy one and gave the rest to the kids. price has dropped 60 cents since i bought them and i just added another to my cart. i can&#x27;t beat this price anywhere. we can never find our combs, so my solution is just to buy a lot of them :)</li>
    <li> We have 5 kids so, for us, combs seem to just disappear never to return.  I&#x27;ve tried buying them at dollar stores but the pointy teeth hurt my head.  These are quality combs with a great price which allows me to stock up.</li>
    <li> They are really too small and thin.  I have no other problem with them and am just typing to meet the minimum word requirement.</li>
    <li> Given the price, this might be the best set of combs I own. Enough variety to cut hair, smooth tangles, trim a beard, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them arrived packaged well and intact. I would purchase this set again, although unless some of the combs are lost I shouldn&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> Awesome combs worth every penny heh. Only thing I would say is more gender neutral colors would be amazing. But realistically they are sturdy and well made so who cares.</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> I like to have extra combs on hand for friends and family that may be visiting and these combs are wonderful.  They are sturdy and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I bought these to &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; to my order so they qualify for Free Super Saver Shipping, turns out I like them, especially the 2 smaller ones that I use for combing my beard....lol For a few bucks you can&#x27;t beat it, I recommend.</li>
    <li> I needed an inexpensive pack of combs that would be used each only for a few days.  The comb feels a little sharp against the scalp- just a bit- so I use them gently, but for a short-term comb, they are great.</li>
    <li> I liked the combs…&lt;br /&gt;All the combs are of different sizes.. i feel this item is best for the price.</li>
    <li> A verity of combs. One comb as good as another. You would think. But dollar store combs feel funny through hair. This brand is nice.</li>
    <li> I thought it will be larger. If you have long thick hair i won&#x27;t recommend this product. But a great price.</li>
    <li> Good combs, good combination. Good price.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot go wrong.with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend this. Better and cheaper than buying at a dollar store.</li>
    <li> Good variety and size for little girl</li>
    <li> Three stars ! For the cheap price you can&#x27;t pass these up !</li>
    <li> What can really be said to satisfy Amazon&#x27;s word count requirement? Six different combs, all good quality, fantastic price point.</li>
    <li> just combs, nothing magical but the variety and the quality rock. i use to buy these at the beauty supply and then they decide to separate them and charge more (because thats fair right? lol) so this is easier and cheaper and the cool part is I don&#x27;t have to treck all the way to the beauty store to get them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting pretty tired of Amazon and the bait-and-switch system going on.  Amazon has made it very difficult to ever know what you are ordering and getting.  It&#x27;s broad strokes- you can&#x27;t be too picky or you&#x27;ll spend all your time sending things back.  Batteries?  Might be loose and unprotected, and might not work.  Toiletries?  might be old and expired, or damaged, or dirty.  Things are often different than pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a small issue, but irritating just the same.  This assorted pack of combs was not in the colors stated in the description.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that much, but I don&#x27;t love using a pink or purple or rose or periwinkle comb at the gym, so out of a pack of 6 combs I will use 2 (the two tiny pocket combs match the picture and description).  i would not have purchased this pack if I&#x27;s know what I would actually get.</li>
    <li> Great set of combs. The price (as of now) is cheap and fair. The quality... It does the job, but does not feel high quality.</li>
    <li> Great value for money.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and like to straighten it every so often. The straightener is so hot that I use these combs to not only part my hair (when curly parts naturally) but as a buffer to comb my hair when I straighten it. Work well for what it&#x27;s intended to do and for the price you can&#x27;t beat getting 6 of them.</li>
    <li> Three stars because these are small. They are not what I would consider full size combs, and certainly not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> These combs are mediocre quality, but the price is real cheap for the set. At my local drug store, comparable combs would cost a dollar each for the smaller ones and two dollars for the bigger ones, so this set is half the price. 3 stars for quality + 1 star for price &#x3D; 4 stars total.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived on Time as it said it would no complaints + ) &#x3D; ) &#x3D;0 &#x3D;) &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my family. The price and quality are perfect for what you get. I love the different bristle sizes and combing styles, very convenient for my 2 year old daughters hair. Thank YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for inexpensive combs for use with hospice patients and I found these. They&#x27;re exactly as pictured and nice quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed - a few cheap combs. I hated never being able to find a comb in our house, do to a kid or spouse taking it and loosing it. A 3$ pack of combs solved that problem. These seem to be durable enough for our hairs, have had no teeth break off yet. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> So good it hurts. I keep one in my pocket at work, take it out ever so often in the middle of an employee conversation and start combing my hair. It gets a laugh &amp;#34;60% of the time, everytime&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have the side-part fade haircut so these babies are perfect. My wife uses them and my son (5 1/2) uses them too, Great quality, greater price.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> A single father learning french braiding for his daughter needs combs and these were perfect especially the one with the long tooth like pic. i highly recommend because the quality is very good and they give a combo pack so thank you very much</li>
    <li> Good supply of combs, sturdy, enough combs to place everywhere you need one. Great colors. a comb is a comb</li>
    <li> three big, three small, actually useful in everyday use. the bigger ones can be keep in room, while the smaller ones can be portable everywhere</li>
    <li> As expected. They are combs and they work.</li>
    <li> Good price great combs!  Bought them for my daughters hair and keep them in various diaper bags etc. love them</li>
    <li> Perfect set of combs with a wide variety of choices.  It was also a great price for what you get!</li>
    <li> Wow do these bend. Fortunately they&#x27;re cheap but yeah. I bought these and then bought some Kent combs afterwards. It&#x27;s a world of difference but also a worlds difference in price. These are okay combs but you should look at other brands.</li>
    <li> Handy when you loose a comb.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Does the job.</li>
    <li> I put them everywhere at home to comb my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> my dog bit all of them but good stuff</li>
    <li> A bit hard on llama hair, gets stuck a lot. Combs break easily as well. Overall, the fiber produced by a llama is very soft and is naturally lanolin free.</li>
    <li> Good pack for the price. Good quality on the combs. Use them to slick back hair and they work great.</li>
    <li> Three plus bucks are about what this set is worth.Maybe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go crazy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sasson is not what is used to be</li>
    <li> For being such a known brand these are terrible. Super duper cheap plastic and hm just..bad. I&#x27;ll definitely just get better combs directly in person from a nearby salon instead</li>
    <li> Combs.  Good price. Not much to say.</li>
    <li> Nah.  Some combs are too soft and start to get gnarly after awhile.  These are the higher quality combs.  This pack should last my two toddlers way into their high school years.  Oh now I&#x27;m sad!</li>
    <li> ...Just as described. I don&#x27;t think anyone can complain about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, I would have appreciated a holding pouch of sorts, but for the price, just the combs are good enough.</li>
    <li> I love these varieties of combs It does what it&#x27;s intended to do. Nice price I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice quality and assortment. Very durable! The teeth of the combs are well rounded so they don&#x27;t scratch the scalp and are kind to the hair. The assortment of combs are fantastic whether you&#x27;re a cosmetologist (as I used to be) or simply need combs for around the house. Great package at a great price.</li>
