      <li>This essential oil perfume is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s best described as some sort of cleaning fluid smell.</li>
      <li>Best musk oil I&#x27;ve bought in a long time!!!</li>
      <li>Thing is, I like to reserve the Muguet for spring, and wear a strong musk or sandalwood the rest of the time.</li>
      <li>Cant even describe the smell - just a strong flowery scent and smells like cheap soap / lotion.</li>

      <li>but I really like it.</li>
      <li>It last a long time and in still my all time favorite!</li>
      <li>strong musk was what I wanted and it was not strong, and it faded rather fast, I thought.</li>
      <li>One is light, floral, almost a grassy scent while the other is all about the mysteries of the Orient.</li>
      <li>I bought Wild Sunflower over ten years ago.</li>

    <li> Nice, fresh, clean scent....lasts a long time.  Not watered down.  Packaged securely.  I&#x27;d buy it again...and again.</li>
    <li> I REALLY, REALLY wanted to like this.  Was so anxious to get it.  Other reviews were great so I am wondering if mine just got messed up or something.  It stinks.  Really stinks.  Nothing musky at all about this.  It smells like hand soap but not the good kind.  So disappointed.  Cant even describe the smell - just a strong flowery scent and smells like cheap soap / lotion.</li>
    <li> I love love love this scent. I continue to order this product whenever I run out. I usually order 3 at a time. Pleasant &amp; non-antagonizing to others.</li>
    <li> I used to get this locally, they quit carrying it, I found it here and I am happy! It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Loved the musky smell of this stuff. People complimented the scent a lot too. It is an usual scent but I really like it.</li>
    <li> This will be my 3rd bottle of this perfume. It last a long time and in still my all time favorite!</li>
    <li> It contains 2 of my favourite scents: musk and lily of the valley, (or &#x27;muguet&#x27;) so you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d rate it higher. Thing is, I like to reserve the Muguet for spring, and wear a strong musk or sandalwood the rest of the time. I wasn&#x27;t so keen on both together. One is light, floral, almost a grassy scent while the other is all about the mysteries of the Orient. I like to keep those two separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strong musk was what I wanted and it was not strong, and it faded rather fast, I thought. My all-time favourite musk, like so many, is Coty&#x27;s Wild Musk. It wasn&#x27;t anything like that, so I&#x27;ll keep looking through the musks.</li>
    <li> I bought Wild Sunflower over ten years ago. The fragrance isn&#x27;t listed here so it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s been discontinued. This tiny bottle though has lasted me forever, it&#x27;s only now half empty. I hadn&#x27;t used it in a long time when I decided to see if the fragrance was still there or if it had gone sour like some perfumes do. Nope, it smelled just as nice as the day I bought it. What I also love is the bottle is pretty dang durable for being glass. It&#x27;s rolled off my bathroom counter countless times and it&#x27;s never even chipped! Also, the scent stays All Day. I took a shower and the scent was still there! If you want a perfume that will last you years, with a fragrance that never fades or sours, and a durable bottle I suggest you buy one of the Auric Blends. And seeing as how they&#x27;re about $7 dollars each they won&#x27;t break your bank :D</li>
    <li> Stinks. Can&#x27;t quite place my finger on it but it&#x27;s best described as some sort of cleaning fluid smell. Really unpleasant. What I was looking for was a an earthy musky fragrance but what I got was just gross.</li>
    <li> Best musk oil I&#x27;ve bought in a long time!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear deodorant or perfume, but people always compliment me on my smell when I barley dab this on  It&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> exactly what was ordered</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this oil...but now it&#x27;s back.  I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
    <li> AWWWW... okay, but not my favorite!</li>
    <li> It smells great,I love this body oil and I also recommend it to anybody who want to smell good...Great product.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. It smells amazing and lasts a really long time.  I find that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wayyyyy to floral for me. Sharply so. This doesnt smell very sexy in my opinion; it&#x27;s a nice smell but way too sweet &amp; flowery- Even after I rubbed it into  skin &amp; let it sit. I even put it on my armpits lol (that was the best smelling option :X) long lasting &amp; noticeable but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Excellent, great value for the price.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t keep scent very long</li>
    <li> This essential oil perfume is wonderful.  Floral but not overpowering.  It lingers but does not overpower. Definately something I would order again.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t smell anything like African musk to me. It had a heavy floral smell.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34;...did not like it at all.</li>
