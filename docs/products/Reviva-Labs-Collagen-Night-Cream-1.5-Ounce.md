      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this company and their products.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years and love it.</li>
      <li>I have never found a better product at a better price in all those years.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite night cream ever.</li>
      <li>I just wanted a nighttime moisturizer, but I got more.</li>
      <li>I used to love this cream</li>
      <li>Bought this because of my love of the Reviva Labs Body Firming Lotion (with Elastin &amp; Collagen).  </li>
      <li>Goes on very smooth and gives very quick results.</li>
      <li>A friend recommended this product and I was excited to try it!</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I like a super rich, emollient night cream - this is probably not the greatest under makeup or for daytime as it&#x27;s maybe too rich/semi-oily.</li>
      <li>I also received it very quickly and appreciate it.</li>
      <li>It is a decent and fairly inexpensive night cream.</li>
      <li>Its light on the face and silky not greasy.</li>
      <li>I use it lightly in the day as well as for my night cream.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery also.</li>
      <li>so worth it.</li>
      <li>I like it very much, it is a heavier cream</li>
      <li>This was not the cream I was expecting, I had purchased a jar of collagen night cream from a local dept store that I loved (but they do not normally carry the product and it is no longer available from the store)</li>
      <li>skin is smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>it works as good as the much more expensive versions...</li>
      <li>This one works very well to maintain moisture balance, minimize wrinkles and it is very gentle.</li>
      <li>Since I started using this cream at night, my face feels moisturized and super soft in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream - wish I would of started using it before 59 years old - but none the less It has made a difference in the texture and diminishing of fine lines.  </li>
      <li>It is thick but with my dry skin, it replenishes it wonderfully!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, Pricey but</li>
      <li>The collagen really does help so much.</li>
      <li>Thanks for keeping it in stock.  </li>
      <li>I have had many issues with irritation or allergic reactions to other products.</li>
      <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have noticed a huge improvement in the overall appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is heavy so use it with a light touch, at night use more and if you need it under make up, pat a little in about 30 minutes before you apply make up!  </li>
      <li>Just a little keeps the skin smooth and moisturizes for hours.</li>
      <li>Clearly there&#x27;s an ingredient that I&#x27;m allergic to.</li>
      <li>and this doesn&#x27;t clog the pores and my skin is so soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
      <li>found this to be SUPER greasy and really long to actually soak into the skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Reviva product line to anyone who is looking to improve the overall look and feel of their skin.</li>
      <li>My face is usually extremely dry this time of year (I live in Michigan), and burns as soon as I get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>This contains natural ingredients and is actually soothing for my facial skin.</li>
      <li>As a very dry skin person this makes my skin feel very soft and moisturized.  </li>

    <li> It is a decent and fairly inexpensive night cream.</li>
    <li> it works as good as the much more expensive versions...that&#x27;s not to say that it does anything, but I am addicted to pursuing youth in a jar, tube or bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 8 months and have to say every morning I wake up with fantastically moisturized skin.</li>
    <li> This collagen is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its light on the face and silky not greasy. It makes the skin look dewy. I can tell a big difference after one week use.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I also purchase another cream from Reviva Labs. It leaves my skin smooth. I have noticed less wrinkles when I wake up in the morning. Will continue to use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of my love of the Reviva Labs Body Firming Lotion (with Elastin &amp; Collagen).  However, I was not thrilled with this.  It doesn&#x27;t soak in very well, and I was afraid of getting my pillow oily. Maybe that&#x27;s the price you pay for a collagen cream, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Thanks for keeping it in stock.  I also received it very quickly and appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream - wish I would of started using it before 59 years old - but none the less It has made a difference in the texture and diminishing of fine lines.  I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> found this to be SUPER greasy and really long to actually soak into the skin. Will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a nighttime moisturizer, but I got more. Put this on your face, hands, neck, anywhere that is dry or needs help. The collagen really does help so much. It&#x27;s a little greasy, so do it at night. I&#x27;m serious -- this stuff works!</li>
    <li> This cream is fab for skin over 60, makes a difference and this price is super!!  I use it day and night.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my face,I put it in the back of legs and derrière after micro needling. The elasticity on my skin has definitely improved. I&#x27;ll do this for 4 weeks and then switch to DMAE</li>
    <li> this product has made all the difference on my acne scars! i would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This sounds crazy, but I use this on my lips instead of lipstick, gloss or chap stick. They all chap my lips, but this works.</li>
    <li> works wonders on the skin.  You have to try it !!!!  Goes on very smooth and gives very quick results.</li>
    <li> Works as well as Philosophy at a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. Has no overpowering or offensive odor. Using it in conjunction with the Reviva firming lotion to keep my skin moisturized and elastic as I drop excess weight.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, it is a heavier cream so it is especially useful overnight. At age 82, I have used lotions and creams at every dollar level. I have never found a better product at a better price in all those years. It is heavy so use it with a light touch, at night use more and if you need it under make up, pat a little in about 30 minutes before you apply make up!  You cannot miss seeing the difference.</li>
    <li> I have used this face cream now for 5 years. I have had many issues with irritation or allergic reactions to other products. This one works very well to maintain moisture balance, minimize wrinkles and it is very gentle. I use it lightly in the day as well as for my night cream.</li>
    <li> As a very dry skin person this makes my skin feel very soft and moisturized.  I don&#x27;t know how it would wrk for you oily skin folks.</li>
    <li> This was not the cream I was expecting, I had purchased a jar of collagen night cream from a local dept store that I loved (but they do not normally carry the product and it is no longer available from the store) I saw this one advertised and thought it would have the same ingredients and feel the same but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m sure this would work for some but not for those who are looking for a non greasy application.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this brand. Was to greasy. Probably works, I only use if hair will be washed next day. Smell wasn&#x27;t that good.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite night cream ever. I have very dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t clog the pores and my skin is so soft in the morning. Quick delivery also.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have very sensitive skin, and I like a super rich, emollient night cream - this is probably not the greatest under makeup or for daytime as it&#x27;s maybe too rich/semi-oily.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have noticed a huge improvement in the overall appearance of my skin.  My face is usually extremely dry this time of year (I live in Michigan), and burns as soon as I get out of the shower.  Since I started using this cream at night, my face feels moisturized and super soft in the morning.  I am also extremely prone to cystic acne on my chin, which has completely disappeared.  I highly recommend the Reviva product line to anyone who is looking to improve the overall look and feel of their skin.</li>
    <li> What happened to Reviva?  I bought a number of different products from them recently (4 or 5).  They&#x27;re all crap now.  Some of the products  arrived without even having been mixed thoroughly, including this one.  Nutricity, the vendor through Amazon, was hell to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviva used to make nice, effective products.  Not anymore.  Never again will I buy Reviva, and never again will I buy anything coming from Nutricity.</li>
    <li> As a melanoma survivor with sensitive skin, I have to be careful what products I use on my skin. This contains natural ingredients and is actually soothing for my facial skin. Just a little keeps the skin smooth and moisturizes for hours. I have been using this product for a long time. Fast delivery, Pricey but so worth it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I used to love this cream but now I am scared to order it because the last batch was the consistency of Vaseline. I had to throw it out. Why would they change it?? Not a smart move.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product and I was excited to try it! Unfortunately I put it on and instantly my skin went red and hot. Clearly there&#x27;s an ingredient that I&#x27;m allergic to. I haven&#x27;t returned it but should.</li>
    <li> I could tell from the first night that I used it that with just a small amount of the cream it was truly moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it. It is thick but with my dry skin, it replenishes it wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Excellent, no problems, delivered as scheduled. thank you</li>
    <li> Love this company and their products. This should be used in conjunction with their elastin cream. Two weeks nightly for one/ two weeks nightly for the other for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smooth and soft. However I also us their 10% glycolic acid cream nightly as well</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rate it because I didn&#x27;t use it long enough.</li>
