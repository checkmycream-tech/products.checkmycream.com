    <li> Easy review. I have used this face lotion my whole life and regret times I have used other brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to putting stuff on my face and bought this after reading reviews online.  It goes on easily and feels ok, but it does have a very slight perfume smell to it.  It&#x27;s very slight and I doubt others can smell it - but I was hoping for something with no perfume smell at all since it&#x27;s designed for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel absorbs easily after about 60 seconds and does a great job of moisturizing the face.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and have had no issues with it causing any pimples.</li>
    <li> It was great experience that every night and morning I can experience my skin restoration.&lt;br /&gt;Very excellent.&lt;br /&gt;No regret.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect present.</li>
    <li> all good fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
