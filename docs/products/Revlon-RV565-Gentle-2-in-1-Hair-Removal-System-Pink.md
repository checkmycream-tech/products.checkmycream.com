      <li>It looks perfect from the distance.</li>
      <li>I must say, I was very impressed by the shaving part.</li>

      <li>/&gt;This is a perfect way to test and see if you are a fan of the epilator.</li>

      <li>It is a great tool.</li>
      <li>and i was surprise on how great its shaver works</li>
      <li>People were happy with their purchase.</li>
      <li>I found it very effective for that, I think because the hair there can get a bit longer before being noticable.  </li>
      <li>Have it for 2 years and loving it!</li>
      <li>I just scraped it off the plastic as best I could and went on my way :-)</li>
      <li>I think the best thing about it is that it does have a shaving end too, which I use it on my legs because after I use the epilator on my arms, I don&#x27;t think I will be able to go with the pain all over again on my legs.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>However, ifyou are a newcomer to epilating and are still unsure if it&#x27;s for you, I would still recommend the Revlon as a good starter machine.</li>
      <li>Good for the underarms...</li>
      <li>For $30-ish with shipping, I consider this a good investment in testing out the waters of epilation.     </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good product because it removes hair from root.</li>
      <li>the shaver side &#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>This one was way cheap and had great reviews!</li>
      <li>but I am hopeful for good results.</li>
      <li>So this would be good for the \\&quot;refined cavewoman look\\</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a good deal for the money, but I now wish I had bought the Braun..</li>
      <li>It took a good hour or two.</li>
      <li>This product does it&#x27;s job, it&#x27;s a good epilator.</li>
      <li>Im very happy with my new toy!!!    </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure will catch all kinds of nastiness!  </li>
      <li>When I first got this, it worked great!</li>
      <li>(it hurts more on my legs anyway!).</li>
      <li>However, once that wears off this will be a great easy to use tool.</li>
      <li>This product was amazing.</li>
      <li>But the shaver end is amazing.</li>
      <li>Another reviewer compared it aptly to having a tattoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to call and see if the company will do anything for me because I really do like this epilator and the results were awesome.</li>
      <li>it still works effectively and reliably.</li>
      <li>The addition of a shaver is nice if you need it.    </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the shaver side, either, yet, but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>The shaver end also gets a very close shave, perfect for underarms or bikini areas that the epilator may miss.     </li>
      <li>Is fast is convinient i love it !!!!!</li>
      <li>The epilator works flawlessly and pulls the hair out right at the root, while the elecrtic shaver is ideal for more sensitive ares.</li>
      <li>Its a great thing to buy and totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>However, the rubber on the sides, which I thought were great at first because it helps you hold a nice grip has started to melt.</li>
      <li>so you can be very precise.</li>
      <li>But worked perfectly when it was actually working.</li>
      <li>I found that the shaver had a tendency to catch and pull hairs resulting in more pain than the epilator would have caused since it didn&#x27;t pull the hair out, but rather snagged it and wouldn&#x27;t let go, forcing me to yank it out.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel safe the way this one does.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re able to buck up a bit and get through it, you&#x27;ll like the results.</li>
      <li>SO LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>but I definately love the convenience over shaving.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t use a better coating on these parts???  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s OK now.</li>
      <li>Its an ok epilator, but definitely not the best.</li>
      <li>Better still, it lasts and</li>
      <li>I love this device.</li>
      <li>But, just as I discovered after doing my legs, the results make it all worthwhile.</li>
      <li>It gets almost as close to the skin as a razor (maybe if someone was touching you</li>
      <li>I think for the money you pay you can not expect anything magical</li>
      <li>Perhaps if the instructions had been better, it wouldn&#x27;t have happened.</li>
      <li>I love mine.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
      <li>That or treat it like a once-in-a-while \\&quot;reset\\&quot; for when the tips of your hair become more noticeable when shaving.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s given me more confidence, I can wear cute shirts without worrying about what my underarms look like now.     </li>
      <li>As for the shaver side -- it is OK.</li>
      <li>I do have a good tolerance to pinching(sp)and not afraid of needles, so</li>
      <li>Make sure you get all the hair</li>
      <li>So it took me many years to get the courage to order one and try it out.</li>
      <li>I must admit, like most people, I wasa bit on edge to order a epilator.</li>
      <li>i get more than what i paid for</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t regret the purchase. :)</li>
      <li>It get&#x27;s credit for most of the stars)</li>
      <li>I was actually able to remove ALL of the hair</li>
      <li>I personally love it.</li>
      <li>: Cute</li>
      <li>price  -Very effective shaver  -Gentle epilator    </li>
      <li>Just take care of it and you&#x27;ll be fine :)</li>
      <li>The epilator plucks most of the hair but the one problem I have is that I have fine hair so it misses some.</li>
      <li>As far as the epilator it does a great job of removing hair.  </li>
      <li>This epilator is SO awesome and the pain is very minimal.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend you not to buy it.</li>
      <li>This is a handy item for first time users</li>
      <li>Although it is very effective, it is kind of slow compared to silk epil, I liked the color a lot</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s probably my fine hair and not the epilator.</li>
      <li>The quality of shaving is fine.</li>
      <li>I did it after shower and a exfoliating with Olay, and it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle, light weight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This hair remover has 2 different methods which you can use to get a smooth clean shave. The shaver works wonders on legs, underarms and especially the bikini line. I normally cannot shave my bikini line more than once every few days (to avoid knicks and cuts), but with this tool you can use it everyday and keep things very smooth. It has a trimmer built in also so you can be very precise. The epilator end is the same as many of the more expensive shavers, and works just as well. Of course the epilator part of this hair remover is going to hurt - it pulls the hair out by the root. If you expect an epilator not to cause a little bit of pain, you&#x27;re in denial. Bottom line: the results are worth a little discomfort.   Even if you never use the epliator end, this product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is a handy item for first time users but I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend the eppilator portion for anything other than the legs. if you want more use for your buck get an epilator with multiple heads.  the electic shaver side is awesome for my daughter who is just begining to shave her legs.</li>
    <li> hi my name is korina and I really like it, I removed all my hair face an hair legs twice a week  and now the hair in growing slow, u feel pain but is WORTHY</li>
    <li> I only use the epilator side for my underarms, and I find that it works very well in that area. I have tried it on my legs, but it has too few tweezers to get that job done quickly enough for my liking, so I just stick to shaving the legs (it hurts more on my legs anyway!). Obviously any product that pulls hair from the root will hurt, so yes this does hurt, but one does become accustomed to it. As for the shaver side -- it is OK. I find it most useful when I am in a huge hurry and need to wear a skirt/dress/shorts and haven&#x27;t shaved my legs. It doesn&#x27;t get my legs perfectly smooth, but it&#x27;s good enough for when I&#x27;m in too much of a hurry to do a proper shave or just too lazy. It IS possible to cut oneself with this though, as I learned trying to shave the back of my knee. It wasn&#x27;t so much a cut as it was a bad scrape, but it hurt a lot nonetheless, so be mindful of the angle at which you hold the device! I would recommend this for someone who only need to use it on the underarms or just smaller areas of the body (NOT the face) who is not accustomed to using an epilator. It&#x27;s definitely a nice product for this price point, and I would not think anyone would be too disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> This little epilator works great for underarms but definitely not for the legs.  I bought it for my underarms and for that it works great!  I tried it on my legs and it hurt so much I got goose bumps!  It hurts on the underarms but nothing that isn&#x27;t tolerable.  Left mine smooth for over 2 weeks! Its so great not to have to shave, esp because my underarms get such bad razor burn and bumps from shaving!</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator, I heard that emjoi was alot better but they are pricier and I didn&#x27;t want to waste money on something I never tried before and end up not liking. I think this works wonderfully!! It took off all the hair by the roots, long ones, short ones, thick ones and fine ones. So far I&#x27;ve only tried the epilator side and only used it on my underarm. My underarms are sooo smooth and I don&#x27;t think it hurts. If you can stand waxing you can do this. I use monistat chafing gel after epilation to calm the skin. I thought this product was cordless but it&#x27;s not, which is really no biggie for me.</li>
    <li> I Love it, even tough is a litle painfull in the begining its better than biquini wax!  Is fast is convinient i love it !!!!!Save money and time!And just not shaving every other day is great!It last 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> i get more than what i paid for it&#x27;s the best epilator i ever have. i have tried expensive ones but this one is so gentle on delicate parts and i was surprise on how great its shaver works I SO LOVE IT. i extremely recommend this one. i never gt wrong with revlon brand. i swear even in flat irons.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased a coiled spring epilady contraption when I was pretty young and we all tried it, and then it was promptly stored under the sink, never to be seen again.  It was SO painful and absolutely AWFUL.  The pain was unbearable and you were still covered in hair!      Now, about 15 years later I stumbled across the new and improved epilator of today.  I didn&#x27;t see how ripping ones hair out could be any less painful than it was 15 years ago but I&#x27;m at a point now later in life where I have 4 children and I simply do NOT have the time to constantly be shaving my legs.  The appeal to have smooth hair free legs was too much to pass on, especially for $17!  However, I was still terrified and traumatized by that archaic epilady from 15 years ago.  I kept telling myself, if I could endure natural unmedicated child birth 3 TIMES, I could certainly manage this.  Right???    Yes.  This epilator is SO awesome and the pain is very minimal.  It is NOTHING compared to the old spring style types.  My legs and underarms are hair free and still have no stubble.  I can&#x27;t vouch for how long as I&#x27;ve only had it a few days.  The pain is not bad at all, I would definitely compare it to getting a tattoo.  It stings at first and then it numbs somewhat and is very manageable.  I did not shave prior to epilating but I think that would definitely make it more manageable for users with a lower pain threshold.      As far as the epilator it does a great job of removing hair.  I found that the shaver had a tendency to catch and pull hairs resulting in more pain than the epilator would have caused since it didn&#x27;t pull the hair out, but rather snagged it and wouldn&#x27;t let go, forcing me to yank it out.  The concept of having the shaver on one end and epilator on the other is very cool.      My two main complaints about this product is the length of the cord (maybe 4 feet), and the melty sticky dark pink sections.  It feels pretty gross to the touch and I&#x27;m sure will catch all kinds of nastiness!  I intend to put packing tape over these sections to cover them and try to keep them from getting too yucky.  I don&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t use a better coating on these parts???  When it does get too gross I intend to purchase the [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] instead of this one.  I was really leaning towards that one but fear of the pain lead me to purchase this one due to the sizable price difference between the two products.  This one definitely gets the job done but they could do a better job on the quality and workmanship of their product.</li>
    <li> It works, but it doesn&#x27;t pull as many hairs out than my old Braun did. I thought it would be a good deal for the money, but I now wish I had bought the Braun..</li>
    <li> I really like it.  I&#x27;m not used to waxing at all, and I thought the pain was manageable..  I think the best thing about it is that it does have a shaving end too, which I use it on my legs because after I use the epilator on my arms, I don&#x27;t think I will be able to go with the pain all over again on my legs.  But I really like it, and recommended it to a bunch of my friends.  If your looking for your first epilator, I would give it a go beause this one was my first too and I give it 4/5 stars.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the blades look vicious and they always scare me the first time but that&#x27;s all the negative factor I can think of.</li>
    <li> Cheap item, does its job ok, but more expensive ones can do it much better. Dark pink areas are really sticky and not pleasant to hold, they get very dirty and its impossible to clean them. Small hair stick to epilator and it looks really disgusting. Buy smth different instead...</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago, and now that I have used it multiple time I can really see how it is working for me. First of all, I have very pale skin and black hair, this makes it so easy to see the hair follicles on my legs. I would be embarrassed to wear skirts and shorts even if I shaved! I&#x27;ve always had to shave my legs everyday to make them only semi better. I should also mention that if I had goose bumps after shaving then the jig was up and my legs were stubbly.  I have an internship this summer, and it will be unbearable if I had to wear tights everyday, so I decided to give this a try.    I waited until I had a lot of hair growth and then settled myself into try it. I popped some ibuprofen before hand so my legs didn&#x27;t become so irritated. It hurts like a mother. After my first swipe I thought to myself \\&quot;Shoot, did I just waste money?\\&quot; Being as stubborn as I am though, I refuse to admit defeat and pushed through the pain. The reviews are right when they say after a bit the pain turns into a dull one. I did both of my legs, slathered some lotion on and called it a night. The next morning I woke up and went to the gym and didn&#x27;t shave my legs, and for the first time in my life my legs looked like they had been shaved! I spent the week wearing dresses and shorts and enjoying my hair free legs at the gym.    About a week later when I noticed some hair growth, I just touched them up, and the pain was not nearly as bad because most of the hair was gone. A week after that I touched them up again, and the pain was almost not there. It&#x27;s now about three weeks later and my legs are pretty much hair free all the time. I touch them up every week (10 mins max). When I get goose bumps, my legs still feel hair free.     Needless to say, I am ready for the summer. For the price, this is probably the best buy. I can&#x27;t imagine what the more expensive ones are like, because I like this one so much. I knew I was sold on this when I was in a pool with my boyfriend and he touched my legs and said \\&quot;wow, they are really smooth today!\\&quot; Maybe when I get older I&#x27;ll try an expensive one. But if you are like me, and a little self conscious about this stuff then I would give this a try.</li>
    <li> I must admit, like most people, I wasa bit on edge to order a epilator. Only because so many complained on how much it hurt. So it took me many years to get the courage to order one and try it out. I just got it today (7/16/10) and tried it on my arms a little bit, to just see how much pain there would be, and what to expect.    I do have a good tolerance to pinching(sp)and not afraid of needles, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad. Being that I shaved last night, I tried it on a little part of my arm, and you can feel the tweezers pull out the hair, but not to the point where your yelling \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; or jerking the machine off the skin because it hurt. I didn&#x27;t do any of that, I actually said, \\&quot;what? that&#x27;s it?\\&quot;    Yeah,I have a little redness in the 2 small places I tried the epi on, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. It was a little itchy, but went away in a matter of seconds. The areas are smooth, which is pretty cool. The packaging says up to 6 weeks of freedom, so we will see. If in reality it only lasts 3 weeks, I&#x27;m  fine with that, as long as I don&#x27;t have to shave every day.</li>
    <li> This product is very durable.  It is painless as well I love the two sided feature many only come with one.  I have dropped this and it broke apart, but it was easity put back together and works fine.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an epilator, and after several decades of shaving in the morning and having picky legs at night I have to admit I&#x27;m in crazy love with this thing! Does it hurt? YES! Another reviewer compared it aptly to having a tattoo. The first time I started to use the epilator on my legs (with about 3 days of growth, as I wanted to be sure there was enough hair there for the machine to grab), the first minute or so had me convinced I could never endure finishing my entire leg. I was reminded of the tattoo comparison...I&#x27;ve had several tattoos, and felt much the same way during the first few minutes. But then my body&#x27;s natural pain killers kicked in and I managed to get through the rest without too much wincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why put yourself through all that? Well, now that I have endured that initial epilation, I find it easy and almost painless to keep it up. I give my legs a quick once-over every few days to nab the few hairs that I might have missed or those that have grown in. The rest of the time, my legs feel incredibly smooth and touchable, far more than they ever felt even right after shaving. Better still, it lasts and lasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely isn&#x27;t for everyone. If you have a low tolerance for pain, you&#x27;ll probably have a really hard time enduring that first encounter. But if you&#x27;re able to buck up a bit and get through it, you&#x27;ll like the results. The first time you epilate you might find that afterward your legs are covered with pink dots or even tiny dots of blood here and there.....mine were. If this is the first time you&#x27;ve physically yanked all the hairs out of your leg, it should be no surprise that your skin looks a bit traumatized. Don&#x27;t freak out, it&#x27;s a perfectly natural reaction. Apply a soothing lotion or aloe vera gel with lidocaine and the dots will quickly fade away. As you continue to epilate, you&#x27;ll find that it becomes easier and less painful, and also less traumatic to your skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced the red spots since those first one or two epilations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good little machine, and I really like that it is both a shaver and epilator (I haven&#x27;t the courage to epilate my underarms...well, not yet anyway!). The instructions could have been better, but the device is pretty straight-forward. I would recommend it, but not for the faint of heart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 2010 Update: My little machine is still going strong...it still works effectively and reliably. And I finally mustered the courage to epilate both my underarms and my bikini line. Painful? Oh, yes! Doing my underarms was by far the most uncomfortable. But, just as I discovered after doing my legs, the results make it all worthwhile. The process leaves my skin incredibly smooth. Best of all, there&#x27;s no danger of painful nicks, razor burn or skin bumps with epilation. I picked up an after-epilation lotion (a product made by Emjoi, and also sold here at Amazon) that soothes my skin after epilating and discourages hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m still in love with my little machine and definitely recommend giving epilation a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feb 2011 Update: Well, after a whole lot of epilating, my little machine done gave out! I actually take the blame for this....when I first bought the unit, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to eject the epilator head and change it to the shaver head. The instructions were no help and in the course of poking around with it I accidentally pulled off a thin, metal bar that helped to hold the epilator gears together. I had a heck of a time figuring out how to put the metal bar back on, and I don&#x27;t think I ever got it quite right. I think this contributed to the unit&#x27;s early demise. Perhaps if the instructions had been better, it wouldn&#x27;t have happened. At any rate, I&#x27;ve replaced the Revlon epilator with a more expensive Braun machine. The Braun has some design, accessory and effectiveness advantages over the Revlon that, in my opinion, make it worth the extra cost. However, ifyou are a newcomer to epilating and are still unsure if it&#x27;s for you, I would still recommend the Revlon as a good starter machine. It did a fine job for as long as it worked (and I did work it hard!), and a smaller investment makes sense until you know for sure whether you&#x27;ll be able to tolerate epilation. I&#x27;ve seen that some reviewers had a problem with the unit overheating and melting the soft, plastic sides.....I used the machine hard and although it sometimes got quite warm I never experienced the overheating problem. I wonder if this is because they were pushing down on the epilator. There&#x27;s no need or advantage in applying pressure while epilating....just let the epilator glide over your skin and work in circles. Hairs grow in all directions, so moving the machine in small circles gives the machine a chance to lift and catch all the hairs. I&#x27;d also recommend that before you epilate, wash your skin with an exfoliating body wash or loufa sponge to lift and expose new growth. I&#x27;ve noticed that, unlike shaving where the hair grows back thick and coarse, the new growth of hair with epilation is the soft, fine hair I had way back before I ever started shaving...so I never experience the icky, picky regrowth anymore! Yay! I still recommend the Revlon epilator, especially for first-timers.</li>
    <li> I was very worried about using it, since I&#x27;ve heard so much about how the first time is going to hurt like *!($#@, but surprisingly it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. It wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as some people told me, although it wasn&#x27;t absolutely painless.   But it does break some hair instead of pulling all of them out (hence 4 stars not 5) which will grow back much faster than the pulled out ones do.</li>
    <li> Epilation hurts like crazy the first couple times, but works like a charm!  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This little epilator is great -- it really didn&#x27;t hurt much at all, it isn&#x27;t too loud, and as a very hairy spanish girl I can tell you -- it really works! I wish I had tried one sooner in life, by now I&#x27;d probably only be doing it every month or two. As it is, the results last two weeks. The shaver end also gets a very close shave, perfect for underarms or bikini areas that the epilator may miss.     Love it, love it, love it. For the money, the shaver alone is worth it.     I have since used my SIL&#x27;s more expensive emjoie which has a lot more tweezers on it, but frankly I found the noise overwhelming, and the epilator itself scary. It hurt way more, and I was constantly scared it wasy going to cut me. It didn&#x27;t feel safe the way this one does. I&#x27;ve even tried it on my underarms!</li>
    <li> The best I have ever had! I truly recommend this model, it is both practical, was sent super fast and it really gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators for years, when my last one, which was very good, was burned out due to different voltages in another country, I bought this model. I have read the other reviews and I agree that the bright pink plastic can get sticky.     One of my main complaints about the device is that the epilator head is curved, which makes it ideal for legs, but very difficult for bikini line or underarm areas. The shaving head i do not use often. Sometimes the power contact does not immediately work and you have to wait for it to turn on, but what can you expect for twenty dollars.     Its an ok epilator, but definitely not the best. Its perfect for someone who only wants to use it for their legs and is just starting with an epilator.</li>
    <li> This little device is a great price.  I needed a shaver that did not scrape my skin (boo on my old conair) and decided to go for the Revlon \\&quot;2-fer\\&quot; and get an epilator, too.    Both options work very well.  The epilator is not particularly painful to me - just a bit tingly.     I like that the product is corded and not rechargable - this means I don&#x27;t have to worry about how much charge is on it, or when/if the recharging no longer works.  As long as the power company works, we are good to go.</li>
    <li> Well, it was my first time buying something like that.. I really like the price, the designer, but it is to start actually you are strong enough, you can be prepared for a faster one..I like it but I think I should have one faster..</li>
    <li> For $30-ish with shipping, I consider this a good investment in testing out the waters of epilation.     The pain of it reminded me of lightly running a steel wire brush over my skin. Occasionally painful like plucking, but mostly just feels sortof raw. I started with my knees, which didn&#x27;t hurt much at all, and then progressed down my leg as I got used to it. But my main problem is that it didn&#x27;t pick up a lot of the hairs. It nabbed the coarse, dark hairs but left the wispy baby hairs and my skin was very irritated afterward (there&#x27;s a red mark where every single hair was plucked). So this would be good for the \\&quot;refined cavewoman look\\&quot; I think, if you&#x27;re a bit of a masochist.     But the shaver end is amazing. It gets almost as close to the skin as a razor (maybe if someone was touching you they&#x27;d notice, but it definitely gets close enough for baring legs in public), plus it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin one bit and was pain free. LOVE the little shaver, and the epilator is just kind of a bonus if I feel like I need to be in pain one of these days.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, it worked great! Yes, there was a pain factor, but you get used to it. The first few uses are time consuming to get all the hair, but after that it&#x27;s all maintenance. The shaver is also the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The problem was that after about a month the product would keep turning off. It wasn&#x27;t because it was getting hot because sometimes it would happen right after I started it. Fiddling around with the cord (which was annoying)usually got it going again until yesterday. It just stopped working. I&#x27;m going to call and see if the company will do anything for me because I really do like this epilator and the results were awesome. My only other complaint is that the grippy pink sides got all sticky and nasty after a while.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a newby to epilating. It was attractive because of the grippy sides and the fact that it also had a shaver in case I turned out not to be a long term epilator. This product has lasted me about 2 years of regular use, but the panels are now becoming increasingly hard to keep clean. That is not a reflection on Revlon&#x27;s design, but simply a reality of all epilators using this technology. Otherwise, it has worked well, not pinched or been more painful than any other product. Also, in terms of durability it has survived multiple drops from counter height onto linoleum without sustaining any permanent damage. Next time, I think that I will try a rechargeable unit so I&#x27;m not attached to the wall, but the cord is long enough so the process isn&#x27;t annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cute; Works well; Alternate hair removal options; Grippy sides; Durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not easy to clean; Grippy sides attract dirt and residue</li>
    <li> I carefully read all reviews before buying this Revlon epilator. I was afraid to end up with the situation \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;. The reviews were very decent. People were happy with their purchase. As for me, I spent double time of the time i used to spent with my Braun silk epil (which was broken and had to be replaced). The epilator head is (1) too small and (2) is not good for legs.     although I have to admit that it is great for knees! Way better than my old epilator. and it seems that it is less painful than my old epilator. but I am used to the pain already. so I wanted something that would not be super slow.    besides, this epilator is covered by some sticky substance... not good.     I am giving 2 stars only because it actually works for this price. but honestly, if you have had an epilator before, buy something a bit more expensive. this is \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; product.</li>
    <li> the dark pink skin can melt and it melt before i received. but i lacy to return. then i use cutter to remove melt layer. it&#x27;s OK now. the epilators side didn&#x27;t completely hair remove, it have some leave. the shaver side &#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> This little thing is incredible. I know its sort of too much info but I get razor burn pretty bad in my bikini area in the summer time which, as most ladies know can be embarrassing. I got this before I went to th beach for a week. I used it for two or three days prior to going and didnt have to shave or use this epilator on my bikini area for about a week and a half and suffered no razor burn at all! Its a great thing to buy and totally worth the price. I am not sure how long itll last but I recommend cleaning it with the little brush provided. I have told all of my friends about it and I think if you can handle the pain (which isnt that bad , but could possibly be a little too much for some folks. I would equate it to getting a tattoo if you know what that feels like) you should give it a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time epilator user, and I have to say I was very skeptic about getting one. I read and reread all the reviews and debated over getting it for a few days. I finally decided to try it out.    I have very stubborn thick hair on my underarms with very rough skin, and I get painful ingrown hairs from shaving. I&#x27;ve been very embarrassed by this for years. Using the epilator helped so much with removing the thick stubborn hair and preventing ingrown hairs and definitely helped smooth my skin. It&#x27;s given me more confidence, I can wear cute shirts without worrying about what my underarms look like now.     The pain isn&#x27;t bad at all. I was scared to do my underarms and my bikini area because of how sensitive that skin is, and I actually found waxing to be much more painful in those areas. If there is any pain at all the bodies natural pain killers kick in within a minute or so. My legs, however, hurt very badly. I tried doing them once and it took barely any hairs out. Its taking me a long time to get the nerve up to try epilating my legs again. I think I may just stick to the electric shaver on the opposite side.    There is a sticky substance on the hot pink sides that drove me crazy at first, but after a few uses it wears off and your fingers don&#x27;t get sticky anymore.    Overall this is a fabulous product. I recommend it for thicker hair and smaller areas. I&#x27;m definitely not going back to a razor.</li>
    <li> It is a great tool. Not too noisy. Hurts though, but I would assume that no one would really be looking at an epilator if they cared much about that. The only thing that I did not like about it is that the dark pink grippy sides sort of attract hair... and are a little too sticky for my tastes. However, once that wears off this will be a great easy to use tool.</li>
    <li> Very user friendly, while it lasted. It actually stopped working on me after the first use. But worked perfectly when it was actually working. A little scary to use at first since it works really fast.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with my new toy!!!    I did it after shower and a exfoliating with Olay, and it worked just fine. It did hurted, but after 2 minutes I did no feel much pain at all!    Tip: Keep a wet warm towel close to you and rub it into you skin once every 5 minutes, it helped me not to feel much pain.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have had it for a couple of years. Easy to handle, light weight. It just does the job. i have no complaints about it. They all work!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a cheap tester to see if I could stand using an epilator on my legs - and if I&#x27;m brave enough - my under arms. And yes, it does hurt people! It&#x27;s yanking your hair out from the root! But I was pleasantly surprised that the pain was not too bad. And I find it better to go slow and steady with breaks.     As for the shaver, it works. But sometimes pulls the hairs instead of shaving them. However, I&#x27;m not too concerned about the shaving ability. Since I bought it for the epilator - the shaver is a nice extra.    Lastly, there IS a weird stickiness to the pink handles. Mine arrived with fingerprints embedded on one side. Yuck! It appears Revlon uses some sort of grippy coating that kinda melts after a while. I decided to get rid of it by using a toothbrush with hand soap and distilled vinegar. Then brushing the heck outta the handles and the on/off button (be careful to do a DRY brushing only!). Now my shaver has smooth sides and no stickiness. It took a good hour or two. But for the money, it was worth the buy. And I&#x27;ll probably trade up to a nicer model if I decide to use an epilator all the time.</li>
    <li> I have a different epilator on hand, but I bought this just in case the first one broke. I must say, I was very impressed by the shaving part. The epilator, though, wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s certainly gentler than my first one, but it isn&#x27;t as thorough. Good for the underarms...not so much on the legs. It pinches a lot if you don&#x27;t stretch the skin you&#x27;re epilating so watch out.   The shaver itself is enough to make me think about purchasing another one of these.   Amazing for touch ups and last minute clean-ups. The price was great, too.   The only bad thing about this is the material that the handles are made of. It starts to get sticky and eventually wears off. Not a huge problem. It&#x27;s the machine that does the work, after all. The aesthetics of it aren&#x27;t that important.     PROS  -Great price  -Very effective shaver  -Gentle epilator    CONS  -Sticky handles  -The epilator is sometimes not powerful enough    It&#x27;s worth every penny, even if you don&#x27;t use the epilator part. You won&#x27;t regret the purchase. :)</li>
    <li> works slow which makes it time consuming process. Also, the holder material is very sticky. It&#x27;s hard to clean it after using the product.     Over all it&#x27;s good product because it removes hair from root. I personally love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the epilator thinking that if I could stand plucking my eyebrows regularly, and I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of waxing efficiently (though the pain wasn&#x27;t too bad) then maybe I could just pluck all the leg hairs away... Boy was I wrong. Using this epilator on your legs or anything other than eyebrows hurts like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Luckily the razor with clipper edges works just fine. It doesn&#x27;t get me silky smooth, but it saves a lot of time between shower shaves. The grip gets really grimy looking after a while though.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good product. the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like so much, is that it sometimes cuts the hair instead of plucking it. it&#x27;s probably my fine hair and not the epilator. oh, well, all in all it&#x27;s worth the money. Thank you for fast shipping as well. I recommend this seller and the product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try an epilator out, so I chose to get this Revlon one since it was an inexpensive risk I could take. The epilator did not disappoint- it works really well to remove hairs, you just need to go over sections a few times because it doesn&#x27;t catch them all (which I&#x27;m sure you would have to do with any epilator). It&#x27;s loud, someone in the next room will hear you using it and it hurts but it&#x27;s worth the results. I&#x27;ve had the epilator for about three weeks, and I have no negative comments to make about the epilator/shaver parts themselves. However, the rubber on the sides, which I thought were great at first because it helps you hold a nice grip has started to melt. At first I didn&#x27;t know what was going on- I thought that dust was just attracted to the rubber. I tried cleaning the rubber off, scraping it and using a damp cloth. Then I realized that the rubber was actually melting, and that was why it had become such a sticky surface. I guess I&#x27;ll just have to purchase a new epilator when the rubber fully melts/gets too gross, but it works for now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before so it was a big step for me.  I was trying to find something cheap but still workable since my skin is really thin and I was afraid I might get awkward bloody lines (I got them ones after waxing).  So I decided to purchase this one since it&#x27;s not expensive and the reviwes are fine  I can not say that it&#x27;s a miracle epilator. It&#x27;s not. But it&#x27;s a nice one if you simply wanna try. I was afraid that it would hurt a lot. At first it did...but it was 100% bearable. Now I can do my both legs without pauses.   The quality of shaving is fine. It looks perfect from the distance. But if you&#x27;ll touch it..you can feel small hairs. So it&#x27;s a turn off if you want your skin to be touchable.  Although since I decided to stick with this one, I simply use the epilator side first and then use the shaving head. It helps to get smooth and silky skin for the night.   About the time it takes...It takes more time than regular shaving at least for me. Because I have to do all the areas twice or even more, moving the epilator in all the possible directions. Otherwise, small hairs stay in place.    In general, this epilator is  a good one. I think for the money you pay you can not expect anything magical</li>
    <li> This machine does not remove even one hair, however its shaver remove several hair.  I put out all my money.I strongly recommend you not to buy it.</li>
    <li> I only purchased this machine last week and started using it a couple days ago. For this price I am almost completely happy. It does hurt at first I agree with the comparisons to a tattoo; it starts out stinging quite a bit then tempers down to a slight burning sensation after a few minutes and of course the pain is worse in more sensitive areas like the ankles and bikini line (OMG ouch!). I did find that it takes what seems like forever to complete both legs; in fact I found it almost impossible to do so in one sitting.     The dark pink rubber on the machine was a little tacky when I got it, and after holding it in my hand for an extended use it seems to be melting. Apparently this is a common problem for this machine as I read another reviewer with the same issue. This aspect is annoying and I really wish it weren&#x27;t so, however the epilator and shaver both work without a problem.      Because I have only started epilating I am not sure about my regrowth time but I am hopeful for good results. Still excited about this product and I hope epilating turns out to be the right choice for me.</li>
    <li> This product works well for the price. The pink grips are sticky though. Considering that this is used for hair removal, you can imagine the amount of hair that ends up on the handle. It can however be wiped clean. The razor is very convenient on the opposite side of the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It hurts to have your hair pulled out by the root. But like my mother says \\&quot;Beauty is pain sweetheart.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect way to test and see if you are a fan of the epilator. It is inexpensive and effective and when you can&#x27;t get past one swipe of the pit then you haven&#x27;t wasted too much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can overcome the pain (which isn&#x27;t that bad), I am told that an epilator will change your life. I cannot get over the pain though. So I try and just use the razor when I can&#x27;t make it through. (the electric razor is great by the way!!! It get&#x27;s credit for most of the stars)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t work at all, so I called the mfr, and they&#x27;re gracious enough to send a replacement..</li>
    <li> Although it is very effective, it is kind of slow compared to silk epil, I liked the color a lot</li>
    <li> The Revlon 2-in-1 Shaver has replaced all of my wet-shave razors, good riddance! The epilator works flawlessly and pulls the hair out right at the root, while the elecrtic shaver is ideal for more sensitive ares. This is my second time purchasing this product and it won&#x27;t be the last!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would work faster than my $7 spring type epilator which was giving me hand cramps.  My budget is not very big at the moment, so after reading several reviews, I opted for this model.     I found it very effective at removing the peach fuzz that we middle aged women get on our faces.  I did have resort back to the spring and to tweezers for the spattering of darker thicker hairs on my chin.     I&#x27;ve never plucked the hairs on my legs before, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I found it very effective for that, I think because the hair there can get a bit longer before being noticable.  Yes it stings when the hairs are being pulled, but nowhere near as bad as I was expecting.     I haven&#x27;t gotten up the guts to try this on my armpits, yet.  Maybe some day.  I haven&#x27;t used the shaver side, either, yet, but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> Since I discovered epilators, I&#x27;ve been both fascinated and completely terrified of them, and wasn&#x27;t sure about spending a chunk of money on something I might chicken-out of ever using. For less than $20, I figured this wouldn&#x27;t be a total loss, and if i liked it, I could eventually upgrade. I ordered last friday and was smooth by monday night! The pain was intense, but definitely bearable (even on the bikini line which is where I&#x27;ve used it so far) It helps to keep skin taut. It had no problems gripping my rather course hair, both long and very short ones! I am completely smooth, and the shaver side (which I only used to see how it works, as i already have one) works better than the two more expensive ones I own! Some reviewers have already mentioned the ONE drawback of this little tool : the dark pink outer parts of it seemed to be melty rubber that collects dust, etc. However, its actually pink plastic with a clear rubber-like coating that sucks. I just scraped it off the plastic as best I could and went on my way :-)</li>
    <li> The epilator plucks most of the hair but the one problem I have is that I have fine hair so it misses some. I have to run it over the area for a while for the hair to be completely removed. The razor side is gentle too. It was pretty cheap and I received it quick so I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I really don&#x27;t think the pain factor is as bad as everyone says it is, at least depending on where you&#x27;re removing hair from.  I&#x27;ve found probably the worst place is the back of the thigh, which can indeed be quite painful, but down the shins is hardly painful at all.    There are plenty of ways to alleviate this of course, anesthetic sprays and such. I think I was most disappointed that it takes FOREVER to get all the hair. By forever I mean like 2 hours or more. I think if you really want the most out of this product you&#x27;d be best to really stick with it and use it frequently. Make sure you get all the hair you can the first few times, and then use it to touch up where you notice the hair growing in. That or treat it like a once-in-a-while \\&quot;reset\\&quot; for when the tips of your hair become more noticeable when shaving. This will thin them out so shaving is much quicker and easier. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it. I&#x27;d say this is the go-to product if you&#x27;re curious about epilators because at least if you find it&#x27;s not the solution for you, you still have a decent shaver with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d seen these a couple times and was sort of tired of shaving and wanted something that lasted longer.....    This one was way cheap and had great reviews! So i bought it.    Well, if you have very thin sparse hair definitely go for it! I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s great for any small hairs or fuzz on my lower back and upper shoulders, as well as cleaning up spots you may have missed shaving, but it&#x27;s just TOO painful to do your entire legs or even arms.    The addition of a shaver is nice if you need it.    If you want to see what epilating is like, get it! It was worth the money to try it, and i still use it in small areas every now and then to clean up... but it won&#x27;t be replacing shaving for me sadly :&#x27;(.</li>
    <li> This product does it&#x27;s job, it&#x27;s a good epilator. However, I don&#x27;t like how this device feels. The dark pink areas (on the side and the on/off switch) are really sticky, and really hard to clean! Your hairs get stuck on it, and it just gets dirty! Plus, I hate how it makes my hands sticky! I would recommend you look for another epilator.</li>
    <li> I got this Revlon epilator to replace the Braun I had been using before my puppy chewed the cord. I really don&#x27;t have that much hair on my legs anymore since I have been using epilators since the infamous Epilady of the 1980&#x27;s that I got in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great! I got every hair on my lower legs, which is the area that I bought it for. I cannot attest to the hair removing capabilities of my underarms or bikini area since the last time I tried (with the Braun) I couldn&#x27;t stand the horrific pain or the subsequent blood loss. But, and here&#x27;s where the Revlon shines in my eyes, it has a SHAVER on the other end! I was actually able to remove ALL of the hair I would usually shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the minus side, the epilator side doesn&#x27;t have the larger tweezing head that my last unit had, so it took a little bit longer, but for the price I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> For such a cheap price, I think that this is a pretty good epilator. I&#x27;ve used it on underarms, legs and bikini. You definitely need to go over areas a couple times before you get all the hairs out. It doesn&#x27;t really hurt in my opinion. It is, however, pretty annoying to use on the legs because it misses a lot of the shorter hairs, even I think that they are at the length where its noticable.</li>
    <li> This is the best little investment ever! Having this at home means you can always be ready to go out go swimming and feel smooth and clean. Have it for 2 years and loving it! Never had a saloon appointment after this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for years and bought this one when my last one died. It&#x27;s a very good little machine. The curved head does a good job around knees and ankles, and even underarms (you just have to move it in several directions, that&#x27;s all). The motor isn&#x27;t as powerful as some others, but on the plus side, this epilator is, in fact, quite gentle. I read the reviews stating the pink plastic melted, but I&#x27;ve not had that problem -- take a break and let the motor cool off if you&#x27;ve been working so long that the whole machine feels warm to the touch. I would recommend this epilator, especially to someone who is just trying this hair removal method.</li>
    <li> This can remove some hair in certain patches OK, but it&#x27;s totally hit or miss. First, most of the hair it pulls gets broken, so it&#x27;s barely better than shaving. Second, even on the highest setting, you have to run it over your skin like a million times for it to pick up everything. Third, after using it for a year or so, the rubber on this thing became insanely sticky and gross. I ended up just throwing it in the trash and going back to razor and tweezers for all my needs.</li>
    <li> I love mine. I have over a year and still works perfectly. I totally recommend it. It&#x27;s awesome for me because I can&#x27;t use razors.</li>
    <li> I use this item on the advice of a female friend.  It hurts a little at first but I definately love the convenience over shaving.  Will continue to use this item for years to come.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing. When I used it, the hair would begin growing back slower. This was after the 5th use. The immediate thing I noticed was that there weren&#x27;t any ingrown hairs so I didn&#x27;t have to deal with any pimples, swelling, or blackheads because of the ingrown hair. I love this device. It seems to last for a long time. My only advice is that the dark pink handle is easy to get dirty so you need to handle this with care. Keep it clean and away from dirt. The moment the dark pink handle part gets dirty, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to clean. It just feels dirty too. Ick. Just take care of it and you&#x27;ll be fine :)</li>
    <li> Awesome epilator and the razor is good too.  Unfortunately after 3 years the epilator is starting to fail.  I wish they still made these because I would buy another one to replace it.</li>
