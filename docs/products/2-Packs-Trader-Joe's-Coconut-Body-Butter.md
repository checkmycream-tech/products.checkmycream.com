<li> A Jar lasted me about 9 mos... not to say everyone will get that time frame out of it, because I don&#x27;t use every single day...</li>
<li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
<li> It is extremely moisturizing without the greasy feeling of other products.  </li>

    <li> My daughter came across this product at Trader Joes and swears by its effectiveness. Your skin will feel softer, smoother and moisturized!  Love this!  Would definitely recommend to everyone! Try it once and you will be a believer in its properties!  Way to go Trader Joes!</li>
    <li> I purchased it thinking that is was natural and/organic but it has way more ingredients than I expected. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I will try it.</li>

    <li> I love this body butter. Unfortunately my order arrived too late and I could not take it with me while abroad on vacation. But. i can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
    <li> Trader joes coconut body butter is awesome the smell is great it feels wonderful will buy it again over and over</li>
    <li> It was okay. I still have an entire container left out of the bundle after having it for four months. I didn&#x27;t fall in love with it. The texture and smell did not do anything for me. I may give the second one away in a gift basket. It is not horrible, I just personally did not love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this item!!  It really does moisturize well without being greasy.  I will be buying more.  I&#x27;ve even used it on the ends of my hair and it works nicely!!</li>
    <li> smells and feels wonderful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice, thick lotion.  It&#x27;s not a butter. Very strong coconut smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have found in many years. I am addicted to the light and non greasy texture and the smell. I am looking forward to trying the other flavors.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Was not near a trader joe&#x27;s to buy so ordering was a snap.  Bought some for my friend and she loved it too.</li>
    <li> I love this cream .I use it on my face helps with softening wrinkles</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s creamy and non greasy. I can put it on and have smooth skin for days, so I don&#x27;t have to continue putting it on all the time. A Jar lasted me about 9 mos... not to say everyone will get that time frame out of it, because I don&#x27;t use every single day... but, it did last me a long time and I liked it so much, I bought two more jars.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells delicious, like a sweet yummy frosting(so if that isn&#x27;t your thing probably should not buy this). Very creamy and thick. A little goes a long ways. I have psoriasis and I find that it helps keep the redness down and keeps it from getting all flaky as well. It soaks in without leaving a greasy feeling. The sweet smell does disappear after a little while so no fear if you don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a sweet cup cake all day.</li>
