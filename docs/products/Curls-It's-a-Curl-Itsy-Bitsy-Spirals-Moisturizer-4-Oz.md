      <li>My granddaughters have uncontrollable curls--especially with static electricity in the winter.  </li>
      <li>This product works wonderfully on actually freezing the curl pattern so that her curls are perfectly defined.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand for all hair products for my kids.</li>
      <li>It does moisturize ok.  </li>
      <li>wish it was more quantity of the bottle</li>
      <li>I am not seeing any better results on my babies curls than just wetting them with water.</li>
      <li>Curl types and hair textures vary but this product works great for my son&#x27;s soft, kinky spiral curls.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer makes it easy for me to comb my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I thought this all natural product would be good.</li>
      <li>Good product for my one year old with curly hair.  </li>
      <li>However, I can get better results with applying a very very smail amount of baby oil or baby lotion to her hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unique or anything special for &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.  </li>
      <li>This product smells nice and is not heavy.  </li>
      <li>My 10 month old&#x27;s curls really get some nice definition and are more manageable with this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I usually lightly mist her hair with a spray bottle first</li>
      <li>she has very curly hair that easily frizz</li>
      <li>I also use the Ring around the Curlies product by this same company and love it!</li>
      <li>That was the reason I bought it in the first place.</li>
      <li>When I first put it in her hair, her curls become well defined and mosturized.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time that I have seen a reaction like this on her since she has been born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner in this brand especially.</li>
      <li>First the bottle was too small for the price however if it was a good product it would be worth it.</li>
      <li>Because of the softness of his hair, it mats down and gets tangled when he sleeps and this product works as a great daily curl refresher to detangle and define his curls.  </li>
      <li>Very watery.  </li>
      <li>This product is very watery and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize.</li>
      <li>It works just as well for older kids as it does for babies.</li>
      <li>i was excite to try it till i saw that If thats normal for this product i wont order again</li>
      <li>The only reason for one star off is that the first ingredient is water.  </li>
      <li>However, fast forward two hours or so, they dry out a bit but not as much as it would have</li>
      <li>This is a great solution--we like to use it when they come in from the cold and take off their hats.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Stick with the ultra gentle stuff until baby is old enough to use stronger products.  </li>
      <li>Her hair texture is a mixture of soft curls and medium texture curls, she is biracial.  </li>
      <li>I now use the Itsy Bitsy Spirals on my youngest daughter(2yrs old).  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like putting products in a 3 month old&#x27;s hair, so</li>
      <li>frizz for my 2 year old</li>
      <li>For some reason I thought this line was natural and had no synthetic fragrance</li>
      <li>I have used the Curls products for years on my oldest daughter(9yrs old).</li>
      <li>Her hair stays soft and the curl pattern stays defined all day.  </li>
      <li>It actually dried his hair out more and left white residue in his curls!</li>
      <li>The next day my 6-month old daughter&#x27;s precious little head was itching, red, she had rash all around the back of her neck, head, chest.  </li>
      <li>i only wish it was 100% all natural</li>
      <li>My daughter is a 3 month old red head with tigh curls that get dry and frizzy when her hair/curls are combed.  </li>

    <li> This moisturizer makes it easy for me to comb my daughter&#x27;s hair. If i wait too long it dries out though which happens occasionally with a squirmy baby who does not want her hair combed.</li>
    <li> smelly and not effective</li>
    <li> This product is very watery and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize.</li>
    <li> Curl types and hair textures vary but this product works great for my son&#x27;s soft, kinky spiral curls.  Because of the softness of his hair, it mats down and gets tangled when he sleeps and this product works as a great daily curl refresher to detangle and define his curls.  I use the shampoo and conditioner as well as the leave-in as well.  Great products!</li>
    <li> I had just given my baby a bath...excited to have something for her curls...and...WOW! This product has a very bad smell!!!... I had to wash her all over again!&lt;br /&gt;Too bad...&#x27;cause it&#x27;s not easy to find natural products for curls...&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion:...maybe a \\&quot;lavander\\&quot; fragrance would help...</li>
    <li> My daughter is a 3 month old red head with tigh curls that get dry and frizzy when her hair/curls are combed.  I don&#x27;t like putting products in a 3 month old&#x27;s hair, so I thought this all natural product would be good. This product smells nice and is not heavy.  It does moisturize ok.  However, I can get better results with applying a very very smail amount of baby oil or baby lotion to her hair.  This product did not define or maintain the curls in her hair at all.  I am looking to maintain &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; and this product did not do this for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I think this moisturizer can be used on any hair type.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unique or anything special for &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great stuff works great keeps away frizz for my 2 year old she has very curly hair that easily frizz wish it was more quantity of the bottle but a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> it does curl your hair but left my daughter hair extremely extremely dry would not recommend as a moisturizer daughter is African American 18 months coarse hair</li>
    <li> I used this product in addition to the entire product line for It&#x27;s a Curl!  The next day my 6-month old daughter&#x27;s precious little head was itching, red, she had rash all around the back of her neck, head, chest.  I felt completely terrible and that it was all my fault for trying to use something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will go away, I had to get a prescription for hydrocordisone, 2.5% to help with the itch and to reduce the redness and bumps.  This is the first time that I have seen a reaction like this on her since she has been born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the ultra gentle stuff until baby is old enough to use stronger products.  I&#x27;m completely disappointed in this product!!!  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I made!</li>
    <li> My 10 month old&#x27;s curls really get some nice definition and are more manageable with this moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner and wash as well and the results are great.  It smells great too!</li>
    <li> I have used the Curls products for years on my oldest daughter(9yrs old). I now use the Itsy Bitsy Spirals on my youngest daughter(2yrs old).  This product works wonderfully on actually freezing the curl pattern so that her curls are perfectly defined. There is no frizz at all in her hair when I use this product. I usually lightly mist her hair with a spray bottle first and then I use the Itsy Bitsy Sprials all over her head (sparingly).  Her hair stays soft and the curl pattern stays defined all day.  Her hair texture is a mixture of soft curls and medium texture curls, she is biracial.  I also use the Ring around the Curlies product by this same company and love it!</li>
    <li> First the bottle was too small for the price however if it was a good product it would be worth it. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work well as I thought. It did make my son&#x27;s curls a little curlier however it did nothing for moisturizing!! That was the reason I bought it in the first place. It actually dried his hair out more and left white residue in his curls! Not a good product I would not recommend it!</li>
    <li> My granddaughters have uncontrollable curls--especially with static electricity in the winter.  This is a great solution--we like to use it when they come in from the cold and take off their hats.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for infants with curly hair!</li>
    <li> JUST GOT THIS AS A GIFT AND IT WAS SEALED AND HALF EMPTY and so watered .....i wish i could return it but it was a gift so i said thinks ( didnt know about it being almost empty till i got home) i was excite to try it till i saw that If thats normal for this product i wont order again</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair soaks this up and I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement to the dryness since I&#x27;ve been using it.  The only reason for one star off is that the first ingredient is water.  For $15 dollars for a small bottle, I&#x27;d expect a little more product and less water- I&#x27;d rather use it sparingly or thin it myself; I usually apply it to wet hair anyway.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely watery product yet it is not in a spray. I am not seeing any better results on my babies curls than just wetting them with water. Would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product been using it since my daughter was around 6 months gives her curls life and shine and smells good i only wish it was 100% all natural</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand for all hair products for my kids. It works just as well for older kids as it does for babies. Love the shampoo and conditioner in this brand especially.</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought this line was natural and had no synthetic fragrance but that was not the case. I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell and synthetic fragrance breaks my daughter out so unfortunately this product was a waste of my $.</li>
    <li> Good product for my one year old with curly hair.  When I first put it in her hair, her curls become well defined and mosturized.  However, fast forward two hours or so, they dry out a bit but not as much as it would have, had I not used it.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  Very watery.  Provides no moisture</li>
    <li> I tell everyone about this product line. My daughter is white/black and has the best hair ever!! People always ask about her adorable curls. This is my secret weapon ;o). It gives the wet look and makes spiral curls, I fluff it out and she has perfect curls all day.</li>
