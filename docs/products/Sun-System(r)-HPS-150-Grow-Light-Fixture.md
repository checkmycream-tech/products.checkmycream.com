      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the outcome of my veggies, Already planning on ordering more fixtures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>IS, by far the best investment you can make if this wattage light is sufficcient.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, I know better, no it didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
      <li>Quality light!</li>
      <li>The ballast is consuming most of the power...</li>
      <li>Everything arrived in in great shape and ready to plug in and use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All I can say is wow. My babies love this light. GREAT for flower. Shipped fast and mint condition!</li>
    <li> This light is all that it was advertised as, though it was a little smaller than it looks. It does a great job, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is better than i expected, stay cool durable and compact. Exactly what i needed. Would buy another one in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> Very happy, at this price it&#x27;s hard to be unhappy at all. Shipped quicker than expected, clean bulb pre installed and thoughtfully packaged with care. Peppers love this light&#x27;s sun-like-glow and warmth. Helps keep my peppers warm in the space over the garage. I can say with confidence it will grow anything that can fit under it at about 12-18\\&quot; from plant tops in maybe a 4x4 area. Combined with LEDs to get incredible results.A+</li>
    <li> It grows your plants but needs to be a bigger light</li>
    <li> This light is perfect for small-area gardening. It comes with a bulb which is awesome! I was so impressed I purchased a 2nd one. Perfect for a grow area from 4&#x27;x4&#x27; to 6&#x27;x6&#x27;. Quiet ballast, minimal heat give off, sturdy and well constructed. Has a grounded 18AWG power cord that&#x27;s 7&#x27; long with thick sheathing. I was very surprised at the amount of light for how small the unit is.</li>
    <li> My orchids are growing and blooming surprisingly well under this light system .</li>
    <li> Very bright great for getting your veggie seeds a head start</li>
    <li> Did not work probably defective</li>
    <li> recived my product very fast...actualy faster than the quoted time..  i would and will order from amazon and growfresh again..  the light kicks butt and am very excited to use it.  thank you very much amazon/growfresh</li>
    <li> the packaging of product the company that sent it asked extra for better packaging, a total joke the only thing they did was put a label on box \\&quot; handle with care\\&quot; , no bubble wrap at all.packaging  was very poor!!!  it was a wonder that the light arrived unbroken,only a sticker\\&quot; handle with care\\&quot; was on the outside of a cheap cardboard box, no bubble wrap or any kind of a protection wrap, very sad, nothing was done to protect light from damage,during shipment!!!</li>
    <li> Great light for the price.  It helps my 30 or so vegetable garden seedlings grow. I built a box with that foam board that looks like foil on one side.  It keeps the heat in and keeps the light down in the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few small plants or doing seedlings, this seems like the perfect product. I&#x27;ve recommended it to several other gardeners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cons, its really bright.  As in really hurts your eyes bright.  Not sure this is really a con, but a caution.  This is part of the reason I put foam around it.  My kids would go stare at it.  Any room you have it in will be lit up.  Its also a bit hot, but all you have to do is not let it get too close to the plants.  I have mine about 18&amp;#34; above the seedlings and they are growing great but not getting fried.</li>
    <li> this light works perfect for a small area 1 1/2ft x 1 1/2ft. perfect for starting seeds or keeping a small mother plant! surprisingly puts off some heat, so if that&#x27;s an issue than t-5 florescence might be a better option. love the light and would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I grow Saltwater Coral and need different spectums of light.  This works for my Algae srubber tank with great result.  DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR REEF TANK- will cause green and brown algae bloom.  Use Metal Halide of 10k temp for tanks.  Other than that, cheaper than actual fish tank lights.  WARNING- SALT WATER Hit the bulb and BOOM. I should have been more careful as it sent glass everywhere.  Yes, I know better, no it didn&#x27;t help.  Still like the light, but my bad.</li>
    <li> works great best price</li>
    <li> works goodto sex clones</li>
    <li> Wow!  For the price this product is a steal.  I know for my indoor grow room I needed more watts but since I&#x27;m quite cheap person bought this instead. The results: planes are growing at a faster rate and strong.  I use it for 1-4plants and it&#x27;s been providing enough light!</li>
    <li> Well-made unit, comes with a good bulb. Plug it in, it works, and the plants under it have been happy all winter.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!! Dynamite really does come in small packages. Outstanding grow light. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for more than 4 plants.</li>
    <li> Buying the Sun System light was a good investment. It was easy to install and works great. I plant a garden every year but I start from seed in the house first. I had no ideal room for it as far as sunlight was concerned so it was always slow growing at first. This year with the sun lamp everything is ready for transplant early and it didn&#x27;t really add anything noticeable to the electric bill! I would definitely recommend the Sun System HPS 150 to anyone living in a northern state that likes to garden (whether that be flower or vegeatable).</li>
    <li> Very good and fast service</li>
    <li> The ballast quit within 3 days, and I sent it back for a refund... Really good while it worked though</li>
    <li> Great little light I bought it for a grow tent and is perfect for any small area. I prefer the air cooled hoods but for an HID lamp it really does not produce excess heat and good lumen output.</li>
    <li> very well built design. my plants just started accelerating when i ut this light on them. they were just under a regular light until i could find an affordable light fixture. they were still very small. i got this 150 watt hps light and the plants grew so fast you can almost watch them grow. leave your plant alone for a day and when you come back you will see a difference. and the light came in an unmarked amazon box witch is amazing.  gets very hot and fast though. if left alone for about an hour it got soo hot i couldnt hold my hand on it. i got a small quiet fan and hooked it up in my tent and it runs like i only dreames of. puts off enough heat to keep my plants happy, while not burning them or eating all the moisture in the air. great buy just get a fan.</li>
    <li> LIGHT IS VERY VERY WELL MADE BUILT IN FAN AND EVERYTHING. PACKING WAS GREAT. JUST BE CAREFUL OF THE HEAT. NEEDS A SMALLER BULB FOR SEEDLINGS BUT I&#x27;LL ADJUST. QUALITY PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed. Anything larger than about 5sq ft, go with a bigger lamp or more than one of these. If you have a smaller area and are just looking to grow a small supply of... Whatever, this lamp works great.</li>
    <li> I use this lamp when starting my seedlings and getting my vegetable and herb garden ready for spring. Covers a 2x2 space very nicely with a very warm, bright light. There are more efficient options out there to cover larger area&#x27;s, but this fits my needs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one before this five years ago when I first started gardening and had no issues other than the main switch going out at the beginning of this season. A quick trip to radio shack to get a switch and crimp connectors fixed it back up and working perfectly again.</li>
    <li> Not sure you can find a better deal on a similar performing light. We use it for to mature seedlings in the spring and it works great.</li>
    <li> This quietly and efficiently kept my plants alive and thriving indoors during this last winter.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It was much cheaper than anything we could find at Home Depot or Lowe&#x27;s too!</li>
    <li> I find this light and fixture easy to use. I like to grow vegetables inside during cold months here in the Midwest. This light is perfect for tomatoes and salad greens.</li>
    <li> Best buy around and works great..</li>
    <li> I HAVE MUCH LARGER FLOWERS SINCE I GOT THIS LIGHT.  BUT IT DOES PUT OUT A LOT OF HEAT, I DID BUY A SECOND ONE THE NEXT MONTH</li>
    <li> Have had this for about 6 weeks for my hydroponic garden I am trying and so far no complaints other than the weight of it.</li>
    <li> Light works very well worth every penny! Will For Sure buy Another One For My Indoor Garden! My Plants Are Growing Like Crazy!</li>
    <li> I compared this to my 150w hps Hydrofarm fixture even swapped bulbs... The sun 150w hps draws significantly!!!!! Less amperage than the hydro farm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunsystem &#x3D; 1.5a or less after 60 min running&lt;br /&gt;Hydrofarm &#x3D;  3.8a or MORE after 60 min running&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the sunsystem takes less to make 150w of light much less! The Hydrofarm takes about 300-400w to make 150w of light. The ballast is consuming most of the power...</li>
    <li> I have a 20 X 20 4-season sun room on my house. But if you want flowers all year, you need a separate grow room, where you can keep the light at 12 on, 12 off, which is what most plants need to flower.  So I have a 4 x 4  flowering box in my heated garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this year has been exceptionally cold in my area, and my box was not getting up to a good flowering temp with the existing 150 watt HPS I built myself, during the light on time, so I bought this to add more light, and temperature without upping the garages temp. It worked perfectly, and brought the temperature up to 79 degrees, and the plants couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well constructed light, and the price is great. The 150 watt light I already had in the box, I built myself, and probably spent just as much to make mine, as this cost, and it came with a light bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High pressure sodium lights have a color temperature that is great for flowering plants but they are hot!  Adding this light to my 4 x 4 box with the existing 150 watt light raised the temperature 20 degrees, when the garage temp was 40 degrees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a really small growing area, the heat this light puts off is something you should consider before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But take it from a 45-year grower who has built his own HPS, and MH lights from 70 to a 1,000 watts....this is a well constructed light that would be hard to beat at any price.</li>
    <li> Got to me early got to plug it in and fire it up so stoke to replace the led I was using for a hps</li>
    <li> This little hps lamp is great for an indoor garden.  Gets warm but not too hot.  Can be used for a side light..  Fixture is durable and much better price than the grow shops in town.</li>
    <li> This light is self contained and sturdy.  It is not beautiful but it is nice enough that I use it in my office.  It does not require any external equipment to use - just a power cord.  That said, you do have to come up with a mounting solution for it but that was easily done with some line and a couple of eye bolts in the ceiling.</li>
    <li> I bought this under a recommendation from a book that liked it but I found that it is too hot and will burn a tomato plant if left less that two feet away. This would be a good system for keeping baby birds warm but not for plants. My brother raises chickens and he will be getting this for Christmas from me. If I had a green thumb I would give this a chance.</li>
    <li> We bought this light for starting our vegetable plants ourselves instead of buying them from the greenhouse. I doubt we are saving any money this way, but our main objective was to get away from the hybrids that are sold commercially. So far this light is doing a great job. I gave it 4 stars only because we&#x27;ve had it for 1 month and don&#x27;t know yet about it&#x27;s longevity. Our tomatoes, peppers look every bit as good as the ones at the greenhouse.</li>
    <li> I am thinking about purchasing this to start our garden this year. I used some lower-end T5&#x27;s last year and received negative results. With the cold months sometimes extending into our growing season, it can be very difficult to get our vegetables moving on time when grown directly outdoors. I am hoping this will suffice!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its the shock of bringing my plants from growing outside and then putting them in a grow tent under this light, but my plants are suffering from either over heating/shock/ or over watering. they were fine when i first put them in there they looked beautiful and after the first day i started to see them look like they were wilting and then this morning the leaves looked so thin and wilted. I don&#x27;t know what to do. I have 1 fan in the grow tent and i left the front door open towards the top so a lot of heat could escape. If my plants weren&#x27;t doing so bad i would give this a higher score but technically its doing its job lighting up the tent. I just was expecting different results.</li>
    <li> Amazed at the small amount of heat this lamp puts out; it&#x27;s nothing like the traditional HPS&#x27; that I&#x27;m using. Will be getting more!</li>
    <li> This product is performing exactly as it should, very simple to set up and works great for the price paid it is exceptional.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, working great on my plumeria cutting.</li>
    <li> if you want lots of heat and a little light this is the one!!  I do use it for the warming effect sometimes</li>
    <li> At first, I got this light for a friend of my Mom. She had some issue where the light would work for only 4 hours at a time-then cut out..So, I have been using it for the past Six weeks  and am BEYOND PLEASED to report that this light is AWESOME!~. BECAUSE it comes with a 150 watt HPS bulb-which, by itself is between $20 and $40-it IS, by far the best investment you can make if this wattage light is sufficcient.&lt;br /&gt;INITIALLY-I thought there was a ballast problem but after contacting the Manufacturer-they diagnosed the issue as a faulty bulb..And sent me a new one at NO charge. OTHER than my inexperience in using this type of enclosed-ballast-light, I had NO clue about the \\&quot;care and feeding\\&quot; of an HPS bulb.(DO NOT TOUCH &#x27;EM with your BARE hands)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an eclosed environment-this light is only a bit luke-warm, but beneficially so. A small fan, pointed AT the light is adequate.NEVER USE THIS in an enclosed are (like a TENT) unless you also have a fan.&lt;br /&gt; It is quite efficient, VERY SILENT and uses VERY LITTLE power. (As much as a 150 watt incandescent bulb)&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT have, nor does it need, a glass cover-THOSE are only to be used with an MH light.&lt;br /&gt;It is light enough (about 9 pounds) to be hung directly over your starters or sprouts.&lt;br /&gt;(The ONLY comment is that I WISH it came with the \\&quot;yo-yo\\&quot; hangers that allow this to be moved up or down effortlessly-&lt;br /&gt;BUT in light of the FREE BULB-this is one truly awesome value~</li>
    <li> Absolutely great light. Very low heat, would still use small fan to keep from getting to hot to touch. Built solid and long cord. Enough light coverage for about 2&#x27; by 2&#x27; space. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Perfect Small herb garden light, nothing wrong with it. Quality light!</li>
    <li> This light is supposed to be 150 watts, correct? Yes and no. Well it draws 3.3 amps continuously and given the equation watts&#x3D;ampsXvolts, watts&#x3D;3.3X120 so watts is actually around 390. In other words, VA&#x3D;390 which is what most power companies will charge you for while your product will be consuming 150 \\&quot;watts\\&quot; which is true. You are paying the same as you would be running a 400 watt electronic ballast.</li>
    <li> This is a good light in a pinch. Or for just maintaining some very small plants. For the price, $50 more will usually get you a 400-600 watt system that would grow plants a lot faster.  This is not bad, just definitely only a 150 watt.  and makes a bit more heat then i would expect also.</li>
    <li> The Sun System HPS 150 is a perfect product for growing plants in small areas by creating more visible light per unit of electric power consumed than other lights . I am currently using mine in a grow box for strawberries, basil, hot peppers, and tomatoes.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I needed a low watt hps for a small grow tent and this did the trick. Plenty of light with minimal heat. Don&#x27;t even notice it on the electric bill.</li>
    <li> I just received the Sun System 150w Grow fixture with bulb today. I was surprised how well it was made. It is pretty much a self contained unit. Came with the cord and bulb completely undamaged. At first i was disappointed cause i pretty much took it out of the box and plugged it in to see how bright it was, but the light wasn&#x27;t screwed in so i thought it was broken. Anyways i screwed in the bulb [WITH A GLOVE] cause you shouldnt touch the bulb with your bare hands because the oil in your skin can cause the bulb to warp over time. VERY IMPORTANT!!!. Anyways after it started up for 5 minutes the light was magnificent. Extremely bright with very very little heat. Honestly the Package says this is good for a 2ft x 2ft garden but in reality i think it could cover a garden of 2 or 3 plants max but at least 3ft x 3ft. Yes the light really is that bright. Anyways my plants are seeming to love their new energy source as they are in the flowering &amp;#34;Budding&amp;#34; stage. Great light cheap price. Cant beat that...</li>
    <li> In bought this unit to give me supplemental light for my seedlings in my green house and It works great. I only wish I had bought a larger unit as I have outgrown my green house. Everything arrived in in great shape and ready to plug in and use. Shipping was right on the money. I ordered on a Thursday expecting it to arrive an Monday but it came a couple of days early and was here Saturday morning by 10 am.&lt;br /&gt;Great job and great product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Where to start?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well first off I&#x27;ll start with some information since there seems to be some confusion on that. On start up the electric use is vague at best my best guess is 380w. Now once warm the manual clearly says it runs at 165w continuously. So for those worried there gonna get screwed on a inefficient light don&#x27;t worry. It should cover an area of 2&#x27;x2&#x27; growing area. Depending on conditions in your grow room you can mount it over your canopy anywhere form 8-18&amp;#34;. Overall temperatures in the room and how hardy your plants will decide that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now why did I rate it so high? Simple bang for the buck. The quality of the construction is fantastic. I saw the 9lbs shipping weight and somehow expected it to be a poorly builtor flimsy but decided to give it a chance given other reviews. In person it actually feels heavier, although I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just in my head,but I had to rethink how I was going to hang. I ended up going with a cheapo $8 chain from Home Depot and some freebie hardware I had around the house. The reflector does a good job. It is dimpled for best effect. The cooling fins keep it running cool to the touch on the housing (never touch the bulb for any reason). For those in hotter running rooms or cabs it looks like a computer fan could be rigged on the vents on the light side. Haven&#x27;t tried but something to think about. Power cord is nice and thick (120v).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard from others more experienced with hps the bulb could be better but coming from CFLs to this there is a huge difference. I would buy it again and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> works great for all plants that like the red spectrum light that High Pressure Sodium lights put out. it will grow any plant but research to see if you may want a Metal Halide lamp instead. great product</li>
    <li> This light will be perfect for starting our tomatoes and bell peppers inside before we move them out into full sun.</li>
    <li> This light does a fine job and works just as well as the 450 watt hps light in my view.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for a beginner.. I use this lamp in a 2 x 2 x 6 box and it works perfectly. I had an issue with shipping though.. I recieved my bulb smashed in the box. I emailed 1000 bulbs and they sent a new one right away for free.</li>
    <li> Awesome for two tomato plants and not to bad on the electric bill. I plan on using Sun System products for my whole indoor garden.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected from this system very good couldn&#x27;t ask for a better light system , look forward to more products like this</li>
    <li> the best! &amp; with a small fan theres really no heat at all.</li>
    <li> Light is great. Saw immediate improvement in blooms. Heat from lamp is not bad. Great little light for 1-2 plants.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these lights for the greenhouse and used an automatic timer to turn on and off. They work so well and easy to hang.  Monica</li>
    <li> Worked well very satisfied</li>
    <li> In a 3 X 5 space it only required a small fan, and good lumens per watt. A cost saver. I  recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this light to replace 4 24&amp;#34; flourscent tubes and 4 cfl&#x27;s and i am so glad i did. This light is awesome and great quality,  i have noticed a huge improvement. Great seller and very fast discrete shipping. I recieved the light 3 days after ordering. Highly recommended for a small area!</li>
    <li> I ordered two so I could bring pond plants in for the winter. So far, plants seem to love the light. Heavy duty construction. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> This light works better than I expected. it&#x27;s very bright and almost completely silent. and it&#x27;s easy to control the heat . It&#x27;s very well made I love it</li>
    <li> its bright only problem is the fact I hade to glue case fans to each end push air acrost bulb. cooling is a issue have fun rigging it up I dint ! works good on 3 plants a I have 2 90 w ufo to deff help</li>
    <li> i purchased this for a back up light for just in case something ever messed up. i am surprised how well built this light system is.</li>
    <li> Does its job admirably!  I have an apartment with a North facing sliding glass door that provide all my useful outdoor light.  My orchids were of course suffering.  So, when I installed this light they all came back strong and healthy.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, works great! Can&#x27;t wait to see the outcome of my veggies, Already planning on ordering more fixtures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/2/13&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second unit and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I&#x27;m growing 12 different potted vegetables indoors and they are all loving it! Beautiful lush leaves, can&#x27;t wait to see the end results!</li>
    <li> self contained unit at a good price.we priced the bulbs before we bought it.this unit don&#x27;t come with any hardware for hanging is the only draw back or we didn&#x27;t get the hooks with ours</li>
    <li> this lamp worked wonderfully for me. i used it in an unheated attic in winter for 3 or 4 seasons. it never failed to produce. if you buy it, you WON&#x27;T be sorry. highest recommendations for indoor plant growers. the price is right and so is this lamp.</li>
    <li> I bought this light to supplement my existing grow lighting (my tree outgrew the lighting area). I&#x27;m in a Northern climate and have an orange tree that has to come indoors for the winter.  This light does a great job providing light, and it doesn&#x27;t generate allot of heat. The areas of the tree that this light is shining on actually seems greener than where the other lights (t-5 high output) are hitting. The fixture is fairly light and the hangers that come with it are more than adequate for the task. I&#x27;m more than happy with this lighting and if I need additional supplemental light (down the road) I&#x27;ll be looking for another one of these fixtures</li>
    <li> I also have a T-5 fluorescent fixture from Sun Systems and plan on staying put.  I feel like this light with be with me for years to come, as has the flour. fixture. Great products in  my experience!</li>
    <li> So far it works great!</li>
    <li> Sun System® HPS 150 Grow Light Fixture - Shipping Was fast and very safe, everything came as described.&lt;br /&gt;this grow light is great for a small tent or closet, covers a 2 x 2 area pretty well,&lt;br /&gt;noticed major improvement of plant growth in only a week, recently was using a single 65w CFL bulb.</li>
    <li> The item arrived as described. Been using for 5 weeks with no problems so far. Ordered a second a few days ago</li>
    <li> Very heavy...so make sure it&#x27;s installed securely. Only had mine two thus far and is working well.</li>
    <li> The fixture was manufactured in 2008. Sold as used, I bought it? It works !!! Still I will buy a new bulb, The old one has some hours on it. It&#x27;s used. Being cheap is expensive. Every thing new cost $10 more.But an education always cost something... It does work. The packing and packaging done very well. It works !!!!</li>
    <li> Used for growing dwarf tomatoes (tumbler hybrid) indoors.  Good growth over two plants and over 100 cherry tomatoes produced.  Bulb seems to last around a year, but is easy to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> My garden plants are growing like crazy. The light isn&#x27;t too hot and doesn&#x27;t bath the room in light, just the plants.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get too hot, puts out a fair amount of light, consumes less energy than I thought it would and my plants are responding well to it. The only concern was that the bulb itself was poorly constructed. The bulb works fine, but it sits in its socket boot at an odd angle... as if it weren&#x27;t properly seated. Bad quality control... but it still works.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these to use in my basement as my primary grow lights. They work as advertised. The product came perfectly intact with brand new bulbs. I&#x27;ve been using them almost constantly for a year and I still have not had to replace any bulbs.  They grow my vegetables and herbs perfectly. They also don&#x27;t give off that much heat. My grow area was getting hotter when I was loading it up with CFL&#x27;s than it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for growing, they seem to have grown everything fine. Don&#x27;t expect these to perform like the 1000 watt HPS lights, but for a small grow operation, they will work just fine and give you great yields.</li>
    <li> Great product does every thing that it says it does. recommend to your family and friends! Would buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Very high output for a 150 watts.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get. Plug in and go. Bulb came screwed in and in working order couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Came assembled and ready to plug n!!! Great for a small grow room to change the light spectrum for your plants!!! ;) this is a must have for small time growers like myself. If u have a big room or lots of plants you can order a few of these or just this and a 1000 watt bulb.</li>
