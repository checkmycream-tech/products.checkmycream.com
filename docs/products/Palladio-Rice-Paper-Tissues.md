      <li>, you can also use it on top of makeup and it won&#x27;t ruin anything.  </li>
      <li>;p man that actually saved me :D</li>
      <li>I wish they were sold at more places than just Sally&#x27;s though.</li>
      <li>Love the product, but I can find this cheaper at Sally&#x27;s Beauty locations.</li>
      <li>I seriously love these</li>
      <li>I love that they have powder on them</li>
      <li>Would recommend to any oily girl ever :)</li>
      <li>Wish this was available for more than just an add on item.  </li>
      <li>I hope they never change the packaging because I find it really vintage and charming.</li>
      <li>Really good at absorbing excess oil and leaving your skin matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very pretty!</li>
      <li>I love them so much!!  </li>
      <li>They are lightly coated with powder, so they remove oil as well as helping to prevent its return.  </li>
      <li>For women, I&#x27;m sure this is a decent product but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for guys.</li>
      <li>With the Clean &amp; Clear blot sheets (which were my favorite)</li>
      <li>This is currently my new favorite product.</li>
      <li>Really good at picking up oil, nice thick paper, but too much powder for my liking</li>
      <li>They are cheap, work great, and last a long time.  </li>
      <li>Not only does the product work great on bare skin</li>
      <li>But when the weather is very hot I will really test the blotting tissues out.</li>
      <li>I have used many different brands; Clean &amp; Clear, M.A.C., and others...</li>
      <li>i am mid aged and still have very oily skin;  so for me, this works beautifully.  </li>
      <li>i still have to use my own oil control powder, just not as often due to this product.</li>
      <li>They do absorb a lot of oil and are quite large.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t really seem to do anything.</li>
      <li>really like it</li>
      <li>It has a translucent powder on one side that is nice for finishing after blotting with the plain side.</li>
      <li>normally use one or two papers at a time, and use every single millimeter of the first paper (which looks like it just cleaned a frying pan) and use the second paper just to make sure I absorbed</li>
      <li>I was an athlete in high school, and the abundance of oil and sweat and gunk on my face led me to these babies.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>I love how the keep my face matte looking, and they have a little powder</li>
      <li>I just bought these yesterday from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply in hopes that they would work since I recently ran out of the Clean &amp; Clear brand.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s kind of hard to get into the areas around the eyes.</li>
      <li>So far I used them for 2 days and the shine on my face is</li>
      <li>takes off excess oil and provides a soft dusting of finishing powder.  </li>
      <li>they were more like the Clean N Clear oil blotting sheets, but they&#x27;re more like weird thin construction paper that rips when trying to wipe your face.</li>
      <li>These take more oil off my face than the common synthetic blue ones.</li>

    <li> Perfect for mid-day touch ups--package came very quickly.</li>
    <li> Really good at picking up oil, nice thick paper, but too much powder for my liking</li>
    <li> These work perfect and love the after feeling of the powder the only thing is that i felt they should come precut so i had to cut them to smaller pieces and had to store them another place</li>
    <li> Really good at absorbing excess oil and leaving your skin matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use one or two papers at a time, and use every single millimeter of the first paper (which looks like it just cleaned a frying pan) and use the second paper just to make sure I absorbed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was an athlete in high school, and the abundance of oil and sweat and gunk on my face led me to these babies. My mom bought me a pack when I was a freshman, about 8 years ago, and I have never turned back. Would recommend to any oily girl ever :)</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product because of the debris it left on my face. I had to &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; my skin with tissue afterwards and that is not convenient! If you are going to purchase this product, just remember your Kleenex. I won&#x27;t purchase this again because it is inconvenient. I would have given this product five stars if it were not for the debris that it leaves behind. Very messy and not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 , One for home &amp; one for my purse. So far I used them for 2 days and the shine on my face is&lt;br /&gt;a little less. But when the weather is very hot I will really test the blotting tissues out. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for these for so long. I love how the keep my face matte looking, and they have a little powder so you don&#x27;t have to retouch your make up, simply use one tissue and voila! Looking forward to buying them again.</li>
    <li> Wish this was available for more than just an add on item.  I seriously love these but it bums me out that I can&#x27;t buy them without purchasing $25 of other items.  Great product though, I even caught my hubby wiping his face with them!</li>
    <li> These take more oil off my face than the common synthetic blue ones. I love that they have powder on them--it&#x27;s a great midday pick-up for my makeup so my rosacea doesn&#x27;t show through. I&#x27;d especially recommend these to anyone with rosacea, acne, or anything else they cover with concealer/foundation and worry about it showing through later in the day.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but I can find this cheaper at Sally&#x27;s Beauty locations. I wish they were sold at more places than just Sally&#x27;s though.</li>
    <li> This is currently my new favorite product. I use after a workout or a touch up in the middle of the day.  I like the polished look with little effort.</li>
    <li> ;p man that actually saved me :D i just hate to see my nose shiny i just love the matte finish :D and that does it perfectly anytime and anywhere and doesn&#x27;t ruin the make or anything just awesome!! :D</li>
    <li> Always pleased with these</li>
    <li> I stupidly ordered these thinking they were more like the Clean N Clear oil blotting sheets, but they&#x27;re more like weird thin construction paper that rips when trying to wipe your face. Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but it never really looks like the paper is absorbing anything. :/ I&#x27;ve had it in my purse now for a month and I&#x27;ve maybe used them 3 or 4 times... It just doesn&#x27;t really seem to do anything.</li>
    <li> I love these blotting sheets! As a victim of oily skin it&#x27;s hard to keep my makwup lb from looking awkwardly shiny and these sheets keep me matte throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these papers for years, and so has my mother.  I love them so much!!  They are lightly coated with powder, so they remove oil as well as helping to prevent its return.  Not only does the product work great on bare skin, you can also use it on top of makeup and it won&#x27;t ruin anything.  I don&#x27;t use them too often, except in the summer, but I keep them in my purse year &#x27;round because you never know.  I&#x27;ve tried a few others and always end up disappointed, so I just stick to these!  They are cheap, work great, and last a long time.  I hope they never change the packaging because I find it really vintage and charming.</li>
    <li> I have used many different brands; Clean &amp; Clear, M.A.C., and others... I just bought these yesterday from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply in hopes that they would work since I recently ran out of the Clean &amp; Clear brand. And to my amaze these are the best I have ever tried. I highly recommend these. With the Clean &amp; Clear blot sheets (which were my favorite) I was using anywhere from 5 to 8 a day, just to give you an idea. And sometimes I needed two sheets to absorb all the oil. I didn&#x27;t even make a dent in one of these sheets and all the oil was gone. I&#x27;m a happy girl!</li>
    <li> great large sheets&lt;br /&gt;use both sides</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once since I&#x27;ve bought it, but it made my skin look oil-free and matte. Very pretty!</li>
    <li> This paper is thick so it&#x27;s kind of hard to get into the areas around the eyes. It has a translucent powder on one side that is nice for finishing after blotting with the plain side. They do absorb a lot of oil and are quite large. I would just prefer it to be a bit thinner.</li>
    <li> very lovely!  takes off excess oil and provides a soft dusting of finishing powder.  i am mid aged and still have very oily skin;  so for me, this works beautifully.  i still have to use my own oil control powder, just not as often due to this product.</li>
    <li> These rice paper sheets do the trick of sopping up excess oil but in my experience, I have to use several in order to achieve a matte complexion. I&#x27;ve tried to use the powdered side but always seem to notice the powder on my skin. Since I&#x27;m a guy, this is not a great look. For women, I&#x27;m sure this is a decent product but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for guys.</li>
    <li> this is awsome it soaks the oil of your skin like heaven, the seets are big enogh for the face. really like it</li>
    <li> I dislike the powder these leave on my face.</li>
