      <li>After covering them with rhinestones or ribbon, you&#x27;d never guess they were so cheap.  </li>
      <li>light weight..</li>
      <li>and they came out fantastic.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect size for toddlers and small children.</li>
      <li>Just right!  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great price for the quantity you get.</li>
      <li>These came rather quickly.</li>

      <li>Pretty durable!</li>
      <li>They are passable because they fit fine, were really cheap, and I cover them in ribbon, but I was hoping for something that looked more polished and black like the picture.</li>
      <li>These are ok for the price,  but they are not black.</li>
      <li>Needed them for party favors, and the price was right.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>They fit my adult head and my toddler son&#x27;s head as well.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It fit my one-year-old son and my adult head.</li>
      <li>They are more of a gray color and some have splotches of different grays on them...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase because the product is exactly what I expected, black, plastic band, good for wrapping with ribbon.</li>
      <li>I was kinda suprised because they are just plastic, but they were more comfortable then the few premade store bought ears I had.</li>
      <li>I used these and black felt to make a bunch of sets of mickey mouse ears for my daughter&#x27;s bday party, and they fit the kids, and myself, pretty darn comfortably.</li>
      <li>Is a good basic size for ribbon braiding and wide enough for a secure mount for mini hats or fascinators.  </li>
      <li>Nice, plain, plastic headbands.</li>
      <li>They were a little big for some Kg students, but fit most.  </li>
      <li>The plastic is very faded &amp; discolored almost like a white film over them....not happy about the poor quality!</li>
      <li>I used these to create Mickey Mouse ears for my son&#x27;s first birthday (I hot glued black foam paper to the headbands).</li>
      <li>It took a month to receive the headbands but they are perfect for my mad hatter baby shower hats!  </li>
      <li>Order early because they take about a month to receive.</li>
      <li>I even used it one on my 1 year old.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing a plain one right now myself.</li>
      <li>I did hot glue a little piece of felt on the inside at the bottom for cushion when wearing.</li>

<li> and they are a little snug for an adult head in my opinion.</li>
<li> I have purchased both the black and white and they are wide enough to stay put and pliable enough not to bend or break under constant wear.  </li>
<li> Overall, I&#x27;d seek other options.</li>
<li> Although the material is pretty durable for the price, two of the headbands came broken.</li>

<li> the edges of the hair bands are very sharp and could lead to  accidental cuts of a child tender hands or ears.</li>
<li> I used these black plastic headbands to create Minnie Mouse ears for my nieces birthday party.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider them black.</li>
<li> These are 1/2 inch width with a little girth.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> May be bit small for adults.</li>
<li> The broken pieces were completely missing and the remaining piece was too small and too jagged for use.</li>
<li> but my disappointment was the colour they were grey small matters ....</li>
<li> Sturdy and thick.  </li>
<li> I washed them before use because I was a little skeptical.</li>
<li> Sometimes headbands bother kids behind their ears, but these ones stayed on the kids&#x27; heads all day.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how well they would hold up for everyday use, but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
<li> All 36 pieces received non broken!</li>

    <li> I bought these headbands to use for Mickey/Minnie ears for my son&#x27;s party. They were great! Especially for the price. They fit my adult head and my toddler son&#x27;s head as well. Order well in advance because they do take a while to come in. Glad I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> They dont stay in your head..</li>
    <li> These headbands were so great! My first purchase of headbands so I can make beautiful headbands for myself and it was worth it. The price and how many headbands I was making was such a great deal and a perfect package. It&#x27;s easy to wear and comfortable and easy to for do-it-yourself headbands of your own.</li>
    <li> I just needed some cheapie head bands for a craft project and gave these a try.  Just right!  After covering them with rhinestones or ribbon, you&#x27;d never guess they were so cheap.  Great for that Girl Scout project.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend...they have a horrible smell to them...I wouldn&#x27;t consider them black. The plastic is very faded &amp; discolored almost like a white film over them....not happy about the poor quality!</li>
    <li> I must admit theses headbands are strong and well made I love them....but my disappointment was the colour they were grey small matters ....they can be covered with ribbons :)</li>
    <li> Great to make my ladybug ears for party favors!! It was great to find a bundle of headbands at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I use these for making riboon headbands, I also use these as a base under fascinators.  I have purchased both the black and white and they are wide enough to stay put and pliable enough not to bend or break under constant wear.  Is a good basic size for ribbon braiding and wide enough for a secure mount for mini hats or fascinators.  I like these a lot and will be reordering when I run out of my current supply.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed :)</li>
    <li> It took a month to receive the headbands but they are perfect for my mad hatter baby shower hats!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I ordered black bands, but I received dark gray instead...</li>
    <li> Worked what I needed them for. Made Minnie &amp; Mickey mouse headbands for my daughters 1st birthday party I can&#x27;t wait till the day comes</li>
    <li> Ordered for girls to decorate with Duck tape, washbi tape and ribbons.  They have worked great.</li>
    <li> These are ok for the price,  but they are not black. They&#x27;re more like charcoal gray. I washed them before use because I was a little skeptical. Also, be prepared to wait. They gave me a 3-4 week delivery estimate, but they came a little early. I used them for minnie and Mickey mouse ears, which turned out great, but I was close to returning them. Overall, I&#x27;d seek other options.</li>
    <li> light weight.. but, just what I needed added for attaching balloons for hats... and GREAT pirce</li>
    <li> All 36 pieces received non broken! Very sturdy and perfect for what I needed it for! Thanks! Great product at great price!</li>
    <li> I used these to make Minnie/Micky Mouse ears for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party. I used a hot glue gun to stick the scrap booking card stock to the underside and it stuck great. They were a great price and they fit everyone. Toddler girls and boys to adults. I&#x27;m wearing a plain one right now myself.</li>
    <li> Used for 80 5 year olds in a school musical.  Parents made &amp;#34;ears&amp;#34; our of felt and attached to headbands.  They were a little big for some Kg students, but fit most.  None broke during rehearsal or performance!  That is a big deal!</li>
    <li> These are absolutely perfect for what I needed! I&#x27;m crafting Mickey ears for my son&#x27;s birthday party and hot glueing them to the head bands. They&#x27;re coming out great so far. The quality is just as you&#x27;d expect but they&#x27;re much more comfortable than I imagined they&#x27;d be! Glad I found these.</li>
    <li> I made many Mickey and Minnie ears for my 4 year-old&#x27;s birthday party using these headbands. It made them affordable party favors that the kids can keep....and maybe use for Halloween or pretend play. They were perfect. I did hot glue a little piece of felt on the inside at the bottom for cushion when wearing. I would not prefer to wear these myself as there are no teeth to the headbands and they are a little snug for an adult head in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These head bands take about a month to be shipped over from Hong Kong so order then accordingly. Other than that, it&#x27;s great price for the quantity you get. I ordered these to make party favor hello kitty headbands and everyone loved it! It&#x27;s perfect size for toddlers and small children. May be bit small for adults.</li>
    <li> GREAT product! I ordered these to make photobooth props for my sons birthday and they came out fantastic. These headbands are able to fit all sizes and are even gentle enough for children. I even used it one on my 1 year old. Glad I got so many in the deal so I can make things like this for the next party!</li>
    <li> Although the material is pretty durable for the price, two of the headbands came broken. The broken pieces were completely missing and the remaining piece was too small and too jagged for use.</li>
    <li> These are horrible, ugly and unusable. Looks like someone cut up a piece of plastic pipe to sell. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Nice, plain, plastic headbands. Perfect for making crafts.</li>
    <li> the edges of the hair bands are very sharp and could lead to  accidental cuts of a child tender hands or ears.</li>
    <li> I used these to create Mickey Mouse ears for my son&#x27;s first birthday (I hot glued black foam paper to the headbands). The plastic is sturdy and the &#x27;teeth&#x27; weren&#x27;t bothersome to the kids. Sometimes headbands bother kids behind their ears, but these ones stayed on the kids&#x27; heads all day. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t get here in time to add what we needed for our children&#x27;s musical (dock workers strike in Seattle), but they did! :) We are very pleased w/the quality of the headbands AND that they arrived on time.</li>
    <li> First time I bought these, they were great! Sturdy and thick.  The second time I ordered these... they were flimsy and didn&#x27;t hold up well. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I got these to make Mickey and Minnie ears for my son&#x27;s birthday. They will work great for that. I don&#x27;t know how well they would hold up for everyday use, but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
    <li> Great for projects! Works well w/felt &amp; hot glue! Easy to work with &amp; good number given! I&#x27;d recommen to everyone!</li>
    <li> Used them to make mickey and minnie ears. They were perfect. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These came rather quickly. They are just what I wanted for my crafting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase because the product is exactly what I expected, black, plastic band, good for wrapping with ribbon. These are 1/2 inch width with a little girth. It doesn&#x27;t have teeth.</li>
    <li> I used these and black felt to make a bunch of sets of mickey mouse ears for my daughter&#x27;s bday party, and they fit the kids, and myself, pretty darn comfortably. I was kinda suprised because they are just plastic, but they were more comfortable then the few premade store bought ears I had. I&#x27;ll be ordering more for next year&#x27;s party to make fox ear sets!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I did not receive all 36 headbands. I only received 24.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for, arrived in the time state.</li>
    <li> Affordable, just what I was looking for. Needed them for party favors, and the price was right. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> great product and quick delivery.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected and worked perfectly to make Poke&#x60;mon ears for my son&#x27;s birthday party! Thank you. Would love to work with you again should the need ever arise.</li>
    <li> Came in faster than I thought came unbroken</li>
    <li> These headbands don&#x27;t look as good in person as the do in the picture.... They are more of a gray color and some have splotches of different grays on them... They are passable because they fit fine, were really cheap, and I cover them in ribbon, but I was hoping for something that looked more polished and black like the picture.</li>
    <li> Just got them .. Look Great haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet tho</li>
    <li> I used these black plastic headbands to create Minnie Mouse ears for my nieces birthday party. They fit all sizes of heads. It fit my one-year-old son and my adult head. They were a huge hit at the party and not one broke. Kids were running all over the place and taking them in the jumper.Pretty durable!</li>
    <li> Perfect for making minnie and mickey mouse ears. Order early because they take about a month to receive.</li>
