<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like this set. The eye shadow looks great all day. The blush is transluscent so blends nicely with powder to get a nice polished look, especially for work.</li>
    <li> When I received my makeup kit I was disappointed because the entire bottom section  was broken and ruined. I was tempted to send the kit back but paying for the shipping is more than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> My niece 13 loved this.</li>
    <li> When my wonderful husband gave me this as a Christmas Gift it was so nice to find me a Hypoallergenic and Fragrance Free Beauty Kit.I love it and wear it all the time.I wish I had several kits....:)So hard to find Fragrance Free and Hypoallergenic Beauty Kits...</li>
    <li> A great makeup kit for beginner or someone just wanting to have a variety of makeup.  Also would be a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> My sister loved it! When I bought it it came on time i gave it to her as a Christmas present n she loves it and she uses it every day</li>
    <li> It came with 2 sections of make-up that had broken apart and the powder was spilled out and all over the product. Bought it for a gift and was unable to gift it, because of the missing make-up. Would be a nice little kit if all the make up was in tact.</li>
    <li> So cheap and crappy, low quality, and will not stay on...you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> this is a great kit for people who are begginers with makeup. There aren&#x27;t many brushes and the ones it comes with are rather small, but they work. The only problem I have is that it is smaller than I would have expected, but overall I like it.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected but overall okay for the price. The colors shown in the picture were pretty accurate. Overall build quality was poor but I expected that. It was a gift for a teenage girl and is good enough for that purpose. Would probably make a good travel set. Has everything you&#x27;d need for a quick carry-on makeup set.</li>
    <li> es excelente producto</li>
    <li> Really nice.  No problems with this, nice colors.</li>
    <li> Came in broken. Shipping package was in perfect shape. Makeup package was also packaged well with padding. The top of the compact (mirror part) was broken completely off at the hinges so no way to close it. Bought for my daughter for Christmas unsure how the makeup is yet.</li>
    <li> The case was badly broken when I took it out of its box.  It looked as if it may have been returned once, and then re-sold to me as &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34;.  The colors are nice, but considering I bought this to give as a gift to someone, it looks like I&#x27;ve just lost my money on this one.</li>
    <li> its smaller than i expected</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this as a makeup set, It comes in a very attractive black case that is durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMES WITH -&lt;br /&gt;blush, face powders, eye-shadows, lip-glosses, two lip brushes, one little face powder brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ~Good things about it~&lt;br /&gt;* The eye shadow colors are beautiful and come with different shades of one color in each row. For example :&lt;br /&gt;The blue row has a sky blue, baby blue, and than a slightly darker blue.&lt;br /&gt;*It has everything you possibly need&lt;br /&gt;* Its a decent size&lt;br /&gt;* You can travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;*shipping is fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ~Some Down sides~ ( there&#x27;s not to many downsides but there was only 2 or 3 that were a problem for me)&lt;br /&gt;* The bottom part, that contains the lip-glosses, blush, and face powders, sometimes does not open after a few uses. Once it broke on me and I was panicking but than I simply attached it back so it wasn&#x27;t that much of a problem, but its still sometimes is hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;*In the picture is shows the bottom piece slightly bigger than it really is, its pretty small the bottom piece.&lt;br /&gt;* The bottom slide feels cheap ( but the top slide doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product, I like it. I definitely think the price is great for this and is worth its $10. I recommend this to someone who wants a product that has a variety of makeup that is decent but also cheap. But I also think if you&#x27;re a usual makeup user this is not for you, I think its more for teenage girls or girls who are starting to learn.</li>
    <li> Purchased product for my wife and she is writing this review.  I used to buy brand name products with individual colors in its own &amp;#34;jar.&amp;#34; I felt like I had too much stuff to juggle, open, close and store when getting ready. I wanted to minimize and this product as an &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; was exactly what i was looking for. The color palette has all the colors I wear and I have reduced the number of items in my drawer. When I travel, I just pack up the entire case, and do not have to worry about bringing the wrong colors. I just need mascara.  I do use brushes that I have instead of the small ones that come with this package.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> cheap, color does not last. Would recommend as a starter kit for a young girl.</li>
    <li> I received this item today and was very disappointed to discover that the case was badly damaged.  There was a large crack in the lid, a broken hinge, mirror falling off the inside of the lid, and a one-inch section missing from the lid.  The case was wrapped inside the shipping box, but the broken piece was nowhere to be found.  The shipping box had no damage.  This item should never have made it past quality control in the manufacturing plant.  It&#x27;s really too bad, because the makeup seems nice.  I&#x27;m grateful for Amazon&#x27;s return policy.</li>
    <li> on top of arriving at last min on xmas eve, it was freakin broken and much much smaller than i expected</li>
    <li> I applaud Beautyezshop for listening to their reviewers and making things right. I had trouble with my first compact which they fixed. The makeup in this set is nice and the compact size makes it good for travel. It is a beauty revolution makeup kit. The lipglosses have pretty color as does the blush. The brush brush in the set picked up a lot of color. Glosses aren&#x27;t very moisturizing, but stay on well. Kind of like stains. Could try with chap stick. Foundation is light more like powder. The reason i wanted was for the shadows. They are pretty, light, but stay on well with primer.  The shadows, blush and one powder have glitter in them, but I have only noticed it in the white which works for highlighting. I am happy with the makeup and think the variety you get in a compact so portable is great.</li>
    <li> Its a nice elegant kit, easy to carry it in my handbag .beautiful and vibrant eye shades.nice shades off lip colour.</li>
    <li> the bottom tray of makeup was all broken up causing a giant mess when we opened it.  This was a stocking gift for my daughter to play with, not worth returning or making a fuss.</li>
    <li> loved it soo much.. most worthy item.. It has good colors of blushes and lipsticks.. Thank u for this Kit..</li>
    <li> A perfect makeup kit to gift someone. A handy tool to beautify yourself while travelling. A must one in your travel bag.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my granddaughter to experiment with applying makeup.  She is getting very good with a toned down look.</li>
    <li> Regardless of how much money I spent on this item, I was frustrated that it arrived damaged, and am not able to give this as a birthday gift along with the other things purchased to go into my gift bag.  Would not suggest purchasing from this seller. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved the makeover kit.  Looks very grown up and it matches with the Hello Kitty mirror as she experiments with the fine art of growing up a pretty girl.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and everyday I&#x27;m dying to use it even though I bought it for dance competitions!! Great product!!!! The eyeliner works well and the eyeshadow are well pigmented. The foundation covers up zits and under eye dark circles. The blush shows up well and lasts for a long time. The lip colors are good and are good alternatives other than lipsticks. The applicators are good but they are hard to take the color of the sponge. I would recommend buying other applicators or brushes like I did. Over all, this palette is amazing!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to take a chance to order this makeup kit though I did notice a reviewer said it arrived broken.  This was a Santa gift for my daughter and it did arrive broken up where the mirror attaches to the eyeshadow.  Needless to say I was very disappointed as was my 8 year old.  I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It was small than I expected,  especially the foundation and the lipsticks, but I enjoyed.</li>
    <li> This makeup was for my cousin, and she says she loves it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is something that you would give to your child who is now learning how to apply makeup....definitely not for someone who has been in the game for a while. I guess that is what happens when you try to be cheap.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girls and they love it!</li>
    <li> This was my first kit and has worked out great. Has foundation, eye pencil, eye shadow and blush. Makeup goes on very easy and seems to last. The bottom tray slides out so makes it more compact when not in use. Colors are very true to picture. For the price it can not be beat. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It looked good to me when i saw it online. but, when i received it, outer cover and even inside powder was broken.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.</li>
    <li> Most of the reviewers seemed to have bought this palette for young girls, but honestly, it&#x27;s suitable for anyone. There&#x27;s a nice assortment of eyeshadow colors, mostly shimmery but three nice matte neutral ones. The four blush shades ( tan, rose, hot pink, and a tawny red color) are all very pigmented and shimmery. There&#x27;s four shades of lipstick ( bubblegum pink, rosy mauve, wine red, and tawny red), a matte powder, and a shimmer powder. For anyone who loves makeup, this is a very good palette to consider.</li>
    <li> It is good.handy....very much satisfied.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to a future model in my neighborhood.  She seems to like it, but as a young girl, has not really said much to me about it.</li>
    <li> Great shipping time, packaged properly to prevent breakage.&lt;br /&gt;Very affordable, nice choices of colors. Everything you need in&lt;br /&gt;A very nice case. Want one for myself! Teenage granddaughter really likes it.</li>
    <li> I love the case and all of the eye shadows. It&#x27;s too bad I&#x27;ll never know what the blush was like. It arrived and when I opened it the blush was broken and spilled into the lip gloss! So I had to scrape out half of the lip gloss in order to use it. It was obviously not packaged well enough.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and they loved it thank you. it was for a young girl who is now into playing with makeup</li>
    <li> Lovely pastels and nice quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for my 14 year old daughter as a gift. Great &amp;#34;on-the-go&amp;#34; kit to use before her cheer performances!</li>
    <li> I once thought make up was the one item that should not be bought online, boy was I wrong- at least from this company. My make came intact nothing was broken or crumbled.  I was impressed with the wrapping. The company chose the larger bubble wrap as oposed to the smaller ones that add little if any protection from breakage. Other companies should follow suit and realize they would use less packaging material while providing be t ter protection. I will order my make up from this company and recommend to anyone to do the same. Theresa Williams</li>
    <li> I am using this on someone else.  It was not for personal use.  There are a lot of very nice colors and seem to apply easily. The dual-layer tray is great.</li>
    <li> I love this set! It comes in an attractive case with everything neatly organized and in one place!! The colors are amazing and having blush, eyeliner, and face powder is such a plus. I plan to buy several more for gifts!! Great price and GREAT product!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Everything was packaged and protected . However , I am returning said product because the makeup is Glittery not Matte. I included pictures where you can see the sparkle tint in the eyeshadow , blush, and lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;I know glitter helps reflect light and brightens the colors, but I like matte looks better.&lt;br /&gt;Also the foundation was a shade darker than in the photos, and the eyeliner was a hard pencil. I had to press hard and go back and forth to apply a thin line of eyeliner . It seems I would need to heat the tip to get a more pigmented response</li>
    <li> great all in one design, this compact really wowed the girls; slim design and good colors! very easy to open and easy to carry</li>

    <li> My granddaughter loves it but she is young.  It wasn&#x27;t as big as I thought it would be but it was very nice for the price.</li>
