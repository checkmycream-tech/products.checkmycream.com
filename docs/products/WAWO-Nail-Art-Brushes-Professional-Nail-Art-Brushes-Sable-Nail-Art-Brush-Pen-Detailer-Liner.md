<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After use it would not work. Def not worth my money</li>
    <li> crapy crapy crapy and crapy. you get what you pay for i guess</li>
    <li> The tips of the brushes are all over the place that from even the very first use, I couldn&#x27;t get them to straighten out for a proper design line.  You&#x27;re better off spending a few extra dollars to get a better quality at the store.  I used them about 3 x&#x27;s since I bought them over a year ago.  Too annoying to use.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> My brushes arrived today and I am very disappointed with the. First of all they look nothing like the picture and when I tried to take off the protective plastic they just came apart. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this brushes.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be better they are the material house painting brushes are made of they are quite hard</li>
    <li> Fell apart as soon as I took them out of the package! Metal tip comes right off.</li>
    <li> I like it not very cheap very precise</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> the picture shows one brand, and the actual product is different. looks like an immitation. Not happy.only numbers on the bruhes, no other writing.</li>
    <li> Super fine brushes are better than the toothpicks I was using before.  Glad I found these.  They really do the trick.</li>
    <li> best purches ever gives me very nice work and totally worth it!!! I would totally recommend it to whom will buy it</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, but only 4 stars because I expected them to be just a tiny bit smaller and thinner.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet. When i first received them i took the plastic case off the bursh and the top of the brush came completely off. I was able to just stick it right back on, I may super glue it later. I think they are cheaply made but they don&#x27;t look  cheap.  For $1 these are good brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes good weight to brushes and hairs are made right for brushes I would rebuy if I had too lol wonderful 5 stars in my book.</li>
    <li> i bought these so i can practice making nail art. i haven&#x27;t used them yet, but i can&#x27;t imagine anything going wrong.&lt;br /&gt;they were a good price and came before i thought they would.</li>
    <li> First off I wanted to say they came super fast..... And jus the brush in general is perfect ....I use it for my eyeliner and of course my nails and it lets u do beautiful designs...it&#x27;s a must have item.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t  used this products but I think I&#x27;m going to get the best of it  is very nice I like it</li>
    <li> Awesome product &amp; it came earlier than expected ! ,y other products got lost except this one so it was really great inhad no problems at all &amp; the brushes are awesome</li>
    <li> I bought these nail brushes for cheep figuring, how awful could they really be. Right? But I was wrong. I used nail polish remover because I messed up on one of my nails and I wasn&#x27;t expecting the black stuff from the paint brush to come off and stick to my hand as if the handle was painted using nail polish. SAVE YOUR TIME and EFFORT. DON&#x27;T ORDER THIS.</li>
    <li> I have had so much with theses brushes, I can do so much more with my nail art I am very happy with them!</li>
    <li> the price was good, product was good nd was sent out fast. I use these for different nail art designs on my nails.</li>
    <li> It falls apart after just 1 use.</li>
    <li> I got these and they work okay, but the tip of one of the brushes broke off as soon as I tired to use it. If you&#x27;re starting out with nailart they are okay.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes was broken.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Wifes business and they were a hit.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good for creative designs on your nails, but it is difficult to get the same amount of varnish and the same results on different nails. Use them for motifs that vary and not for very regular ones, as it is difficult to control the final result.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes for nail art designs. Easy to use and control for tiny patterns. Would recommend for any type of art work.</li>
    <li> I recently bought these brushes for $1.15, I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy or in cute cases. Just something quality and simple. I&#x27;m incredibly happy with these brushes and have no complaints at all. I have done a flower and a polka dot pattern so far. I&#x27;ve only used the shortest, it provided great details and was easy to control. I am looking forward to trying more patterns as the summer gets closer. Mine arrived in perfect condition in a plastic bag with small plastic caps. This was a great (and inexpensive) investment for my nail kit! I don&#x27;t see any reason I&#x27;d need any other brushes besides these 3.</li>
    <li> Item received is not the same as the item pictured they are just black brushes with number size on them for example &#x27;0&#x27; or &#x27;000&#x27; nothing fancy and the bristles do not make a fine line. I can&#x27;t be too disappointed though because the item was very cheap and often times the saying is true &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27;</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this purchase but when I started using the brushes I wasn&#x27;t so happy. The larger brush is difficult to use. It doesn&#x27;t hold color very well to do big designs. The medium brush and the small brush work a little better. I am no professional nail artist but I thought getting these brushes would help me practice and learn. So far they&#x27;ve been a bit of a headache.</li>
    <li> On first view the product is okay,  But upon first use, the metal ends with the brushes came off the wood after one use...Not good. Luckily I had another brand with me to use, which is working out quite well.</li>
    <li> these are really nice and very inexpensive small tip brushes for doing detailed model painting. they work well with oil or water based acrylic paints. pretty hardy for something so inexpensive!</li>
    <li> This item was delivered very quickly ! Its a great product to design nails with. (example - leopard print ) I HIGHLY recommend this seller/product to anyone for future purchases ! What you see is what you get !</li>
    <li> The brushes r thicker than in the picture</li>
    <li> Well when I got them I shaping the brush with my fingers the top came of but it whent back on other than that thier great</li>
    <li> Broke first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to arrive and smells bad when it does. Brushes are poor quality and falls apart.</li>
    <li> Delivered super fast! Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> The tips of all 3 brushes where the metal and wood Meet were bent and snapped off upon arrival</li>
    <li> I purchased that brushes for detailed lines in nail art.  The bristles are somewhat soft, so delicate lines are difficult to achieve.  They are okay for wider lines.  They cleaned up well.  Once you know the limitations to the brushes, they are a great purchase for $1.50.</li>
    <li> i bought these for painting on cookies. could NOT beat the price! shipped fast too</li>
    <li> The glue holding the metal part on fell apart pretty quick but for the price they&#x27;re a nice little starter set</li>
    <li> I love them, I didn&#x27;t get them for my nails but to paint on fabric. I will be ordering again. I&#x27;ll definitely try them on my nails though.</li>
    <li> I like them. I have had these for a little over a year. I use them on a regular basis. However, one of them came apart, and on another the hairs started to fall out. They were not super expensive. I just wish they lasted a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes love them!!!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed. It arrived early. But two of the brushes were broke, and then third one broke as soon i picked it up. I was very upset</li>
    <li> Great price and great quality</li>
    <li> great price and quality</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t absorb polish. Waited 1 month for nothing!</li>
    <li> It was an absolutely horrible product. There was no form to the brushes, the bristles were to soft to do anything except smudge nail polish everywhere. Fell apart the first day I got them. I am cheap, but not that cheap. Would highly recommend not buying this product.</li>
    <li> These are okay. Good price though.</li>
    <li> These seem like really good, high quality brushes for a very low price. I bought them for painting fine lines and detail on crafts, rather than for my nails, but I think they will work as well or even better than regular paint brushes, especially since the bristles are short</li>
    <li> I was happy to see that my package arrived much before eta but when I looked at the package it was horribly destroyed as was the brushes. Every single one of them was broken where the metal meets the wood. I contacted the seller and they were more than sorry. They refunded my money and were very kind. I knew I wouldn&#x27;t really be happy with such long brush sticks to do fine detail so I made my own make shift version out of the broken metal part. Works well now.</li>
    <li> I use this for my nails and it&#x27;s great! The precision is awesome!</li>
    <li> Really pleased with these brushes good quality !!</li>
    <li> 2 of the 3 brushes were broken when I received them. They are useless now, but would cost more for shipping them back than the brushes cost</li>
    <li> these are easy to use tools to add stripes or draw designs. fast shipping. would definitely buy from again Thanks!</li>
    <li> I just got this pack of nail stripers and I got mini rhinestones pack but when I opened the package I had a dollar it was in their just sitting there it was funny but I got a dollar and the stripers work really well if you r thinking about getting some u total should and they r not that much</li>
    <li> Love them. Exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love my nail art brush. I am now able to design of my own and not have to pay some else&#x27;s to do them</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the fine points and the price! 😍 one came apart, but was easily fixable.</li>
    <li> I like trying to use these nail brushes, but the &#x27;fur&#x27; of it falls out pretty easy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE BRUSHES.....THE ART WORK ON MY NAILS ARE NICE.....THE ZEBRA POINTS I DO ARE EASY WITH THE BRUSHES...I WILL GET MORE WHEN POSSIBLE.</li>
    <li> These brushes work great, I like to paint, so I got one set to do detailed work on my painting crafts and the other set for my nails. Although I am taking away a star because when I clean the brushes that I use for my nails, the metal tip that holds the bristles on the wood comes off.</li>
    <li> good except one of the tips fell off. but other than that it was gr8. i really like them a lot!</li>
    <li> I got this for using for fine point eyeliner. The smelled when I got them, but the smell went away after sung them. They work great for precision eyeliner</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes so i could do designs on my nails with the colors i already own instead of buying the bottles that come with the thin brushes. They arrived very quickly but when i tried them they were horibble! They make very think streaky lines. Really disappointed! You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Regular paint brushes !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay it looks different in the picture and the brushes are big but it&#x27;s very good quality and very helpful I recommend buying this :)</li>
    <li> I USE THESE FOR MANY THINGS  NAILS, EYELINER&#x27;S , LIPS, AND EVEN ON SMALL ITEMS I WANT TO DRAW FACES AND THEY ARE REALLY GOOD FOR EYES ON CERAMICS</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes in hopes of them making fine nail art designs with my regular polishes but these brushes are not good (Too short and too soft) for that if thats what your looking for they might help you paint in a design but not for \\&quot;nail art\\&quot; They are good for something but not what I specifically intended them for Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I know they were cheap and all the way from China, but other items came quicker than 2 months and these broke apart taking them out of the package.  The metal part came off the wooden handle and you could see the bit of glue they used to attach them.</li>
    <li> They work great with not just nail polish but with fine lines in paintings, as a gel eyeliner liner pencil and other make up things. I love them and use them, everyday. Ive already recommended this to other people.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and got exactly what I paid for. Acetone does not mesh w glue used to hold bristles will try regular nail polish remover for other brushes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product if you are looking for high quality brushes. I got mine in the mail the tips were all bent and the brush heads were sticking out everywhere. I want to upload a photo but I cant find where to do so, so take my word. Just do not buy. They are no good for nail art. Too messed up for anything. Also they didn&#x27;t exacty look the same as they did in the picture. I hope this helps anyone. I would recommend looking for brushes with higher reviews or go to  a store and buy them in person so you know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> Love these and it&#x27;s so cheap!! It&#x27;s perfect for nail art :) I would definitely recommend this set of brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought these when they were $1.00 shipped.  When I received them, one of the brush handles was chipped, up near the top where the metal clamps on.  The brush was crooked, I had to gently try and press it back into shape, hoping I didn&#x27;t snap the chipped part of the brush handle off.  It&#x27;s very flimsy due to missing part of the handle and I don&#x27;t think it will last long.  The other two brushes were fine, but there&#x27;s obviously no quality control or something like that wouldn&#x27;t have made it out the door.  Made in China, what can I say....</li>
    <li> I bought these and I cut the package open with scissors and I happened to cut the tips of every single brush right off.  I am a bit disappointed that the packaging didn&#x27;t warn you which end the tops were at / there wasn&#x27;t a plastic cover to prevent this from happening.  Now I will have to buy again if I want to try these out.</li>
    <li> These work well for nail designs as  well for crafts too would buy again</li>
    <li> My daughter bought these to do some patterns and things on her fingernails. She has never used something like this before, but with the help of some videos on Youtube, she was able to do some pretty interesting things.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and are very professional very good brushes make beautiful lines and easy to wash and work smoothly! very good product! i&#x27;d definitley recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use these brushes in my fine art for the smallest details, perfect tools!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes.  I don&#x27;t do a lot of painting so have not used often, but so far they have held up well.  I take care not to dip the brushes too deep in to acetone to clean.</li>
    <li> One star- for seller sending me the product.&lt;br /&gt;Zero star- for the product. The brushes were so bad that I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it except to throw them out. Yes, I understand you get what you pay for, but come on!!! The brush heads came as separate parts from their handle, so I glued them on with superglue. This only lasted for so long before the acetone would break it down and the heads fall apart again. Then, the bristles, oh the bristles...I don&#x27;t know what cheap materials they used but the acetone destroyed/burned it so it frizzled/frayed out. Nail polish would clumped up so couldn&#x27;t do any designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: the liquid eyeliner brushes are excellent for nail designs. I cleaned them with acetone and wah-la...now I have my own set of nail art brushes!</li>
    <li> I purchased these when I was trying to build my own acrylic nail set. When I first used them, the bristles immediately began to fray. When I rinsed the brush with nail polish remover the paint on the brush handle began to come off. For what I paid for these brushes I really can&#x27;t complain. They work well enough to do small decorations, and that&#x27;s exactly what I expected to use them for. I am more careful about how I dry and rinse the bristles when changing polish colors. Compared to sets that are sold at the nearby Target, these are an excellent value for an amature. If you&#x27;re more serious about nail design, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these. Note: I am only an amautre, so perhaps some of the discrepancies with this product are my fault, and not that of the product.</li>
    <li> Delivery was great. But the picture shows the brushes trimmed and look great for detailing. But the brushes were chunky and i had to trim them alot. After my trimming was complete they were a great tool for my collection.</li>
    <li> These are so cheap, yet really well made, they can work for nail art or even makeup application. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I use these to do detail work on nails. The work beautifully and are easy to clean, whether I&#x27;m using acrylic or enamel. Not bad for a buck.</li>
    <li> I used them to make designs on my nails and they are great...made well...well worth it!  would recommend these brushes to anyone who likes to decorate their nails.......F.M.</li>
    <li> CHEAP and useless. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> one of the brushes metalic material came off, I can easily glue them back on. The quality is I paid for the product. Still It ended up being a good pruchase.</li>
    <li> the silver thing kept falling off, the brushes dont completey get rid of the nail polish even tho u clean it with nail polish removal. not a good product</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected them to be, it as thin as in the pictures</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used one brush, but as soon as I opened it the silver top came off and had to be glued back on.</li>
    <li> i ordered brushes based on their function and when i seen them in the mail and they were what i ordered, i was satisfied</li>
    <li> just got these and used them! I love them! great brushes very! very! please. would buy again.! A++! worked greattt great seller!</li>
    <li> Very cheap the way its put together. All three brushes fell apart the 1st day i recieved them. Would not recommened</li>
    <li> They are ok. Enough to get the job done. Perfect for beginners.</li>
    <li> still waiting for them</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really work with nail polish. Even though it was really cheap and shipping took 2 weeks, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought these nail art brushes, excited to finally use certain colors on my nails - but of course, right when the brushes arrived, I had to use them. When I started painting, the whole metal piece came off! I was so disappointed because It wouldn&#x27;t go back on. And even before it fell of, the lines didn&#x27;t show up. I am not happy with this product and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> 2 out of 3 brushes arrive broken. The ferrules were detached from the handles. The glue used to hold them together was pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> i chose this product because i like nail detailing and and i love the quality of these brushes and where i ordered trhem when when i had a question about my order and i contacted seller i got great results and quick friendly results and i will be ordering from them agan!!!</li>
    <li> brush easily comes off of wooden handle which makes it hard to use - but it does do the job.</li>
    <li> I got what I wanted and I can&#x27;t wait to use them, im just getting n 2 nail art designing</li>
    <li> I love these I use them for eyeliner</li>
    <li> Got this nail art brush, who doesnt like they&#x27;re nail to be pretty so I tried to do some art with this brushes but it&#x27;s hard to control if your hands are kinda shaking haha.. But over all like it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> The product was ca,e in good time ad was exactly what the description said it was, the only issues was that all 3 brushes were dented and the package looked like it had been stepped on- there was a footprint on the package as well.</li>
    <li> I use these to create nail art on my own nails (and sometimes my 6 year olds).  They work nicely.  They arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Broke quickly, very cheap.</li>
    <li> Useful but then the metal thats attatched to the handle kept coming off.. Quite annoying while doing designs but a bit of glue wouldnt hurt. Other than that issue, it was alright. Doesnt go well with polish but its ok with acrylic paints for nails.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, I was happy with it. But the brushes are not easy to use, I guess probably they are too short.</li>
    <li> Comes apart each time you use and if you use nail polish remover the black paint comes off and makes your fingers black and sticky</li>
    <li> product got here on time it was damage, how ever it was replace immediately. I am happy with this product I recommend it to people. for just a dollar it was worth it.</li>
    <li> This product was pretty disappointing. They took weeks to arrive, and when they did I was not pleased. The brushes are not what i expected; they are much too soft and do not make good lines at all. Glad they weren&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
    <li> I loved how this one of the brushes came already broken!!! I also was amazed that when I tried to clean nail polish out of the brush the brush paint came of as well. I mean I do understand that nail polish remover purpose is to remove paint and stuff, but, come on guys this is the NAIL ART brush! It should not be affected by nail art products. Also the quality of brush hairs is amazingly low. It&#x27;s perfect for creating &amp;#34;It&#x27;s my first time using nail polish look&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have multiple polishes that are designed for nail art with thin brushes that I&#x27;ve bought at various dollar stores, those brushes prove to be more precise and defined than these brushes.  Color me disappointed. But, ya get what ya pay for, so I really can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
    <li> Items arrived very fast. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain for how cheap they are but the handles of the brushes are crooked and not straight and the ferrule fell right off the wooden handle as soon as I opened them. The bristles themselves seem to be in ok shape but I will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes because they clean up well and they are the size of a pen, so it is easy to freehand paint with them. I believe that they are made of sable because they clean up well unlike a set of synthetic hair brushes I had and since threw out. I highly recommend these brushes to anyone from novice to pro.</li>
    <li> The bristles don&#x27;t hold together well. They are overall cheesy. My thought for these were the usually are 13$ they should be of somewhat good quality. A nd if they aren&#x27;t, I&#x27;m only losing 94¢. 94¢ lost. maybe ok for painting. But not nail art.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very useful in spreading nail art! Not very coarse and doesn&#x27;t slack with frequent use. Great to have around!</li>
    <li> Perfect! The design possibilities are endless! They are very sturdy and clean well too! Perfect for at home nail art and for kids!</li>
    <li> it was delivered fast but are cheaply made,for the price its not that bad one  of them came apart as so as i opened it a little super glue fixed it.they are stiff brushes and just as long as regular paint brushes</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brushes! I ordered a set for my grand daughter! The order does take several weeks to arrive, but definitely worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I am tempted to get more for doll face painting, however my larger brush did come to me with the bristles screwed up in manufacturing. I didn&#x27;t see the point to return considering the price.</li>
    <li> They smelled horrible!!! Like paint thinner.</li>
    <li> I used these in nail polish and then trying to remove it with nail polish remover the brush came off</li>
    <li> My nails have never looked beter my daughter does my nails and i hers so we are fit for the holidays</li>
    <li> Great deal  and grate brushes . They seem like the would a long time . Grate size for easy use&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what these things are supposed to be used for, but I can&#x27;t use them for anything. It was a total waist of my money.</li>
    <li> do like them they are cheap and the metal part of this came of the wood stick and to do design is hard</li>
    <li> These are very sturdy brushes. Not anything like I expected for the amazing price. I will be ordering a larger set of brushes soon</li>
    <li> I am doing my own nails now to save some money and these art brushes are salon quality. 3 brushes, 3 sizes. They are an inexpensive addition to my nail art polish as the nail art polish brushes are thicker and tend to make lines too thick for the intricate designs of flowers and line art.</li>
    <li> these sucked! they were broke when the got here and the brushes barley even painted ... I am very disappointed I suggest you put some strong ass glue on here next time</li>
    <li> I love this item because I&#x27;m pretty creative.  I recommend it only if you like nail art and have the patience.</li>
    <li> Love the fine line brushes. I can now craft with precision. Would recommend these to all shoppers in need of fine line tools.</li>
    <li> The product says nail brushes that I would think would be for stripping and other designs but they seem like paint brushes because they are thick and bulky. If you&#x27;re looking for a striping or detail brush I do not recommend these.</li>
    <li> Very Useful, definitely recommend, awesome items. Just ask the contruction of it get more attention. My tips keep falling of their post.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected but it works for what I paid. I as well got some for the sisters</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It came on time and it was even better than I thought. It woks great and very easy to was so you can reuse them. They let you make all those little designs you have been dreaming of doing!</li>
    <li> when I received them in the mail the tips of the brush was broken, I super glued it back together but its not very strong.  I hope they package this different for future buyers</li>
    <li> This product is a handy size and it works well. However, the heads of the brushes fall off and sometimes they are extremely hard to find because they are small. If you are looking for cheap design brushes, these are perfect. If you are looking for high quality brushes then don&#x27;t buy these nail art brushes.</li>
    <li> Cheap... They all broke</li>
    <li> They are perfect for drawing you art on your nails, I love them.</li>
    <li> IIt looked like a good product at first but when it arrived I noticed that the bristles were a little bent. The shipping did take a while but it did arrive on time.I was overall satisfied with the product as it did get the job done and works fine. It is worth the buy for the price</li>
    <li> perfect for putting on the clear glitter and making little designs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool, arrived earlier...</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5 stars, but on the first time I used it, the metal part holding the brush fell off the wooden handle. it was nothing a little glue couldn&#x27;t fix though, and it&#x27;s been an amazing product since.</li>
    <li> They are too soft to use for a design, I bought these and just ended up making my own striper from an old nail polish brush.</li>
    <li> they broke when i took them out the package..but when i glued them back together they was ok brushes..you get whaat you pay for</li>
    <li> Basically, you get what you pay for....this product was listed for one dollar, It did detail extended shipping time in the product description but it was almost a month between order and product arrival. The brush tips (silver area) had been bent on all three and came off of wooden handle easily. I affixed the broken tips back on handle with super glue but then upon first use, the brush fibers DISSOLVED in the acetone while cleaning. worthless</li>
    <li> Usually when I put faith into a cheap product, I&#x27;m left with a good result, but the bristles fall out quite easily on these brushes. I will still use them until they are done for, though.</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes yesterday and I am very happy with them.  They are everything that was described in the description given by the seller. So I am happy with these!</li>
    <li> I love them. The only thing is that it took so long just for 3 brushed. But they are useful.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes best ones I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> now I can do any design I want that I have the correct tools.  no more paying for designs on nails.</li>
    <li> bristles kinda flimsy but great to use for the price it was posted for.. worth the money but shipping was a month later as opposed to usually 2,3 weeks</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect for what I need them for! I mainly use them for super fine detail work on my nails and I like that they are still enough to stay together and not create very small, wispy lines where I do not want them.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are easy to clean, even with glitter dried on them.&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any fallout from the bristles and the design of the brush allows the head to stay attached. The head itself feels very secure.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used 1 of the brushes for eyeliner and it worked great for that purpose, so I actually use it only for eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Detailer, striper, oh my! Use these brushes with acrylic paint if drawing designs. (if u mess up you can wash acrylic off with warm water and nail polish base wont come off!). The brushes have this plastic over them so it wont bend during shipping as well :). Recommended for people who like to hand draw their nail art or would like to practice!</li>
    <li> Open the box, then open the trash can, through it in.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I can say when I received this crap</li>
    <li> They dont work as well as I thought they would Loved tge price tho!!! Thats why I gave it 3stars</li>
    <li> I bought these for purposes other than decorating fingernails, so I don&#x27;t know how they would work for nail art. I often need teensy tiny brushes that I do use under a magnifier. These were a great price, so I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I am pleased with the product. It is as described, of nice quality, and it arrived within the stated time-frame.</li>
    <li> They were good but cheaply made the silver part came off the black part before I even used the thing</li>
    <li> These brushes work great for detailing designs.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Everything seems to be in order.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m surprised by how many people gave this 5 stars. I paid a cheap price so I was already expecting something not so great, so keep that in mind. They take a while to ship, which isn&#x27;t really a big deal. But they feel apart on me and the brushes didn&#x27;t work that well. The bristles were different lengths on the same brush which made them hard to work with. Anyways, I know the price looks great but if you want good brushes just don&#x27;t get these.</li>
    <li> they are exactly what i was aiming to get...i am enjoying the product as i thought that i would and hope to get more stuff this quick</li>
    <li> Fell apart before I even took it out of the plastic pouch. The brush itself is useless. I couldn&#x27;t do any designs with it because what ever the bristles are made of are cheap! waste of money</li>
    <li> Love these brushes for fine detail nail art! I use these in my at home nail salon. Will purchase more.</li>
    <li> I was expecting these brushes a few weeks ago and i saw they were cheap and i knew but i did NOT think that when they got here it would look so bad. Every single brush is broken in some way, the paint is almost completely chipped off of one brush, t took a long time, it looks and feels as if someone had glued or geled the bristles an the tips together, it also smells like mellting or burning plastic , everything is bent, and its just horrid i cant come within a few inches of it let alone put it on my nails. . I honestly DO NOT recommend this, the packaging is super small especially for 5-6 inch brushes. The package doesnt look like it can even fit a phone case for a galaxy. Its absurd how bad this product came out. I guess it what you get for a cheap thing.</li>
    <li> The kids love these, priced okay for the fun they are having for sure...  seem good quality so far, 9 and 11 yr old</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re into nail art it&#x27;s a must have. I bought them and use them all the time for my nails, they are what I expected. Nothing more or less.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality and the shipping/delivery process. This might be one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> I bought this cuz the brush part is pointy and I will use as a make up brush not a nail brush...</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 sets me this item. One set was really nice but now the 2nd set, not so much. The size of the brushes were different than the first set. I wanted to send it back but I decided not to.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but are what I ordered. I hope to use them soon to do some Halloween art on my nails.</li>
    <li> Great little brushes that let you make neat designs on your nails.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect for all those fancy drawings.</li>
    <li> When my items arrived the tips were broken and i had to glue then together terrible experience</li>
    <li> they are nice brushes but mine fell apart after about a week of use... nothing some superglue couldnt fix but shouldnt have to fix it that soon</li>
    <li> The first day I got it the brush broke off and if you are looking for dotting tools I won&#x27;t suggest this very disappointed ...</li>
    <li> Arrived early BUT, these brushes SUCK! Can&#x27;t even make a simple line with this crap. Very disappointed with this purchase, definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> Ordered one set for a friend and the wait is long since it&#x27;s shipping from out of the country.  No problems with that order but my 2nd order finally arrived after 3 weeks and that set had 2 broken unusable brushes. However I have learned using paint brushes from Walmart are just as good if not better, plus not having to wait helps too.</li>
    <li> I love these nail brushes for adding simple designs. The brushes are great quality for the price, but I wish there was more in the pack as far as thickness goes.</li>
    <li> When I got these brushes I went to use them and the brushes snapped off of the wood part. Then I tried to make use of the brushes and then I saw that on the inside of the brush there was mold</li>
    <li> These brushes work well but they&#x27;re longer than I thought they would be.  They are really helpful for nail art.</li>
    <li> The brushes were not soft enough and wouldn&#x27;t write accurately the designs that I wanted. I was unstatisified. The price is perfect for these brushes.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a long time, but it was worth it. The actual brush has a very strong spray-paint smell that gets on your hands and such. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes for this price. In my experience, no bristles have fallen out into my polish or while I was painting. However, when I went to clean these with a little acetone, I accidentally rubbed the wooden lacquered handle, and the black paint got clumpy and rubbed off all over everywhere. Be careful! Otherwise, these are a fun tool to have for nail art.</li>
    <li> These things fell apart much too easily. The metal detaches from the wood making the brushes hard to use. Some of the brushes came unglued after two or three uses.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, but 2 of my brushes have come off the black handle parts. Thank goodness for crazy glue! They still do the job and should last you a long time if you take good care of them.</li>
    <li> These are not as sturdy as I hoped but they get job done.</li>
    <li> Well I just got these today and I was excited to open them and start using them but these bristles must be too thick or something because when I use them they are NOT like nail art brushes!!! More like the small actual paint brushes for a moral instead. So if you have small nails you won&#x27;t be happy with this item. But my nails are rather long and yet it&#x27;s still sooo thick. Eh, ok product if you can find another use for them.</li>
    <li> These brushes just break apart and are cheaply made like they were hot glued together a little pressure on it and they fall apart</li>
    <li> i havent yet tried them because i&#x27;m still collecting nail polish but they look just like the picture and they got here sooner than i expected. I hope my purchase is well worth it! so far i love them</li>
    <li> I paid just a little over a dollar for this product so far it&#x27;s working out great. I use this brush for nail art and I find it really easy to draw beautiful filigree. I can only use the brushes with acrylic paint. Never polish! I only seem to ruin my brushes that way. I can never get them totally clean with acetone. Hate that. There was one little mishap where I spilled a little bit of nail polish remover and my brush got wet. The pretty, slick black façade left sticky black smudges all over my hands and where it had lain on my table. Though with acetone the smudges came off easy enough. These brushes are also very comfortable to hold for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wary because the brushes were so cheap. But I&#x27;m definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works Great, The Only Problem About It Was One Of Them Broke But Nothing A Little Super Glue Couldn&#x27;t Fix.</li>
    <li> I waited forever to purchase these and I&#x27;m so glad that I finally did! They work awesome for creating cute nail designs!</li>
    <li> These are ok. They can&#x27;t hold too much nail polish but I shoulve known to opt for brushes with longer hairs. Its not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> These are three of my absolute favorite nail art brushes. They are small and able to provide excellent detail when painting designs. Always be sure to remove all polish and wash and rinse properly after each use. I have given these brushes quite a workout, and they still stand the test of time and have not shed or frayed in any way.</li>
    <li> I am new at this not even licensed but love doing nails i experiment with my nail all the time so happy i got this product for my nails and always have a perfect lines .</li>
    <li> So precise and neat&lt;br /&gt;I used these for eye makeup</li>
    <li> When I got my package &amp; went to use my brushes the Brissles was all messed up and fanned out before I even took them out the pack. When I tried to use them to see if maybe it will go back to normal after it just made a big mess.</li>
    <li> the brush tip were alot bigger than in the image and the metal tip glued on the brush was already wobbly when it arrived in the mail and popped right off on 2 of the 3 brushes that came..</li>
    <li> It shipped super quickly! It was exactly what I was looking for and it was also an unbeatable price. I love all that I can do with these three different sized brushes.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet for my nails, but I tested them out and they seem of good quality. The 00 brush had one or two hairs that were a little too long, so I cut them back a little bit. I don&#x27;t think that made a difference in the brush thickness, or at least I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these in sets for the girls in our family. My grandaughter is studying cosmetolgy so a few extra for her for later use.</li>
    <li> great! i made so many really cute nail designs with it!! a must have for any nail art fan definitely!</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect for the small lines that a nail stripe just can&#x27;t do! They are so small and good quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m overall pleased with the actual product,  the brushes are perfect and neat, none were broken and a good product for $1. I was just not happy with the shipment of the product. I ordered them back in july and the estimated delivery date was Aug 7, 2013 - Aug 24, 2013. I received them AFTER the entire estimated delivery date. I read other reviews so from there, I thought I would receive them on time. Other than that I&#x27;m okay with my purchase</li>
    <li> Such a horrid smell was coming off these that I disposed of them.</li>
    <li> They were nice for about 2 weeks. Then started to fray and not come to points. I use them for, well nothing now.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of this product. Works well and makes fine finishes on a manicure a breeze. Would buy again if needed!</li>
    <li> These brushes are not bad quality to begin with, as well as still being used in my regular nail art routine nearly a year after purchase. They do fray if you don&#x27;t take care of them, but that happens with any brush. I ruined one by leaving it out and it was pressed against something that ruined the fine point of the brush. Not a defect in any way, it was my own negligence. These are great for the price.</li>
    <li> I love these super thin brushes! They are very cheap for a good quality, I definitely recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 packs of nail art brushes and these are my fave! The brushes are a little more stiff which I wanted for freehand drawing</li>
    <li> This product was pretty dirt cheap so I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much but the bristles are much too thick to do any intricate designs. I woudn&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! Cheap!</li>
    <li> Nice and strong brushes, I did not try it still, but from the packet look good. We will see later.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes I bought broke as soon as I got it. Also they are very poor quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Im one step up from hating product and its sad because I waited a long time to recieve this product.  When I first arrived I was so happy and could not wait to use it. Will I used it later on the night and boy was that a headache. First as I began to use it I notice the bushes were sticky so I go to wash them off and black im guessing spray paint came off turning the entire brand new black brush WHITE.  I ignored it and continued on... big mistake Because the hairs kept separating so my fine line detailing would turn into a half decent line with a sketching shawdow behind it. Never again will I use this product. But im not to mad because the price I paid wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> just as expected &amp; just as described</li>
    <li> LOVE these nail art brushes!!!</li>
    <li> The ever impressive Sugarbelle uses these and of course I had to have them. The work wonders for those thin lines on cookies like eye lashes and whatnot. Plus for the price ... how could you past them up?</li>
    <li> I love this product. They work just as if I went to a nail salon and bought brand new professional brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very useful and I recommend them. The only thing that is wrong with the set that I got is that some of the brisles are way longer than the others. But I fixed it with some scissors. They are worth the money.</li>
    <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, and I certainly didn&#x27;t get it. Brushes are very stiff, and when trying to clean one the metal top came right off the handle. I probably could&#x27;ve gorilla glued it back on but since I have more I opted to just toss that particular brush. Haven&#x27;t touched the other two since. Considering the price I&#x27;m not really disappointed, but I would not purchase again. They did however arrive very quickly, within about a week or so.</li>
    <li> For .98 cents you really cannot complain. I have tried one of the brushes and it works fairly well for how much I spent</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes, easy to control and make beautiful designs on nails. Fantastic price. I love these brushes and recommend them to anyone wanting to do designs on your nails. These work from simple stripes to complicated patterns and pictures.</li>
    <li> These r the worst brushes I ever got they r so do stiff u can&#x27;t even do what u want to do on your nail the brush came off the handle and the paint did too buy cheap get cheap don&#x27;t buy these at all buyers beware</li>
    <li> My tween daughter used some of her birthday money to purchase these - she loves them and has fun painting detailed designs on her nails with these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for awhile now and they do work.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the silver cap came off of one of the brushes, but I applied some glue and stuck it back on.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and now everytime I paint my nails I used them. No more bobbipins to make polka dots anymore!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these brushes. Very good quality and great price. Shipping was rather fast also. I was not disappointed. Have used these many times and will def be buying them again when the time comes. :)</li>
    <li> When I first order this brushes I really not imagine the they whore so nice quality,nice I recomend this product&lt;br /&gt;With out getting pay for it just trust&lt;br /&gt;Cool saler</li>
    <li> i used it to paint stripes on my nails, raelly works well, its brushes, theres not much to say but they work well, they are good quality.</li>
    <li> I am happy to say these made it fairly fast for being international.  A great thin brush for fine details.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner with hand painted nail art and I really like using these with my acrylic paints.  I just wish the brushes were a little more fine. The amount of hairs/bristles is on the thick side</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it open and do my nails I loved the size of the brushes BUT after I took off one of the plastic covers for the brushes the metal came off the handle so i had to super glue it back into place don&#x27;t get me wrong it was a great price but I would have had no problem with paying more to get the item faster and not have it break within the first 5 mins but that&#x27;s what happens when you get a cheaper item, I would have gotten a different item if i could find the right size brushes.</li>
    <li> i loved the way it came packaged neatly and was filled with bubble rap which means that it was handled carefully i used it right away and got perfect results i dont have nothing bad to say about this product at all love it all the way hope they last me a good while</li>
    <li> Stray random hairs all over the place. Can&#x27;t make nice uniform lines because of the stray hairs poking out everywhere.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t  work well...&lt;br /&gt;Waited a month to get them in the mail.</li>
    <li> I will never again order these nail art brushes they are too soft and when going to paint a design it spreads out like a new nail polish brush..</li>
    <li> I recently received these brushes in the mail and I love them!! They are amazing quality and the bristles are the perfect density for the size of the brush. The three different sizes allows for fine detail work in nail art. I love them!! For 97 cents, there isn&#x27;t a better deal out there!</li>
    <li> I loved it I got what I payed for ! The brushes are the perfect design to make creative designs</li>
    <li> My Daughter wanted these for drawing nail designs. She is very happy with them. They hold the polish well and clean easily</li>
    <li> Items where as described and arrived sooner then expected would purchase again. Use for nail decorations designs turn out great. The price was unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Package got lost the first time so wrote to them letting them know and they sent me a replacement. The brushes are great love them. All around five stars for product and customer service.</li>
    <li> After using this product, I used a bit of nail polish remover to clean it and it just made the bristles as hard as a rock.</li>
    <li> The brush tips fell off easy but you&#x27;ll have to glue them for that matter. they are very cool to make little designs. Do not get acetone on the painted part of the brush the paint comes off and will stain your hands.</li>
    <li> I just received them and they look great.  I cannot wait to use them.  Thank you !!!</li>
    <li> Cheap quality but they get the job done.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say much about these because my hand is not steady enough to paint details with these brushes.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! Great for small details on the nails. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase expensive ones with the quality of these. Super affordable and meets my nail needs!</li>
    <li> The black o the stick comes off on your fingers</li>
    <li> These have very fine bristles for fine work on nails. They are what I expected and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I like them and have used them already but I don&#x27;t like how easy the paint comes of the shaft of the brush. Not the nail polish coming off but the actual black paint on the stick part of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Dont buy these. They were stiff and when i tried to put them in the nail polish the bristles came off in the polish and i had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> cant use for nail art. the brush is too thick for nail art</li>
    <li> Poor quality. It arrived damaged.</li>
    <li> Got my package last week and cannot wait to get some time to myself to be able to make up my new nails designs and try the brushes out!</li>
    <li> got the product within plenty of time...the quality is well worth the purchase price...thank you for being so quick with shipment</li>
    <li> stiff and too short to make a straight line.i have to fine a whole new set now. would not recommend</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, but these get hardened with polish and acetone doesn&#x27;t help remove it. Also the metal piece falls off, leaving a rounded piece of wood..so I guess it got converted to a dotting tool</li>
    <li> These brushes don&#x27;t really hold the paint well. I can&#x27;t even get in a full straight line before I have to put more polish on them. Kind of annoying, and ruins my line. Also, don&#x27;t let any polish remover touch the black handle of the EXTREMELY THICK black paint, or it will start to come off and is very hard to remove from anything. I do give it a 2 though because I have used them for a short line, and they were merely OK.</li>
    <li> The silver part of the brush came off of one of the sticks and the others are loose, only a matter of time before they come off as well. Not very happy with the product....</li>
    <li> I was pleased with my purchase of these nail art brushes, to decorate my nails with. The price was great, and they were exactly what I ordered. Pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes were ordered to have some fun, and that&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;re used for.  Great for painting designs on nails-as my 11yr old will attest!  I used the shipping method offered, which required a bit of patience during the shipping time.</li>
    <li> The brush end tips were already worn out. so when i would try to make a small line, i would get about 5 different strikes.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of mixed reviews but I decided to go ahead and buy this product.  When I got it I was really excited. They work great. One thing that you have to do to make them work best is to get the brush wet before you put nailpolish on it.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m not an expert but I just bought these and I tried them&lt;br /&gt;Out. They work really great and the price was even better. Also&lt;br /&gt;There Shipping was fast and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble. :))</li>
    <li> The quality on these is very nice, but I have not used them yet. Maybe when I have some help?</li>
    <li> The brushes came looking like their picture for me, and they get the job done. Though mine were good, one of the brushes were loose, but nothing some glue couldn&#x27;t fix. The reason why it&#x27;s not a potential 5 stars is because I&#x27;ve read the past reviews which state they did not have similar success with these as other people have.</li>
    <li> Well worth the wait.  They work wonderfully. The only problem I have had with them so far is the acetone has started to take the black off the handle.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t  see why I got write a bunch of words for something I like, now if I didn&#x27;t like I have a whole lot more to say. But I don&#x27;t cause I like it, it&#x27;s pretty cool!!!</li>
    <li> when I first took it out of the package the metal part fell right off of one! they are very nice though aside from that and they work nicely.</li>
    <li> The are what they say they are and do the job at a really terrific price. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes have really nice tips but the handles don&#x27;t see to fit the tip very well one is no in line with handle so its a little awkward to use.</li>
    <li> we havent had a chance to use them yet but they are exactly what we ordered so i dont know that there could be a problem.</li>
    <li> soft but firm hairs, i can design great with these and the price is right, only paid a dollar total</li>
    <li> Nice and thin brushes for great precise art.  After receiving my items as pictured I will be ordering more.  They are great for making art come alive.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use one of these for nails but these are amazing for painting I couldn&#x27;t find a better brush for painting I use the last two smaller sizes for my nails and for my make up very amazing product and I love how quickly they arrived and how well they don&#x27;t fall apart I&#x27;ve had these just for a couple of weeks but they haven&#x27;t fallen apart like other professional brushes I&#x27;ve even recommended this for my professor</li>
    <li> The brushes were not as fine as I thought they would be. The way they packaged them they were bent when I got them</li>
    <li> not as small as shown in the pic, but they&#x27;re good</li>
    <li> The handle made it hard to draw with and sometimes fell apart</li>
    <li> These brushes are all right - they&#x27;re kind of hard to hold in your hands and they&#x27;re a little big</li>
    <li> This item I purchased for my little girl and she loves them. They are easy to work with, great quality for the little bit they cost me. Would recommend them to anyone for personal use!</li>
    <li> So I got my brushes in the mail and I was excited they work fine. The only thing is, they look like a DYI project from pinterest. These \\&quot;professional brushes\\&quot; are made out of what looks like bic ball point pens. Even the tips are pens with the thin bristles coming out the end of the pen. Yes for  .99 you cant go wrong but the picture is completely false of what your getting.</li>
    <li> One of them is small but the rest of them,2 are same size. Maybe I have order diffent ones from different seller. As soon as I got them before even use ,the brush came out of their hanldle.-_-;</li>
    <li> When I took ok the cap of the tiny brush it fell apart and i did not like that now I only have two left</li>
    <li> These look exactly as the photo states. I can&#x27;t wait to use them. The brush heads don&#x27;t have any strays, so it looks like I can be precise!</li>
    <li> They clean well and I was able to paint the detail on an antique enameled car badge and it turned out great.  They arrived in less time than they said, luckily for the original lead time was really long.  I did not use them on nails.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! really fine tipped, hair doesnt fall off. pretty cheap and good quality. gotta love them!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very cheap I couldn&#x27;t do the art work I wanted to do because bristles are terrible and coming off as u work! Back to shopping for some better ones</li>
    <li> These brushes do not work well with nail polish -- there are too few bristles to manage the viscosity. And the bristles are poor quality to me.</li>
    <li> Were okay for their price. Just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. But maybe to someone else they are..My opinion.</li>
    <li> i love these so easy to handle and just dip it in a color of your choice!!!! You&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> I Bought these for 1 Sole purpose and that was to put on a thin layer of eyeliner.... And I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. These were soft and durable enough to do what I wanted.👍</li>
    <li> I use it for liquid eyeliner. Very long though😦 you may need to trim the longer one if you use it for nail art</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price but hey, I can work with this, I wanted it to be smaller brushes for fine work, but this will be okay for now,</li>
    <li> Ordered these brushes to practice detailed nail art and they&#x27;re absolutely perfect! Will defininately order more when needed! Thank you!</li>
    <li> They suit the purpose. Naturally, you will have to cut to your own personal needs, but no issues like shedding with most cheap brushes.</li>
    <li> They were pretty good for the price. It took a little long for then to get here, but they came a long way so that is fine. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with them</li>
    <li> One broke before I even opened the package. The brush sizes are nice, but the quality is lacking. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> These sizes are ideal for intricate nail designs &amp; art. I love them, they work very well I am veryy happy to have them.</li>
    <li> makes all different type of lines and strokes let your mind be the limit so many different  thank you  again</li>
    <li> I wish there was a zero-star rating, because that is what I would give this product. One of the brushes broke before I received my package, and the other two broke (1) while I was taking it out of the packaging and (2) while I was using it. I actually used my product for a total of 10 seconds. It was awful. Good thing it was super cheap.</li>
    <li> happy with the product, works, good quality and it seems to fit the bill and will work great for me</li>
    <li> great deal !!  my daughter will love this for her nails !! great for any art project may have to order more for me  !</li>
    <li> I receieved this item with damaged stamped on the outter bag.  Open the bag and there is the plastic wrap to the brushes, but no brushes.  All 3 were missing.  Tried emailing the seller and haven&#x27;t heard back.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on a product that may no show up</li>
    <li> Low quality for a low price. I&#x27;ve had them for months, and have not yet had to replace them. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> The brushes were unusable because all three arrived broken.  They appeared to be made of a very cheap material, so it&#x27;s not surprising they broke so easily.</li>
    <li> when i recieved them they were falling apart. They were only a dollar when i bought them. In this case you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have two daughters and they love having their nails done.  Professional manicures are expensive so I thought I&#x27;d try to learn more and do my daughters&#x27; nails myself.  I&#x27;ve watched several youtube videos and gotten some great ideas!  The brushes are great and allow the great designs I’ve seen in the videos to take form.  So far so good, I have no complaints.  (I’ve used a nail art brush before so I have nothing to compare it too, but I think the brushes work well, they haven&#x27;t fallen apart, and they clean up nicely with nail polish remover.  I&#x27;m not a professional by any means; think these brushes are great for the &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; if nothing else.)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great price.Thank you!</li>
    <li> They are excellent. Great quality. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Great brushes.  Took a little longer to arrive than I thought, but they are coming from China I believe.  But would recommend the brushes.</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;re feeling really artistic with your nails, these come in handy to do more than a big brush could. You don&#x27;t need stripper polish when you have these. They&#x27;re very handy to have.</li>
    <li> I use product for nail designs, works well for writing letters and fine lines. light weight and handles nicely. great</li>
    <li> I like them they look like they would work really well but I have not got to use them yet.</li>
    <li> They were not what I had hoped for. They are not the best at neat lines. I guess maybe I need more practice, but for neater stripes I would recommend using tape or a nail striper.</li>
    <li> My daughters bought these brushes with some of their own precious earned money.  They are junk and almost immediately fell apart</li>
    <li> These brushes worked great for painting ladybugs on my 7yo daughters nail. The shipping was fast and shipped from Florida and I would defiantly buy these brushes again.</li>
    <li> this was my first brush that I ordered .. so the first time I got this I&#x27;m so happy but when I saw some brushes on youtube nail design samples.. I was frustrated to know that they&#x27;ve got the same price but more high quality... But I enjoyed this  Brush for a couple of months...</li>
    <li> nail polish dries out very fast.  not sure if its due to my brand of polish but dried out very fast and didn&#x27;t make pretty/clean patterns.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it looks and feels like good quality. Can&#x27;t wait to get started on this.</li>
    <li> i had to electro tape the titled brush around the metal part but besides that they make nice lines and do what they were made to do.</li>
    <li> perfection packaging was great no bristles were falling out which is good no problems I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> i ordered these as a little gift for my fiance since is always doing her friends nails along with her own. but to my astonishment every brush in the package arrived completely destroyed! (and by destroyed i mean in several pieces) it looks like a much heavier package was thrown on top of these, and since the only thing protecting them during shipping was a bag lined with already popped bubble wrap they were doomed to break. these went straight from the mail to the trash. never buying something like this or from this seller again........</li>
    <li> Maybe I missed it somewhere in the &amp;#34;about&amp;#34; info... but these brushes are VERY big.. Its hard to hold.. BUT for the price and if you really need some, they&#x27;ll work.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these brushes and the quality of work they provided! I love the sizes, they fit all jobs and then some! Wish they came faster!</li>
    <li> Average. If i could go back in time i would look for ones with a smaller handle. The long handle and you non-dominant hand dont work so well together. Also keep away from acetone polish remover. My friend burned a hole in my nail striper hehehehe!</li>
    <li> Good quality, nice handle, easy to hold.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes arrived broken... But the other 2 work well</li>
    <li> Bristles all have glue dried in them.</li>
    <li> Im glad this was only a dollar and some change because the product just kind of falls apart. The medium length brush has some sort of glue or tack on it. The longer brush popped off the handle and it mad me quite sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t plan on returning it, just fixing it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Just splurge a little and buy quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Help to drew in detail!</li>
    <li> Very thin brushes will give you fine lines, I am already using it for creating color nail painting, also for painting as well:)</li>
    <li> Horrible quality. Not worth the dollar something I paid for them. They fell apart after I used them like 3 times</li>
    <li> These took forever to come! They are very well made...not light at all. They came in different size brush ends and very pointy and fine. I&#x27;ll be trying it out on my toes to see if it will look professionally made.</li>
    <li> The silver part of the brushes came off, I guess it wasn&#x27;t glued on right or something. It works but wish they were a little better.</li>
    <li> I actually use this to do my eyeliner...it works like magic!! Very percise!! Couldnt beat the price either. My old brush cost over $20 &amp; didnt work this well.</li>
    <li> The brushes are too hard :( and rather them painting over my nails, they are so hard they scratch my polish</li>
    <li> These set of brushes i order two set but only got one set.</li>
    <li> I got these in the mail and a week or 2 later finally got around to trying them out.  Well, I INTENDED on finally trying them out.  I opened the pack to find all 3 of them broken!  Right where the metal and the black handle meet!  Sure, I knew they were cheap but still!  Totally unusable!</li>
    <li> I order this on Nov.18 today is Dec.26 and i still waiting for it. It doesn&#x27;t even have a track number yet.</li>
    <li> Look out if you get acetone on these brushes- the black on the handles comes off and gets on everything. Does not come out either.</li>
    <li> they fell off the stick when traveling and the that didnt get broken when you used them they broke</li>
    <li> The price was right for these brushes. You can&#x27;t do better anywhere else. I love them and use them all the time and not just for nail-related projects. I will purchase again once they wear out!</li>
    <li> They hold there tips well as long as they are well cleaned. When they first arrived they had a weird odor that lasted for a few days, it might have been the plastic handles were still hardening. All n all, worth trying considering they are inexpensive.</li>
    <li> These work very well but they frail a lot. Other than that they create very good designs when used right.</li>
    <li> This product is a really good idea and is awesome on the nails. One problem that I had with it is that it is packaged badly. I don&#x27;t think it is good to package something in a plastic tube. Because when I took it out the brush came off the stick and the fluffy hairs fell off too. I do think the product works and I do like it just not good packaging. Hope I helped!</li>
    <li> The fine thin hairs work very well and cleans up easy without falling out. I&#x27;m glad that I bought them.</li>
    <li> I received them earlier than expected which was lovely but you get what you pay for. I took one out to see it and the top fell off. I will glue it back no biggie. Point I&#x27;m trying to make: don&#x27;t expect super amazing quality for that price. Hopefully they perform better...</li>
    <li> I loved the quality of this product!! Fine and precise!! Would recommend to someone else.. Would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Got my package in the mail, opened it, and saw that one of the brushes had fallen off its &#x27;stick&#x27; and I tried multiple times to glue it back on but failed. Overall, it&#x27;s a cheap product. Dont buy.</li>
    <li> I would like the brushes to be a bit larger, I found myself going over lines multiple times. Other than that, these worked well for what I needed them for!</li>
    <li> Saves money..why would you go out and but 10 diff bottle of polish just because you want a smaller brush. These were only 72 cents. Took long to ship but its all good though no worries at all.</li>
    <li> love my brushes in everyway priced to perfect for I will buy more soon I will never go in a store and buy them again in sold .cam as promised</li>
    <li> the hairs keep falling out and very stupid please do not buy a big waste of money there only good with acrylic paint</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived a lot sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;You can achieve lots of different designs with the brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush tips fall off the brush handle constantly.  Very poor quality!!  Now I know why they are so cheap.</li>
    <li> You could create so many design in your nails. the precision is good and very manageable. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> cool widths of brush for varied nail art designs. I&#x27;m going to learn to do nails like the girls at the salon.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered these three months ago and just got them. Every brush was broken. She is so disappointed! Boo!</li>
    <li> Were a gift so I rely can&#x27;t review I don&#x27;t know if I would by them again . Shipping was OK. We will try them out this weekend to see how they hold up.</li>
    <li> Decent brushes. They seem to be made well. Have used only once so far with no issues. Would buy again for extra set.</li>
    <li> Brushes are cheap and one arrived broken. I guess you get what you pay for, but I would have saved my money.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes very much worth buying if ur into nail designs as much as I am &amp; I do alot of designs.</li>
    <li> During free days I always make sure to paint my nails and I love doing it by myself, it&#x27;s like an art, you see. I find these brushes very fine and smooth. The tips have different dimensions depending on the design that you&#x27;ll draw and I like them that way. I can draw tiny details and large ones as well. Ia m never getting tired of these brushes.</li>
    <li> For the price these brushes are of great quality. It did take a little longer to receive than I expected, but good product.</li>
    <li> I would rate this 5 stars but 1 of the brushes was broken but other then that it was good and easy to clean</li>
    <li> fast delivery, good packaging, good quality, cheap. quite a bargain, brushes work well, the hairs of the brush don&#x27;t fall out (at least they haven&#x27;t for me yet).</li>
    <li> The brushes are great quality---for how much they cost. The brush hairs on mine fall out all of the time and they stick out so it&#x27;s like i can almost paint two things at once. But for $0.80, they&#x27;re great!! And the shipping is really fast--mine came about two weeks earlier than the expected shipping date!</li>
    <li> Great for the price ❤ didn&#x27;t expect anything better maybe I would look for shorter brushes next time but these are also great. Love it</li>
    <li> Perfect👍👍 I love my brushes I thought that they would of been cheap after reading a few of these reviews I&#x27;m glad I brought them anyway</li>
    <li> If you are an artistic or creatively equipped person, you&#x27;ll love these brushes. They are really good for designs and decorating. It does take a steady hand and a lot of concentration to do it properly but I love them non the less. Took awhile to get here, but i&#x27;m not a rushful person.</li>
    <li> I was excited about these brushes but when I got them I was utterly disappointed. The pens are too soft to make any type of design, the bristles just spread out. Next time I will read the reviews beforehand. I guess now my siblings can have some fun with them.</li>
    <li> I use these pretty much every time I do my nails. The fine tips are perfect for detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come all the way from China and they&#x27;re very cheap so some of the metal brush tips may have fallen off of the black wooden handles by the time they get to you. But that&#x27;s no big deal. Just stick them back on with some super glue or nail glue and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean the brushes with pure acetone after every use.</li>
    <li> The metal tips are not secured to the handle at all. I tried to use these on a nail client and the tip fell off while working and wiping the brush. They are just not a good quality handle. The brush works fine once you spend time gluing the handle to the bristle on each brush.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken. Not cool</li>
    <li> I ordered these to make small designs on nails and they work just like there suppose to. they go here when they where supposed to so im pleased. Will deff order more.</li>
    <li> They are okay if you are a beginner at nail art but other than that you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This brushes have a nice heft and feel to them. My daughter does her own nails and these were just the ticket. Price was unbeatable. Delivery was not quick.</li>
    <li> I just thought these were ok. I did not like the length of the handle. Not easy to work with. The worst part was the shipping. I filed a report for it not ever coming way after the date it was supposed to be to me. FINALLY they showed up WAAAAY after. Will never buy from here again.</li>
    <li> The items arrive din the mail broken. Product made very cheaply!!!! Not worth the money even if it is a low price. Can not be used.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact that I was supposed to receive these in early December I just got them in early January.  Yes the delivery was extra late but totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again??? If they promise not to take that long lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 star cause they took longer from what I expected and was told. If they would&#x27;ve had been on time I deff would gave them a 5 star</li>
    <li> I have so many nail polishes. I really enjoyed using these.  Good for beginners, easy to clean.  It&#x27;s a good set. I was happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> Loved these. A must have for anyone who likes to design their nails with ease. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These brushes were perfect for what I needed them for. I have now been able to expand my nail painting techniques!</li>
    <li> I guess for the price I couldnt ask for anything better.  It sure does its purpose but one of them broke in just a couple of months</li>
    <li> Today this arrived to I started using  one of the brush , &amp; It broke in 2 mins. Basically the silver piece got detached from the wooden piece.</li>
    <li> got the item quickly but the tips fell within first ten minutes of use. glued tips back on and has been fine since.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but seem to be good quality. Brushes are different sizes which is what I wanted. Happy so far</li>
    <li> I was so excited for these to arrive and when they dis they were broken.  One of the tips came off and the bottom of one had looked like it had been sliced off.  So disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> Love the sizes. Not able to find these in the store in my area. My oldest daugther ask for a set of her own.</li>
    <li> Packaging was impossible to open. And it ended up breaking in the process. Brushes are weak and hair like which is not appropriate for nail polish at all. Overall poor quality brushes and very difficult packaging. But I suppose it is understandable for there price and therefore, cheap material just like the cheap price. Only positive thing I can say is they were delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 14 year old daughter who loves doing her nails. They are very easy to use and are of decent quality. They are also easy to clean when done being used.I would order again!</li>
    <li> One brush was broken when received. Other than that the brushes are ok.  I&#x27;m still practicing my nail art skills</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price.  The ones I find in stores are too big for my purposes. I was looking for a brush that I could do detail work with and these are perfect.</li>
    <li> The metal tips fall off handles very easily. I tried gluing them back on but they keep falling off. Better off going to the art store.</li>
    <li> They broke on my first use.. very cheaply made. I will not buy these again. Shouldnt have spent my money on these</li>
    <li> I finally received my brushes! So far they are working well. They have a good grip on them and are comfortable to hold.  Not very happy with shipping but the brushes are cool.</li>
    <li> The metal part is not very well attatched but that can be fixed with glue. Fair for the price. No problems with shipping.</li>
    <li> nice and sturdy, durable brushes! they make the finest lines and are so well put together.. very happy i got these..</li>
    <li> The packaging was great but I took forever to receive at least 3 weeks and the brushes are very soft, not good for nail art at all.</li>
    <li> its bigger then expected full size brushes. wanted to added on for my nail art brushes collection an its worth it</li>
    <li> The brushes were great at first but then seemed to fray after continual use</li>
    <li> does not draw very well on my nails</li>
    <li> this is a very cheep product. the brush broke off on my first time using it! it is not worth buying!</li>
    <li> I ordered two. One for me and one for my mother-in-law who also does nails. We both loved how small they looked online and we both fell in love with it really wanting to use them for nail art. However, when they arrived they were ok in size. The smallest is about the size of the largest in the picture. But they will do Thanks!</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t good if you really want to make nice thin, precise lines. the bristles are all separated and are really hard to work with. but what else should you expect from such a cheap product?</li>
    <li> the nail art brushes are really good, I can even draw a very thin line.&lt;br /&gt;I can even make designs on my nail, there is one brush in this 3 which has a 1 thread which helps me draw a fin line and i can even draw curves. Love it &amp;#60;3....</li>
    <li> eh these are ok I just wish the little bristle wasb broken when I got it and that they were a little thinner</li>
    <li> honestly this is a product that is unnecessary and i wish i could get my money back because i feel like there was not use for it, and they made it sound very cool but in reality you dont need nail brushes.</li>
    <li> i rate this a 4 because it is a good value for the low price. i am satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> I was excited to try these brushes, but was highly disappointed.  The packaging was horrible, there wasn&#x27;t any protective box or anything, a piece of cardboard would&#x27;ve helped secure the brushes from being broken.  The smallest brush was broken completely in two from the metal piece down.. the brushes seem to be made of a cardboard material.  I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you buy so cheaply.  I know now to spend a little more to get quality.</li>
    <li> Pretty close to what I expected and the different sizes were a plus but the brushes separate from the pencil part</li>
    <li> This brushes are pretty good to do your nail art with. they are made well and take on the nail polish with no issues, I don&#x27;t have any problems with picking hairs out from the nails, and it gives a way for details. Pretty good product for the price. They have a wood handle and come in 3 different sizes.</li>
    <li> I love this. Exactly what I have been looking for. Easy to clean and can keep it in plastic. Makes nail art easy.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, good product, look and feel nice, cant wait to use them!&lt;br /&gt;the brush part is longer than pictured which i love!!&lt;br /&gt;good price!</li>
    <li> I was waiting for my package very happy and CAME BROKEN 2 OF 3 Nail Brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a Shame</li>
    <li> I bought these to do something more fancy and flirty than regular acrylic nails for homecoming but that is weeks away and I couldn&#x27;t wait to take them out and play with them. Well, I did only a few nails but they&#x27;re great. They  don&#x27;t stick together and get hard if you clean them properly. It doesn&#x27;t leave awkward streaks from the brush separating. They flow nicely and cleanly across the nails.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I had been really needing detail brushes for a while nd these were really inexpensive. They took a while to get here but they are really nice the bristles are bcery soft they work well when using them it&#x27;s really comfortable. The only thing maybe I didn&#x27;t like they come with the little protective covers for the brush tips nd one of them was broken which was ok bcuhsz it still covered the brush part but I was trying to take one off it was so stuck on there that the whole silver part came off so I was kinda sad but for less than two bucks I liked the rest of the brushes and I fixed the one tht broke so no problem now they are so easy to maneuver ull be happy</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t very good for anything. Hard to use, not thin enough to do any designs. The silver part keeps falling off the wood handle. Kinda a waste. Bought a whole kit for about the same price with much nice brushes.</li>
    <li> too thick and when I go to use them on my nails, they get streaks.. not my favorite. I&#x27;ll be ordering a different kind..</li>
    <li> I realize that in the professional nail industry, they use a lot of chemicals and wear masks and such, but I&#x27;ve always assumed it was due to the actual polish and treatments for the nails. Well, I purchased these to use for watercolors, not nail coloring, as they looked like they would be good for tiny details. The bristles look nice and firm and intact, however, when I opened this package the fumes from the brushes were like a punch in the nose. Within minutes the whole room stunk of this toxic smell just from me sitting them on my desk. It is the handles that stink. I don&#x27;t know what they are made of, if it&#x27;s the coloring then I&#x27;d much rather have plain white or clear handles, wood...any other thing than what is being used to make or color these handles. After 15 minutes, one of my migraines kicked in from the fumes so I put them back in the package and shipping envelope. Now, if you work in a nail shop and wear a mask, this probably won&#x27;t affect you, however, if you are an artist or hobbyist who wants these to use at home, just be forewarned that the odor they emit is pretty pungent.</li>
    <li> The bristles spread and the tops pop off. its very difficult to do design. I didn&#x27;t get much use out of it . a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when these arrived and they were broken immediately upon opening.  I will have to glue them back together.  The brushes look nice so hopefully they hold up after going them back together.</li>
    <li> They look much thinner in the picture! When I cleaned them with acetone they kind of expanded a little more not my favorite but they still work!</li>
    <li> its  ok i am berly starting with the nail art an this are good for practicing really like it alot</li>
    <li> I have to say Im very impressed! I really love them yet I have not tried them I already know they will work great! There is a big difference in each size of the brushes so some people are wrong on that. And they are perfect for nail art. A second thing people have been wrong. I believe people just want something to complain about. I love them thank you very much! Better then I thought they would be by far!</li>
    <li> Two fell apart the first time i used them.I wasn&#x27;t really happy with them.At least they were not expensive.Worked okay once i glued them.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes my girlfriend and her daughters have alot of fun with these, design a bunch of nails</li>
    <li> I receive them and when I open them two of the three were damage. I&#x27;m not complain but the price was cheap so I couldn&#x27;t expect more. I fix them with hot glue and tape so they do the job.</li>
    <li> These brushes suck, they broke as soon as I opened the package I had to tape them back together. I would not recommend buying these. Next time I&#x27;ll make sure to read the reviews.</li>
    <li> I love to do design work on my kids nails.  These brushes have allowed me to retain my creative side!</li>
    <li> I opened the package and took the brushes out. One of them fell apart immediately when I touched it. The bristles were bent and out of shape. Was not happy. I do not recommend them.</li>
    <li> These look professional, they have fantastic bristles for small and intricate designs, and they wash easy. Definitely recommend if you love nail art!</li>
    <li> I received these after about 3 weeks (ridiculous), shipped from China, and they came damaged!&lt;br /&gt;two of the metal tips fell off immediately, i had to glue them back on myself. not only that, but the stench of these was so bad I put them outside within 15 minutes. They smell like paint thinner? Also, had white paint all over the metal of one brush.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how they work, but if they&#x27;re falling apart within minutes of opening the package, I urge you to buy something else.</li>
    <li> I was worried before I got this brush because some reviews was not really that great. But I did it anyway . Overall these is really good buy and these is exactly what I needed for.if you like super tiny detail designs these definitely the right brush for you. Just like any brush takes care and clean it right away it will last for a long time. TRUST ME on my experience...</li>
    <li> If you use them for nail polish then logic only tells us that at some point we will have to clean them with nail polish remover... the problem is that that whole handle of the brush is painted with lacquer sooo.... as soon as you get them wet it dissolves and is a BIG MESS especially when you are right in the middle of doing your nails!... had to throw them all away...</li>
    <li> I love that they protected the bristles in shipping with plastic tubes. they are in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> prepare to glue the tips to the handle</li>
    <li> I personally would not buy these again. They are made of very cheap quality and look nothing like the ones in the photograph. Drawing a thin line is nearly impossible with these brushes, and nails aren&#x27;t big enough for these huge bristles to create a design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning the nail polish from the brushes, the bristles actually started falling out, which rendered them useless. Then the flimsy silver parts also detached from the brush itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely stay away from these. Get what ya pay for!</li>
    <li> I love you so much it was really easy to use. easy to use I definitely have to hear more of the brushes</li>
    <li> I love these to death best thing, that i got out of the mail when i ordered all my nail products</li>
    <li> Great took a while to get but they were worth the wait. I use them right away and they are made of strong material</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 4 star and not a 5 only because when I received them the medal part to the tip was not fully glued on to the stick it self. as soon as i went to use them, it fell off. so i had to super glue them myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other then that, .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for nail art. I love them. I dont want anyone to get the wrong idea. As with anything, something can go wrong and this wasnt very bad. So this is a must have product if you love nail art.</li>
    <li> The bristles came totally bent and frayed and the metal part that holds the brush on falls off all the time. I mean, I guess you get what you pay for, but damn these things need help.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
    <li> NOT GREAT AT ALL FOR DESIGNS. CHEAP</li>
    <li> Nice quality brushes, very happy!</li>
    <li> I personally use them to add important detail to my fondant work.</li>
    <li> i really like these brushes because they are so cheap and great for a beginner in nail art. they have really fine tips and are great for making really tiny details on your nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth it, but like a regular brush, it gets hard really quickly and hard to clean, You could honestly go buy paint brushes and get the same result, but I do honestly like them, if I sound like I&#x27;m ranting I&#x27;m not! They&#x27;re great! I use them a lot, but they wear out easily.</li>
    <li> The bristles were not as thin as they look in the pic i had to thin it out myself.. disapointing..</li>
    <li> This product, straight out of the package had a horrible chemical smell. The tips of the brushes were very uneven and very rough. The first time I used it, the tip came apart from the handle and I had to glue it back in place. I would not recommend these to anyone.  I only gave it one star because it shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> The quality was definitely poor. I didn&#x27;t even get to use the brushes because the silver part came right off the wood stick when I took off the plastic from the brush. I just wanted to toss them all away. It sheds as well. .87 and free shipping, I guess it was worth only that. Maybe even not.</li>
    <li> Not as thin as i expected.. bad quality</li>
    <li> They are okay, the brushes are very fragile and they don&#x27;t paint evenly because the tips are breaking. One of them fell apart right away, they are not good quality</li>
    <li> another item essential in your arsenal of you equipment to work with nails  love it an all my customer too</li>
    <li> I got this product as nail stripers for all the color polish I have and it just did not meet my expectations. It is hard to remove the color from the brushes and the designs I am going for are not easy to accomplish with these. I would not get them again.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for these due to the great price, however when they arrived I tried to use them and it literally fell apart because the top metal part was glued to the wooden piece. Disappointed, but I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much from such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> work well so im happy and got.them for a good proce also so i qill probly.order agin sometime aoon q</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect for making designs on my nails. They are the perfect size and if you have a steady hand you can go crazy with decorating your nails.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a project and the two that were usable were fine :)  Given what I paid I can&#x27;t really complain tho?</li>
    <li> Steady work from wonderful brushes. they fit my medium size hands perfectly.</li>
    <li> These brushes do their job. They can be used to paint just about any design on a person&#x27;s finger nails.</li>
    <li> ehh not that good. Took a while to come in. I just opened it and one of the brushes broke. Cleaned the brush and the tip got dried up and is stiff. Works umm well.</li>
    <li> Cheap.  The bristles are kinda bent I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this item.  But it may have been the two sets I bought, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> They are light weight,the brushes are just the right size for detailing. I paint my own nails,painting flowers,hearts ,balloons and other designs,they also  clean up easy They did not come in any sort of case, but that&#x27;s still fine. The brushes are great for the $.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they were a great idea for all nail art&lt;br /&gt;But I got them in broken&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the dollar I spent at all your better off at the dollar store</li>
    <li> I used these to make the lines on my three year olds nails for lady bugs. her nails are so small it makes it hard to draw stuff on them but these made it easy!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use yet.  But the design alone will be a great experience with fine lines with painting details on nails!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very cheaply made. I don&#x27;t prefer them to the polishes that come with the designer tip. So I just clean the tip off and use it for my other polishes.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes for nail art designs and they fit my needs well. They came with the metal pay off the brush coming off, but all I did was glue it back on and it works prefectly.</li>
    <li> Okay product. I wish the nail polish would stick to the brushes better though. But for only paying like $1, they&#x27;re satisfactory</li>
    <li> This item arrived late. When I finally received it, the tips were bent and frazzled. Not that great for small details on nails. For the price these were alright...can&#x27;t really expect too much.</li>
    <li> took a little longer then expected but very happy with the product</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to love these brushes but when they arrived one was broken!.... Also, I thought I would be able to do some cool designs but they seem to be a bit too thick</li>
    <li> The brush tips aren&#x27;t very even making a it more difficult to create nice lines. But they were very cheap to buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. I think some of the hairs are already starting to come out, but It&#x27;s ok. Also it doesn&#x27;t have any of the pretty writing that&#x27;s pictured. Just some zeros or o&#x27;s engraved.</li>
    <li> Love them. Perfect fine tipped brushes for intricate work. The long handles allow for precise control, and the tips are perfect with no fly away bristles.</li>
    <li> They do the job for the most part. I had to trim a few errant hairs.</li>
    <li> I like this affordable quality , its very cheap and practical , i ordered many different items and they all came on time plus the cheap price and the nice quality</li>
    <li> Perfect for the tiny painting I needed to do on miniatures ( Warhammer 40K)</li>
    <li> Cheap price, cheap quality. They smell like cheap paint too. I wasn&#x27;t able to do any designs with these because they are way too soft for me. But they&#x27;re ok for stripes.</li>
    <li> Tips fell of right away</li>
    <li> I mean it&#x27;s cheap so what do you expect!? Don&#x27;t waste the money they don&#x27;t work and you can&#x27;t really do anything with it!</li>
    <li> They are ok products. You don&#x27;t expect too much when you pay this little price. I guess I couldn&#x27;t make too much use of them because I&#x27;m not an expert, still need to practice to improve my skills.</li>
    <li> The brush tips are very nice and neat, they make nice defined lines, and are great quality brushes. They look identical to what is pictured, and they arrived in a good time. I highly suggest these if you&#x27;re looking for brushes for nails.</li>
    <li> these are for my daughter...she loves to do her nails and with these she can add the extra fun touches</li>
    <li> Do their job...now if only our creativity would of come with them!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, now I&#x27;m able to do the designs that I want with my nail polish on my nails :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update! 7/20/14: I used 2 brushes because I had no need to use the third one. I had to use the third one today because I wanted smaller designs on my nails and the part connecting the brush to the body came right off. Took away two stars for that.</li>
    <li> off first thought was a great find until the brush feel off the stick holding it, glued back together,but okay</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product to use on my nails. The sable brush is great for painting on ceramics. It&#x27;s sturdy.</li>
    <li> I hated these brushes and will never buy from the seller again:( I was so excited to use them so when i tried using one of the brushes it immedialty left clumps on the brush  and wouldnt even paint my nail art</li>
    <li> I got these little brushes for my nail art hobby. They arrived sooner than expected, which was a nice surprise to come home to. The ends did come off easily and there were a few bristles poking out in wild directions, but I&#x27;ll trim them up and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll keep on going. For the small price, you can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
    <li> Good product. I still have to practice how to work them but its worth the price. I don&#x27;t really know how to clean them good tho. Overrall Good product!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for my nail. The only issues is that it&#x27;s hard to get a good amount of nail polish on the tips because they&#x27;re very hard. Also when i first got them, the package &amp; the actual brushes had a really gross smell &amp; smelled really bad until i had to wash them.</li>
    <li> great set of detail brushes to use with anything, great little sizes, came protected very worth it cute little brushes</li>
    <li> Very nice fine point brushes are perfect for small details.  I love them and the price was stellar.  They took a little long to arrive but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do. Works just fine. Although the brushes seem too think still, to do detailed designs.</li>
    <li> Good nail brushes for just amateur design not really a whole Lotta difference in size but they&#x27;re still very good brushes</li>
    <li> I have many art brushes, many I have paid a lot of money for, but these are great for the price!  Easy to clean, larger handles for good grip, and they seem to keep their shape nicely.  Best part is &#x27;no heartbreak&#x27; about having to replace them when they wear out.</li>
    <li> This product gets one star only because zero is not an option. I ordered this product months ago ,I have yet to recieve it.This was supposed to take only 3-5 days and has ended up taking 3-5 months</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived late and the quality of the bristles suck! You can&#x27;t do any nail art with them! I&#x27;m a nail technology student and these didn&#x27;t work at all! And when I tried to clean off the nail polish the color of the brushes rubbed off and made a mess everywhere ! I will not buy from this seller again !</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, the quality was not the best but then again it was only $1.00 so I have nothing to complain about. The brush and little metal part fell off on the first use. I used glue and put it back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well when working with nail polishes or acrylic. My brushes were delivered the next day after I ordered them so that was pretty exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend ordering if you know how to make good use of these brushes, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Cant complain too much considering how cheap. Had to re glue the silver brush holder on arrival over all Id order more</li>
    <li> This was maybe about the worst thing that I have ever purchased, beside nail dotters. The only way this would be awesome is if you got your money.</li>
    <li> Great for following nail tutorials. I will totally look into buying more items for nail art and design. Thank You</li>
    <li> These are amazing. The only down on this is that the tops aren&#x27;t glued on the stick very well and one came off.. Its easy to pop back on but im guessing any glue works.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this brushes. But when I got them I opened the package and one of the brush heads wasn&#x27;t attached to the wood handle didn&#x27;t even look like they glued it at all and the smell of spray paint or something was so strong on them it gave me a head ache just not what I wanted...</li>
    <li> This product came in broken.  I&#x27;m trying to put them back together but have had no luck.  I&#x27;m sure if the product wasn&#x27;t broken it would work great.</li>
    <li> Great product came weeks earlier than expected super excited would recommend to others and purchase from this seller again. Thanks</li>
    <li> The brushes were coming apart as soon as I took them out the pack. They are cheaply made and not well put together.</li>
    <li> The hairs of the brushes were all apart and twisted.  I think it was due to the way it was packaged.</li>
    <li> The brush is perfect. I can write really well with it. And it keeps my hand steady.&lt;br /&gt;Love it .</li>
    <li> These are cheap but they work. you get what you pay for in some cases but these aren&#x27;t too bad</li>
    <li> For the price this product really isn&#x27;t too bad, but considering I could probably have found something similar in a discount store or beauty supplier for not much more I was a little disappointed in the quality - they are worth what they cost. They do what there supposed to though, so if the price is right and you don&#x27;t mind waiting for a longer delivery than this should be the right product for you.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of tiny brushes. I bought them actually for art work, not nail decoration. They were an amazing deal. I can&#x27;t even imagine how they could be manufactured that inexpensively, then shipped all the way from China, and still be so inexpensive and of decent quality.</li>
    <li> The tip of brushes are too soft. Overall, you get what you paid for...not a quality product at all! period!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my grandaughter who is 13.  She loves doing other peoples nails and she finds the brushes easy to use to put on her designs.</li>
    <li> when I tried cleaning the brushes with nail polish remover to take the nail polish off the black paint comes off &amp; the actual brush came out the day I got it</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and so easy to use.  They don&#x27;t clump the nail polish on.  They are thin enough to get precise lines.</li>
    <li> l love these brushes, but...&lt;br /&gt;The bristles do spread out (as another reviewer said)&lt;br /&gt;The paint starts to come off the handle  when i clean the brushes&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package it smelled of fresh paint&lt;br /&gt;I love how there are three types of bristles, a short &amp; long striper &amp; a detailing brush&lt;br /&gt;The long striper is a little difficult to use, I guess it will work</li>
    <li> These have made it so much easier for us to make great nail art at home. Great quality. Very hyappy with this product.</li>
    <li> It does not work very well and they broke after two uses. but i guess i got what i paid for.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Ordered them for doing eyeliner and nails. Cant beat the price and they seem real quality! You don&#x27;t need to spend $$$ for stupid brushes when these are fantastic!</li>
    <li> These brushes make lovely strocks.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product get it on time. this is what I was  expecting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! so much !</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used these yet but they look like they are quality brushes. will use after christmas as these are a present.</li>
    <li> I can not wait to see the amazing nail art that my daughter and I can create using all this fun nail stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. The are perfect for tiny details. Good quality and a great price to boot! Didn&#x27;t take as long to ship as noted when I ordered these. I was glad to see they arrived in time for my Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> These brushes suck. The bristles are too stiff and don&#x27;t apply nail polish very well. I also received a broken one amongst the three I received. DO NOT BUY THESE.</li>
    <li> I love the way my nails to look after I leave the salon after having treated myself to an expensive manicure.  That&#x27;s the problem, manicures are very expensive.  I saw these Professional Nail Art Brushes, from World Pride and thought I would try them.  They are made of a high quality sable. The package contains three brushes: a fine detail brush, a medium liner and a long striper.  They worked well.  They are easy to clean. It will take a little practice to get my nails to look perfect but they look pretty darn goo.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> They arrived in great condition and I immediately put them to work. they&#x27;re perfect for small art work and the back ends make great pressers for stones or tiny stickers.</li>
    <li> The tops fell off after the first use! The brush itself was frayed with bristles sticking out everywhere. So cheap. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for these a little flimsy</li>
    <li> I thought these would be cruddy, but I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy for so few uses. I was wrong, they&#x27;re great. My daughter-in-law loves them and she does a lot of nail art. Good value.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced for the quality. Shipping as expected. Won&#x27;t last very long. Good for beginners use. Not sure id buy another set.</li>
    <li> These broke almost immediately after I got them but it&#x27;s okay because they were only 70cents they are also very stiff even after wetting</li>
    <li> Brushes look as expected. Good size. Just bad quality. After not that many uses the silver part of the brush broke off. You could probably fix it with super glue though</li>
    <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
    <li> They are cheap. And cheap is what you&#x27;re going to get. First off, when you wipe them in nail polish remover it takes off the blue-ish black color on the brush. Also after a few times of removing polish from it the metal came unattached from the wood. And lastly, the brushes remain hard. Like they were dipped in clear coat, which makes designs lumpy and unattractive. I would recommend buying, but only if you were a beginner.</li>
    <li> Great fine tips in 3 different sizes.  The only con I have found are the handles. They are as long as a pencil.  So when detailing my nails it is harder to manipulate them for the design. would have given 5 stars if they had shorter handles.  But for the price I still love them.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t played w them much to really rate them.  Used once didn&#x27;t really do much for me or i&#x27;m just not good at nail art.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend, all brushes were broken. Not really sure why they thought they wouldn&#x27;t break with the way they were packed. The bubble wrap envelope barely fit them</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes thinking they would speed up my manicures but they did just the opposite! They won&#x27;t come clean and they leave little fibers in my nail polish.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awful.  The metal part isn&#x27;t glued to the wood good enough and and the tips keep coming off.. No good..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently developed an interest in nail art beyond just the basic manicure. While I&#x27;m still new at it, I&#x27;ve found these brushes to be quite helpful with clean up as well as decoration. I get clean, crisp lines, and they&#x27;re very easy to store and clean up after use. For the price, an awesome value and necessary addition to the collection of anyone interested in nail art!</li>
    <li> paint coming off after my daughter use it only once. She was cleaning the bushes with remover, and the top of the bush turned white.</li>
    <li> The brushes are firm &amp; don&#x27;t bend up all crazy, not cheaply made &amp; work very well! The brushes are much easier to clean as well. A+ Will buy them again!</li>
    <li> I had ordered several sets of these at once as I use them and go through them quite quickly and before I even took them out of the package most of the bristles in several of the brushes were already frayed and unusable.</li>
    <li> I can not recommend this item.  They are very poor quality, not even worth wasting your pocket change on.  Every one of mine were broken and unuseable.  DO NOT BUY THESE!!!</li>
    <li> Horrible product, not worth the money at all.. I opened them and pulled the first brush out and the tip fell off and so did the others. Did not get to use them once and even if I had the brush tips are not the right type of material to do nail art. Heed my warning, DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could I would give zero stars...</li>
    <li> These Art Brushes are very useful , I can design with them and they are very light weight. I love them.</li>
    <li> The brushes are not good! They stick together n they&#x27;re is a white coat or some build up on it. Also one of the brushes came all bent up! Waist of money!</li>
    <li> These are good for beginners or non professional nail artist. They can also be used for any other craft projects.</li>
    <li> When I got these in the mail they were ALL BROKEN!!! It made me so mad. There really was no way to fix it. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Although they aren&#x27;t exactly the same as the picture \. They are fine brushes, sturdy and easy to clean. Does beautiful detail and the wood on these brushes is very strong! I love it! For the price i recommend it!! Thank you! And for coming from China the package was more then on time!</li>
    <li> Its an inexpensive kind of brush that does a fine job in making nail art in adding the finishing touches,  but I do admit that this brush would not last longer than 2 months with me.&lt;br /&gt;Because it is inexpensive and it does work for me it is a 9.2 in rating.</li>
    <li> I use these to repaint doll&#x27;s faces and they are the best brushes ive ever used and ive evn had those 6-10 dollar brushes from the craft store..these are way better than them</li>
    <li> brush was falling apart</li>
    <li> Daughter loves and uses them everyday.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes and for the cost, it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean Loos</li>
    <li> These are good for designs on nails, but you have to make sure not to let them dry out</li>
    <li> they broke almost immediately</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work the way I though they would  ............. I thought they would be better not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because of the tips of the brushes. When i tried painting my nails I wanted thing lines, circle etc; like thats the reason I bought it. But it turned into blah, I personally didn&#x27;t feel comfortable when painting, but the friends love it. Know I only use it when painting my free edge (known to be when having long nails the white area) I did buy it for making pretty details but... it failed.</li>
    <li> had so much fun creating intricate designs and nail art with these...great price and came quickly :) priced much better than at beauty stores</li>
    <li> Very easy to handle when drawing or styling a nail art design. I would buy these again if they break.</li>
    <li> Great price and easy to use</li>
    <li> The silver part from the brush broke off within two days of owning it. The brushes do what they&#x27;re supposed to and everything so I can&#x27;t complain. Just wish it didn&#x27;t fall apart so easily. Fixed it with nail glue.</li>
    <li> I am using these brushes for decorative painting, not for nail art. These brushes work well for painting tiny miniatures with acrylics. They have sufficient control to paint a good comma stroke and fine lines. Recommended for tiny fine painting projects such as jewelry or miniature doll furniture.</li>
    <li> took too long to arrive but the brushes are nice . 😏</li>
    <li> sturdy brushes. shipping took a few weeks though</li>
    <li> Great price.  Takes a while for shipping, but worth it.</li>
    <li> works great. would buy again and recommend!</li>
    <li> I wish one of them would have been thinner, but they have been great so far.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a 9 year old and she didn&#x27;t like them very much cause of the brushes would harden. And I think it&#x27;s worth buying but make sure you take care of the brush after you use it on fingernail polish. So I would recommend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> They are great quality and an absolute steal for the price!  These are sable and could be used for other applications where a delicate line is required.</li>
    <li> I got these hoping that they would be great quality.  When I opened them the bristles were hard and the wood was cheap.  The whole thing was cheap. I am sure I can find something to use them for.  I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very good for doing cute little designs, however I have already had to glue the part with the actual brush back onto the wooden handle.</li>
    <li> These were good a few uses. After cleaning them a few times they fell apart. The metal/brush fell off the wooden end. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and an excellent package of brushes.  My wife and daughter were very pleased with the designs that mom was able to create thank you so much</li>
    <li> These brushes are better off to be used as putting on eyeliner or something. The bristles did not give a good stroke when I was trying to use it for nail art. Two thumbs down.</li>
    <li> The brushes came early and Im happy for that. The material of the handles are pretty good but the metal that connects the brush and handle are sloppily put together, the ink is already faded and I can see all the excess glue. Other than that they seem sturdy and lasting</li>
    <li> For all the small details and then some...these brushes are really wonderful  The magic is in the hands of the user!</li>
    <li> The brushes are extremely cheap but are a nice quality brush for the price. I&#x27;m not sure how they will hold up after repeated use but overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I use these for art work not nails...they are detailed for small strokes and work well with all kinds of medium.</li>
    <li> I purchased these with the intent of using them for nail art, and that is what I use two of them for, but my husband has taken one of them to use on the models he puts together, saying they work better than the brushes he bought for that purpose.  I think they are great and make it easy to put small designs on nails (or models).  Would recommend to anyone that is going to need something to make designs with.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. For only a dollar, I received three, in somewhat good condition brushes. The only problem I have with them is that the tops came off, but nothing a little hot glue can&#x27;t fix. The bristles are good! There was a tad bit of a chemical smell to them straight out of the package.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a must for your nail art needs, the various sizes allow for various designs, they clean well and are sturdy.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and my friend loves them. She might not use them as nail brushes but she can definitely use them for other things. Nicely made as well.</li>
    <li> I love brushes over the nail strippers, They seems to give me more control over How I move the brush</li>
    <li> my daughter actually ordered this product to make designs on her nails. Even though some of the brushes fell off she was able to glue them back and use them.</li>
    <li> Came just as the picture on the web is, but smell horrible but I just left it outside for a day smell is not strong anymore.</li>
    <li> They pretty much do what they are meant to, just take care to keep them properly cleaned and they will last for awhile.</li>
    <li> I gave them to my sister but I guess u get for what u paid... They didn&#x27;t really work that great</li>
    <li> Did not like the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Brush not very stiff. Could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the size looks about the same.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of these brushes. If you get nail polish on the handle of the brush the black paint literally melts off. I would not buy again despite the cheap price. Invest in some nicer brushes.</li>
    <li> The are great for the price not the best brushes but they are great for the price I would buy them again I&#x27;ve been Using them a lot and they hold up</li>
    <li> There a bit bigger than I thought they would be, but other than that there good quality and great bargain and they came on time, so awesome sauce.</li>
    <li> OK so I ordered these and they came in about 2 weeks. Which is awesome because I wasn&#x27;t expecting them for another 2 weeks. Well I&#x27;m a beginner in nails so I was so excited to get these for so cheap. I will definitely use these for practice.</li>
    <li> These brushes were very inexpensive.  They are ok for the price.  The first time I used it they brush part separated from the handle.  Nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed with some glue.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it and do some cool nail designs. They come in three different sizes so you can do almost anything.</li>
    <li> Product came before scheduled time, it is as shown.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to use them.&lt;br /&gt;Will reccomend.&lt;br /&gt;I am just a little concerned whether or not the brushes will be steady enough to create designs</li>
    <li> Very, very happy with these nail brushes. Exactly as described, arrived in a timely manner. Very happy with the way my nails turn out when I use these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great they are perfect for when I do my nail art and I can precise with my details</li>
    <li> They came early from what the estimated delivery date said. they&#x60;re great I love them, and so much easier to do nail designs with i really recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are Great brushes! These are the best for doing decorative painting on your nails! Easy to use. Absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good size brush. Unfortunately, The grip is uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;And break easily. I only have used one and it already broke.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good for clean lines and dots on nails. I, personally, use the medium sized one for a liner brush on my eyes. I like it.</li>
    <li> Arrived before the expected date.  Handles are sturdy, bristle tips are clean and nicely shaped.  In comparison to brushes I&#x27;ve bought at craft stores - EXPENSIVE brushes - these are similar quality and better price!  Will look for these again!</li>
    <li> I really have to buy more as my husband loves them for his plane models too!</li>
    <li> These seem real cheap because it&#x27;s thin plastic but I will try them out!!  I hope the brush isn&#x27;t as cheap as the handles!</li>
    <li> Wish I had more of a sturdy hand tho! ha!</li>
    <li> So I used this product about 9 times already and no matter how many times I use it or clean it, the bristles remain in great shape, and just thank you for this being at such a low cost, it does wonders :&#x27;D</li>
    <li> These were a waste of money in my opinion.  The length of them alone made it very hard to use and the brushes were impossible for nail polish.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use them for painting.  presise good size and easy to hold.  Nice brushes well worth the price.</li>
    <li> they delivered in perfect condition, but it was a little hard to try to do designs on them... they are still good though</li>
    <li> This product is good for what its worth! It came in the mail pretty fast. I would purchase more products again.</li>
    <li> Nice product but very bad/strong chemical smell. It is a very good quality but it smells very strong of chemical.</li>
    <li> They work really well and the brushes are just the right width for doing any kind of nail designs, no matter how detailed.</li>
    <li> These are very precise and so small they work wonderfully in everyday painting. I use them for painting eyes and they can go where regular paint brushes just can&#x27;t get. I am a stickler for details and these are perfect for most medium and work well in small hands.&lt;br /&gt;You surely won&#x27;t get a brush like this for this price at the art store. Even though they came from China, they are very good quality and it only took 3 or days to get them here. I am buying more for sure.  I haven&#x27;t used them for nails, not even once. But I use them more than any of my other brushes on ceramic and bisque. But, mostly, they work very well on the vinyl doll kits where detail is key.</li>
    <li> well... first of all I ordered these in December and they are just now arriving in late January. yes they are cheap but that&#x27;s really the only good thing. They have a VERY strong, foul smell &amp; the bristles aren&#x27;t that neat. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love these!  They are very fine bristles and work great for making fine lines and drawings on nails.  The bristles seem in there good, I don&#x27;t do nail art professionally so they may not be that quality but they work great for me. They came very quickly too.  I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> The metal isn&#x27;t attached very securely, mine are all loose. I figure if/when they come off, I&#x27;ll just krazy glue them. No biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles fan out more than I&#x27;d like... hard to be very precise if trying to draw thin lines or small designs.</li>
    <li> I expected these brushes to look thin like the picture, but they are really thick and bushy... say bye to straight lines!</li>
    <li> I have yet to receive this in the mail, i have the correct adress and proof of the purchase, if there&#x27;s any way i can fix this please get back to me</li>
    <li> I am not a professional, but think that this is a very nice brush set for nail art, at a great price</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter to do her nails with, she said that she likes them and that they are easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them  He will use them for his fine artwork that he does. He does some fine work projects that these will fit right in with.</li>
    <li> 2 of them are broken, one I can maybe fix but the other one is completely not fixable . I&#x27;d save your money!</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I wanted! I absolutely love these brushes, they are splendid for making interesting nail art. Yay!!</li>
    <li> When i got them in the mail i took one of the brush out and the brush part fell off but i fix it with my hot glue gun .</li>
    <li> I just got the brushes, along with that 15 piece one that keeps on showing up. They arrived relatively quickly, considering they were from China, and in tact. The brushes are nice and solid and have some good weight to them; I only wish that they were a little bit less bulky. While the 15 piece set was very streaky, these brushes were fantastic! They left clean lines and were so easy to use. Not a streak to be found! They held the color very well. I&#x27;m just a beginner, but I&#x27;m looking forward to working with these little guys since they seem so promising. One brush had two or three hairs out of place, like they were too long, but I easily cut off the excess.</li>
    <li> works great. perfect for what I wanted to do. yes slumber partys nails partys dot tool and konad nail stamper</li>
    <li> It got here on time and was very easy to use it is exactly what it says it is and work great</li>
    <li> I thought I would get a more precise line by using these brushes...it didn&#x27;t really make a difference on my design.</li>
    <li> Love dhow cheap they were when I bought them. Great brushes for the fine details! I recommend this product to any proffessional</li>
    <li> These are just okay. The are too stiff to use for designing nails. Maybe I am just not professional enough. :-)</li>
    <li> I got this nail art brush set for my daughter because she is really into doing nails and she loves it.</li>
    <li> These are the lowest quality brushes I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy these. Find something else.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, so you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Spend a couple more bucks and get &amp;#34;Everydaysource Nail Art Design Brush Set [15pcs]&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! they came in great condition and work very well! I would recomend these brushes to anyone who wants very professional nail art brushes!</li>
    <li> Perfect brushes for at home use. Had to glue the silver part back on black body but no biggy.  Item came apart when I took pulled the plastic covering off to use for the first time.  Again, no biggy, nothing a little glue couldn&#x27;t fix.  I kept the plastic covers to help keep the bristles nice.  LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!!! You cant beat it, they are a wonderful add to my nail art tools and I was amazed at how fast they got here considering the distance traveled.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> They work great and serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> Extremely hard to clean and they were really hard to use the only one that kinda works in the smallest one the #000</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes. They are good to hold. The brushes are smooth. Mine arrived in good condition. On some of the brushes the number &amp;#34;#000&amp;#34; were smudged off. Maybe accidently. I frankly don&#x27;t care because the brushes are what I wanted. I use these brushes to do micro painting. They hold up well with oil paint. For this price I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> Great nail art brushes very sturdy and well built if I could give it mire stars I would</li>
    <li> Fell apart, needed to be glued</li>
    <li> Brushes are as described, works well for designing my nails.</li>
    <li> 2 of my brushes came broken.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. I expected something cheap for the price but I got a great quality tool. The handle is long which is great for support and it gets the job done easily! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t always get what you&#x27;re trying to do.&lt;br /&gt;Brush strokes tend to be larger than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;But overall not a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;I would get them as a beginner.</li>
    <li> the were great to work with and arrived earlier than said they work great for the details on acrylic nail</li>
    <li> I would certainly recommend for someone like me just starting out. The price is definitely right. No problems with delivery and the brushes work very well.</li>
    <li> They look good, haven&#x27;t tried them out yet!  Not going to use for nails. I think they will work for some fine work while painting with acrylics.</li>
    <li> The darn brushes fell apart before I could even use them.  What a waste of money.  They were poorly made. They were just not to my liking.</li>
    <li> I received this product only a few hours ago and while I was a little thrown by the fact the package didn&#x27;t fit them and they stuck out, they were in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came nearly a week earlier than expected to my surprise! The metal that holds the brush and the handle aren&#x27;t glued together well. I can take the brush portion off if I want too, which is fine for me since I can clean them easier this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviews have mentioned, they are soft and are definitely not good for highly detailed designs except maybe drops. I did spray them with hairspray and they seemed to stiffen. I really like this product as a person who doesn&#x27;t do her nails too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One odd thing has occurred though. When I went to clean the brushes, I also went to clean off some nail polish on the handle because I got a little messy. When I did this, black stuff came off onto the cloth I was using. When I touched or held the handles, nothing rubbed or came off onto my fingers, but when I tried to clean it with nail polish remover, this black powder like substance came off much easier than the polish did.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, I am enjoying the product and will probably use them for either nails, eyeliner or a lipstick applicator.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. For what she tells me it is a really nice addition to her nail decoration</li>
    <li> Fairly cheap. The tip fell off of one of the brushes. I guess you get what you pay for. Low quality.</li>
    <li> these brushes are very nice.  Nothing fancy, and that is okay by me.  I like the control I have with them and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good tools for your nails to decorate to make professional design for your nail art. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Finally received in my mail two days ago.Very nice, well worth the money. They work great on your nails to decorate, or for your eyeliner, eye shadow..awesome. buy them u will love them.thanks..</li>
    <li> My child is happy now.</li>
    <li> These are good brushes .</li>
    <li> Much better quality than I was expecting. I got these for my goddaughter, she is really into nail design so I bought her a bunch of items from this seller because the prices were so great. Going to put it all together and give her a nail design kit for Christmas. I think she will be thrilled.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very fine, and allow you to put your own design on your nails. My daughter loves them!</li>
    <li> The product was just as it said I received it 2 weeks earlier than said and works well its close to a pro grade id definitely recommend this product to a beginner or intermediate nail tech</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month already and I still haven&#x27;t got my brush! Now that I read the reviews I want to return it right away!! 😞</li>
    <li> Great brushes...well put together not cheap in quality at all. Well worth the price to. I would recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I have this a 4 out of 5 because the brushes are a bit stiff and hard to use hopefully I can soften them a little to use them well.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 2 stars out of generosity. I liked the price so I bought it, took a month to arrive. One of the brushes was damaged and I am not pleased but since it was so cheap and I have other brushes I decided not to contact seller. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap price (but also cheap product) this is for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s came in a promptly manner and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> this brushes are so small the art work will look great and professional, I got several brushes also. since this are gifts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it because I thought it&#x27;s worth of money for 3 brushes.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I opened it up it seems like not new but used ones. Brush heads are all mashed and not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to spend extra to get another sets.</li>
    <li> I love them. I ordered 2 sets. If you&#x27;re looking for something small for your artwork, these are them. I use them for sculpting but they can used for just about anything you need a small brush for.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING! They arrived about 2 weeks before the estimate delivery.. but i didnt give the full 5 stars because the bristles are just so soft... when i do designs they spread out and kind of ruins the design... other then that, they work good :) but i dont really know how to use the biggest brush (#0) because the brush is so big and the bristles spread out so much :(</li>
    <li> They work very well and for the price I really cannot complain. I looked other places and they were just too much.</li>
    <li> The brushes are not very good quality.  The bristles stick out on some of them and don&#x27;t create a good line with the nail polish.  That&#x27;s probably why they were so cheap.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really use them for nail art. I thought these were going to be stripers, but the brush is so short and stubby. Also when you attempt to paint with them the brush frays and messes up your design. Not to mention the fact that they broke as soon as I got them. The entire top silver part just fell off the handle. The material is really cheap but I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you pay a little over a dollar.</li>
    <li> All of the tips fell out before I even got to use them</li>
    <li> I received my brushes today.I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look nice. I can&#x27;t wait to try them out. Also they arrived early so that&#x27;s always good:))</li>
    <li> My wife loves to paint her nails....I ordered two sets of brushes...she absolutely loves them....what a great value..fast delivery....its all good</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with these brushes at all. They became stiff and gross very quickly. I threw them away after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> They work great and the price is right!</li>
    <li> I got these took for ever and you can&#x27;t really do any designs, the bristles of the brushes are not very good</li>
    <li> Brushes seem to do a good job.  Amm happy with them.  Seem a good deal for the money spent on them.</li>
    <li> have not used yet. Item arrived intact and quickly. Will probably be using soon. I am learning how to do my own nail decor and believe these will be a great assess to my collection of nail equipment.</li>
    <li> Brushes dI&#x27;d not last after first use. They feel strong but the hairs aren&#x27;t great</li>
    <li> I ordered this and was so anxious to get it, only to be completely let down after waiting nearly a month for it. I was supposed to receive 3 nail art brushes. Instead I received a damaged package that contained 3 sticks and two pens. (No clue why the pens were even there).</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes. Be careful with the handle portion though. If nail polish remover touches the handle, the color will come off.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes for nail art! Definitely worth the purchase, makes designing your nails much easier and faster than toothpicks or tips of pencils.</li>
    <li> THey were only a couple bucks so you get what you pay for. :) If you want quality, these are not for you.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes I think I got a great deal for the price and quality of the brushes. The are easy to handle and come in different sizes.</li>
    <li> We really like these brushes...along with using them for nail art, they can be used for highlighting for Henna! Can&#x27;t beat the price either!!</li>
    <li> I like the brushes but it&#x27;s not as thin as it looks on the advertisement. But it&#x27;s also a hit and miss. Out of the 10 sets I&#x27;ve ordered only 3-4 set is thin and pointy like the picture. The other ones doesn&#x27;t even come to a point when it&#x27;s wet. Smh.</li>
    <li> The brushes look nice. However the head fell right off the pen/wooden part. Luckily I only paid a lil for them</li>
    <li> These are okay brushes but if you are looking for something long term, these are not it. They are not stripers they are much more thick than that. I cut them to make them into what I needed but they are ok.</li>
    <li> Look very cheap but they are so I guess in this case you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Not possible to give zero stars. The brushes were really cheap (cost) and you get what you pay for. 2 fell apart the first time I tried them.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just basic brushes to do fine art with. The material isn&#x27;t the highest of quality but not the lowest. Luckily I received the products undamaged, as I know shipping from another country can sometimes be rough. Other than that, these were a better bang for your buck than going to a craft store for the same quality.</li>
    <li> I received these 8 days earlier than expected! I&#x27;m so excited about using these. Will update once I try them out. They seem sturdy :)</li>
    <li> They work but not as thin as I pictured but hey works enough and hey for some reason amazon sent me a dollar when I got the brushes in the mail so .70 cents for three brushes can&#x27;t beat that right.</li>
    <li> they are okay, i do alot of nail art and i thought they would be thinner, but you can always cut them!</li>
    <li> After two uses the tops of the brushes fell off but I super glued them back on and they work great.</li>
    <li> Great product; great seller, great price</li>
    <li> works good but after using it about a dozen times i need to buy new ones. i guess it was still worth it considering the price.</li>
    <li> Wow! So professional. NAIL DIVAS IT ANOTHER MUST! You cannot go without this brushes lines are perfect.  Brushes sooo easy to handle. Regular nail polish is fine but if you use acrylic paint for your nails You need these brushes! So easy to handle and easier to Clean.</li>
    <li> Good for the price but they came broken and I had to super glue them when they arrived, but for a dollar what do you expect.  They get the job done.</li>
    <li> Had to use a glue gun to make the tips of the brushes more sturdy. All in ask the brushes are great..... Clean up very easily.</li>
    <li> The price is good but it wasn&#x27;t  what I was looking for. It the tip was longer n more flexible designs would be earlier to do but over all it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
    <li> I love using these art brushes so much, when you get your pair you will see what I mean.  I have at nother pair that I have not used (there nice ones too) because I got these ones first.  Great buy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It came in a set and couldn&#x27;t pass up the price. They seem fine and I wills see how they last.</li>
    <li> This is utter garbage! Save yourself the dollar and go buy something else. After more than a month of waiting, I was super excited to use them. But I got my hopes up for nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trying to paint designs, the brush just spreads out, leaving a wide line instead of a sharp, thin one like I imagined. I might as well just use a regular nail polish brush. And the nail polish won&#x27;t come off the brush after the first use. My brush is still tinted with red!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So save yourself the money!! I will not be using these again. They are going straight into the trash. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Great brushes!!!  use them all the time when doing my own nails.  Can not go wrong with the price or item.  Delivered as they stated they would be - packaged very well!!!</li>
    <li> hairs weren&#x27;t staying in</li>
    <li> The piece of pops were all broken, probably made in China!!! Junk! Don&#x27;t even think about purchasing. You get what you pay for, I should have know better!</li>
    <li> This option is way cheaper than buying individual nail stripers. So far so good. Glad I bought these. Cant beat the price</li>
    <li> Quick and easy ordering. I&#x27;ll be sure to order morr often! Thank you for making it so simple!! I&#x27;m spreading the word ;)</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because these Nail Art Brushes allows you to do/make all sorts of hip nail designs. This was bought for my young cousins and they love it.</li>
    <li> it may be cheap but its not worth it. I&#x27;m not the smartest when it comes to nails but I wasn&#x27;t able to do anything with those brushes except for regularly painting my nails. nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> They took a little to come in, but they are beautiful and they work great!! :)</li>
    <li> They have a strong smell when they first arrived so I had to let them air out for about 3 days. The brush handles are a bit big and make it hard to handle correctly. Save yourself time and see about getting some from your local craft store.</li>
    <li> one brush came broken,my feedback not so good i am not satisfy . i&amp;#34;m not recommend this product.. no no</li>
    <li> I really like that I was able to get three brushes for such a cheap price. One of the brushes came with the silver tip detached from the wooden part. It was just the effect of the heat on the glue. I used my glue gun to put it together again, good as new. Other than that I would say that even though I haven&#x27;t used them yet. They appear to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes a lot. Yet I find the bristles always come out very easily. Sometimes I actually use these for my gel eye-liner and it works great. Its actual purpose for nails is amazing too. Precise everytime well....most of the time.</li>
    <li> The brushes broke very easily but they were still okay and did the job for the time before they broke.</li>
    <li> These arrived early, and look to be great quality! They do have a bit of a smell to them, but nothing that really bothers me. I would repurchase from here again, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for so don&#x27;t buy these thinking they are going to be professional brushes however they do allow me to do a lot of cute designs so i am satisfied. one of them comes apart but all I have to do is twist it back together. 83 cents is something you can&#x27;t complain about.</li>
    <li> The black wood and the silver will come loose. I fixed it with m super glue. The tip is okay. It&#x27;s good for drawing lines and small animals. The order came in after 14 days, because it is shipped from China.</li>
    <li> Perfect for precision or for striping. Love it and the price is a bargain. It helps my nail art look professional. Thank you!</li>
    <li> If you need a fine brush for anything not just nails...  this is it... high quality bristles, cheap, sturdy and with handles big enough to hold with a tapered ferule.  I bought 4 sets so I can give them to fellow artists who use various mediums and they said they started using them the same day because they like to do detail work.  None of the art stores around here have anything to match at any reasonable price and these are a bargain.  Amazon does it again... thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> It was what I expected. It makes nail designs easy to do. I also like the money I saved. Great</li>
    <li> Just as my title reads blah these stencils suck. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so cheap. I was better off without even having them.</li>
    <li> These are of very poor quality and one was even completely broken by the time I received them. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. Arrived super quick, and are of great great quality. Definitely something every artist should have in their collection.</li>
    <li> They shipped super fast, and I was surprised at how big they were. Which is a good thing for me. The only thing is that they broke fast. The silver piece easily broke off on one of them the first day then the next day another one came off from the other brush. I can super glue it so it&#x27;s no biggie, just a hassle.. That&#x27;s why I rate 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Though I don&#x27;t like how long shipping takes I&#x27;m always happy when I do get my stuff. Product works very well for my nail art. It was cheap but not cheaply made. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Very. Good just clean after use</li>
    <li> Use these tools all the time. So versatile!</li>
    <li> Love them, they came exactly as how the picture looks, I use them every time I do my nails.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> Got these as a gift for my friend, she loves them.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but I guess it was okay for a dollar something</li>
    <li> My brushes came apart where the bristles attach.Before they came apart they apart-- I thought they were nice.</li>
    <li> Daughter uses these and is happy with them.</li>
    <li> The brush tips are slightly different from what was shown but they are forth it since they were so cheap.</li>
    <li> before I bought these, I bought some other brushes that turned out to be cheaply made and I haven&#x27;t bothered using them. these brushes, however, have definitely made up for that flop. just keep them soaking in acetone when not in use to prevent polish from drying and damaging the brushes; they&#x27;ll be easier to clean that way. I ordered 2 of these, and each came with 3 brushes.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a little clumsy to use, and I had to trim down some troublesome stray bristles, but overall they get the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a nail brush... I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I didn&#x27;t really think it was a a wise purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good to make some details in your manicure. Fast delivery. I used to make Santa&#x27;s hat at my daughter&#x27;s nail. They loved it!</li>
    <li> I got them within 2 weeks from ordering them so I was glad they came early. I can really only use one of them because the brush is perfect size its thin so I can do stripes and stuff but the other two brushes aren&#x27;t very useful there fat and hard to do designs. There worth the price tho</li>
    <li> I chose four stars because the brushes work well the first time you use them, however the nail polish is hard to get out of the brush. I tried leaving them to soak in nail polish remover over night. Of course, that ate away at the black paint. (I just painted them a new color.) In the morning, most of the polish was gone but the bristles were a bit hard. Oh well!</li>
    <li> these are great for my daughters nails. she is four and we can paint great with these brushes on her little hands</li>
    <li> They are ok for what I use them for. I create my own nail design, they are a little hard to clean.</li>
    <li> As soon as we opened the bag they came in, the metal part came off the wooden handle part of it.</li>
    <li> This set of nail brushes was very satifactory. I was suprised by such the low cost, but very happy with the resolt!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I love doing my nails. They are really a great buy and you can make small designs on your nails more precise with these brushes. I would recommend these brushes to other people.</li>
    <li> The bristles were hard and didn&#x27;t seem to go well with my nail polish. Also, the tips for the brushes have fallen off in the second use.</li>
    <li> Very cheap but  cheaply made. They are fine since I am no professional. I just like to try out different nail art so these are fine.</li>
    <li> love it  thank you so much</li>
    <li> Some tips fell off but excellent value!</li>
    <li> When i received the brushes one was broken. Then, the others broke as i tried it out. It&#x27;s very affordable, but i didn&#x27;t even get to use it at least once.</li>
    <li> I bought two sets of these brushes, one for a friend and one for me. While not outstanding, they are very convenient for making thinner lines than the brush from the nail polish bottle can make. Just remember to clean them well after each use, the only complaint my friend had was that they get stiff if not cleaned thoroughly. Well worth the very little money spent!</li>
    <li> These nail art brushes are working so well. The price is cheap and it does come with three different sizes. The only problem is that it does say what the sizes are. It is obvious that one can tell what the sizes are based on how they appear. Long rounded handed makes them super easy to design with.</li>
    <li> The tip are too thick to paint the nails.</li>
    <li> They work good, I&#x27;m the one that doesn&#x27;t know hot use them, lol</li>
    <li> Brushes arrived with in 3 wreks not broken and work nicely!!! Love them will be ordering another set.</li>
    <li> Get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I bought them for miniature painting. Have the tools, the right light source, the paint and some nice shiny brass buttons. Then I got sick. Go figure.</li>
    <li> The metal part comes unglued from the stick.</li>
    <li> These are great size but if you get any paint remover or acitone in the brush handle the black gets all over your hands. Tooo messy !!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter who is a nail art junkie. They aren’t professional grade by any means, but they satisfy my daughter and she’s happy with them and that’s all that matters.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this and got eyelashes</li>
    <li> i have been waiting for this to show up for the past two months. I am still waiting for it to show up. but i should of expected such considering the low price.</li>
    <li> These brushes smelled like chemicals and dont make the best design i will never buy again</li>
    <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t meant for nail polish. The bristles fall off and are cheap. Only used it once.</li>
    <li> Its taking forever for them to come.  I know it was cheap but it shouldnt take this long to ship.  maybe it will come sometime this week if not I will never be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> Works great for nail art or projects that involve painting very small areas!!</li>
    <li> Not very pleased with these.  When I pulled them out to use them the tip detached from the stick so I had to glue them back.</li>
    <li> Bought a few sets of the brushes. Some will be used for makeup and nails while the others are used for painting and crafts. Great deal!</li>
    <li> dudes, these brushes are worth the price you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;when i was trying to clean the brushes the whole thing fell off and by &#x27;thing&#x27; i mean the silver part with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, these brushes are too thick and too for nail art.</li>
    <li> Fast &amp; cheap shipping, immaculate condition, great price, no nonsense, and absolutely no complaints from me :)</li>
    <li> When I opened the package there was a strong smell but i left the outside and they smelled a little better. If you are buying it for eyeliner don&#x27;t its no stiff enough. And is not stiff enough for presise nail art its okay for the price but i dont really reccomend it.</li>
    <li> What a waste of time and money.  These brushes arrived, bent and crushed in the package.  When I tried to take off the plastic, the brush tips came right off.  Guess I need to try and glue them together so they&#x27;re actually secure. These are NOT ideal for nail art.  I should have gone to a hobby shop or an art supply store.  These will be thrown away.  I&#x27;d upload a photo so you can see what they REALLY look like but Amazon&#x27;s not giving that option.</li>
    <li> A cheap tool to help with your nail art</li>
    <li> great for small detail work , holds paint well ,( enamel model  paint ) able to  do some dry brush techniques also ,</li>
    <li> Not sure if I want to work with the brushes seem too open not firm, Still trying to find creative ways to use them.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, very happy with these brushes. I&#x27;m just started to learn nail art. This is going to fantastic to learn with.</li>
    <li> have not tried them but they look like they will work fine.  in appearance they would be rated higher than a dollar store version.</li>
    <li> I have a daughter who loves to do her nails and her daughters nails. This and the other things I gave lets them be creative.</li>
    <li> It was just reg. Paintbrushes. Not very impressed. But it was long time to ship. But i made use of it</li>
    <li> i liked these small brushes because&lt;br /&gt;1. perfect for small designs&lt;br /&gt;2. easy to make deisgns&lt;br /&gt;3. different sizes&lt;br /&gt;what i didnt like was NOTHING!!!</li>
    <li> Its inexpensive but one of the heads fell apart right on first use. Other than that the were able to use the other two brushes as described.</li>
    <li> easy to do and I like the way is working thanks so much i hope i can got some more.</li>
    <li> They broke really fast it looks like they are not glue the right way or the glue they use is very cheap.</li>
    <li> I ordered these mostly because of the price but also because I needed new brushes. When I opened them they looked perfect. They size of the brushes was great. However, after I used the first one it fell apart. The bottom metal part fell off from the wooden stick. I guess I can just glue it back but it would&#x27;ve been better if they were made properly.</li>
    <li> Brushes work good but if you get anything on the handle and try to clean it the handle gets tacky and I wind up throwing them away</li>
    <li> I can not tell a difference in the sizing other then the numbers are different. I haven&#x27;t used them yet so they may apply differently. I will change to five stars if they have a noticeable difference in application.</li>
    <li> Like the title, it is very easy to use. I use the thickest one for lines, and the smallest for minor details, like touch-ups.</li>
    <li> great brushes with a range of sizes. good for fine detail on images. These are good quality. you wont be disapointed. Try  these out.</li>
    <li> I was excited to purchase these brushes, and they did not disappoint! I was about to get more precise in my lettering and details in my designs!! A great great buy!!</li>
    <li> Good items to do nail art and would be using this item... I would recommend people to get this it to make straight lines unit they get better... it would good to start with... Thank you for this item and would put it to good used.</li>
    <li> I bought these nail brushes because I love to do my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are well super cheap in price &amp; material.&lt;br /&gt;I took off the nail polish color with nail remover, and it took the color off the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Also the brush tips are super hard not like a brush soft, so you can make designs.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend this!!</li>
    <li> will be trying these soon  they look and feel good  anyone would love to have then and the price is very good</li>
    <li> I expected the brush tips to be smaller and easier to use, they&#x27;re kind of big though, making it hard to draw detailed designs on nails.</li>
    <li> I wanted bold dots or straight lines i could create with these but i couldn&#x27;t. After use it would fan out. I don&#x27;t like it images comes out blotchy if you tired on your nails. A no no for me</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brush are longer than it looks in the picture which makes it a tad bit harder to use. Also these came from China so took over a month to get here. I give it a 4 because it does the job.</li>
    <li> I tried using them for eye liner as was suggested and found them a bit hard to use.  Maybe I just need practice.</li>
    <li> The product is as described, it&#x27;s excellent ! I like it and I recommend this product very much ! Thank you !</li>
    <li> These nail art brushes - professional nail art brushes-sable nail art brush pen are really nice and the quality is great. Ilke them</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it u can&#x27;t paint with them</li>
    <li> They look kinda cheap.I hope they do the job . They just arrived today and it took kinda long.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t your money guys</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price! I like the handles, they&#x27;re simple but comfortable. They are also easy to clean, would repurchase</li>
    <li> I like it it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services and i like to give 5 stares</li>
    <li> These fell apart shortly after the first use, but did serve the purpose that I needed them for and they were inexpensive - so you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, good quality!</li>
    <li> i didnt use them for nails however they worked great for the small detail when i did my paintinings</li>
    <li> Perfect for painting little figures</li>
    <li> Terrible! dont waste your money on these. even after you get the nail polish off the bristles it still sticks together in one big hard clump. good for one time use.</li>
    <li> Brushes are as described, good quality, easy to use. They work very good for detailing.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I first purchased these brushes. I&#x27;m a bit of a nail freak and have been doing detailed nail designs for years. Alas, I realized that it may be beneficial if I purchased detail brushes instead of just using detail brush polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was amazed by the price and since it was my first brush purchase I didn&#x27;t know what to expect so hopefully, you all can learn from my mistakes. They are not stiff enough to make solid, thin lines. I found that when using them, each bristle fanned out, instead of remaining together in one unit. I ended up with a thicker line than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, cleaning them up was disappointing. With each cleaning session (tried nail polish remover and then nail thinner), the brushes would get drier and more fanned out, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I suppose they are great for the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them. The strands are not made out of the right material.</li>
    <li> Brush falls out.very cheap</li>
    <li> My brushes came and I really disliked how the bristles they came bent and bushy. Not thin at all like the picture. So I cut them (: and since I cut them they work so much nicely then when they were fluffy. I would not recommend this to anyone because you should receive what you order exactly how it looks in the picture. And not have to tamper with it. I would&#x27;ve given this no stars but since I had to fix these brushes and I like them now I will give them 2 stars the price of this is also not bad.</li>
    <li> Just the right sizes and the detail that one can do with these brushes is right on spot. Worth the purchase. Just remember to get brush cleaner along with brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really not meant for doing nails. I have to get the nail polish to dry on the brushes because the bristles are to frayed to give straight lines. I would not buy again</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes.  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you,  it has high quality usage.  I use it all the time and love it every time. Nice doing business with you!</li>
    <li> Easy to use for Nail art and I really like them</li>
    <li> I bought these expecting them to feel cheap and low quality but I was very pleasantly surprised, whenever I need to replace them I&#x27;ll be ordering these again. The brush handles are thick enough to hold comfortably and the tips are small enough to do details nicely.</li>
    <li> The tips keep falling off... not the best brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This tool is a very good for doing designs. The length of the brushes helped out with doing the designs. It overall a wonderful item.</li>
    <li> Ive&#x27;d used it a few times and it has a very nice look to it. It&#x27;s very easy and elegant.</li>
    <li> Were in pcs in pkg(I repaired) Don&#x27;t believe sable. Will trim and see if can use. Not hopeful. Again, cheap.</li>
    <li> Good brushes but the silver tops (the brush portion) fell off as soon as I unwrapped. Easy fix with super glue.</li>
    <li> these brushes will be great for my fine art paintings. For what thank cost I purchased two sets. Why pass up a great deal.</li>
    <li> they are so cheap and its not glued in properly and the hair is so cheap and cheap! I think it sucks dont buy it!</li>
    <li> needed these very much thanks</li>
    <li> These brushes came in sooner then estimated but the quality was horrible . two of them were broken and they had an extremely bad smell to them that made you dizzy . will never purchase from world pride again .</li>
    <li> I use them as eyeliner brushes and work good for that purpose the only down side is that the bristles are very loose</li>
    <li> When I got it was packaged correctly and it was fine. I took them out and one of the bruhes fell off the handle. Makes nice lines but it&#x27;s hard when the brushes keep falling off the handle.</li>
    <li> hard to work with but cheap so it didnt matter</li>
    <li> I still have not got these brushes, and I&#x27;ve been excited about receiving them but I&#x27;m beginning to feel disappointed...</li>
    <li> I had to trim the hairs to make them smaller and pointed.  The bristles either fanned out, too long, or were just too fat to work with.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used 2 out of the three brushes and both fell apart when I tried to clean them with nail polish remover and a cotton ball.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on these.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting 3 different brushes but the they are exactly the same.</li>
    <li> very nice brushes, better than I was expecting for the price.  I have only used them once but I was happy with them and I will recommend them to my friends.  thank you</li>
    <li> Still waiting had been like a month would like to be able to use the items I paid for... hope they come soon or will have to start looking else where for nail stuff</li>
    <li> Very good brushes for nail designs.</li>
    <li> i love doing nail art to my mom sister friends and to myself. These brushes just makes things easier, one did arrive broken but i&#x27;m ok with 2 and the price is really good.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price paid.  They seem to be sturdy, ok quality.  If you are looking for really good ones this ones are not for you.  These nail art brushes will do the job but I don&#x27;t think they are long lasting.  I will be using this ones for adding  touch paint to my wood carvings.</li>
    <li> The hairs fell apart quickly and the metal came off the wood. They aren&#x27;t too bad, just fell apart over time and regular use.</li>
    <li> Brushes are ok but not quite the professional quality I was looking for.  They didn&#x27;t work as well as they should.</li>
    <li> Great price and I ended up using these as paint brushes for fine lines.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughter and she just loved them.</li>
    <li> These are good brushes.  But don&#x27;t get the wood part in the nail polish remover because the paint will come off onto your hands and whatever you set them down on.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really be too upset considering the price of these brushes, but they aren&#x27;t all that. All in all they get they job done. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for beginners but if you know what you are doing these work just fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Get the job done without losing any bristles.  No rusting.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> For a great price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> These brushes are a good choice. I like them I was looking for brushes to draw more and the detailer brush is great. quick shipping of product.</li>
    <li> these came late (like a month late) and they weren&#x27;t that good of quality and they broke within a few dyas</li>
    <li> I must have bought the wrong product. Did Not do what i was hoping it did, make straight lines. Its good for making flower peddles.</li>
    <li> One of the smaller brushes broke off after the first use, but other than that they were a good purchase.</li>
    <li> These are alright They are good but it the washing part that is the tricky part they are a bit fragile</li>
    <li> I fell in LOVE with the 00 brush in this set, but then the acetone I was using to clean the brush ate the glue holding the bristles in place and now it keeps retracting when I try to use it. Very sad</li>
    <li> Received my brushes today and all but one was broken. I was really looking forward to this and now I have to buy brushes all over again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice beauty user and was pleased to come across these inexpensive brushes. They are excellent quality and the perfect set of sizes for starting a nail art collection. They arrived quickly and are absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> Detail pens I&#x27;m excited about this product I&#x27;m ready to display my artist skills. The price was right.</li>
    <li> good brushes what I really liked is the price cheap on the pocket book but not in quality over all great product</li>
    <li> Very detailed, and just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a good product and good price.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it loved it loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Sandy</li>
    <li> Brushes are good but hard. I use brushes all the time and these are hard. The brushes manipulate well and the handle feels good to my hand.</li>
    <li> order two sets .the brushes itself seem fine (bristles) but the handle and everything is poorly made. crooked and also singed bristles on some. It was stuck to the plastic covering permanent messing up the brush</li>
    <li> I was really surprised how poor of quality these are since I&#x27;ve purchased several nail art tools on Amazon and even at a ridiculous low price, they have always been great quality.  The bristles of these brushes are uneven and shed easily.  I had to trim them a bit because there was one or two stray hairs that caused lines to look really sloppy.  All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.  I purchased these because I only have a few nail stripers and wanted to be able to create lines with any color versus being limited to the colors of nail stripers I own.  I would recommend either finding better brushes or sticking to the nail striper bottles.</li>
    <li> This is a cool product. You get three different size brushes to create fun and super creative designs on nails. I would recommend this product to older teens and adults.</li>
    <li> I have receive my items. I want to say thank you and Yes i would recommend these brushes to a friend.</li>
    <li> These are not bad at all for the $$$. About the only quibble I can think of is that I&#x27;m not crazy about the handles. They&#x27;re a bit flimsy, but the brushes themselves are excellent for detail and for what I paid for them I can&#x27;t complain. They took a little while to get here but it wasn&#x27;t too long and I think I would order these again...</li>
    <li> Not only did my order arrive nearly 30 days late it arrived damaged, broken, torn packaging that had been taped back together and looks nothing like the picture. Its a scam!! Do not fall in to the trap. they are horrible products and not worth it. The only reason i didn&#x27;t return my item was due to the simple fact they cost so little. But i guess you get what you pay for. But if i were you spend the extra money and get something that is acutally worth buying. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Brushes suck. The bristles come off and it doesn&#x27;t give you the control you need to make designs &amp; when you use it the nail paint looks thin &amp; you can see the strokes. Good for applying glitter polish though. Really cheap too so I didn&#x27;t expect it to be amazing.</li>
    <li> Looked good at first but the metal parts connecting the brush to the stick were very loose causing the brush to fall apart. One brush fell into the paint -_- Since I don&#x27;t want to go through the whole returning something  and possibly getting another crappy product thing I&#x27;ll probably just use nail glue to glue it together. Hopefully that works.</li>
    <li> Such a bad quality but that&#x27;s expected with the price. Never again will I get fooled by sale prices. Not a product I would recommend even to a beginner nail artist.</li>
    <li> Great  product !  !  !  !  !  Fast shipping too!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE GOODS QUALITY</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay having problems with the brush it seems to fall off so I super glued it and now it works great</li>
    <li> Nice brushes but arrived late. But the bristles are very good.</li>
    <li> These were very cheap brushes, once dipped in acetone, or nail polish remover, the black pain comes off, as well as the little brush hairs.</li>
    <li> Poor construction and took MONTHS to come in the mail!</li>
    <li> They are great brushes, but. One of my tips came off in the packet</li>
    <li> Of course these brushes are NOT SABLE. They work ok for a spell then they get all &amp;#34;frizzed out&amp;#34; and useless. For the price they&#x27;re ok but as working brushes they rate zero.</li>
    <li> Keep clean or you will screw the brush up</li>
    <li> I have used this set alot..</li>
    <li> Great tools for the price.</li>
    <li> The brushes themselves are okay, but they (the entire metal tip on each brush) are very loose, and fall off very easily.</li>
    <li> Perfect for using in detailed eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Well for the price they are good</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I expected to see these nice tiny brushes that look great for using with nails but the brushes are a little bit longer making them less easier to use. They are still usable and work pretty good but I still expected what was shown and the brushes I got aren&#x27;t that small of a tip. The tip of the smallest brush is ------------ that long. I just put the brush up to the screen to measure. But since they work decently I gave it 4 stars</li>
    <li> great brushes! makes nail art so much easier and a lot more fun1</li>
    <li> My sister in law purchest these for me. I use them for all my nail art designs i love them. i wish there was 2 smaller brushes instead of the one small and the very large one... but other than that they are great</li>
    <li> love these, your  able to write and design on your nails ,i have medium size nails and was able to make it work so happy i love doing my own nails and its the best</li>
    <li> I love them sooooo much! I got these nail brushes for 82¢ and I thought they would be crappy for the price. they ended up being really good brushes plus they came abkut a month before they were supposed to!!!</li>
    <li> I love these. I do my finger nails daily to match either my mood or clothing i am wearing. I get many compliments when ii use these to give my nails a little extra detail. Very easy to use . I would recommend to anyone that loves doing fun things with their nails.</li>
    <li> The brushes work fine except when the metal tip came off of the black part of the handle. I was in the middle of practicing on my friends nails when it just fell off! It would have been embarrasing if I were to have purchased these for a more professional use.. Nevertheless I had some super glue handy and I was able to glue the tip back on.</li>
    <li> I ignored the others comment, because this was very cheap and I thought I&#x27;d still try it anyway, but if you&#x27;re looking for a really thin brush to make designs this is not it. The quality however is not bad.</li>
    <li> Yes, they just came. Just in time for christmas nail art. I like the sizes and they seem to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> My manicurist loves these brushes when she hand paints designs on my nails. They are perfect for controlling the size of the strokes.</li>
    <li> They do what they are made for but if you watch nail art videos and want to do a really cool design, you have to have the skills not just the tools if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> Tips with the brushes come off,  not a huge deal..  I glued them back on...  But the brushes are not good for nail art at all...  Get what you pay for, huh?</li>
    <li> As long as you clean them, they&#x27;ll stay in good shape. They were larger than expected, but still worked wonderfully. Highly recommend. Also shipping took a while but oh well.</li>
    <li> When these brushes came in they where already broken. They are very poor quality, wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to any one else</li>
    <li> They came all stuck together like one piece of wood at the bottom you break them each away from each other so they look really shotty because of that. Also the tip slid right off one of them which I had to glue back on. Over all they still get the job done, it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> I brought these to help with designs on my nails, it came quick, brand new, so I have not one complaint&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest anyone needing nail art brushes, buy these and it&#x27;s at a great price fast shipping,  you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one</li>
    <li> All I can say is I was very disappointed in what I received. First 2 of them were broken the tips were folded and made it impossible to work with. All I can say is you really get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only given 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet. They look like good quality and they seem like they&#x27;ll be easy to use. I like that they arrived faster than I thought. I&#x27;m just starting out doing my own nails so it&#x27;s very important for me to have comfort of use. I recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> was exactly what i was looking for.  Didn&#x27;t want to spend tons of money on my own personal hobby.  Price was excellent. would buy from again.</li>
    <li> the brush itself is decent however cleaning out the brush is a mess. tried wiping it with acetone nail polish remover and the color of the wood as metal totally peeled off. i mean it is a cheap product after all.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brushes are very shallow making it very hard to make any kind of design. The lines are very flat not precise. These are not good for any type of nail art but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The metal ends come right off on all of the ones I received. I used nail glue to keep them on, they work well now.</li>
    <li> These paint brushes worked very well because I could paint on some very cute designs on my toe nails. My ending result was very cute painted toes that looked like I came out of the nail shop. I didn&#x27;t spend lots of money on this product so it unbelievable how happy I am with my results!!!</li>
    <li> If you love DIY nail art these are a great deal!! Very easy to use and make very precise designs</li>
    <li> Makes drawing that much easier and more precise!</li>
    <li> I have used this to creat designs on my nails after they have been painted and they work great, also are easy to clean</li>
    <li> Great for detai! I also use the for acrylic art.</li>
    <li> The metal falls off the wood when you clean them.</li>
    <li> its cheap and a bad quality. The metal part instantly comes off and after using it just becomes sloppy. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> Very well made for medium size designs</li>
    <li> Metal tip fell off first time used</li>
    <li> I could have bought these cheaper at the craft store. Not really worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> Eh, it&#x27;s ok, the brushes are longer than I expected! Not like the picture.</li>
    <li> Not good brushes at all. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The wood is cheap and one of them the metal parts broke off with the wood stuck inside. The paint on the wood is crap and comes off easily. way not worth it and if I would of known they were crap would of never bought them by what I do know is I&#x27;m not spending $4-$5 to buy another set. Forget that!</li>
    <li> one of them fell apart on the first day but other than that, it wasnt that bad but if youre looking for something, like, super top grade, keep in mind that you get what you pay for, this is great for beginners</li>
    <li> When I got them two were broken and could not be fixed</li>
    <li> For less than 2 bucks I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price. When it arrived however all three of the brushes were broken. I emailed them asking them if they would replace them but they never got back to me. For the $2 I just ordered them again. I&#x27;m hoping they will arrive in one piece this time. I have used them (I just taped them back together) and they&#x27;re not my favorite for nail art, but they&#x27;re alright. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the gamble for the 2 bucks. I will update this review when my new set arrives.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE!!!! Literally one of the worst $2 ever spent. So, I just them in the mail, all excited and guess what they&#x27;re plastic?!! The tips are very bendable and the nail polish is very hard to get off. It stays stuck on there. Hopefully World Pride will give me a refund.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes today. They are wonderful! Really nice . I am a happy customer! I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Ordered these well before Christmas... Just delivered 2nd week in January.</li>
    <li> Got my brushes in the mail finally and they look like crap, The bristles look nothing like the picture they are all the same and completely ragged. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have not tried them with polish or acrylic paint yet but I tested the strokes on my finger and they seem to be able to detail like i need them to on my nails. I will be testing them later today and posting an update then. They arrived 2 weeks early so yay!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought the brushes did everything I wanted them to do. Tons of control since the brush is short and skinny. Only complaint is that they are pretty lightweight as if they could fall apart easily. Good thing they were inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Its hard to make any nail art with these because they are so thick</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> Maybe its just me but I struggle to use these.</li>
    <li> They arrived pretty fast and are very useful.  The points a clean with no extra hairs sticking out that could cause me to mess up when using them. I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> These nailbrushes are not good quality. The bristles don&#x27;t apply the paint smoothly, the silver part where the bristle head attaches to wood handle came off and I had to use wood glue to reattach. The black paint on handle will come off and create a mess if it comes into contact with acetone. I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> awesome may have to reglue tips&#x3D;&#x3D;big whoop the brushes are fabulous to me!!</li>
    <li> Brushes are cheap and dont glide the nail polish smoothly</li>
    <li> Bought these four my sister and she loved them</li>
    <li> As expected, thin scarp, love them</li>
    <li> I have not used them yet but from what I see in the package it&#x27;s what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I got my brushes over a week before the earliest estimated delivery date. They were well packaged in an envelope and wrapped in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were sturdy, I saw a lot of complaints about the metal part falling out, I had no issues with this. Only issue I had was that I had to trim a few uneven bristles, this is where I took the star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I  am very happy with this. I did use the smallest brush and it is fantastic for fine nail art. For less than $2, including shipping, you really shouldn&#x27;t pass these up.</li>
    <li> because I have yet to receive the brushes!  It&#x27;s been a month and frankly I&#x27;m to the point where I forgot about them!  I suppose they could be nice if and when I get them...</li>
    <li> VERY USEFUL, RINSES WELL, DETAIL IS GOOD. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. PERFECT FOR NAIL OR MAKEUP ART. PRICE IS GOOD</li>
    <li> these suck so bad they are so hard and stiff so it messes up your polish when you try to do the nail art the only thing i use these for are picking up diamonds. oh yea 2 of them broke before i even had a chance to use them!</li>
    <li> These do what they are supposed to do, but all of them broke as soon as I used them.  The silver part which has the brush attached to it is just a &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; and on all 3 brushes, this cap came off.  It&#x27;s easy to fix, you can just slide it back on and maybe use some glue too.  It was just annoying.</li>
    <li> I wish I bought a nail striper too because I didn&#x27;t see it well that it doesn&#x27;t include it. But I will purchase more next time.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes. Just like the pic shows. Shipped quickly and I&#x27;m happy with the size and durability. Don&#x27;t think you can do better anywhere else.</li>
    <li> The brushes SEEM okay so far, and I was able to paint with them, but when I cleaned them with nail polish remover the paint came off the handles.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes fell apart as soon as I took it out of the packaging. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved these brushes!. They came in great condition although the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that they came in 3weeks but they came ! :) they are very easy to work with and they work really great!. They make nail designs so much easier I would Recomend people to buy from this seller !.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes came broken, I am so sad, but the others work perfect, this tool work for little details in your nails.</li>
    <li> Came fast and in great condition! Loved the kit each brush is different and well made I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great for doing small jobs like your nails and doll faces.  they just take awhile to get to you.  But if you are not in a hurry this is the way to go. cheap.</li>
    <li> When the product arrived, they didn&#x27;t work at all. The brush was rubbery and flimsy, and split in the middle so it created two uneven lines. Horrible. It also broke easily after one tiny pull. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> for the price i really cant complain the brushes arrived in 2 weeks in great condition ..but its a very soft brush so my lines come out wide and fat</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for 1.36 + free shipping, I waited a few weeks for delivery. Considering the price, theres no way to be unsatisfied with the product no matter what happens to them, honestly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these brushes to do fine line work on nail art using gelish polish and regular opi polish. I clean them in acetone with no problem. I have noticed them becoming a bit fluffy with use but a fluffy brush works excellent for picking up and placing glitter so all in all Im most likely going to invest in another couple sets.</li>
    <li> I have bought many nail brushes and nail brush sets in the past and none have been as good quality or even as sweetly priced as these.  Its a great buy.</li>
    <li> The brushes are not bad ( I paid less than 2 bucks, so there&#x27;s no way ) the sizes are great, the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was, they were fanned out, but I tried to fix them, how?? well with an x-acto knife I cut the hairs that were out of place , and now they work awesome, I like the long handle too, so I will definitely  buy them again if I need to :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I loved the smallest brush for all the detail work on anything I&#x27;m doing. Shipping was fast and the price is great. I will be purchasing these brushes again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the nail designs or anything amall. I bought two packs of them. Everything is so much easier now that i have these smaller brushes</li>
    <li> i just got my brushes very cute and nice sized handle. they came in great condition however the metal bristle holder detached from the handle on one of them but i think that happened in transit. bristles on the brushes are in great shape and have great tension to provide nice designs and strong strokes while painting. i can&#x27;t wait to use them... &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Brushes took about 2 weeks to get here. Still earlier than the estimated arrival date. They work great. i&#x27;m happy about my purchase.</li>
    <li> It does what it needs to do. Easy to handle and good for the nail artists out there. I just did a few unique designs!</li>
    <li> The tips (the silver part) will fall off if not very careful, but easy to glue back on. Works well for nail art.</li>
    <li> A little bigger than I thought they would be.  The handle being larger makes it easier to work with.  They&#x27;re just ok, not great</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses these with ink and they work just fine. Nothing special but for the price asked they are really good.</li>
    <li> These brushes are just right for the art my wife does on her nails</li>
    <li> They suit the purpose.</li>
    <li> Happy I got these for when I put designs on my nails its a lot easier and I have more control with this nail tool plus they look just how they do in the picture so it wasn&#x27;t no false advertising</li>
    <li> Brush is very hard tried to do designs but didn&#x27;t work out for me, also it breaks very easily  I gripped it nd it broke I. My first night trying it out .</li>
    <li> These Brushes Suck. I had polish nail removal on my hand and grabbed the black part of the brush and the brush stuck to me. It was a Big Mess.&lt;br /&gt;And on top of that they took two months to get here.</li>
    <li> I cant get them to grab the nail polish. maybe im not using them right</li>
    <li> These were alright, I was expecting them to be a little better quality but I don&#x27;t know why I thought that for spending less that $2 on them. The bristles almost all look the same size even though they are supposed to be different sizes. The are alright not the best quality but not horrendous either.</li>
    <li> nice, works well for nails</li>
    <li> I like this product but when I got them I had to trim some of the brushes because the length was not right.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive these brushes, so much in fact i decided to do a fill in just so that I could use them,  To my dismay, they were horrible.  I will stick to my older yet reliable brushes from now on!!!</li>
    <li> They get the job done. If only I can master it.</li>
    <li> i finally used them. I colored in a bow on a Minnie mouse head. it worked great! I hope I am cleaning the brush&#x27;s right. I am using nail polish remover. anyone know if that&#x27;s right?</li>
    <li> The hairs on all the brushes were pretty bent up and difficult to work with; if you&#x27;re going to start doing your nails regularly, I would suggest in investing in something of a little better quality.</li>
    <li> I recommend these brushes because they were good for the price.  They get the job done just like the more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush is not stiff enough to do a decent design. I do better with the long skinny ones that come with the polish...</li>
    <li> these brushe are good for any detailing..  even for ceramic to nails.. they hold up very well..... the even work on making cards.. like this ALOT..</li>
    <li> My 4 yr. old granddaughter uses these brushes to pain with!&lt;br /&gt;They help her paint the areas which are very narrow and they hold the paint so well.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find these for her since I was giving her my makeup brushes. The brush that comes with the kit just makes a mess!&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend you order these brushes. You will be glad you did..!</li>
    <li> I got these because the price was low but so is the quality. They don&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped and one of the ferrules fell off of one of the brushes the first time I used it. Since they didn&#x27;t cost much I didn&#x27;t look into replacing it.</li>
    <li> Not totally bad. You get what you paid for. As soon as I took them out of the package, the tip started to fall off of all three. I just had to super glue them back on. Not the best but they are ok.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how soon i received the brushes.  Happy with the product. I&#x27;m sure my niece will love them as they are part of her xmas gift.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Great stocking stuffer.  My daughter will love them!  Thanks for the great deal! I can&#x27;t wait for Christmas to give them to her!</li>
    <li> Great tools, used them frequently and I have never had problems with . Great quality as well I love them</li>
    <li> Little brushes for the price. I am using 2 for my paint in ceramics class and one for eye liner....will order more for sure.</li>
    <li> Good. Nice. Okay. Alright. As expected. In one piece. Nifty. Shiny. A-ok. Acceptable. Satisfactory. Valuable. Favorable. Neat. Pleasant. Agreeable. Commendable.</li>
    <li> They are okay but when i try to do designs they don&#x27;t work well. Also one of the brushes came broken i had to glue top part back on but it just kept falling off.</li>
    <li> Product was just as stated in the ad. I would purchase again if needed. The items met my expectations completely</li>
    <li> Great price, great product! Would buy again if needed. Shorted bristle for much better control! Great buy! Thank you again</li>
    <li> I purchased these to do my nails, but my boyfriend took them over for use on model car painting!  He loves them!  I will buy more for me!</li>
    <li> Shipping took a little long. Received items. All pieces were there. Price was excellent. Brushes seem to be quality brushes. Haven&#x27;t seen bristles falling out.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described- good value.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my teenage daughter as a Christmas gift.  She liked them and says they are neat.  The different sizes should be helpful when painting her nails.</li>
    <li> The bristles of these brushes are too small for the thickness of nail polish. I couldn&#x27;t do any neat lines with these at all! Very disappointed. But then again, they were pretty cheap!</li>
    <li> Good value for the money, but nothing to shout about, I did have to trim the brushes for my detailed nail are, but pretty much, all of us have to do that to almost all brushes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of art brushes for cake decorating and they are fantastic for painting small details on cakes.</li>
    <li> These are really useful. They differ in size which is great. They get a precise line and are just really nice and handy.</li>
    <li> Silver tips came off on the first use.  That&#x27;s what I get for going cheep.  Really not worth the price,.</li>
    <li> They work excellent for the detail that is needed when I am doing my nail art. I am glad and purchased these and for the price it was a win win!</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE GRRREAT... THEY GIVE &amp; HELP THE (NON) PROFESSIONAL. LIKE MYSELF... ANOTHER... NAIL LOVERS, NAIL ART *MUST* HAVE*.. THANX &amp; GOD BLESS :D :D</li>
    <li> One of them broke and I wasn&#x27;t even using it.  Like, that would be cool if it was some sort of magic trick - look at me break something that is just sitting there! Wow! Amazing! But less cool when you&#x27;re just trying to do some freakin&#x27; nail art.  The brushes themselves aren&#x27;t so bad but it&#x27;s annoying to have to glue something back together that you&#x27;ve actually never used. Just take my advice and skip the nail art all together - there&#x27;s a reason why you&#x27;re not a professional nail artist. You&#x27;re not good at it. Trust.</li>
    <li> the paint on the blushes come off to easy like they just did them no buenoo but everything else they were good</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t order, not good quality. They fell apart on the first use. This is not a good product, very unhappy with product.</li>
    <li> The bristles were of a good quality! They came in bubble wrap and were not broken or damaged at all. The brushes were light and felt good in my hand. there was also a plastic sleeve on the top of each of the brushes to protect the bristles. Overall it was a good product.</li>
    <li> Everything that I wanted was what I got. The description was perfect and the picture is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great set for both beginners and advanced. A small amount goes a long way with these brushes. Arrived quickly. Handles for well in hand easy to hold as well.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when these came in the mail.  They were cost effective, easy to handle and worth the wait.  I would recommend these to any level nail artist.</li>
    <li> They have not performed very well with glitters (not surprising), but have done well otherwise.  Part is not being sure it&#x27;s not just me (as I&#x27;m still learning how to use brushes with nail polish, not just acrylics), or if it&#x27;s the brushes as it&#x27;s not always as bold of lines drawn as I would like.  Still, a good value, and I ended up getting an extra set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so cheaply made, its so sad, I mean they are pretty cheap, the paint on them smells so bad it makes me sick (and Im not sensitive to smells) one came broken, one broke when I tried to take the plastic cover off. No I would not consider this a good buy.</li>
    <li> I love this tool just because it gives me the ability to do good art work Good iteam i reccomend although the silver connceted to thebrush feel off on one of them</li>
    <li> Could be a bit finer point and the bulk of the brush is a bit annoying but they work well and are good quality bristles not the cheap crappy ones that don&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> They look exactly the same as the picture.  They&#x27;re soft. The only complaint i have is the metal separated from the wood on one of the brushes. But i just applied a little glue and good as new.</li>
    <li> I actually got these for my mom, and they certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint. That&#x27;s about all I got to say though because I don&#x27;t really get those for me lol.</li>
    <li> it works great at nail art i have an easy way to do art now on nails thanks for thid</li>
    <li> Love this so easyy to use! its a must for designs ... my work it comin out awsome. hoping they last a while</li>
    <li> These are simply the best set of brushes for nail art. The price is extremely affordable and they seem to be lasting very well.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected I can&#x27;t seem to get the nail polish to stick on the brush but I can&#x27;t complain to much for the price</li>
    <li> Well packaged shipped relatively quickly. I was hesitant to purchase with all the reviews saying they were broken.... All 3 of my sets arrived prefect. The 3 sizes in each set allows perfect thin controlled nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
    <li> Not too bad for the price, the tip of the brush was a little bent, but water will Fix that. Overall pretty good.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for nail art lovers! The are shipped nicely and arrived on time giving. I would definitely recommend it to nail art lovers!</li>
    <li> Since the estimated delivery time for this set of brushes was &amp;#34;by March 27th&amp;#34;, I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived quickly.  I too, ordered these not for nail art but to use as eyeliner brushes and so far so good - been using it for about a week now with both liquid and gel liners, it provided a nice clean line each time and held up well in cleaning.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical of buying this because of all the bad reviews and people saying that it got brittle and broke, but I cleaned mine after every use and haven&#x27;t had any problems. :)</li>
    <li> It work for the School project just what I needed is not too expensive it just the right price !</li>
    <li> Love these brushes so far! They&#x27;re a little bigger than expected by the picture but still workable without cutting them smaller as long as you play and learn how to use them :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a star away though because they have a really strong smell to them. They smell like cheap plastic-y things that you get from the dollar store (Yeah I know they ARE cheap but some things that are cheap are better quality)  So if it weren&#x27;t for the smell i would have gave 5 stars. They still smell a week after recieving them and using them a couple times with acetone, washing them with soap, letting them set out to air out, nothing is getting rid of the smell. BUT if you can deal with that these are decent brushes.</li>
    <li> There brushes what can I say, but they are not like this picture. 1 is tiny like these but the others are a little bigger than the picture but they do work like there suppose to and I haven&#x27;t had any fall out. I use them on my nails and one on my eyeliner and they work the way there suppose to. I actually was happy that a couple were bigger for my eyeliner and it does work good for that.. Over all I am happy but wish on at least one the bristles were a little tougher or didn&#x27;t bend so much.</li>
    <li> The product arrived faster than the estimated time. I have started  using the brushes and the bristles are pretty good quality. However, I&#x27;m not using them for nails, I am using them for a painting I am doing.</li>
    <li> They came broken.. That&#x27;s all I have to say</li>
    <li> easy to use brushes. i drew feathers and flowers with mine. they did not clean easily but other than that i recomend.</li>
    <li> I purchased theses brushes expecting to do artwork on my fingernails. The brushes are small but not small enough for my taste.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I just threw them away after I opened the package.</li>
    <li> i am a nail tecnitian and i recomend this art brushes because they are easy to use, and the hair dont come out when they get in contact with the acetone</li>
    <li> upon receiving my products the tip broke. no good. I would not buy again. no no no no no no</li>
    <li> ok so the brushes are alright but the reason i gave them two stars was because when I opened the package one of the brushes metal pieces that connects to the black park was broken.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other brushes before so I can&#x27;t compare these to others, but so far so good. :D</li>
    <li> Hi I got this product yesterday and oh my god i used it and it works awesome i really recommend this product to everyone i use this to do nail art designs that are hard to do with a regular brush but this worked very well thank you</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like these the brush was cheap and didn&#x27;t have a fine point</li>
    <li> some reviews say these came broken. they didn&#x27;t come broken. they came just as i wanted. when i tried them out i liked them, but when you want to make a really perfect circle or anything with a curve, i don&#x27;t suggest these because the brush is too long. but otherwise these are great for a nice price</li>
    <li> Brushes did not have good quality</li>
    <li> There were barley any bristles to paint with</li>
    <li> Poorly put together.. Spastic frizzy plastic pieces glued to a cheap plastic handle!</li>
    <li> Cheap (of course). Two of the three - the top silver and brush was separated from the wooden handle. worthless</li>
    <li> Easy to use and draw. If you want to do designs on your nails then this is the thing to get. The brushes are soft and goes across the nail smoothly.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes, but the brush does come apart from the handle. No big deal, I added some nail glue in the hole and connected them back together and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since. I cut two of them down to my desired bristle amount and now they are apart of my commonly used nail brush army!</li>
    <li> Got it very soon, totally pleased. &amp; it came with the cutest little butterfly. Very satisfied, the brushes are perfect. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> These were just what I needed for fine lines with control. These brushes have thick handles making them easier to hold onto.</li>
    <li> The paint brushes are as pictured but it&#x27;s hard to tell exactly how fat the handle is.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles of smallest brush came in covered in glue. This turned them into an unusable bent hard pointy bit.&lt;br /&gt;Not useable for painting on anything.&lt;br /&gt;I will try using acetone to remove the glue but not sure if that will cause the bristles to fallout.&lt;br /&gt;Should have spent a bit more and gotten nice brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> they are very helpful with my design. Their easy to use even for people like me which are beginners,you guys should try it</li>
    <li> These are great with the small brush to make really cool designs  with paint and nail polish art wortk on my nails.</li>
    <li> They look really professional and I hope they do a really good job. I hope that my designs come out wonderful.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Just as described.</li>
    <li> I liked these because they were super cheap! And yes they are cheap! The bristles fall out and the metal part that holds the bristles falls off of the stick.</li>
    <li> They broke the first time i used them! Plus they didnt work as well as i wanted them to. I wouls never get these again, I got a better brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great nail tool! I love it. It&#x27;s good for nail polish lovers. It&#x27;s great for painting small things! Must have it!!!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re easy to hold the brush works perfect.The three dufferent sizes nake nail art a little easier. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The handle will be faded when contact with acetone. The brush tip is cheaply made, it fall apart after a few uses.</li>
    <li> The brushes are well worth the price of about $2 and they make nail art detailing so easy! I love the brushes!</li>
    <li> Arrived intact. Nice product, the hairs don&#x27;t all fall out of the brushes. Shipping takes FOREVER though. only buy if you have time to lose</li>
    <li> I have used these nail brushes twice, and so far so good...definetly need to learn how to Maurer them as to not get much of the nail polish on, other than that, great!</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-very easy to clean (just use nail polish remover. NOT acetone)&lt;br /&gt;-nice quality&lt;br /&gt;-the different sizes make it easy to do the details i need&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the tips are not secured onto the wood. they can pop off pretty easily. just required a bit of glue to fix. not a huge issue since i only paid a dollar for them....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these are very handy and easy to use. And for a dollar, they are well worth it.</li>
    <li> The head fall off when received but that fine not really a big issue!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Thank you</li>
    <li> Work great but have a weird smell coming from them. Chemical smell. Weird</li>
    <li> Love these thin short brushes great for making designs!</li>
    <li> very nice set and great price</li>
    <li> If I could give this product less then one star I would it was cheap cheap do not buy</li>
    <li> I got my brushes way ahead of delivery time and i enjoy using them.</li>
    <li> Was leary when I saw the brushes had thicker handles than expected, turns out they really help keeping your hand steady for finer details. Love em!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Quality product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> the silver ends keep coming off. cheaply made</li>
    <li> cheep the paint runs if it gets to hot</li>
    <li> just got this in today made first design with these  brushes and came out perfect, thank you</li>
    <li> The only problem with this brush set was that the brushes fell apart. You will probably have to glue them to keep them together. I was still able to use them and they were alright. But you get what you pay for. I was able to paint using these brushes and my project came out alright with them. I was just disappointed that they fell apart.</li>
    <li> Great product,  item was delivered as described.</li>
    <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t give you a good indication of how small the bristles are. They aren&#x27;t as small as you&#x27;d expect. If you&#x27;re looking for fine nail art brushes then these aren&#x27;t for you, they are easy to cut to size though. I really like the large metal tip. It gives me more room to work with acetone without the worry of damaging the wood handle.</li>
    <li> When the brushes arrived, one of the metal parts fell off of the wooden handle within the first day. I hadn&#x27;t even had a chance to use them! Eventually the other two fell off as well,  after only using them a couple of times. The price is,  just about, the only good aspect. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Came on time their more bigger than what I had expected it but over all their nice and do a well done job.</li>
    <li> The brushes worked great after I glued all the silver tips back on. I had to use super glue. They all just fell off, I don&#x27;t know if they got glued on to start with. But they are very cheap so get them, but have some glue handy!!!</li>
    <li> This are pretty good happy with the buy.. just had to crazy glue the brush back one the silver part would come off but once I glued it one they haven&#x27;t come off good buy and price is also good</li>
    <li> Very cheap quality brushes. The bristles and metal attachment fell off the handle of one of them as I was opening the package. For such a low price, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t expect any better, but if you are looking for actually usable brushes, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started getting into nail art and every little trick I can use to help my designs look more nail salon quality than 5 year old artist quality just makes it better. These really are perfect. They were really affordable, they&#x27;re easy to use and clean. They did take quite a while to receive them from China (or Hong Kong, I can&#x27;t remember) but I kind of expected that so it wasn&#x27;t the end of the world. Since they take so long to get to you would recommend just ordering them if you are on the fence about them. They are totally worth the wait and the price!</li>
    <li> These obviously aren&#x27;t the most professional brushes in the world, but for the price they are fabulous.  The tips are so thin that any design is possible.</li>
    <li> The actual bristles are larger (width wise) than I would like for doing nail art. I will probably trim them in a little bit.</li>
    <li> i know its really cheap but the tip of it falls quickly other than that its ok thanks for reading</li>
    <li> If you can only get one set of brushes, get these. They are the thinnest I&#x27;ve seen, which allows you to make those beautifully intricate details on your nails. It&#x27;s a really good deal for three quality brushes. The black handles have a pleasant smooth, black texture. I clean them by swishing them around in acetone or nail polish remover. I&#x27;ve had them for a couple of months and they are holding up pretty well. Get them.</li>
    <li> Excellent &amp;#34;sable&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
    <li> i got this product and it was broken. now Im  stock with this item that I can use! i will trye to glue it i guess</li>
    <li> These brushes are terrible. I bought them specifically because I hoped that \\&quot;nail art brushes\\&quot; would hold up better to acetone than normal art brushes--but the moment I dipped them into the acetone to clean them the paint began to slough from the handles! Additionally, the ferrules are not clamped on like they should be, just attached with a bit of glue, and as soon as the paint began to come off the ferrules &amp; bristles became loose as well. All of this exposed the cheapness of the wood the handle is made of. I&#x27;m going to stick with proper art brushes from now on. :/</li>
    <li> It was ok but as soon as I got my brushes one of them popped off it&#x27;s stick I was sad and kinda mad</li>
    <li> i guess they&#x27;re ok.  im no pro though  lol</li>
    <li> i ordered these brushes and they are CRAP! DO NOT BUY THEM.</li>
    <li> Works great to to create nail designs! The smallest size is very useful for creating fine details.</li>
    <li> Well 2 of the three work well, the other the brush and medal part separated from the wood on the first day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional in terms using beauty items but I can say this product is really good. They&#x27;re inexpensive but they have excellent quality and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I think I was expecting a better quality brush instead the brushes that I received had thin bristles, they don&#x27;t remove polish well, and they mess up my polish application. I ended up purchasing a different set of brushes to find what theses were lacking.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes for nail art. They really help with detailing nail art and very easy to use every time.</li>
    <li> I received them earlier than they told me (that was great). For the price the quality is acceptable.  I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been looking  for brushes like these I&#x27;m excited to try them out ill see how it goes :)</li>
    <li> I actually just got them today and used them. They were easy and made painting my nails way more easy.</li>
    <li> I suck at nail art, but these brushes have helped slightly. Worth it.</li>
    <li> After nearly waiting a month for these brushes i honestly didn&#x27;t want them anymore. When i did get them however i opened them up from the packaging and looked at them. My first impression by just looking at them was wow okay these aren&#x27;t bad for what i paid for. I opened them up from the plastic and this awful paint toxic smell started to appear...I was shocked because these were cheaply made. I washed them and let them soak for a while but the smell was still there. The paint started to peel off as soon as i was drying them. Overall this wasn&#x27;t so pleasing. Save your money and invest in something that&#x27;s actually good quality.</li>
    <li> Good, but the color came off</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these brushes.</li>
    <li> Prom is only a few months away and this is what I needed. I&#x27;m not going to the nail salon and pay $25 for it to not last that long. It cleaned off easily with nail polish remover. It doesn&#x27;t slip out your hands easily. I love using the detail brush out of the other two. This was my first time that I ever used nail brushes. But eventually i&#x27;ll be able to do it professionaly.</li>
    <li> These things broke right away, making them completely useless. I dipped them in nail polish and tried to paint designs, but the top silver part just snapped off.</li>
    <li> These brushes are just the right size. My daughter is very happy with her designed toes now that mommy can make her pretty flowers!</li>
    <li> not only did my shipping date get moved further and further back - it took a month and a half to get these brushes! when they did arrive, they were in horrible shape. one was uncovered and the brush was smashed as well as the handle. I will never order from them again. highly disappointed</li>
    <li> Will not purchase again. Brush tips are poor and the metal and wooden handle separated within the first week of using. And that&#x27;s barely using it!</li>
    <li> The brushes are good quality, the paint comes with a strong scent. The paint on the brushes comes off very easily. Which kind of sucks.</li>
    <li> Fell apart as soon as I got them!</li>
    <li> When I first got them, I was excited to try them out! But before i even got to use them, the tips broke off, leaving me with just the handle! I then went to try one out and found that the bristles got really clumped together when they were used, and it was really tough to wash them. Even though the price is low, the quality is terrible, not worth it!</li>
    <li> Good Nail art brushes, the paint does come off easily but thats not a big problem , the brushes in general are wonderful and the shipment was really fast!</li>
    <li> Smells interesting. Noticeable oder when opened the package.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the tips and how small they were which is what I wanted but the silver part that connects the brush to the wood comes off very easily.</li>
    <li> Bought a few accessories to go with this and my niece seemed to like them and for the price you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes broke almost immediately after opening the package. The bristles also seem to fan out a bit, making it really difficult to paint designs. I may just not know what I&#x27;m doing, but they just don&#x27;t seem very great.</li>
    <li> the brushes arrived on time but they were all broken very dissappointed next time i will read reviews and check it out.  no i would not recommend these, they are not well made if so many arrive broken huh!</li>
    <li> exactally what it shows and they came in good time no problems at all love them great great great! thanks</li>
    <li> Very excited to use my new nail brushes for my art. Arrived on time, look great. Hopefully they last a while.</li>
    <li> These nail art brushes are great!  Great for detailing and drawing, although I&#x27;m really not an experience artist.  Great tools for nail art collections.</li>
    <li> This item works perfectly with my nail polish &amp; makes it look really stunning!  It is also thin enough so that your nails won&#x27;t get messed up!  I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Very cheap material came broken in the delivery package.</li>
    <li> finally came. 2-3 days ago. They are exactly like the picture.</li>
    <li> Took 5 weeks to arrive and was cheaply,made and not useful.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes for my nail decoration , they are great! doing a perfect job</li>
    <li> These were nice, one came broken, but was easily fixed with glue. I found it hard to clean them. But all in all they was okay.</li>
    <li> Fell apart. Can&#x27;t clean very well either</li>
    <li> They are soft and work well</li>
    <li> One had bent bristles. The others were great.</li>
    <li> fast shipping i love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to do more detailed designs and I am very happy with what I received. The brushes feel light but they don&#x27;t feel flimsy.</li>
    <li> Product came finally but understandable because it came from such a long way but very happy with product 4 stars only due to the time it took for item to come</li>
    <li> great price and like how small the hair is&lt;br /&gt;i like how the metal is long so it wont damage as much if left in  water&lt;br /&gt;and they are longer then appear in the photo a bit longer then the average size pencil</li>
    <li> Not a lot to say about this, just that it serves a purpose and nothing more...I can&#x27;t complain, it&#x27;s okay!</li>
    <li> Pretty good brushes for detailing...The longer handle makes maneuvering them a little easier...Cheaper than buying them at a department store</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived on time, brushes are nothing special but fairly typical and worth the money.</li>
    <li> geat item i love the material</li>
    <li> Love them, very easy to use</li>
    <li> Cheap! Brush part falls right off of the wood.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good for their price, theyre not the highest quality, but they get the job done. I wouldnt recommend them for intricate and delicate nail work, but for all your basic needs and designs they are cool.</li>
    <li> Used Them For First Time And One Of The Brushes Broke !</li>
    <li> These fell apart quickly and for the low price are Very Low QUALITY.&lt;br /&gt;I do not Recomend.&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> They work and that&#x27;s what matters right? I wish the color on the handle didn&#x27;t come off. That was kinda a pain.</li>
    <li> was looking for sable application brushes.  when I see sable nail brush I guess I assumed they were for applying nail sets.</li>
    <li> The brushes were perfect.  Not too soft and not too stiff.  Worked great for added touches to nail designs.  No little pieces of brush left behind.</li>
    <li> Once I used and cleaned the brushes, they were not an fine as the 1st time used.  Designs were inaccurate a sloppy.</li>
    <li> I have not use them get i need to see how to use them the nail brushes had n o instructions how to use then</li>
    <li> These brushes are exactly what I was looking for my nail art, I use them all the time!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> These brushes are a waste of time money and excitement. They are too big and don&#x27;t even make a solid line. Very cheaply made. Never going to buy again. Good thing I didn&#x27;t spend a ton.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product to have when doing nail art, it make it much easier with these brushes. Thank you..</li>
    <li> THE PICTURE SHOWS TINY BRISTLE BRUSHES AND THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU GET. THEY ARE MUCH BIGGER. SO WAS NOT HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> These are outstanding for their low price. They work very well and I&#x27;d definitely recommend these to anyone who wants high quality brushes for the lowest of low prices. They took awhile to get here but it was well worth my patience. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I HAVENT TRIED THESE BRUSHES YET, BT I WILL BE PRACTICING FIRST BEFORE I TRY THIS ON MY NAILS. THANKS FOR GETTING THIS ITEM QUICK TO ME</li>
    <li> I absolutely loooove these brushes!!!! It was very fast shipping and they are great quality! There are so many different designs you can with these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes were not as described. I was not able to do a stripe on my finger nail. They are the worst!!</li>
    <li> they look exactly as the photo. havent got a chance to use them just yet. if you like to hand design these are great back-ups</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter with a bunch of other nail stuff for Christmas. She loved it! she did her nails with al kinds for stripes and rhinestones for New Years. Great product and inexpensive. make sure to order at least a month in advance to get it on time. shipping from overseas and it took for ever to get but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> The brushes are not as small as I&#x27;d expect them to be, therefore they don&#x27;t allow very accurate lines to be made which was a dissappointment</li>
    <li> Good nail art brushes. The package came to me completely ripped open though, guess someone between China and the Pacific Northwest wanted to know what I had ordered.</li>
    <li> i loved using them. But I couldn&#x27;t ever paint my right hand! So I gave them to my brother to use to paint his LEGO&#x27;s. They work better for that!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet so I don&#x27;t know how well they will hold up but really like the way they LOOK. how they are durable but even if not the price was right. I really don&#x27;t want them for nail art so much as to use with face painting for very fine details</li>
    <li> Luv this item too now I can&#x27;t wait til my mother in law to get her nails done so I can make them look better</li>
    <li> They have sturdy handles, and tiny smooth brushes; you can do salon quality nail painting with them. Shipping took a long time.</li>
    <li> The brush useless, couldn&#x27;t do any designs with it. Big mess.&lt;br /&gt;Dont recommended it.  It was for a present to my daughter, and it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> They are okay for the price. Pretty quick delivery. The quality is not that great but I got them to practice so for now they are serving the purpose.</li>
    <li> Good for the price and i like tha long handle on them so it is easy to work with them!</li>
    <li> these brushes were STRONG in odor they smelled like spray paint threw them away after trying once and they looked  like they were previously used</li>
    <li> I have bought these brushes before and decided to get a second pair. I absolutely love these brushes, they are perfect for doing flowers on your nails. I also use them for detailing on craft projects. Will defintley be buying some more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I give this product a low rating because I thought that this would help in my nail art but so far when I have used it for making stripes on my nails, it doesn&#x27;t pick up enough product and leaves the line splotchy and uneven, maybe I need to use it a little longer but so far I&#x27;m not liking it. I&#x27;ll give it more time though. I also tried using this product to clean up messy polish lines but again didn&#x27;t work so great. I&#x27;ll have to see if I&#x27;m even using it correctly.</li>
    <li> Nice fore practice. Not professional quality but they work. I use them and bought a set for my middle school art club students who want to learn nail art designing.</li>
    <li> 1 broke opening it for the first time but amazing for the price paid so that was disappointing but its okay not the best qualtiy but still works</li>
    <li> not performing as expected, the layout is irregular. not impregnated bristle paint well, which hinders tgrazado lines and other decorations. For the price you can not demand more, I guess!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get solid lines.  I&#x27;ll work with it more but it really takes practice.  You take more on off than you put on.</li>
    <li> These brushes are EXCELLENT !! The quality of them is amazing! They can be used for eyeliner easily! I have paid 22$or more for eyeliner brushes that aren&#x27;t as good as these . It says for nail art but they are such high quality brushes there going in my make up bag &amp; ill order more for nail art. Awesome product!! Snag it before its gone!!!</li>
    <li> I was doing my nails and the brush part came off the wood part. I didn&#x27;t know it was going to last that short&lt;br /&gt; or I wouldn&#x27;t have got this at all.</li>
    <li> Bristles come apart, making lines impossible to make. Difficult to hold. All around awful product. Would not recommend. Zero stars, really.</li>
    <li> They came a week early and they were exactly what I ordered. I&#x27;m sure I could have bought tiny brushes to use for nail art at the local art store, but these were cheaper.</li>
    <li> I think these brushes helped me get more designs on ma nails n I have been getting people ask me how do I do it</li>
    <li> What I received is totally different brushes than what is in the picture. They were in cheap generic packaging and most of the numbers were worn off. There was totally no brand as shown in picture printed on the brushes, and the numbering was totally different. I also waited at least 2+ weeks to receive. Thumbs south.</li>
    <li> Okay so I got these brushes and when I tried pulling off the plastic piece the brush broke. Also when I was doing my nails the bristles seperate and go on messy. Im glad I paid so little and have no regret with my money.</li>
    <li> I use these for canvas painting on the details and smaller lines, they work great. One was broken when it came but that could have been the shippers fault. Easy glue fix.</li>
    <li> These brushes are quite amazing. Whenever I have a small area to paint, these are very handy to have, they make painting simple. Will buy again once recent ones are done.</li>
    <li> These nail brushes really don&#x27;t work all that well. They clump together and don&#x27;t paint very nicely. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> all the brushes came broken, i cant use them because the tips are broken. very disappointed. will not order again.</li>
    <li> The metal part is not glued to the wodden part. The brush bristles come with a plastic cover to protect them. On two of my brushes I had to cut this piece off because it was jammed on. I&#x27;m not even sure why it was there in the first place, the is nothing to protect. The bristles are uneven and need a lot of trimming to be considered usable. The brown paint on the handles  can&#x27;t handle any acetone/remover at all. The fumes are enough to melt the paint off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it was cheap. I didn&#x27;t expect much in terms of quality but I was surprised at jusst how low China can go. This really was such a waste of money, there are so many things you could do with a dollar that would be more useful than this, such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Buy a cheap brush set from Walmart and forget it at the store.&lt;br /&gt;2. Buy a candybar and give it to a diabetic.&lt;br /&gt;3. Pay someone a dollar for their pubic hair, tape it to a pencil, and paint with that.</li>
    <li> Feel apart really fast and were hard to paint with.</li>
    <li> I use these to do detail work on my model airplanes.  Cannot beat them for quality for the price. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> For a starter set this is really nice. They work great with the small details. For anyone needing to replace or to just get a starter set I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR NAILS OR SMALL PAINTINGS WITH PAINT,  LOVE CRAFT PRODUCTS AND THE MAKING OF THEM AND LOVE CREATING NEW DESIGNS ON NAILS AND TOES SLOW ARRIVAL</li>
    <li> Think you be fine for making art on your finger nails and toes fine art.and such not not much to say at this time</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product for painting small nail lines. It works great. A nice add to any nail basket.</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for  will make designing nails lots easier in the future thanks for offering them to the public</li>
    <li> The tops were not glued propperly(will come off) and the glue that was used has a terriable oder, I will re-glue them but you may want to buy a more quality brush and not waist your time and money.</li>
    <li> I got the brushes a week ago, just today took them out to use and the top of the brush fell off...It is an easy fix,</li>
    <li> The hair used for these brushes weren&#x27;t the best quality and I knew that going into this.  The price matches the brush and the thicker handle on them make intricate designs a little less tedious than when I use the average size.  Perfect for exact detailing on nails.</li>
    <li> These are in great condition well crafted. My, nail work will look so professional,my nieces will probably love my work.</li>
    <li> Good quality, and don&#x27;t lose hairs, even after many uses and cleanings.</li>
    <li> I had long wanted a way to use some of my own polishes to stripe and decorate my nails and these give me the opportunity to do just that.  I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails at home but was in need of my own tools..I bought the brushes and they have never failed me! I am now always getting compliments on my nails everyday thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> I am learning to do my own nails an I love them so far with detail. bought three great buy</li>
    <li> they fell apart after one use.</li>
    <li> They are great! The only thing is the paint started to come off the first time I used them, which rubbed on my Haines and stained it! Make sure you wrap it in something before use</li>
    <li> These are just as good as the expensive brushes they have at Ulta or Sally at a 2000% markup. Buy these. They ship quick and cost about nothing. My stepdaughter is obsessed with nail art, so she is going to love her stocking full of fake expensive nail junk this Christmas! A dollar here and a dollar there doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
    <li> Nothing too fancy with these... You can&#x27;t go too wrong with them. The price is awesome and they get the job done. I&#x27;ve made some great nail art with them.</li>
    <li> weather your a  artist or a newbie&lt;br /&gt;these brushes will help you get your nail art to the next level.</li>
    <li> used for smaller lines while painting on paper, why am i writing a review, im so tired and bored, i turned 30 just by typing this,</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t last long, they started to come apart right after I got it. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lesson learned...no more orders form China, no matter how great the price &#x27;seems&#x27;!</li>
    <li> These are great at first but even after they were cleaned properly the bristles got hard and were useless. They work great for first time use though, other than that they&#x27;re trash, that was my experience anyway. I bought .....&amp;#34;15Pcs Nail Art Design Painting Drawing Brushes White + 5 X 2 Way Marbleizing Dotting Pen Tools Set &amp;#34;..... which work AMAZINGLY! After properly cleaning those brushes the bristles are smooth and soft like they&#x27;re suppose to be. Would recommend both but i think i&#x27;ll stick with the combo pack.</li>
    <li> ok but i thought they were black and instead were dark brown wouldnt have bought them if i knew since i dont like the color buy them if u dont mind that</li>
    <li> These brushes brought out the art in nail design! I love how theyre made and how fine the detail works in the tiniest design</li>
    <li> I love them. They kind of fell apart but I glued them back together.</li>
    <li> Tthese are really fantastic I have a 5 yr old and these are going to be used for a very long time !! im going to teach her how to do designs on my nails !! lol Im happy with my purchase they are great quality brushes I would Recommend them to anyone !</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for the price you cannot beat it</li>
    <li> The material was not good it brakes fast 😔</li>
    <li> Great for fine details.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t put in nail polish remover. Takes the black off the brush.</li>
    <li> The brush part pulled out easily of the metal</li>
    <li> Good product.  As described by seller.</li>
    <li> These are not well made brushes. No matter how much or how little polish I put on the brush it just comes out clumpy or thick. Oh well, at least they were cheap.</li>
    <li> I am yet to use them, but when I do I am sure I will learn to love them. I&#x27;d say it was a dollar well spent.</li>
    <li> A nice addition to my new collection of nail art supplies. Is good quality and if you clean them as you go they are great.</li>
    <li> These are not the most high quality brushes, but they arrived in perfect condition and work fine.  For the price I paid for them, I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Works great...super fun &amp; easy to clean too. Even my teenage daughrer likes doing her own nails, I save money.</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect for nail art.  All different sizes that can be cleaned and immediately bounce back to original shape.</li>
    <li> I purchased for kids and they are enjoying doing art on their nails if you enjoy this art purchase these brushes</li>
    <li> These are perfect for doing nail designs! Especially for zebra stripes, any kind of stripes, or just detailing. They were inexpensive and seem to be made of good product! Love love love!</li>
    <li> Not at all as expected, brushes are stiff and too long to manage easily for doing your own nails, would be semi ok to do another&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The brushes are a bit stiff and one of the came apart before I had the chance to use it. They aren&#x27;t bad for the price though and seem to do the job.</li>
    <li> All three of them broke and didnt really create straight lines. I guess they are worth the price. not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> i originally got these and they were broken. i was disappointed but the sender shortly after contacted me with an apology and sent me a replacement. very happy with how quickly they dealt with the issue.</li>
    <li> I like this set because it&#x27;s a great basic set of brushes. I use these a lot when painting freehand flowers and stripes. They are not great for small nail art details but other than that you can use them for pretty any other nail art that requires the use of a nail art brush.</li>
    <li> I have used these a couple times now, and they are pretty good. The only issue I had was one of the bristle ends came off, but I crimped it over the wood and it stays on just fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came on time, and intact.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a while back, and absolutely love it! It was a great price, and was not terrible quality. However, I also purchased a different set and the heads fell off.... So I knew that these were quite good quality. After purchasing a 3 brush set ( about three inches long) for 7 dollars at Walmart,  I figured the brush heads falling off was the norm... But, I have had these brushed for a long time, and use them for everything. I find that they&#x27;re great for outlining, and I can even write with them... Oh the manis! But anyway, these work amazingly... And I will be repurchasing these for friends in the future...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one problem, that I didn&#x27;t mention as it&#x27;s very minor and not worth loosing a star... Simply something to be careful of. When removing nail polish from your brush (if you are lazy and don&#x27;t wash your brushes after your done like me XD) you cannot get it on the wood part of your brush. Unlike the other set, it seemed like there was multiple layers of paint as I still can&#x27;t see the wood after doing it multiple times, but anyway, the paint immediately starts coming off a great deal, as it sort of drips... And goes EVERYWHERE haha I stained my carpet... Whoops... So anyway, it I have an obsession with these brushes..</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than I expected, and flimsier.  Honestly, who can complain! It&#x27;s so cheap, it&#x27;s worth it anyways. Yeah</li>
    <li> I thought that these brushes were going to be good for a few days only but  as it turns out, they work really well and are as good as new.</li>
    <li> The brushes were not the best, but i would suggest you not to buy them, i personally will not buy them again</li>
    <li> I will recommend you to purchase these brushes, they are very good for doing any type of nail art. love them</li>
    <li> These brushes are useless! I had to super glue the tip on one of the brushes. The other two brushes I had to throw away because the tips were so loose I couldn&#x27;t even glue them on the wooden stick.</li>
    <li> These nail art brushes are great. They have really elevated the quality of my nail designs. I would have loved an even smaller tip but overall they were a great buy.</li>
    <li> the nail polish sticks to the brushes so i tried dipping them in the bottle of nail polish remover and the black paint came off of the handles of the brushes and went everywhere. it didnt even touch the remover, just the fumes from being in the bottle. I had to hold them with a wet wipe to use them. worth the penny if ur okay with ony using them one time.</li>
    <li> We have six daughters and nails are painted almost daily around here. Perfect choice. I just wish I could figure out how to be creative.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes. They make perfect lines just the way I like them. The bristles hold a great line and I can do the little details I like when I draw on my nails.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use these for nail art however these are great for liquid/gel liners, very precise and much cheaper then buying one eyeliner brush from a makeup store online.</li>
    <li> These were ok.  I use paint brushes for Cake Decorating, and these are nice and thin.  Mine took a couple weeks to get them, but unlike some  other people, mine arrived in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I think they are well worth the price being charged!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; is all I can say.  You definitely get what you pay for.  Cheap brushes.  Don&#x27;t use nail polish remover on them.  They fall apart at the seal.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nail art!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and helpful. Some of the bristles needed to be trimmed tho, they stuck out at odd angles which destroyed the precision. You get what you pay for, but these were worth the money. And they got here pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
    <li> The bristles are terrible and after one use they were stiff as heck! Wasn&#x27;t able to use them more than once which was disappointing. There&#x27;s also barely any bristle making it difficult to draw on the patterns.</li>
    <li> These are nice brushed, but the tops fell off and I had to re-glue it.</li>
    <li> Tip fell off of brushes before first use. Just glued them back on, what do you want for less than $1.00</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! They are cheap and do not work.</li>
    <li> really nice, I love them</li>
    <li> Used these the other day and it gives me the designs ive been wanting to create for months! no need for a nail salon!</li>
    <li> These are good quality brushes but they smell really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an odd complaint --- I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the odor is *really* strong. It seems to be  emanating from the plastic brush handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be a good quality, but I shall report back after I&#x27;ve used them for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they stand up, then they would be a nice buy for other painting projects (professional brushes can cost $5-$10 each and it&#x27;s difficult to find nice, small brushes that keep their shape properly, so we&#x27;ll see.)</li>
    <li> Great item thank you.</li>
    <li> Just as described! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I just received the brushes today they came in perfect condition and works beautifully for detailing. It was exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I had a problem with my address due to moving. I explained situation to seller and now I have my product, sent to new address, and I will definitely recommend that anyone who wants to purchase something, see if they have it first because they have made me very happy and I am now using my nail art brushes to do detailed writing on nails :)</li>
    <li> Not the greatest thing I have bought. The handles are very potent, they smell like they have just been spray painted. My bedroom smelt like that for days. Then the actual brush heads were unusable as the strands has separated not giving the desired affect of fine lines for a design. Managed to salvage one by cutting the stray strands off. Since using them I have cleaned then and the paint on the handles has come away.</li>
    <li> When I got these I opened them and they stank and reaked of spray paint it was so gross I had to them air out for like 2 days then when I tried to use the brushes the bristles were bent and I had to cut them and when I tried to do detail designs on some fake nails they didn&#x27;t work I was disappointed BUT then I used them for body/face painting and they work great for detailing with that so overall I am happy with them but I use them for face and body painting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, but I do my nails a lot, and these brushes are great to work with. The bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out yet, which is awesome because I even used it with my heaviest paint- the gel!</li>
    <li> The handles are very thick and the bristles on the brushes arrived all bent. :( I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but the brush top fell off the wooden holder literally in two days, but the brush tips was great for designs, but too cheap</li>
    <li> The handles are pretty big but the brushes are great. I&#x27;m actually able to do many more designs now. Very pleased,</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for sending me these great brushes at such a good price! I look forward to shopping with you again.</li>
    <li> Terrible product! The metal part wight he brush came off so that sucked then when I tried to use them, I got a little bit of remover on the handle at the paint started to come off. What a waste</li>
    <li> These work lovely, I use them for my nail art, I haven&#x27;t gotten any hair fall out so that&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> I would invest in better brushes if you plan on doing anything delicate or professional. The tips of the brushes look smaller than they really are and even with the smallest brush I have a difficult time applying fine lines.</li>
    <li> Tried to use these. I peeled the plastic cover off the tips, put there to protect them during shipping, and the whole top of the brush came off. I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to use it! Tried to use another one...the paint from the handle came off on my hands when I dipped the tip in polish remover. The &#x27;tips&#x27; are cheap and if it&#x27;s really sable, then save the animals. Seriously. It&#x27;s wasted on these brushes. I should have known when it said &#x27;made in China&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes and used them the same day. I was using China Glaze nail polish and Sally&#x27;s acetone. The silver portion of the brush came loose from the wooden base. I was able to use it on two nails and than it fell apart.</li>
    <li> I just love them cant believe how satisfied I am for this set of brushes, am going to order for more as a gift</li>
    <li> I like the brushes However they arrived broken.  Wrote an email to the company and have not heard anything back.  It&#x27;s been a week.  Due to the lack of customer customer I gave this two stars. Some reply back would have been nice but nothing at all.</li>
    <li> i can do so many things with these and i have used them for about 6 different designs so far :)</li>
    <li> I use acetone/nail polish remover, but just one use with nail polish is a little tough to wash out. Even when the polish is still wet...</li>
    <li> After using my brushes once, the metal tips were falling off of the wooden sticks. I threw some glue on them, but you get what you pay for. The brushes themselves are ok.</li>
    <li> I just love my new brushes they are4 very easy to use and are super cute and not to big.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t hold enough paint to make a long line.  Stripers with longer hairs work better. Not a big fan of these and I find them hard to use.</li>
    <li> I think these are going to be neat My grand daughter loves to paint nails I will see what she thinks</li>
    <li> These are great for the price. Work well and they are tiny and perfect for designs on nails.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how they will hold up only time will tell.</li>
    <li> Daughter is always doing her nails, so these were a big help to her</li>
    <li> They were not suppose to arrive for two to three more weeks, but they are here!  Very happy.  Thanks :)</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t buy these but got them from a website you participate in things to earn points and redeem your points, i got these...i knew for 1$ they were going to be super cheap..they stink like..well i can&#x27;t pin the smell..but it smells chemically..and there is no glue or any thing holding the silver tip to the wood post..fine by me..for 1$ included and free shipping..im not complaining..even if they fall apart while im using them...thats fine too..they could have packaged them a little better though instead of wrapping them in a plastic bag and sending it that way...maybe put some card board around it or some thing..</li>
    <li> The are a must have for nail art enthusiasts.  I use a nail sponge tub to remove the polish from brushes for easy clean up. Love these.</li>
    <li> Granted, I didn&#x27;t spend a lot on these, but I expected more. The tips constantly fall off. I finally gave up and threw them in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Poor craftsmanship from factory. Same ol cheap junk as always. Tip fell off as soon as we took protective cover off. Prob not gonna order anything else from this company</li>
    <li> They are ok, not the best.  But not the worst either. I&#x27;m not going to buy them again sorry. Kinda cheap.</li>
    <li> The brushes them selves are a great material but the quality of the bristles are not so great. It is great for the money.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for here.  The tips have popped off all of them and I have had to hot glue them back on.</li>
    <li> This are great for nail art decoration. They are easy to use and easy to make  any kind of nail art . If you want to decorate your nails it is a must have</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice brushes and well worth the price. I would definitely buy them again. They are easy to use and hold and are comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money not even a 1.42........ BTW I only put 1 star because it was required....... again if they knew better they do better</li>
    <li> The price was right, and the different sizes convenient for decorating nails. Bought for my daughter who seems to like them well enough.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t started using these yet but they feel really good quality wise. I like that it is made of wood. It also arrive sooner than I expected especially coming from overseas.</li>
    <li> exactly as i expected. did have a bit of a hard time cleaning but other than that they are perfect.</li>
    <li> Here again you use the word pen and brushes in the same sentence.  They do work okay, but not as I anticipated.</li>
    <li> Whether using these for nail art or for detailing while face painting they have a nice handle and fine brushes making outlining and drawing easy and paint flows nicely.</li>
    <li> the product is too flimsy and not able to clean it at all. the black and sliver parts are not attached properly. once it its used i couldn&#x27;t remover the polish from the brushes. very bad. do not buy.</li>
    <li> This nail brush came early than expect from the post office. This item can be use to edit your nails and put stuff on your nails such as stickers and such.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product and it came in before it was said to of.  Brushes are very thin for tiny lines to be painted.  Seems to be great for nail art.</li>
    <li> Must haves for nail art!</li>
    <li> Took forever to receive these, I believe they did come in the time frame, but took over a month. The one brush immediately broke as soon as I took it out of the package. I can still use it but I have to be careful. They&#x27;re okay brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! Soft, firm tips and good size handles. You can really make a nice design with these...</li>
    <li> Nice pigmented shadow for being a knock off..... Recommend if don&#x27;t want to spend the money on the real one.</li>
    <li> Good addition to nail kit for small lines and details. Very basic brush easy to use. No loss of bristles.</li>
    <li> The tips to these brushes fell off before I even took them out of the package! I guess that a gamble you take paying only 30 cents for something though</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like these brushes because the bristles are very stiff. I was trying to do stripes on my nail but the brushes weren&#x27;t working very well. I am going to keep trying to get the to work but I&#x27;m not liking them very much now.</li>
    <li> more like paintbrushes than nail polish brushes. didn&#x27;t work too well with one color over another. have to learn how to use them better</li>
    <li> One broke the day I opened the package. The bristles are flimsy, and It&#x27;s hard to complete a perfect stripe. I wouldn&#x27;t get any more brushes like these!</li>
    <li> my wife and 2 granddaughters love to do nails  mimi and the kids spend hours playing ladies  they did red, white and blue for 4th of july with stars and stripes  hope they get enjoyment using this item</li>
    <li> painting is super fine with these brushes. I use them to paint details on polymer clay sculpts where fine lines are really important. Great price! I purchased three sets. I won&#x27;t share!</li>
    <li> These Art Brushes are easy to use especially because I am a beginner and am excited to keep on tryng.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I can not review this Item do to I have not receive it yet. I am hoping that it comes soon</li>
    <li> The handles and brushes are shaped well, but the metal collar holding the brush is not well adhered and has already fallen off once. They work pretty well though. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> i choose this item specifically for my nails, just to experiment with them and to practice designs on them, but the brush doesn&#x27;t brush on good, it&#x27;s an okay product. just not all that..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do i recommend it? yeah just use the right polish or paint.</li>
    <li> The items came after a few weeks. They look pretty nice. Unfortunately the bristles look a little bent. I guess for the price, it is as expected. The brushes don&#x27;t have as dramatic of a size difference as they do in the stock photo.</li>
    <li> Product came in a timely fashion (even if it was shipped from Hong Kong) and I just love them. Definite buy</li>
    <li> I use these brushes every day.  I recommend them to everyone. They work for all kinds of nail art and painting.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice to work with and leave a nice smooth line or dot. They transfer the paint to nail nicely.</li>
    <li> good brush set. would buy again. brushes are a little stiff  but manageable. took awhile to deliver but for a dollar its cool.</li>
    <li> Work well and lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> I think these brushes are really great. I do wish that they stayed a liiiiittle more stiff for what nail designs I wanted them for and be very careful when in contact with nail polish remover because the black paint from the handle will wipe off!! Overall good quality (they could&#x27;ve skipped the paint on the handle) and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> They came sooner than I thought, which is GREAT since I wanted to use them asap. They are exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> My wife runs a nail salon and she has constant requirement for nail art brush pens. I wanted to gift her something for her salon&#x27;s first anniversary and I decided to go for this awesome Sable nail art brush pen. I was glad the product reached on time to surprise her. She was glad that I was thoughtful in getting the right gift for her. It is a set of three brushes meant for different purpose of stripping, mini stripping and detail. She says the brush is so well designed that even a beginner can paint amazing designs with this brush. Whether fine detailing or long stripping this brush set can make everything simple.</li>
    <li> Really good for doing designs</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these at all. They are too soft. They don&#x27;t make clean lines or thin lines...</li>
    <li> these are really small so you get a really good grip on them. maybe if they were longer though, you might not have to constantly dip them into the nail polish. regardless, i love them &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Used this once, im a 1st timer that didnt research r youtube the product.  So I messed up and tried to clean the finger nail polish off with finger nail polish remover. A big no no....lol my stick is color oak(wood)</li>
    <li> these brushes were bigger then I thought they would be like paint brushes I needed them much smaller to do nails but I was able to cut down to do it  thank you</li>
    <li> You might want to pay a little more money for some better quality brushes, but for the price they&#x27;re sold at, I guess they&#x27;re ok. One of the brush&#x27;s bristles arrived bent, but they&#x27;re still usable. And another brush broke because I think I presses too hard, but it was easy for me to slide it back in to place. I like using them, they&#x27;re easy to use and to get nail polish on the brush, I paint some on a piece of paper, then dip them brush into the nail polish on the paper. And use nail polish remover to clean the brushes afterwards so the nail polish doesn&#x27;t dry on the brush.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails and needed different brushes. I only used one of them so fair and was happy with it</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived on time and there weren&#x27;t any problems with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it the metal holding the bristles of the brush actually fell off the wooden handle. I didn&#x27;t apply too much force or damage in taking it out of the packing, so this was definitely a manufacturing mistake. I have yet to try the other two brushes.</li>
    <li> A+ shipping, bought for my wife and she loves it and uses it all the time. she said she would recommend it.</li>
    <li> These brushes looked exactly like the picture BUT they were cheaply manufactured. The heads came off the handle just removing them from their packaging and had to be glued back on, the hairs came out of the barrel the first time I used them, they shed like a yeti! However, for the price you get what you pay for. Wash them really well first and maybe that will eliminate the shedding and I did have to glue the heads back on them.</li>
    <li> Nice n professional does the job, had good results with my nail art will buy more whn needed nice price</li>
    <li> Great price for they are not often found in store</li>
    <li> Took forever to come, and were very cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again...</li>
    <li> I received these brushes early and I am happy with my order.my neice will love this for Christmas.</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t what I expected. The brushes hardly hold enough polish for me to finish my strokes. I have to keep dipping and going over them, and they do not give my strokes a nice point at the end. I&#x27;m thinking they were not soft enough, or maybe the bristles needed to be a different material. Maybe I will try mixing the polish with water so it will absorb into the brush better, but I may get a different set in the future. I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> Seller was pleasant to work with.  Brushes are as described.  Good for detail work.</li>
    <li> great product, great seller</li>
    <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
    <li> It took a long time to get here and they weren&#x27;t even good quality</li>
    <li> very cheap, and they work great! i would recomend them to anyone who is interested in nail art. just make sure to clean the brushes after each use</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, but the metal tips holding the bristles fell off of 2/3 of the brushes the moment I removed them from the packaging. No big deal, I glued them back on with some super glue. Otherwise, they seem pretty good.</li>
    <li> One of my tools looked like someone was chewing on it its all chewed up :( looks like it was melted or chewed up</li>
    <li> These fell apart before I actually used them.  The sad part is the glue that holds them together was not dry.  The bag they arrived it really smelled bad (like chemicals) and when I pulled the clear protective covering off the brush part, the entire end piece came off and exposed the glue substance which was not dry.  File this under waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased these a little while ago and just got around to using them. First time out of the package, when I went to take the protective plastic tip off, the whole metal top and brushes came off with it. For the price, which is excellent, it is still worth the investment. Nothing a little super glue won&#x27;t fix. The  bristles are a little wide for the size specified on the brush so be sure to dip them into some water before using them so they don&#x27;t spread as much and just use light strokes with them. Other than falling apart (but fixable like I said) these brushes seem okay. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> All the grey parts broke off by the third day. I tried glueing it back on but it still broke</li>
    <li> Good for the price. they are long, the end is thin so you can dip it directly in the bottle of nail polish.</li>
    <li> I used these to create a nail design the brush is just okay and cheap. They STINK horrible like a rubber and poison factory and they metal parts slide off from the wooden base. But these and my clear nails tips came in SUPER fast like weeks before estimated delivery</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived quickly. They are long and thin. They came in a plastic pouch which is very useful. I gave it four stars because I was concern that the brushes had a really strong odor, I don&#x27;t know what type of odor but it was unusual and I was hoping it was not something to be concerned about.</li>
    <li> I had to wait like a month or more for these brushes.... They&#x27;re not bad for the price. Wish I could have received them sooner....</li>
    <li> These are your basic nail brushes, but for the price and use they are perfect. You can never have to many!</li>
    <li> Nice tool, but the black paint comes off with nail polish remover, so I got it all over my finger!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the pictures. Every brush was the exact same size. I thought well...maybe my eyes are deceiving me. So I tried all of them out, and unfortunately they all made the same size line. No nail art fun for me with THESE brushes. Do yourself a favor and get some different brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a couple weeks ago and it said the earliest it would be here was the 1st, well it&#x27;s the 20th. So it got here thirteen days early.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re really nice and very small, good for nails.&lt;br /&gt;They also come with a plastic cap for protection.&lt;br /&gt;10/10</li>
    <li> They work for what I bought them for.  I needed a sharp point and they have a good one. Good</li>
    <li> I love these guys.  The handles are longer than I expected, but that isn&#x27;t a problem by any means.  The brushes themselves are a little stiff but that keeps them from falling apart when you apply the polish.  I am so pleased with this purchase.  I can make straight lines, curves, and waves.  :)</li>
    <li> I was so excited for these, The #0 and #00 broke and the #000 is about to. Buy something else!</li>
    <li> For the price, these definitley were worth the money. I&#x27;ve only used them a fewe times, but they work great.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best. They are perfect to use if you are making a flower design or a masterpiece on your nail</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife. She does her own, as well as others&#x27; nails. She loves the brushes and the detailed designs she can create with these little brushes. The quality is great! She highly recommends this product!</li>
    <li> this helped me do a few designs on my nails like that it was easy to use with my left hand since my nails are always done better with the right hand but this helped so i have no complaints</li>
    <li> Love these things...did my nieces nails the other day...Shoot I could be a nail artist...jk i wouldnt take it that far...these are actually pretty good.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to use on nails but, out of desperation when my eye liner brush broke, I took one and used it.  It&#x27;s now my NEW favorite eye liner brush!!! Allows me to be very precise and so much faster to put my liner on now.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes, excited to try the new ways I can do nail art</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I use it to apply lipstick. With these you don&#x27;t need to apply the lip liner, you can line your lips using your lipstick with this brush!</li>
    <li> Sometimes the tops come off but a dab of superglue will donthe trick. Other than that that theyre great</li>
    <li> I like them, they work nice.  but the silver tip quickly comes off, easily slips back on but still not a great quality.</li>
    <li> 1. It took a while to get here, but earlier than the estimated delivery which was about a month from when I ordered it&lt;br /&gt;2. Very bad quality, you can tell as soon as you open the package. For example there was dried glue along the side of the metal part.&lt;br /&gt;3. On my first use, the brush/metal part fell off of the wooden stick.&lt;br /&gt;4. Nevertheless, it does make lines, and can be used as a striper.&lt;br /&gt;5. After using it, I quickly dunked it in a container of nail polish remover, so it could be re-used but the nail polish did not completely come off, even after soaking it for a long time. So it is still half-usable, but sticky and not very brush-like anymore.&lt;br /&gt;6. I do not use it anymore, and I would not recommend to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet but this is what I wanted for detailing and I will try them out this weekend</li>
    <li> It was expected because of the price that they wouldn&#x27;t last long.  after a short amount of time the brush got all weird and unusable. But I guess its good for the price. Just don&#x27;t expect it to last long at all</li>
    <li> The heads broke off the first time I tried to use them. The nail polish doesn&#x27;t come out of them even if you soak it in nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> These are cheap and do not work well</li>
    <li> Great size but metal separated from handle quickly.</li>
    <li> Godd for the cost. Non shedding.</li>
    <li> These are really good brushes, but when I dipped one into aced tone to clean it and it started to melt. The silver part melted off. Its not an easy cleaning process. As for designs its not that bad.</li>
    <li> Its not a great quality, is useless because i bought it for make designs in my nails but the brushes doesn&#x27;t have enough hair to make it</li>
    <li> My wife is a painter as has enjoy the set</li>
    <li> The tips broke off almost immediately.</li>
    <li> these are very useful to my mail art collection. thank you very much for the fast delivery :)</li>
    <li> They came on time and get the job done. I only need them for school but I could use them on clients with no embarrassment if I needed to.</li>
    <li> These are great for all the decorating I do on my nails. I can finally make cool designs on my nails and they actually turn out.</li>
    <li> perfect i have had them for a year now and no complaints, will defiantly reorder when i need to :)</li>
    <li> Only clean the brush part dont clean the stick, the paint will come off and with get sticky</li>
    <li> I ordered these about a month ago. I was super excited because I have been looking for some decent nail art brushes. Once they arrive I opened the package and to my surprise there were no brushes there. I received fake eyelashes. I didn&#x27;t want nor need eyelashes. -_-</li>
    <li> The brushes are too stiff to be much use and lose their shape when used but they are a very good starter set for those of us who have no idea what we&#x27;re doing in terms of nail art.</li>
    <li> Have not used this for my nails yet but I did use the extra brush to line my eye lids with my liquid liner. Omg, it works so well... What a steal!!</li>
    <li> Either the brushes were painted black or whatever, but my first use I used my acetone fingernail polish remover to clean them and they were turned brown! Weird, but hey you get what you paid for. Other than that the brush part splits too much so I really dont use them</li>
    <li> I saw these and had to have them. Not only do I use these for delicate nail art, I ordered a set for painting as well! Love them!</li>
    <li> Quality great, easy to handle for my teenage granddaughter, who I purchased them for her to use. Would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered them in march and it&#x27;s now June and I still haven&#x27;t gotten them. It said that the latest it would be here is May but I still haven&#x27;t gotten them so what&#x27;s wrong are they still coming because if not then I want my money back</li>
    <li> The paint on the handle all came off when Nail polish spilled all over them it did not work :(</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not as small as they appear, they stink (smell of them just being glued, I assume) and they aren&#x27;t as narrow as they look. They were only .88 cent so it&#x27;s not too bad of a deal.</li>
    <li> i have had these for well over a year now. They work well, they clean easily, but don&#x27;t leave them in water! The wood and paint on the handle is cheap. The paint on mine started to chip and the wood get soft, so just avoid leaving these in water and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nail designs!</li>
    <li> These were okay. I couldn&#x27;t really do much with them because the bristles were hard to manage on nails. I would suggest looking into small paint brushes if you&#x27;re trying to get an intricate look.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I cut the bristles at the base of the ferrule (silver part) about 1/4 of the way in to make the brush thinner</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. brush heads fall off during cleaning and you cant get them back on ..</li>
    <li> The brushes were ok, however the tips fell off of the wood part, they weren&#x27;t that expensive so I really didn&#x27;t get too upset about it. I gave them to my granddaughter so she can paint her fingernails when I paint mine</li>
    <li> i like how the brush is cured a little at the tip so it makes it easyier to draw designs</li>
    <li> So pissed my dog chew them up I have to order more. These are grey for nail art or getting in hard place to polish</li>
    <li> One of them came broken, the head was off, but it is easily fixable. Small enough to make nice designs on the nails, cleaned with nails polish remover- though the color of the brush seemed stripped off after this. Still worth it in my opinion, considering the cheap price.</li>
    <li> I like the sizes and shapes of these brushes you can do alot with them, but keep in mind just having nice brushes won&#x27;t make awesome designs appear on your nails.  the only thing that I had a problem with was that immediately upon opening the 00 brush fell off of the black part (it&#x27;s a simple fix though, I just taped it up with some scotch). All that being said I would recommend these brushes to someone interested in doing there own nails but would encourage anyone trying to do other people&#x27;s nails to go find some other brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush tips are pretty cheap. After one use and a good cleaning they weren&#x27;t the same. I&#x27;d recommend spending a little more on nail brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes fell apart on me really quickly.  I supposed I got what I paid for, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.  I just wont buy them again!</li>
    <li> Takes a few weeks to ship,  but the price is worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they give me the percise control that I wanted for my toe nail art designs. The only thing is you have to make sure you let the polish dry inbetween each step the brushes are very strong.</li>
    <li> For the price these are great. Daughter uses them for painting wonderful art on her nails. As described. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got the brushes in a timely manner.  They arrived well packaged with plastic protectors over each brush.  The quality was excellent and I was able to make great nail designs.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have been learning nail art for a year. With the old brushes i have it was hard to paint certain things, but with these ones its much easier.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, my granddaughter loves them</li>
    <li> The metal part fell apart from the wooden handle within five minutes. I most definitely would not recommend this product, it&#x27;s a good thing they were cheap or I&#x27;d be really mad.</li>
    <li> i got these with in a couple weeks and im really happy with them. i was surprised with the quallity. i would recomend these.</li>
    <li> The product is easy to use and thin enough for me to complete intricate details on my nails. The product came a week before the estimated arrival date and for the price it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> Bristles are too thin to really do anything. Can&#x27;t make small lines because the hair will stray. not sure if I&#x27;ll ever use them again but they were cheap so I&#x27;m not upset.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes broke the second I opened it...all the bristles had fallen out in one clump.</li>
    <li> I Love these paint brushes!!  They create fine lines in painting!!  The are Superb and the Very Best!!  Absolutely the Best!!  Highly recommended!!  I bought a few sets they are so Great!!</li>
    <li> Nice grip smooth feel. Great application</li>
    <li> My daughter loves nail polish and art. I thought she would really enjoy being able to paint designs on her own nails. She loved these. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived on time as promised and in perfect condition. The brushes are well made and the sable is secure with no fall out.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The metal pieces with the bristles on one of the brushes was damaged when I recieved them otherwise they work fine.</li>
    <li> These brushes work really well and they were such a great price. The brushes are tiny, but the handle is big enough to hold comfortably.</li>
    <li> Great little set of brushes. Arrived in good time. Only issue I had is one of the heads popped off when I took them out of the bag, easily fixed with a small dag of glue though. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> A really lovely item for the price, I love the item, will continue shopping for items as such, Thank you</li>
    <li> i barely used them since last year, but i can say they are made of good quality materials. i liked them.</li>
    <li> They were kind of think so I had to trim them down, but I have unusually petite hands. I would definitely suggest these. They are great for nail art.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made.. Metal part comes off the wood part all the time.</li>
    <li> great for detail work</li>
    <li> These Nail Art Brushes - Professional Nail Art Brushes - Sable Nail Art Brush Pen, Detailer, liner, set of 3 look pretty good and arrived quickly. I cannot wait to use them!</li>
    <li> the metal which connects the brush to the wooden handle- EASILY&lt;br /&gt;•bends&lt;br /&gt;• rusts&lt;br /&gt;• completely falls off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional in the field and was quite unhappy</li>
    <li> I received the nail art brushes quickly. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use them yet, but they look like they are good quality. Nice and sturdy and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be having any problems with them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as if I can only use them once. I use it. Clean it. Use it again but all the bristles are frayed after I clean them.</li>
    <li> Nice small tip brushes. Perfect</li>
    <li> i use them for everything they good.</li>
    <li> These are just okay. My hand is steady enough where I can  paint my right hand, but I needed these for stripers since I didn&#x27;t have many that already had came with them, but in my opinion they make it harder to use cause I think they&#x27;re harder than like a regular striper, but I still use them!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and I love them :)</li>
    <li> I use these brushes for my art, not my nails.  They do not keep their shape too long.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  I&#x27;ve used all of them.  My favorite is the one with the shortest brush.  It really lets you add detail easily.</li>
    <li> love them going to be very useful for desinging my daughters nails.</li>
    <li> They are the perfect size and they paint really well!</li>
    <li> Not as sturdy to use with nail polish as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well for the price. They aren&#x27;t as stiff as I would like them, but they do make good stripes. Just don&#x27;t try to draw a lot with them, because it&#x27;s very difficult. If you&#x27;re just wanting to make simple stripes, these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this brushes. It&#x27;s easy to use and it works well. I can do any design on my nails.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price. All of the tips were lose though and easily pulled off. I just super glued them on, no biggie. Takes about 3 weeks to arrive, but again, can&#x27;t complain too much for the price!</li>
    <li> Really smells bad and not as great for detail nail art work. I bought it because it said for detail nail art work but for not so detailed work it worked fine.</li>
    <li> I like how small the brushes come, I do a lot of detail work, so this is awesome to have. Hard to clean though.</li>
    <li> For the price these aren&#x27;t bad nail art brushes.  They are nice and thin which is what I was looking for</li>
    <li> The brushes seem to be high quality; however, 2 of the 3 brushes had their metal tips fall off.  Super glue fixed the problem but it&#x27;s always a little disappointing when you have to fix a product before the first use.</li>
    <li> I have been doing nails for a long time, and this was my first time buying designing brushes off line instead of a beauty salon. The brushes were thicker than I expected, so it was much harder for me to do even the simple designs, let alone the intricate ones.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful, and the buying process was a five star experience!</li>
    <li> I have a collection of brushes and accesories.  Really like that the brushes are tiny so the polish is applied exactly where you want it</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was expecting and it even came much earlier than they had originally estimated it would.</li>
    <li> Very nice!!! Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Loved it!!!!!! Very Good!!! So Recommending This!!!! Awesome Amazing Great!!!!!! Cool!!!!!</li>
    <li> They work well I use them to color in  images  got here way on time then I expected since they ship from Hong Kong</li>
    <li> Great Product for those into nail designs!</li>
    <li> I like how skinny the brushes are.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that they are so hard to clean even if you clean them get hard:(&lt;br /&gt;But for the price it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I am working some time from home while waiting on my next baby. this brushes will work good for my nail business and the price is low.</li>
    <li> They are quality brushes that let you try some of the cute things for nails. Would recommend to all that want to try something new.</li>
    <li> These work well for my nail art. They take the paint well and applies perfect on the nail bed. Love!</li>
    <li> great quality, work perfectly for painting in the small crevices.&lt;br /&gt;worth the money and nicely priced. I have bought more.</li>
    <li> I love painting my finger nails during the holidays. These brushes help immensely when trying to add small details on your nails. The handles are comfortable and you can even use the other side if you want polka dots.</li>
    <li> I got what i paid for. They were ok nothing major they got the job done. Good for the price</li>
    <li> I use these to do nail art but the silver brush part keeps popping off the handle. But they make nice thin lines and are soft, so far no issue with the brush itself falling apart.</li>
    <li> These brushes get the job done but the only complaint that I have it that the bristles tend to separate and you have to squeeze them back together.</li>
    <li> They are good and I enjoy doing nail art with them.</li>
    <li> i gave it a 5 because it came several days earlier than&lt;br /&gt;expected arrival. the brush is also easy to use and it&lt;br /&gt;has not given me any problems yet. i would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product to my friends who likes nail art.</li>
    <li> Wanted these to be part of a gift set, but they have never arrived.  I can still use them, if the order is ever filled.</li>
    <li> I recieved all the brushes and every single brush was bent and broken. I do not recommend this product to anyone. It may be cheap but you certainly get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> They are great for doing eyeliner too!</li>
    <li> I have only used one of them and only used it once. So I am not sure yet on the quality of the brushes, but they were cheap and delivered fast. They seem like they are good quality and it was rather easy to clean it out, but if they fall apart after a few uses, I don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
    <li> These brushes were packaged nicely and fast shipping. Just like I expected, good brushes. Would buy again. Would recommend to anyone wanting to decorate their nails.</li>
    <li> SHOTTY brushes that all fell off</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the brushes I could only use it once because they fell apart after the first use. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I recieved the products within the time frame of my purchase the bush part was frayed when I recieved them so I had to trim them up but for the price not a bad product.</li>
    <li> Nice little set of nail brushes..for nails. I plan on using mine for drawing and coloring flowers in on my art</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes knowing that they were shipping from China but for the price I did not care how long it took for them to get here. Turns out they arrived in less than 10 days. The sender even included a cute little butterfly Magnet inside to show his appreciation for my business. Would buy from again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Item its well packaged feels good in your hands and the brush itself is accurate when using on nails. I would buy more when I need them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good price and product when I got them I had to sing for them...but it&#x27;s what I wanted</li>
    <li> Perfect for detail in nail art. Very worth.buying</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> Good quality, nice long handles make for excellent control of the brush tip. Sizes are perfect for detail work on your nailart</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Ive been needing them for a while and finally bought some. really great for making detailed designs on nails. really tiny and exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> The brushes I received were not what was pictured... I specifically ordered these because I needed tiny brushes, the ones I received were not very tiny at all..</li>
    <li> love this and it was shipped so quickly ... I will be ordering from this site again !!! thanks for the product!!!</li>
    <li> The brush handles have a smell to it, otherwise the tips are small enough and works good.  I would recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> Product is ok shipped in good time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even use nail polish with it it came to me broken i can get better quality at the dollar store</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Bad quality but I mean the price was really cheap so I guess it was expected.</li>
    <li> I love these nail brushes! They are so easy too use and very useful for me! 5 stars for sure.</li>
    <li> Needed smaller brushes do to a leopard or cheetah print for my nails. These work great and hold shape even after use. We&#x27;re a little stiff one the first use but after that they were fine. Would recommend to any one looking for great nail brushes.</li>
    <li> Great price!!!! Great product!!! I fell so in love with these the first time i used them. I think I will use these every time i do my nails.</li>
    <li> Fine, firm brush. Able to make nice neat lines. Cleaned up well. No lost hairs during clean up with acetone.</li>
    <li> I was really happy to get some nail art brushes but guess what. When I opened the package the where all bent and one was broke. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Would like a larger size, but they work</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good if you are a nail art enthusiast. There are cheap and well worth it. I have bought brushes at professional shops that didn&#x27;t last me long. They arrived in perfect condition and they got here in about 10 days. I&#x27;ve used them a couple times and cleaned them with acetone and they don&#x27;t melt or get ugly.</li>
    <li> These brushes were not what I expected. They worked okay the first time I used them, but once I washed them the brush stayed rock solid. I wasn&#x27;t able to use them again because they would ruin my nail design. I wish they would have been better. I eventually just tossed them.</li>
    <li> Brushes were broken, the metAl part holding the hairs of the brush is flimsy</li>
    <li> Great product and price!</li>
    <li> Great love how the handle is thicker then the tip gets skinny so you can get the polish out</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for making cute, small designs on your nails!</li>
    <li> The brisills fell off and got on my nails and ruined my nails.</li>
    <li> Brushes came broken !!!!!! Wtf !!! Cheap!!! Stay away from this product /brushes ... Go buy other brushes... Very very cheap ... Never buying this again!!!</li>
    <li> I received these on time but all three of them were broken, the heads to the brushes all came off and i had to glue them back on. I got what i paid for but def. not worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I have used these brushes for several things now...but they do work very well for nail art...definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from them but they amazed me. The price has since gone up but I still am planning on ordering another set or two.</li>
    <li> Went to use one for the first time and it broke. I know they are cheap but I expected to be able to use them.</li>
    <li> These look nothing like the pictures. I was hoping for tiny detailing brushes, which is not what I got at all. The smallest one is a good 2/3&amp;#34; long and thicker than a striping brush. The biggest one is as long as a striping brush (over 1&amp;#34;) and is really really thick. Just looking at them you can tell they are nothing like the picture shows.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly! :)</li>
    <li> I am new to nail design and self taught, and found these brushes easy to handle and the perfect length.</li>
    <li> Have only used a few times but they work alright, they get the job done when I do my nails</li>
    <li> These are great! The other michaels brush I had just wasn&#x27;t cutting it so I got these and they were more than I expected! They look soo professional! The 0 brush is to big for very detailed designs but good for animal print or other things. I&#x27;m in love with the 00 brush! It&#x27;s super skinny and so thin! The 000 brush is super short and flared out on the top as I used it but when it&#x27;s wet it&#x27;s very pointy. Overall I&#x27;m in love with these brushes and I totally recommend them to any person who loves making designs on your nails.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mom &amp; she loves them! They&#x27;re very nice and sturdy to use as well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend more than you need to, these are perfect for nail art!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good but I really wish the brushes were a little bit shorter because when you are painting nails it gets kind of hard to control.</li>
    <li> i dont use much of it but i think its very usifull if u need to do special stuff. good quality</li>
    <li> They work for the most part however, the metal don&#x27;t stay connected to the handle. It makes a huge mess when they fall off during a design.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for small detail nail art! Perfect and recommended! Good quality and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price!</li>
    <li> These were made of such cheap &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; that they all arrived broken at the base of the metal head.  I tried gluing them back together but the wood is so airy there wasn&#x27;t much to stick together so they are all crooked.</li>
    <li> Cheap product. Metal detached from wood soon after using.</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect for detail work on finger nails and toe nails.  Fast shipping and they are exactly what I was expecting.  They have a nice, thick handle and the bristles are cut very finely.  The ferrule on two of the brushes is slightly loose, but that can be easily fixed with a little glue.  I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> The brushes are really well made. They came a lot faster than I expected. Such a great deal for such a low price! Would recommend :)</li>
    <li> When I ordered these it said it would take more than a month to get here, it took 2 weeks which is good for overseas shipping.  The brushes were all unbroken and were in good condition when they came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are good, they have nice smooth handles, much better balance than a paint brush and they have very nice tips.  I have heard from the other reviews that Nail Polish remover will strip the paint so keep them away from each other, though a little remover on the bristles cleans well.  There was 1 stray hair on one of the brushes but other than that they were uniform shape as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a good buy, especially for the price and they don&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought these nail brushes to use for nail art. I&#x27;m no professional but they seem  to do a nice job creating the looks I&#x27;m going for.&lt;br /&gt;The barrels are longer than I thought they&#x27;d be but I&#x27;m ok with that. They seem really nice quality for a novice.</li>
    <li> Careful with the acetone, they will fall apart. Good bristles if you clean them well and let them air dry. Nice handle shape, adds to control of brush. I have bought them twice.</li>
    <li> Great nail art brushes for the price. Fine bristles, which is exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> Love the nail art brushes!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mom and she loves them! She says they are precise and easy to use for drawing cute little designs on nails! She would recommend this product to others looking for good quality nail art brushes!</li>
    <li> these so worth the price! and they do come very fast so don&#x27;t let the estimated shipping date set you back on buying them. love them.</li>
    <li> The handle is too thick and the bristles are too flimsy to make precise lines.</li>
    <li> Poor glue job. The tops of the brushes come off.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t find them very useful but they do work. I am also not one to do my nails a lot so, the if you are the kind of person who does you would find this very helpful</li>
    <li> dollar store quality....</li>
    <li> Works very well with doing nail art.  Would recommend to all looking for nail art brushes.  Arrived in a timely fashion.  Not a complaint at all.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them that much but they seem like they work decently well and they are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very small– perfect for fine lines. I only wish they were more sturdy; the hairs are so fine that they&#x27;re almost flimsy...maybe I just need to practice my technique.</li>
    <li> use the bead of paint to draw the lines, not the brush itself. that i did and just indented the center of the line. when i used the bead of polish i got perfect lines. mind you i am an ameture and new at this. it came well packaged and had no problems, cam WAYYYY earlier than expected which was perfect because i am impatient. they&#x27;re cheap but sturdy which is all i really needed!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do nails but these are very tiny, and sometimes I need a very fine line. Very nice.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE BRUSHES THAT I NEED, to do perfect designs i am very pleased with the quality. thank you.</li>
    <li> I received the brush set in 7 days. :-) But the paint on the wooden handles comes off easily. I picked up a brush with a small bit of polish remover on my fingers and the brown paint came off immediately. Also, there isn&#x27;t a size difference between the brushes as shown in the photos. Even thought the set is cheap, I would&#x27;nt buy them again.</li>
    <li> They arrived rather quickly. That&#x27;s always a plus right? Packaging was fine. Another plus. Sadly one of my brushes arrived broken but the seller emailed me back right away when i filed a complaint and seemed willing enough to figure out a solution. But it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me, not like I paid an arm and a leg for it, so I&#x27;m content to just keep the 2 non-broken ones and go about my life ;)</li>
    <li> I recently bought these brushes for $1.15, I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy or in cute cases. Just something quality and simple. I&#x27;m incredibly happy with these brushes and have no complaints at all. I have done a flower and a polka dot pattern so far. I&#x27;ve only used the shortest, it provided great details and was easy to control. I am looking forward to trying more patterns as the summer gets closer. Mine arrived in perfect condition in a plastic bag with small plastic caps. This was a great (and inexpensive) investment for my nail kit! I don&#x27;t see any reason I&#x27;d need any other brushes besides these 3.</li>
    <li> I used these as soon as i got them, love the tiny size of the tip and the large handle is comfortable. Cant beat the price, i got two sets! :-)&lt;br /&gt;-Lady Alayna</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes, easy to use.  They provide great detail for nail art and clean up easily.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It arrived on time and undamaged.  The bristles look good.  Not trimming neccessary.  It has a little plastic protictive tip that protects it while shipping.  You can re-use this to keep the tips in good shape.  Or you can just use a regular drinking straw for storage.</li>
    <li> The price was right and the quality is good. This is a nice addition to my finger nail decorating bag of tricks.</li>
    <li> Very good condition, brushes seem high quality and there were no defects.</li>
    <li> My daughter love them</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the quality of these brushes</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ll get the job done (barely), but just very cheap. The quality just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> The brush part fell off the handle. I guess you get what you pay for :(</li>
    <li> Works great, my son loved them.  He has been painting on canvas shoes and they work great for fine details.  Just ordered 2more sets.</li>
    <li> Excellent great for eyebrows.Thanks</li>
    <li> Great tools to have. Shipped on time</li>
    <li> Dotting tools are ok, but I wish it had at least one large dot. They all seemed small and kind of the same size.</li>
    <li> good brushes for starters.</li>
    <li> these started to fall apart after the first use! i dipped the brush in the nail polish and when i went to swipe on my finger, the bristles came out! so much for that.</li>
    <li> Bristles came out after couple uses and brush much larger in person.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes everything I expected</li>
    <li> I think they&#x27;re pretty well made for the price. I destroy them after long use anyways so I&#x27;d definitely purchase again. These have lasted a long time after many dips in acetone. They&#x27;re a good size for small detail.</li>
    <li> Got here pretty quickly, considering they came from China, and are pretty good brushes.</li>
    <li> These seem to work well on nails</li>
    <li> Took forever to reach my house, the brushes aren&#x27;t even that good, stray hairs everywhere.</li>
    <li> Used these once and they fell apart. I haven&#x27;t tried to reglue them yet. I will do so eventually.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for detail work. Fast shipping.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Nail brushes arrived after approximately 20 days in a padded envelope, but one of them was broken. Not happy about that, but seeing that the price was relatively low, duct tape did the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with these brushes. They&#x27;re small enough to do intricate designs on my nails, which is exactly what I was hoping for. I&#x27;ve used them several times already, and the brushes are not so firm that the polish is difficult to apply. They&#x27;re just soft enough so that I can make smooth, fine lines with both fingernail polish and acrylic paint. Clean up is easy and so far has not damaged my brushes or caused them to lose their shape. They were delivered early and packaged with plastic on the brushes--protecting them from any sort of damage during shipping. Great product, awesome price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember purchasing this set, but I am giving it a review nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;They look really interesting.  Perhaps someone else received the package and I&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t opened it.</li>
    <li> Brushes are constructed out of good materials and have a nice finish, but the tips are not as tight as I would have hoped for extremely detailed painting.</li>
    <li> when nail polish remover touches these the black paint on the brush comes off on your hand and is very hard to get off</li>
    <li> i used them one time and im not sure how to get the dried nail polish off. it doesn&#x27;t really make clean lines</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive. Black paint comes off handle if you get nail polish remover on it which makes an annoying mess. Something for beginners to practice with before buying nicer ones.</li>
    <li> the product itself was pretty good and did the job, but the shipping was terribly slow. It took me more than half a month to receive the product.</li>
    <li> I think ima really love theses because now i can do all can of art work plus it was a good deal !</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail and there were not broken they were perfectly fine i mean you get what you get for the price you pay for..I wouldn&#x27;t use them as nail brushes i would use them as lip brushes cause they work better for that.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality and isnt good for my design needs... also it comes from china and took forever to get here and it wasnt worth the wait.. they feel good in the hand but didnt brush on the design as i hoped it would...eh at least they were cheap.</li>
    <li> Easy to use for nail art and I recommend to everyone who is doing nail art or even learning to do nail art to purchase thse it will help out..</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for fine nail art, the handles are a nice size and make it easier to control your line. I like them</li>
    <li> Great varity there are small brushes and diffrent uses for all. daughter likes them she can use them for all her nail art</li>
    <li> Tiny brushes but good quality . I was surprised.  Very fine and think I will use them , some of them anyway for painting detail work in my oil paintings.  Good for eyeliner and such also.</li>
    <li> Two out of three brushes came bent and immediately broke when I tried to straighten them with very little force. I would definitely not call these &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; grade, by any means. They do get you a pretty clean line and are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get them. But I love them.</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever !!!! Good quality</li>
    <li> The brushes come off from the stick</li>
    <li> When I used the brushes the nail polish wouldn&#x27;t be a solid color. The color was weak and the brushes didn&#x27;t work. The detailer was to thick. I tried to make a zebra design but it didnt work. the lines were to thick. Also the paint on the handle came off when i had nail polish remover on my hands. The brush part kept falling off. TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY!!! Wish I didnt waste money on this.</li>
    <li> No issues. Pretty good quality especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Good purchase for being the first time i buy nail brushes i enjoyed playing with them and trying them out so far good !</li>
    <li> I wish it would have a nice cary bag or something. I like them. I am happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;Came on time and nicely packaged. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are okay. Something about them doesn&#x27;t just wow me, but over all they are fine. The handles are large and easy to hang onto.</li>
    <li> They worked for a little bit, but the tips kept falling off. Just added some glue n then they were fine.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to be able to do zebra stripes but da brush would open up I guess I can use it for sum other design</li>
    <li> Really good I love them. They are worth the buy even though it isn&#x27;t even that much! I really enjoy them and they make decoratibg my nails easier!:)</li>
    <li> The ppl are trying to help me the best they can they are verry nice i will buy more soon if they fix my issue</li>
    <li> I really did like this product and it came on time too and it was just how they said it would be</li>
    <li> precise lines on the nails.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I ordered and I will be sure to recommend your company to my friends. Keep up the great service.!!!!!</li>
    <li> They work really well. if you paint, these are well worth it for the designs on nails. Try them for yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought these three brushes to do intricate nail art (i&#x27;m a bit obsessed with nail polish) and they are great. The thin, short hairs make it really easy to get a fine, precise line. they came perfectly on time nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality and hard Brissles. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> these are very cheaply made. the color on the handles rub right off and the bristles fall out first time you use them.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the performance of these brushes. It is very easy to hold and maneuver. New style for my nails.</li>
