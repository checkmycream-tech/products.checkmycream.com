<ol>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found the style to be perfect for both beach trip or an evening</li>
      <li>awesome</li>
      <li>All in all, still an awesome buy!</li>
      <li>Makes the perfect beach wave!</li>
      <li>THE BEST PURCHASE I HAVE MADE.</li>
      <li>then this is the perfect appliance for you!  </li>
      <li>It worked great on my remy extensions too!</li>

      <li>So Happy!</li>
      <li>Very happy</li>
      <li>and it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>As others have mentioned, the Wrap to Waves Styler works best on longer hair, and when used, it gives the hair a bit of definition.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s best for shoulder to blades length ...</li>
      <li>I am not a stylist but have used all sorts of tools and this one works great!  </li>
      <li>SO GOOD!</li>
      <li>Wrapping your hair around the barrels in a figure 8 creates beautiful natural-looking waves -- not at all like the too-perfectly-proportioned ones a waving iron creates.</li>
      <li>This does create some beautiful looking hair.  </li>
      <li>If you have the time to learn to use this styler, then I do recommend it as it produces beautiful curls.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For those of you who are hairdressing savvy and coordinated this would probably be a great tool.</li>
      <li>I can see this iron working great.</li>
      <li>Really great price as well.</li>
      <li>settings are great.</li>
      <li>However, I decided to risk it and have ended up extremely happy with it.</li>
      <li>and you get great results</li>
      <li>Very nice, with great curls.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll have perfect waves :)</li>

      <li>The 2 times came out really good</li>
      <li>and I found it on Amazon (at a good price).  </li>
      <li>I like this product for special occasions since it takes some time to get those perfect results.  </li>
      <li>and when I saw her, she looked so adorable, precious and wonderful.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that amazing but good for its price,burned my face twice until I got the technique</li>
      <li>The glove was a very wise addition to this product, making it even more safe to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>love this product for the days i want a bed head look .!</li>
      <li>This styling tool works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>kind of hair</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t have the time required to achieve results with this item.</li>
      <li>The ends of the hair just kind of jut out.  </li>
      <li>The seller came through and delivered the item on time and it arrived in good condition (met my expectations :) ).</li>
      <li>and it works awesome but has a very steep learning curve that took me a while to get used to.</li>
      <li>I suppose auto shutoff is nice, but I haven&#x27;t used it...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gives really nice definition to hair.</li>
      <li>It does wave your hair and it does look nice</li>
      <li>Nice assistant for women</li>
      <li>These types of styling products are really catching on.</li>
      <li>Some women can braid their own hair by themselves, and some can&#x27;t (even the ones who think they can).  </li>
      <li>Product was brand new and serves its purpose greatly!</li>
      <li>It creates an interesting beachy wave that I love!</li>
      <li>otherwise it is an amazing product and i love the results.</li>
      <li>Fair price compared with salon styling for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I burned my hand the first couple times I was trying to figure out how to use it, but it&#x27;s definitely a great purchase.</li>
      <li>For me, this turned out to be one of those products that sounds to good to be true - in my case, it was.</li>
      <li>However, when I used it on my daughter, my two hands free and being able to see what I was doing, I was super happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>i love this</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s growing her hair out and hopes to be able to use it soon.</li>
      <li>I tried this out on my sister&#x27;s hair, and that worked out much better.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I always love curls in my hair, and have been debating whether or not to perm my hair.</li>
      <li>Well, if you are hoping for Swift-like magic on your tresses from the Remington Wrap To Waves, your hopes will be dashed unless you are a hair wizard.</li>
      <li>It does take some getting used to, and I find that if I DON&#x27;T look in the mirror, I do better.</li>
      <li>But this gives me waves that just get better as the days go on.</li>
      <li>so my results may be better with this type of styler than others with shorter hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not many.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
      <li>but once I got the hang of it, I have been able to style my hair in about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>you use this type of product, make sure you also have some hair protector on-hand or over time it can burn your hair.</li>
      <li>I then googled the styler to find out more.</li>
      <li>I love this waver.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m already in love with it.</li>
      <li>im beyond im love</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure that without the glove, I and my daughter would have been burned.  </li>
      <li>I have layered hair that is maybe 3 inches passed the top of my shoulders.  </li>
      <li>Overall though, great product!</li>
      <li>So i decided to return it and try my luck one more time but that bit me in the romp.</li>
      <li>I love the body it gives my hair.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Supposedly you can watch a video online - and it may have more instructions.  </li>
      <li>I had been using a clamp-type waver and was hesitant to switch but am so glad I took a chance on this.</li>
      <li>i absolutly love this wand.</li>
      <li>I am thinking about replacing the glove that came with it with a better quality one.</li>
      <li>I love the way my hair curls with this wand, but i have already bought 2 of these, and they both stopped heating up after about 3-6 months.</li>
      <li>She was able to wrap a bit of her hair around it, but I guess the effect would be more pronounced had she longer hair.  </li>
      <li>that I know of.  :-)  </li>
      <li>If you have hair that is shorter than shoulder length, don&#x27;t buy this product as you will not be able to use it.</li>
      <li>Love love love this product.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this styler, but it exceeded my expectations.  </li>
      <li>I love the look.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you use the glove they give you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My better half likes a nice wave now and then, and it always looks good. Her long healthy hair looks wonderful in any condition, even bedhead (but try telling her that). So she tried this curling iron, and she&#x27;s put in some lovely waves that have lasted a few days quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was, um, rather odd to come into the bathroom and see her with one black glove on, and I figured she&#x27;d finally decided to strangle me, an admittedly not unreasonable thought. But, merciful fate, she was only practicing her moonwalking while wearing the glove enclosed with this kit. Because the prongs get verrry hot, so be careful! She said to mention that this iron works best for long hair only, and is a little trickier to use than she&#x27;d prefer. Tricky plus super hot minus total concentration equals burns. An equation to be wary of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I for one like the outcome, and it&#x27;s sure quicker and cheaper and uses less chemicals than any salon, so if your sweetie likes the occasional wave and has no immediate plans to do you in, this would be a fine xmas gift.</li>
    <li> Wand stylers are all the rage in salons these days and now I understand why. As most people have said, it does take a little practice the first time to get accustomed to using a curling wand. There are pretty clear directions and illustrations to show you how to wrap your hair around the wand using a figure 8 technique. Because there is no mechanism to secure your hair, your hand requires a protective glove, which is included with the wand. This is a basic thick cotton glove that can easily be replaced if you misplace or lose it. Once you get used to the process, it actually goes pretty quickly and the results are amazing! I had been using a clamp-type waver and was hesitant to switch but am so glad I took a chance on this. After seeing the results with this, I won&#x27;t go back to my old waver. I do have long hair so my results may be better with this type of styler than others with shorter hair.  If you are looking for professional styling results,this is a great choice. Just be prepared to spend a little extra time getting used to the technique (which is why I gave this 4 stars and not 5). You may not want to spend the extra time using this every day but for a special occasion or when you want that \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; look, this is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> My sister tried this out for me.  She has hair down to her shoulders, but thinks that it would work better if her hair was longer.  She was able to wrap a bit of her hair around it, but I guess the effect would be more pronounced had she longer hair.  Other than that, it seems to work well, and heated quickly.  She burned her hands a few times though that&#x27;s her fault and not a flaw of the iron.  It took a bit of time too, so she thinks it would be better as a once in awhile thing, and not an everyday tool.</li>
    <li> I heard about the wrap to waves hair styler via Twitter. I then googled the styler to find out more. From what I found, it seemed pretty cool. When I recieved the iron I watched a \\&quot;how to\\&quot; video on You Tube and went to town. I love the iron and the way it adds so much volume to my hair. The only problem is you must wear a styling glove when using it. It also takes some getting used to, a different technique is used and you have to practice a few times before you get your desired results!</li>
    <li> The young woman i gave this too said she like the design, the instructions were pretty clean and she thought it was easy to use.  It is flexible with lots of heat settings and it heats up in 30 seconds - that&#x27;s fast!  Only thing is that her chin length hair is too short for it to be very effective.  She&#x27;s growing her hair out and hopes to be able to use it soon.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very difficult to use.  Despite having long hair, this product didn&#x27;t work for my hair because it&#x27;s layered.  I can imagine that it might be a useful tool for someone with long, straight, unlayered hair.  This tool also left my hair extra dry and somewhat frizzy.  I immediately washed my hair after trying to use this - to get rid of the strange waves and frizz that it created.  For me, this turned out to be one of those products that sounds to good to be true - in my case, it was.</li>
    <li> This does create some beautiful looking hair.  But, I found it really hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My arms usually get tired when curling my hair with my normal curling iron, but they got tired much quicker using this.  Seemed like I just started using it and my arms were complaining.  Maybe it&#x27;s the way I need to hold the iron?  I don&#x27;t know.  It also took a long, long time to get all of my hair done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finished product is really very pretty.  I love the look.  I just can&#x27;t see using this very frequently.  I tried this out on my sister&#x27;s hair, and that worked out much better.  I found it a lot easier to use on someone else&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worthwhile if you like the look and have some extra time to use it.  I think I&#x27;ll be using it just for special occasions, though.</li>
    <li> Although my wife has hair that is shoulder length she wanted to give this unit a try. It will certainly save some dollars for a decent wave rather than going to a salon; however, the thickness of the barrels and the distance between the rods makes it difficult or impossible for hair that is not at least 2 or 3 inches below the shoulder. If Remington made one like Conair&#x27;s YOU Wrap and Wave Ceramic Styler, where the rods are not as thick, and are also closer together, that might be what the shoulder length crowd is looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit didn&#x27;t heat up as quickly as my wife would like.  She is on the go and needs it right now, or better yet, yesterday. But when it does heat, it heats nicely enough to get the job done (if her hair was long enough), and the glove provided with the styler does keep one from being burned.</li>
    <li> Yikes this thing is awkward to use unless you have more than 2 hands to help. Since humans normally only come with two hands, you&#x27;ll have to enlist the aid of a friend unless you can somehow become a contortionist or something. Especially hard when trying to use it on the back of the head where it is difficult to see, if at all. Not user friendly for sure, so it will probably wind up with the pile of unused items that just aren&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and on the fourth day it stopped working. So i decided to return it and try my luck one more time but that bit me in the romp. After only five minutes of curling my hair the iron went cold. I went around the house plugging it into different outlets but the irons still would not get hot. I would not reccomend this product to anyone. Although it is on the cheaper side it makes more sense to purchase a more expensive item that will last you a very long time :)</li>
    <li> I got this product for my daughter who has very straight, long, thick hair.  It was great!  It has 13 different heat settings that begin at L (for low, I guess), 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, all the way to 30. These wide variety of heat settings allows you to choose how tight you want the curls to be, depending on how dry your hair is.  For example, when hair is completely dry, the low heat setting, usually 10 or 12.5, was enough to make tight curls that lasted the amount of time she was in school (sometimes more than 8 because of extracurricular activities!). (This is in low humidity situations.)  She uses a heat protective leave-in conditioner after toweling her hair dry, then blow dries her hair to either almost dry or dry. To get more curls, we choose fewer/thinner strands of hair to curl and wind them around in figure 8&#x27;s on the 2 barrels, choosing the higher heat settings.  This also gives tighter curls that look as if they&#x27;re naturally curly.  To just make her hair look wavy, we get thicker strands of hair and use the medium heat settings. Her individual hair strands are thin, so we only leave the hair on a maximum of 20 seconds, sometimes less to get wavy hair, so the hair doesn&#x27;t get that damaged dry look that we sometimes get when we use too much heat. We always use the glove that goes with this, so we don&#x27;t actually know how hot the hair gets. The glove was a very wise addition to this product, making it even more safe to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat we&#x27;ve found is that when hair is shoulder length, it&#x27;s harder to wind the hair on both barrels.  My daughter had a haircut recently, and we found that the 2nd barrel could actually get in the way when your hair is not that long.  She says it was a good thing there was that glove, because I don&#x27;t know how many times she had her fingers accidentally touch the other barrel and felt the heat through the glove.  So we&#x27;ve ended up holding the iron horizontally at right angles with the hair (instead of vertically or in linewith long hair) so only the one barrel could be used easily. It takes more time, though, to curl shorter hair because the 2nd barrel is getting in the way, but the results are still the same. All in all, still an awesome buy!</li>
    <li> Overall I really like this product.  I have wanted a curling wand for several months but never had the money for the brand I was eyeing, this is a decent substitute.  I have layered hair that is maybe 3 inches passed the top of my shoulders.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with using this and I also don&#x27;t style my hair very often so it isn&#x27;t that I&#x27;m a pro already.  I didn&#x27;t like the look of my hair after weaving it around both rods so I just use one instead and it came out great, though it took some getting used to having to bypass the second rod.  I added a picture.  I will definitely use this on a regular basis.  I love the body it gives my hair.  I have color-treated straight fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold much of a curl after the first hour, but the style I created actually stayed in my hair all evening and night, until bed.  It took about 20-25 minutes the first time to do my entire head.  I am right handed thus hold the styler with my right hand and it makes curling the right side of my head a little more cumbersome.  The glove takes getting used to when sectioning your hair while wearing it but it is necessary.  I am thinking about replacing the glove that came with it with a better quality one.</li>
    <li> ...your hair has to be pretty long to use it.  This curling iron is different than traditional curling irons as you wrap your hair around it in a figure 8.  If your hair is short, the process is MUCH harder, if not downright impossible.  I like how hot it got (must use the glove or get burnt fingers!) and the curls seemed to hold well.  If you have hair that is shorter than shoulder length, don&#x27;t buy this product as you will not be able to use it.</li>
    <li> I say this after my wife used this to style her hair to welcome me back home and when I saw her, she looked so adorable, precious and wonderful.  Not guaranteeing you&#x27;ll get the same results...just saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women have a variety of ways to style their hair and doing \\&quot;waves\\&quot; is a style that can be done many different ways.  If time is short on your side, the assist of a heated hair styler to achieve a certain effect, can go a long way.  My wife finds it easy to use and I&#x27;d imagine this is akin to braiding hair for women.  Some women can braid their own hair by themselves, and some can&#x27;t (even the ones who think they can).  Nice assistant for women I think.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping for some easy, beachy waves. And while it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected at first, It was simple to figure out and the waves really did last.&lt;br /&gt;On myself it needed a little more dexterity, especially for reaching the back. There is no &#x27;clamp&#x27; portion to hold the hair, so you have to use the heat resistant glove and hold your hair slightly taut while reaching behind your head in order to wave it. However, when I used it on my daughter, my two hands free and being able to see what I was doing, I was super happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;For the price and ease of use I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Long hair is definitely required for this styler.  I have medium length hair and it just wasn&#x27;t long enough to wrap around the two bars of the styler.  I had my daughter try it and after much practice, she finally got the technique down, and her hair looked fabulous.  Once she got used to it, she was able to create curls on her entire head quickly.  It comes with a heat glove and you will definitely want to use it.  Wrapping the hair around each bar puts your hand dangerously close to the heat and I&#x27;m sure that without the glove, I and my daughter would have been burned.  If you have the time to learn to use this styler, then I do recommend it as it produces beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> I figured the protective glove would actually be... I don&#x27;t know... protective? It&#x27;s just a regular thin glove, and you can&#x27;t touch the styling iron for more than a second or two or it burns anyway. That said, I forged ahead and attempted to get the bouncy waves promised to me by the ads...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, medium texture hair. I blew it dry and then used this styler to try to make it wavy. It was tricky to use and I felt very awkward trying to get my hair wrapped all the way around in figure 8s. I did the best I could, in approximately 1 inch sections as it advises, and what I ended up with was just weirdly inconsistent, sort of \\&quot;bent\\&quot; hair that looked like a combo of bedhead and windblown beachy. Not at all attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this whole double-prong thing is a new trend, but I don&#x27;t get it. Maybe if I spent hours fooling around with this trying to get it juuuust right, I might end up with more consistent waves, but I don&#x27;t have that kind of time to waste, and I&#x27;m not convinced the end result would be anything special anyway. Back to conventional curling irons for me.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. I have a curling rod that leaves me with pretty waves. This is just too much work. If you only use it on special occasions or have a friend to do your hair for you, it may be worth it. For everyday styling, it just takes too long. I have long fine hair. With the right styling products, I can get decent results that last most of the day. I just wish it was easier. Make sure you use the glove they give you. It make it harder to work with the hair but you&#x27;ll burn your hand without it. If you don&#x27;t believe me, try to work your hair around the rods before turning it &amp; see how often you bump your hand or fingers.</li>
    <li> I Ordered this on 27th Feb 2013 under Order #102-8518094-3157812. This Item I have Used for 3 times till now and while using it for the 4th time it was not heating up the device. It Has 2 Years of Warranty but before completing the year itself it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to return this shipment for warranty claim.&lt;br /&gt;kindly suggest me the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Thanks.</li>
    <li> This hair styler takes a little getting used to- a word of warning, don&#x27;t go without using the heat proof glove! I guess I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with it, I wasn&#x27;t disgusted with it either- I felt somewhere in the middle. I think I&#x27;ll probably stick with my regular curling iron if I want a few curls and the hot rollers if I want lots of curl. This twin wand gives waves, not curl. As the day goes on, you can&#x27;t really tell the waves are still there.  There isn&#x27;t a way to curl the ends of the hair, that part I felt was unattractive and is the main reason why I&#x27;ll probably go back to a regular curling iron. The ends of the hair just kind of jut out.  I&#x27;m a practical woman, if I&#x27;m going to expend the time to curl my hair I&#x27;d like it to be curly with a visible result, all the way down the hair length. I&#x27;m not looking to basically waste time with a half hearted result. However, if you want a wavy result and don&#x27;t care that the ends are every which way- then this is the perfect appliance for you!  You do need long hair to use this, keep that in mind when deciding if it will work for you or not. Maybe it would be a nice product for a woman with naturally curly hair who wanted to straighten it out some for some loose waves...?</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about yet another curling iron type device that promised beachy waves, but this thing is pretty great. I have a waver, but the waves were too small and summery for my liking. This thing gave my natural thin straight hair great voluminous waves. I burned my hand the first couple times I was trying to figure out how to use it, but it&#x27;s definitely a great purchase. It worked great on my remy extensions too! I would definitely recommend this product for any one looking for loose beachy waves!</li>
    <li> I love this!  The reviews that say it is hard to use must not use hair tools.  I am not a stylist but have used all sorts of tools and this one works great!  It takes a few tries to get the hang of it (the opposite of the mirror thing in the begining) but once you do it is really quick to use.  I have long hair and can wave all my hair in less than 10 min.  The only dumb thing about this product is the heat glove it comes with. There is no way to grab a section of hair with it on.  Loose the glove from the beginging and you will love this tool!</li>
    <li> [NOTE: I have only used this curling iron on my own hair, which was slightly longer than shoulder-length at the time. I think that this iron may be better/easier to use for someone with much longer hair] The design of the Remington CI52FO Wrap to Waves Ceramic Hair Styler makes it more difficult to use than it should be. The iron works fine: has adjustable heat settings, heats up quickly, includes a heat-resistant glove to protect your hair-wrapping hand. However, unless your hair is very long (i.e. well past your shoulders), the barrels are too close together to easily maneuver a section of hair between them. And, the figure-8 styling method suggested by Remington may work for super-long hair, but I was only able to produce \\&quot;waves\\&quot; that were kinky and odd-looking.  If your hair is shorter than halfway down your back, I would suggest sticking with a clamp-free iron that is single-barrel.</li>
    <li> I really love this styler! It creates the waves I&#x27;ve been try to get for so long! It does take some getting used to and a little trial and error to find out how to use it for your hair, but once you do, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the \\&quot;perm\\&quot; look but could never get it down right. This curler gives a great wavy look which is consistent, long lasting, and mistake proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for long hair. I have no problems curling my waist length long hair with this. No need to do lower half of hair then upper half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat settings are great. Worked fine for my thin, stick straight hair. Results were long lasting until next shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives really nice definition to hair. Makes hair voluminous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the style to be perfect for both beach trip or an evening date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight. Always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short learning curve to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not many. Major complaint would be the cheap glove it came with that still gets me burned sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must get used to fact that this is a larger/wider iron. I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times from getting one of barrels too close to face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prob would not work well for short hair. Remington should make a smaller version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little difficult to work back of head but can be overcome with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for anyone who&#x27;s got carpal tunnel, rsi, etc. Figure 8&#x27;ing will be hell for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price, gets the job done, gives you the look promised. Try it!</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair curls with this wand, but i have already bought 2 of these, and they both stopped heating up after about 3-6 months. I am tired of having to return it, but it did work great on my hair.  I just wish it wouldn&#x27;t die on me.</li>
    <li> This curling device is a little tricky to figure out at first.  Watching the video and then putting yourself in front of the mirror can be a real test in dexterity!  It heats up fast and is quite light weight.  I was worried about it tipping forward onto the barrels (and burning my counter) but there are little stands on the barrel tips to keep that from happening.  I have medium thick semi-fine hair that&#x27;s just past shoulder length and I can not use this (both barrels) for most of my hair or it comes out looking like I have bad bed-head.  I end up wrapping my hair around one of the barrels instead, which pretty much defeats the purpose entirely!  On the longer sections in the back I can use both barrels and it creates a wave that has sharp edges at first, and then relaxes (but without a strong styling product it looks sloppy).  I use CHI protectant because this is very hot and potentially damaging.  One more thing - the glove takes a little getting used to and is large. For anyone wondering, the outside measurement across the 2 barrels is about 2 1/8th inches, with approx 3/4 inch gap in between.</li>
    <li> Finally!!! Something I really  needed. I have extra extra long hair and this is a God send!!  Warning!! It gets really hot so use the glove and go slow at first.  I was concerned it might burn my hair or split the ends but it hasnt.  This is fun to use and I can sit down and curl my hair  My hair is course and thick but the curls hold better than the old type styler</li>
    <li> My wife has medium-long hair (maybe an inch or two past her shoulders), so she had trouble using this product. She did like the fact that the waves set in quickly, but did caution for people to be careful because the styler gets very, very hot. Direct quote: \\&quot;You must use the glove or you will be sorry.\\&quot; It can take a little getting used to, and she suggests to watch some Youtube videos beforehand, if you don&#x27;t have experience working with one of these things. Lastly, she says that you should use some sort of hair protection product, otherwise this will damage your hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe I need more practice but this thing is hard to use. I honestly don&#x27;t have the time required to achieve results with this item. I&#x27;ll take a regular curling iron over this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and after trying it several times and watching a few how-to videos on You Tube, I have determined that it probably works only if you have very long hair. My hair is medium-long (about 2\\&quot; past my shoulders) and I&#x27;m really not able to get enough hair wrapped around the tool to create the types of waves I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Pros: Heats up fast.  I suppose auto shutoff is nice, but I haven&#x27;t used it...that I know of.  :-)  Lots of heat settings for different hair types and thicknesses.  Daughter&#x27;s hair stays wavy all day without going limp.  She says it makes her hair luxurious, and I agree.  That alone makes it worth the purchase for me. Fair price compared with salon styling for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Gets extremely hot (hence the included glove) so use caution, especially if purchasing for a young person.  Must have longer hair.  My hair--below the shoulder length--is too short, but my daughter&#x27;s hair is longer, so it worked better.  Time-consuming.  Takes practice and a few watches of the video on YouTube.</li>
    <li> The Remington Wrap to Waves Ceramic Hair Styler produces a pretty result, shiny waves with as much curl on the ends as you want.  It takes some practice to get the technique down just so, though, some trial-and-error, if you&#x27;re using the styler on our own hair.  It isn&#x27;t as easy as just whirling a curling iron through your hair.  I think it would be super-easy if you were using this on someone else&#x27;s hair, because in that case, you don&#x27;t have to rely on a mirror to see where you&#x27;re working, and because after a while, this styler can get a little heavy if you have a lot of hair and/or longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are no clamp marks or \\&quot;fish hooks\\&quot; left behind on the hair from using this styler.  It achieves a very pretty deep wave that looks natural and more life-like than the deep-wave crimping irons from back in the day.  With practice, you&#x27;ll get faster, and will know how to wrap your hair around the rods to get the effect you&#x27;re looking for, but it does take a little more practice than your average curling iron.</li>
    <li> I recieved this item in the mail yesterday and used it as soon as i opened it! i absolutly love this wand. It took me about 30 mins to do my whole head (and i have alot of long thick hair) it was way easier than curling. I would highly recommend this wand. Im not sure how it would work with shorter hair though.</li>
    <li> I have notoriously difficult hair to curl, as it&#x27;s extra-fine and stick-straight.  So, looking at the beautiful curls on the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few complaints, mainly about the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, it doesn&#x27;t tell you how long it should heat up, how long to keep it attached, how to take your hair out of it, or how long it takes to cool down.  It doesn&#x27;t tell you what to do with the end of your hair - I figured out that I could hold it on the non-hot parts at the ends, so my fingers could rest without burning (even with the glove on, it&#x27;s hot) ... but then the end doesn&#x27;t curl.  Is there a technique for this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the curl itself, I am no expert but I don&#x27;t look at all like the girl on the box.  I look like I would if I pulled all my hair into two buns while wet, let them dry, and then let it out. Not very curly but with much more body. Because the ends don&#x27;t tuck in like they do on a regular curling iron, the ends are not curled.  I could achieve the same effect with a regular curling iron or curlers and save myself the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the operation, I can say that it is not at all easy to do the back of your head.  This is probably true with any device, but I find it easier with curlers.  You also want to have really long hair.  I recently cut mine so it is only 4 inches beyond my shoulders.  I didn&#x27;t get a lot of mile-age hair-wise - you don&#x27;t want it too close to your hair or face because it&#x27;s big - and hot.  I wish they gave you gloves for both hands because sometimes you want to use the other hand and you have to remember not to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly you can watch a video online - and it may have more instructions.  I have two thoughts on this. First, if I&#x27;m in the bathroom curling my hair, I&#x27;m not on my computer watching a video. Secondly, why not include a styling DVD with the product? perhaps they will do that on the final product - I had a demo version for review.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that&#x27;s already wavy, but I&#x27;m trying to get a smoother, more styled look. This took forever to use on my whole head and the end result was exactly the same as if I&#x27;d let my hair air dry, only without the volume. Although the product is inexpensive, don&#x27;t waste your money. I would definitely suggest investing in a single barrel styling wand - the results are fantastic and style time is about 10 mins (I use a T3 SinglePass Whirl Styling Wand). Pricier but worth it if you plan to use it often!</li>
    <li> Makes great waves that last pretty much all day!&lt;br /&gt;What kind of hair do I have?&lt;br /&gt;Relaxed and dyed 3C.</li>
    <li> Very nice, with great curls.</li>
    <li> love this product for the days i want a bed head look .!</li>
    <li> awesome im beyond im love super happy super excited super comfortable</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes the perfect beach wave!</li>
    <li> this iron was only $15 !! what a steal !!!  this is one of my favorite curlers i own about 15+ and this one is by far one of the best for beachy waves i almost want to get a second one as a back up. Is that crazy?</li>
    <li> This tool takes a little patience to figure out how to use, but once you get the hang out it, it is easy to manipulate. The only downside is you have to have long hair to use this tool. This tool does not work well with medium- to short- length hair. If you have long hair, the tool creates beautiful beach(y) waves.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but i decided to buy it anyways. THE BEST PURCHASE I HAVE MADE. I have medium to long hair and it only takes about 30 minutes to give me some great looking waves for a night out. Love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her curling iron. She loves the type of curls and how her hair looks. Very quick arrival.</li>
    <li> This is the only tool that gives me realistic looking beach waves. I have very long (waist length), fine hair. My hair is straight as a board and does not hold anything well.  But this gives me waves that just get better as the days go on. I wash my hair every night, so I cannot attest to how well the waves hold up over multiple days. It does take some getting used to, and I find that if I DON&#x27;T look in the mirror, I do better. If I look in the  mirror, I just get all tangled up and go the wrong way. You HAVE to use the heat glove or you will burn the crap out of yourself. But if you use the glove, you can actually do it without looking in the mirror and use feeling to get it around the thing the right way. You just cannot touch it for very long even with the glove on or you will burn yourself. But yeah, I would totally order it again. My mom ordered one and could not figure out how to use it, but she also has shoulder length hair. I imagine it would be hard to use on short hair.</li>
    <li> This works great for long hair!  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work very long.  We have purchased two, and they both stopped heating up after only a few uses (a couple months).  We were able to return the first one, but didn&#x27;t realize soon enough that the second one had stopped working.  It&#x27;s a little expensive for a disposable curling device.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that amazing but good for its price,burned my face twice until I got the technique so be careful &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I always love curls in my hair, and have been debating whether or not to perm my hair. Using single barrel curling irons, or rollers, just don&#x27;t work for me. The curl never lasts, and my hair is left looking fried and frizzy. I found this curler and decided to give it a try. I LOVE it. My curls are always perfect - loose, wavy curls that last for days! I all never need another curling iron (or perm)!</li>
    <li> it is hard to use even with long hair. I didn&#x27;t listen to the comments when it said it was hard to use without long hair, and I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t work for me either. I tried it many different ways and all of it makes me look like i woke up with bed head. I should have kept the box and sent it back. It&#x27;s a cool idea, but not for me.</li>
    <li> My hair is just past my shoulders, and I agree with the other reviews that says it would probably work better with longer hair.  This product really takes a few tries to get used to. The figure 8 motion can be hard to master (especially while looking in the mirror!) and if I do not wrap my hair tight enough around the barrel I get a funky kink in my hair that is not attractive at all.  That all being said, this product does give great volume to hair and does give it subtle waves. Although you could probably achieve similar results by wrapping hair around a curling iron.. all you would need is a glove.  All in all I like this product for special occasions since it takes some time to get those perfect results.  NOTE: I am not a girl that does my hair often... I am a \\&quot;scrunch it and go\\&quot; type of person. Curling irons have never been my friend. If you are one that is more skilled at styling your hair everyday, I think this product would be perfect for you!</li>
    <li> WORKS SO GOOD! I was looking for something to get that &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; look and this works perfectly! At first your hair looks a bit crimpy but give it a few days and you&#x27;ll have perfect waves :) Also, it takes about 5 minutes to wrap/wave your whole head!</li>
    <li> i love this and it works awesome but has a very steep learning curve that took me a while to get used to. i have shoulder blade length hair and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who have short hair and if you are used to useing both your hands buy a second glove. otherwise it is an amazing product and i love the results.</li>
    <li> I just got this today and I&#x27;m already in love with it. It took a little getting used to but once you do it&#x27;s simple and easy. The glove is much better quality than the ones I got with my other curling wands. Really great price as well.</li>
    <li> This Iron is fantastic. I&#x27;ve had several of my clients buy one.  I now have red carpet waves and use it everyday.  Just keep thinking Figure 8 as you curl your hair and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it! So Happy!</li>
    <li> I heard about this styling tool and watched a few tutorials on YouTube before I bought it. I would recommend doing this so that you can see how to use the tool as well as how your hair will turn out when finished. I read other people&#x27;s reviews too and was a little nervous about buying it since many people said theirs broke within the first couple of uses. However, I decided to risk it and have ended up extremely happy with it. I have used it at least 7 or 8 times now and it has been working just fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit tricky to use the first time but once I got the hang of it, I have been able to style my hair in about 30 minutes. The glove that comes with it is really helpful for weaving your hair between the two prongs without burning your fingers. The other great thing is that this styler isn&#x27;t meant to make your hair look &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; so you can get away with doing larger chunks of hair and at a quicker pace (if that makes sense). I love how this makes my hair look!</li>
    <li> Easy to use after a little practice. Waves last couple of days even in my fine long hair. Very happy</li>
    <li> Have you ever looked at Taylor Swift and said, \\&quot;God, I can&#x27;t stand her but what would it be like to have her hair?\\&quot; (admit: I am guilty!) Well, if you are hoping for Swift-like magic on your tresses from the Remington Wrap To Waves, your hopes will be dashed unless you are a hair wizard. I kept on looking at this unit with trepidation: I needed a glove and hair skills of wrapping and twisting my locks into a figure-eight over two heated barrels to achieve said waves. Well, the only thing I ever crocheted ended up being a misshapen, lumpen pot holder for hobbits; I was over twenty before I could braid hair (and I&#x27;m not talking about french braids, either!) , received an \\&quot;F\\&quot; in sewing for crafting an amoeba-like stuffed animal, and when the make your-own jewelry phase hit, I was left holding a tin of beads and a blank expression. Crafty, I am not. This wave iron looked like PhD-level DIY hair. Sadly, I was right. First of all, I felt really weird wearing one black glove (The heatproof glove comes with the unit and is used to protect the hand wrapping when it comes into contact with the barrel). 80&#x27;s flashback, anyone? Ok, so as I, the gloved one, attempted my first \\&quot;wrap\\&quot; according to package directions with a mid-heat setting, I was flummoxed. I finally managed one wave set and, voila! I looked like a seventies burnout with some lightly crimped hair. I decided to turn up the heat to full, what I usually do with my curling iron, and watched the video to see how it was done. I perfected my technique over the next five or six attempts, but my hair was not long enough at mid-shoulder to ever fully execute the figure eight pattern. The model in the video had hair down to her mid-torso. Plus, the iron got hot, and started pulling of hanks of my hair when it reached the base of the barrels. After that, this little experiment ended. To summarize, this unit is for those with VERY long straight hair and exceptional spatial and hand-eye-coordination to execute the wrap and avoid the base which yanks hair. I&#x27;ve managed to navigate a curling iron, but this unit was WAY beyond my skill set. The glove, however, is fabulous. Made out of some space-agey material, it protected my hand from the smoking hot barrels and actually looked pretty cool. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it for my panini press!d the base which yanks hair.

    <li> I used this item 2 times after that I plug it in and it dosent heat up anymore im so disappointed.  The 2 times came out really good and now its not working....:-(</li>
    <li> Yup, I have very long hair (a bit past mid-back) and I can see how this thing would be practically impossible to use on hair any shorter than a good few inches past your shoulders. That said, if you have long hair, GET THIS! Wrapping your hair around the barrels in a figure 8 creates beautiful natural-looking waves -- not at all like the too-perfectly-proportioned ones a waving iron creates. It also does a rad job of creating volume, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m right-handed, but found I have to hold the iron in my right hand and use my left hand -- with the provided heat glove -- to wrap the hair. My hair is pretty thick, so I crank this thing up to &amp;#34;30&amp;#34; and only have to hold each section on it (about 1&amp;#34;-1 1/2&amp;#34; sections) for about 10-15 seconds for it to set. I do prep my hair with Sebastian Whipped Cream, and sometimes I&#x27;ll also use a bit of Ouidad Heat and Humidity Gel when it&#x27;s damp, and then blow dry it first. My hair is naturally fairly wavy, but this tool really enhances and perfects it!</li>
    <li> I read reviews saying that people with shorter hair had issues. Since mine was below my shoulders and layered I figured I would have not problem. This really is a tool for longer hair. It&#x27;s difficult to use with even below shoulder length hair, especially layered and I could not achieve a wavy look with this curling iron. I ordered a single barrel wave iron and will try that instead. Going to see if I can return this item to the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone with long hair (longer than below shoulder) I can see this iron working great.</li>
    <li> My daughter was \\&quot;sold\\&quot; by the advertising for this product and was very excited to try it out.  She has a lot of hair and it&#x27;s fairly long.  It did not curl like in the pictures. She also tried it on a friend who has thinner, shorter hair. It didn&#x27;t work on her either.  We are returning it.</li>
    <li> I have really long full hair ...I&#x27;m talking down to my crack long... Once I read its for long hair I was sold ... I think it&#x27;s best for shoulder to blades length ... It wasn&#x27;t hot enough to work on my hair ... The figure 8 way takes a few to get used to... My waves were more like a calm stream,. Didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> These types of styling products are really catching on. They seem to be replacing the old curling irons with the flap that holds down your hair. With this wand, you get a little black glove and you wrap your hair like a figure eight around the wand. The reason for the glove is that the wand gets very, very hot, thus, it curls your hair very well quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wand with the double prong, is better for long hair and it can make it look wonderful with bouncy light curls that last. People with shorter hair will have a hard time wrapping their hair, but you can also use one prong for shorter hair but you have a harder time wrestling it around the prongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use this type of product, make sure you also have some hair protector on-hand or over time it can burn your hair. A protector will often add shine and protect your hair from the high heat. The high heat is what makes it so effective and fast to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the bouncy curl look and have longer hair, this is a dream product. For shorter hair, using one side of the wand would work but other products may work a lot better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best curler ever I love it. My hair looks super natural when I use it and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I feel like this wand doesn&#x27;t curl the hair as nice as a regular curling iron. Makes curls tighter as well</li>
    <li> I get so May complements on my hair when I use this. It gets very hot and easy to burn yourself. I had 2 friends that bought one because they loved my hair so much!</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;waves\\&quot; don&#x27;t actually look like waves. They look like you tried to curl your hair but messed up. Also you need really long hair for the \\&quot;waves\\&quot; to even look like waves. Was definitely not worth it, I used it once and disliked the end results so much, that I never used it again.</li>
    <li> Got it quickly and worked wonderfully...gives me the curls I was looking for! They wavy just like I want and it heats up fast, curls last!</li>
    <li> I would return this if I could.  A waste of money.  It is very difficult to use and when I finally got the hang of it, it didn&#x27;t produce the curls as advertised.  I barely got any curl at all.</li>
    <li> stupid way to try and curl your hair. I tried it once and for one it took forever and second it looked like I let a 2 year old curl my hair. would never recommend  this to anyone</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get used to, I have really long hair and thought this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem since reading other reviews before purchasing. I followed directions and the outcome didn&#x27;t really give me the look I was trying to achieve. It does take a little practice, but with my long hair, even when wrapping it around both barrells altogether didn&#x27;t give me the loose curls that I wanted. I had to do it the other way where I was wrapping it in and out of both barrels which gave me a tighter more Shirley Temple type of curls. I gave it 3 stars because I just thought even with my ong hair it would be easier to use.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, a few inches past my shoulders. I thought it&#x27;d be long enough for this. Ummm, nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, but not long enough for an easy figure eight configuration. The glove is necessary, but big and goofy. (Yeah, you&#x27;ll feel like an MJ reincarnation. Where are the sequins?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a lot of work for results that could be accomplished easier. For example, if I want beachy waves for the next day, I wash my hair the night before, blow it dry just to get the water out, and knot it in a very loose, low bun with a covered elastic. I make a loop out of my hair and let that dangle, then knot the covered elastic over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wake up, get some coffee, pull out  the elastic and voila! beachy, unfinished waves. No effort, and the effect is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is very, very, VERY long, this is probably a great device. I&#x27;m just to the age where I&#x27;ve got too much to do, and if it isn&#x27;t easy and quick, chances are I&#x27;m going to pass on it.</li>
    <li> This styling tool works amazingly well. It heats up quickly, creates awesome waves that last, and is easy to use once you get the hang of it. The glove isn&#x27;t the most comfortable but not so much so that I&#x27;d consider it a problem. I have fairly thick, long hair and it usually takes about 45-60 minutes to curl or straighten it but this allows me to style my hair in about 20 minutes if I use large enough sections. I was excited to try this product and it ended up exceeding my expectations!</li>
    <li> It does wave your hair and it does look nice but it is a hassle to use. You have the wind your hair back and forth between the two rods using gloves so not to burn yourself. The gloves then limit mobility of your hand. The process is also very time comsuming. If you have plenty of time to get ready, it might work but before school or work, it is not practical.</li>
    <li> this thing ( yes i will say thing ) is horrible !! i bought 2 times one is for me one is for my friend and you know what happened both of them after 2 times using BROKEN.. there is no heat anymore ?? whats going on i just plug in , i start to do my hair after 10 min.  no heat !! and never come back.. DO NOT BUY  !!!</li>
    <li> Little awkward to use and quit don&#x27;t get as hot as my hair needs. It&#x27;s thick and coarse and down to my waist.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair styler for my niece as a gift, per her request ... I still don&#x27;t have her feedback on whether is meeting her expectation so I am withholding the &amp;#34;5th star&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item online after unsuccessfully searching for it in local stores.  Time was running out and I found it on Amazon (at a good price).  The seller came through and delivered the item on time and it arrived in good condition (met my expectations :) ).</li>
    <li> I needed something for a wave like this one makes and it is wonderful. Easy to use and you get great results</li>
    <li> Creates the right beach wave im aiming for. Doesnt make my hair to puffy. Comes with gloves for hand protection. I love!</li>
    <li> I really like it. I don&#x27;t always have the patience or the time to use it, but the effect on the hair is just as promissed.</li>
    <li> LOVED it while it worked, but now it lights up like it is working, but never warms up.&lt;br /&gt;What a RIP!</li>
    <li> This hair styler works wonders on my hair. The curls stay in all day even with humidity! Easy to use and once you get the hang of it you don&#x27;t even need the glove. Product was brand new and serves its purpose greatly!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product--if only I had someone to do my hair for me I would love it! I can see how it would make those mermaid curls.  As stated it leaves the hair smooth and shiny, and heats quickly.  My problem is that I cant make a full curl without the clamp.  I know a clamp leaves a line which is why I wanted to try this product.  What I ended up with was a curl in the middle and a flat end which didnt work.  I had no luck with doing it behind my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are hairdressing savvy and coordinated this would probably be a great tool. I have to go to the back of the class and go back to my old fashioned clamp style curler!</li>
    <li> A little hard to use at first but I&#x27;m slowly getting the hang of it. It creates an interesting beachy wave that I love!</li>
    <li> Wonderful&lt;br /&gt;But he did not expect it to be 120v&lt;br /&gt;Because all new devices 220v</li>
    <li> Way, way, way nicer then anticipated.  My daughter has really thick hair and most hair styler products to do work on her hair, this one does and in an amazing way.  It gets really hot, I&#x27;d recommend the glove other reviewers have recommended, definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this styler, but it exceeded my expectations.  It does a great job of curling mid-length to longer hair and doesn&#x27;t take any longer than to flat iron your hair.  it is pretty easy to use as well and the curl stays in all day.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s easy to use :)</li>
    <li> I love this waver. However, I have to wait until my hair is longer, in other words; it is better on long hair. I just can tell. The waves comes out perfect, just that my last haircut was chopped by a bad hairstylist and is stoo choppy right now. The only cons I give to this waver is that the switch is poor made and turns of easily when you are using it since is right at the handle where you grab it to wave., but I like the results on my hair so much that I found a way to make it work.</li>
    <li> Since I shave my head, I can&#x27;t exactly use this product and give it a proper review, but I -have- used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair a couple of times since getting it, and it&#x27;s worked pretty well! As others have mentioned, the Wrap to Waves Styler works best on longer hair, and when used, it gives the hair a bit of definition. There was a noticeable difference in my daughter&#x27;s hair when we used this on it compared to a regular curler. The lightweight design is a plus too. There are 13 heat settings (Low to 30), and the higher you go, the tighter the hair will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the current price, you could do a lot worse.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Came quickly and exactly like it stated it would come. Great quality product for sure!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. Lots of time to do my hair though so not sure if I would highly reccomend</li>
    <li> If you are looking for that natural wavy look, this is the tool for you. I absolutely love it. The protective wear it comes with is basically a cheap winter glove. I would recommend buying a nicer one at target or ulta. Overall though, great product!</li>
