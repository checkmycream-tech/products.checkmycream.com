    <li> My foot fungal problem goes back decades - had used the prescription drug years ago but severe adverse reactions to it forced me to stop even though it appeared to be starting to work. In some level of desperation, started this product some 3 months ago and my extraordinarily ugly nails are now nearly all cleared up and new strong nail growth suggests the battle has been won. I can finally cut toenails without pain and might even have relatively &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; feet soon. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I did notice some help with the yellowness, but overall, not as I had hoped. It is easy to use and does not smell.</li>
    <li> This product is no gud, was xpecting to see difference in my nails in four to six months, wherein product promise three months it never happened. Really bad buy.</li>
    <li> It has definitely improved the appearance of my nail. The nail is a nice normal color. It is still thick, but I&#x27;m hoping that in time it will grow out normally---there&#x27;s signs that this is happening. It is pretty easy to use. I just put it on in the evening and let it soak in while I&#x27;m watching TV. Sometimes I even buff the surface of the nail so the treatment can soak in more quickly.</li>
    <li> It is the only product that I have ever, ever used that kills toe fungus within a few weeks, I am on my third tube just to be sure it does not come back.  It keeps my nails looking normal.</li>
    <li> Contracted ugly toenail fungus 2 yrs ago. Dermatologist gave me Rx but did not take after I read the side effects of the&lt;br /&gt;Rx. Some of the anti fungal otc products only treat atheletes feet states not effective on fingernails or toenails. I saw that&lt;br /&gt;Kerasal was available from Amazon, ordered, when arrived I started nail treatment. I noticed a big improvement to my&lt;br /&gt;ugly, yellowish, thick toenail until I stumbled over my two big feet with my flip flops and the nail bent backwards and&lt;br /&gt;became detached so I had to stop Kerasal Nail Treatment. For the short time I did use the product it does work. Have&lt;br /&gt;to be patient as can be a long process in treating.  Hopefully I can wear open toed shoes in public again. I hope&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never a victim of toenail fungus again.</li>
    <li> The absolutely best OTC to use. Fast results and honest statements of what to expect re time necessary for final eradication of fungus.</li>
    <li> This worked for my husband!</li>
    <li> Using this twice daily seems to be keeping the toenail fungus from returning.</li>
    <li> This product is fast acting and results can be seen as soon as 72 hours. I am glad Amazon sales it because it is hard to find over the counter.</li>
    <li> Used this treatment for the full 3 months. After about one week, the stuff appears to be working and nails starting turning white but after full use of the treatment, the nails turned back to the ugly brown in a few weeks. Would suggest finding a clinic that has laser treatments for this problem.</li>
    <li> Looked better but did not cure.</li>
    <li> cleared up my nails fast and was easy to use</li>
    <li> Deceptive advertising. Three month supply is for UP to THREE toenails. Most humans have ten toes.</li>
    <li> It really did clear up my nails but it doesn&#x27;t cure.... Again doesn&#x27;t cure and made with UREA.... YUCK.... But my nails never looked better. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except for that!!!</li>
    <li> Best anit-fungal OTC on the market.  But you must be patient.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and after all this time, there is no difference in my toenails.  I thought it would make a difference, but it didn&#x27;t at all.  I&#x27;ll just have to wait for my toenails to grow out to get rid of the fungal color.</li>
    <li> After many years of fungas on nails, I am beginning to see definite improvement.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.</li>
    <li> I was part of the 23% who did not see improvement after 2 weeks.  However, this product does work.  You just have to be patient and persistent.  I had a fungal infection along the side of my big toe, from the base to the top.  That made it impossible to get under the nail to administer treatment, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  This stuff stopped the fungus from spreading, and all I had to do was wait until my nail grew out.  I bought 2 of these tubes in January.  The first tube lasted until November.  It is now December and my nail is nearly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 warnings I can offer.  First, if you spend a day or two hiking or camping in a wet environment, you could undo weeks or months of progress in that one day.  This product seems to work the best by keeping your feet dry and cutting your nail short, but not too short so that you can&#x27;t get under it.  Second, if you apply this product liberally enough that it gets onto the skin around your nail, it will dry the skin out and cause it to peel a bit.  This was insignificant to me though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of potions and lotions to get rid of my nail fungus.  I had yellowing nails and they were growing uneven, etc.  I couldn&#x27;t wear flip flops.  Within a few weeks, my nails were starting to clear and even grow more even.  You have no idea how great it is to find something that works!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a problem with fungus nails for about 8 years.  Finally it spread to a 5th nail this year...not good.  I started treatment with this and everything was fine and looking pretty good for the first 2 weeks. The nail looked clearer and was thinning out.  Though, after the 2nd week I noticed the skin around my infected nails becoming red, swollen, and very dry/flaky.&lt;br /&gt;I had to discontinue use because of the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work (thinning nail and color improvement)&lt;br /&gt;Easy application&lt;br /&gt;No smell&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be harsh (if sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was more for people who have a lot of nails effected by fungus</li>
    <li> It is easily used on your toenails, dries quickly and can be used daily. The only flaw is the aforementioned lack of curative power. Your fungus will keep you company to the grave! The fact that it can be a quiet and discreet companion is your solace if treated with Kerasal is a great comfort. Comfort yourself with it.</li>
    <li> Having tried quite a few of the non-prescription, over-the-counter, remedies (Nonyx Gel, Tineacide Cream, Peda Brush on Fungal Nail Renew, etc.) for fungal nails - especially toenails, I have so far found this European product, Kerasal, to clearly be the most effective one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like it says on the packaging, you really do start to see some notable improvement in about two weeks time and things just keep getting better from that point on. I am still on my first tube (3-month supply) of Kerasal and I do expect to be applying this preparation for 6 months or so before the final verdict is in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the other remedies mentioned above, Kerasal is also more convenient and easier to use since only a single daily application - at night before going to bed - is needed. The other products usually require two daily applications. Furthermore, Kerasal comes in a tube with a handy dandy applicator tip at its end which makes adequately coating your nail(s) with the liquid preparation a very simple task indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To achieve greater success during the fungal nail treatment process it is a good idea to buy one or two steel pedicure/manicure tools made by Body Toolz (such as the Curette Double Angle Nail Cleaner - see my review) that are specifically designed to help in clearing/cleaning out the softened nail debris (keratin) that accumulates behind the nail. This will help future applications of Kerasal or any other medicine to be more effective in achieving the ultimate outcome of once again having fungus-free happy feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extremely thick fungal nails a more radical approach can be effective.
