<li> A little expensive, but love it nonetheless 😀</li>
<li> If you are looking for the same scent from the late 80&#x27;s, early 90&#x27;s, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
<li> I was very sad as this was at least the second of my favorite fragrances</li>
<li> and she doesn&#x27;t like any other.</li>

    <li> This has been discontinued in the stores. It is a great fragrance that is not too sweet. I don&#x27;t know what I will do when I can&#x27;t get it anymore. I have worn it for years. Men (even in N.Y.) have stopped me on the street and asked what I was wearing so that they could buy it for their wives/girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery. Came almost 2 weeks ahead of time. The scent changed from before, it doesn&#x27;t have as strong of an impact as it used it. But the scent is pretty much the same with just a lighter impact then before. But I knew what I was getting into when I searched for this perfume.  So for speedy service and the product satisfaction,  I&#x27;m giving 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My wife said it is great and just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I have searched for this perfume everywhere!!! It&#x27;s my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume and she doesn&#x27;t like any other. Thank you for having this available!! I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
    <li> Shame they stopped making this!</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised and arrived in time.very happy.</li>
    <li> An old favorite fragrance of mine. Can&#x27;t buy it in stores.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the same scent from the late 80&#x27;s, early 90&#x27;s, this isn&#x27;t it. It isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Magie Noire. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t represent the original.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is still available at Lancome.com!  It is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This reproduction of Magie Noire comes as close to the original by Lancome as one might expect.  Thankfully, I had lots of talc, some lotion, some soap and even a bit of toilette left from my last purchases, when I found out that Lancome had discontinued the fragrance.  I was very sad as this was at least the second of my favorite fragrances (Fendi for her)to be discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second purchase of the toilette pump spray and will purchase more as long as they continue making this copy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tbe best for me. I have been wearing for 25 years or more. So thankful now for on line shopping.</li>
    <li> Love this. A little expensive, but love it nonetheless 😀</li>
    <li> Definitely not the scent I remember from my youth.</li>
