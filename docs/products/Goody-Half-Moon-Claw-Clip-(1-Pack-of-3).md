### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best hair clip ever in my opinion.</li>
      <li>best clips I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Functionally, these clips work great!  </li>
      <li>These however are just perfect!</li>
      <li>Perfect and great price!</li>
      <li>The colors are excellent for dyed hair.</li>
      <li>But its a great product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They work great.  </li>
      <li>I also wish they came in better colors &amp; were a bit more curved in the moon shape!!!</li>
      <li>These clips are good for both types of styles.</li>
      <li>But its a good clip</li>
      <li>Good price, cannot find this style locally, thanks Amazon!!!!!  </li>
      <li>However they are not the most attractive clips on the market which is the reason for four stars.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more of these!</li>
      <li>love these they are great for me as I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Still my favorite kind.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite clips.</li>
      <li>I love these clips.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love the colors though.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite clips.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found them on line.  </li>
      <li>I wish there were more colors.</li>
      <li>It is just simply the best.</li>
      <li>And I love them</li>
      <li>The best clip out there holds tight but nice curved style does not dig into scalp.</li>
      <li>....Breaks easily</li>
      <li>They always feel cheap to me.</li>
      <li>I also used them for cheap drawstrings I have bought without a clip.</li>
      <li>I wish they were lots bigger &amp; held more hair!!</li>
      <li>Beautiful, but 8 cms long &amp; kind of soft grip.</li>
      <li>They have made hairpieces much lighter &amp; more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Not too big, probably best for pulling back some of your hair, not all.</li>
      <li>These are great for shoulder length, thin and fine hair.</li>
      <li>wish I could find more like these in different colors.  </li>
      <li>They are okay for my daughter but not big enough for me - even though I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>, so if you have shorter hair (mine is all the way down my back) and thinner hair, it would be great.  </li>
      <li>can believe how difficult it is to find good clips strong clips</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair.</li>
      <li>These clips do a fairly decent job of holding my hair up while I work.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness it comes in a 3 pack, but I wish they were a little sturdier and more durable plastic.</li>
      <li>For a few years now I&#x27;ve been wearing one in particular (the darkest color one because it matches my hair better) almost exclusively, and it still holds my hair tightly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is not too long and not very thick but these clips hold it comfortably and reliably.</li>
      <li>I have used them for years and then couldn&#x27;t find them in a store near me anymore.  </li>
      <li>Definitely not big enough to secure my  long hair.  </li>
      <li>too large, want the original that they are not making any more :(</li>
      <li>Goog for long &amp; straight hair</li>
      <li>These are not quite as large, heavy &amp; uncomfortable as the large clips in  many hairpieces &amp; I don&#x27;t think they stick out as much.</li>
      <li>I have had the hardest time finding clips that hold my hair tight enough and these are the only ones I have been able to find that don&#x27;t fall loose while I&#x27;m working.</li>

<li> The same clip that I bought a few years ago are a big stronger and heavier plastic than this new variety.</li>
<li> Hold my long medium hair in place even when I am running long distance</li>
<li> The teeth are close enough together that the hair is held well, unlike other clips I&#x27;ve tried that slip.</li>
<li> It does not hold my hair enough, keeps bringing my hair down.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The hairstyles I use these clips for are (1) wearing as a bun, (2) my hair down, but held in the back.</li>
<li> This clip may be for those with average or thinner hair.  </li>
<li> My hair is average thickness, medium-long, and wavy.</li>
<li> I think they would be a bit on the small side if you have very thick or long hair.</li>
<li> Too small.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure it would work for thick hair.</li>
<li> hard to find this size in the stores anymore</li>
<li> I wear them at least 3 times a week all day.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve owned this set of clip for at least 7 years and none of them have broken.</li>
<li> I have thin hair, so they work for me.</li>
<li> The color has started to fade where they grip my hair, but the marble-like pattern makes the fading difficult to detect unless they are closely inspected.</li>
<li> Very thin.</li>
<li> I have medium to thick hair and these will not hold :(</li>

    <li> These are my favorite clips. The same clip that I bought a few years ago are a big stronger and heavier plastic than this new variety. Still my favorite kind.</li>
    <li> These hold my hair in place when ever smaller claws and clips don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Perfect and great price!</li>
    <li> Functionally, these clips work great!  However they are not the most attractive clips on the market which is the reason for four stars.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, but 8 cms long &amp; kind of soft grip. The colors are excellent for dyed hair. Goog for long &amp; straight hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ordering more of these! My hair is not too long and not very thick but these clips hold it comfortably and reliably. They never slide out and they are curved just enough.  I wish there were more colors.</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these to switch the clips out in clip-in hairpieces. These are not quite as large, heavy &amp; uncomfortable as the large clips in  many hairpieces &amp; I don&#x27;t think they stick out as much. They have made hairpieces much lighter &amp; more comfortable. I also used them for cheap drawstrings I have bought without a clip. These work very well. Thank God I had these around when a clip from a more expensive piece broke when I put it on before I headed out the door.</li>
    <li> These are great for shoulder length, thin and fine hair. I have had the hardest time finding clips that hold my hair tight enough and these are the only ones I have been able to find that don&#x27;t fall loose while I&#x27;m working.</li>
    <li> the clips were smaller than the picture.</li>
    <li> There was no information listing the size of these in the posting.  They are medium sized.  Definitely not big enough to secure my  long hair.  Love the colors though.</li>
    <li> I am so picky when it comes to clips. They always feel cheap to me. These however are just perfect! Hold my long medium hair in place even when I am running long distance</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair. These clips do a fairly decent job of holding my hair up while I work. However, they are rather flimsy and every once in a while they snap and break. Thank goodness it comes in a 3 pack, but I wish they were a little sturdier and more durable plastic.</li>
    <li> It does not hold my hair enough, keeps bringing my hair down.  I will buy a bigger clip next time.</li>
    <li> too large, want the original that they are not making any more :(</li>
    <li> Not too big, probably best for pulling back some of your hair, not all.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair clip ever in my opinion. It grabs all my hair and does not need to be readjusted throughout the day. The teeth don&#x27;t poke my head. It is just simply the best.</li>

    <li> best clips I have ever used. wish I could find more like these in different colors.  can believe how difficult it is to find good clips strong clips</li>
    <li> Very thin. I have medium to thick hair and these will not hold :(</li>
    <li> Others clips slide.  This one does not.  I love it.  This clip may be for those with average or thinner hair.  I&#x27;m not sure it would work for thick hair. After searching, I could only find these at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Flimsy....Breaks easily</li>
    <li> hard to find this size in the stores anymore ~ about 2&amp;1/2 to 3 inches&lt;br /&gt;They work great.  And I love them</li>
    <li> Good price, cannot find this style locally, thanks Amazon!!!!!  The best clip out there holds tight but nice curved style does not dig into scalp.</li>
    <li> love these they are great for me as I have fine hair</li>
    <li> They are smaller then I need!! I wish they were lots bigger &amp; held more hair!! I also wish they came in better colors &amp; were a bit more curved in the moon shape!!!</li>
    <li> I love these clips.  I have used them for years and then couldn&#x27;t find them in a store near me anymore.  I am so glad I found them on line.  I hope Goody never stops making them.</li>
    <li> Too small.  They are okay for my daughter but not big enough for me - even though I have fine hair.</li>
    <li> than I would like.  But its a good clip, so if you have shorter hair (mine is all the way down my back) and thinner hair, it would be great.  I can&#x27;t wear the bigger ones of this style, they&#x27;re too big.  I guess I&#x27;m somewhere between a child&#x27;s head and an adults.  But its a great product.</li>
    <li> I like these because they do not dig into your skull. That said, they are pretty small. I have thin hair, so they work for me. I think they would be a bit on the small side if you have very thick or long hair.</li>
