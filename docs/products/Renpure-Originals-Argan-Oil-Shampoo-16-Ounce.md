      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>I had very fine hair</li>
      <li>The smell, which reminds me of baby powder, is very light and tends to get masked by the smell of whatever styling products I&#x27;m using at the time.  </li>
      <li>and I am amazed at the huge difference in my hair!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-I am noticing a lot more hair breakage.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo is very mild which allows for everyday wash. I have used this for a few months now and do not use any other shampoo. After trying many shampoos out there, I find this one to be the best for me and will keep using it in the future. I do recommend this to anyone who wants great, mild shampoo that not only washes, but nurtures hair. Thank you very much, Renpure, for the wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, I love the smell, and my hair AND scalp are healthier!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, makes my hair feel soft and seems to help keep the frizz down on humid days.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at Rite Aide because it was a buy one get one free deal, I have color treated hair so it tends to be really dry especially on the ends. I love that this has no harsh chemicals in it that further increase the dryness. I used this and was amazed at how wonderfull my hair looked and felt.  When I ran out of it, I used my previous shampoo and immediately could tell the difference In how dry my hair felt. When I went back to Rite Aid the price was back up to 5.99 per bottle, so jumped on Amazon to stock up. This stuff is wonderful, and smells wonderful too. it feels good to be doing something nice for my hair. Give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry, keep in mind it&#x27;s not meant to be super foamy because it doesnt contain the harsh chemicals, but i think it foams much better then expected. Dont forget the conditioner too!</li>
    <li> This product is a disaster. It makes ur hair so dry &amp; fragile that nothing else can fix it.&lt;br /&gt;If u have dry &amp; freezy hair avoid this. Hate it.</li>
    <li> This is an awuful shampoo.  There are excellent brands out there if you want an argan oil shampoo with no sulfates or phosphates, but this is not one of them.  Despite the ingredients, there is something in this shampoo that is REALLY drying.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I am a cancer survivor and after my chemo my hair started growing back in various stages..thicker in some spots ..much more grey than before and curls that would make Shirley Temple envious. On a whim I bought the Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner.  At the risk of sounding boastful my hair has turned beautiful! My curls are the talk if everyone at work..my silver is shiny and bright and the thickness is beautiful. I am so glad I bought the 32 oz. bottles of each. I will never be without!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the product but I feel like the quantity is not exactly as stated. I think I&#x27;m cheated.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo my, husband loves it for his oily hair.  It has no sulfates or other bad ingredients.  Renpure is a great company.  I will use no other shampoo from now on.</li>
    <li> This is hard to lather but smells great and is good for your hair. I prefer the conditioner to shampoo</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other Renpure Organics shampoos/conditioners on my hair, but this one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair that is combination: very dry at ends and oily near roots.  I was worried this would weigh my hair down and make it greasy, but instead my hair is perfect.  Not to mention my boyfriend loves the smell.  I have never had any other shampoo make my hair SO SOFT, and I just bought the conditioner and oil treatment as well to try.  If you want super soft and nurished locks, try this shampoo!</li>
    <li> The Argan Combo was such a disappointment. I did not feel there was any Argon oil or any other healing, properties in this product. I wear my hair short and natural without chemical straighteners and found this product drying and the conditioner did little to help, even leaving it on for an extended time. I purchased it cheap (shampoo and conditioner for under five dollars) but you get what you pay for with this one. Using the shampoo and conditioner left my hair dry and my roots MORE tangled than from using other sulfate brands of shampoo. I expected more from this product claiming to be non-sulfate. Shine was maintained but my hair was dry and I had to spend more time using other conditioners and oils to get my hair back right until I shampooed the Renpure results out after a few days. Oh and the smell, horrible. Others here had mentioned problems with the smell and I found it to be somewhat lingering petroleum-based, sorta plastic artificially sweet perfumy residue smell. Not good. Avoid this product. The Agadir shampoo and conditioner is far better as Argan products go.</li>
    <li> Daughter \\&quot;get this again-feel my hair-someone walked by and said mmm, your hair smells good\\&quot; better than othr renpure shampoo. BB and beyond sells for 6.99</li>
    <li> I have long wavy strawberry-blonde hair which tends to be dry and frizzy. I was looking for a sulfate-free shampoo and found this for about $6 at Target so I took a chance.  I LOVE it.  It&#x27;s very thick so I dilute it about 50/50 with water which makes it easier to distribute (I keep a little plastic cup for this purpose in my shower).  I work it well into my scalp and smooth a little bit down to the ends, then rinse. Then I apply a good amount of some cheap V05 conditioner all down the length of my hair and just a little bit at the scalp. It took about two weeks for my hair to get used to this new shampoo, but now my hair is soft, silky, shiny, manageable and much less frizzy.  I only need to wash it every 3-4 days; maybe my scalp isn&#x27;t overproducing oil anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try the matching conditioner as soon as I run out of my cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> There is something off about this shampoo.  I got it at a local beauty supply store for ridiculously cheap and figured why not, I currently put Moroccan oil in my hair after i wash it why not use argan oil during my shower.    Well first of all it smells odd, not bad, just odd, it doesn&#x27;t have the yummy smell of vanilla or peaches, just odd smell, and the conditioner is water thin, literally squirted all over the wall it was that thin.    My hair i guess feels soft but it also feels dry, dryer than usual.  Probably not worth the money I paid even if i did get it on sale.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stripped, and this has ended my search. The smell is okay, but it&#x27;s something I can deal with. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I suffer from really oily hair. I&#x27;ve tried multiple products from cheap to expensive, wet to dry shampoos and never felt like my hair was ever truly clean. I bought this shampoo (and the conditioner) at the grocery store on a whim, mostly because I liked the way it smelled. Seeing that it was chloride/salt/sulfates/paraben/gluten-free was a plus as I&#x27;ve read multiple articles about chemicals to avoid in your shampoos. After just one use my hair had done a complete 180. It&#x27;s not oily any more, yet it has a healthy shine. The scent is amazing and is something I can smell all day long. I had very fine hair and now it feels like it&#x27;s more full, thicker, and less of an electricity conductor. I would recommend this product to anyone in my situation. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I bought the Renpure Organics shampoo and conditioner about 4 weeks ago as a last ditch effort to keep my fine, brittle hair from breaking and falling out. Aside from having fine/weak hair, I also suffer from Alopecia Areata which is the sudden loss of hair in patches, of which there is no known cure yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt and saw an immediate change in my hair and scalp after the first use. No more dry feeling scalp, hair is very shiney, smooth, stronger, fuller, no heavy or oily residue (important for people with fine hair) and best of all, I am actually starting to feel little stubbles where new hair is growing in over my entire scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. Probably because it&#x27;s organic, so no harsh additives but also because the mix of ingredients chosen, actually produce a positive result.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo! It left my hair feeling soft and smooth. Also its safe for color treated hair and didn&#x27;t strip the color out. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> i started using this shampoo and the accompanying conditioner maybe a year or so ago, and i&#x27;ve really noticed a change in my hair.  i&#x27;ve got thick, curly hair, which would often get tangled during the day and really, using the shampoo and the conditioner daily has made a huge difference.  you know how your hair gets dry and difficult to comb when you have highlights?  not with this shampoo and conditioner.  i originally bought it @ walgreens but found this great deal online on amazon which is much cheaper.  will reorder from here again.</li>
    <li> Leave hair silky smooth and seems to help strengthen.  My husband who could care less of shampoo actually said he likes this which is weird because he never makes comments on shampoo.  Teen Daughter loves it too.  One bottle goes a long way.  Great price as well!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the smell and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates in it (which incidentally is why it doesn&#x27;t lather). But it made my hair feel like it was coated in something waxy. The next day my hair looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in days. I tossed it. $7.00 wasted.</li>
    <li> It smells great, it feels great when massaged into the scalp (better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried). However, without fail, it always leaves my scalp greasy and my hair limp. If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would love it, but unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair so I didn&#x27;t use a lot, but it still made my hair greasy and flakey.</li>
    <li> smell like a delicious......my hair is softly</li>
    <li> Argan Oil Shampoo leaves my hair soft,manageable,and not greasy looking. it has a nice, light scent! Would recommend! Good seller...fast shipping!</li>
    <li> nice smell. and it leaves my hair so soft and shiny. i have curly, frizzy hair, and i live in the humidity of florida. this product seems to work very well at calming and maintaining the frizz. i also like that it is sulfate free.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Shampoo &amp; conditioner left hair, soft &amp; manageable. Why 4 rating - FRAGRANCE - The strong argan smell and then additionally added fragrance - TOO MUCH - Passed both products along after a week. Companies \\&quot;every product should not have fragrance\\&quot; - common sense - fragrances conflict amongst the different products. Now add in sensitivities, its a chemical nightmare.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a family member who has colored treated hair.  She absolutely loves this shampoo, as well as the conditioner!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It makes my hair feel soft, and is not oily like I thought it would be. It has protected my fine hair from more breakage. The smell is brilliant. It lasts a long time, and my hair is so long I can sit on it. It did do something to my color. It kinda made it AWESOME! It didn&#x27;t strip it, it made it a brilliant soft shine color. Everyday feels like the perfect hair day. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Renpure products. Not only are they organic, chemical free, and not tested on animals, but they don&#x27;t contain that dirty S-word in most shampoos (sulfates) and it leaves my hair oh-so-soft. I&#x27;ve also used Renpure&#x27;s Brazillian Keratin shampoo and conditioner, but I prefer the Argan Oil. I have curly hair and can usually get away without washing my hair very often, but this allows me to go longer between washes because my scalp doesn&#x27;t get oily. I think that&#x27;s due to the lack of sulfates which usually dries out your hair and causes your scalp to overproduce oil. Not with this shampoo. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Would NOT recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I leaves the hair feeling lanky and slightly grimy. As if it&#x27;s not been cleaned but actually coated in more oil. On top pf that it cased skin irritation on the scalp - like previous reviews described. I was willing to give it a try but that was a big mistake. Returning it immediately. Do not try it.&lt;br /&gt;I could understand that some shampoos may cause reaction to a sensitive skin and some people might be allergic to something - but this! This leaves your hair dirtier than when you stared. They seriously need to work on the formula!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian, have fairly fine hair but a lot of it (thick pony tail, lots of body), it falls to about 6 inches below my shoulders, and my hair/skin is somewhat oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I love:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or leave it oily at the end of the day the way most moisturizing shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out/leave lots of visible frizz the way volumizing shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks healthier. I&#x27;m getting a lot of compliments and it&#x27;s with a lot less effort.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp isn&#x27;t itchy. Didn&#x27;t realize that was an issue, but the absence is noted.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using fewer products - no longer use conditioner daily on the ends, no smoothing creams needed.&lt;br /&gt;I can use a fairly small amount of it and just comb through with my fingers. One bottle is just lasting and lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t love:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather. I know, it isn&#x27;t supposed to but it doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot; the way I&#x27;m used to in the shower (great when dry). I&#x27;ll live.&lt;br /&gt;I use a clarifying shampoo occasionally. I notice my hair looks flatter after a week or two if I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: the smell is inoffensive. It&#x27;s just...fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, but I bought it for the fragrance- it smells so good!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I picked it up at target along with the matching conditioner. I like that it is &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; for your hair than most other products. For both my hair, and my daughter&#x27;s hair, it lathers up very well. It&#x27;s nice to find a product that I can for me and my daughter&#x27;s hair types without spending a whole lot. I have really thick and long hair that tends to be poofy with a wave, meanwhile, my daughter is biracial with a similar texture to mine, but with more curl. I personal don&#x27;t like using a lot of chemicals in my daughter&#x27;s hair, so I do feel a lot better knowing this is a better option. It runs a similar price range with Herbal Essences and Garnier Fructis. The shampoo itself is wonderful. I love that it&#x27;s thicker than most of the others out on the market. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me. I feel like my hair is soft and clean when using the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought the big size bottles of this on sale at our local store and am so glad I did. I won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those complaining about it leaving your hair a dry tangled mess, I&#x27;ve noticed when switching to more natural products that it takes some time for your hair to get used to not needing all that gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length, color treated, curly hair and after a few uses, I haven&#x27;t needed any additional products, other than some straight Argan oil that I put on when my hair is wet.  I don&#x27;t need gel, or mouse, or curl definers at all which is something I have always needed once my hair gets past a certain length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner doesn&#x27;t have all that other junk in it that the normal conditioners have and that&#x27;s where your missing that easy to brush through feeling.  To remedy that I bought the tangle tease brush, and even after having my hair up in a half bun/pony tail thing over night (which is impossible to brush through when it&#x27;s dry), after using the shampoo, matching conditioner, and that brush, it didn&#x27;t hurt to brush through my hair at all and there was very little hair on the brush when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting that after using this and straight Argan oil on my hair for awhile when I went to use my garnier hair spray for the first time in a few weeks for a little extra hold (I usually love the smell of it), all that I could smell was the alcohol in it.  Now I need to check out renpure&#x27;s other products and see if they have a hairspray because I don&#x27;t want to use anything alcohol based that will dry my hair out all over again.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product in the clearance section of Walgreens. Thought I would try it out because the price was amazing. I tried it out and it did wonders for my hair. A little bit of the shampoo and  conditioner goes a long way and it leaves my hair so soft. I also love how it&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals so it&#x27;s safe for my hair. I haven&#x27;t even able to find it in Walgreens again so I have been ordering online. Deffinitly the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used for the price it&#x27;s sold at.</li>
    <li> It says not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this stuff smells and makes my thin, heat-damaged hair feel, however, I found the same size bottle of shampoo at Fred Meyer for just under $6 (their everyday price). I will say that I&#x27;ve always had issues with dandruff and have noticed no changes with that since using this. Maybe a few more weeks of use will do the trick. Also, even though my hair is thin, I always feel like I have to wash my hair 2-3 times in the shower to really feel like I&#x27;m getting down to the scalp.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m allergic to everything and this shampoo/conditioner have been great. No itching or hair loss. It also lasts forever. I have very curly and tangled, frizzy hair and I only need a little to make it work. Love it</li>
    <li> call me crazy, but my hair is growing back.  i discovered i am allergic to wheat and have been avoiding it in my diet, but this is the first time i&#x27;ve tried a gluten-free shampoo.  Wow, my little hairs are growing back, and not just the ones on my back!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather well/doesn&#x27;t reach the scalp; for some reason, this shampoo gave me a lot of hair fall/loss after showering.</li>
    <li> After reading positive reviews, I wanted to like this product but I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I won&#x27;t be getting this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: This product is really drying to my hair and leaves it in tangles. I have to use a super softening conditioner to try to counteract this. It also has a sickenly sweet smell I&#x27;d equate to old women&#x27;s perfume. I didn&#x27;t expect it to lather and it doesn&#x27;t. Lastly, one day after washing my hair is lying flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: It makes my hair extra shiny and it doesn&#x27;t have as many nasty chemicals as other products.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo on the fly one day at A&amp;P because I wanted to try something new. I have very fine hair and I liked that it didn&#x27;t weigh it down. I actually like the powdery smell it has.. and it leaves my hair with a nice texture. I didnt find it drying and my hair is much more managable and shiney. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that there is more cocoa nut products in the ingrediants than Argan, but it works well all the same. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I switched to coconut-based shampoos a year ago after trying &amp;#34;poo-free&amp;#34; methods (unsuccessfully.)  However, I didn&#x27;t want to return to a shampoo with sodium laureth sulfate once I&#x27;d gotten rid of the coatings on my hair. I haven&#x27;t found many hair products without ingredients that cause allergic reactions in me.  Before I switched to this fabulous shampoo, I used the Renpure Australian Sun &amp; Surf Argan Oil Shampoo but broke out in hives from it.  I loved the shampoo, though, and would recommend that one in a heartbeat.  Renpure makes a good quality product, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live in a cold climate, or you have a cold bathroom like I do, you&#x27;ll notice the coconut-oil products do get thicker and harder to pour out of the bottle in the morning.  This is not a high-lathering shampoo, either and you might use more than regular shampoo.  This one is far more moisturizing than most, and I only use a conditioning treatment &#x27;as needed&#x27; now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily hair but it&#x27;s calmed down by half since I detoxed it from regular shampoos and started using Renpure Originals.  I color my hair, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and make it feel like wet straw in the shower.  If you have really dry hair, you&#x27;ll probably need a bit of conditioner with this--but probably use less than you used to.  I think the shampoo leaves a very mild beeswax scent on your hair while it&#x27;s wet.  You won&#x27;t notice it so much after it&#x27;s dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the other organic shampoos on the market, this product is quite a good bargain.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this at the supermarket in search of a new shampoo without the harsh chemical and irritants that are found in so many products.  I&#x27;ve heard great things about Argan Oil and thought I would give this a shot.  The shampoo has a nice light smell to it and thicker consistency than most brands.  I&#x27;ve found that it cleans my hair really well, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it does with other shampoos.  My hair the next day tends to be pretty greasy.  I also pair this shampoo up with the Argan Oil Conditioner.  My hair feels clean, soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on hair since I started using these products.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product to use at our lake house outside shower. I loved it so much I am using it all the time.  I also use the conditioner.  Even with the chemicals I use in my hair (highlights/perms), this shampoo has kept my hair shiny and healthy.  I just loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The pricing at Amazon was much better than the store.</li>
    <li> I am searching for a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner that are a little better for me and for the earth than typical drugstore products. After reading reviews, I thought I&#x27;d chance this one and give it a try. Womp womp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -it smells good!&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s in fact so drying that my hair STILL doesn&#x27;t have much oiliness on Day 2 after washing and feels relatively clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: -it doesn&#x27;t even pretend to lather. I have thick hair and have to use a lot of this product to even try to clean my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s drying. HOW?! Argan Oil is in its name! I can tell in the shower that it&#x27;s drying, and out of the shower, it&#x27;s tangled and feels like straw.&lt;br /&gt;-I am noticing a lot more hair breakage. Is it making my hair fall out?&lt;br /&gt;-I picked this up at a Rite-Aid, and it allegedly was attached to an online rebate. Um. No sign of rebate on the product&#x27;s website. Too bad. I wonder if I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> i want to be fair with this review. i love the renpure company and only use their hair care. I tried this argan oil&lt;br /&gt;instead of the kind i usually get for volume and it was good but not as good as the one in the red bottle(the&lt;br /&gt;best) again, this is a great company and doesn&#x27;t test on animals (so important) so i will always buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;received on time and in good pkg.  from the Flowergirl</li>
    <li> Something in this shampoo really dried out my hair.  Even with the use of the conditioner my hair was abnormally dry.  I thought it might be a fluke so I  used the shampoo and conditioner again with the same results.  My hair felt damaged both times and was very difficult to brush out afterwards.  I have never had an issue with other Renpure products, but I will never be using this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I have tried soooooo many shampoos/conditioners to make my long, coarse, thick, wavy, frizzy, dry hair behave.  I&#x27;ve even used the Renpure straight shampoo, which I liked the best...until I tried their Argan shampoo.  The Argan is my shampoo soul mate.  : )  My hair is so incredibly soft, which I NEVER thought it would ever be.  It&#x27;s super shiny and my waves and curls are actually smooth and defined instead of being one giant puff. I&#x27;ve found other natural shampoos don&#x27;t lather but this one creates a wonderful rich lather.  The conditioner is really thick and leaves my hair silky and the tangles just fall out.  It smells awesome...powdery and fresh.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this stuff because of the scent.  Reminds me of a perfume my grandma would wear.  Very strong and not an \\&quot;organic or natural\\&quot; scent...more synthetic smelling (to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it made my hair very soft and not frizzy once blow-dried.  If you can stand the scent, its a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> it is a good product, make&#x27;s my hair feel soft and clean,i would tell my friend and family to try it</li>
    <li> As someone with, as I call it, Albert Einstein hair that&#x27;s more oily and fine, all I can say is: wow! This shampoo makes my hair feel lighter than anything I&#x27;ve tried while having longer hair (granted, I don&#x27;t spend too much money on shampoo, so I can&#x27;t testify to Wen or something that absurdly expensive), and it&#x27;s nice knowing that I&#x27;m using something healthy on my hair and, really, better for the local sewage system. After a couple weeks, my hair feels thicker, and it seems that breakage is reduced when I use this shampoo vs. the Pantene I scored for a great price on Amazon last month (which, itself, was an upgrade from the shampoos I&#x27;d used for the previous few years). My hair feels softer, whether or not I condition, compared to other shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the last few years. My hair definitely feels less gunky the next day (or the day after if I skip a day of shampooing) than it has with any other shampoo I can recall. Since I don&#x27;t treat or straighten my hair, and try my hardest not to even brush or comb it, I can&#x27;t judge it in that capacity, but I can also comment that my hair&#x27;s frizziness has decreased while using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered Renpure products because of a buy one, get one free deal from a major retail/pharmacy chain&#x27;s online store, making this product $6 for two bottles, and I&#x27;ve stocked up! This stuff has been so nice that I&#x27;ve bought the argan oil conditioner, keratin shampoo, and their Wen-competitor named Ren, and I&#x27;ll eventually leave reviews for those (so far, so good, for both the argan oil conditioner and keratin shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, if you have the money or can get this for a good price, go for it! I&#x27;m thrilled to have discovered this shampoo, especially considering I&#x27;m paying half price compared to Amazon or anywhere else. At $6 a bottle, it&#x27;d still be worth buying if I had the money, and I&#x27;ll keep an eye out for online prices in the future, just in case Amazon has it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I gave a sample of this shampoo to someone in my family with similar hair, and it received similar rave reviews.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this shampoo. It left my hair very tangled. Even after using large amounts of the matching conditioner, my hair was still more tangled than had I used Pantene or Loreal. After my hair was dry it was not any shinier, softer, or stronger feeling than when I use other shampoos. My hair was somewhat dry and roughed up. I did use it for several weeks.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best shampoo and conditioner (the Renpure Argan Oil blue bottle stuff) there ever was. I am a college student, under 30, and I have thick and long Persian hair that has always been trouble. It&#x27;s greasy at the roots, and dry at the bottoms. I have been suffering from split ends since high school (over 10 years ago). I stopped blow drying my hair and using any heat products. It didn&#x27;t work. I combined that with chopping all of my hair off and starting over, to get trips every 3 months. It didn&#x27;t work. I tried coconut oil hair masks twice a week, worked to make my hair healthier but the split ends kept coming. I have been using this shampoo for over 3 months now and I don&#x27;t have to go get my hair trimmed this time around (which means it can grow longer which I am trying to do!!). My split ends are so few in number, and my hair SHINES! It shines, people! The oil in my hair is evenly distributed. I still do the coconut but 1 time every 1-2 weeks. I get so many compliments on my hair shining and it&#x27;s color. I can&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;m seriously not one of those people who is stuck to a certain brand or product, but I am to this one. I have been searching for a great shampoo for a long time. Like I said, I&#x27;m in college so I&#x27;m not looking to spend $20 on a bottle of shampoo. The regular garner fructis and Loreal and Tresemme and Herbal Essences really dried out my hair. For years. I began searching for cruelty-free products so I tried Avalon, Jason&#x27;s, and some other ones I can&#x27;t remember the name. This is by far the best product there is. It&#x27;s cruelty free and more natural. And to whoever says it doesn&#x27;t lather, it SO lathers. I don&#x27;t know were they putting their index finger on their head and mashing it, expecting a bubble bath? This is great, you&#x27;re hair will be thankful for it, and you won&#x27;t go wrong. They sell it at Kroger for $5.99 for 16 oz so if you find it cheaper than that it is a deal! Hope you enjoy it!</li>
    <li> This is nice shampoo and especially for the price!  I have fine hair though and it seems to be a little bit heavy for my hair.  I just don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> Recently I had been hearing about the benefits of Argan oil for hair and skin, so I went looking for products on Amazon.  Renpure products did not come up in my original Amazon search, so I found myself browsing RiteAid.  Most of the Argan oil products I saw at the drugstore had other oils as their main ingredient, with Argan pretty far down the list -- and were still fairly pricey.  I originally picked up the Renpure oil treatment because according to the label it had the highest proportion of Argan oil of anything on the shelf, so I decided to get it.  Then I looked at the shampoo and conditioner.  Like another reviewer said, I was skeptical they could be any good for the relatively low price, but I figured \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot; and gave it a try.  The combination of the three products -- shampoo, conditioner, and oil (before blow-drying, but also occasionally on already-dried hair) has been AMAZING!  I have very thick, very coarse, frizzy, unruly hair that often gets dried out. I&#x27;ve been a client of top stylists in many major cities over the years, have never scrimped on good quality products, and I&#x27;ve tried going both curly and straight -- but my hair has always been a major frustration and hassle. For the past few years, I had been doing thermal reconditioning with great success, but I have been worried about the toxic chemicals.  Now, using this combination of products, for the first time ever in my 47 years, my hair looks and feels fantastic with no real maintenance other than a quick blow dry and putting it up in a pony-tail bun for few hours afterward. It&#x27;s silky and smooth without using a flatiron -- but still bouncy and wavy and lush in a shampoo-commercial kind of way. I have gotten tons of compliments from people. I also really, really like the smell of the products, which is botanical in a real -- not fake -- way, and does not set off my allergies like so many other haircare products that make me sneeze or itch.  Amazon has better prices than the drugstore on these products, so I will buy here from now on, but in the mean time just wanted to put my two cents in for a line of products I am absolutely loving!</li>
    <li> A few years ago I started trying to cut out beauty products with all the (supposedly) bad sulfates and parabens. Problem is they can be super expensive (I&#x27;m looking at you, Whole Foods) or if they ARE affordable, using them is a nightmare. It feels like you haven&#x27;t even washed your hair, forget trying to brush through it after a shower, and once you do get through it prepare for frizz city. This shampoo takes care of all of that, so I&#x27;m ecstatic I found it. It smells good, doesn&#x27;t wreck my hair, and is shockingly inexpensive. Recommended on all fronts.</li>
    <li> This has a really nice smell, and works great for my daughters hair. leaves hair soft and smooth w/o nasty chemicals. Have used a lot of Renpure products. They offer great quailty products.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo at a grocery store, bundled with the conditioner and the deep conditioning oil for only $11 so I was skeptical with minimal expectations, but now feel like I got a steal! I figured it would be worth a try. I bought some for my friend too. We both love it! I have very fine, dry, wavy hair. She has very thick, coarse, straight hair. The shampoo cleans perfectly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residues and my hair has more volume. My hair is usually soft and shiny but now it is even more so. The scent reminds me of something my grandfather would wear but it is not over powering. The conditioner also doesn&#x27;t feel like it leaves any residues and detangles well. The oil is AMAZING. I usually steer clear of using any types of oils in my hair because my hair is so fine it doesn&#x27;t take much to look greasy. I figured I&#x27;d try it just to see. I used a dime size drop and worked it in from tip to root on my wet hair. My hair dried with no grease or frizz! And my waves were silky shiny smooth! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I was looking for a sulfate-free product.  The smell, which reminds me of baby powder, is very light and tends to get masked by the smell of whatever styling products I&#x27;m using at the time.  Sulfate-free shampoos by nature don&#x27;t later as well as other shampoos, but I found that I only needed about a quarter-size amount to get my hair and scalp clean (I have long, thin, straight hair, and a lot of it).  This shampoo didn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all, but it did make it really soft, really shiny, and a lot less frizzy.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather like other products, meaning it DOES NOT contain foaming agents which are harsh and drying to the scalp. I love it!</li>
    <li> I use all of Renpure&#x27;s products and I honestly love them. My one complaint about this particular product is that the scent is a bit manley it reminds me of men&#x27;s deodorant. But this product is awesome makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I am a caucasian woman with straight normal long hair.  I tried many times to like this, but it is literally like putting elmers glue in your hair and trying to manipulate with your fingers to cleanse.  Once this was in my hair, I could NOT even get to my scalp to cleanse it.  I don&#x27;t understand all the great reviews.  My husband (short hair) said he&#x27;ll use it.</li>
    <li> bought for my daughter in law, and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I like that this shampoo has different oils for your hair and that&#x27;s what makes it a good shampoo. What I don&#x27;t like is that sulfate free shampoos tend to not leave hair as silky, and kind of thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost exclusively for the past year.  It&#x27;s the only thing that seems to control my little flyaways.  I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this shampoo. I have used the Renpure cleansing conditioner and wasnt happy with it at all. So when I tried this argan shampoo and it made my hair so soft, shiny and healthy looking. I did have to use a lot before I saw a lather because I have thick hair, but the product isnt really that expensive so I dont have a problem with that. I only wash my hair 2 times a week and when I used this shampoo I had not washed my hair in 3 days and it got it so clean. I think its worth a try if you are on the fence!</li>
    <li> I have very thin wavy hair that tends to be ok with most shampoos/conditioners, but I wanted to try something good for my hair.  I love this shampoo and conditioner and it has been an awesome change.  After the first use, my hair was so much softer and I got a lot of my curls back, now after a week I don&#x27;t even have to work hard to have beautiful curls.  When I straighten my hair, it&#x27;s so soft and silky.  I also love the scent!</li>
    <li> I have (or had, I should say) really thin hair. It was flat and dry all the time. I tried this shampoo when I found it at Walmart for $5.99 per bottle (shampoo and conditioner). I must say I went from losing about 10 strands of hair in the shower to 3. I do not need to blow-dry my hair either (very energy saving!) since this shampoo helps frizz control and keeps hair straight or with a natural volumous appearance. I recommend this shampoo to anyone with colored, or non-colored thin hair. The conditioner is just as great! The smell is not amazing, but why does that matter if a product works and makes your hair feel and look better.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this is better than the last shampoo and conditioner that I was using. I think the people who complain this is really drying are used to the sulfates in shampoos. I say that because I have used other sulfate free shampoo and they do feel different than shampoos with sulfate. I don&#x27;t think it makes your hair dry, but it does feel funny. This does that less so than other sulfate free shampoos and conditioners. My hair is shiny, clean, and it doesn&#x27;t feel or look dry. I use the renpure argan oil conditioner as well. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but the last brand I bought that was sulfate free smelled like hair dye or perm chemicals, at least this has a less obnoxious smell. For the price, this isn&#x27;t bad. I do prefer Healthy Sexy Hair to this but I don&#x27;t think I prefer it enough to pay the difference.</li>
    <li> This is an average sulfate free shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t have enough Argan Oil to help your hair if it&#x27;s very dry and may not be the best product for naturally curly hair which is almost always dry. I&#x27;ll use what I have but don&#x27;t plan to buy this again as there are much better products out there for my naturally curly, colored, hair in chronic need of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I take it all back. This stuff isn&#x27;t that great. It seemed like it was, at first, but I quickly noticed some issues with it. The shampoo is way too thick; it&#x27;s really hard to work into a lather, and work into your hair and scalp. It takes forever to rinse out. The conditioner is too thin. I had to use WAY too much, 2-3x more than what I would normally use. It made my hair feel nice the first two or three times I used it, since then, my hair has gotten frizzier every time I wash it. I couldn&#x27;t wait to run out so I can try something else. Too pricey and not that great of results. Boo.</li>
    <li> I have typical mixed race hair.  No terribly thick, not terribly fine.  Frizzy and Dry as all heck, yet wavy when tamed.  This is ok.  Not bad, Not great.</li>
    <li> My hair has been fried from imbalanced chemicals in our club pool.  I swim daily and today could no longer take the condition of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;i bought this product from our local grocery store right after leaving the club today.&lt;br /&gt;I came home and rewashed/conditioned my hair with this product and I am amazed at the huge difference in my hair!  It feels soft, could be combed and dried and styled, does not feel greasy...I am so pleased!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing!  It makes my hair super clean and soft without leaving any greasiness, yet keeping it perfectly clean.  I can go three to four days without needing to wash it. I do have to use quite a bit to wash all of my hair (I have super long hair) because it does not suds up like normal shampoos.  I make sure only to wash the top of my hair and scalp, otherwise my ends get to dry.  It&#x27;s great that it comes in a two-pack!  Great value!</li>
    <li> I have finally found a great product for my hair -- At a great price!  I can&#x27;t justify spending tons of money on hair products, and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to.  I didn&#x27;t expect to notice such a difference after just one use.  I have thick, curly hair and with that comes poofiness and frizziness that I can never seem to manage.  I used the shampoo, conditioner, and blow-out creme and my hair is noticeably softer, so much more manageable and lays nicely. I couldn&#x27;t be more excited!  Made without parabens, sulfates, dyes, etc. -- these are great products.  Try it!</li>
    <li> 2 stars since they don&#x27;t test on animals and for the scent (I would use this product FOREVER based on the scent - love it.) However, it was nearly impossible to get a comb through my hair after towel drying. There were literal knots. Had to spritz detangler all over and still ended up ripping out strands of hair with comb. The second day, I tried doubling up on the conditioner, but still knots. The label states that with other shampoos most damage to hair occurs during the lathering process - well maybe this shampoo improves on that process, but completely damaging during the combing out process. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, my hair felt much better after using and love the natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for money, will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Overall I love this stuff. It makes my hair smell clean and it feels lighter and not weighed down. On the down side its hard to lather, especially into longer hair. I have to add water to my hair after I put the shampoo in for it to get thin enough to really lather it in. The conditioner is perfect, not greasy at all. But I find my bangs and hairline still get greasy after a day of not washing it but that could just be my skin oils not necessarily the product. Love that it&#x27;s less harsh and has less chemicals!</li>
    <li> I must say I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I didn&#x27;t know what to think of a relatively cheap drugstore \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and chemical free brand, but I am now a convert. I only rated 4 out of 5 stars because the way my very fine and wavy hair is cut right now, it almost made it to soft to hold the style, and I didn&#x27;t love the smell. However, my hair feels better and has been less frizzy than it has been in years. Also--I have struggled with a dry itchy scalp and dandruff my whole life, and after trying many different \\&quot;anti-dandruff\\&quot; shampoos, I had given up on anything ever working. After one use of this shampoo and conditioner, I have a non-itchy scalp, and no discernible dandruff--That alone makes it pretty amazing, and probably worth 5 stars, but I just found it a bit to heavy for my hair. Anyone else with thicker or courser hair will find it a godsend. I will be trying out RenPure&#x27;s conditiong shampoos, because I think those will be just the ticket for my particular type of hair (a lot of fine, wavy,dry hair prone to breakage and frizz.) Worth it for the difference in my scalp.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!</li>
    <li> I purchase this from the drug store most of the time in the big family size bottles. After trying this product I have been amazed!!! My hair is healthy an thicker than it was before. My hair use to fall out in the shower an break an shed all over the place. Now after using this shampoo it has regrowth in only 2 months. It made my scalp resprout baby hairs that have since grown into longer one&#x27;s. Making my hair full again. I just bought this because it was on sale, boy was I surprised. ☺👍❤💚💜💙</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I have very fine hair and had experienced some hair loss due to stress. I tried various shampoos designed to encourage hair growth with little effect. I did some research and decided to find a natural shampoo containing argan oil. I decided to give this a try and am so glad that I did! This is the only shampoo I want to use. My fiance is always commenting about how soft and shiny my hair is and that he loves it. My hair is below shoulder length and when I use this shampoo it rarely gets tangled and is easy to manage. My hair has shown noticeable growth and I&#x27;ve noticed that my bangs need cutting much more often. The thin spots are beginning to fill in and I am absolutely thrilled with the increased hair growth. I also use the Renpure argan oil conditioner and am equally impressed with it. My search is over for the perfect shampoo and conditioner for me and I will make sure I never run out of it! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After reading and researching about sulfate free, organic shampoos and conditioners I carefully selected Renpure because I loved what I was reading. However, I&#x27;m not exactly blown away by this shampoo. It lathers well, my hair feels clean, but I was expecting my hair to be smooth, less frizzy and less dry being that it was sulfate-free and had Argan Oil. My hair felt as if I had washed it with just another cheap shampoo. Not to mention I find the smell of this shampoo to be terrible. I&#x27;ll be keeping this just for days when my hair doesn&#x27;t need to look all that great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and the matching conditioner for 2 months now.  I was so excited to read the reviews of claims of thicker fuller hair, as mine is very fine and limp.  My hair is still fine and limp and now a disgusting mess of grease.  It&#x27;s revolting.  I tried to give it time for my hair to adjust, but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s just an oily, greasy mess.  I&#x27;ve had to wear hats to cover this mess.  The only upside was knowing I&#x27;m using less chemicals on myself and down my drain.  I&#x27;m throwing away the last third of the bottle, I can&#x27;t take it anymore.  I won&#x27;t go into the eye-watering &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; as others already have.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the company (Renpure) and want to support them, but this product is just gross on my hair.  If you have fine or limp hair, don&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> Just like with the conditioner, I love this shampoo, never buying top brand shampoo anymore!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has stopped the constant dry itch from cold weather!  Its a life saver for me and will definately get the conditioner to go with it.</li>
    <li> I found this product at Target for $4.99 for a 21.5 oz which is 33% more than what&#x27;s for sale here for two for almost $18.00! I got mines (shampoo &amp; conditioner for 4.99 each! ) look at your nearest Taget store it may be on the shelf!</li>
    <li> Smells great and if you have curly hair it makes the curls look beautiful. BUT I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this if you have oily hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the conditioner  for over a year and I love it. My hair is wavy (tends toward frizzy), but this shampoo really helps it. My hair overall feels stronger and it looks shinier. The only gripe I have is that it can build up, but I&#x27;be started doing an apple cider vinegar rinse every other week and all is good now. I highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and it&#x27;s fragrance!!  I first purchased this at a discount store because it&#x27;s natural and the smell is light after you wash it.  I&#x27;ve read reviews good and bad about this shampoo and the matching conditioner.  I have fine hair, ends are damaged from YEARS of coloring.  I have noticed that my hair is softer and doesn&#x27;t look as damaged.  Common sense should tell us that NOTHING is going to completely erase the damage that we&#x27;ve done to our hair, but certain products can help out with our hair not looking AS DAMAGED.  And I believe this is one of those products that can help.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but I do condition it every day.  All products work differently for each person.  I personally love this shampoo and the matching conditioner.</li>
