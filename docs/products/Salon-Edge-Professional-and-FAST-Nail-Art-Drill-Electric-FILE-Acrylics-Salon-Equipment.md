      <li>Voila, it opens and the bits that came with the machine do fit.  </li>
      <li>All in all the drill and the bits worked absolutely fabulously  with the manual speed control.  </li>
      <li>The bits don&#x27;t fit, the instructions didn&#x27;t help, and I tried to plug it in to see if it ran at all</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>This drill is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I received my drill  today was excited until I been playing with this for almost two hrs and can&#x27;t figure out how to put in bits...can someone pls help me????</li>
      <li>I have had a couple of different Professional Nail Drills and this one is the best I&#x27;ve used!</li>
      <li>I love my new drill!!</li>
      <li>so u may need to turn it off to cool.</li>
      <li>I doubt I will ever need to turn it to full speed.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve only used the Salon Edge file once, but I loved it.</li>
      <li>This is just fast, smooth and easy to</li>
      <li>this was a suprize when we found this drill at this cost, we ordered it and love it, We use it daily in our nail salon and now we need to place orderes for more for our nail techs</li>
      <li>I have needed a new drill for many years.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use and very efficient.</li>
      <li>but it was pretty self explanatory to use!</li>
      <li>Now that I know how to use it, this is a very good quality drill especially for the low price.</li>
      <li>It also packs a powerful punch.</li>
      <li>and I love it so far.</li>
      <li>cause the other one I have its good but no manual control.</li>
      <li>I would not trade it for anything I let other use and they loved it also</li>
      <li>If you twist the grip on the wand it opens the Chuck so you can slip the bit shaft right in.</li>
      <li>last thing, if this thing lasts for a few years then it is perfect.</li>
      <li>far, we strongly recommend this.</li>
      <li>This item has a great value, very economic and works as well as the more expensive machines.</li>
      <li>I really love my new drill getting ready to open up my own salon and needed a new drill.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>you very much</li>
      <li>a note for first timers</li>
      <li>I got my nail file the first expected day of delivery, which was nice.  </li>
      <li>However, only able to use one.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this nail drill as my first drill to start learning how to do acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>I have so name brand for twice the price that comes with less bits, so I feel very satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>This is fast, quiet, and if you make sure the bit is all the way in or just a very short shaft shows you will get very mild vibration even on a high speed.</li>
      <li>For everybody else&#x27;s information and to save everybody the headache make sure the silver tip piece that&#x27;s right after the purple grip is screwed or tightened all the way down</li>
      <li>; the blue cover looks cheap from the photo</li>
      <li>Pull out the mock bit and insert one of the real bits.</li>
      <li>Having no experience this drill really helped me a lot.</li>
      <li>Only issue I had was that the bits that came with the product didn&#x27;t fit the drill.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great drill. A year later and it still works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this item in December, by April it stopped working, sadly I could not return it to the seller because the guarantee had expired.</li>
    <li> Comes with many tips.  However, only able to use one.  Took to a nail salon and they weren&#x27;t even able to switch the tips.  Would be great if it all worked.  Contacted seller and would not replace.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I just got mine.  The bits don&#x27;t fit, the instructions didn&#x27;t help, and I tried to plug it in to see if it ran at all and it didn&#x27;t.  There is no number to call for assistance either.</li>
    <li> I use drill every day. When delerved something loose inside but, I had to use it could not return.  Changing bits was a challenge intell I figured it out( no instructions) . This drill is not ment to last for years it works perfect for nails. When it breaks I will purchase another one. For the price buy product  who has 300 or 400 hundred dollars to spend on a drill!!</li>
    <li> This saves my wife a lot of time when doing her acrylic nails... I&#x27;m no expert but she likes it!</li>
    <li> I have needed a new drill for many years.  Kept himming and hawing not wanting to spend alot of money that I thought I had to, to get a great drill.  I&#x27;ve only had this drill a short time but use it regularly and it meets all my expectations. Have been doing nails for over ten years, and this drill does everything that I need it to.  Very happy with the drill AND all this bits that came with it.  I have so name brand for twice the price that comes with less bits, so I feel very satisfied with this purchase.  So far, so good.  Will write a future review if I experience any problems.</li>
    <li> I got this machine after I looked up all the other machines on Amazon. The price was good... I mean you can find some others cheaper of course,but they won&#x27;t perform as well as this one does. It works wonderfuly.I highly recommend this machine.</li>
    <li> I have worked as a licensed nail tech for six years and this nail drill is one of the best i have ever purchased. It is easy to use and very efficient. It also packs a powerful punch. I would definitely recommend this products for any profession looking for a good product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I do recommend this to everyone.its just like the professional ones at the salons. only thing im upset about is that the black knob doesn&#x27;t stay on(the knob to adjust the speed).and I received a bent drill bit.</li>
    <li> We had it among many brands. We have seen many others from colleagues. This is the best choice in term of pricing and usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;We had it with careful instructions also came in the emails besides the user guide. Very helpful and good communication from the seller. In fact one of the bits have a bit, just a bit difficulty to plug into the socket. Oher bits are ok. But after a few times using, we get used to that and it does not bother us anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The facts that it runs both by pedal or hand switch; quiet compare to other brands; compact; two direction rotating; the blue cover looks cheap from the photo but in reality it is really high quality material. All of that with the good price deserve a five stars.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, if this thing lasts for a few years then it is perfect. We will keep posting if there is something happens with that.&lt;br /&gt;So far, we strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it am??? There&#x27;s no instructions, nobody to contact.  Does anyone have this and is there some magical trick?</li>
    <li> this was a suprize when we found this drill at this cost, we ordered it and love it, We use it daily in our nail salon and now we need to place orderes for more for our nail techs</li>
    <li> This item has a great value, very economic and works as well as the more expensive machines. Recommended good product.</li>
    <li> The picture is different from what I received. I believe it&#x27;s called false advertising. Would lke to purchase a dfferent kind. They say I gotta pay to send it back too. My money is very limited.</li>
    <li> I really love my new drill getting ready to open up my own salon and needed a new drill.&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can manually control my speed cause the other one I have its good but no manual control.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of it  it works great the only problem is that it does not work on the first light only when u place the setting on the 3rd light</li>
    <li> I am a nail tech and a drill machine is very important to me. I like to use the pedal and the pedal with this machine is very sensitive. You barely step on the pedal and it feels like its going on full blast. I probably won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> How in the heck do you, put the pieces into the drill it self???? The medal pieces that are to drill the nail.. Can,t seem to in a hold of a single per[[ASIN:B005UKMFOO SALON EDGE Professional Nail Art Drill Electric FILE Acrylics Salon Equipment FAST]]son for help with this</li>
    <li> Nice for home use don&#x27;t think I could use it in the salon however I bought it for home</li>
    <li> This product disappointed me.  It worked fine for 5 months and then just stopped.  I had to purchase a another nail drill so I went with a different manufacturer. Hopefully this will help others.  I only used it every other week and it only lasted 5 months.</li>
    <li> I own a beauty school and purchased 3 of these but because we didn&#x27;t use them until we taught acrylic nails the didn&#x27;t get used....well that being said they sat for a few months and the warranty expired. We used them less than 10 times and ALL 3 Broke. I never let a student use them unattended and know for myself that they were used properly. The speed adjustment would stay on high with no way to turn it down. THEN one of them started melting the box right above the name plate on top(FIRE HAZARD) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I threw them away for safety. THE COMPANY DID NOTHING TO REPLACE THEM BUT I REALLY WOULDN&#x27;T HAVE TRUSTED THEM ANYWAY.  Hands down these are bad. 3 drills gone bad in 10 uses. I got BURNED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indiana Cosmetology Academy.</li>
    <li> I wore acrylic nails for about 20 years and did them myself for about 10 of those years. I never used an electric nail file. After 15 years, I decided to put them back on. I had them done at a salon, but after trying 2 salons, and not being happy with the results, I decided to do them myself. All that manual filing made me remember why I quit wearing them! Anyway, I&#x27;ve only used the Salon Edge file once, but I loved it. Fortunately,one of your customer comments helped me change the bits...I don&#x27;t know if I could have figured it out by myself. Like they said, there were no instructions for that, but the file is great and I love it so far. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the little sand paper drums won&#x27;t go on the mandrel, so I just pushed it down as far as I could and used it like that.</li>
    <li> i actually bought this unit on multiple times here on amazon...always something wrong whether it&#x27;s too noisy or it shakes badly so had to send it back multiple times..finally when i got a good working unit then after 3 months the unit stop turning on completely..how convenient after the 3 months warranty is over!!! I love shopping on Amazon but this is the first time i have a bad experience on Amazon...you get what you pay for! so u better off buying the UP 200 and it should last you 10 years than 3 months!!</li>
    <li> this was better then the ones at school I would not trade it for anything I let other use and they loved it also</li>
    <li> I would recommend this nail art drill electric File to anyone who&#x27;s looking for an easy one to use at home or work. Works great!</li>
    <li> I wish if they have negative star that I will give them -2 star. This chunk is work only two weeks, wonder it made from China. Customer service is unfriendly and helpless. Trust me and don&#x27;t wais your money. Never buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I Just Love this machine!  I have had a couple of different Professional Nail Drills and this one is the best I&#x27;ve used! It has a great speed range. My old one cost me over $150 and didn&#x27;t come close to this in any way. This is fast, quiet, and if you make sure the bit is all the way in or just a very short shaft shows you will get very mild vibration even on a high speed. This is just fast, smooth and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;But, this is a great machine and the wand is sturdier than the others I&#x27;ve had. I doubt I will ever need to turn it to full speed. Just half speed is FAST!&lt;br /&gt;Just a note for first timers: I&#x27;ve seen a lot of remarks about not knowing how to put the bit in. If you twist the grip on the wand it opens the Chuck so you can slip the bit shaft right in. Once it&#x27;s in, just twist it back to the original position to lock the bit in.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this nail drill. You can&#x27;t go wrong, and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I got my nail file the first expected day of delivery, which was nice.  Everything was in bubble wrap to keep it safe, I had all the pieces. The foot pedal didn&#x27;t work, but I think that may be a user error.  All in all the drill and the bits worked absolutely fabulously  with the manual speed control.  I&#x27;ve used it only a few times but I had no trouble with it. It was a little confusing to change the drill bits because there are no instructions  on that.  But there is a review on here that perfectly explains it all.  I&#x27;ll give it 4 out of five stars because of the foot pedal.  I just don&#x27;t know why it won&#x27;t work.  But over all, this works wonderful for filing off acracrylic nails. It doesn&#x27;t stop or slow down when you apply pressure to the acrylic which is exactly wwhat I needed. It takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s not hard to use by any means.</li>
    <li> Have ordered a couple of drills in the past the didn&#x27;t get the job done at all. This drill is worth every penny! It is everything and more on how it was going to perform. Very well made not cheap in the least bit. Look forward to using this drill for many years.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product good Price and works great. Perfect for someone who wants to use for themselves or for clients. I do recommend this drill.!</li>
    <li> I, too, spent countless days trying to change the bit.  It says to turn the colored plastic area below the silver metal to R or S.  Well, what u need to do is really turn it until u hear a loud click.  It takes some muscle power to turn it enough to hear the click.  Voila, it opens and the bits that came with the machine do fit.  U don&#x27;t have to go look for other size bits! To close, turn in the opposite direction till u again hear the click!  Also, the machine is powerful enough that the drill keeps going and doesn&#x27;t slow down to a crawl, as some have stated.  It does gets quite warm so u may need to turn it off to cool.</li>
    <li> Works great!!&lt;br /&gt;Received it within the time frame I was given!</li>
    <li> It comes with no instructions trying to figure it put i br0ke the piece and had to end up buying a new one</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the quality of this product.  It was much sturdier than I was expecting for the price I paid.  Very nice!</li>
    <li> this was very supprising its a professional product for a low price. works great out the box and is easy to use</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and works great</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars not 5 bc it took me nearly 2 hours to figure out how the bits go in thanks to the \\&quot;instructions\\&quot; having no instructions on how to put the bits in. For everybody else&#x27;s information and to save everybody the headache make sure the silver tip piece that&#x27;s right after the purple grip is screwed or tightened all the way down or it will keep the teeth from opening all the way up and allowing you to stick the bit in. After you make sure that&#x27;s tightened you can turn the purple grip to \\&quot;R\\&quot; and it should \\&quot;release\\&quot; the mock bit it came with. Pull out the mock bit and insert one of the real bits. Turn the purple grip to \\&quot;S\\&quot; and it will \\&quot;secure\\&quot; the bit and keep it from coming out. If its hard to turn the purple grip back and forth or it won&#x27;t turn I had to unscrew the silver tip a few times and fiddle with the grip to get it to work good. Other than this I think this drill is great for the price and beats spending a ton of money on different ones. I hope this helps a lot of people and saves them a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail drill as my first drill to start learning how to do acrylic nails. Having no experience this drill really helped me a lot. All though the directions were complicated the reviews from other people who purchased this really helped me. Now that I know how to use it, this is a very good quality drill especially for the low price. I love my new drill!!</li>
    <li> It works well, however it vibrates too much. I have a Kupa and I needed a back up drill, this will do for now.</li>
    <li> Love it! Only have used it 2 times so I&#x27;ll write another review after some time! Great product though, I was hoping for instructions included but it was pretty self explanatory to use! As a nail tech so far I would highly recommend this drill!!</li>
    <li> This is the best machine I ever used .I love it.The price is great and operation good if you compare to the UP200</li>
    <li> Bought this for beauty school. It worked out great! Only issue I had was that the bits that came with the product didn&#x27;t fit the drill. So be prepared to possibly have to go buy new bits. (You should anyway just to get some nice ones to start with)</li>
    <li> THANK YOU SAPHIREYES FOR YOUR KIND HELP ON THE CHANGING OD BITS. i THOUGHT MY NEW UNIT WAS DEFECTIVE UNTIL I FOUND YOUR INSTRUCTIONS. WENT RIGHT IN!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this electric file! It is very quiet, the handpiece is light-weight. A soft touch is needed, allowing the drill to do the work for you. In fact, if you try to apply more pressure, it will slow or stop itself preventing you from going deeper than intended or from creating hot spots on the clients nail. Almost didnt buy do to low price (much less expensive than other 2 I have had) but saw the one lonely review and decided to try it. Happy I did! This is much more efficient and is 1/3 of the price that I have spent in the past.</li>
    <li> I agonized over whether to spend the additional $&#x27;s based on the RPM&#x27;s of the machines on the site. I opted to spend the extra money and get a machine that had 30,ooo RPM&#x27;s.  Just got the machine today, opened the box and the flimsy instructions say that the max is 20,000 RPM&#x27;s. I would have spent less money on another machine if I wanted 20,000 RPM&#x27;s. I&#x27;m very disappointed and I feel it is false advertising.</li>
    <li> i order it for my friend because she work at a nail salon&lt;br /&gt;and she love it&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
    <li> I received my drill  today was excited until I been playing with this for almost two hrs and can&#x27;t figure out how to put in bits...can someone pls help me????</li>
    <li> Unit came dead on arrival, but the company made it right and sent a replacement power supply.  The replacement works well and it came with a lot of attachments.</li>
