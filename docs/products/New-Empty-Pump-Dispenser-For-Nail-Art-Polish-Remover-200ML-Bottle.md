    <li> This is perfect !&lt;br /&gt;I know there are bad reviews on here about the acetone evaporating and all but it works perfect for me. It&#x27;s fast and easy. Comes very in handy since i love to change my nail color very often. I recommend it. Besides, how much cheaper could you possibly find something like this for ???</li>
    <li> I received broken and when I let them know they wanted pictures and evidence... $$ in the trash... wish it would have worked...</li>
    <li> Very bad did not work at alll</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I wanted and ordered</li>
    <li> Handy little thing, lol</li>
    <li> This leaks way too much</li>
    <li> I used it once and the straw piece inside had already split a little so I had to flip that around to get it to work properly again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very handy.Beautiful color.Its very convenient to use and put away without messing up your nails.Thank you.</li>
    <li> Nice price but it leaked. It got knocked over and I didn&#x27;t notice for a few days. When I did, it was empty. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Wished it would have been a glass bottle.</li>
    <li> had a big hole on the bottom of the bottle</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but the acetone spilled all over my table and left a ugly mark on it. I do not recommed thos product.</li>
    <li> i use this for my brush cleaners for makeup. its awesome.</li>
    <li> Horrible trying to deal with the seller.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work longer than 2 months.</li>
    <li> this is great! helps me not spill the remover lol. It reminds me of the alcohol dispensers at the doctors office and have considered buying 1 for alcohol and one for my hydrogen peroxide as well.</li>
    <li> This bottle was a lot larger than I realized.  It will hold at least a full bottle of nail polish remover.  It is not practical for one person doing their nails at home due to evaporation of the polish remover.  I ended up tossing it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> The top is not very secure it leaks. Definitely not for use with nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> When I first got it in the mailbox, it didn&#x27;t worked right away. I did wait a long while for this product, and I was so excited when I got it, but like i said, it didn&#x27;t function right away. I had to start tinkering with it to get it to eventually work, but then (idk how) the plastic stick ripped. Had to tap it with duct tape to get it to work again. It&#x27;s working now, but was a hassle!</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;but has to be pumped more then twice before each use for acetone to finally come out /:</li>
    <li> Great little bottle w/ cap &amp; pump!</li>
    <li> This is tiny, I though it was plastic and taller just like the picture shows but it&#x27;s like 2 inches and rubber. Took too long to arrive.</li>
    <li> I do my mani and pedi at home and this pump action bottle have save me from spilling nail remover more than onces</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little cheap looking, but it works great! Well worth the cost</li>
    <li> Nice alternative to getting the remover on your finished nails and ruining your work as you&#x27;re completing your other hand. It does leak a little, so set it on a small towel.</li>
