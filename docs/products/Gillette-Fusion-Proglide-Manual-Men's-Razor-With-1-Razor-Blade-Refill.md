      <li>This is really nice razor, gives smooth shave.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a great shave from this razor.  </li>
      <li>It is important to note not to go against the blades on your towel and arm or you will cut the fibers/hair.</li>
      <li>Now i&#x27;m used to hearing all the gimmicks abt 3 blades and 5 blades and battery operated razors, but this razor was extremely smooth.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>

      <li>but well worth it in this package</li>
      <li>Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor handle is angled just right.</li>
      <li>After the blades are completely dry, I run the blades over my forearm *with the blades* to sharpen them with my own skin.</li>
      <li>I was able to use one blade for a year last year using this technique.</li>

      <li>I refuse to use any other kind.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say here.  </li>
      <li>No more nics no matter how hard I might press in the morning not paying attention and a great smooth shave.</li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this, as I do not feel a significant upgrade over the 3 blade Mach, and most importantly, the refills are very expensive.</li>
      <li>It glides smoothly with minimal effort.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the new razor for a couple of months now and have yet to get a nick.  </li>
      <li>and I was sold completely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands, but after the second use, with each shave extra, it was becoming less comfortable.</li>
      <li>No more cheap disposables for me.</li>
      <li>No other razor compares.</li>

<li> It gives a very close shave without irritating the skin.</li>
<li> the cartridges are a little over priced .</li>
<li> only complaint is that the 5-blade is wider and it is harder to shave the crease behind the ears.</li>
<li> Wish the slick strip lasted longer as the blades way outlast it</li>
<li> My beard is extremely hard.</li>
<li> It gets me the cleanest shave with the least irritation.  </li>
<li> can beat it for a close shave little bit expensive</li>
<li> bought it so i could get a deal on a video game.  </li>
<li> That says a lot since he had overgrown facial hair because he hated to shave.  </li>

    <li> Thought i was buying the battery operated one but it still works great for what i got. I prefer the battery ones though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor on sale with coupon for my husband and he just told me it was the best razor he has EVER used.  That says a lot since he had overgrown facial hair because he hated to shave.  ALL others ripped his face to shreds.  Its nice to see his smooth skin again.</li>
    <li> Works OK. Purchased it to save some money on a different item. The blades are overpriced as you would expect.</li>
    <li> I refuse to use any other kind. No other razor compares. Definitely worth the price! It glides perfectly and reduces the chances of razor burn. No cuts either!</li>
    <li> Best razor you can get In the market for sensitive skin .although the cartridges are a little over priced .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female and I love these razors for shaving legs and underarms. They glide and don&#x27;t snag. The shave is nice and close.</li>
    <li> Purchased it in a promotion, as my old mach 3 was worn down. I cannot recommend this, as I do not feel a significant upgrade over the 3 blade Mach, and most importantly, the refills are very expensive.</li>
    <li> I am a women that uses this razor with the same blade for one year. This is the best razor I have found for armpits and leg hair. After I use it, I rinse it out and take it out of the shower. I shake it out and rub it on a towel *with the blades* to dry out the blades. Leaving water on the blades is what reduces the sharpness. After the blades are completely dry, I run the blades over my forearm *with the blades* to sharpen them with my own skin. It is important to note not to go against the blades on your towel and arm or you will cut the fibers/hair. I was able to use one blade for a year last year using this technique. Better for the earth. :)</li>
    <li> bought it so i could get a deal on a video game.  I have one already and love the razor.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  It&#x27;s not just for men.  You can&#x27;t even feel yourself shaving.  No more cheap disposables for me.</li>
    <li> This razor gave me the closest shave I ever had. From what I hear,the PROGLIDE POWER shaves even closer. I&#x27;m going&lt;br /&gt;to try it next.</li>
    <li> This is really nice razor, gives smooth shave. I liked it a lot.Would buy again in the future and that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> But one use of a trial razor sent via mail by the maker and I was sold completely. No more nics no matter how hard I might press in the morning not paying attention and a great smooth shave. Wish the slick strip lasted longer as the blades way outlast it but this is a great shave!</li>
    <li> This razor was surprisingly great.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a great shave from this razor.  Now i&#x27;m used to hearing all the gimmicks abt 3 blades and 5 blades and battery operated razors, but this razor was extremely smooth.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I think that Gillette Fusion Proglide is the best. My beard is extremely hard. I&#x27;ve used other brands, but after the second use, with each shave extra, it was becoming less comfortable.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to try a 5-blade razor and was impressed with the engineering of this product.  I wish I&#x27;d tried it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head and was getting too many nicks from my old 2-blade Excel Sensor.  I&#x27;ve been using the new razor for a couple of months now and have yet to get a nick.  Based on my 2-blade experience, I expected a 5-blade would plug up even worse because the blades are closer together, but that is not the case - the design allows you to easily flush away debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the 5-blade is wider and it is harder to shave the crease behind the ears.</li>
    <li> For WeeksExcellent Razor. Will Continue To Purchase In The Future If Great Deals Are Found. Been Using Same BlaDes Fur</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor handle is angled just right. It glides smoothly with minimal effort. It gives a very close shave without irritating the skin. I like the bonus Razor Blade Refill.</li>
    <li> can beat it for a close shave little bit expensive but well worth it in this package was a extra blade</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say here.  It works exactly as you would expect.  I don&#x27;t use anything but Fusion Proglide.  It gets me the cleanest shave with the least irritation.  The only downside is the replacement blades are expensive, but what replacement blades worth their value aren&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> This product is labeled &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With 1 Razor Blade Refill,&amp;#34; so one would expect to find (1) a Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with (2) 1 Razor Blade Refill. However, there is only one razor blade total. The quality of the product is great but I paid for two razor blades, not one. I never would of purchased this had I known...</li>
    <li> These last a LONG LONG time. Well worth your money. Rarely do I cut myself. I found out just now they have a brand-new version so will be buying those after I run out of my supply.</li>
    <li> I like it because it gives the best shave I&#x27;ve had in a lifetime!  But I&#x27;d like it a whole lot more if it didn&#x27;t require me to sell my firstborn child to pay for it.</li>
    <li> Lubricating strip is too oily at first and doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;Blades catch and pull.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving head too big, can&#x27;t follow contours of your face.&lt;br /&gt;Refills are too expensive, you are better off with a twin blade disposable.</li>
