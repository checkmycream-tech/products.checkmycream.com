      <li>it won&#x27;t solve your problems, but you&#x27;ll be clean and relaxed and smell good after your showers.</li>
      <li>It really is a wonderful, sweet, delicious scent, and not as strong as many of their other soap scents.  </li>
      <li>decided to do what I call the true test of a good bar of soap (which BTW no bar soap has passed until now).  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>soap is made with a wax layer on top of the soap brick, which, depending on how the bars are cut, you may get some in your bar.  </li>
      <li>Lovely in deed.</li>
      <li>it smells better than anything on earth.  </li>
      <li>I Washed the Kids soap more than anything.  </li>
      <li>I like the added touch of the honey comb on top.</li>

      <li>and I love the honeycomb.  </li>
      <li>If you love honey you will go nuts for this like I did.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.  </li>
      <li>If you need more lather, use a bath pouf.</li>
      <li>I love turning it over to the honey comb side and using it to scrub hands and feet if there is any roughness on them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a bath product junkie and my latest cravings</li>
      <li>Love this soap.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this soap.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s more for the look than anything.</li>
      <li>I got this soap recently, love the smell.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;It feels lovely and leaves you smelling yummy...</li>
      <li>It smells so good and leaves my skin smooth and feeling fresh!</li>
      <li>Lathers nice and you feel clean after using, what more could you ask for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite cool weather scent because it smells warm and</li>
      <li>It lathers up nicely, and rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>It smells like yummy sweet toffee, but it also has a floral scent in the background that just mixes nicely with the toffee.</li>
      <li>i already wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with this soap in the store, but thought maybe it smells better unwrapped and when wet.</li>
      <li>luscious little honey comb is actually good and silky when used in the shower, I had to try it, and it smelled too good!</li>
      <li>And we are clean too!</li>
      <li>was my first Lush purchase because it was the best smelling soap they had in the store.  </li>
      <li>Of course I always make sure to follow with a strong antibacterial soap and a post-shower alcohol disinfectant, but the sweet memory of Honey I Washed The Kids</li>
      <li>If you like sweet things, you&#x27;ll LOVE this soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sweet (but not too much), like warm toffee with some citrus to it.  </li>
      <li>I admit that it smelled a bit better after showering with it for the first time but still found myself reaching for my \\&quot;Sexy Peel\\&quot; over this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love lush products!</li>
      <li>It feels so smooth going on.  </li>
      <li>It is a sweet soap, but the hints of floral stop it from becoming a tooth ache.</li>
      <li>It even comes with a layer of real honycomb on the top, although this is mostly for decoration.  </li>
      <li>I love good smelling soaps, and this one is terrific!</li>
      <li>, soaps up well, lasts longer than you would think and makes skin smell good and feel soft.</li>
      <li>after reading all the good reviews, i went to the closest lush store 5 hours away from my home.</li>
      <li>It lathers up into a rich, sudsy froth that leaves your skin feeling smooth and supple.</li>
      <li>The smell is so sweet and smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is really rich, creamy and skin friendly.</li>
      <li>Smells like sweet caramel and honey, and it&#x27;s so rich and creamy on the skin.  </li>
      <li>The hype of this soap is too great, and I was let down very quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m tempted to save it for special occasions.</li>
      <li>That should help with the lather and the \\&quot;I don&#x27;t feel clean enough\\&quot; feeling, especially if you&#x27;re used to lots of lather and a good scrub.</li>
      <li>It leaves you feeling as sweet as honey.</li>
      <li>Not only does it make you feel super clean, it makes you smell gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>Some people think the smell is too sweet, but used with water (rather then just smelling the soap) does soften the smell.</li>
      <li>This soap is beyond just honey, it exudes caramel, vanilla, orange creamsicle and sweet butter.</li>
      <li>Like sweet toffee and honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t like sweet smells</li>
      <li>This soap smells so sweet, like honey toffee.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you like sweet things, you&#x27;ll LOVE this soap. It smells amazing - like toffee or creme brulee. It&#x27;s also moisturizing and the smell lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> I have filthy children.  Filthy.  I&#x27;ve tried to instill good habits - cleanliness is holiness, after all - but with little success.  They seem to have an affinity for dirt, and their mother won&#x27;t allow me to dress them in  Tyvek coveralls when they venture outdoors.  The boys also dislike bathing, although I must admit my insistence on 5-times-a-day probably doesn&#x27;t help.  I had hoped to overcome their lack of enthusiasm with Honey I Washed The Kids Soap, but no such luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, I was very impressed when I tried this remarkable soap myself!  I love lathering up in the intoxicating smell of this super-sweet stuff, and the honeycomb side is a delightful novelty that&#x27;ll put a smile on the face of even the most jaded of soap users.  Of course I always make sure to follow with a strong antibacterial soap and a post-shower alcohol disinfectant, but the sweet memory of Honey I Washed The Kids Soap lingers in my mind.</li>
    <li> This should really be edible, because it smells so darn good! This soap is beyond just honey, it exudes caramel, vanilla, orange creamsicle and sweet butter. I personally dislike soap, and only use it to wash my hands; I never use it in the shower, simply because almost all soaps I have tried sucked moisture out of my skin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This luscious little honey comb is actually good and silky when used in the shower, I had to try it, and it smelled too good! I love turning it over to the honey comb side and using it to scrub hands and feet if there is any roughness on them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is really rich, creamy and skin friendly. Sometimes I find myself going to the bathroom bringing it up to my nose and smelling it. Lovely in deed.</li>
    <li> This happens to be my boyfriend&#x27;s absolute favorite soap, I can barely manage to drag him out of the shower when I buy this soap. I love, love, love lush products! They all have a killer lather and wonderful fragrance mmm... delicious.</li>
    <li> Such a great, yummy scent that&#x27;s moisturizing as well as long lasting! It feels so smooth going on.  I actually look forward to using it again and again.  So far my newest favorite from Lush.  This company from Canada has many great products.  I look forward to experiencing them all!!</li>
    <li> The honeycomb texture takes some getting used to, but this sweet-smelling soap is worth the learning curve. If I could buy the entire wheel of soap, I would.</li>
    <li> This soaps SMELLS wonderful and I love the honeycomb.  I don&#x27;t know how much it costs in the States - I live overseas, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey where I am.  So, for the money, I expect it to last awhile.  I bought a pretty good-sized chunk and it seemed to disappear in less than a week.</li>
    <li> This soap is one of the best-smelling soaps around, but comes at a price. The bars are very small, and with the total cost coming to about $9 a bar (with shipping) I&#x27;m tempted to save it for special occasions. If you can afford the luxury, go for it, otherwise you will feel as though you have been ripped off!</li>
    <li> This soap is absolutely wonderful and smells like caramel or dulce de leche, but  unfortunately, it also goes away really fast.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and the smell is both very strong and long lasting, but the bar, for the price, just simply doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
    <li> I bought this at LUSH in S.F. and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out as I love honey.  No dissapointment here!  The soap (and I hate to call it that) is soooo creamy and smooth and really does soften the skin.  If you love honey you will go nuts for this like I did.</li>
    <li> after reading all the good reviews, i went to the closest lush store 5 hours away from my home. i had a pretty big list of items i was interessted in. i only left with about 20 % of them. i already wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with this soap in the store, but thought maybe it smells better unwrapped and when wet. so, i used it in the shower this morning - it left my skin feeling sticky and weird. i also can&#x27;t see the awesome smell everybody talks about. mine does not smell like caramel, toffee, and honey - rather like my old aunt&#x27;s linencloset, which was stocked with all kinds off odd-smelling soaps. a little hint of honey sweetness does come through... but to me this soap is not worth its price, and i would never buy it again</li>
    <li> Like the Fresh Farmacy, I bought this soap based on the reviews and ended up giving it to a friend at work.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love most of Lush&#x27;s products and, to my husbands chagrin, end up spending a lot of money on their online products but when I got this particular soap I just couldn&#x27;t get into it.  I admit that it smelled a bit better after showering with it for the first time but still found myself reaching for my \\&quot;Sexy Peel\\&quot; over this stuff.  I ended up giving it to a friend that I work with but only after it had been passed over my three other girls in my office...I&#x27;m just not getting the \\&quot;heavenly scent\\&quot; that this item was described as having in previous reviews.</li>
    <li> The other reviewers are not kidding when they say this soap smells heavenly.  It really, really does.  I could sit and smell this soap for ages, it&#x27;s just so pleasurable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cleaning factor of the soap, it did a great job and I didn&#x27;t notice any dry skin after I used it.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin, but it does tend toward the dry side, and some soaps seem to be harsher and more drying than others. This one gets a major thumbs-up from me and my partner.. cleans well, smells out-of-this-world, and is more gentle than some other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think our next Lush splurge will include a block of Honey I Washed the Kids.  :)</li>
    <li> Just try and stop yourself from wanting to take a bite of this.  Caramel-y and sweet... like lathering up with that old &amp;quot;bit o honey&amp;quot; candy.  This soap will have you hooked.</li>
    <li> LUSH&#x27;s Honey line (Honey I Washed the Kids, Ma Bar, Soft Coeur, Honey Bee Bomb, etc.) is my FAVORITE!!  I L-O-V-E the Honey I Washed the Kids soap more than anything.  Not only does it make you feel super clean, it makes you smell gorgeous.  Some people think the smell is too sweet, but used with water (rather then just smelling the soap) does soften the smell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and will definitely buy again... and again... and again!</li>
    <li> This is a scrumptious honey/caramel soap. It cleans and lathers very well, but is not as harsh as normal soaps - skin feels quite soft afterwards, not like normal soaps. I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say it&#x27;s a moisturising soap, but it certainly does not make skin drier than before showering. And the best bit is the scent - just gorgeous! But not an overpowering or lingering smell. It makes the bathroom smell great as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried several LUSH soaps, and this one is by far my favorite!!! The smell is so sweet and smooth. It leaves you feeling as sweet as honey.</li>
    <li> It smells so good you think you could eat it. The bar itself feels creamy to the touch. This is one of their best bars. A must own.</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this with my last Lush order.  Wow!  It smells so good and leaves my skin smooth and feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> I love good smelling soaps, and this one is terrific! &lt;br /&gt;Yummy, soaps up well, lasts longer than you would think and makes skin smell good and feel soft. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A good splurge if you love great soaps!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap after getting the L&#x27;Occtain Honey Bear. I&#x27;m very into honey-scented things, and was looking to broaden my horizon with the Lush products. After getting this, I did enjoy the fragrance, but at the end of my shower the bar started to smell from honey and sour milk. It was like the sweetness melted away and the rest of the bar caught up with it. The little piece of honey comb slipped off with the second use, and the bar probably lasted a good three weeks. Every little bit of water melted the bar. I set it in my shower, and the smallest of drop of water that clung to it deteriorated the bar. It would have lasted longer had I put it into a container. It was an okay soap. I would get it again, but now I know what I&#x27;m in for. The hype of this soap is too great, and I was let down very quickly. If you are looking for excellent honey soap, try the L&#x27;Occtain products...especially the Honey Bear!</li>
    <li> All I can say is mmmmm...This is the most delicious soap ever!  Smells like sweet caramel and honey, and it&#x27;s so rich and creamy on the skin.  It even comes with a layer of real honycomb on the top, although this is mostly for decoration.  I&#x27;d recommend peeling it off before using.  Overall, my favorite soap!</li>
    <li> The smell of this is just so addicting. It smells like yummy sweet toffee, but it also has a floral scent in the background that just mixes nicely with the toffee. I like the added touch of the honey comb on top. It makes a great soap stand in the tub. Just set your soap up on the honeycomb side and it won&#x27;t get soggy and melt so quickly. Definately a keeper.</li>
    <li> This soap smells so amazing! It&#x27;s very sweet (but not too much), like warm toffee with some citrus to it.  In fact, the bar I have right now has been used/worn away by about 1/3 and it seems like the citrus is a little more pronounced.  The honeycomb thing is nice to scrub with, but I would&#x27;ve rather had it ALL soap!  It is very softening and soothing to the skin.  It&#x27;s not at all \\&quot;girly\\&quot;, so everyone can use it.  Try pairing this up with a butterball bath ballistic and you&#x27;ll have incredibly soft, sweet smelling skin!</li>
    <li> I got this soap recently, love the smell.  Sweet but not too much.  My kids like it a lot too, they pretend that they are washing up with candy.  Lathers nice and you feel clean after using, what more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> Honey I Washed The Kids was my first Lush purchase because it was the best smelling soap they had in the store.  It really is a wonderful, sweet, delicious scent, and not as strong as many of their other soap scents.  As a cleanser, however, it didn&#x27;t perform as well as I hoped.  It didn&#x27;t lather or feel like it washed my skin as well as other soaps, nor did it rinse off thoroughly afterward.  It left me feeling slightly greasy -- maybe someone with dryer skin would like it better.  The Lush line is irresistable, so I found my first experience with it kind of disappointing, but I would still like to try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> This soap is perfect for pampering yourself for a special occasion.  It smells absolutely delicious (you will want to eat it), and feels silky on your skin.  It leaves a slight scent that&#x27;s somewhere between vanilla ice cream and honey, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin or leave it greasy.</li>
    <li> this is the best Lush soap.  i&#x27;ve been a lush addict for a good 6 or 7 years and once upon a time would routinely drive to canada and come back with hundreds of dollars of Lush (yes really).  honey i washed the kids is tied for first place with the now-discontinued Flower Market.  they are both a similar creamy soap, this is not the more clear soap, it&#x27;s the milky type. it smells better than anything on earth.  my only complaint is the bars don&#x27;t last as long as i&#x27;d like. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;this soap is made with a wax layer on top of the soap brick, which, depending on how the bars are cut, you may get some in your bar.  not the dark layer, but the layer that looks like honeycomb.  you do need to peel this off and throw it away, it can get a little sticky if you try to wash with it.  but it&#x27;s pretty easy to gently peel off pieces once you&#x27;re in the shower.  if you do it dry it doesn&#x27;t work very well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;almond snowflake is another nice soap in a similar genre to honey i washed the kids.  and more recently the christmas spice (or something like that) was really lovely.  i happen to like the creamy soaps better than the clear based ones.  if you don&#x27;t like sweet smells the olive oil soap is really nice, and there&#x27;s middle earth which is a little scrubby and more musky (not in a bad way) in smell.  the rose/peony bar is really nice (also creamy based).  i personally don&#x27;t care for the soap called icon - it doesn&#x27;t lather as well and i&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;lush will make you happy.  i&#x27;ve successfully converted many friends.  it won&#x27;t solve your problems, but you&#x27;ll be clean and relaxed and smell good after your showers.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin slightly sticky feeling (not in a bad way, it disapears in a few minutes). The scent is light enough to not be overbearing (though it smells stronger in the shower). It does help if you have slightly dry skin. Overall, I really liked this product and plan to savor it till the end.</li>
    <li> Let me first say this soap smells delicious.  Like sweet toffee and honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap does not dry my skin at all.  A bar soap that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin is unheard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do what I call the true test of a good bar of soap (which BTW no bar soap has passed until now).  Don&#x27;t gasp in horror...Honey I Washed My Face With It!  Yes, ladies and gentlemen... I washed my face with this soap.  I&#x27;m one of those with sensitive skin on my face and it doesn&#x27;t take much to irritate it and cause a breakout.  But, I thought my hands feel nice...not dry...let&#x27;s try the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft and not the least bit dry after using this soap.  That&#x27;s not to say if you decide to try it you&#x27;ll have the same experience.  Everyone is different.  I can only speak for myself.  Love this soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is delicious smelling and makes your skin smell like cookies! I love Lush products - not so big into bath bombs or bubble bars, but their soap, hair bars, lotions, powders and henna are all awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snowcake avail around Christmas is one of my all-time favorites!</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m puzzled by another reviwer&#x27;s comments on this product. Perhaps she received a piece from a bad batch? I have skin that isn&#x27;t dry at all..its very soft and often oily &#x3D;( This soap did a wonderful job of cleaning, with no \\&quot;oily\\&quot; residue. LUSH soaps don&#x27;t have as much lather as other soaps. If you need more lather, use a bath pouf. That should help with the lather and the \\&quot;I don&#x27;t feel clean enough\\&quot; feeling, especially if you&#x27;re used to lots of lather and a good scrub. This soap is actually a little drying. Not REALLY drying. its more more of a \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; type feeling. I&#x27;ve had a few of these... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Honey I Washed the Kids\\&quot; is a DELICIOUS soap that smells like honey toffee with a hint of orange...Oh gosh, its a little slice of heaven. Its not sickly sweet either, but if you don&#x27;t like many sweet scents you may not like this, obviously... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It feels lovely and leaves you smelling yummy...I wish it lasted longer on the body though &#x3D;( If you want to smell more like this soap, use Soft Couer Massage Bar as a body moisturizer after you bathe, or use it as a solid perfume.</li>
    <li> This soap smells so sweet, like honey toffee.  It makes my mouth water!  It goes a bit faster than regular soaps, but i found it helpful to rub the soap into a cloth and then use the cloth to clean yourself - instead of losing all that soap down the drain.  There is a concentrated honey strip on one end of the bar, not at all sticky or waxy.  I think it&#x27;s more for the look than anything. Great for guys too.  Lush also sells a bath bomb in this scent.</li>
    <li> This, along with Lush&#x27;s soothing bath bombs, is a wonderfully &lt;br /&gt;fragranced honey soap.  However, the price has doubled since &lt;br /&gt;January 2006 with no explanation.  Is there a honey shortage? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rate this soap 5 minus 1 star, where the 1 star is for the &lt;br /&gt;recent overpricing.</li>
    <li> Tough to understand unless you are near one of their outlets.  I found this soap in the Macy&#x27;s on Michigan in Chicago.  It is highly addictive.  They send samples of other soaps and things with each order, and we like almost all of them.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It smells just like Dulce de Leche.  Normally I&#x27;m a shower gel person, because most soaps dry out my skin.  But Lush soaps never seem to.  This one is really creamy.  It lathers up nicely, and rinses clean.  But the best thing is the fragrance:  it even lingers for a while in the morning on your skin (not forever though, I have to use a vanilla body lotion or Demeter Birthday Cake fragrance to achieve that sweet smell all day long).</li>
    <li> I absolutely L-O-V-E this soap! It smells only of good things: intense caramel, golden honey with subtle notes of floral, as real honey does, and toffee- mouthwatering, buttery toffee to round it out. It is a sweet soap, but the hints of floral stop it from becoming a tooth ache. It is a bit pricey, but all worth it. You will, yes, WILL become addicted - so if you&#x27;re on a budget, don&#x27;t start a habit you can&#x27;t keep. Cheers! and happy showering.</li>
    <li> This soap Should be called \\&quot;Honey, I ate the kids\\&quot; because that is what you want to do with it.  We use HIWTK exclusively in our house.  My baby has only ever been washed in it. I wish I could have a perfume, and lotion and deodorant and EVERYTHING in this scent.  And we are clean too!</li>
    <li> Loved the scent and feel of this soap! I&#x27;m a bath product junkie and my latest cravings have been for anything honey scented and this soap is wonderful.  My only complaint is that it did use up pretty quickly and left a mess in the dish.  I&#x27;d not leave it in the shower next time.</li>
    <li> Lush&#x27;s Honey fragrance smells just like toffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite cool weather scent because it smells warm and comforting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my top three Lush soaps (along with Bertie and Noriko). When used with Honey Bee Bomb and Soft Coeur Massage Bar the wonderful scent lingers all day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap.  The smell is heavenly, but it melts really quickly and is quite expensive. That said, it&#x27;s a must in my home.</li>
    <li> This soap is to die for! It lathers up into a rich, sudsy froth that leaves your skin feeling smooth and supple. As other reviewers have noted, it just doesn&#x27;t last all that long, hence the four star rating.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The scent is reminiscent of vanilla and caramel, but it is not too sweet. I was not that excited when I came across it in Lush, because the scent reminded me of an oversweet cupcake. However, once I brought it home and used it, the overbearing scent dissipated and I was left with a wonderfully subtle, almost sexy, smell that lingered on my skin and in my bathroom for over a day. It is absolutely heavenly.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The honeycomb can also be used for gentle exfoliation on the body. And when I say gentle, I mean *gentle*. It is not going to give you the same results as rubbing down with a sugar or salt scrub, but it will slough enough dry and dead skin away to make dry skin feel a bit more soft. I did not use this on my face as my skin is a bit on the sensitive side, nor would I recommend using it on the face. However, it works wonders on the rest of the body.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!! It has been my favorite since I discovered it in a Lush shop overseas.  I was so happy to be able to find it online and still be able to enjoy it stateside.  I have no problem paying the price for good products but I may have to say bye to this one because it&#x27;s getting just a bit too much.  I know that I used to pay half this price for this product in the store and even online...it&#x27;s a good product but the price is getting to be too much for me.</li>
    <li> addictively yummy....i&#x27;ve been using this soap since i bought it from lush a couple of years back. you just cant get enough of the buttery toffee scent</li>
    <li> this stuff smells SOOOOOO GOODDDDD!!! lol I had a freind try and steal it from me that how good it is. This is one of the better smelling stuff LUSH has.</li>
