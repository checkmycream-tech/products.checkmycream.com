<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 5 for this price range. The oster 76ers are the best clippers hands down, but you pay for them. I have been a loyal Wahl customer for 20 years, saw these and I&#x27;m glad I did. They have a strong motor, no clatter, very sharp. Nice little kit that comes with a trimmer and all the guards. I cut my hair from home every week or so, we will see how they are in a year.</li>
    <li> Awesome kit, the best set I ever had!!</li>
    <li> To date these are the best clippers I have owned for the price. I cut my hair and my three year old sons. I&#x27;m glad I did not read the comments and skip this deal steal!</li>
    <li> Was a perfect set until the 3rd time used, dull, hair sticking, not cutting properly! I am the only one that has hair cut with it. I&#x27;m 57 and don&#x27;t have much hair. Trust me. Not good! Now I can&#x27;t return it!</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair a lot and these babies are nic3. What a go to product.</li>
    <li> Gives the best shave ever. With proper maintenance, see this product lasting long. So far the blades have been performing perfectly.</li>
    <li> this trimmer really gets the job done. Before the Andis,  i suffered from major razor bumps but now using the Andis... i dont have razor bumps anymore. its a real clean and  close shave!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great clipper and trimmer. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love it just what I expected great product great service. Will use in the near future and reccomend to family and freinds</li>
    <li> I purchased another Andis clipper as my son needed one for college.  Considering the price with a trimmer, I decided to get this kit. It gets job done, but a bit noiser to the previous Andis.  Compared to other clipper brands, I have more confidence with the Andis.</li>
    <li> The Andis 29115 hair clipper and trimmer are amazing!  We previously owned a ConAir clipper which left my husband&#x27;s hair looking really shabby, he is in the military, so his hair has to be within regulation...aka, perfect.  The value of the Andis clipper is way above the asking price; the clippers cut incredibly evenly, it&#x27;s easy to use, and light-weight.  We&#x27;ll never go back to ConAir or the barber again! :)</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best sets that you can buy, especially within this price range. The clipper works very well and the trimmer shaves close enough to leave a slight 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. If you want to help your cause, I recommend using \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a pre-shave splash which will help you to get a closer shave. All in all, good stuff!</li>
    <li> Useless. after using them for 2 months, the motor started making weird sounds. then stopped working.</li>
    <li> Fair quality. The clippers have already become a issue and I&#x27;ve only had them 2 week.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to start cutting my own hair and I was not disappointed. The clippers do get a little hot, but i only noticed it when I took the guard off and actually touched the blade. I&#x27;m black, so I have short and course hair and with the guard on you can&#x27;t go wrong or fell the heat of the clippers. I gave 4 stars because the trimmer is weak and didn&#x27;t really do a great job on my outline and beard. Other than that, the clippers are great and I&#x27;m pleased w/ my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great for home use not quite built for professional work. Trimmer is not real sharp but it can do the job if used for personal home use. Clipper is great best I ever had, it&#x27;s sharp, strong, and cuts real well. Attachments are also pretty good and the price was very good. Definitley recommend it for home use or any one practicing their beginer baber skills.</li>
    <li> This combo is a great deal as it pays for itself after a couple of uses. I see though that other customers are having issues with trimmer especially.  All that is needed is a simple and quick adjustment of the blade and it will provide the sharpness that is desired... unscrew the blade, loosen the two smaller screws on the underside of the blade and slide the bottom or moving blade up a bit but not too much. Be careful to make sure it doesn&#x27;t go past the top blade. Tighten the screws and put the blade back on and it should be good to go. Side note: when cutting  hair, turn the clipper and trimmer off while its not actually on your head... i.e, while combing or brushing hair. This will keep it cooler longer. Have fun.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper and trimmer is just perfect for my daughter. She is just starting out cutting hair while going to college. The Andis 29115 kit has everything for her to get started.</li>
    <li> Quick Take: First clippers ever owned. I would say great performance after 2 cuts. Not easiest to clean, especially compared with what i was hoping.     Numbered system for spacers are good and easy to switch. Maybe a bit flimsy but really, how strong do you need them for 99% of hair. Carrying case is good to keep them together but not as far as organized. Everything is loose inside of the pouch anyways.   Overall please with product and price. Just cant say too much since this is the only one i have owned, and second i have ever used.  Im happy not spending 20bucks for a basic haircut at a barber when i can do it myself with these nice cutters in half the time and it pays for itself in about 3 haircuts with no long wait in between haircuts. i can do touching up every few weeks.    A great product especially since you get so much. Happy customer</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews about noise and the unit getting too hot, I was a bit apprehensive.  To the naysayers I can only say, \\&quot;hogwash!\\&quot;  This thing is a piece of cake to use, there is no noise, the unit doesn&#x27;t heat up (at least during my haircut).  It comes with an instructional video that was quite useful if for no other reason than confidence in doing our first haircut at home.  I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I was to get a haircut, on a lazy Sunday afternoon in the comfort of my own home.  My daughter gave me the haircut and it was every bit as professional as I get in the salon.  Of course, I just shave the whole head with a 2 blade and I am good to go.  For [...] bucks, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Please note, you do need the clipper for the haircut and the trimmer around the edges.</li>
    <li> The Trimmer just doesn&#x27;t give you a clean cut but, I have only used twice.&lt;br /&gt;Will see how it progress.</li>
    <li> Much better than the piece of crap from Clairol.  But I have only used them once.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Great Clippers and Trimmers and sharp responsive I might even use this for barber school soon</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great purchase for the money. The clippers work AWESOME. The guards are great if your cutting someones hair who&#x27;s head is sensitive. I have a set of clippers I use for close cuts so I mainly use the clippers to blend and trim. For that purpose they&#x27;re awesome. Slight downfall in this combo is the trimmer. It&#x27;s a little weak IMHO. If your expecting it to perform like the Andis T-Outliner, just go out and get you the T-Outliner. Other than that I&#x27;m VERY happy with the set!</li>
    <li> Both clippers have performed up to the other reviews.  I am happy with both.  I cut my own hair and my sons hair.</li>
    <li> The trimmer pulls your hair and it does not remove all of the hair.  It leaves a lot of stubble and I am not happy with the product at all.</li>
    <li> They both can be a little more sharper.  But that my just be</li>
    <li> After having gone through 5+ clippers (most hand-me-down) over the past 9 years I finally purchased a set that perform professionally.  These clippers are quiet; they do not scare my children; they do not pull hair.  We LOVE these clippers.  I cut all of the hair in my family of 6, and I am very happy with this purchase.  I would recommend these to anyone.  The kids loved watching the instructional DVD that comes along with it and I even learned a pointer or two.  I appreciate that these come in a nice case for storage.  Two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Yes. I order Andis 29115 at Amazon and it came in on time, and product is what I expected to get it. Sure I will order again or let friends and family order this product at Amazon website again. I am order many many products and merchandises with this website with no problem at all. Thanks. Brandon Le</li>
    <li> Excelent product!&lt;br /&gt;Very usefull and work every time</li>
    <li> These came with a LOT of gadgets! Unfortunatly the actual product, the clippers, were junk!  I give my husband and son buzz cuts and I had to keep going over the same hair over and over.  Had to buy another pair.  Would not recommend these!</li>
    <li> A solid pair of clippers/edgers. Granted, I&#x27;ve only used them twice so far, but I&#x27;ve been satisfied with how efficient and quiet they are. Easy to clean and take care of, I highly recommend these clippers/edgers. Only thing that the set could use is a small mirror, but other than that it has everything you could need to give yourself a great haircut.</li>
    <li> I have to start by saying that I am a black male. The trimmers were not sharp at all, they seemed to be doing more pulling than cutting. I had to go over the same section several times before the was cut short more to my liking. Even then, they did not cut as close as I exspected them to.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers were better than the trimmers hands down. I don&#x27;t feel that they were the sharpest pair i&#x27;ve come accross. At the same time, I feel that you are yetting what you pay for as far as they go.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel that this clipper set looks nice but not worth the money to spend on. You will be highly disapointed with trimmers but feel that the clippers are at least descent. I would have given them a rating of 1 star if not for the clippers.</li>
    <li> I never cut hair before and was able to do it with ease. the instruction video was very helpful and the clipper combo was easy to use.</li>
    <li> one of the best trimmers for hair cutting and body grooming</li>
    <li> Greater starter set.  Gave to our sons so they can learn to cut hair without ruining their dads. It did everything they wanted. All types of hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fully cut the stragglers.  I think it is ok but perhaps the most professional model would have been better for me.</li>
    <li> its a great set, i first used it on my son, cuts really well light weight, not to heavily, i didnt use trhe trimmer to edge him up... he&#x27;s 4 years old just not ready yet. especially a new sharp trimmer. only one downfall is that in the discription in states it comes with a super fine t blade on the trimmer,false. the blade is really not fine at all, so u might end up buying a new blade that is shape.  overall a great set,</li>
    <li> The main clipper head gets too hot to continue using after just a few minutes.  In addition, it does not cut as well as the previous clippers I have used for years (a cheap Walmart special).  I cannot recommend this pair of items.  Not up to the usual Amazon standards.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> If I could rate a zero I would.....one turn on and it stopped working.,...turned on for one second and burnt out. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Spend a little more and get the Andis Barber Combo!!!! Works excellent! Recommended by my former barber.</li>
    <li> Product works great, price was cheap for two shavers. THis package also included a dvd for cutting hair. This is a great package, worth buying...</li>
    <li> Way a waste don&#x27;t cut my husband facial hair it just runs over it</li>
    <li> the main reason i brought this product was for the price and trimmer combo. The trimmer is trash. the clipper is trash. dont spend your money on this GARBAGE!!!! Im returning them as i type this review out..</li>
    <li> Ok so i bought this to cut my kids hair and was quite disappointed, clipper blades don&#x27;t cut hair as good as i was expecting them to. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong Andis is a very good brand but this set just not working for me very well.</li>
    <li> This product works as described. I give it 3 stars because it gets hot pretty quick. Other than that I like this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and upon opening package there was a crack on one of the clipper. Doesn&#x27;t appear to be new.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I cut my own hair now but I still go to the barber for the line. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t line good at all.</li>
    <li> the trimmer doesn&#x27;t really work for the outline of the hair which was the main reason I bought it, for the trimmer. everything else works fine.</li>
    <li> I bought these and tried to use them but it pulled out my hair more than cut it.  These are severely under powered and do not have any power adjustment which made them worse than worthless to me.</li>
    <li> These are junk.  The very first time I tried to use the trimmer, it would not even function.  The Clippers are very slow and don&#x27;t work well either.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and my clippers gave out finally after 13 years. This so far is an amazing bargain and they work great.</li>
    <li> This purchase did not quite turn out to be the quality I expected.  Andis is normally the highest grade when it comes to trimmers/edgers &amp; for clippers, among the top 3.  This combo turned out okay, but it doesn&#x27;t fit the usual bill by any means</li>
    <li> I really thought that the trimmers would be much sharper than these. They are practically worthless out of the box when trying to line my hair.</li>
    <li> i bought these for my boyfriend as a christmas gift and he seem to like them. he still uses his old clippers to cut but he was very excited about receiving them.</li>
    <li> The clipper is good but it gets hot (specially the blade) after a while of using it, which is not very comfortable. The trimmer is OK. It is quiet which is good but it leaves some hair after the first use and you need to go over the trimmed area a couple of times to make it cleaner.    The plastic case doesn&#x27;t look to be of a good quality (you can easily feel it by just grabbing it). My unit is made in China. I had a Wahl unit which was made in USA. I feel that the Wahl clipper had a better quality overall.</li>
    <li> The motors didn&#x27;t work in either the clipper or trimmer in the first kit we received.  After an exchange, we are thrilled so far.  Both work great. Video was very helpful. One con - the combs cut a bit shorter than expected in comparison to the same numbered combs at the barber or salon.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these, perfect for a guy that loves to fade and line up his edges.</li>
    <li> These are the worst clippers I have ever bought.I had a andis T-edger for ten years and never had any problems so I thought these will be an upgrade but they were not I had to return them.Find something else anything would be better.</li>
    <li> The set was not as bad as the service received from Electronics Warehouse so beware if you are dealing with them.  I purchased these due to some of the reviews and the price of couse as normally I use the Andis Styliner Trimmers and this time was the first set of Andis clippers that I&#x27;ve bought, don&#x27;t ask me why I waited so long.  Let me state, I am a black male so obviously there is a difference of hair texture here than some of my other brothers and sisters with a finer texture of hair. However after first use, the trimmers cut well, but snag on my beard and are not sharp enough to properly outline my goatee, of which I&#x27;m very proud! The clippers also snag a bit when cutting so you have to go slower upon first pass then can cut at regular speeds.  But after cutting half my head they were noticibly hot so much that I jumped when they touched my ear.  They&#x27;re ok, but if you have lots of heads to cut like I do, mine and 3 boys, haircutting time takes a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now the good stuff and my joyous experience with this company Electronics Warehouse.  Amazon is excellent in taking care of their customers yet these people should not even be in partnership due to the level of service they DON&#x27;T provide.  I told them the story of the clippers and first they will try to hit you with a 15% restocking fee, IF the product has been opened.  How else will you know if you like it or not dweebs! Then they tell you if you return it, you will also be hit with the \\&quot;free shipping cost\\&quot; that they paid up front and you have to pay the shipping to return it, which cost me another $10.20 with the lowest shipping package available. Talk about pushing someone completely away from you.  I usually don&#x27;t do these reviews but this one needed to be said so no one else has to waste their time, efforts, and money dealing with a subpar product and the service that the provider doesn&#x27;t provide.  Moral of this story is...trust your instincts.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this set after my 2nd Conair clippers went bad. I&#x27;ve had 3 Conair clippers, two of which went bad, and the other too awkward  to use. So I decided to bite the bullet and buy something other than Conair. It arrived super quick, and tested them out a few days after receiving them. I&#x27;ve got to say, it is extremely quiet, cuts hair smoothly. And the included plug in trimmer is a super plus. The Conairs came with battery powered trimmers that I never used, but this plug in unit is awesome. It also comes with a barber cape, which the Conair failed to do so, well one did come with one but was so flimsy and cheap, it resembled a plastic bag with a cutout for your head. Overall, extremely satisfied, works awesome, runs smoothly and quietly. Only con is that I couldnt use the Conair combs (the ones that attach to the clippers).</li>
    <li> For the price of this trimming set, its amazing. I&#x27;d rate this 6 stars if I could. You get more than enough accessories, and it gets the job done very well. The trimmers are well built, heavy duty, and ergonomic, so its nice to hold on to. They&#x27;re quiet, and trim very nicely.    A great product, and the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Andis kit. I wanted something substantial that would clip very coarse hair without overheating. This is the one!! The price is just right. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a low-end professional clipper instead of a high-end economy clipper. It&#x27;s worth every penny and has already paid for itself in terms of now unnecessary barber visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructional videos are very useful and VERY easy to follow. They don&#x27;t skips steps...you actually watch the entire cut with narration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the PERFECT Christmas present. Saves time, and it&#x27;s fun to cut my man&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I already own an Oster Classic 76 (which I LOVE), but purchased this set as a travel set to trim my own hair while traveling. It cuts very smoothly and very well (much better than i anticipated). Easy to maneuver when cutting my own hair, and lighter and more compact  to carry in my carry-on.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered this through my account. All I know is that he was looking for quality but affordable clippers and that he is more than happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Four out of five star!!!:-)</li>
    <li> Great for grooming and the dvd was very helpful as well.  They help me save a penny or two from going to the barber shop every week.</li>
    <li> i ordered this as a gift for a son. he said andis products is the best for home care use</li>
    <li> These clippers worked better than i imaged they would. They left my boys hair lookn like they lef the barba shop. They got so many compliments i am the only barba they want now. Thanks Andis</li>
    <li> yes, this is the one. I will never use all of the attachments, but it&#x27;s great to chose the one ylou need.</li>
    <li> The only reason I can&#x27;t give it one star, is that I haven&#x27;t tried the larger clipper yet, but if it is anything like the smaller one get ready for one painful experience. I&#x27;ve never had a $50 &amp;#34;quality brand&amp;#34; trimmer RIP out just as much hair as it cuts...in fact I AM going to give it one star because I DID pay almost $50 for it and I have actually been avoiding shaving because of how painful it is. And this was not a one time thing. on SEVERAL occasions I just had to shave and I forced myself through the pain of this device...DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> i got this for xmas and the first thing i did was cut my fiance&#x27;s hair...im proud to say i did an amazing job even tho id never cut a man&#x27;s hair before. great product, amazing quality, and the perfect gift for someone who is extremely interested in hair cutting and styling.</li>
    <li> Andis 29115 Promotor + Hair Clipper and Trimmer Combo 27 Piece Kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: $48&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motor: Pivot Motor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we liked: It&#x27;s powerful, smooth and low vibration clipper and trimmer.  Impervious to wet hair not getting cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disliked: Surely there must have been something to not like on this product. Thought an USA made product would have had better quality materials. For most part, some of the internal components are made of plastic. In addition, the lower blade on the trimmer can be easily moved out of position while cutting thick hair. I have been disappointed by Wahl and Andis internal components thus far, think my next purchase will be either a Oster or Babyliss.</li>
    <li> Quiet but powerful! Gives a great cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since 1992, and after using these clippers for the first time I realized I&#x27;ve been using the wrong clippers over the last 23 years.</li>
    <li> We have used these for 2 years so far with good results.  Video training is okay, mostly helpful, but you will still have to learn as you go in terms of angle/speed/which guard to get the results you want.  We like these and they cut well.  They are not loud, but they are not super quiet either, maybe like a kitchen mixer on medium low.  The kids don&#x27;t mind the noise until you get near their ears (I have heard quieter models in a barber shop).  The motor noise does not interfere with watching videos during the haircut.</li>
    <li> I have had this for 2 month and it works great. I use the trimmer a lot more since I have short black hair. So there are too many accessories that i will probably never use on my self. I had to adjust the blade for the trimmer so I could get clean lines and edges on my beard and sideburns. Its light weight and doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I like it because it is lightweight and smaller than the normal one.  Ok</li>
    <li> these are extremely lightweight... look and feel cheap.. my husband hates them! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I purchased the And is Clippers as a gift , another great deal from Amazon.  The clippers work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon😊</li>
    <li> As advertised, gives great haircuts with a lighter weight!</li>
    <li> the Clippers are great but the liners suck they just drag on your skin don&#x27;t cut real well the box it comes with is nice and has everything you need to to cutting hair</li>
    <li> These clippers are very good. I have gone through very thin hair to very hard rough hair and it goes through like butter. I would highly recommend this product. The only thing is that I haven&#x27;t try in wet hair so I don&#x27;t know how it would go.</li>
    <li> The clippers provide a good clean cut.  Having both the trimmer and clipper makes for a fantastic hair cut experience.  Was absolutely amazed at how quietly the clippers and trimmer run.  A excellent product especially at the price.  Not sure how accurate the guards are though.  Used a 2 guard on sides and back, which left considerably more hair than a 2 guard used by my former local barber.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice cut!  So many gadgets I don&#x27;t know which to use.</li>
    <li> Finally, a clipper and it&#x27;s attachments, along with a groomer, that works and stay in place.</li>
    <li> Works great and great price</li>
    <li> Do not buy, poor quality..I do not recommend. i didn&#x27;t returned because i opened and used. i had waste my money...</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t be happier!!exactly what I was looking for; for m partner!!Comes with everything you need! recommend to all young teens and adults!!from beginners to professionals!</li>
    <li> Was not the trimmer blades on most Andis trimmers so now I have to by new blades. Very disappointed with this purchase</li>
    <li> these clippers are great i use them to cut my hair every week they are much better than clippers i have bought before,and is is a very good brand and they cut really well saves a lot of time .hoewever the liners could be better the liners aren&#x27;t top shelf but i guess they were a throw in so i can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> This clipper set is great. Works well and it comes with a great selection of attachments not to mention a nice carrying case!!</li>
    <li> I trimmed my beard with this kit. It worked. If you have a beard it will most likely work for you as well.</li>
    <li> its Really Good any one can use it simply but i like the small piece to be more strong you can use it by yourself to cut your hair</li>
    <li> Been using these for one and one-half years ... and I&#x27;m looking great! Hmmm ... 18 months of cutting my own hair ... 18 x 15$ ... $270 saved! well, minus the 50 for the Clippers ... $220 in my pocket :)</li>
    <li> Cuts sharp got mine for only $20. The next day Amazon went up on the price to $50. So happy I got mine for only $20. Lol</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and wanted to get a really good pair for a good price and these are the BEST CLIPPERS FOR THE PRICE! Totally Rock on!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with clippers.</li>
    <li> We will be returning this. I pulled it out of the box to cut my son&#x27;s hair, and it is a very uneven cut, and he said it was &amp;#34;pinching&amp;#34; his head, which he never complained of when I used previous trimmers.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> The clippers are awesome i always use andis products. These are the second pair of andis clippers i bought in 2 years.</li>
    <li> I expected more from an Andis Clipper, these came with horrible blades.  They barely cut the hair.  Very frustrating coming from a good company like Andis.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is not as good as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s not as precise as I wanted or expected.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used the hair clipper yet but I&#x27;m sure they will be fine.</li>
    <li> These Clippers are the best. ! I Love Them.. Thanks Amazon You&#x27;re the best</li>
    <li> Very happy shopping at a time, the goods is very good, use is convenient, next time will come again, thank you</li>
    <li> Great home clipper set.  This is the best of three home clippers I have owned. It has a nice feel and lots of attachments.</li>
    <li> Perfect to have if you love to trim your own hair or beard as I do. Low noise and does not cut your skin if pressed against the skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a great price.  You can&#x27;t get andis anywhere for anywhere near this price.  usually the clippers run 75 to 150 and the same goes for the edge clippers.  This is an awesome deal and a great product.  I only have one constructive thing to say about this product, the edge clippers aren&#x27;t as sharp as they could be, other than that, this product for the price is a gem.</li>
    <li> Not much to say but it does the hair job.</li>
    <li> nice kit but i sold it</li>
    <li> Great price but these were complete crap. Firstly the trimmers were used with hair in them. REALLY?! Why go through the trouble to package it up make it look all nice and not clean the clippers. Secondly on the box it says 4X faster or powerful or something like that when I plugged the liners in there was no real power in it, completely weak. These clippers are ok if you really don&#x27;t have much of a choice but if you want a GOOD product don&#x27;t buy these spend a little extra and get something better.</li>
    <li> Do Not listen to the low ratings, This thing works Great, And no noise really.&lt;br /&gt;I took off 3 months of bread with NP</li>
    <li> The hair clipper works amazing, the trimmer however needs to go over a few times over the same place</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally satified with the clipper and trimmer. I rate it as a great value at a reasonable price and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> work awesome, husband and son like that it doesnt pull their hair.</li>
    <li> good stuff! now I can mess up peoples hair way faster . cuts hair ,and other hair like things .also cuts arm pit hair.</li>
    <li> This product has been awesome thus far. I had Excellent Delivery time and excellent Product, I am Very happy with this product and very pleased at the price!!</li>
    <li> Great clippers for a good price👌satisfy customer over here not a bad deal at all check them out for your self</li>
    <li> T- liner is not at all working, or just flimsy; it won&#x27;t even cut my husbands hair who is bald. The other one works ok but pretty flimsy, its better to buy them separate instead what you see here. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> Personally, Wahl is better than Andis and I found that out after buying this Andis clipper/trimmer.  After the first use, the clipper would not cut well.  The Wahl All Star combo clipper/trimmer was recommended by a friend who works at a salon.  I love my Wahl purchase way more than this Andis clipper.  The Andis clipper works its just not that great and feels light in your hands (cheap design).  The trimmer gets caught on scruff.  Expect to pay around $60 for a great clipper/trimmer combo that you can use regularly without bogging down.  If you read this Andis product review, move on to a different product.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I dont even go to a barber anymore. I trim, shave, cut my on hair. love this product.</li>
    <li> Not really sure on the need for 2 trimmers...they appear to trim down to pretty much the same length and the attachments are specific to each unit so you can&#x27;t interchange them. The guys at my wife&#x27;s salon supply place said the smaller trimmer would trim it down to the skin...definitely not the case. They are about as good as my $10 Wahl I replaced. They pull on the hair a little too...not bad, but not good for a new trimmer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what was in the picture &amp; how was  described . i love the item is very nice thank you so much</li>
    <li> Runs smooth. I am an African American and my hair is in its natural state. Cutting such locks can be a bear with the wrong kind of clippers. This trims the woolly beast without catching or snagging.</li>
    <li> This set is just great!  It is used in a proffesional uses and have not had any issues with the tool or atachments. very good product.  Way to go amazon with all the money I saved with this purchase.</li>
    <li> 4 star product.  Andis is a great brand for clippers.  This is a great starter kit!!!  You get everything you need to start cutting hair.  4 star product because even though it is an Andis product, it is still a basic clipper set.  There are better clippers out there, even from Andis.  But it does a great job for the price.  Solid product!  (Side note: the Andis name on the clippers does rub off when you spray the Andis cool care plus spray on it if you bought it to cool the blades.  But that&#x27;s all...still a great clipper set.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the Army and deployed this product is solid and works well. No issues even under 120 degree weather and a sand storm (just keep cleaning it-duh). All the accessories have held up with the exception of one of the plastic covers for length but I dropped it so I can&#x27;t fault the product.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers because the price wasn&#x27;t that bad, and I guess you really do get what you pay for. The motor was very weak and didn&#x27;t cut too well. I returned these.</li>
    <li> very disappointed as I cannot even exchange this product. as soon as I started using it to save hair it quit working and never restarted and being that I&#x27;m in Iraq I cannot get it replaced so hopefully others have better luck my money is hard to come by and don&#x27;t plan on buying again or recommending if I cant ever use mine.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Was a gift for my husband and he really loves it. I highly recommend it to folks. He uses it to cut my son&#x27;s hair and he is a fussy child when it comes to his hair but he sits quietly and it is over and a jiffy! Love love</li>
    <li> I decided to buy my own clippers because I have been getting buzz cuts for the past 2-3 years and it was getting expensive to go every other week for a such a simple cut.  I decided on this set, and so far they have been incredibly easy to use.  Plus now I can buzz my hair once a week, to keep it looking nice.  Plus, I&#x27;m saving a ton of money by doing it myself!  I&#x27;m very pleased with my choice</li>
    <li> First time using good product very quiet motor</li>
    <li> long lasting and shipped fast. i bought these for my boyfriend for his birthday his old ones made noise so i decided to buy these the price is right and they work nice had em over a year now.</li>
    <li> Great products! Although it can get really hot.</li>
    <li> Great quality, and cut my husband&#x27;s hair very well.</li>
    <li> The shape up clipper grab your hair but besides that I havnt had any issues with it.</li>
    <li> I have always used A Wahl hair set for my boys and husband for the last 28 years and I&#x27;m sorry I tried something new this time.  This trimmer is noisy, light and the cutting blades wear down quickly.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the way it cuts compared to the Wahl&#x27;s  so I am switching back as soon as possible and will save some money as well.</li>
    <li> The tools and pieces are excellent. Works smoothly and with no problem</li>
    <li> With the price of this item I expected a better quality. I feel it does a ok cut I still have to go over the areas quite a few times to cut all the hair. Definitely will purchase a different brand next time around which will probably be within a year.</li>
    <li> The larger clipper works very well. However, the smaller clipper is very noisy and extremely dull....&lt;br /&gt;Just buy the larger clipper on its own</li>
    <li> Already tried this product on my suns hair and mines. I love it so far and it did great no hair getting pulled or stuck. Quick and easy worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers. Not too loud and works great. I prefer the corded style over the battery as I&#x27;ve had plenty of trouble with razors not holding a charge well after a while.</li>
    <li> Great timing, great packing and it actually is been done according to what they say in the ad, great job guys! WIll recommended with my eyes shut!</li>
    <li> The Andis has allowed us to save money on haircuts.  The video is excellent.  Would recommend this to any one.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product at all. The trimmer is adiquit, but the tool pieces are cheaply made, and one of them broke apart as I was installing it for the first time of use. Not happy</li>
    <li> They are good quality and cheap and they get the job done. Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it was a little to noisy.</li>
    <li> Good at home clippers came with everything needed. I found this clipper a little weak and struggling to cut thick or slightly damp hair. This is perfect for at home use. I can only cut one persons hair at a time, due to the clippers becoming hot and un cormfortable for whoevers hair I&#x27;m cutting I listed all the stuff I have noticed bad about it all in all I would buy this agin if I had to It is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> Just try to cut my son&#x27;s hair. Clipper does not vibrate too much. So far nice quality product.</li>
    <li> Does not cut very fast</li>
    <li> It was the worst buy ever. Received it quickly but the trimmer was about to catch fire a shortly after storting using it. I am truley disappointed and will never trust Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Price is great for my needs.</li>
    <li> Omgee!!! I love my combo set and everything that comes with it. I love Andis! Saved myself a lot of money doing my own cuts!!</li>
    <li> Product was scuffed, but does not affect the performance.</li>
    <li> I open my so call brand new clipper to get ready to cut my son hair... There was hair and oil, left in the clippers... Also a screw was missing... what is this? FYI amazon... Before repackaging items to make it seem brand new... Please remember to clean the items and make sure nothing is missing... Thanks!</li>
    <li> For $70.00 I was expecting something. As far as I am concerned, I would given it a higher rating if all I would of got was the bag and a bigger bottle of oil. The trimmers are useless, period. I don&#x27;t know if someone had this before me, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend .</li>
    <li> Pretty cool they saving me money</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because they advertised the desireable &amp;#34;Pivot&amp;#34; motor being more powerful versus a magnetic motor.  On my first use the cutting depth lever felt seized and is difficult to adjust and when fully opened the motor hardly runs....so much for powerful.  The quality of the cutting heads and accessories is comparible to my Wahl kit and not even close to my Remington.  Anyway, I&#x27;m in the process of contacting Andis customer service for a return since I missed the Amazon cutoff for returns by 1 week.  Spend a little more and by a professional quality unit/brand.</li>
    <li> This article is heated very quickly, and the combs are simple and fragile material; believe, has not been a good decision for me to buy this article, however I had read comments from other buyers explaining the same problem that I have in the article.</li>
    <li> The clipper cuts very well but it does get a little hot with long usage, with a little spray of Andis cool its back to normal tho.. The t liner is great, doesn&#x27;t get hot cuts crisp lines for lineups &amp; beards with ease .. The liners are worth the money themselves.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the clipper getting hot every now and then its a good buy, you just have to keep the clipper/ t liner clean &amp; oiled</li>
    <li> The Trimmers are very dull and slow and the clippers aren&#x27;t that much better.  I received my package and was very excited but when i started to make a line for my beard it barely cut. I am gonna try to order the Trimmers that the barbers use.</li>
    <li> This Clipper and Trimmer set is awesome.  Very sharp and clean cutting.  The trimmer has a plug and comes with guards.  Most battery operated Trimmers loose cutting ability as the battery drains, not this one.  It comes with a cape but is pretty crappy - it tore after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also purchase replacement blades when they become dull - nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this set!</li>
    <li> Good solid product. Was missing a couple of parts but Amazon resolved it with me satisfactorily. Cut my son hair with ease.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Beard trimmer is ineffective and does not provide sharp lines, hair clippers only efficient with attachments. If you&#x27;re looking for a close trim or line-up do not buy these.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for the price</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend and he loves it!</li>
    <li> The andis promotor is great, it cuts very well and isn&#x27;t too loud which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These are better than the others that I&#x27;ve had in the past... Nice and quiet</li>
    <li> I bought this item because of the reviews I saw. The hair clippers motor is not strong at all. Sadly, the trimmer is actually strong and works better than the clippers. I had to stop midway, and just use the trimmer for the rest of my hair cut. Not very happy at all...</li>
    <li> Top name brand cuts very smooth doesnt vibrate heavy like many of the other brands.That is why i chose ANDIS</li>
    <li> Do not purchase. Spend that extra dollar on the traditional andis products. This package is very enticing but, do not let it fool you. I won&#x27;t even accept another one as a free gift.</li>
    <li> These clippers was a waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> Used one time and within 5 minutes, I burned my son&#x27;s neck because they got so HOT!  Don&#x27;t know if it was a defect or not, but they should be taken off the market before someone SUES!</li>
    <li> Great equipment!  I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since 1981. I&#x27;ve used many brands. This is the best for the cost.</li>
    <li> Not that satisfied with the trimmer</li>
    <li> Motor is super weak on trimmer...will not even cut a straight line...clippers are also weak</li>
    <li> I received this item and I returned it because the larger clipper had hair on it and it was false advertising because it didn&#x27;t come with the trimmer, unhappy customer so I returned it back</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the price and fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Not enough power and trimmers don&#x27;t cut close! Not happy with &#x27;em!!!</li>
    <li> my wife cut my hair with them and it was easy.</li>
    <li> Still using them years later. They still work great</li>
    <li> I am very cheap and when I saw this item for a great price, I salivated at the 2-for-1 deal! I hate WASTING  money at the barbershop, but this deal came up short in certain key ways: the hair clipper is very good. the motor is strong and it powers through my tough curly hair quite easily (minus rare snags).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trimmer on the other hand is incredibly weak! No wonder they threw the trimmer in for so cheap! It is nearly impossible to get this trimmer to give you a neat, sharp line for shape-ups, etc.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product with the mindset that you will need to get another trimmer for edges, sideburns, etc. I would NOT recommend the Trimmer whatsoever!!!!</li>
    <li> not please with item.</li>
    <li> These are by far the cheapest clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head with a set of hair clippers for the past 13 years and have gone though my fair share of them.  As soon as I opened the package and plugged in the clippers I could feel just how cheaply made they were, both the outside frame and the motor. The only redeemable thing about the set is that they came with a large array of hair guards (there are almost too many).  But seeing how I only use 1-3 it wasn&#x27;t really a good selling point for me.  My advice, save your money for a better set of clippers.</li>
    <li> I bought thse for my son and he seems to love thwm.</li>
    <li> looks &amp; performs professionally. Has everything you need. Definitely recommend    GOOD:   * Quiet, low vibration (not irritating)  * do not pull hair, sharp  * the set includes everything, even the cover cloth :)   * DVD is very basic, but sufficient    BAD: the lubricating oil leaked inside the case through the cap. I recommend keeping it in a separate place and get a different oil from the store in a different container.</li>
    <li> the clippers work fantastic. they are sharp, easy to clean and do not get overheated like many clippers do. My son stays neat and tidy thanks to the trimmer combo.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because i wanted to be able to cut my hair as well as line up the edges with one kit.&lt;br /&gt;This is possible with this set but the liner is really weak. it knicks at times. it does not cut very close and it is far less powerful than my Andis T-Liner. after i use this trimmer, you can still see short hairs in my poors quite visibly I was expecting better quality from another Andis machine but i guess i got what i paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper also does not have a very powerful motor, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great. They have plenty of power to go through the thickest hair.</li>
    <li> I expected a professional clipper. It is no better than the $14.00 type at Walmart. The blades are NOT sharp and I must go over the same spot several times to get all the hair cut.  If I buy another clipper it will be the Wahl. It is too bad I didn&#x27;t buy it locally. I could then return it for a refund. Do not believe the great reviews at the Amazon site. They are most likely written by Andis employees. Raymond Pohl</li>
    <li> The small one worked better than the big one.  The motor for the big was kinda weak</li>
    <li> best of the best that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Came right on time , I was very  satisfied..</li>
    <li> Very sharp and stylish.  Have sharp blades and very light.  Its really worth the price.  THe brand is known for it long lasting durability that is why probably there is no warranty application forms.</li>
    <li> Works well for my curtains and my carpet!</li>
    <li> Excellent blades. Quite motor. Worth the money. Trim clipper right size for the neck &amp; around the ears.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The bigger clipper still works we&#x27;ll be has gotten noisier after use. The smaller clipper had gotten very noisy after a few uses a well, and stopped working under a month.</li>
    <li> I went throught cosmatology school and had to get new clippers for a good price. These work great!</li>
    <li> Very well made product.They are quite heavy but do a great job.I would recommend to anyone that is a do it yourself person.</li>
    <li> Required some adjustment of the blades but work perfect and no issues thus far.</li>
    <li> Brand new set, but doesn&#x27;t perform as well as I expected for the price..</li>
    <li> These clippers are horrible, they do not cut for nothing and the motor is weak in them. The hair clippers are okay, but the shape up trimmers are wack. I had the original andis t outliner and they lasted for 12 years and still cutting. I just purchased another pair of those, I do not recommend wasting money on these unless you dont care how your shape up looks.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this gift and know he cuts his own hair without going to the shop. So you should buy these clippers for your guys or guys buy this for yourself</li>
    <li> The trimmer clippers were not as sharp as I expected. They do not cut as closely and precisely as advertised. Also, the lever on the other clipper was a little loose, which is not good for a keeping levels constant.</li>
    <li> very good product for cuting your hairs at home but if you live in europe buy an electric transformer 220V-110V&lt;br /&gt;you can do fades with the clipper and the trimmer is good for edges and hair designs</li>
    <li> This item does exactly what I hope it would. A must be if your into cutting hair.</li>
    <li> well they lasted about 5 minutes. Top tip check the voltage in the small print. It would have been nice if they had put it on the front page advertisement like some other brands have done. 5 stars for the clipper. No stars for me. Do you think the warrenty covers 240V. Very fast hair cut while it lasted</li>
    <li> very good item and the best service from amazon...</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> I like that it was quiet, but that&#x27;s probably a result of how week it is.  It didn&#x27;t cut hair worth crap.  I tried to do a buzz cut on my sons hair and had to start with the largest setting and work my way down to a No. 2 instead of starting with a No. 2, which is what I&#x27;ve normally done on cheaper versions from other retailers.  I&#x27;ve returned for a more powerful version.  Maybe my kids hair is just too thick.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product because I couldn&#x27;t bring my stylist with me (my wife). I deployed with the Navy in a area that does not give me much access to a barber so I hand to start doing the buzz cut, by myself. Man do these thing get close. No problems with being within regs here. Very quiet motor. Amazon was really helpful in getting these to me even in this remote area.</li>
    <li> These are certainly a step above the clippers you&#x27;ll find in Target or Wal Mart. I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair at home for quite a few years and I&#x27;ve been through a lot of  department store clippers. I&#x27;m hoping to get many years of service out of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come with a large selection of guards for both the Clippers and Trimmers. Both units feel very well constructed and solid. The Clippers do vibrate a bit more than cheaper units that I&#x27;ve had, but hopefully that translates to more power.</li>
    <li> The products are not bad for home use and the price.  One would have to invest more money if they want professional products.</li>
    <li> the clippers are great and everything else it comes with but the trimmers. the trimmers barely cut any hair which really blows! but the rest of it is fine.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t cut hair very well ! Have to go over it a few times . Gets really hot when using it .</li>
    <li> The product was more than advertised and came  with a lot of accessories  that  I didn&#x27;t expect  I would definitely recommend anyone try these clippers</li>
    <li> Good Product, Good Price - Winning!</li>
    <li> Great humming clippers. Sturdy in the hand but light weight. I&#x27;m not a barber and only trim my beard really but it makes me want to learn how to style it. Good pick up.</li>
    <li> clippers are not sharp.</li>
    <li> They are good consumer brand clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Not as heavy or sharp as their pro clippers and trimmers.  Does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> The Actual Clippers For Cutting Hair Were Great! But The Trimmers Were Honestly Not So Good They are Not Powerful at All I Would Recommend Getting Some Better Trimmers That Are More Powerful But Overall You Cant Beat The Price For The Whole Kit.</li>
    <li> One hair cut down. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I like this product that I brought from amazon,&lt;br /&gt;It works for me.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m impressed with Andis. These both seem of high quality and power, no need to adjust the frequency like those rattling clippers. This set comes with all sorts of attachments I&#x27;ll never use. The instructional DVD that came with was actually helpful for basic techniques. The oil bottle is small and prone to leaking so might be worth picking another up.  The main trimmer does get warm but not enough to bother me - if that&#x27;s an issue they have ceramic blades available. (if Andis had a ceramic set like this I&#x27;d have gotten it instead, but this price was unbeatable)&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works better than I expected, another user said it was bad but it&#x27;s good enough to trim my (thin) facial hair. I&#x27;m confident these will outlast anything I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
    <li> These clippers are not at all what I expected they aren&#x27;t sharp what so ever and the cords are very short. The only thing good about them are all the clips and accessories that come with them for the price that&#x27;s why I gave them 3 stars.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper !!!!!! It&#x27;s very smooth and easy to trim</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, only issue was that my #5 blade was broken or just made made wrong. Not to hard to skip up with a flick of the wrist so not too worried about it Everything else was great!</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is not good at all. Parts were missing and it wasn&#x27;t the product listed. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my husband and he and I are both very pleased with this set.  The first time he used the set he had a quality haircut and trim that equaled the quality that he gets from the barber shop.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> PERFECT FOR DO IT YOURSELF HAIRCUTS.</li>
    <li> Worst clippers I have ever bought. They cut my hair unevenly.  So you have go over an area repeatedly; to get an even cut.  After about a year of personal use, they stopped cutting hair all together. The trimmers work well. Going back to Wahl.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money and works well. I like the fact that it includes the cover to keep the hair off the person who is getting the hair cut.</li>
    <li> I bought these a few months ago and they look very nice but never actually cut right. My husband and sons complain badly because it hurts them so bad. Too bad because I like the look of them but will buy something else next time.</li>
    <li> My new Andis29115 combo clippers / trimmer is wonderful, it&#x27;s been used on a weekly basis since it arrived. Great piece of machinery. We all love using it. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> Entire contents  covered  in oil on arrival and trimmers bull but not so bad. A good set nonetheless</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for someone, and they absolutely love it</li>
    <li> Does not trim hair very good.  Leaves stray hairs longer than rest.  Would not recommend this produce.</li>
    <li> I dropped it on the floor after one day and the cheap plastic side broke and chipped.  Also, the guards do not fit properly and keep getting caught with the slight amount of pressure.</li>
    <li> Yes they are a very good quality of hair cutting clippers. I am very pleased with the product and the excellent service I received from Amazon, thanks.</li>
    <li> why this rating because the product work, however did not meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer do not cut clean as expected. i would recommend this product to persons with long soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;not for African who desire sharp detail clean cut</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a barber in training and these work great. They are not quick to get hot which is a good thing when i&#x27;m cutting my sons hair.  Great pick up for those who cut hair for fun. Use them on coworkers for the professional look.</li>
    <li> This razor is exacyly what i was looking for. It comes out of the package ready to use. It has all the attachments one would need to even start their own barber shop. Also the razor doesn&#x27;t need much oiling or maintenance. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my husband&#x27;s nephew and he is in love with the kit.  He is able to cut his hair and other friends with no problems.  I am glad that we purchased it for him!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for clippers and trimmers! The clippers come with a large range of size attachments, and the blade is adjustable too, so any length is possible. Both the clippers are trimmers cut really well. As a hairstylist that does a lot of men&#x27;s cuts, I would definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> Well worth the value (unlike the $15) that literally flew apart while on my head...oops! With all of the attachments one can cut any style hair.</li>
    <li> For the price and brand, i expected a lot more. The clippers seem weak and not that strong. It comes with a lot of size adapters which is good and a few other goodies. i just wish it was a little more powerful.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Been cutting my own hair for 16 years with Wahls ok results, changed up to Andis clippers for 1 day and my hair cut is so much better looking. I will keep cutting with Andis clippers. So Fresh So Clean.</li>
    <li> Works as needed. However the trimmer is not as strong as I hoped it would be. I feel like I have to push down hard or angle it a certain way to get the solid effect of lining my stache/beard the way I want to.</li>
    <li> Im not a professional barber, but it works excellently to me</li>
    <li> Great bargain, came with more than I wanted and that is fine.  Love it, would recommend to any one who wants one.</li>
    <li> Weak motor o well glad that wasn&#x27;t 100</li>
    <li> Powerful well designed clippers.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get my own clipper and trimmer.  I used it the very first day I got them.  They work great.  Looks just like when I went to the barber except now I will be saving 15 - 20.00 every couple of months which is what I used to pay.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> two clipping machines for a great price, work silent, smooth, light weight, and do my hair as if I had gone to a pro barber shop.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for six months now. It cuts hair just fine, but be careful not to give yourself a bad haircut. Always oil the clippers before and after every use. Use canola oil if you run out of clipper oil.</li>
    <li> The clippers work wonderful, I cut my hair a few times and loved it, the only downfall is the trimmers that come with it do not work very good, should put a more precise set of trimmers in there, other then that I love it</li>
    <li> These clippers are great my husband and son have professional cuts.  Its way better then sitting in the barber shop and cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, wasn&#x27;t really what my son expected. It was a gift for him. Maybe he will like it better when he uses it.</li>
    <li> These shavers do not cut Andis shavers.</li>
    <li> I love the clippers they work great i like the look and feel of them, I rated it 4 stars because the trimmers weren&#x27;t as sharp as i expected but still are a very good set of clippers, Amazon also shipped it to me very quickly, i rate Amazon 5 stars for business shipping and packaging, thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. Smooth operation, sharp, and precise. Absolutely no sticking or slowing down. Instructional DVD was informative. Everything you need to be a home barber.</li>
    <li> QUIET, QUIET, QUIET.... Love this thing, no 00 cut adjusting but it still gives you a nice low cut. And it blends with a calming hum. Must have for your Home Salon needs.</li>
    <li> I just recieved these clippers. The cutters are fine but the trimmers aren&#x27;t really sharp</li>
    <li> Wonderful set of clippers for a great price!</li>
    <li> Never have I trimmed my own hair with such ease and style. This Clipper combo works perfectly well. Now, I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber to have my hair trimmed.</li>
    <li> ridiculously slacking in power. The trimmer was getting jammed trying to cut a thin beard on my face!!! crap product.</li>
    <li> The clippers over heats and the trimmers don&#x27;t cut the are very dual so there for I&#x27;m not happy with this product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product got a 5 star reviews , do no buy this if you actually want to trim or sculpt your facial hair. I threw the box away or I would be returning.</li>
    <li> If all you want is a buzz cut, buy these and after several haircuts they have already paid for themselves.</li>
    <li> FOR YEARS I CUT MY HUSBANDS HAIR AND THEN I WENT TO WORK AND I GAVE IT UP.  WHEN I RETIRED IT WAS TIME TO SAVE ON HAIR CUTS.  THESE WORK SO WELL.  THE CD THAT CAME WITH IT WAS A GOOD REFRESHER COURSE FOR ME.  I AM WELL PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND I HAVE HAD IT FOR OVER A YEAR NOW.</li>
    <li> No problems with it whatsoever. Gets the job done and I&#x27;d highly recommend it!!!!!! Thanks for the great product once again!</li>
    <li> Happy with this item.  Good product! Very quiet. Liked the case it came in. Has came with more attachments than other clippers that I have bought.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll still need to go to the barber if you want tight lines or fade but, in between cuts to cut down cost or all around close cut for you and the kids -great!</li>
    <li> Was excited when I received the package a week earlier than expected, as soon as I started using them I was thrilled with how well they were working. after about 2 minutes they were getting noticeably hot. After about 5 minutes there was a loud pop and smoke started emitting from the clippers.</li>
    <li> Okay product.  cuts slow but eventually gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great set of hair products, it has the best tools for clipping and trimming your facial hair. You just have to watch the learning video and you&#x27;re good to go. it&#x27;s that easy to use.</li>
    <li> T line trimmer need a little bit of sharpining for a crispy edge up. The clippers cut wonderfully well worth the money</li>
    <li> The Andis clippers were fine.  However, the trimmers were a little dull to me.  I expected them to be a lot sharper.</li>
    <li> I love this item so much I bought this for a friend he says he loves the item he says it works well I didn&#x27;t regret getting it for him. Nice colour no vibration as described by other reviews</li>
    <li> They don&#x60;t cut close to me so that is a problem for me it should be already sharper from the company</li>
    <li> The last hair clippers I bought were Wahl brand and were cheaper than this from Fred Meyer.  The Wahl clippers I had before that were even cheaper from Rite Aid.  Both of those clippers were higher quality than this clipper.  The presentation is nice and the mini trimmer is nice, but the clippers are HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the end of the plastic clipper guards were all bent out of shape, which leads to an inconsistent cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Second off, the tips of the plastic clipper guards are extremely pointy and keep poking my scalp! The cheaper wahl clippers would run smoothly through my hair without uncomfortably poking my head.&lt;br /&gt;Third, they don&#x27;t cut all the hair! I usually cut my hair down to a #1 length and, after painfully going over my head again and again, I was still able to find hairs that it missed after I was finished!  Unacceptable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, stick to the proven brands that you&#x27;ve heard of, Andis has lost my business, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> blade not stainless have to keep oiled or rust occur.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband after many disappointing encounters with battery powered trimmers. We have not yet used the Larger hair clippers. I decided to purchase the Andis after reading reviews saying this way the brand of choice among men. My husband did say the blades  are very nice and very sharp but the motor seems under powered. he feels that as soon as the blades start to loose their edge they will start to catch and he will most likely look at a different brand.</li>
    <li> These Andis Clippers work great! It will take me some time to become a pro at cutting my own hair. I have no complaints what so ever.</li>
    <li> Highly disappointed. I love Andis brand clippers, but this, this is not holding up to their great name at all. I&#x27;m going to assume this clippers may be good for white males due to their hair texture, but as a black male with coarse hair, this was terrible!  The trimmer barely cut anything at all!, all it did was snag and pull at my hairs. I could not even finish my cut. I&#x27;m used to paying an upward of $50 to buy a good andis clipper/trimmer so was amazed at the price on this set and figured to give it a try. well, u get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> After using Wahl for years ,found this to be superior &amp; professional quality.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer being wired and not battery does much better job.</li>
    <li> Clippers are ok, small trimmer is worth less.</li>
    <li> These Clippers are great for my family. It saved us money in the long run and with all the attachments we all get the hair style we want. Andis is known for their professional style Clippers and with this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> THE TRIMMER IS TO WEAK FOR A GOOD TRIM.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but the times that I have used it, it did exactly what it was supposed to! 10/10 Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for a great price!</li>
    <li> At the initial testing it wasnt cutting but after a minor adjustment it works great. Very good clippers</li>
    <li> got these clippers for my bf and he loves them the only problem is they don&#x27;t give a close enough shave on the face area for him other than that he loves them.</li>
    <li> Nice duo.  Everything you need to cut hair. Haven&#x27;t used it yet... I&#x27;ll let u no.</li>
    <li> It took some time but I&#x27;d went with this set and I&#x27;m glad it did... they work well! love it!</li>
    <li> Basically rusted enough that I had hard time cutting my hair after 2 years of use. And the trimmer does a worst job that the clipper to trim, never used it.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of clippers . I cut my own hair and I have tried conair and some other brand and they all suck compared to this Andis set  . For as good as they work I&#x27;m surprised they are not more expensive but I&#x27;m fine with that . I had a set with me in Afghanistan and all my boys loved them . They always asked me to us my clippers because they do a great fading job</li>
    <li> Delivered super fast. The machines work great to cut my brother&#x27;s hair at home. Highly recommended for home use.</li>
    <li> Garbage.  Worked for 3 haircuts and stopped.  Naturally, 7 days after they were eligible to return.</li>
    <li> My husband tossed his other clippers after receiving this set for Christmas. The trimmers cut like butta!!! His hairline looks pristine and the clippers cut evenly and with no lag even when cutting my sons longer hair.</li>
    <li> Still pulls hair but has lots of different guards for each trimmer. Cord isnt long enough to use without an extention cord. But carry bag helps keep all pieces together.</li>
    <li> This pair of clippers works smooth and quiet. Well built and recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Has been working well so far. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This was very cheap considering that you get a trimmer, scissors, and some combs.They are some good Andis clippers and trimmers.</li>
    <li> Trimmers are not that sharp even after adjustments were made.. really disappointed not sharp enough ..had to get the blades cleaned and adjusted</li>
    <li> Thought these clippers would be somewhat similar to the more expensive Andis clippers and trimmers. They are not even close!!!&lt;br /&gt;Brought them while stationed overseas for something to keep me from growing a bush. They dont cut close and the liners/trimmers are worthless.</li>
    <li> Clippers cut fair, trimmer is of little use.</li>
    <li> the clippers are fine but the trimmer blade is not sharp enough. not good for edge trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it&#x27;s already broken.  It was good while it lasted.  He was using it and it got caught in this beard.</li>
    <li> I received by clipper combo sooner than the stated time, they perform quite wonderfully, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with them. I&#x27;d recommend this purchase to anyone!</li>
    <li> These Clippers are Quick Sharp and Powerful!!! I am a Barber. I love them as a Back up kit for home</li>
    <li> Great set of hair clippers for the price</li>
    <li> My wife has been cutting my hair for 5 yrs with various Wahl clippers.  We expected this Andis to be much better and were looking forward to having a trimmer as well.  However, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work and the clipper is no better than the $20 Wahl trimmers we&#x27;ve been using. Disappointed .. not worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I just tested out my clipper and trimmer combo by Andis, my trusted brand for trimmers, and I was impressed by its performance from both cutters. This is NOT a top of the line, barbershop quality set you may come to expect from Andis, but its high quality nonetheless. Everything from the carry case and guides to the cape and scissors in the pack are well made and very useful. I&#x27;m happy with this product and highly recommend it, great bargain!</li>
    <li> Good clippers also gift.</li>
    <li> Clipper  and trimmer appears used with minor scratches. A screw fell out of the trimmer as if it was previously repaired.  Not satisfied.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong...:-)</li>
    <li> The trimmer was not sharp. It barely lines up my edges. I might have to buy a whole other trimmer again.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to cut the hair of my 3 boys. The first two times I used it, performance was good, but on the third time the clippers started to pull the hair of my children, they are now scared about them, and about me trying to cut their hair, I try them a 4th time but same thing, I could only convince one of the boys, and this clippers did not help at all, so I decided not to use them again. Now I need to buy a new set :-(</li>
    <li> nothing to brag about!!!!! i thought by buying online i would have bigger variety of product and better quality but this was not the case. trimmer is useless, it dosent cut anywhere close to what a name brand trimmer should!!!!clipper was ok but get extra hot after 15 min of use...... if you consider buying this kin you might as well go to Walmart and get one there.</li>
    <li> Bought these clippers and got them in about 10 days, which is realy quick, since I live with an FPO AP address.  Both clippers work super good.  No pulling of hair and cuts great.  These replaced a set that I had for the last 2 years, and these things put my old ones to shame.</li>
    <li> I use this set and can say that I&#x27;ve actually gotten better at cutting hair since. My reason for the lacking star is, the trimmer motor seems to be a bit weaker than my other Andis T-Liner model. Still an overall good buy. No regrets here.</li>
    <li> I received this Andis 27 piece kit quickly after ordering and have used it shortly after receiving it - it works very well and is just as described. Very good product and I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> Had To Send Back. I Received a Dull pair. Was Very Weird and Crazy That It Did Not Even Cut.</li>
    <li> Clipper gets very hot when not using the attachments.  They work great, but have to watch the clippers don&#x27;t come in contact with the skin or it will burn.</li>
    <li> I have a little 10 lb dog and got tired of wasting my money having her groomed.  These work great.</li>
    <li> Great set to began your hair cut at home, the big one cuts through at 98%. And the smaller one cuts through at: 95% however I didn&#x27;t find it professional as they claimed it to be, but the good part about the smaller one specially: it is so so so quiet. Overhaul it won&#x27;t cut that much when you want to have a nice trim.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and cuts hair accurately. It&#x27;s easy to handle and allows you to concentrate on cutting hair rather than supporting the tool. The guards fit nicely but I personally don&#x27;t have much use for them.</li>
    <li> This works great! So much cheaper than taking my shih tzu to the groomer so often! Easy to toe, too!</li>
    <li> No pulling on the hair, cape included, and the T clippers cut like a boss! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> theses clippers appears to be well build, I hope they last. So far they are working okay. The price was right..!</li>
    <li> Machine lacks power. I feel that after several months of use (I cut my hair twice a week) that it will stop cutting my hair and require a lot og maintenance to up keep.</li>
</ol>
