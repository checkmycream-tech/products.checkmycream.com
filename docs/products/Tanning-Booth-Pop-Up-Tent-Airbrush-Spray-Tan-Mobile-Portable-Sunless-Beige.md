      <li>and it literally comes completely clean.</li>
      <li>Very roomy and cleans easily.</li>
      <li>Very large (booth, not wife).  </li>
      <li>Saving up for a higher quality /professional tanning tent</li>
      <li>The zipper broke on the bag the first time I tried to zip it up.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have the exact measurements</li>
      <li>But first time folding be patient and look for the instructions on inside of carrying bag, because i didn&#x27;t see them at first</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s easy to take down and travel with.</li>
      <li>The width is nice and wide, a lot wider than expected.</li>
      <li>not as big as my first one</li>
      <li>Not difficult at all to fold back up.  </li>
      <li>Folding instruction comprised of a small tag sewn into the bag with nowhere near enough detail or actual instruction to fold successfully - this is the only reason i dont give it 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>Easily enough room comfortable apply spray tan, even when requiring the odd angle or two.  </li>
      <li>first setup and take down clip broke holding rods together.</li>

<li> I highly recommend this and came within a few days</li>
<li> Pretty much sets itself up, but like other reviews, was difficult to fold back into it&#x27;s carrying bag.  </li>
<li> This tent was so much less expensive than others of lesser quality, I love it and can&#x27;t believe the value.</li>
<li> Took me a couple of tries to get it folded back up but after repeating the steps I can fold it without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had zero issues with it except a front zipper broke off, but it has another set on the other side.</li>
<li> and I hose it down</li>
<li> Had a little trouble folding it up.</li>
<li> The tent was $30.00 and a waste of my clients time as well as mine .  </li>
<li> Not sure if anyone makes them like that though.</li>
<li> The directions are sown on the inside of the carrying bag, and they were a lil confusing.</li>
<li> just read the instructions slowly to yourself and it will fold!!</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Extremely difficult to fold and put away.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
<li> now useless.</li>
<li> my clients house feeling quit embarrassed and frustrated .  </li>
<li> cause i got frustrated</li>
<li> Very disappointed with this purchase !</li>

    <li> Nice price and works well for containing spray tan over spray.</li>
    <li> first setup and take down clip broke holding rods together. now useless.</li>
    <li> All on these pop up tents are about the same, so my advice is shop on price.  This one was at a very good price point, and the quality is fine.</li>
    <li> Tent works great. Had a little trouble folding it up. The directions are sown on the inside of the carrying bag, and they were a lil confusing. Tent is perfect size for me to spray tan love it. But first time folding be patient and look for the instructions on inside of carrying bag, because i didn&#x27;t see them at first and I gave up folding once, cause i got frustrated then I found them</li>
    <li> More than half the price of another tent i was going to purchase. this one is perfect. love that it comes in carry bag.</li>
    <li> Set and and take down is so easy....I wish it was even bigger ...wider and taller. Not sure if anyone makes them like that though. Serves its purpose for the most part :) I would buy again for the price and quality.</li>

    <li> Works great. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This tent is awesome!!!!! I&#x27;ve had zero issues with it except a front zipper broke off, but it has another set on the other side. I take it outside after it starts looking dingy and I hose it down and it literally comes completely clean.</li>
    <li> The zipper broke on the bag the first time I tried to zip it up.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the size of this tent since there were no specific measurements posted. I don&#x27;t have the exact measurements but i can tell you that it is huge. This tent can easily have someone 6 feet and taller in it. The width is nice and wide, a lot wider than expected.</li>
