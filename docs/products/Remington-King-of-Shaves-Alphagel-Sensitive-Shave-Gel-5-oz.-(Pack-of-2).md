      <li>so it is perfect!</li>
      <li>He found this product and he is very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome because it is transparent so you can see where you have and have not already shaved.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried lots of gels, but this one is the best.  </li>
      <li>It works perfectly with electric shavers in the shower (Norelco) and soothes the skin well.  </li>
      <li>This the best thing out there.  </li>
      <li>It was GREAT!  </li>
      <li>But Alphagel is very good, so still deserves all 5 stars.</li>

      <li>LOL)</li>
      <li>Its a great price</li>
      <li>This slickness though is what makes it so great for shaving</li>
      <li>and you would be happy to have it in your arsenal.</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>Alphagel does it one better by including oil and a gel to provide the best shave in one product.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I am pampered, but I prefer a pleasant gel that becomes foam.</li>
      <li>But putting it on my face and not feeling any pleasant aroma, didi not please me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I thought that this was a good product.  </li>
      <li>and it was good while it lasted</li>
      <li>The shave is good and close with this gel</li>
      <li>but he just loved it.  </li>
      <li>And Lubriderm is 99% as good, is cheaper than Alphagel, and is easier on the razor.</li>
      <li>- Comes in a good sized container for a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; shaving product.</li>
      <li>Look around a bit to get a good price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>But the Remington is quite good and, for the price, might be a good alternative cream.</li>
      <li>I loved the smell of the aerosol ones, how it clung to his face after he shaved.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product for what it is.</li>
      <li>This is a good brand as well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s a good thing they were bought by Remington.</li>
      <li>The smell is good (methanol), but sometimes I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
      <li>Almost none with a good blade.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>/&gt;From a woman&#x27;s point of view, the smell is very appealing</li>
      <li>best shaving product I have used, works very, very well</li>
      <li>If I shaved right after getting out of the shower where the warm water had a chance to soften my beard, I thought this shave gel is the best there is.  </li>
      <li>best feature of this product is the tube--it&#x27;s much more environmentally friendly than a can of shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;ll be King of Shaves riding solo again, doing things in our own way.    </li>
      <li>The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  </li>
      <li>Once applied it has a nice cooling feel as it readies your stubble for shaving.  </li>
      <li>You can get a nice, close shave with it.  </li>
      <li>Its nice to purchase it this way.  </li>
      <li>He liked the glide assisted by the gel, as well as the feel of his face after his shave.  </li>
      <li>So, strictly from a functionality standpoint, it&#x27;s as good or better than anything I&#x27;ve ever</li>
      <li>Has been a nice switch away from gels in aerosol cans.  </li>
      <li>- Provides a very nice, smooth shave  -</li>
      <li>Just be sure to moisten your skin and hair well with warm water first to get the best result.</li>
      <li>Though they say it is fragrance free, there is a light, very pleasant mint scent to the gel.   </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  </li>
      <li>Great product, but the tubes looked 75% full.</li>
      <li>This stuff feels GREAT when you use it and leaves your face feeling cool afterwards, too.  </li>
      <li>Good shave gel, smells nice, makes for a nice clean shave, no ingrown hairs.  </li>
      <li>Between the Eucalyptus, tea tree, spearmint and cinnamon ingredients, the gel has a very strong scent, which my husband finds rather overpowering.  </li>
      <li>This, by far is the best shaving gel.</li>
      <li>This is a good shave gel, but nothing extraordinary.  </li>
      <li>Cartridge Shaver:  If you use a regular cartridge like a Schick Quattro, Gillette Fusion/Mach 3 or even Remington&#x27;s own (which I don&#x27;t recommend) then this is a very good gel.  </li>
      <li>Most \\&quot;gel\\&quot; shaving creams turn into foam upon application.  </li>
      <li>Love this shaving gel.</li>
      <li>and I most definitely approve. :D  </li>
      <li>Stores don&#x27;t have many of this on hand, so I get it here instead of running around looking for some.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>It can be used with Remington&#x27;s Azor 5 blade razor or even your favorite brand.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  </li>
      <li>You get a really nice, smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>Nothing works better, prevents nicks better, rinses better...</li>
      <li>The Proraso costs a bit more.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much better than Edge.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite shaving products.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s perhaps my favorite feature of this gel.  </li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s one of the better inexpensive off the shelf shaving gels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The disposable GoodNews was interesting.</li>
      <li>Costs more, but you get what you pay for,</li>
      <li>It has many positives.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  </li>
      <li>I like this gel because it doesn&#x27;t foam up and gives a nice smooth shave.</li>
      <li>So many males are used to foam products for shaving - this product is a gel.  </li>
      <li>Tolerable would be a better</li>
      <li>6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5</li>
      <li>Most shave creams I have tried</li>
      <li>The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  </li>
      <li>We will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  </li>
      <li>It shave ok though</li>
      <li>I love it how it feels</li>
      <li>Most gels aren&#x27;t, but Alphagel has a more chemical smell than I am used to.</li>
      <li>Got this for my husband and he thinks that it is just OK</li>
      <li>The shave is just as close as with Alphagel, but with slightly more razor burn.</li>
      <li>Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used manual razors and wet-shave electrics with shaving cream and had always relied on my stand-by - Shave Secret shaving oil topped with a little Edge. This provided a light coating with lubricating oil (very important). Alphagel does it one better by including oil and a gel to provide the best shave in one product. It saves time and requires very little of the gel to get the job done. I really appreciate the low-foaming characteristics to let you see what you&#x27;re shaving and to keep the mess down as well. I passed on trying the cooling menthol version, but I can imagine it soothes more sensitive skin folks.</li>
    <li> This shave gel has a nice, natural (and pretty manly) smell to it. I didn&#x27;t notice that it moisturized very much, I still had to use lotion on my skin to prevent dryness. It&#x27;s pretty standard as shaving gel goes, although because it is low foam, it tends to be difficult to determine where you have shaved. I suppose this is less a problem for men than it is for women (shaving the face vs. shaving legs), but I prefer a shaving gel or crem that foams a bit more.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he thinks that it is just OK but is sticking with his regular shave cream.  First, it can be hard to see where you actually have the gel and where you have shaven where with regular shave cream, or gel that foams, it is easy to see where it is and where you have already shaved.  He also said that it also left a weird tingling feeling after that he didn&#x27;t really like.  Only plus was that it left skin soft without irritation.  Needless to say, we will not be getting this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels GREAT when you use it and leaves your face feeling cool afterwards, too.  My husband got a closer shave with this than the usual gel that we use.  It was kind of odd at first because it feels a little thin when you put it on your fingers and it does take about a minute to get it lathered up well.  So he wasn&#x27;t sure what he&#x27;d think at first but he just loved it.  He liked it so much that I decided to try it on my legs and underarms.  It was GREAT!  I will most definitely be buying this again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only brands I can find like this. I can&#x27;t stand foam and most products of this type are boutique and expensive. Stores don&#x27;t have many of this on hand, so I get it here instead of running around looking for some.</li>
    <li> Originally I got this shaving gel for my husband.  He raved about it so much that I just had to give it a try.  I used it on my legs and it worked beautifully.  My legs came out smooth and soft and I didn&#x27;t smell like a boy because it has a crisp, clean scent.  Highly recommended for both guys and ladies!</li>
    <li> Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel works as advertised.  It lubricates my skin and makes shaving pretty effortless.  I&#x27;d almost compare it favorably to my standard shaving gel [[ASIN:B000052YIE Edge Sensitive Skin Shave Gel for Men]].  I was a bit surprised when I first used the Remington Gel it as it doesn&#x27;t foam up as Edge Gel does, but it works just as well and perhaps makes shaving a bit easier since you not having to deal with foam getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I said \\&quot;almost compare it favorably\\&quot; above because the scent of the Remington Gel is a bit off-putting.  The smell is quite medicinal, and I&#x27;d have to make sure to wash this off my face completely after use as I have no interest in smelling like this product when I&#x27;m done.  In addition, this product is about twice as expensive as Edge Gel, and in it&#x27;s current state this Remington Gel isn&#x27;t worth the cost premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if Remington could work on this product a bit more and tone down the unpleasant scent I might consider making this my go-to shave gel - but as is I would probably pass on this, esp. at the premium price.</li>
    <li> This shave gel is pretty good stuff actually. It seems to really soothe the skin and lessens the occurance or razor burn and irritation in general. The razor glides right through it and allows for a really close shave. It seems like it is easier to rinse the hair and product off of the razor blades when using this Remington gel - the blades aren&#x27;t clogging up as much as when I used a foam or cream. Skin also does not feel dry or tight after shaving. The Aloe probably is helping to hydrate somewhat. Overall it is a great choice for an irritation-free, close shave and for sensitive skin. The price isn&#x27;t bad at all when compared to other products and you do not need to use a ton of product at a time either, so it lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> This is a good shave gel, but nothing extraordinary.  A little bit goes a long way, and makes for a smooth glide with your razor.  You can get a nice, close shave with it.  Another reviewer thought it smelled like Pinesol, but I didn&#x27;t think that at all.  The fragrance is light and pleasant, and really not that noticeable.  I would use this again because it does the job, but there wasn&#x27;t anything about it that made me think, \\&quot;Wow.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an Edge pro-gel user for, oh, 15 years or so, since I had to start shaving. I&#x27;m a daily shaver, for if I don&#x27;t I look like a combination Gandalf the Grey and Brian Wilson from the Giants (not the Beach Boy). It&#x27;s pretty bad, so I keep good track of what works and what doesn&#x27;t in shaving materials. I&#x27;ve tried a number of the expensive shave gels/creams/oils/solutions, and found them lacking at $20 a tube, and certainly not more effective than my cheapo Edge gel.   Pros:  - Provides a very nice, smooth shave  - Didn&#x27;t get any razor burn when using it, just smooth cheeks  - Comes in a good sized container for a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; shaving product. I figure this would last me a month, maybe a bit more.  - Price is reasonable compared to other \\&quot;premium\\&quot; products.  Cons:  - I have a hard time determining where I have adequate gel coverage. Maybe I&#x27;m spoiled by the white puffy face clouds that Edge provides, but this is harder to see.  Overall, a very good product, but the price/performance still can&#x27;t compare with my old mainstay. Edge wins in a landslide.</li>
    <li> As a shaving lubricant, Alphagel works very well. The gel applies easily and is slightly slicker than the typical shave gel, which seems to result in a little less skin abrasion. So, strictly from a functionality standpoint, it&#x27;s as good or better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand... the smell is not pleasant. Most gels aren&#x27;t, but Alphagel has a more chemical smell than I am used to. It&#x27;s not a deal-breaker, but they should definitely look into changing it. My second issue is the size. A tube of Alphagel holds less than a typical can of gel. This serves to mask what is a considerably higher price for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product was cheaper, or smelled better (or better yet, not at all) I would be very likely to buy it. As is, I will most likely pass and continue using other products.</li>
    <li> Most \\&quot;gel\\&quot; shaving creams turn into foam upon application.  So essentially your getting the same product as your father did years ago in a fancier bottle at a high price.  But Remington&#x27;s Alphagel is very different.  It comes out of the tube as a gel and stays a gel.  Once applied it has a nice cooling feel as it readies your stubble for shaving.  The gel stays clear so you can actually see what your shaving.  The gel helps glide the razor for a smooth shave with no irritation afterwards.  I have used this for about a month and shaved with and against the grain and never once nicked myself.  It can be used with Remington&#x27;s Azor 5 blade razor or even your favorite brand.  Either was you will get the smoothest, non-irritating shave.  And if you want to do a little \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; you&#x27;ll have similar results.</li>
    <li> There is an old saying that you get what you pay for, the Remington Alphagel sensitive shave gel certainly proves it.  I am a cheap shaver, I&#x27;ve never bothered with anytime more than a bargain brand but this stuff has certainly spoiled me.  A very small amount sets up my beard for the Razor to nail without worry every time, and my beard is tough.  It&#x27;s a premium product and you pay a premium price, but you also get premium results which is the whole point.  If your budget can handle it, buy it.</li>
    <li> I like the low foaming quality because it leads to less mess while shaving, however, the smell is a little medicinal and may be off putting to some.</li>
    <li> The shave is good and close with this gel but I have to say the smell is a bit off.  I used it myself since I prefer mens shaving lotions but my husband also remarked that the smell was a bit odd as well so it wasn&#x27;t just me being a girl.  However, the gel DOES perform well and as described.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clear, which is what I was looking for, and it works great; however, the smell is horrible.  Can&#x27;t stand it.  Finished using it, but will not buy it again.  I recommend the Gillette Clear Shave gel.  Costs more, but you get what you pay for,</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like shaving with this gel because it was hard to tell (without glasses in the shower) where I had already shaved even though the manufacturer claims, \\&quot;See Where You&#x27;re Shaving.\\&quot; My husband likes it for his sensitive skin...   Though they say it is fragrance free, there is a light, very pleasant mint scent to the gel.   I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unless my husband specifically asked for it.</li>
    <li> Good shave gel, smells nice, makes for a nice clean shave, no ingrown hairs.  I would recommend this shave gel.</li>
    <li> In my younger college days, I could dry shave and not have any issues.  However, as I grew older, the skin on my face has grown more sensitive and I seem to be more prone to razor burn.  Most shave creams I have tried had never really helped that much.  When I had the opportunity to try Remington&#x27;s King of Shaves Alphagel Shave gel, I thought it might be worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I use a Gillette Fusion manual cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the gel, the scent reminded me of a faint Vicks Vapor Rub odor.  Upon looking at the ingredients, there is a unique blends of oils which seem to lend to the scent:  Eucalyptus, Tea Tree/Melaleuca , and Spearmint oils with some Camphor.  The resulting scent is rather unique.  While I would not call the scent unpleasant, it definitely different.  The scent did not seem to linger long after shaving and washing my face, though I am unsure if the scent fades quickly or if I just get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having mixed feeling about the shave gel.  If I shaved right after getting out of the shower where the warm water had a chance to soften my beard, I thought this shave gel is the best there is.  With a softened beard, the shave gel had excellent lubricating properties and I thought the product gave an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I would use the shave gel when my face was dry, I was less than impressed.  Even if I washed my face prior to shaving to give my beard a little extra water to absorb, the shave gel just did not seem to do a good job softening my beard.  When it comes to shaving when your face is dry, I thought my foam shaving cream did a better job than the shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I thought that this was a good product.  In my case, if I used it right after a shower, I thought it gave a superior shave to my traditional foam shave cream.  The scent did seem to be a bit odd to me and I could easily see this being a turn off for some people.  For those who have sensitive skin, I would recommend giving this shave gel a try.</li>
    <li> People can come at shave lubricants from many standpoints.  I&#x27;ll try to address a few here.  Cartridge Shaver:  If you use a regular cartridge like a Schick Quattro, Gillette Fusion/Mach 3 or even Remington&#x27;s own (which I don&#x27;t recommend) then this is a very good gel.  It&#x27;s super slick so you get great glide with little to no pull.  It&#x27;s also cleans up easily so you aren&#x27;t stuck with a goopy mess on your face that you have to try and scrape off after the shave.  All in all, it&#x27;s one of the better inexpensive off the shelf shaving gels I&#x27;ve used. - 4 1/2 stars  Traditional \\&quot;Wet Shaver\\&quot;:  I&#x27;ve you&#x27;re a wet shaver using either straight razors or double edged safety razors I can&#x27;t really recommend this product.  It is very slick as previously mentioned but it was designed for cartridge use.  It doesn&#x27;t really lather and give almost no cushion for more exposed blades.  Even the most experience wet shaver is likely to nick themselves. - 2 stars  Sensitive Skin Shaver:  If you \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin and heavy perfumes irritate your skin then this is a fine product.  If you really have sensitive skin due to numerous chemical allergies then isn&#x27;t going to cut it.  You can go ahead and throw it in with all the other \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products you&#x27;ve already dumped in the trash bin. - 2 stars</li>
    <li> Great product, but the tubes looked 75% full. I am hoping that this is just &amp;#34;settling of product&amp;#34; and not mis-weighed, but I&#x27;ve bought this product before and never noticed this problem.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shaving products.  Just a little needed and doesn&#x27;t clog my razor blades (Especially the [[ASIN:B005ACNPKA Remington King of Shaves Azor Manual Men&#x27;s Razor]]).</li>
    <li> I chose this for myself but my husband also uses it and loves it. We both have sensitive skin and this product gives us close shaves without burns or nicks. It&#x27;s so light and works best in a thin layer. Just be sure to moisten your skin and hair well with warm water first to get the best result. Finally - no more sloppy goopy foam all over the place that never really gave us much protection anyway.</li>
    <li> When I first used this, I did put too much.  Had a hard time shaving because of the foam, then I scraped it off (I know it was a waste) and then shaved and it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my legs and it did leave my skin smooth and silky.  Then I tried a little of it on my pubic  area and the results were great there too.  And because it foams up, remember, just put less than you think you need.  You can always put more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll let my daughter use this, might make her first shaving experience more nick free.</li>
    <li> Another very hard to find product.  Great stuff if you want to reduce/eliminate nicks while shaving since it remains clear and doesn&#x27;t produce any foam.</li>
    <li> Unlike the equally slick Gillette shaving gel, Remington Alphagel cleans up nicely when you are done shaving and protects my face just as nicely.</li>
    <li> I really tried to like this, it seemed like a good idea to able to shave around my sideburns and mustache with greater &#x27;precision&#x27;.  In practice, it turns out I find it easier to see what I have shaved or not with the gel I use that turns into foam.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to make my shave any smoother than what I use either.  One thing I did notice is a really strong perfume smell when applying this product, and it was not a good smell.</li>
    <li> Never having using gel to shave before, my husband was a bit hesitant to try this one out since he is used to the typical \\&quot;in the can\\&quot; types. He was pleasantly surprised to find that it indeed not only works great, but is MUCH more economical in spite of the higher price upfront.  It does not foam up very good, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work.  It works great with a small amount, and this tube will be lasting a VERY long time. Excellent for keeping irritation down and shaving easily and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a woman&#x27;s point of view, the smell is very appealing and I most definitely approve. :D  I wish it was a bit stronger smelling, personally... I loved the smell of the aerosol ones, how it clung to his face after he shaved. This one is not as noticeable unless you get up close (no problems there! LOL) So if you are a typical guy who doesn&#x27;t like all those strong \\&quot;perfumes\\&quot;, then you will love it.  If you want the girls to cling to you, maybe try something else. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t have the can... this is more environmentally friendly. 5 stars all around!</li>
    <li> I must have tried between 30-40 different kinds of shaving cream, soap, sticks,and oils. These have ranged from the cheapest to some of the most expensive (Truefitt&amp;Hill, Trumpers, AOS,TOBS, etc...). After using each for a week at least I assign them to 4 tiers (highest, next to the highest, next to the next to the highest, and lastly &amp;#34;are you kidding?&amp;#34;) based on lathering, glide, lubrication, closeness of shave, irritation, nicking, feel of face after use, scent, ease of use and some subjective elements as well. I then shave half my face with one product and half with another with many variable eliminated for integrity. I concluded after a week&#x27;s use that this product is by far the worst in terms of glide, lubrication, closeness of shave and below the worst for scent. I would characterize the scent as industrial solvent gone bad. Other than its low price I find nothing redeeming here. My favorites? Kiss My face, VanDerHagen Luxury, TOBS for Sensitive Skin,Cella and AOS in that order. That&#x27;s my 3 cents.</li>
    <li> I waited until reaching the very end of the bottle before writing my review, because admittedly, it was an odd transition to use a non-foaming gel in place of traditional foamy shaving lotion.  However, I have been really surprised and pleased with this product. First of all: it lasts WAY longer than traditional lotion.  You don&#x27;t need to use much at all to form a nice thick protective layer on your skin.  It feels somewhat like toothpaste in terms of texture and rinses off fairly easily leaving your skin SUPER MOISTURIZED.  That&#x27;s perhaps my favorite feature of this gel.  Shaving never leaves my skin dry or flaky whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, a great product! Long lasting, no mess and great for my skin! Recommended A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this with a Schick Quattro, Gilette Fusion, and Gilette GoodNews. The Quattro and Fusion gums up pretty bad. I think its because the spacing between the blades is narrow. Once it gunks up, the blade doesn&#x27;t shave reliably. It&#x27;s stickier than shaving cream, and not as water-soluble, so you cannot just run it under hot water. You have to tap it on sing repeatedly to get it clean. I once tapped the Fusion so hard, the moisturizing strip fell off. This product is hard on the reusable blades, so expect less life out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the shaves are great! Smooth clean passes with almost no razor burn. Skin isn&#x27;t dry. In fact, the shave gel works so well, I don&#x27;t even need aftershave. The disposable GoodNews was interesting. I hate these. They always leave my skin ashy and burns for hours. But I had a bunch of them lying around and I wanted to test my theory about the blade spacing. It doesn&#x27;t cake with gel as much and taps out pretty easily. The shave was clean, took fewer passes, and there was considerably less dry skin and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still a residual stickiness after the shave, which is a bit uncomfortable. Hot water and a good towel will wash it away. You need to rinse a lot if you&#x27;re using just water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on clear and stays clear, unlike other gels that lather on contact.&lt;br /&gt;- Blades glide over skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced razor burn. Almost none with a good blade.&lt;br /&gt;- Skin is smooth &amp; hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Gel leaves a sticky feeling and does not rinse away easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;- Gums up between blades and does not rinse away easily. Must tap frequently to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I&#x27;d say this is a pretty fantastic shave gel. But it&#x27;s only marginally better than Lubriderm. Yes, the moisturizing lotion. I apply it thickly. It&#x27;s not as sticky so it doesn&#x27;t clog up the blades. It taps out much easier. The shave is just as close as with Alphagel, but with slightly more razor burn. A little aftershave cools it right down. And of course it moisturizes the skin, its Lubriderm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: This product gives you an excellent close shave with minimal razor burn, but it puts more wear and tear on the razor. And Lubriderm is 99% as good, is cheaper than Alphagel, and is easier on the razor. But Alphagel is very good, so still deserves all 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Why this is not the number one shaving cream in the US is a mystery to me. Nothing works better, prevents nicks better, rinses better...I could go on. Let&#x27;s just say I have trouble finding it in stores now for some reason so when I buy it on Amazon, I buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the better shaving gel. It does help me get a closer shave with my safety razor but nothing beats Proraso Shaving Creams and gels. But then again you get what you pay for, for the price, i would say it is the best. The Proraso costs a bit more. I bought this once and it was good while it lasted but now i switched to Proraso.</li>
    <li> Never had a smoother shave!  Ever!  Better than any shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  And I usually hate shaving!  Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Outstanding shave gel -- it moisturizes and allows for a smooth and close shave.  Look around a bit to get a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is da bomb! Can&#x27;t shave without it! I highly recommend it, especially if you shave your head. AAA+++</li>
    <li> IT IS THE BEST , IF YOU TRY IT YOU WILL NEVER BY ANYTHING ELSE. VERY BEST SHAVE MONEY CAN BY.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving gel. I can&#x27;t find it in stores in my city. &amp;#34;Kind of Shaves&amp;#34; disappeared and reappeared with Remington branding, then disappeared again. I&#x27;m writing a review in hope that retailers will start stocking it again, or the manufacturer will keep producing it. My husband uses it on his face. I use it ... everywhere that ladies do shaving.</li>
    <li> This cream saved my life. This is a good brand as well and you would be happy to have it in your arsenal.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaving gel. He used to get this brand at Target -- but when he kept trying to replenish his supply, the shelves were always empty. According to my husband this product may be a little spendy, but it is worth it. He says it is a quality product that is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff.  It&#x27;s the perfect shaving medium for my face. Cheap enough you can&#x27;t go wrong trying it at least once.  Personally I&#x27;d avoid the menthol stuff, but that&#x27;s just me - I&#x27;m not a fan of mint-face.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving regiments over my short life span. From depilatory&#x27;s to shaving foams, creams, sticks, you name it. For every day shaves however, this takes the gambit. I&#x27;ve been using King of Shaves every couple days for about a year. I like Speick shaving stick for the smell (used mostly for dates and interviews), but it is not nearly as slick as this stuff. I like the cool gel look, and the fact that it does not get over foamy (meaning you can actually see where you&#x27;re shaving). The smell is good (methanol), but sometimes I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. Absolutely love this product. I would and have definitely recommended this product. I use it with a DE razor (feather blades) and a shaving brush, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> For Christmas I received a Braun Series 7 799CC-AWD shaver.  This electric shaver is designed for use in the shower.  After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  Please note that using shaving cream with an electric shaver is different than using shaving cream with a blade.  You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  Some are even oils instead of creams.  I spent some time researching which shaving creams and gels to try and settled on the following.  I tried them all out for several months.  Here are my findings based on shaving with my electric shaver with my skin.  You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold for Men:  http://www.amazon.com/Bold-For-Men-Dry-Shave/dp/B000OZZH18/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390669335&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;bold+for+men+shave+gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  4 min. 58 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  1 out of 5  (very raw, 3 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  Dead last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving gel is described as a dry shaving gel.  I used it in the shower on my damp face without any water.  I don&#x27;t think this impeded its usage at all.  I selected it to test because of the favorable reviews for using it, including reviewers who used it in the shower.  While this smelled a little better than the Alphagel, I thought this gel produced worse results.  My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really rawafter shaving.  After I was done shaving and I washed the gel off of my face, I found it made my face feel really hot.  This is not a good thing.  The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  I did like how this gel didn&#x27;t foam at all.  You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  It was also a little faster shaving with this than the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Shaves-Alphagel-Sensitive-Shave/dp/B005ACNPLO/ref&#x3D;sr_1_15?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390068105&amp;sr&#x3D;8-15&amp;keywords&#x3D;alpha+gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  4 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found this shaving gel to have the worst smell of any that I tried.  It smells like those pucks you find in dirty highway gas station urinals.  My wife thought my face didn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards, but when I had her smell the gel from the tube, she said, &amp;#34;Oh my god, that is awful!&amp;#34;.  The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  After shaving with it for a week my skin became irritated and started to bleed in a couple of places.  Lubrication was poor during shaving too.  It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  I had a lot of trouble getting it to shave closely, which is why it took so long to shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eshu Shave Gel:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SOMEG2/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  3 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  2 out of 5  (raw, 2 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  4th Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a noticeable improvement between the last shaving gel and this one.  Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  It does have an odor that I don&#x27;t care for but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as bad as the Alphagel.  It comes out as an oil but does foam up as you shave with it.  The foaminess isn&#x27;t so excessive that I would discourage people from not using it with an electric razor.  Overall, not a bad shave, but I did notice that by the end of the week my face was feeling raw and I definitely needed a day or two for it to recover before shaving again.  One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull Dog Original Shave Gel:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IX45FQ/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  7 min. 22 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  2 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  3rd Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  This was both good and bad.  It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  No nicks all week.  The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  Tolerable would be a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  6 min. 48 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  1 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  It has many positives.  You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  There are a few negatives however.  It had was the foamiest of any of the gels I tried.  It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  I would have preferred that it didn&#x27;t have a scent at all or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  At least it didn&#x27;t smell like a dingy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, Fragrance Free:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DU1Q4W/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  4 min. 12 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  1st Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  It comes out of the tube as a cream consistency.  It may have been the thickest of the gels, but wasn&#x27;t so thick to create a problem.  This is probably why it lubricated my face so well and left it feeling less irritation.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  The smell was the least objectionable of any of the six that I tried.  While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  While shaving I didn&#x27;t notice an odor.  This gel also was the fastest to shave with and also gave me the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had tried all of these for several months I also tried the Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Cool Mint.  It has a mint scent to it.  I didn&#x27;t notice any cooling effect and after shaving and getting dressed, my wife didn&#x27;t notice any mint smell at all.</li>
    <li> I used to use an electric razor because &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razors always cut me &amp; I have  a tough beard.  Here you can see what you&#x27;re shaving (because it doesn&#x27;t foam up) &amp; you only need a small amount.  I shave every 2-3 days (yeah, I&#x27;m retired) &amp; 3 tubes lasted me a year.</li>
    <li> I discovered this on a trip to Great Britain and have been using it ever since (about 10 years.)  It&#x27;s a low-foam gel that gives me a close shave without a nick or razor burn.  The biggest problem is availability.  Used to be sold in places like Walgreens, Target, and even some of the Kroger family of stores.  In my opinion, if they advertised and promoted it, I wouldn&#x27;t be one of the last 5 people in the US still using it.  I hope it will still be available on Amazon for many more years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using KOS for years.  Its nice to purchase it this way.  Service was virtually the next day.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> this goes on thick, smooth and clear! you can get lather if you want to rub or brush it up, but it&#x27;s much more helpful to me to see where I&#x27;m cutting and it stays moist until you get the other half of your face shaved. It leaves your face smooth and moistened afterwards ... very few if any nicks or cuts: a great shave. I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s a good thing they were bought by Remington. Big guys can&#x27;t let a good thing be without some gung-ho executive-type changing something because they have to make the rest of the world over in their own image. The King of Shaves was just fine without some giants&#x27; horizontal aspirations. Hint: Don&#x27;t change it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for menthol OR mint in my shower or shave gel . I&#x27;m truly sorry some guys get what must be an awful burn just shaving occasionally. This might help. I got the menthol version by mistake once and tried to use it. Way Too Intense! it hurt my face it was too &#x27;cold&#x27;; but that may be what you want.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m a bit of a shaving geek.  My method of choice is a hot shower followed by pre-shave oil and Art of Shaving cream on a badger brush.  I shave with a Merkur safety razor using the two pass system.  For my money, nothing beats the shave I get following that method.  HOWEVER, when I&#x27;m running late or in a hurry, I&#x27;ll resort to something a little quicker, usually Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shave cream.  The King of Shaves Alphagel falls a little short of the Billy Jealousy for the quality of shave, but it is superior for the condition in which it leaves my skin after shaving.  I do get a reasonably close shave with this product and my skin does feel good after using it, but not good enough to forgo an aftershave gel.  This product is considerably less pricey than the Billy Jealousy and I&#x27;ll probably buy it when I&#x27;m out of the other AS A BACKUP, or for traveling.  It&#x27;s a good product for what it is.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband, but I quickly stole it for my shower to shave my legs with.  It leaves no residue, makes the blade slide super close over your legs, and is unscented.  The one thing to be a bit cautious of is that it does make your tub floor a bit slick while you are using it.  As long as you are aware of this it is fine and you won&#x27;t have a problem but be a little careful the first time so you don&#x27;t fall.  This slickness though is what makes it so great for shaving so it is perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a shaving gel dispensed in a tube.  It contains aloe, which may be soothing for some people with sensitive skin.  Other ingredients include sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, Mentha viridis (spearmint) leaf oil, Cinnamonum camphora.  The gel is slightly blue when it&#x27;s in the tube and doesn&#x27;t produce a foam when you work it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature of this product is the tube--it&#x27;s much more environmentally friendly than a can of shaving cream.  It&#x27;s also less messy to use and easier to travel with.  Between the Eucalyptus, tea tree, spearmint and cinnamon ingredients, the gel has a very strong scent, which my husband finds rather overpowering.  Tea tree oil is a good ingredient to add to shaving cream, though, since it is such a powerful remedy for skin ailments and injuries.  But the inclusion of triethanolamine is not welcome, since it is suspected to cause immunotoxicity, respiratory toxicity, and skin toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shaving cream, my husband found it less than ideal.  A shaving cream needs to do 2 things: 1) soften the whiskers and 2) lubricate the skin.  You need water to soften the whiskers and oil to lubricate the skin.  And of course, water and oil don&#x27;t mix, so you need a wetting agent or surfactant to put them together.  My husband found that this shaving cream tends to be on the oily side and doesn&#x27;t soften the whiskers enough.  He prefers The Real Shaving Company&#x27;s Shave Cream for its balance of water and oil and low scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome because it is transparent so you can see where you have and have not already shaved.  Moreover, it&#x27;s really good at lubricating the skin to prevent razor burn, and it leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  Your special lady will definitely want to be makey outey after you shave with this.</li>
    <li> For anyone who has not tried it this stuff is fantastic. I&#x27;ve converted many friends to this who had been using other stuff for 30 years. Its a great price and you don&#x27;t need much so it lasts a long time. Can&#x27;t find this in store near me anymore so this is where i&#x27;ll be buying.</li>
    <li> I selected this product because it could be reviewed by the males AND females in the household.  How this product fared in our household; The elder male liked the product, as it had a nice glide.  So many males are used to foam products for shaving - this product is a gel.  He liked the glide assisted by the gel, as well as the feel of his face after his shave.  His one negative comment was the strong eucalyptus scent while shaving - the strong scent did not remain on his face.  The younger adult male was not fond of the scent or the non-foam capabilities.  He did not like the feel of his face/head after use.  He went back to a foaming product.  I, the elder female, liked the glide of this product on my legs - but the eucalyptus was very strong.  The product does what it is intended for - but due to the scent and cost, or family will pass on purchasing this product.  I gave it a 4 star as the product is quality - but not a product we would purchase for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Works great with my Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver. Doesn&#x27;t clog the shaver and it&#x27;s nearly transparent even after it&#x27;s applied, so I can easily see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since before Remington bought the company. I was afraid that Remington might tinker with it, but so far it seems to be the same. I use a blade for shaving and prior to this product I assumed that cutting yourself was part of everyday shaving. Not so anymore, any cuts I get now are my own carelessness or due to an old blade. Plus I like the smell. :)</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shave gels but this one is great. It goes on clear, so you can see exactly where to shave and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and I have no complaints. It definitely smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real person, Leo, NY</li>
    <li> It was the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had using this gel. I just wish I could pick up at my local grocery.</li>
    <li> Remington will no longer be distributing King of Shaves in the US and Alpha Gel will be unavailable while this UK company works on new distribution here in the states.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive face and I&#x27;ve tried lots of gels, but this one is the best.  It works perfectly with electric shavers in the shower (Norelco) and soothes the skin well.  I won&#x27;t use anything else...</li>
    <li> I found the first tube in a clearance table at a local grocery store and have been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only shave gel that gives me a close shave and rinses completely off of my razor, allowing&lt;br /&gt;me to save money on blades, also I have sensitive skin and that feature is a comfort.</li>
    <li> Wehtehr this gel serves the purpose, I am not sure. But putting it on my face and not feeling any pleasant aroma, didi not please me.  Perhaps I am pampered, but I prefer a pleasant gel that becomes foam.</li>
    <li> Having used this product for the past month, I feel confident recommending it. It is a really nice shave gel, especially for men with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product for three reasons. First, it provides a strong coating of protection to prevent the blade from scraping my bare skin. Second, it produces a light--but not too intense--cooling sensation (the green version may be more intense, if you&#x27;re into that). Third, it is clear, which allows me to shave with greater safety and precision than do its opaque competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, please note that this is not the be-all-end-all to shaving plight. I still get little nicks, bumps, and rashes, particularly on my lower neck area. This is the case even though I use this shaving gel, prep my face with warm water and soap, and use super sharp Feather double-edge safety razors with a light and steady hand. It may well be impossible to conquer the sensitivity of my lower neck. But, I do think that this product is a step in the right direction.</li>
    <li> i am not sure how many people actually uses gel but I am do and I have to.&lt;br /&gt;the gel is not very thick and fluid enough to roll on to your skin and soften the roots. applying the right amount is the key and you get to find your solution after couple of days of use.&lt;br /&gt;provides a very soothing and gentle shave. if you are one of those people who are have lots cuts or a newbie to shaving then this is good for you, because the gel is almost clear so you can see what you are shaving unlike foam.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers one of the sensitive skin aerosols to this gel.  Can&#x27;t say why definitively.  Think it&#x27;s part familiarity.</li>
    <li> This the best thing out there.  It works great for women who shave; it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  So now I purchase this for me - as well as my hubby. I recommend it for any hair texture and skin types.  It has a masculine scent, but it&#x27;s eaily washed away with soap.</li>
    <li> I saw this on clearance at a local supermarket. For decades, Remington hasn&#x27;t been well-regarded in my family, but I thought I&#x27;d try this for a few bucks. It gives a pretty darn smooth shave! It&#x27;s about as good as any other gel/foam I&#x27;ve tried, though I can&#x27;t say if the extra aloe makes any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to get over the smell, though. I have to shave before I shower, to wash it all off. Otherwise my wife avoids me for smelling like industrial chemicals.</li>
    <li> Got this as a free sample for my husband to try.  The timing was good because he had just run out of his usual shaving gel and I decided he needed something new.  Never again will I try to get him a new product for shaving.  Anything that could be wrong with a product like this was.  First, the smell was awful.  I couldn&#x27;t stand to be close to him so I cant imagine how he felt.  Next, there were more nicks on his face and neck than any 20 shavings combined I have seen from him before.  I mean, he bled a lot.  Lastly, he had the worst case of razor burn I have ever seen on him.  His neck was so red and sensitive, that I couldn&#x27;t get near even if I could stand the smell.  Being the nice guy he is, he tried it a couple of more times just to make sure that he wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong as well as to give the product a chance to do what it is touted to do.  In the end, he threw it away and told me to stick with the old product.</li>
    <li> best shaving product I have used, works very, very well</li>
    <li> Works well but I just can&#x27;t get beyond the smell.  Switched to Nivea which works as well but has a neutral scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since my husband used an old fashioned wet shaver so this Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel has been sitting in the bathroom for a while. He finally got to use it over the past couple of months and here is what he found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shave gel doesn&#x27;t foam like some of the others and stays in gel form when you apply it. First thing he noticed was how cool it felt on his skin.  He says that it&#x27;s a bit like the feeling you get when you put on the skin nourishing shampoos; it&#x27;s a nice, refreshing feeling, especially during the hot summer months.  The gel is not too oily or greasy but does have to be rehydrated with water if you aren&#x27;t quick about shaving. So long as you use water it stays slick and is quite easy to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, he still prefers his old Neutrogena shaving gel because he says that although it doesn&#x27;t feel as nice, it allows the blade to glide over his skin better.  But the Remington is quite good and, for the price, might be a good alternative cream.</li>
    <li> I bought a tube when I was in New Zealand last year and right away I was afraid of the day I ran out. I like this gel because it doesn&#x27;t foam up and gives a nice smooth shave. I could buy some through their website but three tubes would come out to be about $10 each after shipping.  I should just buy a couple cases and sell them on ebay.</li>
    <li> You used to be able to find it easily at Target and other stores, but apparently a cross up between the manufacturer and the distributor has made it hard to get in the states.  You get a really nice, smooth shave.  It&#x27;s not foamy - it stays as pretty much a gel on your face, rinses clean from your razor, and doesn&#x27;t have any heavy scent.</li>
    <li> This, by far is the best shaving gel. I have tried other gels twice the price and not as good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.  I&#x27;m old and ugly, but rubbing a dollup of it under each eye definitely gets rid of the wrinkles.  And the shaving is really smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It is great when combined with a fresh blade Schick Quatro (which last a long time).  My skin is super sensitive and my beard is hard to shave.  This combination gives me the most comfort by far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and haven&#x27;t found anything yet that matches the skin-protecting ability of this gel.  There may be other fancier-looking packages out there, but when it comes to performance, King of Shaves has them beat.</li>
    <li> My husband has a very difficult beard.  He found this product and he is very happy with it.  We will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Edge shaving cream for a couple decades, especially their peppermint shave cream (which they discontinued a few years ago). It was brought back recently, but it&#x27;s not as good and is extremely hard to find. So I tried this is it&#x27;s much better than Edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...I&#x27;ll switch to a different brand for the first time in decades.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and its variations for several years.  Each tube last about as long as a can of shave cream, but is more lubricating and less irritating on skin.  Don&#x27;t find this in stores very much these days, but if you can find on Amazon of $5-6, you&#x27;re doing pretty well.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> The best a Man can get</li>
    <li> Has been a nice switch away from gels in aerosol cans.  Same or better shave, more compact, easy to tell when you&#x27;re running low (as opposed to the canned shave cremes/gels), and great for use in refillable travel bottles to keep your liquids to a minimum to fit into the FAA-mandated 1 quart travel pouches.</li>
    <li> I have pretty much tried every single type of shaving cream/gel on the market. I have a very sensitive neck and the Alphagel Sensitive is the ONLY product that I can shave with and not cut up my neck. It is hands down the best shaving gel on the market and I was disappointed that it was no longer being sold in Target. I&#x27;ve been buying this for years and I freaked out when they no longer carried it.  It looks like Remington and Kind of Shaves had a falling out and Remington is no longer carrying the product in the U.S. and according to the King of Shaves website at [...]- Will King, Founder and CEO- \\&quot;For reasons that I am unable to express publicly, this partnership was dissolved in spring of 2012 and from January 1st 2013 it&#x27;ll be King of Shaves riding solo again, doing things in our own way.    This means for much of 2013 there will be a hiatus of supply regarding King of Shaves as we strategically decide how to position our successful brand in the USA. It&#x27;s never been easy for us in the USA - I&#x27;m not too sure why - as we have had an amazing following, but somehow never &#x60;quite&#x27; broken through (hence us signing with Remington to see if that would help us make it work).\\&quot;    Anyway, I purchased a year&#x27;s supply of this. The tubes seem to last me at least a month or so.    I will never use anything else for shaving!</li>
    <li> I would get it it regularly but its expensive.  I love it how it feels and it protects my face from razor burns.  I use it when I want to treat myself.</li>
    <li> Glillet must have messed with this formula as well. The Tea Tree aroma is at best vague. It shave ok though</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this product &amp; recommends it to any fiends with a coarse, full beard. Not too fragrant.  Leaves skin very smooth &amp; soft. And I recommend for leg shaving too as I prefer gel over cream.</li>
