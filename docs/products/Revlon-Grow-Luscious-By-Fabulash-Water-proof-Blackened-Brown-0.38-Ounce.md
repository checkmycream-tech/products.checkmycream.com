      <li>I used to use Covergirl LashBlast which I really liked</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice in-between.      </li>
      <li>After it dries it takes on a kind of gummy texture and crumbles onto your face and into your eyes, and also smudges under the eyes.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve used by them.</li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>I love layering this mascara.</li>
      <li>The reason I can&#x27;t love this and why I won&#x27;t buy this again is because this is supposed to be a waterproof mascara, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>Love the idea it helps my lashes grow.  </li>
      <li>Almost immediatly it came off the top lashes and formed a halo under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Lovely.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and you have nice full  eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I only use waterproof and this kind is very nice.</li>
      <li>it gives volume, it makes my lashes longer and when I have introduced girlfriends to it, they have been just as excited as me :)</li>
      <li>Hands down this mascara is the best OTC that I have ever bought</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a few months and it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this mascara, but it has too many drawbacks to do so.  </li>
      <li>On my lashes they are long and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>I bought at Walmart and have liked other Revelon mascaras with good results.</li>
      <li>First off, the brush - its HUGE!</li>
      <li>I have noticed a significant difference in the length of my lashes since I started using it.</li>
      <li>I would give it five stars, but I haven&#x27;t yet found a make-up remover that is good at getting this stuff back off.</li>
      <li>First of all, as others have stated before, the wand is HUGE.  </li>
      <li>I like that my lashes look more natural than overdone.  </li>
      <li>Finally, and probably most importantly, after it dries on your lashes it crumbles off from the slightest touch</li>
      <li>Even if it DOES smudge around my eyes--overnight or during application--it wipes off my skin easily with a dry tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with curling my top lashes, this mascara DOES seem to have made my eyelashes grow.  </li>
      <li>The color is right on to description</li>
      <li>I really wanted to give it a full run of 30 days to see if it would help my lashes grow longer, but it has been 5 days</li>
      <li>It goes on kind of clumpy, possibly because the brush is so over sized -- and I have somewhat large eyes.  </li>
      <li>I know that as a cosmetic item, everyone will have vastly different experiences with a product, but I LOVE this mascara.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s waterproof, so I wear it as a first coat</li>
      <li>Lashes feel soft and naturally light even tho</li>
      <li>Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
      <li>I am not in humid weather or hot.</li>
      <li>I really really like this mascara!</li>
      <li>On the plus side, due to the large amount of bristles, you get nice even coverage with every swipe.      </li>
      <li>Any recommendations from fellow reviewers would be greatly appreciated.</li>
      <li>Revlon must be absolutely nuts to advertise this as waterproof because it isn&#x27;t AT ALL.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I really like a washable one if I can find one that doesn&#x27;t smudge over the course of the day.  </li>
      <li>First of all, the monster application wand is unnecessarily huge making it hard to get where you want it and too easy to get where you don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>This mascara really has conditioned my lashes and made them grow more than any other mascara.</li>
      <li>After trying several other more expensive brands, for me this one is the best.</li>
      <li>Everyone has different physical chemistries, so maybe it will work better for others.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara and the only time I have problems wearing it begins to irritate my eyes if I wear the same bottle longer than a month.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>There is a nice amount of lash separation due to the enormous amount of bristle coverage.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only ever applied mascara to my top lashes, and I&#x27;ve never experienced the raccoon eyes that many commenters are complaining about--unless I don&#x27;t take it off at night before I sleep, but I sleep on my face, so that makes sense.  </li>
      <li>If they haven&#x27;t actually grown, it certainly makes them appear that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is quite big, but I actually find that it works a lot better that way.  </li>
      <li>I live this mascara -</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t have full or lush or long lashes - it will never work for you!</li>
      <li>The mascara does melt onto my top eyelids as well, but it isn&#x27;t too bad because my top lashes just don&#x27;t touch my skin as much.  </li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
      <li>It is enough, though, that I have to constantly check a mirror to clean my eyes up.    </li>
      <li>I usually wear a different waterproof mascara, but liked the idea of the lash protection to help growth.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump on my eyelashes when I apply it, and my lashes remain soft and flexible even after it&#x27;s dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>2nd, even using a normal brush from another mascara - after 2 months use, I see no difference in my lashes.</li>
      <li>I barely have eyelashes but this product makes my eyes pop</li>
      <li>Bought this mascara Two days ago, used it this morning, stayed on pretty well, a bit clumpy after i applied it, the brush is a bit too big and can cause you to smudge your eyelids, if you&#x27;re not too careful.</li>

<li> and I don&#x27;t have this problem as long as I get a new bottle after a month and throw the other bottle away.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t really have too much of an issue with it, but it does make it a little hard to apply to the corner lashes.  </li>
<li> I like a &amp;#34;plush&amp;#34; type brush and am looking for a long lasting mascara.  </li>
<li> My lashes are noticeably fuller now without wearing mascara (it&#x27;s like dark magic) and it really is a dramatic difference.</li>
<li> I already have long lashes but Revlon Grow Luscious By Fabulash</li>
<li> Go to your local walmart &amp; get the regular black version of this mascara.</li>
<li> I actually didn&#x27;t wear any other make-up.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel that it gives me a whole lot of length, but it does offer a subtle fullness that I like.  </li>
<li> My lashes look a lot fuller, not sure about longer, as I naturally have long lashes.</li>
<li> and I actually sweat a little.  </li>
<li> Too bad, I love my other revlon products.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t condition at all and is like every other mascara out there.</li>
<li> None of my other make up changed.</li>
<li> I bought this mascara the other day because I had a $1 off coupon.  </li>
<li> No thanks!</li>
<li> and it is really waterproof, even after rubbing my eyes when they tear because I have very dry eyes that start to tear in random situations</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I certainly can&#x27;t love it.  </li>
<li> Found it can smear a little after all day wear even tho</li>
<li> Goes on very thinly, so I needed 4 layers to really see my lashes vs my usual 2.</li>
<li> but it actually dried out my lashes, making them shorter and thinner.</li>
<li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes clump up and look terrible.  </li>
<li> Not sure how that works</li>
<li> --It is bad enough to make me look like a sleep deprived person with bags under my eyes.  </li>
<li> I hate it because it smudges during the day and if you get any water near your eye . . .</li>
<li> Personally, though, I was just terribly disappointed.  </li>
<li> Dry and flakes. :(</li>
<li> and I can&#x27;t stick it out any longer due to the raccoon issues.  :(</li>
<li> Its supposed to help grow your lashes, but its impossible to get close to the base of your lashes - unless you have eyes as big as a cyclops!</li>
<li> This one was weird.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this mascara the other day because I had a $1 off coupon.  Hands down this mascara is the best OTC that I have ever bought and I am 49. The would say the product and brush compares to the Estee Lauder Mascara.  On my lashes they are long and beautiful.  What a wonderful surprise.</li>
    <li> I usually wear a different waterproof mascara, but liked the idea of the lash protection to help growth. Goes on very thinly, so I needed 4 layers to really see my lashes vs my usual 2. I was wiping mascara off from around my eyes all day and when I hit the pool at PT, I was horrified to see it all over my face when I got out. Bringing it back. Too bad, I love my other revlon products.</li>
    <li> First off, the brush - its HUGE! if you don&#x27;t have full or lush or long lashes - it will never work for you! Its supposed to help grow your lashes, but its impossible to get close to the base of your lashes - unless you have eyes as big as a cyclops! 2nd, even using a normal brush from another mascara - after 2 months use, I see no difference in my lashes. Also, this flakes horribly! Must have been invented by a guy! don&#x27;t bother, save your money!</li>
    <li> Bought this mascara Two days ago, used it this morning, stayed on pretty well, a bit clumpy after i applied it, the brush is a bit too big and can cause you to smudge your eyelids, if you&#x27;re not too careful.</li>
    <li> Where do I begin?  First of all, the monster application wand is unnecessarily huge making it hard to get where you want it and too easy to get where you don&#x27;t.  Secondly, It does NOT make your eyelashes grow in any way.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve not noticed any change in length.  Finally, and probably most importantly, after it dries on your lashes it crumbles off from the slightest touch AND it is NOT waterproof.     DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> Revlon must be absolutely nuts to advertise this as waterproof because it isn&#x27;t AT ALL.  I hate it because it smudges during the day and if you get any water near your eye . . . cry, sweat, pool, shower, it simply melts on your face.</li>
    <li> Bought it just yesterday, used it today.  I already have long lashes but Revlon Grow Luscious By Fabulash, Waterproof gave me the look of longer and fuller lashes.  The formula could use some improvement to reduce flaking.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this mascara, but it has too many drawbacks to do so.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but I certainly can&#x27;t love it.  I will try to be as objective as possible and give both positives and negatives.    First of all, as others have stated before, the wand is HUGE.  I don&#x27;t really have too much of an issue with it, but it does make it a little hard to apply to the corner lashes.  On the plus side, due to the large amount of bristles, you get nice even coverage with every swipe.      The formula isn&#x27;t too \\&quot;wet,\\&quot; but it isn&#x27;t terribly \\&quot;dry\\&quot; either.  It&#x27;s a really nice in-between.      I like that my lashes look more natural than overdone.  I don&#x27;t feel that it gives me a whole lot of length, but it does offer a subtle fullness that I like.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes clump up and look terrible.  There is a nice amount of lash separation due to the enormous amount of bristle coverage.  It doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes, so I do have to curl them separately...I don&#x27;t find to be a big deal, but others might.    The reason I can&#x27;t love this and why I won&#x27;t buy this again is because this is supposed to be a waterproof mascara, but it isn&#x27;t.  It gives me hideous raccoon eyes.  I can&#x27;t apply it to my lower lashes at all because it melts onto my face after just an hour of use--It is bad enough to make me look like a sleep deprived person with bags under my eyes.  It is winter and has been between 20-40 degrees F...I can&#x27;t even fathom what this would be like during the summer months when the temp goes up to between 90-100 degrees and I actually sweat a little.  The mascara does melt onto my top eyelids as well, but it isn&#x27;t too bad because my top lashes just don&#x27;t touch my skin as much.  It is enough, though, that I have to constantly check a mirror to clean my eyes up.    Everyone has different physical chemistries, so maybe it will work better for others.  Personally, though, I was just terribly disappointed.  I really wanted to give it a full run of 30 days to see if it would help my lashes grow longer, but it has been 5 days and I can&#x27;t stick it out any longer due to the raccoon issues.  :(</li>
    <li> I know that as a cosmetic item, everyone will have vastly different experiences with a product, but I LOVE this mascara.  I&#x27;ve only ever applied mascara to my top lashes, and I&#x27;ve never experienced the raccoon eyes that many commenters are complaining about--unless I don&#x27;t take it off at night before I sleep, but I sleep on my face, so that makes sense.  Even if it DOES smudge around my eyes--overnight or during application--it wipes off my skin easily with a dry tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with curling my top lashes, this mascara DOES seem to have made my eyelashes grow.  If they haven&#x27;t actually grown, it certainly makes them appear that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is quite big, but I actually find that it works a lot better that way.  It doesn&#x27;t clump on my eyelashes when I apply it, and my lashes remain soft and flexible even after it&#x27;s dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I don&#x27;t plan to stop purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I bought at Walmart and have liked other Revelon mascaras with good results. This one was weird. I have never had this with mascara before. Almost immediatly it came off the top lashes and formed a halo under my eyes. After my 15 min I had raccoon eyes. It just melts off. I am not in humid weather or hot. Days about 55-60 degrees with no humidity. None of my other make up changed. The third day I tried it I actually didn&#x27;t wear any other make-up. Still had racoon eyes. They come back during the day so I have to completly wash it off.</li>
    <li> Package was torn open and then duck taped together?? No thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a few months and it works wonderfully. My lashes are noticeably fuller now without wearing mascara (it&#x27;s like dark magic) and it really is a dramatic difference. This mascara works wonderfully and never clumps or anything like that--the only mascara I trust is made by Revlon/Almay. This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve used by them. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Lovely. Three applications and you have nice full  eyelashes.  I always repurchase this. Love love love.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and the only time I have problems wearing it begins to irritate my eyes if I wear the same bottle longer than a month.  This may be because I have eye allergies and I don&#x27;t have this problem as long as I get a new bottle after a month and throw the other bottle away.</li>
    <li> This mascara is clumpy, crumbly, and for lack of another word, gummy.  I bought waterproof hoping to avoid raccoon eyes.  No luck here.  It goes on kind of clumpy, possibly because the brush is so over sized -- and I have somewhat large eyes.  After it dries it takes on a kind of gummy texture and crumbles onto your face and into your eyes, and also smudges under the eyes.  I have tried changing my cleansing routine, powdering my eyelashes, not powdering my eyelashes, but all for naught.  I think this is just a bad product.  I like a &amp;#34;plush&amp;#34; type brush and am looking for a long lasting mascara.  I really like a washable one if I can find one that doesn&#x27;t smudge over the course of the day.  Any recommendations from fellow reviewers would be greatly appreciated.</li>
    <li> When my regular waterproof mascara was discontinued I went thru about a dozen diff mascaras before finding this. I love it. I barely have eyelashes but this product makes my eyes pop and it doesn&#x27;t take an act of GOD to remove it! Just soap and water. Love it!</li>
    <li> Has tendency to clump.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I use now. Love this stuff! I only use waterproof and this kind is very nice. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Used it once and never again. Dry and flakes. :(</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!!! I&#x27;ve used Grow Luscious for almost 4 years now. I have noticed a significant difference in the length of my lashes since I started using it. I used to use Covergirl LashBlast which I really liked but it actually dried out my lashes, making them shorter and thinner. This mascara really has conditioned my lashes and made them grow more than any other mascara. I love layering this mascara. Oh but I hate the waterproof version. It doesn&#x27;t condition at all and is like every other mascara out there. Go to your local walmart &amp; get the regular black version of this mascara.</li>
    <li> I really really like this mascara! After trying several other more expensive brands, for me this one is the best. My lashes look a lot fuller, not sure about longer, as I naturally have long lashes. Lashes feel soft and naturally light even tho it&#x27;s a waterproof mascara and it is really waterproof, even after rubbing my eyes when they tear because I have very dry eyes that start to tear in random situations this waterproof mascara does it&#x27;s job without leaving me looking like a racoon. I would definately recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great coverage.  My lashes are growing and getting fuller.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars, but I haven&#x27;t yet found a make-up remover that is good at getting this stuff back off.</li>
    <li> Says waterproof, it is NOT waterproof</li>
    <li> I like how it make my eyes pop. It give my lashes a beautiful curve plus they look HUGE!</li>
    <li> I actually like this mascara. I use it as my daily - but I apply about 50 coats to get a falsie type look. It&#x27;s one of the best mascaras i&#x27;ve tried to get that look. It just takes lots of layers. I never have a problem with flaking either.</li>
    <li> I live this mascara - it gives volume, it makes my lashes longer and when I have introduced girlfriends to it, they have been just as excited as me :)</li>
    <li> Service was great but the product is dumb--debris all over your face!</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
    <li> Competitive price and good product.  Love the idea it helps my lashes grow.  Not sure how that works but that&#x27;s not a criticism of the product.  Found it can smear a little after all day wear even tho it&#x27;s waterproof, so I wear it as a first coat and then second coat w/ another brand waterproof mascara.  I use two coats anyway so it&#x27;s no big deal for me.  The color is right on to description and I would purchase this again.</li>
