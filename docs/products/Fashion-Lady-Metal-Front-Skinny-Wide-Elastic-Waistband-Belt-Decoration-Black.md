      <li>The metal part is REAL metal and gold in color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the model must be about 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; becaue this looks much bigger in the picture than it actually is.  </li>
      <li>Love the belt, you can bend the metal a little so that it lies flatter.  </li>
      <li>This is a very cute belt but the elasticity of it is for a very small waist young lady.</li>
      <li>The elastic is black and very stretchy, so don&#x27;t be fooled by how short it appears in the package, it will fit!</li>
      <li>I would be much happier if it was a smaller size</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m selling mine or giving it away if I dont wear it in at least two more months.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a little frustrating that it&#x27;s not more curved to fit your body better.</li>

<li> It will come to you flat but bend it ever so slightly so that it will lay curved around your waist.  </li>
<li> it was everything I expected.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s worth the money for a random fashion statement.</li>
<li> It fits a little snug due to the tight elastic but overall</li>
<li> Wonky clasp.  </li>
<li> was so mad</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sturdy but the metal is in no way painful.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m sure the model must be about 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; becaue this looks much bigger in the picture than it actually is.  I like it though so it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> The belt is super cute. It&#x27;s just a little frustrating that it&#x27;s not more curved to fit your body better.</li>
