### Positive Reviews

      <li>I was impressed .So</li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t the the best way to go.  </li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t the the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are greatly reduced, though, by using the product twice a day.</li>
      <li>Another great Dr Brandt Skincare product.</li>
      <li>I have never seen her this happy with one of these creams.</li>
      <li>There is a pleasant scent of lavender.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant odor and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>I had a sample of this product and was impressed by it when I used it, so I decided to buy a full sized one</li>
      <li>Happy with product, feels quite nice around eye area, skin looking more refreshed !</li>
      <li>First of all, the packaging was impressive.</li>
      <li>The Dr. Brandt was easy to apply and had a very nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>There is a nice blend of emollients and film forming agents that produce a temporary tightening feeling - but not appearance - in the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it does make a nice eye cream.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, no too strong and not overly perfumed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells absolutely great, by the way, and it seems to be a very fine, light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Just a pleasant, clean smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure, reading the ingredients, what in it would be at all effective.</li>
      <li>This is a product that interested me a great deal.</li>
      <li>i do not have many wrinkles, and the ones I do are very fine (around eyes and across fore head).  </li>
      <li>It says its safe to use</li>
      <li>More so, I was focusing on the crease between my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>That said, I already moisturize and do acid peels, so this product isn&#x27;t going to magically transform my skin.</li>
      <li>I think needles will always be needed if you want to be wrinkle free !</li>
      <li>the lines are much more pronounced.</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>the plus side the solution has a pleasant aroma and the texture feels soothing – much like Nivea</li>
      <li>All in all, I am impressed and would be interested in trying more of this line of facial products.</li>
      <li>She said that it would take considerably longer, say 2 months, to be able to fairly  judge the results.</li>
      <li>film-forming stuff like polymethyl methacrylate, which might blur fine lines but aren&#x27;t going to take care of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>To her, they are huge, and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
      <li>I notice a huge difference in the morning if I have forgotten to apply the product the night before...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s tempting to try these things out and fortunately, I got to do that for free.  </li>
      <li>I get more results worth reports as times goes on</li>
      <li>I enjoy that it looks like they may be &amp;#34;prescription&amp;#34; products.  </li>
      <li>I would use this cream when I am going out for the evening or to an important event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For those that have fine to light wrinkling this is a decent topical option that will help you look your best.</li>
      <li>My wife is much more expressive than I am so she tends to form lines on her forehead when she&#x27;s feeling extreme stress.</li>
      <li>and it goes on super smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>A small amount is dispensed with the pump, perfect for spot treating those pesky wrinkles.</li>
      <li>but I just don&#x27;t see a significant difference each time I use it.</li>
      <li>The serum is silky and smooth and seemed to blend into my skin quickly.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent - a mild blend of lavender and chamomile</li>
      <li>On a quick trip home, I bought some of this, hoping it was worth the try.</li>
      <li>I have decided this product is worth the money for me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this religiously twice a day, morning &amp; night, and can honestly say that I&#x27;ve seen no improvement.</li>
      <li>, all I can really say is, chances are if you apply this product as part of a structured program and don&#x27;t squint, smile or frown thereafter, the probability the look of expression lines will improve is pretty strong.amount is either, but at these prices I&#x27;m pretty sure caking it on like you&#x27;re attempting to fill the crevices in window frame</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say at this price point this might be worth giving a shot.</li>
      <li>So, all I can really say is, chances are if you apply this product as part of a structured program and don&#x27;t squint, smile or frown thereafter, the probability the look of expression lines will improve is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>This product touts itself as a replacement for Botox, &amp;#34;needles no more&amp;#34;, and makes some pretty bold claims of &amp;</li>
      <li>It blends well, goes right into the skin.</li>
      <li>I do feel a tingely sensation right after application.</li>
      <li>As a cream though for small areas it is great.</li>
      <li>At first indeed, the lines looked somewhat diminished and smoother.</li>
      <li>The first day</li>
      <li>I will include the list of ingredients, and the first couple of ingredients are water and shea butter.</li>
      <li>I also had an issue, for the first time, with a clogged pore under my eye on the lower lid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>my first impressions:</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, easy to obtain, clear visual results.</li>
      <li>I referred to my title and positive way.</li>
      <li>I can feel tingling on my forehead when I put it on but barely see any significant change in the wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
      <li>I have tried similar products over the years and most have a very modest effect that is temporary.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For short term effect, this product will soften fine lines.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do have some fine lines that noticeable as well as one deep crease.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For short term effect, this product will soften fine lines.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference after using this for a week around my eyes, but I can say, it did seem to be working on the fine lines on my forehead, and I did see an actual difference immediately.  </li>
      <li>This stuff straight up does not work.</li>
      <li>Maybe I am expecting to much</li>
      <li>The label is very &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; looking.  </li>
      <li>It has no odor really</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of wrinkles on my face</li>
      <li>I really like the way my face looks when I&#x27;m using Dr. Brandt&#x27;s Needles</li>
      <li>That said, I noticed absolutely nothing from this product.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using lots of different skin creams and lotions, and have had decent luck with them as far as wrinkles and skin tone.  </li>
      <li>Some disappear, while others are simply less prominent.</li>
      <li>If this stuff combated age related sag leading to triple chin, yeah maybe, but I&#x27;m more likely to grow a beard and call it a look.  </li>
      <li>When you remove the top of the bottle, you pump a small amount into your finger and place on whatever lines you are interested in softening.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to follow a regimen of twice per day application any more than I am likely to scrub my face with some cleansing astringent on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>so I asked my fiancee (11 years older) to try it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the recommended amount is either, but at these prices I&#x27;m pretty sure caking it on like you&#x27;re attempting to fill the crevices in window frame</li>
      <li>the claims of mimicking the effects of Botox are highly exaggerated.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That I am lazy is evident but more to the point, crow&#x27;s feet and forehead wrinkles just don&#x27;t rate very high on my list of personal concerns.</li>
      <li>Look: when you give your product a super provocative name, you need to make sure it actually has active ingredients that could possibly maybe do even some of what you claim.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;d paid the price for this cream, I&#x27;d probably earn a new &amp;#34;expression line.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>wherei now live.</li>
      <li>My low expectations, that this is just another snake oil, were met, but its a tad better than I expected.</li>
      <li>By the way I was a complete skeptic before I tried it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a pretty big difference.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to use it somewhat consistently for a week which is tragically short of the promoted time frame of four weeks before clearly discernible improvement in the appearance of expression lines can be anticipated</li>
      <li>It definitely looks less defined and the skin appears to be more &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34; instead of looking like a desert</li>
      <li>or so my eyes were sensitive to the cream, but that seems to have stopped.</li>
      <li>The effects are achieved by a noticeable tightening action that holds up for a couple of hours and during this time prevents the skin from contracting.</li>
      <li>I have some very slight crow&#x27;s feet crinkles along with light formations of &#x27;expression&#x27; lines across the forehead.</li>
      <li>They work for about an hour, and then your face goes back to normal.  </li>
      <li>Considering the mild effect and the high price, not to mention the extremely small quantity (only .5 oz)</li>
      <li>Also, it is sulfate free, and wrinkle cream without sulfate is hard to find.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I’m one of those lucky people who has very little facial creasing at my ripe old age.  </li>
      <li>I have a deep wrinkle right between my eyes which has bothered me for quite a few years.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to accurately gauge how long the product will last</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just acknowledge from the outset in my opinion this product requires a degree of discipline in application on a daily basis to achieve even modest improvement in long term effects that I simply do not possess.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Still waiting for results...I have used on my forehead for the past two weeks and don&#x27;t really see any results.  I do feel a tingely sensation right after application. The packaging says instantly releases creases and erase expression lines. Not seeing that yet; will continue to use the remainder of the bottle and post if there&#x27;s a change.</li>
    <li> This is a product that interested me a great deal. The information on the package and bottle stated this product would diminish the appearance of wrinkle lines. Those lines on your forehead, under eyes, around lips. I took a small amount and applied it to my crows feet and blended it into the lines. At first indeed, the lines looked somewhat diminished and smoother. I did not notice any lifting of my face around the lines, and after awhile, an hour or two my crows feet were back to it&#x27;s wrinkly appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is supposed to take the place of Botox injections, or at the least the effect is supposed to be equal to Botox. I have not had Botox, but I have seen the effects, and the softening of lines for an hour or two is not the same. I would use this cream when I am going out for the evening or to an important event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a 5 oz. brown bottle. When you remove the top of the bottle, you pump a small amount into your finger and place on whatever lines you are interested in softening. There is a pleasant scent of lavender. I will include the list of ingredients, and the first couple of ingredients are water and shea butter. Shea butter may be the product that softens the lines. There are 45 ingredients which also includes polyvinyl alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Perfluorohexane, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene, Perfluorodecalin, Butylene Glycol, Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Magnesium Gluconate, C12-16 Alcohols, Palmitic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Prolinamidoethyl Imidazole, Cetearyl Alcohol, Menthone Glycerin Acetal, Glutamylamidoethyl Imidazole, Tocopherol, Lecithin, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Chlorphenesin, Sodium Phytate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Silanediol Salicylate, Adenosine, Tromethamine, Linalool, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-52, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-18, Methylpropanediol, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For short term effect, this product will soften fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended For Short Term. prisrob 04-27-15ilis Flower Oil, Silanediol Salicylate, Adenosine, Tromethamine, Linalool, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-52, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-18, Methylpropanediol, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For short term effect, this product will soften fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended For Short Term. prisrob 04-27-15</li>
    <li> My wife HATES the lines on her forehead. She has been using this for a week and LOVES it. She claims that the lines are smoothing out. I think she is correct, however, I never really look at her forehead. She swears her skin feels smoother and the lines are going away. She uses it as directed, and puts on very little. I have never seen her this happy with one of these creams. So, while the affects seem minor, to me. To her, they are huge, and that&#x27;s what counts. So, five stars to Dr. Brandt!</li>
    <li> All hype - no substance - and at an outrageous price tag.  The Dr. Brandt at-home solution for wrinkle relaxing did zero to any line on my face.  I’m one of those lucky people who has very little facial creasing at my ripe old age.  I occasionally get the bug to try to eliminate those that I do have and have found some products that superficially “fill” a tiny bit.  Unfortunately Dr. Brandt Needles No More is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side the solution has a pleasant aroma and the texture feels soothing – much like Nivea cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big minus is that I personally think that any product that implies that it will work like Botox is setting itself up to disappoint its customers.  Thumbs down from me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week and I think I like it enough to continue with it. The first day or so my eyes were sensitive to the cream, but that seems to have stopped. It has no odor really and I like that and it goes on super smooth and easy. It pumps out just a little at a time, and I put it on my crows feet and forehead. I can&#x27;t tell yet about the wrinkles but my skin on those areas looks healthier and the cream does not irritate my skin, which is usually what happens with wrinkle creams. I will keep using it to see about the wrinkles being reduced a little, but I do like this cream. It is a little expensive, so well see if it does actually reduce wrinkles for me. As a cream though for small areas it is great.</li>
    <li> Okay. Let&#x27;s just acknowledge from the outset in my opinion this product requires a degree of discipline in application on a daily basis to achieve even modest improvement in long term effects that I simply do not possess.  I&#x27;m not going to follow a regimen of twice per day application any more than I am likely to scrub my face with some cleansing astringent on a daily basis. That I am lazy is evident but more to the point, crow&#x27;s feet and forehead wrinkles just don&#x27;t rate very high on my list of personal concerns. If this stuff combated age related sag leading to triple chin, yeah maybe, but I&#x27;m more likely to grow a beard and call it a look.  So, I suppose I could also state equally as forcefully, this stuff isn&#x27;t marketed towards people like me, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to use it somewhat consistently for a week which is tragically short of the promoted time frame of four weeks before clearly discernible improvement in the appearance of expression lines can be anticipated but I also know my commitment is destined to diminish so I&#x27;m not going to make any claims of coming back later to update because all I would have to add is sitting on a shelf in a cabinet in the bathroom has proven to be less than optimally effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One thing I can state unequivocally is as it relates to the benefits proclaimed the manufacturer&#x27;s test groups in the documentation after 60 seconds/15 minutes/1 hour of application, I&#x27;m unquestionably among the outliers who didn&#x27;t notice any changes. In fact, as compared with the [[ASIN:B000H723LU SK-II Facial Treatment Essence, 2.5 fl. oz.]] I didn&#x27;t really stop using to substitute this one (it&#x27;s adding to the collection of over-priced unused products currently populating the vanity cabinet), at least when I did try the SK product it felt like it was doing something. This stuff has a similar feel to the after shave lotion I typically use and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any efficacy like a sense of tightening or interaction. I&#x27;m not sure what the recommended amount is either, but at these prices I&#x27;m pretty sure caking it on like you&#x27;re attempting to fill the crevices in window frame isn&#x27;t the the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all I can really say is, chances are if you apply this product as part of a structured program and don&#x27;t squint, smile or frown thereafter, the probability the look of expression lines will improve is pretty strong.amount is either, but at these prices I&#x27;m pretty sure caking it on like you&#x27;re attempting to fill the crevices in window frame isn&#x27;t the the best way to go.  So, all I can really say is, chances are if you apply this product as part of a structured program and don&#x27;t squint, smile or frown thereafter, the probability the look of expression lines will improve is pretty strong.</li>
    <li> My low expectations were met I referred to my title and positive way. My low expectations, that this is just another snake oil, were met, but its a tad better than I expected. After a minute or two I did notice looking just a little bit tighter-looking around my eye area. I couldn&#x27;t note any actual difference in the wrinkles.  By the way, I only did one side of my face for the sake of science and helpful reviews. I&#x27;d say at this price point this might be worth giving a shot.</li>
    <li> Look: when you give your product a super provocative name, you need to make sure it actually has active ingredients that could possibly maybe do even some of what you claim. This stuff straight up does not work. It doesn&#x27;t have retinol in it, which might help with wrinkles... instead it&#x27;s got emollients like shea butter (which as a moisturizer, might make your face feel softer, but isn&#x27;t going to help with wrinkles) and film-forming stuff like polymethyl methacrylate, which might blur fine lines but aren&#x27;t going to take care of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research about the ingredients on this stuff and NOPE NOPE NOPE: there&#x27;s literally no evidence that the ingredients contained do anything they say they&#x27;re going to do. It&#x27;s not even like &amp;#34;oh, it didn&#x27;t work for me&amp;#34;... the ingredients that would make it work on ANYONE are not contained in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your research carefully on this one before purchasing. It&#x27;s basically an overpriced wrinkle-filler cosmetic product that&#x27;s cynically named to exploit the misconception that lotions or cosmetics could give you results like Botox.</li>
    <li> Perhaps my wrinkles need an anti-depressant?  I&#x27;ve been using this on my forehead faithfully since I got it, and I don&#x27;t notice any change in the appearance of my &amp;#34;expression lines.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tempting to try these things out and fortunately, I got to do that for free.  If I&#x27;d paid the price for this cream, I&#x27;d probably earn a new &amp;#34;expression line.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I wanted to like the Dr. Brandt Needles No More product, and it does make a nice eye cream. However, that is not what this is being marketed for. There is a nice blend of emollients and film forming agents that produce a temporary tightening feeling - but not appearance - in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The scent - a mild blend of lavender and chamomile essential oil - is subtle and did not produce any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;But the claims of mimicking the effects of Botox are highly exaggerated.&lt;br /&gt;If you think of this as an expensive eye cream, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, stick with an anti-aging retinol product and save your money for a real Botox injection.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using lots of different skin creams and lotions, and have had decent luck with them as far as wrinkles and skin tone.  I have still had not much luck when it comes to forehead and frown lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seemed to make an overnight difference--and I was thinking it was in my head...so I asked my fiancee (11 years older) to try it.  He went for it, and I&#x27;m not kidding--he looked 10 years YOUNGER in a few days.  He even noticed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much--just a tiny bit, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was cheaper.  We tested this for Amazon (Vine) but can&#x27;t afford to continue it...90 bucks and it lasted about 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is an terrible product. What ever you do, do not use this cream on your eye lids. Caused me to have &amp;#34;droopy&amp;#34; eyelids. It says its safe to use but i do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bottom line: It works. Lines around my eyes are smoothed out. Some disappear, while others are simply less prominent. The deep furrow between my brows is definitely relaxed. I don&#x27;t look as severe. Skin all over feels smoother, looks younger. I don&#x27;t want to overstate anything. This isn&#x27;t the fountain of youth. But it works. I really like the way my face looks when I&#x27;m using Dr. Brandt&#x27;s Needles No More.  ps - It blends well, goes right into the skin.</li>
    <li> Dr. Brandt&#x27;s Needles No More serum is the first product I have ever tried by Dr. Brandt. I was impressed .So my first impressions: First of all, the packaging was impressive. I enjoy that it looks like they may be &amp;#34;prescription&amp;#34; products.  The label is very &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; looking.  A small amount is dispensed with the pump, perfect for spot treating those pesky wrinkles. The smell is pleasant, no too strong and not overly perfumed. Just a pleasant, clean smell. The serum is silky and smooth and seemed to blend into my skin quickly.  Second impressions:  it seems to have worked somewhat. I have a deep wrinkle right between my eyes which has bothered me for quite a few years. I decided to zero in on that spot for my product testing. I&#x27;ve noticed a pretty big difference. It definitely looks less defined and the skin appears to be more &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34; instead of looking like a desert wasteland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars is simply for the price. I have encountered other creams at a cheaper price that seem to produce similar effects. All in all, I am impressed and would be interested in trying more of this line of facial products.</li>
    <li> Happy with product, feels quite nice around eye area, skin looking more refreshed !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;needles no more&#x27; ?? I think needles will always be needed if you want to be wrinkle free !</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change by using so I stopped</li>
    <li> Dr. Brandt needles no more is supposed to decrease wrinkles.  I have tried similar products over the years and most have a very modest effect that is temporary.  While I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of wrinkles on my face I do have some fine lines that noticeable as well as one deep crease.  The Dr. Brandt was easy to apply and had a very nice fragrance.  It left a slight tingling sensation that went away after a few minutes.  Over the course of a week I did notice a slight improvement just like I did with some of the other products I have used.  These products all seem to have moisturizers and other ingredients that relax the skin and make the wrinkles less pronounced.  The problem is that once you stop using the product the wrinkles will come back.  Considering the mild effect and the high price, not to mention the extremely small quantity (only .5 oz) I can only give this 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I have some very slight crow&#x27;s feet crinkles along with light formations of &#x27;expression&#x27; lines across the forehead. For my milder wear and tear I will say that this &#x27;needles no more&#x27; product lives up to the task in smoothing out the issues. The effects are achieved by a noticeable tightening action that holds up for a couple of hours and during this time prevents the skin from contracting. The sensation is not at all unpleasant and the fragrance that emanates is both refreshing and perky all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only half an ounce of product in this compact pump bottle it&#x27;s hard to accurately gauge how long the product will last but if used daily on 2 or 3 spots on your face I estimate each bottle lasting about a month. For those that have fine to light wrinkling this is a decent topical option that will help you look your best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously twice a day, morning &amp; night, and can honestly say that I&#x27;ve seen no improvement. I&#x27;m 35 and have only faint crows feet. More so, I was focusing on the crease between my eyebrows. In neither area have I seen any improvement, not the faintest,  and the lines aren&#x27;t even that deep.  It also appears that this product may be enlarging my pores, or so it appears between my brows. I also had an issue, for the first time, with a clogged pore under my eye on the lower lid.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this to work and had high hopes after reading other online reviews but, sadly can&#x27;t recommend it. Especially given the hefty price!</li>
    <li> i used Dysport/ Botoxfor two years, then moved overseas and I don&#x27;t trust anyone to administer it wherei now live. On a quick trip home, I bought some of this, hoping it was worth the try. I have the &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;- two vertical lines between my eyebrows. This product doesn&#x27;t eliminate those lines. They are greatly reduced, though, by using the product twice a day. I notice a huge difference in the morning if I have forgotten to apply the product the night before... the lines are much more pronounced. I have decided this product is worth the money for me and I am buying another bottle. By the way I was a complete skeptic before I tried it!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Dr. Brandt Needles no more for about a week. Maybe I am expecting to much but I just don&#x27;t see a significant difference each time I use it. I can feel tingling on my forehead when I put it on but barely see any significant change in the wrinkles on my forehead. This is an expensive product to not see any real results by now. I will continue to use it and update my review if I experience anything different.</li>
    <li> My wife is much more expressive than I am so she tends to form lines on her forehead when she&#x27;s feeling extreme stress. As a teacher she has been under more stress lately with the year ending and everything wrapping up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She started using Dr. Brandt&#x27;s Needles No More and instantly saw a result on her forehead the next morning. The lines were already very faint but she&#x27;s already seeing results there that show they&#x27;ve gone down considerably. She mentioned that continued use has caused her lines to become fainter and her skin feels smoother. She loves the product and thinks it&#x27;s one of the few beauty products she&#x27;ll subscribe to keep buying despite its large cost. It is a small container but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a chemist, and have no idea what is in this stuff.  i do not have many wrinkles, and the ones I do are very fine (around eyes and across fore head).  I don&#x27;t see much of a difference after using this for a week around my eyes, but I can say, it did seem to be working on the fine lines on my forehead, and I did see an actual difference immediately.  I will report back and add to my review after I&#x27;ve used it after 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells absolutely great, by the way, and it seems to be a very fine, light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is really similar to those Estee Lauder creams that you buy.  They work for about an hour, and then your face goes back to normal.  I really like them for a night out, but as for every day use, I don&#x27;t see it as a long term solution due to the expense.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, so do I, works as hoped. Easy to apply, easy to obtain, clear visual results. Another great Dr Brandt Skincare product.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my sister.</li>
    <li> This product touts itself as a replacement for Botox, &amp;#34;needles no more&amp;#34;, and makes some pretty bold claims of &amp;#34;instantly relaxes lines&amp;#34;. I do get botox, and not even botox works &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; (takes about a week to set in). The thing with Botox, is that around 3 months it starts to wear off, and I schedule my appointments at about 5 months out. So I&#x27;m always looking for skin care products that might help stretch out the results or even improve the results. That said, I noticed absolutely nothing from this product. I&#x27;m not even sure, reading the ingredients, what in it would be at all effective. It has some moisturizing qualities, and also some acid peel type ingredients. That said, I already moisturize and do acid peels, so this product isn&#x27;t going to magically transform my skin. The price of this is around $90 for 0.5 oz and will last you maybe 2 months. I pay $250 for Botox every 5 months. So comparatively, this costs the same as Botox, except Botox actually does something for me, and this does nothing!</li>
    <li> I had my daughter test this. She said that it would take considerably longer, say 2 months, to be able to fairly  judge the results. So far, she has noticed that the solution makes small lines less noticeable. It has a pleasant odor and is not greasy. Also, it is sulfate free, and wrinkle cream without sulfate is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;If I get more results worth reports as times goes on I&#x27;ll add to this review.</li>
    <li> Does not make a difference</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this product and was impressed by it when I used it, so I decided to buy a full sized one</li>
    <li> It really works on the lines between the eyebrows however for the lines under the eyes it is not effective.</li>
    <li> I have used this wrinkle relaxer for three days without noticeable changes except for one; today I woke with a painful, although small, lump right at the edge of my eye socket where the crows feet begin.  It did not improve during the day, so I conclude that I am reacting to some ingredient in this product.  I have been careful to keep the product away from my eyes, so they are fine, but this lump is something I have never experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the product for me. I will not be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE STAR!</li>
