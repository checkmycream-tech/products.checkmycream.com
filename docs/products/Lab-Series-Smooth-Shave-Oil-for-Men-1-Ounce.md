### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was really impressed!</li>
      <li>Oh well.. Still the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>Expensive,but with excellent results.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>This shave oil is great.</li>
      <li>But it works great with my electric razor if you want to know.</li>
      <li>With shaving oil and a good five-blade razor</li>
      <li>LAB series creates the perfect balance of oil to create a smooth shave glide.  </li>
      <li>This one, however, is too watery to use on its own.  </li>
      <li>It washes off nicely and helps to keep my skin protected from the razor.</li>
      <li>I am able to use on their own for a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>I would like to save more on the shipping by ordering six at a time.</li>
      <li>I have used most of the shave oils out there.</li>
      <li>but dont love it,</li>
      <li>This one has the most cushioning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It helps for a great sheve and leaves your skin soft and nice.</li>
      <li>I have been using this prodict for 2 or more years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I find myself using this as a prep and still needing shave cream on top of this to make it a smooth shave ..</li>
      <li>This is a very smooth oil, that works evenly and cleanly to help with morning shaves.  </li>
      <li>IT does work fine if I use it it as a layer under shave cream.  </li>
      <li>and I get a smooth close shave.</li>
      <li>This product works for smooth shaving.</li>
      <li>I chose this rating because I&#x27;ve tried other products of this kind, and this one felt superior.</li>
      <li>Great oil for wet shavers, no scent and stays on for shave in shower.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is the product for sure.</li>
      <li>I believe an ounce will last me easily a year on my neck.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, apply on fresh washed face, works great applied in shower as it has time to relax the beard</li>
      <li>While the viscosity feels slightly lighter than Clinique&#x27;s product, the Lab Series product produces the same great results at a lower price point.</li>
      <li>so was very apprehensive, until my shaver touched my skin.</li>
      <li>The formulation of this Lab Series&#x27; shave oil product appears to be very close to Clinique&#x27;s product</li>
      <li>Adding a bit of water to your face after application makes it even more slippery, which is why I would say to be careful when shaving in the shower.</li>
      <li>This product is so important for protecting facial skin during the shaving process.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got almost no scent, lubricates like crazy and gives a great shave!</li>
      <li>WOW!!!</li>
      <li>The package isn&#x27;t pressurized so it&#x27;s easy to travel with and dispose of once empty.  </li>
      <li>but overall it&#x27;s a super product.</li>
      <li>I use a Schick Hydro 5 (with the vibrating handle) - I&#x27;ve tried a number of shave gels - Gillette Fusion/ too thick, King of Shaves (too gooey), Crew (actually pretty good, but expensive and the containers break) - eventually decided to try shave oils - King of shaves - OK, but kinda thin - I took a chance on Lab Series after trying a sample of their all-in-one face treatment ( which was really good!).</li>
      <li>Seems to have a little more body than the others</li>
      <li>: It&#x27;s actually kind of hard to get off your hands, so I apply with my left, shave with my right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the Lab Series isn&#x27;t my favorite shaving oil (I&#x27;m still searching for &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;); it&#x27;s less slick and absorbs fairly quickly (which could be a benefit if you shave after your shower, but I do it beforehand and any residual oil is washed off).  </li>
      <li>I think i found a better product with John Allens Slick Water ..</li>
      <li>I ordered several more as part of a gift for the other males in my family.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Way expensive for only 1 ounce but a great dispense method allows control over amount needed/used.</li>
      <li>After using this product, all of that has nearly gone away.</li>
      <li>and I only have used it on the neck since it is so sensitive.</li>
      <li>This stuff is so slick that when i rinse after shaving in the shower I find slick spots under foot which could cause an accident - it is that effective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The formulation of this Lab Series&#x27; shave oil product appears to be very close to Clinique&#x27;s product (perhaps the two brands are product lines of the same company). While the viscosity feels slightly lighter than Clinique&#x27;s product, the Lab Series product produces the same great results at a lower price point.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Once you&#x27;ve tried it, you won&#x27;t want to do without!</li>
    <li> I think i found a better product with John Allens Slick Water .. its a bit thicker than the Lab Series Lightweight Shave oil .. I guess thats why they call it Lightweight .. and it is .. I find myself using this as a prep and still needing shave cream on top of this to make it a smooth shave .. but with John Allens I dont need the shave cream .. still the same slick shave.. and for the price per ounce .. this is more expensive .. I like it now .. but dont love it, like I used to</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I&#x27;ve tried other products of this kind, and this one felt superior. It also was less expensive. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered the product and will continue to order it in the future. The only negative is that they didn&#x27;t have over two in stock. I would like to save more on the shipping by ordering six at a time.</li>
    <li> This product is so important for protecting facial skin during the shaving process. My face used to become so red when I shaved. It was so bad that I thought that I had acne. After using this product, all of that has nearly gone away. Wow! What a difference.</li>
    <li> LAB series creates the perfect balance of oil to create a smooth shave glide.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This shave oil is great. A little goes a long way.

    <li> My husband loves this stuff! I ordered several more as part of a gift for the other males in my family.</li>
    <li> Hubby has used this for years.</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth oil, that works evenly and cleanly to help with morning shaves.  It washes off nicely and helps to keep my skin protected from the razor.</li>
    <li> Expensive,but with excellent results.I&#x27;ll take that any day..Using this product has made my shaves faster and smoother.</li>
    <li> I have been using this prodict for 2 or more years.&lt;br /&gt;It helps for a great sheve and leaves your skin soft and nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This product works for smooth shaving. It&#x27;s very slippery tho, little hard to wash off even with cleanser. but overall it&#x27;s a super product.</li>

I was really impressed! It&#x27;s got almost no scent, lubricates like crazy and gives a great shave! Downside: It&#x27;s actually kind of hard to get off your hands, so I apply with my left, shave with my right. Oh well.. Still the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, apply on fresh washed face, works great applied in shower as it has time to relax the beard</li>
    <li> Got a couple sample packs from Birchbox a few months ago. Never thought I would use them so put in my medicine cabinet. I use a Norelco 2d shaver and my neck always breaks out and is painful after shaving. So a few days ago I decided to try it. Was surprised it is a very thin and slick oil so was very apprehensive, until my shaver touched my skin. WOW!!! The 3 heads glided over my neck like they were on ice. The packs are only 0.06 ounces and I only have used it on the neck since it is so sensitive. Just looked at the price and was slightly shocked but found an ounce on eBay for $24 so bought that. I believe an ounce will last me easily a year on my neck. If you have sensitive skin, this is the product for sure. Do not use it where you aren&#x27;t since it is so expensive. But it works great with my electric razor if you want to know.</li>
    <li> If you value a close shave like me, oil is definitely the way to go.  First of all, the package is small and you&#x27;re not paying for a bunch of isobutane.  The package isn&#x27;t pressurized so it&#x27;s easy to travel with and dispose of once empty.  With shaving oil and a good five-blade razor my shave is soooo close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the Lab Series isn&#x27;t my favorite shaving oil (I&#x27;m still searching for &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;); it&#x27;s less slick and absorbs fairly quickly (which could be a benefit if you shave after your shower, but I do it beforehand and any residual oil is washed off).  There&#x27;s more expensive oils out there, but it&#x27;s still fairly expensive; I bought a shaving oil at Walmart for $3 that worked like a dream and lasted three months.</li>
    <li> Way expensive for only 1 ounce but a great dispense method allows control over amount needed/used. Great oil for wet shavers, no scent and stays on for shave in shower. Would only say it&#x27;s a bit too expensive for such a small amount of shave oil.</li>
    <li> I have used most of the shave oils out there. This one has the most cushioning. Seems to have a little more body than the others and I get a smooth close shave.</li>
    <li> Both Kiehls and Art of Shaving oils I am able to use on their own for a close and comfortable shave.  This one, however, is too watery to use on its own.  IT does work fine if I use it it as a layer under shave cream.  Of course everyone&#x27;s beard is different so your mileage may vary.</li>
