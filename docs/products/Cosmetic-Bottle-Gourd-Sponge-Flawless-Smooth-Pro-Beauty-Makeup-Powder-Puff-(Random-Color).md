    <li> ... then I realized it was &amp;#34;Made in China.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ll use the  ones &amp;#34;Made in America&amp;#34; applicators.</li>
    <li> I hated it, when I tried applying makeup to my face that sponge rubbed off onto me. It was very cheap and gross</li>
    <li> I like how the shape makes it fit better in my hand while in use. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Super soft, I love to grab it. It blends nicely as expected. Great price compared to local beauty stores. I recommend this product for use as a blender.</li>

    <li> Just received this a couple days ago. Very smooth and soft, blends makeup very well. shape makes it very easy to grasp and use either end. happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> definitely not a dupe for the Beauty Blender but works in a pinch. a little rough and solid but its affordable.</li>
    <li> I have heard good things about this style beauty blender.  This sponge works fine but it is nothing I have to have.  I&#x27;m not sure if the name brand blender would work better but it cost $20.00 and I am not paying that for a sponge.  This one works fine.</li>
    <li> Love this little sponge!! Talk about magically blending. I&#x27;m stock piling these little babies for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I expected this to be like the beauty sponge I had currently, but it is much more stiff (not as soft/ squishy) and doesn&#x27;t really blend well at all.</li>

    <li> it is not eve close the real thing and smelled really bad</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I dont really use it, rather use brush.</li>
    <li> Very rough. Not good on my face</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in my beauty habits! Better then buying on in a store for like $10.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the product but it wasn&#x27;t as pictured</li>
    <li> I got this product.. But it&#x27;s take longer before I got this..</li>
    <li> This item is a bust and is nothing like the cosmetic sponge it claims it is. A sponge is suppose to expand when wet. This product did not do that and was rough when trying to apply. The price was nice.</li>
    <li> Arrived in excellent condition. Works great, blends quick n smooth.</li>
    <li> I ordered one before and it was larger than the one I got now it&#x27;s really small I but I love the first one that I got</li>
    <li> I just received this. The envelope said phone case? It&#x27;s not even a phone case.</li>
    <li> Makes foundation super flawless</li>
    <li> horrible. it didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Kind of stiff. Not very soft. Will purchase another product that is softer. Not what i expected. Overall, as described.</li>
