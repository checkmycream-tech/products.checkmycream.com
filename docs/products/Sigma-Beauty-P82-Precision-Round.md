      <li>i love sigma!ands</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite brushes.  </li>
      <li>I love Sigma, always have and always will.</li>
      <li>I love the segman brushes have order several of them and the are the best.</li>
      <li>This brush makes my concealer full coverage, it also defuses the product into the skin better!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT for concealer under the eyes, around the nose or pretty much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft ( as all sigma brushes are) and a great brush for blending under eye concealer or eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>I also use it for blemishes or any slight skin imperfections and it works wonderfully on that as well.</li>
      <li>once i had it and used it, OMG, excellent to covert with powder and sell concealer in the under eye area, to fill every little line and detail in your face</li>
      <li>I use it primarily for blending cream shadows to blend and smooth out the edges.  </li>
      <li>i would definitely recommend it for anyone, i myself have an oily t-zone &amp; this works great in those areas.</li>
      <li>you want precise detail</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite brush!</li>
      <li>and I love that this brush mimics exactly that.</li>
      <li>I love this brush so much !</li>
      <li>So easy to clean and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Sigma Precision Round - P82 is very good.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft, and wash nicely.</li>
      <li>Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors.</li>
      <li>The Sigma brushes are very soft and cute.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brush, I use it for concealer everyday and it blends it in so amazingly.</li>
      <li>Worth spending the money.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the splurge.</li>
      <li>I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment.</li>
      <li>Second, when I opened up the packaging the first thing I noticed about the brush was how nice and sleek it looked.</li>
      <li>Its really great for small areas</li>
      <li>Would buy more of the same brand.</li>
      <li>, I love it, don&#x27;t use it often enough for some reason.</li>
      <li>Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I love these brushes and have them in in the performance eyes kit and the mr bunny essential sigma max kit.</li>
      <li>A lot cheaper than Mac brushes but same or better quality.</li>
      <li>good little brush!</li>
      <li>I like Sigma brushes and have three of the large Kabuki brushes that I use and adore.  </li>
      <li>Within a week of ordering I received it, the shipping was extremely fast.</li>
      <li>The Sigma P82 is an absolute must for under eye concealing.</li>
      <li>The head is tiny but super dense,</li>
      <li>but it is too big and stiff to do a good job of it.  </li>
      <li>It is also so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
      <li>were the big brushes like kabukis cant go and deliver powder this really does.</li>
      <li>The bristle are very concentrated and I have not had any fall out even with regular washing.</li>
      <li>When I touched it, I noticed how soft and dense (but not harsh dense)</li>
      <li>First of all, the package came faster than I had expected!</li>
      <li>Feels exactly like using my pinky finger to apply primer or blend eyeshadows, except without the mess left on my hands afterwards.</li>
      <li>I use it to apply my concelaer and it really helps cover my dark under eye circles !</li>
      <li>A tad expensive in my opinion for such a small brush, but Sigma brushes are easy to clean and last a long time without any shedding</li>

    <li> This Sigma P82 brush is great for blending on the lid. The head is tiny but super dense, so &amp;#34;fingertip-like application&amp;#34; is 100% correct!

Thank you sigma for another great brush to add to my collection!! ( which is all sigma by the way) lol.</li>

    <li> OH MY GOSH&lt;br /&gt;This brush is the best! First of all, the package came faster than I had expected! When I got it, it was in a box. I liked that because I knew it was taken good care of. Second, when I opened up the packaging the first thing I noticed about the brush was how nice and sleek it looked. When I touched it, I noticed how soft and dense (but not harsh dense) It&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT for concealer under the eyes, around the nose or pretty much any where! If you&#x27;re looking for something to purchase here on amazon, BUY THIS BRUSH!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> I like Sigma brushes and have three of the large Kabuki brushes that I use and adore.  But I&#x27;m not sure what this one is meant to be used for.  I bought it to blend/apply cream eyeshadow but it is too big and stiff to do a good job of it.  It is also too stiff to apply concealer especially around the eye area -- too much tugging on the skin.  So unless there is another use I am not thinking of, I recommend passing on this brush!</li>
