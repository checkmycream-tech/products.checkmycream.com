      <li>Great for my kids eczema!</li>
      <li>These pods are great!</li>
      <li>These bubble pods are great!</li>
      <li>Best bubbles I have found yet!  </li>
      <li>but best bubbles</li>
      <li>they might want to take an awesome bubble bath.</li>
      <li>Love these!!!!</li>
      <li>Pods work great for bath bubble time.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>These are great -- they provide a lot of bubbles and don&#x27;t have any scent at all.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a win on that side as well.    </li>
      <li>Great product, dissolves well and has not irritated my sons skin.</li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s good for eczema is great</li>
      <li>So each pod is perfect for one time use, unless you have more than one kid on the tub</li>
      <li>One pod made nice bubbles, but since I was filling up a whirlpool tub I used two, and I got a great amount of bubbles.  </li>
      <li>Makes good bubbles, but may also make your bathroom smell.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love!!!!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love these bubbles!</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>The bubbles are great, but the soft skin is the best reason to buy these for my kids :)</li>
      <li>I find that if you put the podz right under the spout when you fill up your tub, it will make a great bubbly bath.  </li>
      <li>I purchased them more for soothing than bubbles.</li>
      <li>As for the bubble, they don&#x27;t really make lots of bubbles, but that&#x27;s okay for me and my son, since he already is happy playing with the toys in the tub anyway.</li>
      <li>and you need more than 1 pod.</li>
      <li>Love this bubble bath pod.</li>
      <li>Any residue in the tub will start to stink as the organic ingredients rot, so make sure to rinse it away.</li>
      <li>Boys love how it disappears in the water.</li>
      <li>The way I use these is to let the water chew away at the pod while I hold it in the stream, that nets me the most bubbles.</li>
      <li>We love these bubbles.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about the pod size is you don&#x27;t need to worry about measuring the liquid bubble bath like the regular ones.</li>
      <li>We have already ordered more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been able to  eliminate moisturizing their skin after each bath as well.</li>
      <li>and my kids STILL love these bubbles.</li>
      <li>My kids love the bubbles that these podz create.</li>
      <li>Not too many bubbles,  </li>
      <li>They like to hold it under he running water til it breaks apart :)</li>
      <li>Wait 5 minutes then apply the trukid eczema cream on top of that.  </li>
      <li>Kids love it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say this helped my son&#x27;s eczema, but it sure did not aggravate it.</li>
      <li>; so don&#x27;t expect a ton from one pod, but you could use more than one pod if you wanted.</li>
      <li>Love these Bubble Podz and all tru-kid products.</li>
      <li>Pretty good bubbles with 2 or more pods in softened water.</li>
      <li>Best bubble I ever bought in a long time!</li>
      <li>Bubbles, if started at the beginning with a good forceful flow into the bath can easily produce bubble foam that gets higher than the edge of the bath.</li>
      <li>The hardness of your water will surely make a difference, but here in the east, with medium hardness, they were working fine.</li>
      <li>son has sensitive skin and this is great...  </li>
      <li>We only use one pod at a time but agitate the water with our hands and it produces an incredible amount of bubbles.</li>
      <li>but I agree with other reviewers: the bubbles are awesome and the formula helps my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
      <li>I use one pod and like it because the bubbles are almost gone and easy to wash away when bath time is over.</li>
      <li>Seem to work great for my 4 year old son&#x27;s light eczema.</li>
      <li>Convenient and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Water pressure makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>But when I found these and they actually worked, we were so happy.</li>
      <li>but this product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>But I guess it&#x27;s ok since it&#x27;s such a good product.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of good old fashioned bubbles.  </li>
      <li>Original review:  </li>
      <li>And he&#x27;s CLEAN, too.</li>
      <li>I love that they are easy to use, no mess or spilling.</li>
      <li>Bubbles last longer than many cheap overrated bubbles out there.</li>
      <li>They reformulated their product and it takes 2 pods to produce the bubbles that they use to but even so these produce far more bubbles than any bubble product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I would repurchase this product, the ingredients are safe and natural, they don&#x27;t hurt my son&#x27;s eyes, and you can use the residual water to water the plant.</li>
      <li>Well worth three money.</li>
      <li>I also love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about his sensitive skin reacting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My grandson and I make bath time fun and exciting with these tablets.  </li>
      <li>The pods make his skin so soft, and healthy.</li>
      <li>I paid $19 for 24-pods, and you need a minimum of 2, better if you use 3,  to have a good thick bubble layer.</li>
      <li>These natural bubble podz are wonderful for kids who have dry and/or sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I am willing to pay more for something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my kids skin and that we can use with every bath (my kids are young).</li>
      <li>I was skeptical that an oatmeal-based product that would actually be good for the skin of a child with eczema would really produce good foamy bubbles</li>
      <li>They also dissolve very well and quickly.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes great bubbles that really last the entire bath time.</li>
      <li>After her first bath with these bubbles she has not a bump or rash to speak of.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this for my son&#x27;s bath I used two pods not expecting a lot.</li>
      <li>I used two pods and there is MORE then enough bubbles in there.  </li>
      <li>I will add that it doesn&#x27;t work immediately, but we remained consistent with having a pod or two at each bath time, and I can say that as of today, the girls have not had any flareups.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s made for a much easier bath time routine for all of us!</li>
      <li>Seriously, this is a GREAT product.</li>
      <li>They last a long time (still plenty of bubbles after bath is over) and leave my daughters skin nice and smooth and soft!  </li>
      <li>These bubbles actually do moisturize my sons skin and leave it feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t dissolve very well.</li>
      <li>If you just drop it in, you won&#x27;t get much.     </li>
      <li>One pod is plenty - two was a bit too much at once.</li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything like it.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>This really works.</li>
      <li>They smell good and my child&#x27;s skin doesn&#x27;t react negatively to it.</li>
      <li>try doing that with most other types of bath products even Johnson and Johnson.  </li>
      <li>We only use the pods twice a week, so it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>As she gets older we may need to increase to 2 pods per bath.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I have finally found the only product on the planet that not only is safe for my sons excruciating eczema, but it has cleared it up in 2 weeks!  </li>
      <li>Finally my little one can enjoy a bubble bath!</li>
      <li>My 2 year-old son had a patch of really stubborn eczema near his elbow, and after ONE bath with these pods, it is gone.</li>
      <li>My favorite bubble bath for my toddler, who has mild eczema that can get much worse without attention.  </li>
      <li>I would buy it again for a child who doesn&#x27;t have eczema, just because it is mild, doesn&#x27;t have a strong annoying scent, and makes nice bubbles.</li>
      <li>The bubbles last a long time, so he is free to make all the imaginary things he wants.  </li>

    <li> Great for my kids eczema!</li>
    <li> They reformulated their product and it takes 2 pods to produce the bubbles that they use to but even so these produce far more bubbles than any bubble product I&#x27;ve ever used. The bubbles also last a really long time. Well worth three money.</li>
    <li> These are terrific!&lt;br /&gt;My son has sensitive skin and this is great...  It doesn&#x27;t bother him either when it gets in his eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is he won&#x27;t take a bath without them now!</li>
    <li> These are quite pricey - but I agree with other reviewers: the bubbles are awesome and the formula helps my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> Love this bubble bath pod. Makes lots of bubbles. Boys love how it disappears in the water. Noticed with new packaging pods are smaller but not less bubbles.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes great bubbles that really last the entire bath time. One pod is plenty - two was a bit too much at once. Not sure I can say it works wonders for my son&#x27;s excema but it doesn&#x27;t make it worse or dry out his skin. The packaging says it&#x27;s safe to ingest but will taste bad - although I don&#x27;t encourage it, that doesn&#x27;t stop my boys from drinking the bath water. Used with 3 year old and 18 month old.</li>
    <li> Great product, dissolves well and has not irritated my sons skin. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> My favorite bubble bath for my toddler, who has mild eczema that can get much worse without attention.  This bubbly bath does not irritate or make it worse and he really likes that are in little packs - its fun for him.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> My two girls have both struggled with Eczema flareups and it&#x27;s been a challenge to find a product that works. Well, I&#x27;ve finally found that in the TruKid Eczema Care Bubble Podz.  I will add that it doesn&#x27;t work immediately, but we remained consistent with having a pod or two at each bath time, and I can say that as of today, the girls have not had any flareups. I&#x27;ve also been able to  eliminate moisturizing their skin after each bath as well. I do still moisturize, but not as frequently and it&#x27;s made for a much easier bath time routine for all of us!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this helped my son&#x27;s eczema, but it sure did not aggravate it. It makes TONS of bubbles. I would buy it again for a child who doesn&#x27;t have eczema, just because it is mild, doesn&#x27;t have a strong annoying scent, and makes nice bubbles.</li>
    <li> I got these because my daughter kept getting heat rash. She is only 6 months and we bathe her in a plastic baby tub. They create a small amount of bubbles (nothing like the image portrays). I purchased them more for soothing than bubbles. My husband likes the ease of just throwing a pod in the tub and not stressing. I do believe they help with her heat rash and make her skin soft. However, you have to be careful not to get any moisture in the bag (like a wet hand from testing the water temp) or all the pods stick together. They are expensive for what you get. We only use the pods twice a week, so it&#x27;s not bad. I would not recommend these for large tubs or everyday use because of the cost.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that an oatmeal-based product that would actually be good for the skin of a child with eczema would really produce good foamy bubbles but this product is fantastic. We only use one pod at a time but agitate the water with our hands and it produces an incredible amount of bubbles. My son just loves it and his skin has actually improved so much since we started using it that we don&#x27;t even have to put cream on him every night, just once or twice a week. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love/hate.  Convenient, good ingredients, decent bubbles but terribly terribly expensive.</li>
    <li> One of my children has eczema,  the other 2 have sensitive skin. Regular bubble bath dries out their skin and irritates it.  These pods are great! Not too many bubbles,  but I feel there&#x27;s enough. They like to hold it under he running water til it breaks apart :)</li>
    <li> Not an exaggeration, this is the ONLY bubble bath product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my daughter&#x27;s severe eczema break out. I had given up on bubble baths, just not worth making her skin worse. But when I found these and they actually worked, we were so happy. She LOVES the bubbles! And since she puts &#x27;everything&#x27; in her mouth, I don&#x27;t stress with this brand because all the ingredients are natural.  Not overly &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; so don&#x27;t expect a ton from one pod, but you could use more than one pod if you wanted. I use one pod and like it because the bubbles are almost gone and easy to wash away when bath time is over. Love these!!!!</li>
    <li> I use these almost daily for my 2 year old that suffers from eczema.  He does still receive a 15 minute soak without any soap, but these work well after outdoor play.</li>
    <li> These are great -- they provide a lot of bubbles and don&#x27;t have any scent at all. They have helped my son who had been complaining that he was itchy all the time -- he has complained about itchy skin much less since using this product. They also dissolve very well and quickly.</li>
    <li> I never seen bubble pods in the market before, so I grabbed this since my old son loves to do bubble bath during summer time. The best thing about the pod size is you don&#x27;t need to worry about measuring the liquid bubble bath like the regular ones. So each pod is perfect for one time use, unless you have more than one kid on the tub and you need more than 1 pod. As for the bubble, they don&#x27;t really make lots of bubbles, but that&#x27;s okay for me and my son, since he already is happy playing with the toys in the tub anyway. I would repurchase this product, the ingredients are safe and natural, they don&#x27;t hurt my son&#x27;s eyes, and you can use the residual water to water the plant.</li>
    <li> These are not the cheapest but work GREAT!  I used two pods and there is MORE then enough bubbles in there.  I could probably get away with just one.  I have soft water so this may factor into it but best bubbles I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
    <li> Yes, the price may seem daunting, but you get what you pay for! If you have a child with eczema I cannot imagine that you would ever regret buying this product, because it works!! One little pod makes a lot of bubbles! It seems to cure and prevent eczema. It works within a few days for my child. Seriously, this is a GREAT product. I have ordered it twice now. Will order again!</li>
    <li> My grandson and I make bath time fun and exciting with these tablets.  He loves to hold them in his hands and watch them dissolve and rise into big bubbles.  The bubbles last a long time, so he is free to make all the imaginary things he wants.  I&#x27;ve been giving them as gifts and everyone loves them.</li>
    <li> Long lasting bubbles that make the kids skin soft and smooth. We have already ordered more.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t dissolve very well. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> My 2 year-old son had a patch of really stubborn eczema near his elbow, and after ONE bath with these pods, it is gone. The pods make his skin so soft, and healthy. And he&#x27;s CLEAN, too. The bubbles are great, but the soft skin is the best reason to buy these for my kids :)</li>
    <li> Produces a lot bubbles without the slipperiness of soap. It also doesn&#x27;t sting the kids&#x27; eyes.</li>
    <li> My kids love the bubbles that these podz create. They aren&#x27;t irritating and are free of allergens. I love that they are easy to use, no mess or spilling.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!!!! My son can finally take a bubble bath!!!!</li>
    <li> Best bubble I ever bought in a long time! It reminds me of good old fashioned bubbles.  Bubbles last longer than many cheap overrated bubbles out there.</li>
    <li> Seem to work great for my 4 year old son&#x27;s light eczema. And he loves to hold them under the faucet and watch them melt into the water. Lots of bubbles for such a small pack too!</li>
    <li> Kids love it. No more excema for my two year old too :) bubbles are quality</li>
    <li> Pods work great for bath bubble time.  It is always comforting to know that with TruKid products you can actually read the ingredients on the back...try doing that with most other types of bath products even Johnson and Johnson.  These bubbles actually do moisturize my sons skin and leave it feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I have finally found the only product on the planet that not only is safe for my sons excruciating eczema, but it has cleared it up in 2 weeks!  We have spent hundreds of dollars and countless sleepless nights searching to find a product that will not damage his skin.  This is it!  I love everything about the product although it is expensive it works!  Immediately after a bath using a bubble pod, I slather our son with organic vitamin e and olive oil.  Wait 5 minutes then apply the trukid eczema cream on top of that.  I apply all day.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> These bubble pods are great! I was happily surprised at the amount of bubbles and how long they lasted! I also love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about his sensitive skin reacting.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The little pods are all stuck together. Packaging not good at all. Tracey Rivera</li>
    <li> Update:   Water pressure makes a huge difference. In the whirlpool bathtub which shoots out water with the force of a fire hose, one pod made copious bubbles. I used them in a smaller tub with much less pressure, and much less violent agitation of the water, and two pods didn&#x27;t create even half as many bubbles. So I think your results are going to be different based on water pressure as well as water hardness. The way I use these is to let the water chew away at the pod while I hold it in the stream, that nets me the most bubbles. If you just drop it in, you won&#x27;t get much.     Leaving at 5 stars due to specialized nature of the product. Relative to traditional bubble bath with lots of surfactants, it would lose 1 to 1.5 stars. The difference between these and traditional products is much more exaggerated at lower levels of water agitation.    Original review:  This really works. I was a little skeptical, but thought to give it a try. One pod made nice bubbles, but since I was filling up a whirlpool tub I used two, and I got a great amount of bubbles.  It did not cloud up the water, and she wasn&#x27;t scratchy after the bath, so I think it&#x27;s a win on that side as well.    You might miss the scent if you&#x27;re used to bubbles having some perfume/odor, but I prefer unscented over bubblegum, watermelon, etc., and she didn&#x27;t miss it.    The hardness of your water will surely make a difference, but here in the east, with medium hardness, they were working fine. A bit expensive, but I&#x27;ll trade that for less scratching.</li>
    <li> Pretty good bubbles with 2 or more pods in softened water. The bubbles do seem to stay around quite a bit longer than others so that&#x27;s nice. My issue with them is the astronomical price-to-use ratio. I am willing to pay more for something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my kids skin and that we can use with every bath (my kids are young). Made in the USA is definitely a plus. But come on! I paid $19 for 24-pods, and you need a minimum of 2, better if you use 3,  to have a good thick bubble layer. Seems they could increase the pod size a bit or relax the price since people on a budget may have kids with skin problems too and they might want to take an awesome bubble bath. But business is business I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&#x3D; years later and my kids STILL love these bubbles. I will say that hardness of water is definitely a factor in the amount of bubbles, but that is just chemistry. I am adding another star because it seems that the price has come down and they now offer bigger bags. We still always use 2 tabs per bath but our water softener has been acting up so that could be the issue. Bubbles, if started at the beginning with a good forceful flow into the bath can easily produce bubble foam that gets higher than the edge of the bath. This ofcourse only stays like that for a few seconds before kids go nuts with bubble fights.</li>
    <li> I am so confused by the positive reviews we tried this 3 times and we didnt even get it to disolve no bubbles no disolve and totally lame!</li>
    <li> Makes good bubbles, but may also make your bathroom smell. Any residue in the tub will start to stink as the organic ingredients rot, so make sure to rinse it away. We had a mystery smell in our bathroom for a long time as we worked our way through this bag. Finally realized it was this product causing the problem.</li>
    <li> Convenient and easy to use. They smell good and my child&#x27;s skin doesn&#x27;t react negatively to it. Bubbles don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I love these bubbles! The little packs produce lots of bubbles and the bubbles last a while, even after my baby has been splashing around in them for a bit. It&#x27;s odorless as well. The fact that it&#x27;s good for eczema is great cause I know it won&#x27;t dry out him skin. The only negative is the price. They&#x27;re a bit expensive. But I guess it&#x27;s ok since it&#x27;s such a good product.</li>
    <li> Kinda expensive, and my kids get over the suds after a couple of pods.</li>
    <li> Best bubbles I have found yet!  They last a long time (still plenty of bubbles after bath is over) and leave my daughters skin nice and smooth and soft!  I use only 1 pod per bath since my daughter sits so close to the drain and does really turn around at all so only uses 1/2 the bathtub.  As she gets older we may need to increase to 2 pods per bath.</li>
    <li> Love these Bubble Podz and all tru-kid products.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gonna look at other items they put out. Only wish it was a lil less $$.</li>
    <li> Nice idea but too expensive. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> These natural bubble podz are wonderful for kids who have dry and/or sensitive skin.  I find that if you put the podz right under the spout when you fill up your tub, it will make a great bubbly bath.  There really isn&#x27;t anything like it.</li>
    <li> We love these bubbles.  My daughter has always struggled with her dry and bumpy skin and also seems to have a rash.  After her first bath with these bubbles she has not a bump or rash to speak of.  The bubbles are big and fluffy and last long after the water has run out of the tub.  I will definitely be buying these again!</li>
    <li> Other reviewers commented that these don&#x27;t make a lot of bubbles. The first time I used this for my son&#x27;s bath I used two pods not expecting a lot. There were tons of bubbles! So the 2nd time I made his bath I only used one and still lots of bubbles. Our water is just right, not hard, not soft. As for these helping his eczema we&#x27;ll have to wait and see as we&#x27;ve only used these twice. I don&#x27;t really expect them to make him better, just not make him worse.</li>
    <li> My girls have eczema so i don&#x27;t ever let them use bubble bath. I bought this for them to put in each of their stockings. This works well for us. They went a little crazy the first time and put several in! First of all these are too expensive to be putting that many in but they also complained that it burned their privates. So now I watch closely and only let them put in two max. Has not caused any issues since then and doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or itchiness!</li>
    <li> Finally my little one can enjoy a bubble bath! AND it heals/prevents his eczema! Thank you TruKids!!</li>
    <li> 3 cubes bubbles well. My daughter has eczema bad and this doesn&#x27;t irritate or make wit worst.</li>
