      <li>Mine looks just like the pic, maybe even better</li>
      <li>This is cute, but it is a bubble gum machine ring.</li>
      <li>A pretty ring, perfect for a young girl.</li>
      <li>I dealt with this company before, and I have receive the items very quickly.</li>
      <li>It looks so cheap, and it was adjustable.</li>
      <li>my niece got me for it then since she liked it so much i had to get the earrings and knecklace to go with it.</li>
      <li>I am giving it to a little girl who would probably love it so if it makes her happy</li>
      <li>BUT NOTHING SPECIAL..</li>
      <li>Love this ring so much</li>
      <li>but I may have just got lucky.</li>

      <li>This looks pretty in the picture but for the price</li>
      <li>Cute, but quality is equal to price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably wear the ring with a match blue top.</li>
      <li>The fact that they were able to help me with my problem instantly, allowed me to realize that I will deal with this company again.</li>
      <li>So if you like big flashy rings this is a great piece to own.</li>
      <li>Picture is very deceiving.  </li>
      <li>CONSIDERING THE PRICE I CAN&#x27;T REALLY COMPLAIN ABPOOT</li>
      <li>I bought the matching necklace and earrings, but wont be wearing the ring much.</li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t even look like real jewelry.  </li>
      <li>the silver is shiny, but the blue gem look very cheap and it has a small hole like those cheap plastic gem for kid&#x27;s crafting.</li>
      <li>even though I love the color I can only wear it on my pinkie and it is a bit big in size for a pinkie ring.</li>
      <li>For the price paid this is a cute little ring.  </li>
      <li>My nine year old daughter absolutely loves it and has asked me to give it to her</li>
      <li>Got three other rings from the same group they were mostly as pictured.</li>
      <li>So, they were extremely professional about helping me out.</li>
      <li>It is so small I can barely fit it on my pinky finger.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my young granddaughter who simply loves it.</li>
      <li>Im sure her dad is so tired of me spoiling them</li>
      <li>But I have small hands so someone with bigger hands won&#x27;t be able to wear this ring on any other finger but their pinky.</li>
      <li>I cant complain much however this ring could be for a little girl for dress up</li>

<li> the gem for the center heart is actually a bead with a hole pierced in it.  </li>
<li> But be careful from reading other reviews</li>
<li> The gems are not glued in center set and the band is paper thin - not thick like the picture.  </li>
<li> I ordered three other items from this company, and didn&#x27;t receive all of my items until November 29, 2013.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve dealt with other companies that either took a week to reply or didn&#x27;t reply at all.</li>
<li> definitely not worth giving as a gift unless it is a gag gift.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s not much special about this ring.</li>
<li> The jewels are glue messy and the band is not solid its adjustable really thin.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a flashy piece not small &amp; delicate.</li>
<li> The ring is sized very small so</li>
<li> The band of the ring is silver and rather thin, and silver.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The picture is very very very tricky. Don&#x27;t buy this. It is a low quality knockoff. Unless you want to have a toy for your doll.</li>
    <li> Love this ring so much my niece got me for it then since she liked it so much i had to get the earrings and knecklace to go with it. I cant wait to see the pics. Im sure her dad is so tired of me spoiling them but i dont care</li>
    <li> This is cute, but it is a bubble gum machine ring. definitely not worth giving as a gift unless it is a gag gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this it looks like a nice ring in the picture but it is a kids ring that you would get in a candy machine. The jewels are glue messy and the band is not solid its adjustable really thin.  I will give it to my niece.  Got three other rings from the same group they were mostly as pictured.</li>
    <li> I bought the matching necklace and earrings, but wont be wearing the ring much. It is so small I can barely fit it on my pinky finger. The silver coating on the ring was also chipped when I received the ring.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S O.K. BUT NOTHING SPECIAL.. LOOKS LIKE CUSTOM JEWELRY. CONSIDERING THE PRICE I CAN&#x27;T REALLY COMPLAIN ABPOOT IT. UP TO YPU</li>
    <li> I got this for someone else but once I seen it I want it! lol It has a shine that I love! Of course we all see the price, its not a $20 ring by no means but its not one of them cheepo adjustable $1 rings either. For the price it was surprisingly nice! If you want something to put in a girls stocking or top her cake with, anything like that, this is your ring. But be careful from reading other reviews it seems this ring changes with each person so you may not get what I got. Mines not adjustable and the jewels are placed perfectly and the Heart SHINES nicely. Mine looks just like the pic, maybe even better but I may have just got lucky. READ ALL THE REVIEWS!!! then make your choice but I myself love what I got! :~)</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t even look like real jewelry.  It looks like a toy for a child to play with, from a doll set.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not how I wanted it but my mom will wear it still it looks more expenses &amp;elegant in pictures</li>
    <li> excellent price but the blue stone had a hole in it . the blue stone is not the same shade of blue as advertised..great for kids but thats about it</li>
    <li> The ring appeared to be as the add showed online...and was worth what I paid for it...was received it in the estimated time allotted...thank you</li>
    <li> I am from Baltimore, MD. I ordered this item on October 3, 2013. And the last estimate shipping day was November 18, 2013. I spoke to the customer service agent, and she told me it was most likely lost in the mail, and she will either provide a refund, or re-send the item.I ordered three other items from this company, and didn&#x27;t receive all of my items until November 29, 2013. I dealt with this company before, and I have receive the items very quickly. The fact that they were able to help me with my problem instantly, allowed me to realize that I will deal with this company again. I&#x27;ve dealt with other companies that either took a week to reply or didn&#x27;t reply at all. So, they were extremely professional about helping me out. By the way, this company is located in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this ring to match, the Heart of the Ocean necklace I bought. There&#x27;s not much special about this ring. The band of the ring is silver and rather thin, and silver. I got what I paid for with this ring. I&#x27;ll probably wear the ring with a match blue top.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this ring. I can wear it on my ring finger. But I have small hands so someone with bigger hands won&#x27;t be able to wear this ring on any other finger but their pinky. It&#x27;s a flashy piece not small &amp; delicate. So if you like big flashy rings this is a great piece to own.</li>
    <li> For the price paid this is a cute little ring.  I bought it for my young granddaughter who simply loves it.</li>
    <li> the silver is shiny, but the blue gem look very cheap and it has a small hole like those cheap plastic gem for kid&#x27;s crafting.</li>
    <li> I love this ring and the family that is selling it sometimes we forget about the people who is trying to make there life better by selling over the internet amazon has been a way for other people to make a liveing god bless the familys who are trying to make there life better</li>
    <li> It is very cute I ordered this with the earrings and the necklace. The ring is sized very small so even though I love the color I can only wear it on my pinkie and it is a bit big in size for a pinkie ring. My nine year old daughter absolutely loves it and has asked me to give it to her, Her birthday is coming up and I am contemplating giving it to her, since her birthday is in December and it was remarkable close in color to the stone she say online for the December birthstone. It is made very cheap looking as the way it is attached to the ring but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This looks pretty in the picture but for the price I cant complain much however this ring could be for a little girl for dress up that&#x27;s all I could think of ,this ring looks like it came out of the gum ball machine very cheap and I personally wouldn&#x27;t wear this I am giving it to a little girl who would probably love it so if it makes her happy I am happy for that very reason.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. It looks so cheap, and it was adjustable. You don&#x27;t find that out until you purchase it and it arrives in the mail.</li>
    <li> Picture is very deceiving.  the gem for the center heart is actually a bead with a hole pierced in it.  The gems are not glued in center set and the band is paper thin - not thick like the picture.  Had planned to give this as a gift - will not be doing so as to not embarass myself or my spouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will not order from this vendor ever again.</li>
    <li> I have a necklace similar to this that my husband bought me years ago, and my niece has been begging for mine ever since she saw it 2 years ago. I purchased this as a birthday gift for her. She loves it very much.</li>
    <li> A pretty ring, perfect for a young girl. Cute, but quality is equal to price. Definitely children&#x27;s jewelry. My 8yo daughter absolutely loves it!</li>
