      <li>&amp;#34;Four more words reguired&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>So glad you can still buy these.</li>
      <li>Consider Sandalwood or Alder as a better smelling/burning incense</li>
      <li>You will LOVE these and the scent more than anything else.</li>
      <li>I love Balsam fir.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got the Fir Balsam and the Pine and love them both for their real-woods fragrance.</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;d better have another holder to use.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t get this incense almost anywhere, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still out there.  </li>
      <li>I HAD to get me some more.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.  </li>
      <li>I will order more.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m do glad for it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite tree as well as smell.</li>
      <li>I was none too pleased with the scent of these so-called balsam sticks, my apt smelled like a pot house, my kids were quick to note.</li>
      <li>To me, those cones smell exactly like the cedar logs that we often burned in our fireplace, as well as the wonderful odor that I used to smell coming from the chimneys of our neighbors, in my old community, whenever I took a walk at night.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast, good price.  </li>
      <li>They bring back so many fond memories and are a great alternative for those of us who no longer have a wood-burning fireplace.</li>
      <li>They also come with a little incense holder in each box that fit the diameter of the incense perfectly!</li>
      <li>Smooth burn with controllable ash.</li>
      <li>More importantly though, I&#x27;m not crazy about this aroma.</li>
      <li>The return process was quick &amp; easy.</li>
      <li>Love the wonderful aroma, but the logs require several attempts to light, then have to be relighted several times in order to stay lit.  </li>
      <li>I got these for my small log cabin incense burner and they work great!</li>
      <li>Still a good smell, and still a solid form - the logs</li>
      <li>I have been buying them for years, and I love them so much that I even burn them throughout the year.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun and unique.</li>
      <li>Still, since the logs smell so great and woodsy, we&#x27;re willing to overlook these minor issues.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful alternative to expensive candles and strong incense.</li>
      <li>These would not stay lit worth a darn.  </li>
      <li>My wife spent more on gas attempting to get these logs for a log cabin we purchased many years ago.</li>
      <li>I have a gas fireplace (I love it) but to get the total aromatic feeling just light up one of these.</li>
      <li>They are by far my favorite incense of all time</li>
      <li>The scent is true to life and smells exactly like a christmas tree.  </li>
      <li>Logs are generally more difficult to light than cones and these are no exception --very challenging to light.</li>
      <li>Priced right.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t get that GREAT Balsam smell, unless you sniff the raw sticks.</li>
      <li>to be fair to this small incense company, give them a try, but be patient in fully light a stick because they tend to go out unless glowing all around and smoking well.</li>
      <li>Be sure to buy it with a holder, since it&#x27;s hard to get the sticks to stand on their own.</li>
      <li>It is greatly appreciated!</li>
      <li>Sent it back to the Mfgr whom I have purchased from before and enjoyed the aroma which is why I ordered this product.</li>
      <li>I was spoiled to another brand that stayed lit from the first.  </li>
      <li>I have tried these a couple times thinking they may have sent old ones, as well as contacted the seller who confirmed what I am saying.</li>
      <li>These will make you want to take many vacations to the mountains, better yet, live in the mountains so that you can smell that scent all year round...</li>
      <li>Once lit, however, these logs burn at a reasonable rate.</li>
      <li>This is the real thing-</li>
      <li>whole hearted 5 of 5 stars.</li>
      <li>It has a basic genuine balsam smell that you can&#x27;t get from an air freshener.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m severely arthritic, so balsam and pine is very helpful for me.</li>
      <li>Smells like a real fire</li>
      <li>much prefer the aroma of [[ASIN:B002670NF2</li>
      <li>Who says your whole house can&#x27;t smell like Christmas tree farts?</li>
      <li>I liked the smell, but she says she is having some trouble keeping the incense lit.</li>
      <li>This particular scent smells like a fireplace during the holidays.</li>
      <li>same brand same scent as 50 years ago with my parents and their parents- love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I liked using these Fir incense refills in my little wooden cabin incense holder.  </li>
      <li>Love the fragrance and the only reason I didn&#x27;t re-order this season is because I remember it sometimes took three tries of lighting each stick, then having them go out, and re-lighting them.  </li>
      <li>We also bought the little log cabin, and keeping the lid off until the smoke is going strong does help a bit.  </li>
      <li>but the scent actually offends so many people, its mistaken for furniture polish or other strange scents, and I do buy high quality</li>
      <li>However, the incense holder is too small to fit the logs in</li>
      <li>Item was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>product a little dry, difficult to set up, light, good seller</li>
      <li>I keep it near me through the winter months and just inhale the scent-it beats lavender or anything you might want to smell for calming and internal warmth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a stronger smelling incense than the Red Cedar that Paine&#x27;s also makes, if you are new to burning incense, perhaps try to the Red Cedar first and then this, or burn this in a larger room as it has a slightly harsher smell.</li>
      <li>They are hard to light at first because they are so thick, but when you get them lit, which you will, they burn completely all of the way down.</li>
      <li>Considering the most negative reviews have been recent, maybe this is just a bad batch, but I don&#x27;t know for sure because I haven&#x27;t purchased this scent before from Paine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> These have been around for a long time, even back to my youth.  </li>
<li> Though they are not perfect, because the cones are attached to each other and have to be broken off, which can be challenging and result in damaged cones, and also because those burn rather quickly, I&#x27;d still recommend buying the Paine&#x27;s red cedar cones over the Paine&#x27;s fir balsam logs.</li>
<li> I tried other brands of wood incense touted to be pure, but its fragrance seemed a little perfumey.  </li>
<li> The incense I received were over 2\\&quot; long, not the shorter ones depicted in the pic&#x27;s on Amazon.</li>
<li> Have had this incence for as long as I can remember.</li>
<li> She loves to burn incense all winter long.  </li>
<li> and I will continue to purchase these as long as they are selling them.</li>
<li> They burn for a very long time too.</li>
<li> I was worried some would arrive broken but to my surprise they all were intact and ready to go!</li>
<li> It does not smell too &#x27;&#x27;incense-like&#x27;&#x27;, and it does not have a fake, sweet type of smell either.</li>

    <li> Best pine scent ever!</li>
    <li> Who says your whole house can&#x27;t smell like Christmas tree farts?</li>
    <li> The logs burn well and smell great.  They last a little less than 10 minutes each.  I use them with the log cabin I purchased from the same company.  However, the incense holder is too small to fit the logs in so you&#x27;d better have another holder to use.</li>
    <li> Purchased product to add an outdoorsy smell of Christmas inside the home.  Works well ... good smell . some difficulty with getting \\&quot;coals\\&quot; going with this type of cone.  Smooth burn with controllable ash.</li>
    <li> I was none too pleased with the scent of these so-called balsam sticks, my apt smelled like a pot house, my kids were quick to note. But it sort of grows on you or your olfactory equipment adjusts and the smell begins to feel woodsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m partial to Kniep&#x27;s Balsam/Pine oil...that&#x27;s an unfair standard to measure any other pine fragrance because Kniep is sheer perfection. I keep it near me through the winter months and just inhale the scent-it beats lavender or anything you might want to smell for calming and internal warmth. I&#x27;m severely arthritic, so balsam and pine is very helpful for me. I would add patchouli as well but the scent actually offends so many people, its mistaken for furniture polish or other strange scents, and I do buy high quality oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to be fair to this small incense company, give them a try, but be patient in fully light a stick because they tend to go out unless glowing all around and smoking well.</li>
    <li> Bought a box years ago at harrows and couldnt find any till now, stuff smells great burns for like 15 minutes and smells for hours.</li>
    <li> The incense I received were over 2\\&quot; long, not the shorter ones depicted in the pic&#x27;s on Amazon. Also the package had 40 sticks instead of the advertised 50...(probably because of the size difference)..even though the receipt said 50.... Anyway my \\&quot;long\\&quot; sticks burn quite a while and give off minimal smoke. They remind me of putting pine cones on a camp fire..smells so good. Like other reveiws the holder hole is too small so just bore it out a tad and you&#x27;re set.</li>
    <li> accidently found this on Amazon. My wife spent more on gas attempting to get these logs for a log cabin we purchased many years ago. She loved the scent and adds to Christmas smells</li>
    <li> Used it for Christmas--enjoyed the fragrance that intermingled with all of the other fragrances that come with Christmas.</li>
    <li> smell good but a pain to keep lit.</li>
    <li> These are a season staple at Christmas for me!  A must have!!</li>
    <li> This product has false advertising from the seller.  The cones do not light up and when they do they are out in a matter of minutes.  The smoke is rather pungent and I would only use it when my windows are open.</li>
    <li> I liked using these Fir incense refills in my little wooden cabin incense holder.  The house smelled nice and the incense smoke look cute coming out of the chimney.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and the only reason I didn&#x27;t re-order this season is because I remember it sometimes took three tries of lighting each stick, then having them go out, and re-lighting them.  I was spoiled to another brand that stayed lit from the first.  Don&#x27;t know the solution to this problem, but will keep looking for balsam log incense before the season&#x27;s over.</li>
    <li> I had trouble getting the incense lit. When I did, I couldn&#x27;t get the burned incense out of the little wood block. Have you tried using one of those blocks? I am very disappointed. Too bad the logs are so hard to light. The smell is great tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Virginia Huskey</li>
    <li> Reminds me of my childhood Christmas holidays of over fifty years ago.  Arrived quickly.  Priced right.  I will order more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best .best price and best smell ever.</li>
    <li> I have bought these same incense from a country store catalog that I used to get in the mail. They had stopped selling them for some reason and I was so bummed out when they discontinued them. I could not believe it when I seen them on here. I HAD to get me some more. They smell just like being up in the Redwoods or the forest. They are by far my favorite incense of all time and I will continue to purchase these as long as they are selling them. These will make you want to take many vacations to the mountains, better yet, live in the mountains so that you can smell that scent all year round... no kidding! They burn for a very long time too. They are hard to light at first because they are so thick, but when you get them lit, which you will, they burn completely all of the way down. There is never any waste at all. They also come with a little incense holder in each box that fit the diameter of the incense perfectly! The best incense that I have EVER purchased and will continue to purchase. You will LOVE these and the scent more than anything else. AWESOME! Thank you for the very fast service too!!! It is greatly appreciated!</li>
    <li> Works great. Smells good.</li>
    <li> So glad you can still buy these. In my family, we burned these every Christmastime. The scent hasn&#x27;t changed a bit and I&#x27;m do glad for it. Smells just like the holidays when I was a kid.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Just like when I was a child.  Always knew when Santa&#x27;s pipe was lite because the fragrance from these cones would remind me of what my parents use to tell us.</li>
    <li> The scent is true to life and smells exactly like a christmas tree.  When my tree no longer gives off scent, I use these</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time for stocking stuffers. Item was exactly what I expected.Missed the scent from childhood.</li>
    <li> I tried other brands of wood incense touted to be pure, but its fragrance seemed a little perfumey.  I&#x27;ve returned to Paine&#x27;s a happier and wiser customer. I&#x27;ve got the Fir Balsam and the Pine and love them both for their real-woods fragrance. They burn hard and last long. If you don&#x27;t already have the burner that comes with the incense, save a couple of headaches and get it.  I&#x27;ve got the little log holders and for years have had the little cabin incense burner. It&#x27;s fun and unique.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product since my childhood Christmas&#x27;s. 50 + yrs. My children also are used to this at their Christmas&#x27;s. Memories....!!!</li>
    <li> Love the wonderful aroma, but the logs require several attempts to light, then have to be relighted several times in order to stay lit.  We also bought the little log cabin, and keeping the lid off until the smoke is going strong does help a bit.  Still, since the logs smell so great and woodsy, we&#x27;re willing to overlook these minor issues.</li>
    <li> I got these for my small log cabin incense burner and they work great! I was worried some would arrive broken but to my surprise they all were intact and ready to go! The box comes with a small wooden burner incase you  do not have a cabin burner, if you don&#x27;t I would get on that right away because they are perfect for the Paine&#x27;s Large Cabin Burner! Great shipping, great quality!</li>
    <li> Wonderful alternative to expensive candles and strong incense. This particular scent smells like a fireplace during the holidays.</li>
    <li> hubby said that I brought him back to his childhood memories</li>
    <li> I love Balsam fir. It&#x27;s my favorite tree as well as smell. But the problem with these incense, is that it&#x27;s litterally just smoke from burning Balsam fir. You don&#x27;t get that GREAT Balsam smell, unless you sniff the raw sticks. I have tried these a couple times thinking they may have sent old ones, as well as contacted the seller who confirmed what I am saying. Consider Sandalwood or Alder as a better smelling/burning incense</li>
    <li> These are just the best selling balsam fir incense products around! I have been buying them for years, and I love them so much that I even burn them throughout the year. It has a basic genuine balsam smell that you can&#x27;t get from an air freshener. It does not smell too &#x27;&#x27;incense-like&#x27;&#x27;, and it does not have a fake, sweet type of smell either. It just reminds you of walking through your neighborhood on a winter day when you can catch the smell of everyone&#x27;s fireplace being used!</li>
    <li> product a little dry, difficult to set up, light, good seller</li>
    <li> This is the real thing- same brand same scent as 50 years ago with my parents and their parents- love this stuff.  Delivered great- no problems</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for several years. Ever since we converted our wood burning to gas, I&#x27;ve missed the wood burning aroma. These do the trick.</li>
    <li> The logs are a nice addition to the home around the holidays but we sometimes have an issue keeping them burning after they are lit.</li>
    <li> I returned these because they didn&#x27;t smell as described. The return process was quick &amp; easy. &amp;#34;Four more words reguired&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mother.  She loves to burn incense all winter long.  These remind her of an open, outdoor fire (contained, of course!)  She&#x27;s very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get this incense almost anywhere, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still out there.  Arrived fast, good price.  Be sure to buy it with a holder, since it&#x27;s hard to get the sticks to stand on their own.</li>
    <li> Have had this incence for as long as I can remember. Reminds me of the holidays. Save great product for decades. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This was bought for my daughter. I liked the smell, but she says she is having some trouble keeping the incense lit.</li>
    <li> Once you get one of these beauties lit up, your instincts tell you to go search for a stick so you can roast a marshmallow... While this incense does not produce any fire or noticeable heat, it does produce the tell tale smell of a campfire, fireplace, or wood stove burning coniferous wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a stronger smelling incense than the Red Cedar that Paine&#x27;s also makes, if you are new to burning incense, perhaps try to the Red Cedar first and then this, or burn this in a larger room as it has a slightly harsher smell. This is the incense that comes with the log cabin burner, and I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try the Pinon Pine incense next as it is the only one I haven&#x27;t tried from Paine&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whole hearted 5 of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Not as fragrant as expected</li>
    <li> Smells like a real fire</li>
    <li> These have been around for a long time, even back to my youth.  Still a good smell, and still a solid form - the logs&lt;br /&gt;do not crumble in your hands when you insert them in the holder.</li>
    <li> Smelled like a pile of burning wet leaves. Sent it back to the Mfgr whom I have purchased from before and enjoyed the aroma which is why I ordered this product. This box smelled nothing like the former supply of Balsam Fir incense I had.</li>
    <li> These would not stay lit worth a darn.  I was disappointed as I hoped I could burn these well in my figurines designed for burning these.  They stopped burning in about 10 minutes.  Wouldnt buy again.</li>
    <li> Logs are generally more difficult to light than cones and these are no exception --very challenging to light. Once lit, however, these logs burn at a reasonable rate. More importantly though, I&#x27;m not crazy about this aroma. Considering the most negative reviews have been recent, maybe this is just a bad batch, but I don&#x27;t know for sure because I haven&#x27;t purchased this scent before from Paine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the aroma of [[ASIN:B002670NF2 50 Paine&#x27;s Red Cedar Cones With Holder - \\&quot;Thrift Box\\&quot;]]. To me, those cones smell exactly like the cedar logs that we often burned in our fireplace, as well as the wonderful odor that I used to smell coming from the chimneys of our neighbors, in my old community, whenever I took a walk at night. They bring back so many fond memories and are a great alternative for those of us who no longer have a wood-burning fireplace. Though they are not perfect, because the cones are attached to each other and have to be broken off, which can be challenging and result in damaged cones, and also because those burn rather quickly, I&#x27;d still recommend buying the Paine&#x27;s red cedar cones over the Paine&#x27;s fir balsam logs.</li>
    <li> I have a gas fireplace (I love it) but to get the total aromatic feeling just light up one of these.</li>
