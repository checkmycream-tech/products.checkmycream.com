      <li>I loved it!  </li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT</li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>Might be good on lips with a lip gloss</li>
      <li>I loved this stuff 25 years ago, and this didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
      <li>Have loved this powder for years and will order a replacement.    </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Have loved the powder for many years.</li>
      <li>So glad to still be able to get it and at a good price.</li>
      <li>The cork isn&#x27;t a good fit and when I remove it, the powder goes everywhere.  </li>
      <li>This is the real deal, and it still works beautifully as a blusher, contour powder, eyeshadow, and even a lip tint.  </li>
      <li>Love it, you need to use soap to wash it off.</li>
      <li>I am so glad to have found it again.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is like magic.  </li>
      <li>USED 4 MANY YEARS.</li>
      <li>The powder inside is more granular and has what looks like hematite ground up.</li>
      <li>it :)</li>
      <li>but I love it.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>It makes me look a bit more tan without giving me that \\&quot;orange glow\\&quot; that most make- up is famous for.</li>
      <li>so glad i found it again .</li>
      <li>easy to apply and blends in without color line on then face.  </li>
      <li>I used this in the seventies and have been fooled before by cheap imitations.  </li>
      <li>great bronzer I have been using it since a teenage , can also be used as a lip color .try</li>
      <li>I still have my original Indian Earth from 1979.</li>
      <li>The powder itself is great; however, when I received it, there was loose powder inside the package.  </li>
      <li>Just love the results and will reorder again when ready.</li>
      <li>My daughter made the mistake of using to much and boy was she dark, lol &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I happened to have an old urn from Rubiglo that the cork is tighter, so I transferred the powder to that urn which is a much better fit.</li>
      <li>The original had more Brown hues and this has Red hues.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent in between filler from using self tanners that eventually build up on knees and ankles, this prduct is a great subtitute,you will need to dilute it with white powder to get a balanced hue,this is a very dark reddish and to dark for my skin initially.</li>
      <li>I will be searching for the true Original Indian Earth, this reminds me of a Loreal product I bought that was a knock off of Indian Earth that was really Red</li>
      <li>My recently large dog ate the cork top and emptied the contents from front to back in our house.  </li>
      <li>The jar is twice as large.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Vendor was fast and proficient.</li>
      <li>thanks again&lt;br</li>
      <li>The order I received was for the smaller jar, and the same kind of puff was included.  </li>
      <li>Not the same as the original Indian Earth</li>
      <li>I used to wear this stuff in High School.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to get it, and then so bummed out when it turned out to be so deep Red.  </li>
      <li>I bought Indian Earth back in the 70&#x27;s when it first came out.</li>
      <li>I do Not believe this to be the Original and true Indian Earth I used back in the late 70&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>You definitely don&#x27;t need much of it.</li>
      <li>D\It doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly and the size of the jar is misleading, there is hardly any product in it.</li>
      <li>Same product from when I was young.  </li>
      <li>the product is as expected and I really like it.</li>

<li> Not sure if the name implies the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; company - or the &amp;#34;the original&amp;#34; formula - since the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; ingredients (back in the early years) were simply called &amp;#34;earth minerals&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> Just a very little bit goes a long way and it looks very natural if not over applied.</li>
<li> That being said, I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to replace it!  </li>
<li> I expect to have this a long time too!  </li>
<li> The problem may be the tiny little puff that they send with it now.  </li>
<li> It was mostly empty and gave me an irritation.</li>
<li> I have used this to mix with other products and I always manage to get what I want.</li>
<li> I was expecting a larger jar and quantity,  expensive for such a small amount</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I have changed or the product has, but it is not like I was years ago.  </li>
<li> Sadly, I broke the pot it came in, long before the product was gone.  </li>
<li> VERY hard to get it on evenly, no matter how little you use.  </li>
<li> I used Indian Earth in the late 70&#x27;s at the suggestion of my cousin.  </li>
<li> Very hard to get on evenly.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed, I bought two and thought they would last forever.</li>

    <li> Use it all the time.  Lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a larger jar and quantity,  expensive for such a small amount</li>
    <li> this is just perfect.  I bought Indian Earth back in the 70&#x27;s when it first came out. it came in a bigger jar and last a year.  it actually last a lot longer.  I expect to have this a long time too!  you don&#x27;t need a lot, just a touch.  perfect!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent in between filler from using self tanners that eventually build up on knees and ankles, this prduct is a great subtitute,you will need to dilute it with white powder to get a balanced hue,this is a very dark reddish and to dark for my skin initially. Love it, you need to use soap to wash it off.</li>
    <li> luv this so glad i found it again . Used it in the 80ies . i&#x27;ll be ordering all indian earth products . thanks again&lt;br /&gt;  Joan Machetto</li>
    <li> My recently large dog ate the cork top and emptied the contents from front to back in our house.  The Indian Earth powder seems to stay put where it&#x27;s sprinkled.  Have loved this powder for years and will order a replacement.    Elaine Palmore</li>
    <li> This is great. I loved this stuff 25 years ago, and this didn&#x27;t disappoint. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Not the same as the original Indian Earth I used back in the 70&#x27;s. D\It doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly and the size of the jar is misleading, there is hardly any product in it.</li>
    <li> USED 4 MANY YEARS. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I have used this to mix with other products and I always manage to get what I want. It stays on well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before and when I received it this time it was totally different. It looked like you took dirt and put it into container. It was mostly empty and gave me an irritation.</li>
    <li> I used Indian Earth in the late 70&#x27;s at the suggestion of my cousin.  I loved it!  And still do.  The order I received was for the smaller jar, and the same kind of puff was included.  Use sparingly!  This one should last me a couple of years!!  I am so glad to have found it again.  Now, can anyone tell me where I can find a cologne called Tweed?</li>
    <li> I do Not believe this to be the Original and true Indian Earth I used back in the late 70&#x27;s.  The original had more Brown hues and this has Red hues.  I am thankful I have two puffs, I use the product sparingly.  I already have a deep tan and this is still too Red to use all over my face, I only use it for my cheek bones and contouring.  I will be searching for the true Original Indian Earth, this reminds me of a Loreal product I bought that was a knock off of Indian Earth that was really Red too.&lt;br /&gt; I was so excited to get it, and then so bummed out when it turned out to be so deep Red.  Might be good on lips with a lip gloss, I will try that next.</li>
    <li> Not sure if the name implies the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; company - or the &amp;#34;the original&amp;#34; formula - since the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; ingredients (back in the early years) were simply called &amp;#34;earth minerals&amp;#34;.  According to the manufacturer,  the current ingredients are as follows: Mica, Zinc, Stearate, Boron Nitrate, Bismuth Oxychloride, octyl palmitate, barbadensis extract, silica, aloe, tcopheryl, ACETATE. May contain C177891, C177491, 77492, C17499, 77742, C175470, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate&amp;#34;. I was told that the different ingredients with the letter &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; in front are iron oxides.</li>
    <li> Thank you! the product is as expected and I really like it.</li>
    <li> just can&#x27;t find it...lost in storage room.</li>
    <li> You definitely don&#x27;t need much of it. Just a very little bit goes a long way and it looks very natural if not over applied. My daughter made the mistake of using to much and boy was she dark, lol &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> easy to apply and blends in without color line on then face.  Also can be used on the nose and forehead to eliminate shine.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to receive this product! Just love the results and will reorder again when ready. Service was excellent! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Have loved the powder for many years. So glad to still be able to get it and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product if you have ever used Indian Earth, you can use it for lips, cheek color and all over face glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor was fast and proficient.</li>
    <li> great bronzer I have been using it since a teenage , can also be used as a lip color .try it :)</li>
    <li> I still have my original Indian Earth from 1979. The jar is twice as large. The powder inside is more granular and has what looks like hematite ground up. I was very disappointed, I bought two and thought they would last forever. It is definitely NOT THE SAME!!!!</li>
    <li> I used to wear this stuff in High School.  Sadly, I broke the pot it came in, long before the product was gone.  That being said, I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to replace it!

    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  smaller and different jar than years ago but I love it.  Same product from when I was young.  Lasts forever too.  Best blush ever.</li>
    <li> I used this in the seventies and have been fooled before by cheap imitations.  This is the real deal, and it still works beautifully as a blusher, contour powder, eyeshadow, and even a lip tint.  Color is perfect for me.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I have changed or the product has, but it is not like I was years ago.  VERY hard to get it on evenly, no matter how little you use.  The problem may be the tiny little puff that they send with it now.  It also caused my face to break out.</li>
    <li> The powder itself is great; however, when I received it, there was loose powder inside the package.  The cork isn&#x27;t a good fit and when I remove it, the powder goes everywhere.  I happened to have an old urn from Rubiglo that the cork is tighter, so I transferred the powder to that urn which is a much better fit.</li>
    <li> Very hard to get on evenly.  I finally just threw it away.</li>
