      <li>Great easy to use toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I immediately went to Amazon (Amazing Amazon), found it and sent her 12 pumps.  </li>
      <li>thine own bud</li>
      <li>thereby beauty&#x27;s rose might never die,&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>This particular style pump is the BEST!  </li>
      <li>its the best i don&#x27;t care what comes out as new products</li>

      <li>and that is very important.</li>
      <li>Thrilled my Mom and since it&#x27;s easy for her arthritic hands to manage.  </li>
      <li>own bright eyes,&lt;br /&gt;Feed&#x27;st thy light&#x27;s flame with self-substantial fuel,&lt;br /&gt;Making a famine where abundance lies,&lt;br /&gt;Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.&lt;br /&gt;Thou</li>
      <li>though most of the cleaning is achieved by the mechanical action of the toothbrush and not by the toothpaste, the toothpaste provides lubrication and good taste to make cleaning more pleasant.</li>
      <li>AquaFresh is one of my favorite flavors of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>So glad I did.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>If you enter \\&quot;price history alert\\&quot; in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.</li>

      <li>So glad I found this.</li>
      <li>Although that is the prime reason I love it</li>
      <li>I never accidentally squeeze out more than I need.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s not my favorite brand</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Why would anyone continue using tube toothpaste when the much easier to use pump is available. Not to mention the mess a tube becomes as it gets used up. No problem with a pump ... it stays clean and easy to use to the last drop.</li>
    <li> I have always used the Aquafresh Pump when I could buy it in the drugstore or Walmart. Now it seems impossible to find it except at Amazon.com. Kudos to Amazon for making it possible to use the Pump once again!</li>
    <li> These are the bottles I remember as a kid, and they get the job done as far as my breath and overall cleaning but my teeth still feel a little gritty after brushing. I love the smooth clean feeling I get after brushing my teeth, and this doesn&#x27;t quite fit the bill in that way.     Still, it comes in a very convenient bottle, cool colors, and tastes great.     Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying these again however, but good as a trip down memory lane!</li>
    <li> I really like using a pump delivery system for my toothpaste.  The main reason is that it generates a lot less mess on the bathroom counter. It delivers just the right amount of toothpaste, does not splatter, there is no overflowing tube and cap that leave little bit of toothpaste on the counter.  This means less clean-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The triple protection AquaFresh is one of my favorite flavors of toothpaste. I like its taste during the brushing and after using it my mouth feels clean because of the minty after flavor. It is not too minty and not too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though most of the cleaning is achieved by the mechanical action of the toothbrush and not by the toothpaste, the toothpaste provides lubrication and good taste to make cleaning more pleasant. This makes people brush longer and that is very important. Aquafresh does a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is good but fluctuates. I find it helpful to look up historical prices in a Amazon price history tool. It allows you to see the prices for the last year and even to generate alert emails when the Amazon price reaches the desired level. If you enter \\&quot;price history alert\\&quot; in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool to be very helpful.</li>
    <li> This is awesome toothpaste, it comes in pumps which is very rare and convenient to use.  Toothpaste not only smells good and it keep your mouth clean and free of gingivitis and prevents cavity and it is 6.4 ounce each bottle for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find these anymore really miss them</li>
    <li> I love the pump style of Aquafresh.  I hope they don&#x27;t plan to discontinue the \\&quot;pump\\&quot;.  I am having a harder time finding it in stores.  Now I have to make my toothpaste \\&quot;pump\\&quot; purchases on-line.  It&#x27;s no big deal, but if the \\&quot;pump\\&quot; style is discontinued, it&#x27;s going get really hard to purchase it, even via the internet.  Keep The Pump Alive!!!!</li>
    <li> Like the convenience of a pump, hubby always forgets to put the cap on the tube.  No fuss, no mess.  Quick delivery, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I feel like when I rate a product and / or a seller as excellent, I am confused as to why I must submit a comment, so I just say lots of things like this. There&#x27;s nothing more to say, this product was as expected, I did not contact the seller, and everything arrived right on time. This is all I have to say. This is all I have to say. This is all I have to say. This is all I have to say.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using 3 bottles of this stuff (half a year) and today I went to a dentist appointment and he asked me if I smoked because how stained my teeth were and I never smoke. Afterwards he proceeded to *bleep* my teeth and gums. Bottom line: doesn&#x27;t whiten teeth.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used AquaFresh in a pump for several years, so we were most disappointed when it was no longer on store shelves.  Then I Googled it and found it on Amazon.   I can order two packs of 6 and get free shipping, as well . Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an issue w/ mess toothpaste tubes in my life. Aquafresh in the pump version helps this problem. I like the taste and it makes me feel like my teeth are clean, but it doesn&#x27;t whiten teeth. I feel like my teeth have stayed, ur off white now for a while. Looking for a different paste but in pump.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding this pump in the stores.  I love the pump rather than the tubes or push bottles.  I know that I can get every little bit out before I have to throw it out. It&#x27;s also good for one hand handling.  I don&#x27;t need both hands to get toothpaste on my tooth brush.  I&#x27;m so glad I found I could get these from Amazon!</li>
    <li> My Mom recently lamented that she could not find AquaFresh in the pump in her local stores anymore.  I immediately went to Amazon (Amazing Amazon), found it and sent her 12 pumps.  Thrilled my Mom and since it&#x27;s easy for her arthritic hands to manage.  Good toothpaste too!!</li>
    <li> We are using AquaFresh for many many years - the best toothpaste. This one is very good - like the design and price was also good.</li>
    <li> this toothpaste is great and stays neat because it is in a pump.It is impossible to find in stores which makes it inconvenient to use but your free shipping makes it worth while every time!</li>
    <li> Love aquafresh and this type of container, yet almost every six pack has at least one pump that does not work. Only remedy I have found is the trash. Other than that, all is great. Great that can buy on subscription basis -- saves even more money.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why I can&#x27;t find this at Target, CVS or Walgreens anymore, so I&#x27;m forced to order it on Amazon. Pump + 3 kids &#x3D; no mess. Nuff said. Oh, and the toothpaste itself is just toothpaste. Nothing special. The five stars are for the design alone.</li>
    <li> This particular style pump is the BEST!  Toothpaste is great tasting too.  Been using this in our house for years.  BUT, it is very hard to find in the stores. Target is the only place I find it.  The last time, I didn&#x27;t.....so......I ordered a case on Amazon.com!  Boy is my family happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using aqua fresh for over ten years. I like it. It doesn&#x27;t give me a bad aftertaste and the price on amazon is pretty good.</li>
    <li> We love the toothpaste in a pump dispenser.  It takes up less space and is easier to use.  Glad we could find it available.[[ASIN:B0009RF95K AquaFresh Fluoride Toothpaste, Triple Protection, 6.4-Ounce Pumps (Pack of 6)]].........and finding it in a multiple pack means we won&#x27;t have to try to find it again for a while.</li>
    <li> I love the design of this toothpaste.  No more toothpaste mess or fuss about a lid.  Whenever I find it in a store which is rare I buy all they have on the shelves.  Now I can get it here whenever I want.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> I love the AquaFresh pump in this flavor.  It&#x27;s very hard to find in stores for some reason.  All they have is the \\&quot;Bubblegum\\&quot; flavor. (Not interested in bubblegum; I will be 60 on May 1rst). Thank you, Amazon, for having what I want.                   Otis Talley</li>
    <li> Aquafresh fluoride toothpast in 6.4 oz pump  was so glad to find it on line since i can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore.  was glad to buy 6 at a time so i won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> This is great paste, not messy as the pump is smooth and clean.  The effective toothpaste tastes great and does a thorough job.</li>
    <li> For some reason this product is hard to find in my area, and it is the flavor I like the most.</li>
    <li> I really like this type of toothpaste container. It&#x27;s not so much the toothpaste as it is the pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> I wonder if the reason these pumps are hard to find in the stores is that the toothpaste companies don&#x27;t like the fact that the pump is so completely efficient in squeezing every last drop of toothpaste out with zero waste?  That means you are buying the product less often because it lasts so long!  I also love the fact that there is no cap to lose and absolutely no mess.  Aquafresh?  Maybe it&#x27;s not my favorite brand but it&#x27;s good enough.  And the pump trumps any other factors.  I will never go back to the tube.</li>
    <li> Especially since I cannot locate this item,on anything resembling it, on store shelves here in Costa Rica. The six-pack packaging will keep me supplied for a time.</li>
    <li> Have used product for years, ever since Crest quit manufacturing an easy to used dispenser.  This product is easy to use and is just what I want.  I can no longer find it in my local supermarkets.  I wonder how long it will still be available.</li>
    <li> I prefer a pump-style toothpaste and this is the only adult product I can find.  It&#x27;s not sold locally in Arizona.  Besides, I love spearmint flavor.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was great. It&#x27;s easy to use and no mess. I used it every 3 times a day. The smell was good and I like it. I recommanded for everyone.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this tooth paste.  Not only for its taste but its ease to sit on the bathroom counter and dispense and never having the squeezed tube look</li>
    <li> Cool Mint is the flavor I haven&#x27;t been able to get for a long time. Is it ever minty, really cleared up my nose when I opened the box, thanks.</li>
    <li> I hope these don&#x27;t get discontinued we love this type of dispenser. The taste is not very strong and it get the jopb done., Thank you aqua fresh!!</li>
    <li> its the best i don&#x27;t care what comes out as new products this one no one can top it of .&lt;br /&gt;and its clean very practicale and so easy to use try it you&#x27;ll like it trust me.</li>
    <li> Bought this toothpaste &amp; after almost 6 weeks later we recv&#x27;d it but it was the wrong product. We recv&#x27;d Aquafresh training toothpaste (for babies) &amp; they were miniature size. I was excited to find this on Amazon b/c its hard to find at stores &amp; we totally got the wrong request. Very disappointed with order!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. I have been trying to find the pump tube in the store for quite a while. After visiting [...] and then being directed to amazon to complete my order I was delighted to find what I was looking for. I&#x27;m now set up for at less 6 months. I will reorder when my supply runs out.</li>
    <li> I tried to order the Aquafresh pump toothpaste on Amazon, only to be advised it won&#x27;t ship to Canada.  I don&#x27;t understand why not as I can order Aquafresh products on Ebay without issue so the actual problem isn&#x27;t  the shipping.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this product at any local stores. It looks great in any bathroom. Easy to use. Very functional. I just hate tubes. They look like you forgot to put them away and you always squeeze out too much. The pump just seems to push out the right amount of paste. And you have to love the colors!</li>
    <li> This pump toothpaste is easy to use with no mess. I buy it by the case so I don&#x27;t run out..</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste.  We are always running out and I often have a hard time finding this size.  Of all the ones I have tried I like the taste of this one the best.  Also, I like to stand my toothpaste up in the cabinet and this works well.</li>
    <li> Hard to find the aquafresh pump. Easy to use. Ordered the 6 pack as I can never find them anywhere else.</li>
    <li> The pump makes teeth brushing a more pleasant experience versus squeezing and rolling up a tube.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I just received my second batch of this toothpaste. I like it, BUT ... I hope the company reads these reviews. The first pump I used from the previous batch didn&#x27;t work. I tried everything and the pump wouldn&#x27;t pump. I couldn&#x27;t break open the tube, so I tossed it. I chalked that one up to bad luck. When I got to the end of my fifth tube (the fourth usable one), I ordered another set of six. I should have waited. The last tube in my previous pack didn&#x27;t work either, and that one is now in the trash. These six-packs are a good deal -- but ONLY if you actually get six tubes. I only got four, and that doesn&#x27;t make them cheap at all. As I said, I like this toothpaste. I was happy to see it on Amazon because it&#x27;s becoming hard to find in the stores. I will report back if I have better luck on the six that came today. Meanwhile, I am furious.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why all toothpastes don&#x27;t have this type of dispenser! The design keeps toothpaste neater than regular tubes, the toothpaste has a great minty flavor, and it certainly accomplishes the clean teeth thing.</li>
    <li> Came when they were supposed to.  Could not find them in any store in St. Louis.  Have been using this toothpaste for years.  I prefer the pump over the tube.</li>
    <li> We cannot find aquafresh in the pump any more where we live. So glad I found this.</li>
    <li> I love this, this is daily regular toothpaste, I have sensitive gums, but I love to use this very gentle toothpaste highly recommendet</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been very difficult finding this stuff in stores anymore. My dad is visually impaired and has a hard time using the regular tube, so this packaging and affordable cost makes this a winner.</li>
    <li> Shaft can you say. Aquafresh is fresh. Clean use. I would recommend using this product. Stay clean and apply perfect amount.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for years, and as many have said, it is hard to find in the stores. Besides liking how it works for teeth cleaning (which is fine), I especially like it for two reasons. First, the pump makes it way more difficult to take too much toothpaste, and easy to just use a little (that&#x27;s all you need anyway). Second, it looks so much nicer on the sink, standing there with the cover on, than an old squished tube of toothpaste with gloppy dried toothpaste around the neck.</li>
    <li> Great easy to use toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this locally any more...TYVM!</li>
    <li> these don&#x27;t come with dispensing instructions, so i guess it should be obvious how to get the flow started.  well, it wasn&#x27;t obvious to me.  took some slapping, tossing, tapping, and lots of pumping, but now it&#x27;s working great.  very economical, neat, no wastage or spillage here.  nice!</li>
    <li> I used Aquafresh when I was a kid, because they had that commercial with the three different colors of toothpaste on a toothbrush and I thought that was so cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought the Aquafresh pump in a long time, but it sure brings back memories.  I like that it stands up, making a smaller footprint on my cluttered sink area.  I like the pump action.  I never accidentally squeeze out more than I need.  I like that the plastic wrap comes off so that I have stripes running down my toothpaste tube and I can see how much is remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a rocket ship in our nation&#x27;s colors.  Who couldn&#x27;t like that?</li>
    <li> This is such a good buy and good toothpaste.  The shelves at Walmart are usually empty so decided to order me a supply online.  So glad I did.  Like this toothpaste and lot and it is less expensive than other brands.  Mostly I like the container a lot!!</li>
    <li> So happy to see this product on Amazon even if I have to buy 6. Don&#x27;t know why the stores don&#x27;t carry. Aquafresh should get their store reps to make room for this easy to use toothpaste pump.</li>
    <li> Ok I have tried a lot of different toothpastes out there from the regular, to this fancy one to hippy products. I like this product its good. Is it the best I&#x27;ve tried? No...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquafresh is still my favorite overall toothpaste manufacturer but this one does not leave my mouth as fresh feeling as some of their other products which is the only reason I docked a star. For the price is should be everybit as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try some of their other products in the tube and compare- this product is good but they make better!</li>
    <li> Great idea for packaging toothpaste - no more hunting for the cap (there is none needed) and it takes up minimal space next to the sink.  Unfortunately, it looks like they may no longer be making this product in this package form factor - if so that is unfortunate.</li>
    <li> Item was as described, good product</li>
    <li> Hard to find in our local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the fact that it is a pump rather than a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshing taste the newer mint flavoring offered by other brands is too strong and burns my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep making this great product in this style dispenser.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for years and I especially like the pump rather than the tube.  It does a good job cleaning your teeth also.</li>
    <li> I get this tooth paste for only one reason. it is easy on my hands. It is also a tad cheaper to get the six pack than to buy individual items in the store.</li>
    <li> Nothing but 5 star ratings, most convenient toothpaste ever, and I think it got discontinued :( I wish they&#x27;d bring it back! Why in the world would they do this to us :(</li>
    <li> This is the best form of toothpaste dispenser.  Although that is the prime reason I love it so much Aquafresh is a fairly good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> The pump is far better than squeezing tubes.  It&#x27;s cleaner, you use less toothpaste, and you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; what&#x27;s left in the tube because nothing is left in the pump.</li>
    <li> The best idea for toothpaste container since forever (or should I say sliced bread?). Yummy as regular Aquafresh but no mess with the tube.&lt;br /&gt;First it disappeared from stores, now &amp;#34;Currently Unavailable&amp;#34; on Amazon. Dear Invisible Hand of Free Market, please bring back this toothpaste before my teeth will fall out! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why kids still get their version (which tastes awfully btw)?</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this toothpaste. Be aware that this original cavity protection and two other kid&#x27;s toothpaste by Aquafresh are the only ones ADA approved. All packaged well.</li>
    <li> Danke Shön.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From fairest creatures we desire increase,&lt;br /&gt;That thereby beauty&#x27;s rose might never die,&lt;br /&gt;But as the riper should by time decease,&lt;br /&gt;His tender heir might bear his memory:&lt;br /&gt;But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,&lt;br /&gt;Feed&#x27;st thy light&#x27;s flame with self-substantial fuel,&lt;br /&gt;Making a famine where abundance lies,&lt;br /&gt;Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.&lt;br /&gt;Thou that art now the world&#x27;s fresh ornament&lt;br /&gt;And only herald to the gaudy spring,&lt;br /&gt;Within thine own bud buriest thy content,&lt;br /&gt;And, tender churl, mak&#x27;st waste in niggarding:&lt;br /&gt;Pity the world, or else this glutton be,&lt;br /&gt;To eat the world&#x27;s due, by the grave and thee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. ...</li>
    <li> not the cleanest delivery - it gets a little gooed up on the tip over a few serves, but no fumbling and squeezing a tube.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that Amazon has this product.  You can find Aquafresh in local grocers and stores only in tubes.  The only pump you can find is children&#x27;s toothpaste.  We love the pump and it is so convienent to have it on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Finally! I found a dispenser-enclosed toothpaste that stays clean at the &amp;#34;valve&amp;#34; on top. And this came in a covey of several (5 or 6?) which puts off another disliked task -- trying to choose something on the DIY-personal hygiene aisle. This one&#x27;s a winner. Oh -- it cleans teeth and freshens mouth just like it says.</li>
    <li> This what I use and when I couldn&#x27;t find the pump dispenser locally I ordered it over the internet.  So of course I give it a good review.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste on the market (with the possible exception of the same product in AquaFresh&#x27;s own \\&quot;tartar control\\&quot;-variety), and in the most convenient dispenser.      I have no idea why it is so hard to find this in stores, but I SERIOUSLY hope and pray that Aquafresh hasn&#x27;t discontinued the pump format.  I assume the problem is instead stores just being too lazy to stock two shapes.  Well, get rid of the tubes, then!  These pumps are far superior.    To summarize:  best product of its kind in the best format.  Win/Win!</li>
    <li> I like how we can buy in bulk!!! The pump is very easy to use!!! And, the toothpaste itself is awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem we have with the bulk is that one of the pumps is defective; we have to push the toothpaste up and out from the bottom. There&#x27;s no way we can return/exchange just one container.....</li>
    <li> So happy to finally find AquaFresh pumps.  Been searching since last winter.  Can&#x27;t find in store anywhere.  Will definately be purchasing more in the future!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand why it is no longer in stores. Retailers don&#x27;t understand if they force customers to go to Amazon for toothpaste they are going to loose more than just their toothpaste business. I buy a lot from Amazon but never pharmacy products. That is now changed.</li>
    <li> The first problem is brushing your teeth. You have to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is footprint. This dispenser takes up far less counter space than a tube laying flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third problem is hygiene. The dispenser doesn&#x27;t accumulate any cast-off water droplets, and it can be operated with a single fingertip without having to pick it up. You don&#x27;t have to wrap your fingers around a tootpaste tube that&#x27;s been sitting on a counter that hasn&#x27;t been washed in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourth problem is trying to squeeze the last bit of toothpaste out. You don&#x27;t have to wind up a tube and try to force the last of the toothpaste to the top. It&#x27;s pumped internally, so it does all of that for you. It also doesn&#x27;t have the forlorn look of a nearly-empty tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that excess toothpaste will sometimes accumulate under the nozzle. To prevent this, keep the toothbrush moving away from the dispenser until after the nozzle is closed. The act of pulling the toothbrush away from the nozzle as it&#x27;s closing will pull away any excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a perfect design for a toothpaste dispenser. They should ALL be like this.</li>
    <li> Great to have the opportity to get the toothpaste that I&#x27;ve been using for countless years, @ a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Make sure you have the storage for the whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;No more messy lids laying around and open tubes squirting everywhere! Super for kids (and husbands!)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, it isn&#x27;t as available in stores as it used to be, but fortunately Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Am a dentist and have been using it for years.  Used to get it through the office at greatly reduced price but still a good buy.</li>
    <li> The mrs prefers it and it was one of those fillin items that will last a while for use. Will buy again</li>
    <li> These became impossible to find in town.  they are very clean easily packed for trips and &amp;#34;good to the last drop&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought it for others. She said it smelled sweet. She likes it, and will buy it again next time.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste; have been using it for ages but can&#x27;t find the pump in the stores anymore, so I get it here.</li>
    <li> My elderly mother always looks for &#x27;PUMPS&#x27; in the store. Needless to say, tubes are in and will be in until the next generation decides pumps are in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I&#x27;m not rating the toothpaste, I&#x27;m rating the packaging. She got used to pumps and this is what she wants. Looked on Amazon and thank God, they had it. So, I buy it. She loves it. Everyone is happy.</li>
    <li> I expected to get 6 old shelf-dated tubes. But the use-by dates are all late in 2015. So I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time but it seems that it has been sitting on a shelf for a long time. Still usable though.</li>
    <li> I like the pump design.  Most companies don&#x27;t have this and I hate rolling a tube to try to get all the toothpaste out,</li>
    <li> Hard to fine toothpaste so had to buy online.  Best tasting, works good, good price.</li>
    <li> This model is convenient but pricey when compared to regular tooth paste tubes.  Other than price no complaints. Previous models used to stuck after 3/4th use. But these ones are so good so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aquafresh since I was a kid. I love that it is not a whitening toothpaste!!!! I&#x27;ve tried those and they make my teeth sensitive. This keeps my breath fresh and my teeth clean without overdoing it. Plus the price is excellent!</li>
    <li> The selling point for this product is the packaging.  The stand up tube fits in out bathroom cabinet perfectly.  Toothpaste is good too though.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this toothpaste in any store. You can only find the bubble gum flavor. This is minty fresh, and the pump is handy. The &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; now in the stores is a horrible foam. This one is great.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to dispense, just push the button and you get toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;2. No loosing the cap: There is technically a cap to the tube but I just throw that out. The dispenser has a cover on it that prevents toothpaste from coming out when not in use and that&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;3. Saves toothpaste: I know that some people use a lot of toothpaste, which isn&#x27;t necessary. This helps to control that as it dispenses the same amount every time.&lt;br /&gt;4. No more squeezing to get that last bit: It will dispense til you&#x27;re out, no more squeezing that tube to get the last bit.&lt;br /&gt;5. Saves space: It stands up, which saves some counter space.&lt;br /&gt;6. Minty: It is very minty and will give your fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price: This is slightly more expensive than the standard toothpaste that you have to squeeze out.&lt;br /&gt;2. Amount dispensed: If you insist on using excessive amounts of toothpaste you will have to dispense it twice or more.</li>
    <li> These are not easy to find in the stores, and I like this product so much I have included it on my list of Amazon recurring deliveries. For those who like to use the last fraction of an ounce of toothpaste out of the classic product, this works as best as you can hope with minimal effort. Also, I like the vertical storage as it is very easy to keep in a bathroom cabinet or on a bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> Was looking for the bubble gum flavored one&#x27;s. These are ok. Does the job. Wife is ok with it for now</li>
