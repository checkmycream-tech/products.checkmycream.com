    <li> Great for men in either formal or informal work environment.</li>
    <li> The product was perfect, I always use it all during occasion , people to include girls noticed the fragrance immediately. Thank you Gap and Amazon, it bring my confidence back.</li>
    <li> 2 days after ordering, realy nice product. The container was different than the one I know but the same perfume is there</li>
    <li> Smell like a man.  Just a couple of pfft&#x27;s a day..</li>
    <li> This was requested by a nephew for a gift and I&#x27;ve ordered twice he loves it so much!  Will most definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Product as described. Delivered on the last day it was expected to arrive. I wish it had arrived on the first or second day it was expected to arrive, because I paid extra for expidited shipping. It was a birthday present for my dad and he loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. He loves the smell (and so do I!). I was hesitant buying any perfume or cologne on the internet as I have too be careful of anything too strong which may trigger my allergies. Have not had any issues with this thankfully though :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great scent! Please keep it in stock!</li>
    <li> Very good atention thank you very much everything was ok</li>
    <li> Not the real one, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent for my husband</li>
    <li> Product is very good!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had or even smelled this since I worked at the Gap in 1997!  Glad to see it&#x27;s still around!</li>
    <li> Just as expected! Love it!</li>
    <li> Everything I was looking for</li>
    <li> I asked for compensation on shipping/handling for ordering Qty 3.  Shipping/Handling 4.49 each ($13.47).  Was told &amp;#34;sure.... $2.&amp;#34;  Although I was purchasing anyway because it was a really good price.... Really? $2.  Not even $1 per bottle.  Must have had to &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; product from the shelf one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry SuperStore..... as I said..... Great Price!  but shipping/handling for buying your &amp;#34;last 3&amp;#34; was disappointing.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this scent.  I have been using Gap Blue for 14 years.  I was upset when they took it off the market.  I am happy that it can be found online.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent: very fresh and light. My boyfriend absolutely loves this cologne, and I must say, it really compliments him nicely.  It&#x27;s a masculine scent without being too overpowering or musky, so it&#x27;s better for those who want to make a more subdued statement. I would definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Yummy! My teenage son&#x27;s favorite! I love it too, and we were pleasantly surprised that Gap had such good colognes.</li>
    <li> A perfect customer experience</li>
    <li> This is the best men&#x27;s cologne ever!!  The scent is very pleasant, not overpowering.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend this product enough - it&#x27;s second to none.</li>
