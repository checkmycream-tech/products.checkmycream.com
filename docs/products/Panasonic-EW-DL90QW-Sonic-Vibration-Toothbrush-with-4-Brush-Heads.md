      <li>Perfect package for teeth.</li>
      <li>Howevef the &amp;#34;giftee&amp;#34; tells me she is very happy with it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, It&#x27;s incredibly overblown prices.</li>
      <li>best quality and great price</li>
      <li>It does a beautiful job on the teeth and makes you feel you just stepped out of the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job of cleaning...</li>
      <li>This is a great tooth brush.</li>
      <li>My hygienist confirms that the toothbrush is doing a good cleaning job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lived for 10 years and I loved it.</li>
      <li>her teeth feel so clean and smooth!!!!</li>
      <li>A shopping experience is very satisfied.</li>
      <li>So far, it is the best of all of the electric toothbrushes I have used.</li>
      <li>Very good toothbrush at a decent price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and sleek, easy to handle and maintain.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love about this Panasonic toothbrush is the 2-minute timer that signals you at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds.  </li>
      <li>Its ok it will do the job</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend 3x on a Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>Before buying this wonderful toothbrush I&#x27;d done a thorough and meticulous research for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Works great, leaves teeth super clean.  </li>
      <li>Glad to find a place for getting more of the toothbrush heads.</li>
      <li>My teeth never felt better.</li>
      <li>I first started using this toothbrush, it made my gums tingle (in a good way).  </li>
      <li>Does an excellent job, charge holds for a long time</li>
      <li>Good, fast charge.</li>

      <li>Thus, allowing them to make huge profits from this turnaround.</li>
      <li>Light weight.  </li>
      <li>On charge all the time of course but worked great till finally gave up.</li>
      <li>Does a great job in cleaning teeth and the size of the brushes makes it easy to get at harder to clean teeth.</li>
      <li>After about 6 months it is still as strong as when I first used it without any buzzing sounds.</li>
      <li>It just cleans so much better than a manual toothbrush and this particular model</li>
      <li>Love new one as well</li>
      <li>My first Panasonic EW 1000 lasted me over 5 years!</li>
      <li>so far the best... if you put a little bit of pressure on it and stops the brush from moving that&#x27;s a downside for me..</li>
      <li>This PANASONIC EW-DL90QW SONIC VIBRATION TOOTHBRUSH leaves my teeth feeling really clean--almost as clean as they feel after I visit my dental hygienist--even though I use the lower-vibration \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting.  </li>
      <li>sonic-care&amp;#34; brush, but the more I deepened into the matter of a subject the more flaws and lemons</li>
      <li>So my second Panasonic seems to be great, no problems of having too much vibrations, splashing or sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>I can even use the replacements brush from the old model and they are cheap.</li>
      <li>like 10 times better than a standard toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It seems to be doing a better job than standard electric--time will tell though.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly as promised.  </li>
      <li>My first electric toothbrush and I like it.</li>
      <li>There is a really good documentary on this subject called &amp;#34;The light bulb conspiracy.</li>
      <li>Presumably the \\&quot;sonic vibration\\&quot; is the reason: this toothbrush replaces a pretty good, but ordinary, electric toothbrush (see the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first sonic vibration toothbrush,and I like it,it makes my teeth very clean,just like wash it in a dental clinic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Secondly, many people complained that after around 12 months of use their beloved &amp;#34;Sonic Care&amp;#34; brush suddenly died.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>is my first electric brush and like other people I wanted to spend my money on a good, high quality one, which would serve me effectively for long long time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second, it really cleans my teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth,</li>
      <li>Really?</li>
      <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>and it gets them much cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>but I would really buy a Philips Sonicare</li>
      <li>I really like this toothbrush, but I wish that is would stop after 2 minutes</li>
      <li>Holds long charge and light weight.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this one now!</li>
      <li>Toothbrush works as well or better than previous Soniccare brush.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand, this model has specialty brush heads available, made of soft silicon, that you can use to stimulate your gums or dislodge plaque that wants to form at the gum line in the spaces between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This model is not as strong in vibration as my previous Sonicares.</li>
      <li>Initially, and it&#x27;s predictable, I wanted to buy a famous &amp;#34;Phillips</li>
      <li>I am neutral on this because I don&#x27;t like to wait those seconds, particularly when I just want to rinse it off under the water by turning it on and off several times.</li>
      <li>know, I would certainly  buy an expensive Sonic care brush, invest my money into it if I were confident that this brush will steadily work for several years.</li>
      <li>and she says she loves it once she got used to using it since she said her teeth were a little sensitive after using it at first!</li>
      <li>This is done to make customers to buy a new product from the same manufacturer.</li>
      <li>The brush is small, so I can get to my back teeth easily</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fifth, I haven&#x27;t heard so far any complaints from customers on its short longevity.</li>
      <li>is much better than other models I&#x27;ve used in the past that made me just go back to manual toothbrush.</li>

    <li> I really like this toothbrush.  The brush is small, so I can get to my back teeth easily and it gets them much cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a  keeper!</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush, but I wish that is would stop after 2 minutes</li>

    <li> Works great, leaves teeth super clean.  Highly recommend it.  Light weight.  Good, fast charge. So far, it is the best of all of the electric toothbrushes I have used.</li>
    <li> best quality and great price</li>
    <li> Before buying this wonderful toothbrush I&#x27;d done a thorough and meticulous research for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first electric brush and like other people I wanted to spend my money on a good, high quality one, which would serve me effectively for long long time. Initially, and it&#x27;s predictable, I wanted to buy a famous &amp;#34;Phillips sonic-care&amp;#34; brush, but the more I deepened into the matter of a subject the more flaws and lemons I discovered.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, It&#x27;s incredibly overblown prices. 150, 200 dollars for an electric toothbrush? Really? Are you Serious?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, many people complained that after around 12 months of use their beloved &amp;#34;Sonic Care&amp;#34; brush suddenly died.&lt;br /&gt; IMHO, this could be due to so-called &amp;#34;Planned Obsolescence&amp;#34; when manufactures deliberately design their products to fail after a certain amount of time. This is done to make customers to buy a new product from the same manufacturer. Thus, allowing them to make huge profits from this turnaround. There is a really good documentary on this subject called &amp;#34;The light bulb conspiracy.Planned obsolescence&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vfbbF3oxf-E&lt;br /&gt; To understand this situation I recommend to watch it.&lt;br /&gt;You know, I would certainly  buy an expensive Sonic care brush, invest my money into it if I were confident that this brush will steadily work for several years. But excuse me, I not ready to spent on this crap 200 bucks every year. This is rip-off. The greediness of manufacturers just sickens me.&lt;br /&gt;So, why I chose Panasonic toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;First of all because of quality. The body is manufactured and assembled in Japan. Period.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it really cleans my teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, If something happens to the battery. You can unscrew your toothbrush and replace it.&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, I haven&#x27;t heard so far any complaints from customers on its short longevity. And I hope mine will serve me fora long time.</li>
    <li> Quality product! Does a great job in cleaning teeth and the size of the brushes makes it easy to get at harder to clean teeth.</li>
    <li> This PANASONIC EW-DL90QW SONIC VIBRATION TOOTHBRUSH leaves my teeth feeling really clean--almost as clean as they feel after I visit my dental hygienist--even though I use the lower-vibration \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting.  My hygienist confirms that the toothbrush is doing a good cleaning job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this toothbrush, it made my gums tingle (in a good way).  Now I don&#x27;t notice the tingling, but what I do notice is that my gums no longer bleed easily--something that has been a lifelong problem.  Presumably the \\&quot;sonic vibration\\&quot; is the reason: this toothbrush replaces a pretty good, but ordinary, electric toothbrush (see the [[ASIN:B000PJA1UK Braun 4729-630 Toothbrush Power Handle 1 Speed]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I absolutely love about this Panasonic toothbrush is the 2-minute timer that signals you at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds.  It gives you the impression that you&#x27;re making progress!  The instructions suggest that you divide your mouth into quadrants, and brush each quadrant for 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main drawbacks are: (1) replacement brush heads are NOT available at local drug or grocery stores, so must be ordered online; and (2) the replacement brush heads are expensive (package of three costs about $18 plus shipping from Panasonic; about $20 plus shipping from Amazon (see [[ASIN:B00APT4RZK Panasonic WEW0927W Replacement Standard Brush Head]])).  On the other hand, this model has specialty brush heads available, made of soft silicon, that you can use to stimulate your gums or dislodge plaque that wants to form at the gum line in the spaces between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single charge runs the toothbrush for about 1 hour.  You can store the toothbrush on the plugged-in charging stand, or simply store it on the unplugged stand, as I do, between charges.  The toothbrush will charge completely if left plugged in overnight (about 12 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my Panasonic EW-DL90QW Sonic Vibration Toothbrush from Woot.</li>
    <li> Its ok it will do the job but I would really buy a Philips Sonicare so far the best... if you put a little bit of pressure on it and stops the brush from moving that&#x27;s a downside for me..</li>
    <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;Charges like it should.&lt;br /&gt;Have had no problems with toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like go to the dentist for a cleaning twice a day. My teeth never felt better. This is a great tooth brush.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush was recieved well Christmas day.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It&#x27;s nice and sleek, easy to handle and maintain. It does a great job of cleaning... like 10 times better than a standard toothbrush. My dentist recommended getting a sonic toothbrush and now I understand why! It just cleans so much better than a manual toothbrush and this particular model is much better than other models I&#x27;ve used in the past that made me just go back to manual toothbrush. I can&#x27;t live without this one now!</li>
    <li> My first Panasonic EW 1000 lasted me over 5 years! On charge all the time of course but worked great till finally gave up. So my second Panasonic seems to be great, no problems of having too much vibrations, splashing or sensitive gums. I can even use the replacements brush from the old model and they are cheap.</li>
    <li> I like the compact brush size.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush at a decent price. Does an excellent job, charge holds for a long time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first sonic vibration toothbrush,and I like it,it makes my teeth very clean,just like wash it in a dental clinic.</li>
    <li> This is a well built and quality toothbrush.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend 3x on a Sonicare.  It seems to be doing a better job than standard electric--time will tell though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 different models of the Sonicare and all of them over about a 1 year time of use had loosening of the coupler that connects to the motor, requiring a warranty exchange. When it loosens, it starts buzzing with any type of motion and over time, the brush tip motion weakens. The coupler must be made out of some type of plastic that wears out over time because the motor always remained strong. Also, I brush with a lot of pivoting motion to brush my gums, roof of mouth and tongue which probably shortened the lifespan of the Sonicare. I wanted to try Panasonic and give it some time and see what would happen. After about 6 months it is still as strong as when I first used it without any buzzing sounds. This model is not as strong in vibration as my previous Sonicares. It came with 4 brush heads so the inevitable replacement is delayed. The buttons are somewhat redundant because I really just need to turn it on or off and do not need an extra button with some extra features with no proven benefits. When the button is pushed, it is not an immediate on, but rather, it gradually gets stronger in vibration over 1-2 seconds. I am neutral on this because I don&#x27;t like to wait those seconds, particularly when I just want to rinse it off under the water by turning it on and off several times. I think this feature is to prevent tooth paste bubbles from splattering all over the place if the brush was off and you turned it on with the brush head out of your mouth. I just wonder if a more expensive model has a stronger vibration.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sonic toothbrushes I have ever used.  It does a beautiful job on the teeth and makes you feel you just stepped out of the dentist&#x27;s office.  It&#x27;s a wonderful bonus with the 4 toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> Everything a toothbrush should be.</li>
