      <li>Works great, super helpful when trying to work in your cleanser :)</li>
      <li>They are very gentle, yet seem to do a great job at cleaning out my pores.</li>
      <li>Really frothed up the cleanser beautifully.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about how well these would work, but I&#x27;m not always keen on using &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; all the time.</li>
      <li>I have washcloths that are better at exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and would buy again.</li>
      <li>I love the way this feels on my face, and it cleans my pores much better than just using my hands to apply the cleanser (plus without the risk of getting oils from hands on my face).  </li>
      <li>If you want something more substantial, shell out the $6 for one from Sephora.</li>
      <li>Its okay, I surely didn&#x27;t receive the mini finger stub</li>
      <li>This silicone brush is more of an applicator.</li>
      <li>These are fabulous for your face and prevent blackheads , or remove them!</li>
      <li>and i love that it doesnt &amp;#34;collect&amp;#34; anything -</li>
      <li>i love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;ill</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the product but</li>
      <li>I have an Olay Cleansing Brush that I use at home and love it.</li>
      <li>love them.</li>
      <li>Within a week or so, her skin texture improve and she said it feels refreshing.</li>
      <li>Really interesting gadget.</li>
      <li>If you have beautiful, unblemished skin and want to keep it that way, perhaps this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much when I got this, but it is literally the best thing ever!</li>
      <li>While it does not look like anything special, I find that the texture is perfect for mildly sensitive skin and the massaging action feels so good.</li>
      <li>goodness they had pictures because the directions were in chinese which i thought was cute great product</li>
      <li>However, I do not think that this product removes blackheads as easily as a clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>so cheaply made, very flimsy, and doesn&#x27;t do a good job at exfoliating at all.</li>
      <li>Not to abrasive and cleans easily.</li>
      <li>but the one thing I don&#x27;t like about is how the suction cup at the end of isn&#x27;t strong.</li>
      <li>tried this right away and immediately saw a difference in my skin, the way it felt nice and clean.</li>
      <li>and I find these to work perfectly, and personally love the small design, accessibility and the control of the motions.</li>
      <li>The directions show to use one pad in each hand, but I am fine with using one.  </li>
      <li>just bc its so easy and accessible.</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t say I am 100% blackhead free, but definitely 95%, you have to put your face right against my nose to see them now, SUPER happy!</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my girl because she was happy to find such an affordable price here.</li>
      <li>flimsy and kinda cheap</li>
      <li>Great facial cleaner.</li>
      <li>If you scrub lightly, you can see it working.</li>
      <li>is a great alternative to using a clarisonic daily.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean off after use too.</li>
      <li>it feels great on my face and definitely makes your face softer.</li>
      <li>It does not feel comfortable and I have to brush it lightly over my skin or</li>
      <li>This is great for massaging your face but really doesn&#x27;t do much for removing blackheads.</li>
      <li>It works great at gently exfoliating your face and it has held up very well.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>I received two of the same size, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to matter, as they&#x27;re already pretty compact and incredibly flexible.</li>
      <li>But I after my first use I love it.</li>
      <li>I had heard about these little cleaners and was happy to find that they work much better than I anticipated.  </li>
      <li>and the little guy is great for those oh-no zit times when you want to rub in an emergency cream without a lot of finger touching.</li>
      <li>Use it to clean my face and makeup brushes.</li>
      <li>It was super cheap</li>
      <li>My skin feels great afterwards too and for this low price, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
      <li>clean and tightened</li>
      <li>more can you ask for really?</li>
      <li>I purchased this face scrubber because I hoped it would be as good as my Buff-Puff, but maybe last longer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And cool thing is that its a device rather than a consumable product, so seems like you buy it once</li>
      <li>Anyways, so far I kind of like this product.  </li>
      <li>It works well with any kind of cleanser and is not as abrasive as some of my old nappy washcloths.</li>
      <li>I wasnt expecting it to be so soft but it is and it feels so nice against my face.</li>
      <li>The tiny bristles do a good job lathering my face wash.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s great and sensitive towards my skin and my sister extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Great for fragile and gentle skin.</li>
      <li>Suction cup is super convenient too.</li>
      <li>a me quote quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received almost 2 weeks before estimated shipping date. Very happy thank you</li>
    <li> Great deal. I have an item very similar to this (exact same shape- like, same mould used, slightly firmer silicone) that I&#x27;ve had for years. I paid $5 for just one, so this was a steal. Gave one to my little sister, who loves it for washing her face, and saved one as a stocking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great alternative to using a clarisonic daily. I use this 12 times a week and just use my clarisonic twice to avoid inflammation. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do very much at all.  I can see where they were going with this but I am just glad I only spend $3 on it!!</li>
    <li> I really like this little brush for my face. I do have a clairisonic brush but when I&#x27;m in a hurry this works great. I ALWAYS remove my makeup, so this just helps remove it without breaking out the clairisonic. Worth the small price.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was skeptical about this product. But, it was long lasting and cheap, so figured I&#x27;d try it out. Really interesting gadget. Its very soft plastic... kind of like those little stretchy koosh balls kids play with. Flat side is covered all over with little nubbins. I used it with my fave facial cleanser, and it turned the whole experience into a mini facial. Really frothed up the cleanser beautifully. Unlike very coarse exfoliators (ie: apricot scrub), it doesn&#x27;t irritate or tear up your skin. Unlike those mini bead exfoliators that you can barely feel, it actually works. I noticed a DRASTIC difference in pore clarity after single use! And cool thing is that its a device rather than a consumable product, so seems like you buy it once and it lasts a good long while. Also comes with a tiny (slightly larger than thumb pad sized) pad, perfect for fitting into weird sized facial areas like the crevices around nose and chin. Just to quantify the effectiveness, I&#x27;d compare a few uses of this thang to those very painful and complex to use pore strips that yank the clogs in pores right out of your face. This is just MUCH more comfortable and much less expensive, not to mention less of a hassle to use. Absolutely worth the $5 price tag.</li>
    <li> flimsy and kinda cheap</li>
    <li> I had heard about these little cleaners and was happy to find that they work much better than I anticipated.  Go ahead &amp; give them a try.  For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This was so pointless. I threw it away 2 seconds after I bought it. If you are going to waste your money, please just send it to me instead.</li>
    <li> The performance is great. If you are an asian female who really looks after her skin...this brush is gentle enough to cleanse the face!! Great designing and material. :)</li>
    <li> Bought this item because I didn&#x27;t want to use microbeads because they are harsh on my skin and i use an oil cleanser, it exfoliates very well without being harsh.</li>
    <li> When I first got these I thought it was absolute junk, before I opened it and tried it of course.  While it does not look like anything special, I find that the texture is perfect for mildly sensitive skin and the massaging action feels so good. I love that the little knob you hold onto is small enough to contour the thing around the jaw line to perform lymphatic drainage. I am an esthetician, most of my clients tell me they use a clarisonic brush, and I must admit that the people who tell me that have clearer skin and smaller pores. However, I am cheap and always looking for natural and affordable solutions to everything. I think that for sensitive skin the clarisonic could be too much and I find these to work perfectly, and personally love the small design, accessibility and the control of the motions. However, I do not think that this product removes blackheads as easily as a clarisonic.  Using a clay mask once a week is one of the best things for that, and refining pores.  For the price, I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I loved this little rubbery pad. It exfoliated my face so well, and made it feel so much cleaner. It&#x27;s an amazing little gadget, which is gentle enough to your skin to use frequently.</li>
    <li> Yes yes and yes. It really does work. Uh, not for me but for someone in the family. Excess sebum can really wreck the pores on your face, they clog and short of extraction, you&#x27;re hosed. this little bugger really does the job, it scraps and cleans. Time of course, it takes time, don&#x27;t expect miracles, just expect better skin in a few weeks. If you use it, good things will come your way...skin wise.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not to abrasive and cleans easily. The suction cup back is very convenient. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT! I was alittle worried that ited be to rough on on my face and irritate it but It doesnt at all! I wasnt expecting it to be so soft but it is and it feels so nice against my face. It gets all the dead skin off and works on my black heads leaveing my face feeling refreshed and softer. I would use it every other day though because sometimes it drys my skin out, other then that its wonderful!</li>
    <li> Feels great.  My son&#x27;s face is clearing up, so I think it&#x27;s helping.</li>
    <li> Long use of this is basically the same as using one of those facial exfoliating tools. It helps clean the skin well for a decent price!</li>
    <li> I am in my late thirties and have somewhat dry skin. I also occasionally have tiny blackheads on my nose. I came across these little things whilst browsing for facial brushes. The reviews were really good, so I decided for less than three bucks I would give them a try. They&#x27;re AWESOME! I used one on my face with a regular facial cleanser and it really did clarify my pores. First use. Perhaps these don&#x27;t clean as deeply as a Biore strip would, but I think with regular use it will eliminate the blackheads all together, without the angry, torn skin. I have moderately sensitive skin and think these would not cause issues if used carefully by those with extremely sensitive skin. They feel really nice, too. No tugging or harsh bristles. I am going to order a round for my mom, sister and stepdaughter -- that&#x27;s how good I think they are! I received two of the same size, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to matter, as they&#x27;re already pretty compact and incredibly flexible. I think the big ones could get anywhere the little one might.</li>
    <li> I use this occasionally with a gel cleanser. It works well to increase the foaming action and adds gentle exfoliantion. It&#x27;s a nice, inexpensive, quirky took to have in my beauty stash.</li>
    <li> It is more than i was expecting, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Affordable keeps my skin soft</li>
    <li> I did not expect to like this as much as I do.  I have sensitive skin, but because I can control how hard I scrub with this tool, it doesn&#x27;t irritate.  It cleans my skin very well and gets into all the pores much better than a regular washcloth.  It is not delicate and with reasonable care it should last a long time.  It rinses clean and sticks to any hard smooth surface so it&#x27;s easy to keep at the ready.  I also like that I can use any cleanser or soap that I want to.  I went back and bought one for my sister and my boyfriend.  I wish I had found this years ago!!</li>
    <li> this product is affordable, works well, and is exactly what we expected. face has cleared up and this product was a part of that</li>
    <li> These are fabulous for your face and prevent blackheads , or remove them!</li>
    <li> i have no idea why i bought this... is crap and if your mind is telling you this thing will work or does work you must be nuts because it does do absolutely nothing.... it only rubs your skin.</li>
    <li> These are small pads, about 2&amp;#34; in length, that help in spreading the cleanser on your face.  They do not remove any thing.  The few blackhead I had are still there after 2 months of continuos use.  If you are looking to slightly increase the effectiveness of you foaming cleanse, these are a good option, but you really should not expect any more than that.</li>
    <li> If I had only noticed these in Hong Kong when I was there; I can only imagine how much they really cost...oh well.&lt;br /&gt;Works pretty well, not rough.</li>
    <li> Perfect sephora &amp;#34;precision pore cleansing pad&amp;#34;  dupe.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product to wash your face with.  I bought it for my daughter who loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought these to help motivate my teenagers into washing their faces more frequently. So far so good, they are seeing a difference in that it&#x27;s helping clear up their faces little by little.</li>
    <li> Got this about a month ago but did not work as expected. Once you put the soap and started scrubbing, it would get very slipper and it  was hard to hold onto it, plus it didn&#x27;t scrub that well. I threw it out after two weeks and the suction thing in the back, yeah that kept falling off my shower wall. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> at this price i wasnt sure if i would get good results...but it works beautifully and you can see changes after a few uses.  helps remove black and white heads easily. make of silicon so doesnt hurt the skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really not useful. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking at the time when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sephora cleansing brush for deep cleansing and this silicone pad is good for everyday use since it isn&#x27;t harsh on your skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived 3 weeks earlier than listed arrival date! This product is small yet effective. It left my sensitive acne prone skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Japan knoww face products, buy it you cant beat its effectiveness for the price</li>
    <li> This little tool is so cute and really does the job, it comes with two silicone pads that are the same size and they really deep clean your face without harboring mildew and bacteria. I noticed a difference in my skin texture after the first use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This scrubbruch is a must have for people with large pores prone to blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not at all abrasive and I use it every day. I&#x27;ve really noticed a that my pores&lt;br /&gt;are clean and tightened</li>
    <li> so soft and yet scrubby - and i love that it doesnt &amp;#34;collect&amp;#34; anything - i just squirt a little facewash on it and rub my face down. i keep it on the shower wall with the little suction cup and find it really helps the whole facewashing thing just bc its so easy and accessible. and the little guy is great for those oh-no zit times when you want to rub in an emergency cream without a lot of finger touching.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much when I got this, but it is literally the best thing ever! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> This cleansing pad doesn&#x27;t really remove blackheads, but it is good for general exfoliation. I now use it as an alternative to apricot scrub since the pads seem to work well with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> other than the fact that it&#x27;s a little too small it feels great on my face and definitely makes your face softer.</li>
    <li> Works well as a scrubber but smaller than expected.  Helps achieve product lather. Not sure if it will work at exfoliating but overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> Helps to really have clean skin.</li>
    <li> tried this right away and immediately saw a difference in my skin, the way it felt nice and clean. thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a tough scrubber, but that&#x27;s not necessary for your face anyway. I especially like the little one for getting the corners of my nose. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great way to wash my face with out being too hard on my skin. helps me feel clean after a long day of heavy makeup.</li>
    <li> junk don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I find this a lot easier to hold than the silicone pads from sephora~ at at a fraction of the price! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great facial cleaner. Easy to clean off after use too.</li>
    <li> thought the product would be stiff bristles instead of soft, later saw it listed as silicone.. works ok, but its hard to use and doesnt clean as deep as i thought it would..</li>
    <li> so cheaply made, very flimsy, and doesn&#x27;t do a good job at exfoliating at all. don&#x27;t buy this, waste of money</li>
    <li> It is soft enough that I don&#x27;t irritate my flaky skin, but exfoliating enough to help buff off the flaky skin! It also seems to be helping clear the clogged pores I have... (I have normal to oily skin with flaky patches and acne.)</li>
    <li> This silicone brush is flimsy, thin and scratches my face.  It does not feel comfortable and I have to brush it lightly over my skin or else it hurts.  I do not recommend.  I have used other brushes scrubbers like this that were better quality and did not hurt my skiin.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at this little gem.  It was super cheap so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It works great at gently exfoliating your face and it has held up very well.  The shipping was very fast all things considered.  I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile (and used it both morning and night) now and it still works as well as the day I got it.  I may order another as a &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Initially, I had received only one of two pieces. I let customer service know about that, and they shipped me the missing piece. I use these when I shower. It&#x27;s ok but not great. Good thing it&#x27;s only $2.</li>
    <li> So I just got the package yesterday, and when I opened it, I got two of the same larger sized brushes.  I&#x27;m fine either way, but I just wanted to mention that, and it&#x27;s the only reason I gave this three stars.&lt;br /&gt;  Anyways, so far I kind of like this product.  It feels very relaxing against my skin, even though I normally have sensitive skin.  I haven&#x27;t been seeing any &#x27;immediate effects&#x27; though, as other people have said. My face feels and looks the same, but I&#x27;ll update if it gets any better.</li>
    <li> Great product. Feels soft on the skin and my face does feel more clean after using it. Suction cup is super convenient too.</li>
    <li> This is great for massaging your face but really doesn&#x27;t do much for removing blackheads. The tiny bristles do a good job lathering my face wash.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really removes blackheads but after using it for a couple of months now, both night and day, my skin does feel softer and my pores do look slightly smaller. As some people have said its like a compact, no electricity required clarisonic.</li>
    <li> This little scrubber is very gentle, yet effective.  You can use it with any soap or cleanser, it will not scratch your skin</li>
    <li> I find it hard to believe that people are complaining that it is &amp;#34;kind of cheap&amp;#34;. Earth to reviewer - these are $1.50 a pop. If you want something more substantial, shell out the $6 for one from Sephora. Otherwise, this is a great cheap exfoliator that I can throw into my travel bag and call it a day!</li>
    <li> Use it to clean my face and makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this little scrubber. My pores looked smaller after just a couple uses and it makes my face feel really clean. I like to use it with an exfoliating scrub.</li>
    <li> There are a million products for your face. Some are good, some are bad, some are expensive, and some are cost effective. These are awesome, they&#x27;re a great, gentle, manual exfoliater. These are soft, easy to clean, and work well. Not to mention they&#x27;re cheap.&lt;br /&gt;What more can you ask for really?</li>
    <li> I have an Olay Cleansing Brush that I use at home and love it. However, when I&#x27;m staying over at my BF&#x27;s or when I travel, the Olay Brush is a bit bulky and the bristles get bent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this as an alternative and it works just as well, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting disfigured since it&#x27;s so malleable. My skin feels great afterwards too and for this low price, it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the smaller 2nd piece though as I feel the first bigger piece cleans around the nose just as well (which is what the 2nd smaller piece is for)</li>
    <li> Looking for a silicone brush for my face.  Tried this and found it small (hard to hold) and not very effective</li>
    <li> massages skin very nicely and is easily cleaned :)</li>
    <li> I use these in combination with a face cleanser. Done this for years and it always feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> i find the big one hard to hold onto when it has soap on it. the large one is about 2&amp;#34; across, the small one is about the size of a nickel. and i don&#x27;t know how or when i&#x27;d use it. the pad has little nubs along with a scrubber, and i don&#x27;t know what the nub half is for. i like this thing because it&#x27;s flexible and gentle. but it&#x27;s hard to hold when wet. the end has a suction cup so you can stick it to things if you want.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this little pad, but was pleasantly surprised.  When I use it to apply my face wash in the shower, my face comes out feeling cleaner and looking less dull.  It really hasn&#x27;t made a difference in the blackheads, but is a nice little all over mini exfoliator tool.</li>
    <li> my daughter is breaking out and she uses this the brissels are soft and tiny they really do clean your face from all the make up and grease thank goodness they had pictures because the directions were in chinese which i thought was cute great product</li>
    <li> This silicone brush is more of an applicator. The nubs barely brush although this is better than hand applying facial cleanser</li>
    <li> This works really well but the one thing I don&#x27;t like about is how the suction cup at the end of isn&#x27;t strong. It keeps falling off my mirror. Other than that, definitely recommended as a gentle exfoliater</li>
    <li> I really like this scrubber, during the usage its not rough at all nice and soft. But good enough to get the dead skin off and leave a fresh clean feeling. Although, it doesn&#x27;t get the pealing skin off my nose, I think I&#x27;ll have to continue looking for another tool to do that job. But it&#x27;s great and sensitive towards my skin and my sister extremely sensitive skin. It also comes in a pack of two, so one for me and one for my sister, great price too!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about how well these would work, but I&#x27;m not always keen on using &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; all the time. I like the &amp;#34;non-chemical&amp;#34; solution provided with these pads.  I found that they are wonderful!  Every morning and evening I get a mini-facial with these.  They are flexible enough to get in the nooks and cranies (i.e. around the nose crease).  They are very gentle, yet seem to do a great job at cleaning out my pores. The directions show to use one pad in each hand, but I am fine with using one.  So I keep one by my sink and one in my shower.</li>
    <li> i love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;ill be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;its soft and it WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;and it stays on my shower wall with the suction cup thing on the back.</li>
    <li> If you have beautiful, unblemished skin and want to keep it that way, perhaps this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, however, you have less than perfect skin and have been using a Buff-Puff/loofa (or similar) product for years this face scrubber will disappoint. I purchased this face scrubber because I hoped it would be as good as my Buff-Puff, but maybe last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this facial cleaning pad is far too soft to be effective. I have washcloths that are better at exfoliating.  Maybe this would be good for children?&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the price was low, so I just threw both of them away. Don&#x27;t know if you don&#x27;t try it...</li>
    <li> I ordered this scrubber over a month ago but wanted to test it out to see if it really worked or not before posting a review. I am happy to say that not only does it help with skin care, it feels wonderful! I have noticed that after using this scrubber with a facial exfoliate, my blackheads have reduced in number and even my acne has lessened. The delicate bristles on the pad help with applying the facial cleanser deeper into the pores, thus providing more help with cleaning. I have just recently switched to Loreal&#x27;s Go 360 Clean and so far, coupled with the scrubber, my face is clearing up. I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my girl because she was happy to find such an affordable price here. When she got the order, she was a little disappointed to find only one piece not two like it said on here but she said one will make up for it. Within a week or so, her skin texture improve and she said it feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about two months now. They work well for taking makeup off and exfoliating. Took a while to get it but you can&#x27;t beat the price. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Cleansing Pad for a little less than a week and I am super happy about the results! The first night I used it, I immediately noticed the difference. My skin felt smooth and clean. I use this pad twice daily and each day I&#x27;m noticing clearer skin, fewer blackheads and my face feels incredibly soft and smooth! I&#x27;m in love, especially for the price! You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product but the tío peine part is a total lie! I was expecting 2 pieces as is stated but it only came with one piece, the big one. I was very dissapointed and feel like I was cheated out of my money :(</li>
    <li> works well second time buying it&lt;br /&gt;but didnt come with the little scrub&lt;br /&gt;kinda sad&lt;br /&gt;oh well&lt;br /&gt;helps with cleaning face</li>
    <li> love them. perfect size, and they let my skin feel soft, clean and fresh I use the Neutrogena Cleanser</li>
    <li> Its okay, I surely didn&#x27;t receive the mini finger stub so 1 star it is</li>
    <li> Wow this thing really really took pore cleaning to the next level, even though I don&#x27;t have large pores, but i do have blackhead problem around my nose area, I already use a daily BHA liquid and retinol to clear out pores, but this thing just took it to the next level, I can&#x27;t say I am 100% blackhead free, but definitely 95%, you have to put your face right against my nose to see them now, SUPER happy! however the suction cup thing on the back doesn&#x27;t hold, i tried sticking them on shower wall, but they just fall right down after a couple of hours, but thats not a big deal, also I received 2 large piece instead of 1 large and 1 small, but then they work the same so i don&#x27;t mind. For the price this is probably the best cleansing product you can get.</li>
    <li> It scrubs the face really well, it isn&#x27;t rough at all. It is small enough with the little handle. Way better than just using your hands and much smaller than using a wash cloth. Also it is in purple so that is a personal huge plus for me</li>
    <li> Works great, super helpful when trying to work in your cleanser :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it work. But I after my first use I love it. The bad thing is it is out of stock now. So I ordered the pink color buy price is little more than before hope they are the same quality.</li>
    <li> I love using this product it works great. I apply Acne facial wash to it and then scrub my face with is and it works great!</li>
    <li> I use this regularly. It works well with any kind of cleanser and is not as abrasive as some of my old nappy washcloths.</li>
    <li> This is not an amazing product, that is I don&#x27;t feel like my skin completely exfoliates when using this, but it still makes it more fun to wash my face and that goes a long way. Great for fragile and gentle skin.</li>
    <li> This thing works wonders! I&#x27;ve been searching for years for something that gets rid of the blackheads on my nose! If you scrub lightly, you can see it working. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> When I ordered these I was looking for a sweet and simple face pad to exfoliate with. I have sensitive skin and the sonic face products are too harsh. I can not use a wash cloth those irritate too much and my hands don&#x27;t do anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I was not expecting much however it c a me quote quickly. My arrival dates are not for another week expanding into end of December. That is a plus. The real plus is it actually is perfect for what I was looking for. It is not harsh at all nor is it pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am putting in a order for my supply box, I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> After using these a few months I love them. I often only use one at a time. I use with both my daily face wash as well as with exfoliating scrubs.</li>
    <li> Only give it 4 because it took a long time to get here other than that the product is good. I&#x27;d buy again</li>
    <li> I love the new Loreal go 360 Clean products mainly for what they call the scrublet that is attached.  It is my favorite tool for washing my face, however I want to change to a new before I get through an entire bottle of their cleanser, and Loreal does not currently offer the scrublet for sale alone (I have called their customer service to ask/request they start).  This product seems to be the same thing as their scrublet in Asian packaging - the 2nd piece is a much smaller pad that you can use specifically for smaller areas like the side of your nose.  I love the way this feels on my face, and it cleans my pores much better than just using my hands to apply the cleanser (plus without the risk of getting oils from hands on my face).  The seller I purchased from was uxcell, and I was very happy with the transaction.</li>
    <li> The tiny pad is great for cleaning the sides of your nose and your upper lip, and the large pad for the rest of your face as well as your neck. The little nodules are very stimulating, but also relaxing at the same time. I like it!</li>
    <li> These work great, first time you use it your face feels so smooth</li>
