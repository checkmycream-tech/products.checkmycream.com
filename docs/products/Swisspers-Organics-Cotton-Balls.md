<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife uses these for makeup removal and she says they work just fine!</li>
    <li> I use this to seal the top of Spirulina bottles while allowing air tubes in and it works great at preventing contamination. I haven&#x27;t had any problems originating from the cotton so there obviously aren&#x27;t any hard chemicals or contaminants to worry about within the material</li>
    <li> Nice clean product. Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> These cotton balls are soft and organic, great for any number of uses, and a good value.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect cotton for wick building!!&lt;br /&gt;USVAPORLABZ/SMASHINVAPES.COM - Coming soon!!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else for vaping.</li>
    <li> Have no off flavor, and while they are less thick then other organic cotton balls I have received, I like these thinner ones better because they are easier to roll into a wick instead of having to tear them into the perfect diameter, and they&#x27;re still super fluffy. When I say less thick I mean once you unwind them, they are just as thick, they are just rolled around into a ball more times, this works better!</li>
    <li> Really love using organic cotton as wicks for vaping! Works like a charm, holds a lot of flavor, and it&#x27;s cheap! Loved the 3 pack deal because this will last me a long time! I recommend this to all vapers to try!</li>
    <li> These cotton balls are nicely oversized and soft. A million times better than CVS brand ones. Very fluffy.</li>
    <li> Wayyy less quantity than I was expecting, because they&#x27;re so tiny!  But the quality is very nice.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft and very absorbent. Great to have around in 3 pack. No worries about running out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Cotton, is really good, organic so no fear of weird chemicals or dyes.  Used for creating coils for ecigs.  Great alternative to silica wire. And with the amount...  you probably are ok for like a year</li>
    <li> Enough organic cotton for wicking to last me a whole year or more ! MA. Good product.  Good deal. Yessir.</li>
    <li> I am trying to go organic as much as possible. These cotton balls are nicely sized and pretty and white.  What more could one want?</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast thanks to Amazon Prime.  Great for Vapers.  Does not have any bad taste or scratches to the throat when used as wick for an E-Cigarette.  Highly recommend.  Price was good too!</li>
    <li> I use cotton balls to remove my eye makeup and although I like the softness of these cotton balls, I would have preferred them to be a little larger in size.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely fantastic for building wicks on atomizers. One bag of this stuff is going to last me until the end of time, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife got the benefit of getting the extra bag I realized I didn&#x27;t need, and she loves them for all of her stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m using the cotton as wicking material for vaping, or e-cigarette.  All of the cotton is very consistent.  Packaging was sufficient and clean and delivery on-time.  10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> Research &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Cotton&amp;#34; balls.</li>
    <li> I used these before, and really like the way they hold a liquid. I use them for nail polish remover and makeup remover and I feel they last longer using cotton balls. And, of course, everything is better organic.</li>
    <li> Nice soft cottonballs</li>
    <li> Very soft!! Highly recommend. I would purchase these again especially since they are organic and are better to use:) thanks!</li>
    <li> ridiculously soft - i was skeptical on how soft these would actually be based on some of the reviews raving about these cotton balls, but once you use them on your face it&#x27;s actually quite shocking how soft they really are compared to the basic ones you&#x27;d normally buy. will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> While they are extremely soft, they tend to fall apart very easily, especially when exposed to any liquids. If you&#x27;re looking for a good facial cotton, this is not your best bet.</li>
    <li> These organic cotton balls are gentle on delicate skin. I use them frequently to clean my newborn&#x27;s delicate face.</li>
    <li> Top quality non GMO cotton balls. You can not find anything better than that.</li>
    <li> The organic balls are the perfect size and texture for my purposes. They arrived quickly and are packed in three separate bags with resealable tops, which is convenient. Good buy.</li>
    <li> no boiling required! these are the best for rebuildable atomizers, give the cleanest taste and fluffiest vapor! plus will last you forever!</li>
    <li> Use this on my cats.  Very soft and gentle on eyes.</li>
    <li> The description says that the product is organic but it is clearly printed in the back that it is bleached with hydrogen peroxide.</li>
    <li> These are nice and soft and I like knowing that their organic</li>
    <li> good, soft, as expected.</li>
    <li> Love these cotton balls, love that they&#x27;re organic. Getting four starts because I wish the manufacturer would actually make &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; sized cotton balls. These are not jumbo, even though they&#x27;re labeled as such. They&#x27;re just normal size.</li>
    <li> I was worried about ordering cotton balls online because some brands tend to mesh together and shed a lot. These keep their individual shape and are the perfect size for makeup remover and toner. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> They are the absolutely softest cotton balls I have ever touched.  As an added plus, they are organic and thoughtfully packaged.</li>
    <li> I would have preferred an all natural cotton. not cotton bleached, or whitened with hydrogen peroxide. so much for ORGANIC when it was treated with those chemicals.</li>
    <li> If you are using a rebuildable dripping atomizer, these cotton balls are perfect, just don&#x27;t forget to boil them they have hydrogen peroxide in them!</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but using one ball per day, it&#x27;s worth it! Gentle for everyday eye make-up removal. With lots of skin issues (eczema) including eye itchiness, this is a winner for my sensitive skin. (Yeah, I just can&#x27;t stop wearing my &amp;#34;made for sensitive skin&amp;#34; eye make-up.) Small bag with zip top closure, puffy and soft. Came in a bag of three bags of 80. I&#x27;d recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> These cotton balls are great. Does not feel like the ordinary cotton balls you might normally buy. It does have a different feel and does the job. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Seems a little funny to do a cottonball review, but I use cottonballs with toner on my face twice a day and wanted organic cotton.  Love these!</li>
    <li> These cotton balls are really soft smooth and silky. Love them. Woudn&#x27;t go back to store brand fake cotton dyed ones. Really great product and worth waiting for. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this since all the CVS locally are always out of stock.  I think these are definitely worth it.  Soft and easy to tear apart.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for the price, and go the job done.  I used these cotton balls for removing eye makeup and applying skin toner.</li>
    <li> Wow these cotton balls are SOFT!! I could immediately tell the difference between these amazing ones and previous cotton balls I&#x27;ve used. I use them with a facial toner and, even though they are so gentle, they still get those last bits of dirt and debris off your face and neck without pulling, tugging, or damage. I will be continuing to buy these again and again.</li>
    <li> Got these for wicking my coils to vape with, they work amazingly well and you get so many of them they are probably going to last me a year. Well except for the fact that I&#x27;ve also started using them for cleaning and makeup applications and removal.</li>
    <li> These cotton balls are astoundingly amazing.  What a deal!  I am able to sleep without worry knowing I picked these balls up.</li>
    <li> So for this review I have to say I love the product. As I am a man&lt;br /&gt;do not use this for make up and that jazz I solely bought it to use for&lt;br /&gt;my rebuildable atomizer. I can sincerely taste the difference in&lt;br /&gt;my flavors by using the organic as opposed to the stuff from&lt;br /&gt;WalMart. Keep it up guys I will continue to buy this product&lt;br /&gt;as long as it stays legitimately organic.</li>
    <li> Works well for atomizer and rba wicks, of course after boiling a few times to remove the hydrogen peroxide. Bought the 3 pack, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> These are exactly as described. Not too dense, not too springy.  Nice medium size to fit in hand nicely. There&#x27;s no adjustment needed for me, just use &amp; go. I have sensitive skin &amp; no problem.</li>
    <li> They are a little small, but that just means I had to thin them out less for wicking. All in all, good cotton balls.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t now cottonballs enough to tell whether these are good or bad. I use them to wipe off makeup and it works.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these cotton balls. They are soft and happy to say they are organic. They do their job very well and I will order these cotton balls again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for wicking material in my micro coils after watching a YouTube video. It works / tastes great and is such a great value!</li>
    <li> Are fantastic quality and just what we were seeking.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very soft and my baby loves it.</li>
    <li> I found these cotton balls to be both soft and substantial.  I actually looked up the &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; of organic cotton.  With cotton balls I want to use near my eyes and those I love, I would recommend them.  The packaging is a plus with separate zip-locked bags.</li>
    <li> Product is fine.  I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to the quantity.  I was thinking it was 240 balls per bag.  These bags are very small.  Better price on another site.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for a preschool bean growing project.  I figured organic would be best for the plants (keep those other chemicals away).  They are soft and hold their shape, so I want to buy more to use on my face.  I usually buy whatever cotton ball is at the pharmacy.  I use one a day on my acne prone face.  I&#x27;d love to see how much better these are.</li>
    <li> They work well, though I would have preferred a larger cotton ball.  These are rather tiny and I have to use four of them squished together to clean out my dogs ears.  I do appreciate an organic option that isn&#x27;t laden with chemicals.</li>
    <li> Every time I use these I think - these have to be the best cotton balls ever.  Very smooth and soft and when I use them after applying lotion to my face - I don&#x27;t end up with fuzz balls stuck and tickling my entire face.</li>
