<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> in just three days, i can tell this is more durable and strengthening than anything i&#x27;ve ever used. my nail have 3 coats of polish and they are so strong! this is so worth $8!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this item from a co-worker who swore her nails were stronger and longer after she began using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL be ordering additional supplies from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My nails have always had ridges and have been weakened by the elements, dishwashing as well as frequent hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I attempt to apply polishes they do not apply smoothly leaving a smudgy pale look.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to apply this product with a thin coat of clear OPI polish on top, and guess what!&lt;br /&gt;My nails look clean, polished and are indeed stronger than before.  They have actually grown beyond my fingertips for the first time since forever!&lt;br /&gt;I still struggle with dry cuticles (another story) but overall I am impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I had NO complications burning etc, as other users but I have never used acrylic nails etc.&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try, for the price I am very happy, still working on my dry cuticles!&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have a solution for them...</li>
    <li> Really helps to heal your nails! My professional manicurist also uses this! I brought it with me, to have her put it on, and she already had a bottle...that was very impressive!</li>
    <li> Really works&lt;br /&gt;Make your nail strong</li>
    <li> Truly strengthens my brittle, cracking nails (from winter weather and overdoing gel manicures).  I use it as a base and as a topcoat. On my third bottle, nothing beats it.</li>
    <li> This works...my nails strongest they&#x27;ve ever been!!</li>
    <li> Duri is an excellent nail product. It hardens and promotes growth very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use and order this product. I had originally found it at a retail full service salon..tried it and LOVE</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I have never had nice long nails, but this product has helped somewhat.  My nails seems stronger, and they are actually growing faster than normal.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Best product I&#x27;ve used &amp; has improved my nails.&lt;br /&gt;It really is above my expectations.  I would refer it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Duri Nail Growth and it is not the same product I purchased from my local salon.  First of all, the original bottle is much thicker and actually made my nails stronger.  This product is no different than the $1.00 bottle of nail polish.  Will not purchase from this seller again!!!</li>
    <li> My nails have never in my life been as strong and healthy as since I started using Rejuvacote.  It is a truly marvelous product which does the job perfectly and I would strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome , works like it says it does , my nails were splitting and tearing , no longer ! They are growing and stronger than ever , buy this product ,works great</li>
    <li> It help keep my nails hard, but it peels/ chips after hands have been in water. I would recommend it for harden yours nails.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it truly feels like my nails are stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Directions Say:&lt;br /&gt;Begin with clean dry nails.&lt;br /&gt;Apply one cote of Rejuvacote as a base cote.&lt;br /&gt;Apply nail color if desired.&lt;br /&gt;Apply Rejuvacote as top cote, daily.&lt;br /&gt;After 7 days, remove with polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;As your nails improve, apply every other day or as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t apply the nail polish every single day. I bet if I did follow the directions that it would work a million times better. I still really like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside:&lt;br /&gt;Every once in a while the product will burn. If you have cuts around your nail, be careful that the polish does not ever it! That will burn like crazy! It does go away after a little bit. Don&#x27;t let this deter you from buying the product. After the bottle gets really low, the product gets thick and a tad hard to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying this product! It works great.</li>
    <li> THE best nail system !</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used for splitting, dry nails.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It shipped very quickly and was a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buty this product again.</li>
    <li> This product has made my nails healthier than they were for years. I would recommend it for everyone!</li>
    <li> My nails have never looked better.</li>
    <li> It works if you are patient with it.  Nothing happens overnight</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  My nails have been weakened by Hashimoto&#x27;s Thyroid condition and years and years of wearing acrylic and gel nails.  The natural nails were as thin as paper and peeled and chipped for no reason.  The Duricoat immediately stopped the peeling and the nails seem to be growing in without ridges.  Much better results than with other similar products.</li>
    <li> This product works right away, as long as you use it daily.  Made my nails stronger right away.  I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> it worked for a while, but I am no longer seeing the results that I first had.</li>
    <li> My nails have never, never been better.  A friend recommended Rejuvacote and I tried it. After about a month, my peeling, splitting and generally miserable nails are beautiful.  The only problem is that it does wear off quickly if you only have one coat on.  If you&#x27;re still using it every day that&#x27;s not a problem; you just add another layer.</li>
    <li> Works far better than I expected!</li>
    <li> My  nails are stronger and longer than ever. This is my second bottle.  I love this product. I use for bottom and top coat.</li>
    <li> I have very weak nails and have never been able to grow them at all.  This product has changed that.  Now it is not a miracle cure, and my nails still end up breaking once they get past a certain point - BUT that &amp;#34;point&amp;#34; has been doubled from using this product regularly.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 3 weeks, it is helping already.  My nails are in pretty bad shape, so seeing some of them grow for the first time in years is a miracle. I plan on using up the whole bottle as directed and am praying I will have continued results.  Thanks for getting the product to me so quickly!</li>
    <li> This item sells in beauty salons because women have their fake nails removed and there sometimes is damage. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It gives nails a nice shine. I love it. You put it on as a base coat, then you can use color, then every day for a week add a coat. You&#x27;ll see the difference, if not in one week, definitely in two. Many women use this. It&#x27;s very popular.</li>
    <li> I love love love this polish. I use it as my base coat exclusively and put on a layer of top coat as well. My nails have grown so much over the few months I am soooo happy!!</li>
    <li> this is the best on the market.  Bought it for a friend who now says her nails are like talons.</li>
    <li> I apply this once a day for a few days, then about a week later, I take it off and start again.  My nails look amazing- I&#x27;ve been using this for yearsz</li>
    <li> I have never had long nails. I&#x27;ve always had issues with breakage and splitting and just all around weak nails. I have tried every kind of strengthener and vitamin possible. I purchased the Duri Rejuvacote a month or so ago. I am so amazed by the results. I read all the fabulous reviews on here beforehand but was still skeptical because I&#x27;ve never been able to grow the nails I wanted. For the first time in my life I have long nails. No splitting or breaking. And I started to notice results about a week after I started using the product. It is seriously amazing and I will recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I recently had artificial nails removed after wearing them for three years.  My nail tech sold me a bottle of this for $20.00 at the salon YIKES!!!  BUT, it worked so well I looked for it online and bought two bottlws.  It is the best product for hardening nails I have ever found.  In the past, my thumb nails would always get a crack way down on the side of the nail, it would grow out but by then have another crack below.  This has not happened with the Rejuvacote even though my nails are totally thin from the artificials.  You do have to put on a coat every day and remove everything once a  week  but it is not time consuming and dries relatively fast.  I usually put on a coat while I&#x27;m watching the evening news and it&#x27;s dry in an hour.  I intend to order more as soon as I need it.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has weak or brittle nails.</li>
    <li> I have never had fingernails before and now I even get compliments on them.  I am 66 years old and for the first time in my life my nails are pretty.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be amazing. Until i applied it onto my nails and it BURNS, i dont know why but it does. It feels like my fingernails are on fire! Do not waste money on this product.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to this product about a month ago, and I started using it right away. Now I have ten perfect nails. Before using rejuvacote my nails were weak and they would break easily, espeically if I had an upcoming event to attend. I am very pleased with this product and I have recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> best thing to use after wearing fake nails. when I use it daily I see my nails get stronger and longer in a much shorter amount of time</li>
    <li> This product did an amazing job of restoring deteriorating nails. Results were evident withib the first 2 weeks. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this alone and with the Ice Roses Pinky color. What impressed me is that the deep vertical ridges I have on my nails are barely noticeable with 2 coats. My nails have become harder (amazing). The color is a barely there flush of pink, making the nails look healthy. My only complaint is that it tends to wear off at the tips.</li>
    <li> Actually made my nails more susceptible to peeling and chipping.  No protection was noted at all.  I use another product (that&#x27;s quite pricey) that gives a nice pink and healthy appeararance to my nails.  Rejuvacote does not even do that.</li>
    <li> I am typing this review with my beautiful talons as we speak!  Lol!  This stuff is amazing!!!  And yes, there is definitely a burn when you first use it..so prepare yourself.  But the burn diminishes over time as you use it more.  Here&#x27;s a tip: use it for the first time without adding any color.  I&#x27;ve noticed that makes it burn less.  That&#x27;s been my experience at least.  My nails have never been this long for this length of time before...I am loving my natural nails again!  My nails are usually so thin and weak but not anymore...not with this magical potion. lol  And side bonus: it locks in your nail color for the longest time!!  I&#x27;ve had my nails painted for 4 days now with absolutely NO chipping in the color.  I would use this product for that benefit alone.  And it gives it the most beautiful glossy finish...more so than any top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m almost out so I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering another bottle...again and again!</li>
    <li> Love this polish. It reallymakes ya nails grow longer and stronger. U see results in less then 3 wks. They dont break or get brittle anymore. I use it three times a week since nails are stronger but first use everyday till u see results. It lasts about four months. Im on second bottle.</li>
    <li> This help my nails grow and not chip and break.  I have been looking for it since my manicurist stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works super great on my nails that used to split and break. My nails are now growing longer and have hardened which makes for longer nails! Yes!! Great and fast transaction!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery , good product</li>
    <li> I had problems with brittle,peeling fingernails for years and tried all kinds of remedies.&lt;br /&gt;Once I started to use Duri Rejuvacote as nailpolish, nothing else!,my nails started to look nice and healthy.I have used this now for 3 years,as base coat and top coat.My nails are natural and beautiful thanks to Duri Rejuvacote.</li>
    <li> Worked not as well as I thought it would. My nails are a bit harder but still tend to break . I am not as consistent as I should be applying it though so I gave it four stars.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and I can actually say that it has worked for me. I have noticed them growing faster then normal, but the best part is that my nails aren&#x27;t as brittle as they use to be.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best nail growth product I&#x27;ve ever used - and I&#x27;ve used many! My nails were a mess after having Gel nails so I gave Rejuvacote a try.  My nails are now stronger than they&#x27;ve ever been.  I have a full review of the product at [...]</li>
    <li> This is a real solution to ugly short nails.  This item is truly a solution to short, ugly  soft nails.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, and a great price too!  Made my nails stronger, faster after taking off my acrylics.  Now if I could only stop biting them . . . .</li>
    <li> This was brought for my daughter that had previously used this.  It has worked wonders on her nails.  They have grown tremendously.  The only down sides to this product was that it isn&#x27;t readily available.</li>
    <li> I love this nail growth system.  A student&#x27;s mom recommended it to me and my nails have new life.  I have to cut them now because they grow so strongly that they rarely break.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best products. We are using a lot for ours clients.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom, she&#x27;s really impressed with it. She said her nails seem much healthier and stronger. So thank you Duri and Amazon for getting me some awesome son points.</li>
    <li> Although because of the smell, I have failed to do it daily. Noticed that the ridges in my nails are now gone I feel like if I followed the instructions and used as mentioned, my nails would probably be very long as stated. As I look at them now, I can tell that they have grown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is the most fabulous product I have found.  I did not need my nails to be strenghend.  I need my nails to stop splitting and this product has done that.</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I am trying to repair my nails after using Gel polishes.  This product is awsome! I have and will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I apply this to my nails to strengthen them.  I no longer have to use acrylics or gel nails.  Saves me tons of money on manicures.</li>
    <li> This treatment seems to work for many people, but it hasn&#x27;t worked well for me.  The product tends to thicken quickly and applying color on top of it hasn&#x27;t worked well for me.  My nails are actually more dry and damaged since I began using this.</li>
    <li> My nails were so brittle and weak from using shellac and gel. I started using this product and within several weeks my nails were growing and not peeling. I went to have a manicure and was told my nails were very strong and healthy. This product made a huge difference in my nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not super finicky about my nails but I like them to look nice. As I&#x27;ve gotten (just a tiny bit) older, my nails have developed ridges and will split and peel. The Rejuvacote has stopped the splitting and peeling, and my nails are stronger and don&#x27;t chip as easily as they used to. The ridges are diminished but still visible. I like the fact that you can use it alone or over polish. I&#x27;ve used it enough that I&#x27;m down to every other day and it still is working well for me. I didn&#x27;t have any bad reactions or problems like some others talked about. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the first product that help my nails to really grow, and grow quickly!!!!! I&amp;#34;ve told all my friends about it.</li>
    <li> I thought this would help thin nails.  It is just a thick hard polish coat.  After several layers (they recommended a new layer every day) it peels off easily, but I do not see any benefits from the polish.</li>
    <li> I could see the difference in my dry flaky nails in a week. I would surely buy it again &amp; if you have problem nails get some.</li>
    <li> Did wonders for my peeling nails! Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. I find it very successful.</li>
    <li> For anyone afraid your nails won&#x27;t grow after removing acrylics  think again! In less than 5 weeks my nails are long, strong and  healthy thanks to Rejuvacote..the ridges from acrylic are the only evidence of 15 yrs of wearing fake nails and in another 4 weeks those will be gone! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Rujuvacote! Wish I had known about it sooner! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Toxic ingredients. All around DANGEROUS.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Ethly acetate, n-butyl acetate, nitrocellulose, toulenesulfonamide, formaldehyde, resin dibutyl, phthalate, isopropyl alcohol, camphor, calcium pantothenate, gelatin, hydrolized keratin protein.</li>
    <li> The best for your nail I never had my nail so beauitful in my life I have told peopel about it I bought a lot gave them for gifts and now they like it and now they are order this product LOVE IT Ann</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s helping my growth,  still too early to judge, but I&#x27;m hopeful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a biter but I still couldn&#x27;t grow my nails because they would chip &amp; peel so easily.  I use Rejuvacote as my base for every manicure and after a month my nails look amazing and healthy.  I will order this again and again</li>
    <li> The product is amazing in keeping your nails strong. Product arrived very quickly. After a few weeks of daily use this product can be  used just a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I used to have splitting nails. peeling at top so i wore fake nails-  but i heard about this polish-  now this polish has repaired that. I have long natural nails now!  I put it on daily til they grew &amp; then after they were stronger I just use once a week now. I do paint my nails once a week..</li>
    <li> After two weeks I see adifference</li>
    <li> this is the only nail polish i can use that doesn&#x27;t break my nails!  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It actually strengthens weak nails too.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish... Have been using it for years. Makes my nails strong, and they grow and don&#x27;t peel.</li>
    <li> This product realy work.  This summer I decided to removed the gel from my nails and they are were very weak.  I friend gave me what was left in one of the bottle that she had.  My nails are becoming healthy and strong.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has help harden my nails when no other product I tried could. I will always use this as my  base coat and my top coat when doing my nails.!!!! And when I ordered it, it arrived at my home in no time.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! it really works!!!! I highly recomended. I had tell my friends and fa. about. I got positves results.</li>
    <li> It did not prevent my nails from splitting.</li>
    <li> I spent tons of money on all sorts of products and systems, promising long, healthy nails.  They never worked. I could peel my nails right off and it looked like I was biting them...until I got myself a bottle of Rejuvacote.  I now have nice, hard nails and I am not embarassed to show my hands anymore.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sister in law recommended this and I bought one for myself and sister. We both have longer stronger nails Evan after you take it off or it wears off the nails still remain strong. Both my sister and myself have always have had thin nails that we have never been able to grow out. Not now!! Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> Amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;Nails stronger than ever after less than a month of continued use, as directed!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buying more asap!&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it claims! Even when nails are free of any polish (aka naked).&lt;br /&gt;After years of acrylics, and almost a year (this time) continued acrylics... Nails were horrible and ate up after acrylic removal! This stuff works miracles. I saw improvement within a week. Buy it...it works.</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with the result, neede more time to have my nails grow , but no chipping and looks so much healthier. Before I never knew about rejuvacote, untill my nail lady recommended to me.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am recommending to other.</li>
    <li> I read about this in an Allure magazine and gave it a try.  It&#x27;s only been two weeks and there&#x27;s a remarkable difference in my nails.  I&#x27;m more than pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is a miracle!!! I have been trying to grow my nails for years, they are not too thin but they split and brake ALL THE TIME!! I have try many many things with little luck and that&#x27;s why I decided to give this a try, and oh wow I am so impress I can&#x27;t still believe it&#x27;s really working. I follow the instructions and I have been using this for only a month. My nails are doble the size they were and have not split or brake. I&#x27;m also amazed how long my polish lasts on with this stuff I go 5 days with only a little wear on the tips and that&#x27;s it!! I think I could get 7 days of wear but I get tired and just like to change my mani quite often. I already bought the 4oz refill bottle!!</li>
    <li> My nails peel and also split horizonally down in the nail bed. After the worst episode of this, where almost every nail on my hands were broken way down and peeling, I tried expensive products ($12-$24 from beauty supply stores) with no improvement. I was placing an Amazon order, and decided to add 2 bottles of Duri Rejuvacote. What a difference this product makes! My nail are mostly grown out now, after about 3 months of use, and look good. I apply one or two coats every day, and file my nails down to where the split or peel is when they grow out enough. Now I have no splitting or peeling. One piece of advice:  DON&#x27;T GET THE PRODUCT ON YOUR CUTICLES. For some reason, if you get a little messy and it gets on your cuticle, it is very harsh and causes the cuticle to get rough and cracked.</li>
    <li> I love this for nail growth. I have worn acrylic nails since high school and my nails were damaged. They would grow but break off quick. It has definitely helped my dry brittle nails. They are strong and grow very fast now. I have read alot of reviews and some complain about this containing formaldehyde which is untrue. Formaldehyde resin and formaldehyde is not the same. Here is a link to a cosmetics review I found. Very helpful.  [...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had nails like I do today. I used it everyday for a week before I saw the difference . My nails are normally very thin and split so easily.  I forget to use this now so it&#x27;s more like 2 X a week but it&#x27;s amazing how long they&#x27;re getting. Some have still chipped because I do a lot with my hands but overall they are at their peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice to people where it hurts them: if you can&#x27;t use this product I would suggest making a topcoat solution by adding a ton of minced fresh garlic in it. This is another wonderful trick of growing/hardening nails except it does smell like garlic.  The only other thing that ever worked for me</li>
    <li> This is a miracle worker!  My nails have never been this healthy and long!  Everyone I have recommended it to had had the same result!</li>
    <li> love love love the product best nail growth system I have ever used I bought some for some of my friends and they love it also</li>
    <li> Great products for my nails. Use it as a base coat under all my manicures. I helps stop breakage. .</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions this product does exactly what it says it will do.  My nails have never looked so good.</li>
    <li> My sister and niece both used this product and loved it so I thought I would try it. My nails have never looked better and I don&#x27;t have to pay the salon price.</li>
    <li> Great product to strengthen the nails.  I have been repairing my nails with this product after having the gels put on during my mani cure.</li>
    <li> Never could get my nails to grow, tried everything.  Then my girlfriend who does nails told me to try this wonderful product . . . it is marvelous . . . follow the instructions and within the next month there is such a change.  I&#x27;ve been using it almost a year now and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now keeping tabs on  nail growth and may report back later. In the process of formulating a guide to precise measurement.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my wife surrogate likes the product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Everyone&#x27;s different, I had no issues with the pain in the nails like some people experienced. My nails are so strong and are looking amazing</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Within 2 weeks of using I had longer nails than I have ever had in my life and after using several weeks had to trim my nails a little. I am glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product three times and I will continue to use it for my once  brittle nails that are now strong</li>
    <li> This product is incredible!!</li>
    <li> I could not find this item in the store, so I decided to look online. The polish came in a timely manner and it is exactly what I wanted. I am so glad to get another bottle. It is a great product and does a great job. Thanks</li>
    <li> Chemotherapy really does a number on your nails. My chemo was finished and several weeks later my nails started to shred. It was driving me nuts. I don&#x27;t even care what they look like, but having them tearing and catching on everything was painful and annoying. The Rejuvacote was just the ticket. They looked better immediately with the product applied and they have stopped tearing. I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have noticed some reviewers complain about pain. I had NO pain whatsoever. If you do have pain, you have a sensitivity to an ingredient in this product and should not use it. The pain is not something to &amp;#34;push through&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Appears to be repairing my nails after months of UV gel polish usage. Much less breakage than before and less bendiness, so these are good things.</li>
    <li> Just love it and seems to be the only hardener that works!</li>
    <li> Ever since my manicurist started wrapping and then heating my nails, they have been horrible for almost a year.  I don&#x27;t have the greatest diet I&#x27;ll admit.  My job doesn&#x27;t help either.  BUT since I have been using rejuvacote they are growing!  I can&#x27;t wait for them to grow a little more so I can wear polish again.</li>
    <li> Actually works. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> The best of all, my nails hardly break.</li>
    <li> I received this Duri Rejuvacote as a birthday present and just purchased my second bottle because I liked it so much.  I recommend this product because it actually made my nails grow stronger.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nail product that helps your nails grow longer and stronger.  Buy it now!  :)</li>
    <li> It has worked for me.</li>
    <li> I apply it once every three days, In week I saw white tips of my nail growing, mind you I&#x27;m a male. You know how men bite nails. I was happy. Now my nails grew past the tip of my finger. If your going somewhere important with in one-two weeks please buy this product . I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the outcome. the best on the market so far.</li>
    <li> I have use this stuff before and was very satisfied. This is my second bottle. Recommended to all my friends.</li>
    <li> My jury is out as to the effectiveness of this product.  I just bought it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and NEVER have a problem with my nails.  I have to cut them since they never break and are hard and easy to care for.  You will love this product.</li>
    <li> Using this for many years, does make your nail hard and strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rejuvacote for over a year and it has really helped strengthen my nails.  I take it off once a week, put Vitamin E oil on my nails/cuticles, and then apply 2 new coats the next morning (apply as needed during the week).  My only issue is that about the last 1/4 of the bottle gets very thick and is hard to apply smoothly.  Sometimes I add a little from a new bottle to thin it out and get more usage but usually throw out some of the product in the first bottle.</li>
    <li> I like the product for a nail polish it stays on longer than any other I have used,but do not see any more strength in my nails yet,they still split and break.</li>
    <li> First off, yes this product has formaldehyde, but that just means that it has a strong meaning. Meaning: don&#x27;t paint your nails in a closet. Honestly, you&#x27;re fine painting it in your room, living room, even a dorm room with the door open. I have the smallest single person dorm, and I paint my nails with this all the time. However, professionals say to paint it in a well ventilated area, so opening a window and turning on a fan if advised. Also, I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to the formaldehyde or anything, and I get this product on my skin constantly because I&#x27;m so bad at painting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this product is so amazing. I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen Hard as Nails, Sally Hansen Advanced Hard as Nails, Sally Hansen Nail Nutrition Green Tea + Bamboo, and OPI Nail Envy, and none have really worked for me. Yes they&#x27;ve made my nails somewhat strong, but my nails still managed to break. With this my nails never break, unless already have a crack, and they become rock hard. I mean so hard that you can&#x27;t even bend your nail back in a flexible way. Also you nails begin to grow a lot at a much more obvious rate.&lt;br /&gt;After the first two weeks or so, you don&#x27;t have to keep painting a new layer every day. It&#x27;s more like two coats a week (Not that it was a problem, the polish dries SUPER fast). And after a while you notice your nails are just overall healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Once I stopped because I noticed that my nails were doing a lot better, (and because the bottle finished) but I began about a month later, when I couldn&#x27;t get my nails to get as long as they were with Duri. I ordered again and will probably never stop again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I live in the north in a very cold and dry climate so my nails are extra sensitive compared to when I was in Georgia. I&#x27;ve also never used gels or acrylics.</li>
    <li> I am so happy bough  this item. Y help me my nail look great,  and strong. Happy to find this product</li>
    <li> it is alright as a top coat, nothing spectacular about it tho</li>
    <li> good! But not great !</li>
    <li> Chipped the next day. A friend of mine let me use hers I was so impressed I ordered it from Amazon not sure if I got a old bottle either way it&#x27;s no bueno!</li>
    <li> Not only did I find it works, each and every friend I recommended to agrees!  I&#x27;m completely sold on the product.</li>
    <li> This polish does work. I have used it years ago. I bought it at one of local pharmacies. I need it now again because I ruined my nails with acrylic tips and with gel. First time I applied fake nails and glue didn&#x27;t work well on my nails. This polish fixed my nails pretty fast. Also dont forget about multivitamins, they also help nails grow faster :)</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve tried lots of nail hardeners and growth products over the years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. It doesn&#x27;t yellow nails like Nail Envy does and I finally have nails I have to trim back instead of struggling to grow out.</li>
    <li> Rejuvacote totally rejuvinated my nails. For months they were not growing. Once I started to use this  product, my beautiful nails  returned. It&#x27;s magic!</li>
    <li> This stuff peels right off.  For all the hype I expected more.  I applied 2 coats and still it was peeling off the next day.  A far superior product is OPI Nail Envy.</li>
    <li> My wife and her mother use this product often. They say it really does make a difference. They both have beautiful nails!!!!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers, this thing burns like hell, at least for an hour.  I wanted to cut my fingers off. LOL.  However, I continue using the product.  Im currently on my second week and I can still feel the burning sensation, but not as bad as the first days, however, I can see the difference.  Dont let the burning discourage you.  My coworker was using it at the same time and she did not had any problems.  We dont understand why my fingers burned and not hers, our theory is that i had been using gel nails for a few years and not her.</li>
    <li> All I can say is, if you do as the directions state, your nails will grow and become stronger. I use this as my base coat for every mani that I do now. It became the miracle cure for my weak, brittle, peeling, breaking nails. I haven&#x27;t had a problem since! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It was fine DO Not send me any more emails about this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since February of this year and my nails have grown and strengthened so much that I now get compliments on them. I always thought it was impossible for me to have long healthy nails because they would chip, layer or break so easily. This product works! My only recommendation is that your moisturize your nails when using this.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail strengthener and serves as a must-have base coat for me. I had brittle and splitting nails, and had to wean myself off of acrylics. This Rejuvacote polish has allowed to me have lovely natural nails.</li>
    <li> helped my nails a lot.</li>
    <li> DURI REJUVACOTE SYSTEM IS JUST FANTASTIC.  IT REALLY HELPS TO STRENGTHEN MY NAILS WHICH WOULD BREAK WITHOUT IT.  I ESPECIALLY LOVE THEIR BASE WHICH I HAVE INTRODUCED TO MY MANICURIST AND SHE HAS ALSO INTRODUCED IT TO OTHER LADIES.  MY NAILS HAVE STOPPED BREAKING AND STRENGHTNED SO MUCH OVER THE YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN USING IT.  IT IS WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> Helps increase nail growth without all the super nasty chemicals in OPI Nail Envy.</li>
    <li> My nails are stronger and getting stronger every day</li>
    <li> Only thing that helps my nails grow without breaking all the time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful nail polish!  Really does help with keeping nails healthy and long.</li>
    <li> I believe this product has helped improve my nails greatly.  They seem to be growing and not splitting.  My manicurist convinced me to use it and I am glad she did.</li>
    <li> I have been using Duri Rejuvacote as directed for the last few months and I absolutely love it. My nails are stronger, longer, and I am very impressed by this product. As an avid nail polish collector and a constant manicure changer, this is my go to base coat. I wont use anything else anymore, plus its half the price of a bottle of OPI Nail Envy- which if you stop using Nail Envy, your nails become brittle and peel- I just moved and have had bare nails for the last week or two and they are still strong and not brittle thanks to Duri. Duri Rejuvacote for the win.</li>
    <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T USED AS OFTEN AS I SHOULD&#x27;VE SO MY EXPEREINCE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. MY NAILS ARE AS STRONG AS I THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE, BUT THEY ARE WHEN THE NAIL POLISH IS ON.</li>
    <li> My manicurist uses this as a base coat, and I can see why; it&#x27;s a terrific treatment for nails.  I try to use it on a daily basis to improve overall nail health, even if I don&#x27;t have any other polish on.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> i have tried a lot of basecoats, but none worked so well for my peeling and weak nails. I tried it because of the good reviews and so glad I did!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that was given to me by a friend.My nails are in much better condition and I have recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I recommend for anyone looking to have strong beautiful nails. Applied daily and watched the magic happen!</li>
    <li> It worked for me. My nails are stronger and it didn&#x27;t take too much time. Excellent. I recommend this product. Give it a try!!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nail growth product that would work as good as Revivanail! This is it!! So glad!</li>
    <li> My nails are paper thin so I tried Rejuvacote.  In 2 weeks, my nails grew and grew strong.  I could not believe it !  I cannot wrap my nails too sensitive.  But this product works !  I need to buy more !</li>
    <li> One word Formaldehyde!  I put this on my nails and within 20 minutes I started experience pain under my nails. I immediately removed it and scrubbed my hands after reading that Formaldehyde was one of the main ingredients.  Stay away!</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time. Amazon has the best price. As I have posted before, there is nothing else I have found to be as effective as Duri. I had very thin soft nails a few years ago as I wore acrylic nails for many years. This product helped me to grow my nails long and hard again. People still ask me if my nails are acrylic. You do have to be patient and use this product faithfully. I use it all the time. Not only does it make my nails strong, but keeps my nail polish on longer. I use it as a base coat and a top coat.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by the Lady that does my nails.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 weeks, but it does seem to be helping.</li>
    <li> I never had nice nails no matter how hard I tried to look after them.  Wow, now I love wearing rings.</li>
    <li> It has a strong smell but it really did make my nails grow. My nails are very fragile, they chip and peel easily. But when i applied this it made them strong and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Ive been using acrylic nail for a while and decided to take them off and try to grow my own. However, after removal of the acrylics, my natural nails were paper thin and splitting. After reading the reviews on Amazon about Rejuvacote Nail Growth System ( good and bad) I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s only been a week since I started using it but so far my nail beds are much stronger and I can actually see a slight growth in the nails. I use it every day and have only experienced the burning sensation once. I would recommend this product to those who have weak nails and nail beds. Will keep you updated on my experience after continuous use.</li>
    <li> I apply some on my nails each morning and after a couple minutes they are dry! Works as a base or top coat if you want to paint them. My nails used to tear, bend, and couldn&#x27;t get very long. Now my nails have grown stronger and longer then ever! I noticed results in just one week of using. I have never received complements on my nails until now. They look great and I&#x27;m so happy! I have tried many other nail repair polish, but this is by far the best one.</li>
    <li> It protects my nails very well.  I&#x27;m using it instead of Nailtique 2. I use it as base coat only.  Sometimes add a coat during the week.</li>
    <li> Great,now if I can get 2 more that I pd for.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for years , and my nails are fine when I do.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for after acrylic.  I had on acrylic nail for  over 30 years and a nail that was split this product has given me my nails back healthy long and strong</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my friend, however didn&#x27;t work on my nails. Usually nail polish stays for 5-7 days, but combined with this product lasts for 3 days only.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great as a clear polish while projecting and nurshing the nails.  I have recommended it highly to friends.</li>
    <li> After years of having gels, this worked for me and no more trips to the manicurist.</li>
    <li> I am a professional pianist and have had years of coping with broken, split nails - they are so traumatized that even between jobs my nails do not grow in a healthy way. A manicurist shook her head when she saw them and recommended this product. In one month, my nails are not breaking, not splitting and not peeling. They seem much stronger and this product will travel with me wherever I go! It is recommended that you apply a coat every day and it does seem to be the best way to achieve good results.</li>
    <li> Its an excellent product and works just like it says on the bottle!</li>
    <li> Great topper for polish. Really helps keep polish looking good!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Incredible.  My Nails have never looked as healthy and had never grown the way the are growing today.  I just love this product and have given samples to a couple of my friends and my sister, and they have gotten excellent results as wel</li>
    <li> It really works on my nails. When I put it on and chip one a little I can repair very quickly.</li>
    <li> Must have if you are looking to grow your nails</li>
    <li> The vendor changed therefore the price increased. :-(  Despite the increase it&#x27;s worth buying.  My nails look &amp;#34;GREAT&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It is the one product I have used that really helps my nails grow stronger.</li>
    <li> works well, Makes nails look beautiful, felt stronger nails in 1-1/2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to tell , guess it takes awhile. Seems ok so far</li>
    <li> Duri Rejuvacote is the absolute best for anyone who has peeling weak nails. Like the directions say, you have to be consistent in putting it on to get the results you want. It takes about a month to get stronger nails.</li>
    <li> I LOVE rejuvacote. My nails were badly damaged due to years of acrylic nail use. This item restored my nails and helped them grow longer and stronger. I would DEFINITELY recommend this item to anyone wanting to improve their nails.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years after my cousin introduced it to me.  Really helps keep my nails healthy and strong.</li>
    <li> I wore fake nails for over 18 years.I use to be a hair stylist and felt better with longer nails. I wanted to take them off but was afraid that my own nails would be ruined. I searched the web and Amazon had this wonderful product, DURI REJUVACOTE NAIL GROWTH SYSTEM..I decided to try it. I could not believe the difference in my nails in such a short of time. It only took a few weeks and I have my own nails and they are stronger than they have ever been. I would recommend this product for everyone. It is easy to use and dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this great product.&lt;br /&gt;Jen</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years now and my nails are so strong and long I get compliments all the time.  If you want beautiful nails, his is the product for you.</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievable. I have used it as directed faithfully for 2 months and my nails are truly to die for! I have NEVER had nice nails and now I have them! Just had my first french manicure because I actually have long nails and real white areas! Thanks, Duri - just love you and have recommended it to several friends!</li>
    <li> This product is without a doubt the best Nail Growth System there is.  Everyone should try it for themselves and see just what a great product.</li>
    <li> Used it forever. Really made my nails harder. I used to have nails that peeled off layers, not since using this. The packaging is different this time, but I assume same stuff</li>
    <li> For the first time ever, I&#x27;ve found something that actually helps my weak, pathetic nails. While I don&#x27;t apply it every day like is recommended, I do reapply about every week. With regular use (either under nail polish or by itself) I did actually notice stronger nails. I have tried every Sally Hansen product, OPI, Orly, and Nailtiques, and this is the first that has given me any results. Worth it!</li>
    <li> Decent polish to help your nails grow and strengthen them but not as good as nailtique in my opinion. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> This is a really great product, I have never been able to grow  nails  before, Now they are very strong and very long.I gave it to my friend.</li>
    <li> I love it, only thing that works for my nail. Just bought another bottle for my Mother.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t believe how well it works, try it! VERY EASY, NO PROBLEMS. twice a day, or whatever. we like it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, gives me longer,stronger nails as long as I follow instructions for use. will continue to use duracote</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on for me. Peels within 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> I had a nail injury 30 years ago and have had a completely split nail ever since.  Have tried multiple products and this one did the trick.  It&#x27;s been a year but the split is gone and I&#x27;ve even grown a normal nail.  Excellent product! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best nail restorer I have ever used!  I have always had a problem with my nails.  After wearing acrylics for a few years, my nails were horrible...thin, wouldn&#x27;t grow, looked terrible!  I have tried product after product, with no change.  After using Rejuvacote for a week, I could tell a difference!  Now, after two months, my nails are unbelievable---they are strong, pretty, and growing!  Also, when I use this as a top coat, my polish lasts for a week or more without chipping or peeling!  This is a wonderful product....worth much more than the cost!  I would recommend it to anyone who has problem nails!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! My nails are so long and very strong. They do not break or crack. They grew fast. I strongly recommend this for anyone who wants great nails.</li>
    <li> After wearing it for several weeks and following the directions precisely, I saw no change. My nails did not grow and they were still very flimsy. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me but I have friends who loves it.</li>
    <li> If you have thin weak nails, this is just for you!!  My manicurist told me about rejuvicoat and suggested I give it a try.  So very glad I did!!  My nails have never been better!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Buy it BUT!! This makes your nails grow but not as fast as you would think. I hate when I&#x27;m almost out because it tends to get very gluey and thick. But a fresh bottle always works wonders. Now, when you get this if you really want your nails to grow rapidly, purchase Biotin 5000mcg and take one a day. It will make your nails grow in 1 week you should see drastic results along with using this polish. Oh and when you do get the nails you desire, take care of them. Please.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to evaluate.</li>
    <li> My nails are growing..yeah at last!!!</li>
    <li> I have never had long strong healthy beautiful nails before using this!!!! Believe me your nails WILL grow with this product! !!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years with excellent results!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuvacote off and on for the past few years.  I have a bad habit of biting  my nails, and every time I resolve to let them grow again I use Duri Rejuvacote.  As long as I use as directed, it only takes a week or two for my nails to grow back and look nice again. If only I could stick with it!!  Maybe this time...</li>
    <li> Great product. My nails are getting harder and finally growing back after years of abuse with acrylic and gel products.</li>
    <li> Very fast transaction.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> So far I like what it is doing to my nails. I needed help after putting on acrylic nail, and it seems to be doing the trick. I would definitely recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend ordered this, and has been using it for about three weeks.  She works in retail at a home improvement store, so her fingernails are apt to snag, break, etc.  This product has worked wonders.  Her nails are all growing at the same rate, and there has been no breakage.  In addition, she is ecstatic that her manicures need less maintenance.</li>
    <li> seems to be working so far.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Just what I was looking for to help strengthen my nails.  It works</li>
    <li> This was missing from the box in my order.  Did not receive and so I am giving one star for the fact that it was missing, not on how the product works.</li>
    <li> This produce actually works as advertised.  If you use it the way the directions say, your nail do get stronger and healthier</li>
    <li> Rejuvacote has improved my weak, brittle nails. They used to split &amp; tear all the time. Now I&#x27;m having to clip &amp; file my nails because they actually grow. Amazing!</li>
    <li> As far as I am concerned, this is a miracle product.  After turning 50 I began struggling with peeling nails.  I tried every product I could find but nothing made any real difference - until this.  I followed the recommended  regimen religiously and I now actually have nails to the end of my fingers on all fingers.  I am so thrilled. My only regret:  I use a lovely pale pink polish and now the Rejuvacote is tinted red whereas it used to be clear.  It affects the color of my polish...I think it should be neutral (clear).</li>
    <li> on rejuvacote.  i have really weak, broken nails.  product makes them stronger and i can grow them longer.</li>
    <li> It was hard to find the ingredients, but for those who have had bad reactions to other nail products with formalin/formaldehyde/tolulene, here are the Rejuvacote ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethyl Acetate, butyl acetate, nitrocellulose, toluenesulfonamide/formaldehyde resin, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, trymethyl penthanyl, dissobutyrate, camphor, hydrolized wheat protein, hydrolyzed keratin, hydrolized soy protein, calcium pantothenate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: if you test this first and use only every 2-3 weeks, shouldn&#x27;t be a big problem. I play guitar and my thin nails take a beating, so I&#x27;ve tried several products. They should have listed the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING REJUVACOTE NAIL GROWTH SYSTEM FOR A MONTH NOW AND AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE WAY MY NAILS ARE IMPROVING.&lt;br /&gt;THEY WERE IN BAD SHAPE AFTER HAVING ACRYLIC NAILS TAKEN OFF AND I AM SEEING A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN JUST ONE MONTH. I WILL BE ORDERING MORE OF THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT HESITATION.</li>
    <li> I use this product to protect and strengthen my nails along with taking biotin.  It goes on smoothly and provides a shine.  I use it as a top coat on polish or alone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I notice that my nails are sooo much stronger.  Don&#x27;t know if they actually are growing faster, but they are definitely getting longer because they aren&#x27;t breaking off nearly as easily.  Works great as a top/bottom coat too.</li>
    <li> A great product to help problem nails grow.  I highly recommend it, it strengthens and lengthens nails with continuous use.</li>
    <li> I totally love this stuff. I got a prescription for it from my dermatologist (he actually had the bottle at the&amp;#34;front desk&amp;#34; for $15), but I skipped that offer and looked on Amazon and got the exact same thing for 1/2 the price. I have recommended this to a number of friends that have ridges in their nails. Just do what the instructions say and your nails will look great!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 50 years old and always suffered from weak nails. My nails never grew too long and they tore like a paper as soon as they grew a little. Every time I used nail polish, my nails would start breaking soon after 2 or 3 days. Until one of my friends suggested me to try the Duri Rejuvacote and after using it for past three weeks, I noticed for the first time in my life my nails are becoming strong and growing without any breakage. This product really works. I use it as the base coat and then apply the regular nail polish and top it with Duri Brush N Go.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> While some of the reviews stated that this hurt their fingers and they are correct, I still love this stuff. I did find that the thinner the nail the more it hurt. But all in all, it really does work!</li>
    <li> I have been using Duri Rejuvacote for 5 weeks now and still do not see any improvement in the growth or strength of my nails.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  My nails were split and are very soft but when I started using this they got much better.  I can actually grow them now.</li>
    <li> Good product! For growth of nails...however it does not help nails that are split.&lt;br /&gt;Hardens and grows nails. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> What a fantastic produce!  It&#x27;s great to have 10 fabulous nails!!  And,when one is broken, it grows back quickly!</li>
    <li> It is working.It make the nail stronger.I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing for brittle nails. I had gotten a few gel manicures and kept peeling them off after it started coming up....so my nails were a mess. After using this product for a few times my nails are already improving. Great to wear by itself or even as an undercoat. I&#x27;m so glad I found this stuff!!! I can&#x27;t say enough positive things!</li>
    <li> The only nail product that helps my nail to be harder and grow faster</li>
    <li> Was very concerned about burning sensation described by other reviewers since I have very thin, damaged nails (long time gel use) but needed to find something to help me build up my nails.  I actually documented the first week of use to help others who may also be worried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 - After 10 minutes - Horrible burning!  Just as others described I felt like all my fingers were on fire!  Lasted well over an hour (did not track carefully) and I almost gave up but decided to keep trying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 - Applied Rejuvacote and watched the clock.  Again, all nails BURNED so badly I thought I would cry.  Lasted just about an hour and then faded to ache.  Done after about 1.5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 - Started feeling a tingle after 10-15 minutes of application.  This time, only 2-3 of my fingers on each hand burned - seems to be the ones where nails are most damaged -looking and thin.  Burning decreased after 30 minutes and was completely gone in less than an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4 and 5 - Similar to Day 3 - but took less than 30 minutes for burning to go away;  nails are still very weak and so are \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; where they go past the nail bed.  This was mostly gone by Day 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 6 - Almost no burning - just a dull ache; nails are very weak but not splitting as much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 7 - Took off all the layers and applied fresh new coat of rejuvacote.  Nails are thin - could see patches of red in a few areas so was prepared for a repeat of Day 1 but almost nothing happened (just a slight ache - so little I am not sure if I imagined it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nails still have a long way way to go but now that I am past the first few days, I am very excited about the early progress.  more updates after enough time has passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review - after 1 month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have now used Rejuvacote regularly - putting a new coat on every day, removing and starting fresh every 6-7 days.  First the good news:  No more burning!  I have not felt anything other than an occasional twinge.  Whew!  Now the bad (or neutral news):  my nails still have a LONG way to go.  So far, I cannot say this is a miracle cure.  Given how bad my nails were (thin, very short), I am not surprised.  I do see a difference - my nails are definitely stronger and able to stand up more to the abuse that results from all my travel and activity.  On most fingers I am seeing a bit of \\&quot;white\\&quot; as the nail grows out.  For my thumbs, however, I am finding it hard to get the growth.  The reason I keep using it is that I see some improvement and when I do take off the Rejuvacote, I notice my nails are much more likely to snag / break so it is definitely better with it on.  I think some of the issues are when I get to to day 5 or 6, the polish tends to crack on some nails, and then if I do not remove the polish and start over, I am more prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - I will be buying another bottle and continuing the regimen.  Since there is no burning anymore and I am seeing gradual improvement (this is the best my nails have done in over 20 years), I feel this product is worthwhile.  I still hold out hope that I will see the amazing results others describe.  If not, I believe I am at least seeing enough improvement that I am encouraged to stay away from all the no chip or artificial nail options&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Month 2 - Update.  I am now on my second bottle of this product.  My nails are most definitely better.  I am still using the product daily - my nails need the support.  Most of my nails are at / longer than the tips of my fingers and as long as I use every day and replace every 6-7 days.  I am tempted to move this up to 5 stars - I still cannot believe how much better my nails are in just about 6 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Month 4 - Update.  I am now am starting my 4th bottle and I am a HUGE fan.  For the first time in my life, I have two hands with beautiful nails.  It is no longer just the product that is strengthening my nails - they are strong on their own(without polish for several days).  I am astounded at this outcome and absolutely thrilled.  I travel 3 days a week and haul suitcases, etc. all the time so my nails are not pampered.  I am now shifting down to using this product a few times a week but I just placed another order and my daughter is asking for a bottle.  If you are patient, it is absolutely amazing.  I have never in 49 years been so happy with how my natural nails look  - and I am saving a ton of money and time on no chip or artificial nail options.(without polish for several days).  I am astounded at this outcome and absolutely thrilled.  I travel 3 days a week and haul suitcases, etc. all the time so my nails are not pampered.

    <li> No Formaldehyde until death...embalming fluid. This product is widely used in baby and children products. Another buckle by the GOV. &amp;#34;Who will be the first to make an organic nail hardener.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for over ten years and love it.  It works!  It is a light shine and my nails grow quickly, with splitting or cracking!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and this is the only one that has improved my nails. Found it in a nail salon in Scottsdale, AZ and now happy to be able to purchase it online.</li>
    <li> This bottle of product did not work nearly as well as the first bottle. This bottle seems weak. Nails have not grown much at all.</li>
    <li> My nails have always been extremely brittle. I am a nail biter and I guess the years of biting have been really bad on my nails! SO. I got this product and what can I say? It works fantastic. Its been two weeks and my nails are much stronger than before and not only that, they also are getting longer! I actually have more than just a nail plate! I can turn my hands over and see my nails on the other side. I highly recommend to everyone. No problems or weird side effects. It works great.</li>
    <li> Dear Sir;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of yet, I have not received it . Please have someone from the company&lt;br /&gt;contact me.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Makena</li>
    <li> I tried this product because my bf told me how great it was .... She was right - it really works great....</li>
    <li> This is magic!!  It really works and does not make nails yellow</li>
    <li> I decided to stop using acrylic nails, and needed some help with strengthening my damaged nails.  My manicurist suggested this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have noticed my nails are no longer peeling, splitting and breaking very easily.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me to improve my nails that were splitting and so far I am well pleased with the results</li>
    <li> My nails have started growing and look much healthier since I&#x27;ve been using the product glad I picked it up.</li>
    <li> Had \\&quot;forever French\\&quot; nails for over 3 years.  When I stopped getting them done my nails were weak.  Used Duri and within 2 weeks, my nails became stronger and longer.  I&#x27;ve been using Duri for over a year now and I wouldn&#x27;t switch to another brand.  I bring it with me to my nail salon.</li>
    <li> Did not use.  Liquid was cloudy and I figured it was old.</li>
    <li> The nail polish peels off very easily (after one day).</li>
    <li> Love love love I live by this product I always buy 3 at a time!!! Strengthens and hardens your nails by far the best on the market</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! Not only has it kept me from biting my nails, but it has made them grow quickly. They&#x27;re also much stronger and more beautiful than ever. My mother and grandmother used mine and now purchase it for themselves. I&#x27;m telling you, this stuff works! It also dries incredibly fast, which I love. I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time worrying about touching things.</li>
    <li> Iwas recomended this product and this is my second bottle...it has help my nails,but...it does not stay on, not even a couple of days, I don&#x27;t have the time to be doing my nails every day.....I don&#x27;t even wash dishes, so I need a product that last long.....I try two bottles and the same issue.</li>
    <li> The price is right, it came very quickly, was very well packaged, will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I used Pink Armor prior to this order and I have to say I like Pink Armor better.  This is thin, smelly and chips off easily.  Yes, it is less expensive but it also doesn&#x27;t have the pretty soft pink hue that Pink Armor has.</li>
    <li> Although the nail tech had raved about this product, I was not impressed.  Granted, I have very poor quality nails that peel and crack very easily.  But this product did nothing more than any of the many other &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It looks good and helps my nails to be strong.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Came in quick too.</li>
    <li> One of the best things I have found to help my nails from breaking or starting to tear from the sides. I will buy this product again for sure.  I do take vitamins that help the growth of my nails, but it wasn&#x27;t until I started using Rejuvacote that my nails pretty much stopped breaking all together.  Pleasantly surprised! I do keep a coat on pretty much all the time and continue to add another coat here and there when I do not have nail polish on. It is great to find a &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; product that actually made a noticeable difference for once.</li>
    <li> I have used Duri Rejuvacote Nail Growth System for 3 years with tremendous success.  My nails were thin and not growing well.  Duri gave me nails of envy and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Unfortunately, the product I just received is a watery version of the real thing. It doesn&#x27;t work the same.  I hope the company didn&#x27;t purposely alter the really fine product they had.</li>
    <li> have previously tried many products but nothing would help me grow nails.  They kept peeling &amp; breaking. Since trying this product, I now have beautiful nails.  I love  it.</li>
    <li> I had the kind of nails that you bump the wrong way and your nail breaks and pops off. The kind that pealed when I was trying to file them.  This product was recommended by a friend when I complimented her on her nails. I have to agree they turned my sofy and brittle nails into once I am really proud of and love to have polished. excellent product and the only product that I&#x27;ve ever used that has delivered far in excess of what I expected.</li>
    <li> It works so well, its a dream!!&lt;br /&gt;I used to have acrylic nails and it ruined my natural ones for YEARS, until someone told me about Duri. This stuff is so amazing that now my nails are long and gorgeous (which they were never were... even before acrylics). Literally, I recommend this stuff to all of my girlfriends, all the time, and I have been doing so for years. PLEASE, if you want gorgeous, strong nails, buy this stuff.. its worth its price 1 million times over!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite some time now and I love the results. My nails are finally really beautiful and long.... However, do not wait until the polish starts getting clumps and hard to apply it doesn&#x27;t work as well during this time and its messy as well... have always back ups... Enjoy Ladies you won&#x27;t regret it....</li>
    <li> My nails were destroyed by shellac nail polish and this product is bringing them back. I have tried other products, but this is the only one that works.</li>
    <li> I ordered for my mother she loves it. The price right. Almost half the price of a brick and morter store.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best nail hardener. Especially useful after removal of acrylic nails. I used faithfully after very thin nails for a month and nails are now hard, long and healthy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that works</li>
    <li> Very good produkt! Exactly like they are saying : from dying nails to nails you will die for. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great nail strengthener. My nails seem to be growing!  And the product does not chip or peel even after a few coats.  I love the shine too.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE NAIL GROWTH SYSTEM. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle &amp; I absolutely love how long my nails have grown. The only down side is how easy it chips off &amp; the glossy look. But the fact that it has made my once brittle nails healthy and growing out weights anything.</li>
    <li> The product really works</li>
    <li> I have nails that peel so I did 3 things. 1use this on my nails as a base coat. 2 stop using acetone to remove polish 3 wear gloves when washing dishes.  My nails were able to grow long without peeling.  Awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> HAS MUCH IMPROVED MY FINGERNAILS.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best stuff for growing nails.</li>
    <li> Like this product. It dries very fast.One bottle last a long time. I use it once per week.</li>
    <li> Using this product for almost 6 months. Really can see how my nails become better. Nails don&#x27;t exfoliate anymore. Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Getting 2nd one</li>
    <li> I chose this product on the recommendation of another.  I followed instructions for 2 weeks and saw little improvement.  My nails were protected against cracking but not splitting.  Have to look elsewhere for a solution to brittle nails.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuvacote for about a year now and it is the best nail product I have ever used, and I have tried them all.  My nails are strong, natural and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have recommended it to several girlfriends and they all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia Roberts Rice&lt;br /&gt;Camarillo, CA</li>
    <li> love this. my nail salon had it and has been using on me so I decided to buy for myself. anyone who has issues with thin and brittle nails that break. use this stuff and within a few days you can tell a difference!</li>
    <li> ...and I&#x27;ve owned a LOT.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to help my brittle, thin, peeling, splitting nails, and nothing has ever worked.  Rejuvacote is not an overnight miracle, but after 6 weeks, I can&#x27;t believe that these are MY nails!!  They&#x27;re longer and stronger than they have ever been.  The product does not last like a heavy duty top coat would, but you&#x27;re supposed to reapply it daily.  When it&#x27;s started to chip too much, I remove all the polish and start over.  I&#x27;ve used it as a base and top coat for when I wanted a color on my nails too.  Try this product and stick with it.  You&#x27;ll see results and won&#x27;t know how you ever didn&#x27;t have this little miracle in your life!!</li>
    <li> i have very brittle nails and they never grow. this product seems to be working. they are stronger and having less splitting</li>
    <li> I have a nail that splits into layers and used this product on it for many weeks, but there was no change.  The product is fairly strong, but won&#x27;t do miracles on your nails, so make sure you have realistic expectations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  not really working.  I had previously, about  a year or so ago, ordered nail repair that was really good.  Unfortunately, after it was empty I threw the bottle away so I don&#x27;t know what it was  The last two have been a waste of money.  Is there any way you can tell what I ordered the first time?&lt;br /&gt;Tlhanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  been having trouble with a toenail I damaged. When the nail grew back it was very thin and splintered causing it to continue breaking below the nail bed line and therefore never fully growing back. I tried everything I could get my hands on to strengthen the nail with no success  until this product. I&#x27;ve seen stronger new growth within the first week than I&#x27;ve  seen in the past year. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I love Rejuvacote! I use it as a base coat with every manicure and my nails are strong and healthy. I only have a nail break about once a year (yes, I&#x27;m serious) since I started religiously using Rejuvacote. I try other base coats every once in a while and I find that they leave my nails worse off - this is my holy grail product.</li>
    <li> This product reduces dry nails and strengthens them against splitting and chipping.  It is the best product I have found for problem nails.</li>
    <li> Several years ago when I was on vacation I went into a beauty supply store and asked about a nail strengthening product. The sales lady suggested a few that I had used before that I felt did not really do very much. She then told me about Duri Nail Growth System which is very easy to use. That was four years ago and I have better nails than I have every had in my life. I use it all the time and have been so happy with it that I give it to all my friends whose nails are growing stronger since using this product. I give it the highest possible recommendation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for many years, and this stuff makes my nails grow super fast. Sometimes I wear it with opi nail envy to get stronger nails. Both are 5 star nail treatments.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, now 10 friends are using it. I ordered a dozen bottles and have shared all. Will order more for sure.</li>
    <li> Good product and service</li>
    <li> Use it every day as a topcoat....keeps my nails strong and prevents nail polish chipping. Have used it for years and enables me to have beautiful natural nails</li>
    <li> My nails are in better shape and stronger since I started using this Duri product every other day on my nails.</li>
    <li> It took a while to see it truly worked, after so many other products have not done much.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> This rejuvacote is so far so good. It puts a marvelous shine on your polish ( use duri polish, it&#x27;s the best) no chips yet. Hoping it will help my nails grow and not break. I&#x27;ll update later</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My nails grow so fast now that I have to have them trimmed each time I go to the nail salon, once a week!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;My nails were weak, peeling, breaking and just wouldn&#x27;t grow.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used all the expensive treatments to no avail. I had heard good things about this product and decided to give it a try. I never expected this to work. I use it as a basecoat under my polish. I could see a difference within a couple of weeks. My nails continued to improve until I ran out of the first bottle. It didn&#x27;t take long before my nails quickly reverted to peeling and breaking down to the quick. I tried a different product for a couple of months with no positive results. I went back to the Duri and am already seeing a big difference in my nails strength and length. I use won&#x27;t be without this again. I recommend this to anyone struggling with their nails.</li>
    <li> It is great.  I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This product works better than any I have tried</li>
    <li> I think this is helping smooth the ridges in my nails.</li>
    <li> This product works great! I had short, splitting, peeling weak nails. I have been using this for one month as instructed and my nails look great! No more peeling, nails. They are stronger and longer. Will never be without!</li>
    <li> I just started using about a week ago and can already see a difference!  My nails are actually growing and although one nail did peel, it grew back pretty fast!  I threw away all other nail grow suplliments! I will only use this!</li>
    <li> Nails look much better after using this product. The only problem is that it emits a strong scent (might be dangerous around small animals and children).</li>
    <li> Great product for your nails.</li>
    <li> very good product. meets my expections com pletly, i have recomended  it to friends who now use it. thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to buy my 2nd bottle of this and I just have to write about how great it has been for my nails.  I bought a bottle a couple of months ago based on the good reviews.  I was hesitant to spend almost $10 on yet another \\&quot;nail miracle\\&quot;, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  My nails have always been thin and break very easily.  As soon as my nails would grow, they&#x27;d break.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my nails have not broken at all, and are the longest they&#x27;ve ever been and look wonderful!  I can&#x27;t believe how nice my nails look!  They are so strong and healthy looking.  And, I must add that I&#x27;m a mom at home and I wash dishes all day long and my nails stay strong through it all and this polish stays on.  It really holds up through all of the dishwashing and cleaning I do.  Definitely recommend this if you have weak brittle nails!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have had weak and splitting nails for year of abuse and acrylic nails.  After using this daily for about 5 weeks, I have strong and growing nails....</li>
    <li> My problem nails have begun to grow.  I have shared it with friends who also have had trouble with splitting nails.</li>
    <li> Had problems growing my nails out due to medications.  Duri Rejuvacote solved that problem!</li>
    <li> I started using this product at the suggestion of my manicurist and would usually purchase it from Her.  One time they ran out so I decided to see if I could get it online.  I decided to try Amazon since I&#x27;m a Prime member and not only did they have it but it was much less expensive.  This product has been great for my nails.  I wore acrylic nails for 15+ years and decided to grow out my own nails.  It&#x27;s been two years now and my nails are strong.  Great product.  I use it as my base coat and as my top coat.</li>
    <li> I use this lack for more than 5 years.  It is the best solution for my nails. Thank you to Duri company.</li>
    <li> I wanted to write this review because I love this treatment!  I apply this as a base coat and then polish and finish with Seche Vite fast drying top coat.  Everyday I apply one coat of the Duri, and my manicure last ALL week with no chips and stays very shiny!  Almost like gel.  I recently purchased 2 more bottles.  I would give this a try even if you are scared that you will be allergic.  Just try it on one nail and wait overnight.</li>
    <li> Tips of nails kept chipping off!&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it, very dissapointed!</li>
    <li> this is a very good product. I asked a women at the gym what she does to have such beautiful natural fingernails and she told me about this product. She said a friend told her about it. She said try it and if you like it, tell others----I wouldn&#x27;t have nice nails with out it. I can say the same for myself. I have beautiful nails now.</li>
    <li> This product is a MUST have for anyone who cannot grow nails.  I have been using&lt;br /&gt;it now for about 2 years and my nails are beautiful.  People ask me all the time if they&lt;br /&gt;are acrylic and can&#x27;t believe they are my OWN.  All my friends have stopped getting their&lt;br /&gt;nails done and now use Rejuvacote.  This product has saved me so much money and&lt;br /&gt;my own nails are as strong as the acrylic.  This product was actually recommended by&lt;br /&gt;my manicurist and she is so mad she lots my business.  I suggest you also purchase&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;miracote&amp;#34;.  It is the &amp;#34;super fast dry&amp;#34; and really lives up to it&#x27;s name.  I LOVE both products!</li>
    <li> Using this product daily to get my nails healthy after wearing acrylic nails for years.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think I have use long enough but it appears to be offering strength and restoration to my nails...</li>
    <li> My nails were consistently breaking; with this product they rarely break.  Recommended it to my daughter...her oprinion same as mine.  I will absolutely reoder it!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 4 months and it has not improved my brittle nails at all. Any further suggestions!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for five years and my nails are strong and endure alot of housework without using gloves.</li>
    <li> I have nails that break and fold unless I put a coat of polish on every day.  Previously I always used NailTek 2, with god results.  It kept my nails together, but if I forgot it for a few days then my nails would all die back.  I decided to get this Duri Rejuvacote to try something new, and I am glad that I did!  Using this Rejuvacote, my nails are actually growing and staying thick!  I can even go a few days without polish when I take it off and then forget to put it on right away.  Definitely 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My nails were damaged after wearing acrylic nails for many years. I had them removed 5 years ago but my nails would break, would peel and not grow.  After reading the reviews I purchased it and after using it a few weeks I actually have nails with white tips. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> Came highly recommended and seems to be helping my nails !!</li>
    <li> After wearing acrylics for 30 years, I decided to go natural.....read up on Duri and decided to give it a try.....it&#x27;s been a few months, but my nails have been restored!  Even prior to acrylics, my nails would split and peel so I didn&#x27;t have much hope after 30 years of acrylics and gels, but it works!</li>
    <li> I have used Rejuvacote for years.  It&#x27;s the only way I can grow nails!  I can&#x27;t imagine life without it.</li>
    <li> For some reason, it hurts when I put it on my nails. I don&#x27;t know why so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> My nail technician recommended this product to help nails that had been severely damaged by years of gel and acrylic nail service. I had been left with tissue paper thin nails and they were so weak I was disabled. The peeling and the splitting began to repair within a week and 8 weeks later I had nail growth I consider normal. I will never have the strong nails I was born with - however this product brought me back to health.</li>
    <li> love it ! My nails are finally growing.</li>
    <li> This and the Duri Brush &#x27;n Go top coat are my absolute favorite nail products. When my nails are feeling dry, brittle, or weak from consistent manicures, I&#x27;ll take a &#x27;break&#x27; and wear only two coats of the Rejuvacote for a few weeks, and my nails will literally feel stronger and healthier. The combination of the Rejuvacote (base coat) and Brush &#x27;n Go (top coat) with color makes your manicure last and look fresh much longer.</li>
    <li> I used this as suggested, and after seven days I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my nails.  I guess it did help protect them during that week, but there was no improvement in their condition.</li>
    <li> They are very quick about sending their products. I really have has success using Rejuvacote to get my nails healthy after spending lots of money having gel nails applied every two weeks.  This product I would recommend and this company I would promote.</li>
    <li> It makes my nails strong so they don&#x27;t keep breaking. My manicurist told me about it and I love it</li>
    <li> Great for your nails!!</li>
    <li> Great for my nails.  My nails are long and strong.</li>
    <li> This is the best product. I do my nails every other day so Im always trying new stuff. This makes my nails hard. I did keep it on for 4 days and not one chip. I have never had that before!!!! It is my holy grail of hardeners. Just try it. Im telling you! And I didnt get the burning like some people did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time with my nails breaking and splitting and always a mess.  After using this product for about a month, my nails started to grow and for the first time I am happy with how my nails look.  I put a light coat on every night.  After a week, I take it off and start again.  After a few months, I can now put a coat or two on and use nail polish!</li>
    <li> Well I was watching a nail repair tutorial and she recommended this. It arrived earlyier than scheduled, so awesome. I&#x27;m wearing it right now and its great.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I paint my nails.  After being a nail-biter for years, Rejuvacote made my nails strong.  Even though my nails remain strong, I use Rejuvacote as a base coat every time I paint my nails to ensure strength.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This nail polish helped me grow my natural nails long &amp; strong.  When used according to directions, it works amazing.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> All my life, I thought I had terrible nails -- peeling and then breaking. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of nail strengtheners, including OPI Nail Envy, which gets a lot of love on blogs, etc., but none of them worked for me until this one. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is still searching for the right nail strengthener, especially if your nails are like mine, not soft but prone to peeling.</li>
    <li> a bit soon but hopefully it will as in the past</li>
    <li> Great love the product!</li>
    <li> My nails had been pealing and I could not grow my nails. After a few weeks of using Duri Rejuvavote I have nails I am proud of. Thank you</li>
    <li> Heard great things about this. It peeled off my brittle nails immediately. I attempted to keep applying coats but it looked like I was molting.</li>
    <li> My nails have been very strong since using this product.  My nail tech frequently tells me that my nails are so good they look like artificial nails.  I just wish it did not contain formaldehyde.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the greatest for keeping your nail polish on longer  Use it as a top coat and do it every 3 or 4 days and nail polish will last and last.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and works fast</li>
    <li> I had acrylic nails for about a month and before that I had been wearing gel on my nails. My nails were horrible. I started using Duri nail growth ifor about 2 weeks and can already see the difference. Excellent product😄</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. As long as you keep it up. My nails like to peel and this has stopped them from doing this and they appear to be getting stronger.</li>
    <li> I used this in college when my nails were getting brittle, and returned after a few years when my nails were looking crappy again.  I trimmed my nails down to about only 1mm of nail and started applying this once a day, for 7 days and then removing and starting over.  Amazing results after week 2.</li>
    <li> My nails are begining to look healthy and growing since I begin using it 2 weeks ago!&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I used it could feel the results of healthier nails.  Am loving it!</li>
    <li> Frist time in over 30 years - yes, 30 years -- I acutally have to CUT my fingernails. My nails were dry &amp; brittle.&lt;br /&gt; Have tried probably every nail hardener ever to come out on the market, This is the first product that is beyound fabulous-- place one coat on clean nails as your base coat, then a colored polish if you want to, then REJUVACOTE as my top coat. It dries VERY fast with a great shine.  Every night for the next 10 days, I place another coat.  Nails become hard as rocks-- FANTASTIC PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This keeps the color on my nails so much longer than other top coats. A friend had recommended it to me because she loved it. Try it - it works great!</li>
    <li> All I have to say is that it is my second time ordering Duri Rejuvacote.  It is the best stuff for strong, long and beautiful nails.  The price is excellent also. I always order two bottles and I gave one to my good friend and she already ordered more at Amazon.  Great product, great price, great service.</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of soft, splitting, ugly nails this product has them looking fabulous.  A neighbor recommended it.  I started using collagen at the same time I started using this product so I&#x27;m not sure which product has made this miraculous difference, but I apply it almost every day and it dries VERY fast.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK AND FLAKES IMMEDIATELY!  DON&#x27;T BELIEVE THE HYPE!</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used on my nails. I am a healthcare provider and my hands are in water and disinfectants a lot during the day, My nails take a beating but this product restored my nails and I am happy my dermatologist recommended it to me. Great product. People think I have my nails done but I don&#x27;t. They look like they have a french manicure is what they tell me. I love the look. So far so good, its still working after about a year or more of use.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product at first but the more often I used it and when combined with other methods to strengthen nails, I have changed my mind. It does work well as a nail strengthener.</li>
    <li> I must admit that at first when I read about Rejuvacote, I figured it was just another typical nail hardener.  But it&#x27;s not so at all.  I have had silk wraps and tips for about 20 years and decided that I had enough of it, but I was afraid that I&#x27;d never be able to let my nails grow as they would be too weak.  It turns out that my nails are stronger than they ever were before I had wraps and tips.  Rejuvacote definitely works.  I don&#x27;t know what ingredient makes it work so well, but my nails are not brittle or soft at all. I&#x27;ve been using Rejuvacote for about 10 weeks and my nails are \\&quot;rejuvenated\\&quot;.  I am thrilled with this product and plan on always using it.  I use it as a base coat and as a top coat when I have a manicure.</li>
