      <li>Great for tweezing in dimly lit areas!</li>
      <li>I love this light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so clear that you may see more than you want to see!  HA!</li>
      <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>so easy to keep in my toiletry case.</li>
      <li>/&gt;suction cup not all that strong but not a factor in the way I came to use it</li>
      <li>Received the Tweezermate lighted mirror and liked it at first.  </li>
      <li>Led light helps a lot and is so easy to carry...</li>
      <li>The mirror is light weight and the light is strong.  </li>
      <li>Light works well and shows every fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This little mirror is perfect.  </li>
      <li>This little mirror is great!!!!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best aide to young &amp; old eyes - a must for travel too.  </li>
      <li>Before 60 days the light stopped working and Tweezerman refused to refund or replace the item stating that:</li>
      <li>If the light bulb ever went out would like to know how to replace.</li>
      <li>I purchased this mirror in December 2013 and use it maybe once a week, as of now the light doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>Plus, you can sit somewhere comfortable regardless of the lighting and pluck away.  </li>
      <li>This would be a fantastic mirror if you could replace the battery.</li>
      <li>So you have to experiment with the positioning of the light to help you see whatever you&#x27;re wanting to see.  </li>
      <li>It has a light and magnifies.  </li>
      <li>The light you have to work with to get it to light the part of your face</li>
      <li>It arrived with a light that does not work.</li>
      <li>I attach it to my dressing table mirror and am hands free.  </li>
      <li>SO worth it trust me!</li>
      <li>The mirror is small but, it works great!  </li>
      <li>The light at the top is what really sets it apart.</li>
      <li>This mirror will be great for traveling--it works pretty good, guess my eyes are getting worse--still hard to see everything.</li>
      <li>The suction cups are cool.  </li>
      <li>not necessary if good lighting in room</li>
      <li>Did the whole deal over and over and over, opened a working one to make sure everything matched up, but still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I really liked the light at first, but seems to dim over time.</li>
      <li>My wife loves it for a quick face check.</li>
      <li>Idea of product is great after a few minutes of use light flickers.</li>
      <li>This makes it very easy to see what you are doing even in a dimly lit bathroom.</li>
      <li>The magnification is pretty huge and makes even peach fuzz look like a tree, but it serves the purpose.</li>
      <li>However, the light on the first one stopped working within 30 days, and within 6 months the suction cups broke off from the mirror.  </li>
      <li>This is a great little mirror.</li>
      <li>I really adore the light.</li>
      <li>The light makes it much easier for her to see when she is plucking her eyebrows.</li>
      <li>This mirror is ridiculously powerful.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>Too small...not useful.</li>
      <li>The older model of this had one large suction cup with worked much better, in fact I still have it and use it even tho the mirror cracked (my fault.)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This little mirror is great!!!!  I use it every single day.  Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s stocking stuffer at Christmas and she absolutely loves it. The light makes it much easier for her to see when she is plucking her eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I love this little mirror!  I got my brows waxed in November 2009 and bought this mirror the same day.  And I haven&#x27;t had to get my brows waxed since!  With it you spot all the little hairs you can&#x27;t see under normal light in your bathroom mirror.  Perfect for keeping your brows nice and neat!  Plus, you can sit somewhere comfortable regardless of the lighting and pluck away.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier and you will be too!!!</li>
    <li> My bathroom is dark, making it hard to see the finer hairs when I&#x27;m tweezing my brows.  And it&#x27;s small, so there is no where to stand or mount my larger lighted makeup mirror.  This little mirror is perfect.  The LED light casts enough light that I can really see what I&#x27;m doing, and the magnification really helps.  It sticks to the larger mirror without any problem. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. The light is not all that bright and is rather small and therefore illuminates a very limited area and at a limited angle since the light does not move at all. It&#x27;s pretty useful for plucking eyebrows which is really all I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Wow, this mirror is powerful!  The light makes it impossible to miss a single hair when plucking eye brows.  The suction cups are cool.  I attach it to my dressing table mirror and am hands free.  It&#x27;s so clear that you may see more than you want to see!  HA!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size and the magnification is perfect for tweezing. Frightening amount of detail really. The light is BRIGHT! Very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> This little mirror is amazing!  I am able to see all the hairs that I have missed from tweezing in the bathroom mirror.  The light is bright and I am able to see everything.  I actually like tweezing my eyebrows knowing that I have gotten every little extra hair!  The mirror is small but, it works great!  I recommend this mirror to everyone!!  *****</li>
    <li> This mirror is nice and compact for travel. The magnification is pretty huge and makes even peach fuzz look like a tree, but it serves the purpose.</li>
    <li> Received the Tweezermate lighted mirror and liked it at first.  Before 60 days the light stopped working and Tweezerman refused to refund or replace the item stating that: \\&quot;The Lighted Tweezers is discontinued and we no longer carry it.&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons we discontinued this model was related to the light issues.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all I can say is look elsewhere if you want a product that the seller stands behind.  Sad that this company soesn&#x27;t stand behind their products.</li>
    <li> Delivers as described!  Note--the light is a small, single light on one side, not a light around the circumference of the mirror.  So you have to experiment with the positioning of the light to help you see whatever you&#x27;re wanting to see.  Also note that the mirror is small.  The suction cups work great, so repositioning the light to have it shine on a new spot is a bit of a hassle, but it does the job!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my Wife and she loves it for tweezing.  If the light bulb ever went out would like to know how to replace. Or just buy another one. Great for traveling and just the right size for those small areas you can not see with regular mirror.</li>
    <li> The magnification is not good.  The light is ok, but the whole thing is smaller than described.  I would not recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and portable. Can stick to mirror or surface. Light is nice but it&#x27;s hard to see spots because the light is small and the mirror is kinda small too. Wouldn&#x27;t have this be my main mirror to tweeze. Go for travel</li>
    <li> i bought this for one daughter and she loved it.  the other one loved it so much she bought one for herself!</li>
    <li> itis a great item. I use it to pluck my eyebrows and let me tell you it will show you hairs you didnt know existed!!! SO worth it trust me!</li>
    <li> This mirror is functional and stick on well to any surface.  It is TOO DARN SMALL</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine, but the light is USELESS. It does nothing to make your face easier to see in dim rooms - not at all worth the cost. Save yourself the extra money and just buy yourself a 10x hand mirror for $5.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and too small causing too much visual distortion. Virtually unusable.</li>
    <li> The tweezerman lighted mirror is good for traveling since it is quite small but the built in light makes it convenient.</li>
    <li> liked it so well I ordered more as gifts</li>
    <li> I really liked the light at first, but seems to dim over time. Not really good for the use of makeup application due to the size and magnification. I needed it for exactly the names purpose, tweezing. Oh and the 3 small suckers that come with the backing so you can affix it to surfaces was a joke. It affixes to nothing. So it does the job well for purpose it was intended.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to use at the gym, after I shower, to put on make-up if I have to go someplace directly.  The light is okay, and there&#x27;s a little distortion, but not too much.  It varies according to how close I am to the mirror, so you have to adjust your position.  I wish it had a little stand like on a table top picture frame so I could stand it on the counter while using two hands to apply eye make-up.  But, as a person who wears glasses, I needed something that magnifies, and the size is convenient to just keep in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> The mirror would have been ok if the suction cups worked. Two of the three suction cups were folded making it impossible to stick onto any smooth surface. In fear that it&#x27;d fall and break, i have decided to return the item. The magnification and light seemed to work fine, but you&#x27;d have to be about 2 inches from the mirror in order to avoid distortions since it&#x27;s so small.</li>
    <li> awesome mirror....sadly I haven&#x27;t noticed all this fine hairs until now</li>
    <li> This mirror really doesn&#x27;t give me the same feeling as what I saw in the picture.  I&#x27;m very disappointed the portion with the light doesn&#x27;t more.  I broke it because I just knew it had to move.  So you sit in on the mirror or whatever and that&#x27;s all.  No various angles or anything.  It&#x27;s not what I was expecting but may work for others.</li>
    <li> I lived out of country this year and could not take my vanity mirror with me. I am of the age to need reading glasses so a magnifying mirror is a great help in applying makeup. I wore makeup daily while abroad so as not to be a sloppy American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold in one hand while working on eyes&lt;br /&gt;good amount of magnification&lt;br /&gt;light not necessary if good lighting in room&lt;br /&gt;battery operated so no power adaptor/converter necessary for overseas use&lt;br /&gt;good price on Amazon vs same product in UK stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;takes a little getting used to how to hold while applying mascara but soon easy to hold and apply at same time&lt;br /&gt;suction cup not all that strong but not a factor in the way I came to use it</li>
    <li> Nice lighted mirror. I had it adhered to my mirror in the bathroom, came home one day, and it was on the floor, broken. After having it about a month I&#x27;m out the cost of the mirror plus get seven years of bad luck!</li>
    <li> The mirror still works, and the light still works, however the light can only be used if I&#x27;m pressing my finger into the little hole/switch. My hand then gets in the way of the light and therefore it doesn&#x27;t work great anymore.  I broke down and ran to Target and bought one there. I think it was a little more money but at least I can take it back if it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with this I was very disappointed. It is so small hard to see in it to pluck my brows which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> I am 52 and starting to need reading glasses. This tool is a lifesaver. The light is great and the magnification helps you to see the tiniest objects that get in your eye. We put one in each car and one in the house. My wife loves it for a quick face check. It reveals a lot, so get ready for the truth!</li>
    <li> When the light is on it is so bright that you can&#x27;t even see your reflection without burning a hole in your retina. But, great mirror with the light off!</li>
    <li> Never have I been able to see so many eyebrow hairs that need plucking. This mirror is awesome, and the light makes it even better.</li>
    <li> Absolutely PERFECT for eyebrows.  You can see hairs you&#x27;ve never been able to see in a regular mirror or with regular light.</li>
    <li> Excellent piece of multiple uses. Led light helps a lot and is so easy to carry...</li>
    <li> This is a great little mirror. Image is clear and truly 10x magnification. The light at the top is what really sets it apart. This makes it very easy to see what you are doing even in a dimly lit bathroom. Very small (maybe 4 inches?) so easy to keep in my toiletry case. I find it works really well if you just lay it flat on the bathroom counter and lean over it to tweeze.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations!  Very good price.  Light works well and shows every fine hair.  Shipped very quickly. Would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product for tweesing my eyebrows. It sure beats my long used method of holding up a flashlight with a magnifying mirror. Good lighting and fits in your hand well. Great for eyebrows or dealing wiht skin blemishes. I would highly recommend this product. Conveinent for traveling too!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for grooming eyebrows. The light helps identify little hairs. The only issue is that the suction cups don&#x27;t hold that well when I placed them on my mirror. After three weeks, the mirror fell down and cracked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to take off a star or two for showing what my skin really looks like, but it&#x27;s not their fault that the mirror works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Too small and it doesn&#x27;t stick!</li>
    <li> The light doesn&#x27;t last very long and you can&#x27;t replace the battery. I purchased this mirror in December 2013 and use it maybe once a week, as of now the light doesn&#x27;t work at all. This would be a fantastic mirror if you could replace the battery.</li>
    <li> Idea of product is great after a few minutes of use light flickers. That&#x27;s the only problem I found with product</li>
    <li> This lighted mirror is junk, not worth 3 cents. The light actually shines into your eyes so you are blinded. totally useless product..</li>
    <li> This mirror will be great for traveling--it works pretty good, guess my eyes are getting worse--still hard to see everything.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel mirror and provides ample light for inserting contacts or putting on makeup. The suction cups allow mounting to an existing mirror or fixture.</li>
    <li> The light on this is teeny-tiny - it is really hard to see what you&#x27;re doing with it.  The suction cups are fairly useless; they come unattached pretty easily.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this; instead just invest in one of those bigger lighted magnifying mirrors that stand on the countertop.</li>
    <li> After about two weeks of using the mirror once or twice a day for maybe 5 to 10 minutes each time, the light started flickering on and off, and in some cases doesn&#x27;t even come on at all unless I tap the mirror against a hard surface. The mirror was inexpensive enough for me to not want to hassle with returning it, but overall I am not impressed.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best aide to young &amp; old eyes - a must for travel too.  Bought one for my friends - a no special occasion gift!</li>
    <li> Please note that this mirror is only 4.4 inches across.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was so small.  I bought it to replace my lighted mirror on a stand after that broke, but this is too small to use for much more than plucking eyebrows. There is one small light dot at the top which it a little useful, but not much.  This would be good for travel and I&#x27;ll keep it, but I&#x27;m going to buy another big one on a stand.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my car and use it often.  It has a suction cup that allows it to stick onto just about any surface.  It has a light and magnifies.  It&#x27;s perfect for on the go, and it&#x27;s a Tweezerman, so the quality is  great.</li>
    <li> This is great for travel - easily suctions to any mirror.  Light is just enough to meet the needs.  Used it every day of my vacation for putting on eye makeup.</li>
    <li> The mirror is light weight and the light is strong.  It is kinda small but the magnification makes up for the size. The light you have to work with to get it to light the part of your face you are working on.  Only real complaint is that I am noticing a lot more hair that I need to pluck now. lol</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this little mirror at all.  It works well, the light doesn&#x27;t really kill your eyes while letting you see your eyebrows well enough to pluck them.  The only issue I have with it is the size.  It&#x27;s too small for my needs, which I should have realized before purchasing it.  If you only want to look at a tiny portion of your face, straight in front of you, it should work quite well for you though.</li>
    <li> This is a handy well magnified mirror. Lighting is crisp and clear. I bought a few more for travel etc.</li>
    <li> wife is happy with mirror</li>
    <li> Unreliable.  I have ordered two of these.  In concept, it is a good product; my wife loves it.  However, the light on the first one stopped working within 30 days, and within 6 months the suction cups broke off from the mirror.  It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, however, and so I bought another.  It arrived with a light that does not work.</li>
    <li> It was small enough to attach to my make-up mirror which only had 7X magnification.  The 10X magnification is a big difference.  There was a sticker that said remove tab and the tab is very well hidden - - as soon as the tab was removed the light worked.  And it is now stuck in place.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes excellent products.  Reliable and long lasting.  I have never been disappointed by any of their products.  Love that it is lighted.</li>
    <li> Too small...not useful.</li>
    <li> As others have pointed out, there is only a very tiny area that you can see in full focus. The light is also pretty feeble, and hard to get the right angle for it to be helpful. I was using it more or less successfully anyway, but then one of the little suction cups snapped, and it doesn&#x27;t stay put very well with the 2 remaining ones. In fairness, I was taking it out and sticking it onto a larger mirror when I needed it, rather than keeping it in place permanently. So it was sometimes hard to get it unstuck, and I probably wasn&#x27;t very gentle with it. But it broke after only about 6 months, so I looked for a better solution. Although it costs more, I ended up getting this: Floxite Daylight Cosmetic Mirror, 10 x Mag. This little one might go in my travel bag from now on.</li>
    <li> My mom and aunts love this purse magnifying lighted mirror! It&#x27;s their best friend and is really useful although a bit high on the price range for my taste!</li>
    <li> Just the right size if you are going traveling</li>
    <li> I love this light. When I get a cat hair or eyelash in my eye I can find it perfectly. But I tried to change the batteries on one of the three I have the other day and even though they were new batteries and lighted up when I was re-assembling it, once assembled it didn&#x27;t work. Did the whole deal over and over and over, opened a working one to make sure everything matched up, but still didn&#x27;t work. Cheaper in the long run to just get another one........I really adore the light. I have two cats who shed alot and the hair gets in my eyes when I pet them and I often have a stray lash in my eye, when I&#x27;m outside and it&#x27;s windy or whatever. So it&#x27;s perfect for that. I just wish the battery replacement wasn&#x27;t so difficult....finding the right screwdriver is a trial, as well.....</li>
    <li> Mirror is okay but the light is horrible. Not bright AT ALL!  Also, a week after getting it, the light piece completely fell off and won&#x27;t go back on.</li>
    <li> I bought one a long time ago and  love it! My co worker needed  a mirror,so I handed it to her...she was blown away by the clarity of the magnification,so decided to give as a Christmas gift...I know she will love it!</li>
    <li> the mirror quality is good - but hard to focus unless the item is very close (lip and brow are fine, but neck is hard to see).  The light is very weak and doesn&#x27;t really illuminate much.</li>
    <li> It is everything advertised. Quality magnification with clear image. Light is bright. Would rate a 5-star if the mirror was bigger.</li>
    <li> Very small and the light breaks off easily.  Do not recommend it!</li>
    <li> This mirror is ridiculously powerful. The first time I looked at my eyebrows in this mirror I was shocked!! When the heck did I start growing fine dark hairs all around my eyebrows!!! Well apparently I never saw them until now. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else saw them and giggled about it after I left or what. Hence the love-hate relationship with this mirror. I love the fact of how awesome the mirror works but hate what I&#x27;m seeing. Okay, I&#x27;m over 40 and never needed cheater glasses, or so I thought. Buy this mirror and be prepared to pluck, pinch, scrape or whatever. Oh, don&#x27;t forget to look at your chin, you never knew you had black hairs there either.</li>
    <li> Love this i bought one if these at ulta and it ran out of batteries. its a miracle i found it again. only mirror that works for me</li>
    <li> Great for tweezing in dimly lit areas! Only have 4 stars bc the light does create some shadowing on face, but it does the job well enough.</li>
    <li> I like the mirror even tho the light doesn&#x27;t last forever, but the suction cups have all ripped off rendering the mirror kinda useless given that I bought it to stick on my bathroom mirror.  The older model of this had one large suction cup with worked much better, in fact I still have it and use it even tho the mirror cracked (my fault.)</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and as described.  Just what I wanted.</li>
