      <li>This replacement doesn&#x27;t work quite as good as original -</li>
      <li>This was a great buy works really well</li>
      <li>The interesting part of that conversation is after I explained the nature of the problem</li>
      <li>If the drain hole clogs then it will flood or leak (which is probably the cause of many of the problems people complain about).  </li>
      <li>so just blew out the passages from the top and below.</li>
      <li>what more can be said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works OK, but I have to fiddle with the shaver each time I put it in to get it to work</li>
      <li>you notice, many of the comments below indicate that they are &amp;#34;replacing every two years.&amp;#34;  </li>

      <li>Bought a new cord and it works beautifully.</li>

      <li>Shaver can easily be cleaned under running water and then sprayed with electric shaver cleaning spray to disinfect and lubricate.  </li>
      <li>WORKS FINE.</li>
      <li>Once this is done, most of the time you can then just run a clean razor through the cleaning cycle twice, and it will clean out the drain holes.  </li>
      <li>It seems to clean just fine.</li>
      <li>Did not have my original receipt for the shaver nor did I &amp;#34;register&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I had the original for three years.  </li>
      <li>correct it, first clean the hair out of the part where you put the razor (the top of the unit).  </li>
      <li>Had the clean / charge unit replaced 4 times and warranty and paid for two after that..  </li>
      <li>There is a reason for this pattern; these Clean and Renew bases have always had issues with hair clogging them.  </li>
      <li>Keeps shaver clean and charged.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten five years of good service from my original - enough that I decided to purchase a replacement.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten five years of good service from my original - enough that I decided to purchase a replacement.  </li>
      <li>Daily use would be good for heavier beards.</li>
      <li>However, 5 years of use was not bad</li>
      <li>My husband was happy that he didn&#x27;t have to buy a complete new razor set and could just replace this unit.  </li>
      <li>I contacted Braun and received a quick response indicating that i have a 2 yr warranty and to bring the unit to an authorized location for servicing.  </li>
      <li>I went back to the source,  Very satisfied with this purchas.</li>
      <li>This version has been updated over my original and has the Fast Clean</li>
      <li>These are fairly expensive; unclogging it easily would be an excellent tutorial write-up for anyone that knows how.</li>
      <li>Super quick shipping, item exactly as described</li>
      <li>Normal cleaning performs four or more separate clean/rinse cycles while Fast Clean performs</li>
      <li>Worked great for a few months.  </li>
      <li>Amazing how the above state \\&quot;lasted 2 years\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>(ok I&#x27;m not a heavy user)</li>
      <li>Was nice while it last</li>
      <li>My husband was able to replace his old one.</li>
      <li>This device complements the faulty design and offers a refreshing experience every morning worth every penny.</li>
      <li>As far as im concerned a $1 bic plastic shaver does a better job then this.  </li>
      <li>He was absolutely right.  </li>
      <li>Still need to shave right?  </li>
      <li>Ariel is quite right - try cleaning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, don&#x27;t buy a 720-S because you really need this cleaning system to keep the head clean.</li>
      <li>This is simple, easy, and quick.</li>
      <li>Ariel, just saved $75 or more, and it took about ten minutes!</li>
      <li>Does exactly as advertized.</li>
      <li>this one, I have to make sure it&#x27;s seated correctly, or else i come back</li>
      <li>and I am hoping for a positive resolution from them...</li>
      <li>So my title for this review pretty much stands.  </li>
      <li>I usually first wipe it out with a damp paper towel, and then gently rinse it in the bathroom faucet.  </li>
      <li>When the drain hole gets completely clogged and/or covered by hair, then the unit won&#x27;t clean very well and will start to leak --</li>
      <li>Great device , it´s very hard to get without purchasing shaver also.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only problem, otherwise it works pretty well to clean and rinse your shaver.</li>
      <li>Braun should work harder to produce  products with greater longevity.  </li>
      <li>Unless you have a truly defective unit, you probably don&#x27;t really need to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has turned out to be a very costly purchase.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
      <li>Run it after every shave even if you don&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
      <li>The dealer was very knowledgeable and told us it is probably the cord.  </li>
      <li>Frankly, the drain hole should be much</li>
      <li>Much easier and cheaper than buying a whole new unit!</li>
      <li>I currently have a 740s after I dropped and broke my original 760CC.&lt;br /&gt;+  </li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m just stuck w/two clean &amp; charge units - neither of which works properly. . .</li>
      <li>Keep it clean and the drain hole open</li>
      <li>If you stick with using Braun Clean and Renew fluid</li>
      <li>Keep it clean and the drain hole open</li>
      <li>If you choose normal cleaning (large button) you do not choose from the 3 cleaning levels - it does that by itself.  </li>
      <li>You only select between normal cleaning and Fast Clean.  </li>
      <li>and you should get good service from it as well.erforms only one slightly extended cycle.  </li>
      <li>Beware, there is a small rectangular cove on the inlet, it flew out and luckily I saw it and it was easy to reinstall.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>this is a great shaver cleaner, this keep my shaver sharp clean and oiled, has a sensor for dirt , level of clean fluid and of course charge the shaver at the same time, some people complains about this cleaner clogs around the 2 year mark, maybe i will use a paper clip to clean the small drain for it , or i just clean it with a small brush if that happens , anyway</li>
      <li>However, I noticed a considerable amount of hair falling into the basin during shave and realized my shaver cannot hold the debris in the blade as much as the Panasonic shaver (which I owned before Braun).</li>
      <li>So the gist of this rant is...if you need to buy this product purchase it from another supplier, who hopefully has a few more scruples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Oh, there might be other ways to clean it too, but that&#x27;s too much bother for me.</li>
      <li>Purchased as a replacement for the one that came w/a new 799cc-6 shaver.  </li>
      <li>Could have included a new electric cord for the price.</li>
      <li>So that is $6 a month, just bought a new shaving head $27.  </li>
      <li>I see new ones with shavers for $160.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>For the price it should come with a new power cord, but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great replacment part</li>
    <li> Bought the razor from Amazon, when the base unit needed replacement after four years usage I went back to the source,  Very satisfied with this purchas.</li>
    <li> I bought Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver on May, 2008 so it has been just over 2 years and I&#x27;ve been noticing the cleaning function of the base unit to slightly decrease lately.  Finally in the last few days, when I pick up the shaver from the charge unit to use, it&#x27;s soggy and all wet.  It seems the dry function is not working at all.  I peeked inside the unit where shaver&#x27;s head goes in, it&#x27;s flooded with the cleaning solution.  To me, this is unacceptable.  The base unit should last much longer than 2 years.  I bought new base unit and all problems I&#x27;ve been having went away.  So guys be aware, in addition to buying cleaning solution and shave foil, the base unit also has to be replaced every 2 years.  This shaver may work great but is it worth it to spend this much to shave?  I am pissed...</li>
    <li> Worked well while it lasted 2 yrs. Too expensive to replace.  Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it for me to replace.    Shaver can easily be cleaned under running water and then sprayed with electric shaver cleaning spray to disinfect and lubricate.  Would have bought a new base unit if it was for max $30.    5 stars for functionality.  2.5 stars for short life and expensive replacement.</li>
    <li> The Braun base unit works pretty good, but it will clog up.  There are very small holes where you put the shaver in and over time, these get gooked up with hair and dirty cleaning fluid.  Usually you can just stick something small in there and unclog it and run the cycle a few times to clean it out.  That&#x27;s the only problem, otherwise it works pretty well to clean and rinse your shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband was happy that he didn&#x27;t have to buy a complete new razor set and could just replace this unit.  It works great and he is happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> My base is not moving the solution up anymore! Yes, very poor quality!I will call Braun but its been....wait a minute.....2 YEARS!! just like everybody else! Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this base unit from a parts house online and not via Amazon for the simple reason being that if you spend just a little bit of time comparison shopping then you can find a wider range of prices and save a few dollars.  My original Braun 760CC came with a Clean and Charge base, and after 5 years the heating element died.  Although my original base would still clean my razor it would no longer dry it - and even after a few days of sitting the interior of the razor cassette would still be wet.  However, 5 years of use was not bad so I can&#x27;t complain too much.  Here are my personal observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+  This version has been updated over my original and has the Fast Clean option.&lt;br /&gt;+  Works with all 7-Series Braun electric shavers (720-799).  I currently have a 740s after I dropped and broke my original 760CC.&lt;br /&gt;+  If you use the regular cleaning cycle, it will auto select the amount of cleaning your razor needs (three levels).&lt;br /&gt;+  Keeps your razor handy and fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;+  It does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-  You must pay attention to hair clogging up the drain hole in the bottom of the razor well.  If the drain hole clogs then it will flood or leak (which is probably the cause of many of the problems people complain about).  Frankly, the drain hole should be much bigger.&lt;br /&gt;-  It does take up a bit of room on your bathroom counter and needs to be near a plug.&lt;br /&gt;-  For the price it should come with a new power cord, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;-  It isn&#x27;t quiet, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;  If you stick with using Braun Clean and Renew fluid then it can get pricey - I recommend buying in bulk if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;  When you put in a container of cleaning fluid, do not move the base around too much or knock it over or it will spill.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;  You only select between normal cleaning and Fast Clean.  If you choose normal cleaning (large button) you do not choose from the 3 cleaning levels - it does that by itself.  Normal cleaning performs four or more separate clean/rinse cycles while Fast Clean performs only one slightly extended cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have found that this base works well and I&#x27;ve gotten five years of good service from my original - enough that I decided to purchase a replacement.  Keep it clean and the drain hole open and you should get good service from it as well.erforms only one slightly extended cycle.  Overall, I have found that this base works well and I&#x27;ve gotten five years of good service from my original - enough that I decided to purchase a replacement.  Keep it clean and the drain hole open and you should get good service from it as well.</li>
    <li> I have only had the shaver for a couple years and the base has stopped working.  It is very disappointing that after all the money spent on the unit, new heads and cleaning solution, that this unit has stopped cleaning.  It has turned out to be a very costly purchase.  When it was working it did a great job - although it does make alot of noise during operation.</li>
    <li> Product delivered timely - performs as advertised.  Braun should work harder to produce  products with greater longevity.  You&#x27;re a captive audience if you invest in their very  expensive shaver, only to be required to replace this expensive base station after a relatively  short period of time.</li>
    <li> Amazing how the above state \\&quot;lasted 2 years\\&quot;.  Well mine was no different.  The unit was not cleaning well and it started to leak.  Also noticed fluid remaining inside when i removed the razor.  I contacted Braun and received a quick response indicating that i have a 2 yr warranty and to bring the unit to an authorized location for servicing.  First off they built the units to last only two years so now it is out of warranty but secondly what do you do in the meantime if and when you bring the unit to be serviced?  Still need to shave right?  I am very disappointed considering the dollars spent on the unit itself along with all the refills.    Here&#x27;s my solution.  Pour some rubbing alcohol in a container, put a few drops of lubricant in with the alcohol, run the razor in this solution for a while.  I&#x27;ll see how this works.</li>
    <li> MY FRIEND LIKED IT AT XMAS</li>
    <li> Well after 2 1/2 years the base unit stopped working.  I tried flushing it out as didn&#x27;t want to pay the $60 for a new base cleaner.  Now the price has jumped to $123 So this has over priced itself.  I see new ones with shavers for $160.&lt;br /&gt;  The clean liquid only will last me 35 days and that is only shaving maybe 7 times a month.  So that is $6 a month, just bought a new shaving head $27.  Was nice while it last but what a huge disappointment!  As far as im concerned a $1 bic plastic shaver does a better job then this.  I never liked the way it pull hairs once it was about 6 months old.  BIG mistake buying this shaver as the money drain is endless!  Maybe join the shaver of the month club!  Good Luck and DONT BUY!</li>
    <li> WORKS FINE. YOU SHOULD OFFER THE CORD NEEDED TO OPERATE IT, IN CASE THE BUYER DOES NOT HAVE ONE. I DID</li>
    <li> Ariel is quite right - try cleaning. I have an air compressor so just blew out the passages from the top and below. Beware, there is a small rectangular cove on the inlet, it flew out and luckily I saw it and it was easy to reinstall.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Ariel, just saved $75 or more, and it took about ten minutes!</li>
    <li> When we bought this item and tried it out it didn&#x27;t work.  Contacted Amazon and the dealer.  The dealer was very knowledgeable and told us it is probably the cord.  He was absolutely right.  Bought a new cord and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> this is a great shaver cleaner, this keep my shaver sharp clean and oiled, has a sensor for dirt , level of clean fluid and of course charge the shaver at the same time, some people complains about this cleaner clogs around the 2 year mark, maybe i will use a paper clip to clean the small drain for it , or i just clean it with a small brush if that happens , anyway I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Although the design of the base unit seems flawed, this part, although a different color, is a suitable replacement for the silver and white bases I&#x27;ve had over the previous years for the Braun 9000 Series (now known as Series 7). I agree that they seem to last about two years. These are fairly expensive; unclogging it easily would be an excellent tutorial write-up for anyone that knows how.</li>
    <li> It seems to clean just fine. I don&#x27;t know how to select the different cleaning degrees though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Braun 720-S that didn&#x27;t come with this cleaning system. I thought I could just rinse out the head after every shave. That worked for about 3 months then the 18 month head quit cutting. I bought a replacement head. I also dismantled the old head and found that rinsing was only cleaning out the middle third of the head. The outer two thirds were jammed solid with tiny bits of hair cemented together with natural facial oil. So, it wasn&#x27;t the head that was bad, but the cleaning method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t buy a 720-S because you really need this cleaning system to keep the head clean. Oh, there might be other ways to clean it too, but that&#x27;s too much bother for me. This is simple, easy, and quick. It also isn&#x27;t that expensive, when you consider the option of buying a new head every 3 months.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement for the one that came w/a new 799cc-6 shaver.  The one that came w/the shaver did not work properly w/regard to fill level indicator for the cleaning cartridge.  Light would go from green to orange, then back to green for awhile, then back to orange - but, never to red - indicating a need to insert new cartridge.  I purchased this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; replacement clean &amp; charge base - and it did the same thing.  Thought maybe the problem was in the shaver itself - but, don&#x27;t see how that could be.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;intuitively&amp;#34; seem to me that the shaver has anything to do w/the functioning of the fill level indicator.  VERY frustrated.  Did not have my original receipt for the shaver nor did I &amp;#34;register&amp;#34; it when purchased so can&#x27;t send it back.  Plus, based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read re Braun &amp;#34;service&amp;#34; - it leaves a lot to be desired.  Now I&#x27;m just stuck w/two clean &amp; charge units - neither of which works properly. . .</li>
    <li> was just what I needed, it works great.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a few months.  Had the clean / charge unit replaced 4 times and warranty and paid for two after that..  Needless to say its now in the trash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my 10 year old Braun that sat in the closet for 4 years and still had a charge!</li>
    <li> Super quick shipping, item exactly as described</li>
    <li> this product is awesome, i&#x27;m glad I purchased it. it is a replacement for my old braun  pulsonic clean and charge base unit. it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Much easier and cheaper than buying a whole new unit!</li>
    <li> This replacement doesn&#x27;t work quite as good as original - It is a Braun -- is it refurbished? Is it just not the same? I don&#x27;t know... It works OK, but I have to fiddle with the shaver each time I put it in to get it to work, the original worked perfectly as soon as I placed it in each time. this one, I have to make sure it&#x27;s seated correctly, or else i come back and it hasn&#x27;t cleaned. But, yes, it is working so far, after a week of fiddling...</li>
    <li> Excellent.  It would be nice to have an instructions sheet</li>
    <li> Does exactly as advertized. Keeps shaver clean and charged.</li>
    <li> Trying to clean out the whiskers from the original base is worth trying first.  I did that, including using a paperclip to clear out the drain hole (located on one side of the place where the shaver sits to be cleaned).  However, my original base was just too old I guess.  It still leaked and malfunctioned after cleaning.  So this new base has worked great and is less expensive than re-ordering a brand new base and shaver combo.  I have replaced the head on the shaver before, so at some point in the future I may just re-order everything, but hopefully not for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my original base because after 3 years of use it stopped functioning.  I thought great I can buy one through Amazon.  Well, I purchased this in late October 2012 and it stopped functioning in early March 2013.  So for a ridiculous amount of money this unit only functioned for less than 5 months.  I contacted the seller and basically got \\&quot;we can&#x27;t do anything for you\\&quot;, I found this answer to be abhorrent!!!  I could understand if the product broke down after at least a year of use, but less than 5 months is obviously a defective item.  I have contact Amazon directly and I am hoping for a positive resolution from them...but I am not holding my breathe.  So the gist of this rant is...if you need to buy this product purchase it from another supplier, who hopefully has a few more scruples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followup on the above, as I thought Amazon couldn&#x27;t (or wouldn&#x27;t) do anything about this issue.  So I took their suggestion and contacted Braun directly.  The interesting part of that conversation is after I explained the nature of the problem the first statement out of the customer rep was \\&quot;Well Braun stands behind its products\\&quot;, the next thing was we can&#x27;t send you a replacement because this base unit is considered a part and not a product and is therefore not covered under any warranty.  My only option would be to send the defective product to their East Coast repair center in MA.  So my title for this review pretty much stands.  If you buy this base unit, or even a Braun shaver, and it is defective you will be most likely throwing your money out the window eventually.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy works really well and I&#x27;m very satisfied. .</li>
    <li> I initially purchased 720CC thinking clean &amp; charge unit is a luxury and is intended for lazy men who don&#x27;t maintain their gears regularly. However, I noticed a considerable amount of hair falling into the basin during shave and realized my shaver cannot hold the debris in the blade as much as the Panasonic shaver (which I owned before Braun). This device complements the faulty design and offers a refreshing experience every morning worth every penny. Run it after every shave even if you don&#x27;t have much hair. Don&#x27;t try to save on the solution if you want to maximize your shaving experience. There is a recipe for creating your own cleaning solution on the web to save you on the cartridge replacement.</li>
    <li> I should have bought the clean and clean base when I first bought the shaver.  It does an outstanding job of cleaning, drying and charging the shaver.  I use it every two days as my beard is not quite that heavy.  Daily use would be good for heavier beards.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps my Braun 790cc charged and cleaned, few things beat that lemon smell for a clean shave in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Power cable is bulky on the plug part leading to it sticking out and getting in the way</li>
    <li> Great device , it´s very hard to get without purchasing shaver also.</li>
    <li> Unless you have a truly defective unit, you probably don&#x27;t really need to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you notice, many of the comments below indicate that they are &amp;#34;replacing every two years.&amp;#34;  There is a reason for this pattern; these Clean and Renew bases have always had issues with hair clogging them.  When the drain hole gets completely clogged and/or covered by hair, then the unit won&#x27;t clean very well and will start to leak -- if you notice solution around the base unit after you run it, you most likely have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To correct it, first clean the hair out of the part where you put the razor (the top of the unit).  I usually first wipe it out with a damp paper towel, and then gently rinse it in the bathroom faucet.  Once this is done, most of the time you can then just run a clean razor through the cleaning cycle twice, and it will clean out the drain holes.  If you are still having trouble, then the drain holes themselves might be clogged; you could try a paperclip or something else to get the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I just saved you $50+ ... try this before you spend the money!</li>
    <li> It does the job its intended to do - what more can be said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturing quality is good; functionality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback would be the fact that it is not portable, but you just taken the mains/electric cable and that fits the razor so no issues there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had mine a couple years now - still running strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** NOTE  *** I charge/clean my razor once the battery is dead flat.  I never leave the power turned on to this unit as if you do, you will kill the razor&#x27;s battery.  I (on average) get up to 3 weeks usage from one charge (ok I&#x27;m not a heavy user) but if I were to leave the thing on constant charge the battery life would be significantly less thant it is now.  So I can travel without the worry of having to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same for virtually all battery powered products; it has been said that the new style lithium batteries do not attract a &#x27;charge cycle memory&#x27; however I disagree (from experience) and still charge fully - deplete fully before charging again (even my phones etc...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I just wish I did not have to replace these every 2 years. It&#x27;s the 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought. Why Braun? Why?</li>
    <li> Works like mine did when it was new.  Could have included a new electric cord for the price. I had the original for three years.  Hope this lasts as long</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having the same problem with occasional flooding/leaking of the cleaning fluid. My solution:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Unplug the base and open it&lt;br /&gt;B. Take out the cartridge and set it down&lt;br /&gt;C. Clean the well in the base with a cotton ball dampened with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;D. Ream out the drain hole in the base with a pipe cleaner&lt;br /&gt;E. Put it all back together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your drain/flood problems are over! 😃</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Just like the one before it.</li>
    <li> Works great. My husband was able to replace his old one.</li>
