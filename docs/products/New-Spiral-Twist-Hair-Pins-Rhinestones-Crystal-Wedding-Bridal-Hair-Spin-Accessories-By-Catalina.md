      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>They are exactly what I expected and wanted and for half the price of what was available in stores!</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say what the difference is, only that they don&#x27;t work well at all if you are using them for any sort of styling (and as noted, styling that other twists did easily).</li>
      <li>wish I could say exactly why by making a comparison, but all my other twists have been lost (hence ordering these)</li>

<li> They stayed in her hair all day long!</li>
<li> These can definitely be worn by a bride (they are high quality and not in the least flashy), but also for special occasions or for an additional touch to an everyday hairstyle.</li>
<li> The expected delivery date was after February 6.</li>
<li> They r what I expected</li>
<li> I ordered them in January 12 and received them today January 23, way sooner than I expected.</li>
<li> I thought I would have to give her present late, but worked out.</li>
<li> She braids her hair a lot and adds these for a little sparkle.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, every single one of them came so that the end of the wire was pressed against the rest of the twist.</li>

    <li> I love to put these in my hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE! They add sparkle and pizzaz to any hair do!</li>
    <li> Perfect for pageant hair!</li>
    <li> Wow!  These are gorgeous!  I bought them for my daughter&#x27;s dance competition.  They are truly beautiful.  Great Great Purchase!</li>
    <li> These hair pins are very pretty and the price is amazing!  I saw the same hair pins in the mall for triple the price and there were only 6 of them.  They are also very sparkly.  The middle stone is kind or irredescent and the surrounding stones are clear.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really want to love these. They are very pretty. Unfortunately, every single one of them came so that the end of the wire was pressed against the rest of the twist. I&#x27;ve been having to take pliers to pry them apart, and even then, they somehow don&#x27;t twist in very well. I&#x27;ve used spiral twists before to hold up strands of hair, and I just can&#x27;t do it with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say exactly why by making a comparison, but all my other twists have been lost (hence ordering these) so I can&#x27;t say what the difference is, only that they don&#x27;t work well at all if you are using them for any sort of styling (and as noted, styling that other twists did easily). Also, they catch the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, if you are ONLY using them to accent your hair and add some sparkle, don&#x27;t care about the catching, and don&#x27;t mind prying them apart, they are very lovely!</li>
    <li> After waiting for 30 days it finally delivered.&lt;br /&gt;Very LONG waiting period.</li>
    <li> They r what I expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using these for my wedding day hair! They are exactly what I expected and wanted and for half the price of what was available in stores!</li>
    <li> I bought these to wear at a wedding. Although they did not arrive in time for that event, they are very pretty and my granddaughters love these.</li>

    <li> These can definitely be worn by a bride (they are high quality and not in the least flashy), but also for special occasions or for an additional touch to an everyday hairstyle. I appreciate this kind of versatility. I was concerned - on account of the low price - that these may be on the gaudy side, but I was glad to be proved wrong when I got them in the mail. They are simply adorable and very well made. I did find that it was easier to twist them into my hair if I pulled on the last bend of the spiral which was a bit narrower than the rest - but that may have happened during shipping and you only need to do it once (it remains in the &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; position after that). The petal stones are transparent and the middle one has a polychrome sparkle that reminds me of Swarovski crystals. I highly recommend both this product and the seller!</li>
    <li> was a gift they liked them</li>
    <li> Got them 2 weeks earlier than expected! And perfect timing too before my best friend&#x27;s birthday. I thought I would have to give her present late, but worked out. So so happy with them! My friend loves them. She braids her hair a lot and adds these for a little sparkle. Looks really cute!</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE READ MY REVIEWS, YOU WILL SEE I HAVE PURCHASED A LOT OF THESE TWISTIES.  I LOVE THEM! LONG OR SHORT HAIR... THEY WILL BRIGHTEN UP YOUR DAYS OR NIGHTS! VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT AND SELLER.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and super pretty. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great price. I ordered these to go in my daughters hair on Halloween.  They stayed in her hair all day long!</li>
