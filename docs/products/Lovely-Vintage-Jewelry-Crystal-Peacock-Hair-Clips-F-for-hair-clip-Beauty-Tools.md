<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> beautiful and sparkly...can&#x27;t wait to wear it...</li>
    <li> These really surprised me. I figured for the price I would be getting junk. But I decided to order them any way. I have worn them a lot and I love them!</li>
    <li> Made well, its very pretty and I get a lot of compliments on it. it slides a little-but not much especially considering that my hair is kind of fine. Great product</li>
    <li> When I saw this on Amazon.com, I knew I had to have it! I love the colors of the Peacock (animal) &amp; when I saw this Hair Comb in person, it was stunning. The item arrived on time &amp; the packaging/protection was good. I have gotten lots of compliments, so I know you will too. I will order more from this Seller soon. I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Very bright and the colors are rich.  This is not flimsy; it is a strong, metal hair decoration that dresses up your hair with no fuss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Beautiful... Very pleased with price and quality of item. Arrived on time and in Awesome condition.</li>
    <li> Beautiful. The comb works really well.</li>
    <li> Beautiful comb.The picture does not do it justice.  Much prettier  in person</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but very heavy</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t resist getting this after randomly searching peacock things on Amazon. The price was too good to pass up, even though it shipped from China and took just under four weeks to get here. It&#x27;s a perfect &amp;#34;something blue&amp;#34; to wear in my hair for my peacock themed wedding (even though it&#x27;s not until next summer). I love how sparkly and well made it is. It is nice that it&#x27;s metal and you can bend the prongs if you need to.</li>
    <li> Just as shown!!!  A lovely heavy, nicely made jewelery hair piece!!!!  More Please!  Lovely!  It really gives my hair and my day little glamor, sparkle and fun!  Arrived early, and in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> It is very cute! I was on my honeymoon when the stone in the eye fell out so I just stuck it back with clear nail polish and it held up. The comb is a good heavy quality it wont break and the peacock is adorable!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wedding. It&#x27;s beautiful. It&#x27;s actually a comb which is ever better! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with the quality. Was also unable to open the clip at first. Shipping took forever and quality is below anything I have seen. Will never purchase from here again.</li>
    <li> The only down side is that it pulls your hair. You can not play with it as far as if you want to see if it looks nice at different angles  because when you take it out of your hair it pulls your hair.</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine hair and this comb holds it very well. The comb is curved and is comfortable!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it! It&#x27;s really beautiful!</li>
    <li> I adore this hair comb. It looks just like the picture. I had a little problems keeping it in my hair. But I have the curse of fine hair but a lot of it so I have problems keeping clips, pins and comb in my hair. But if you do buy it and you have fine hair of not a lot of hair, I do not suggest this unless you get some bobby pins to help hold it in place. Anyone with normal to thick hair this will be great for you.</li>
    <li> this is beutiful and well made my daughter loved it ,is very well made and i am very happy with this item</li>
    <li> Nice and cute! Was made with resistant materials. Excellent quality and price. I would recommend it. Highly recommended for long hair.</li>
    <li> This piece of jewelry for hair is well made, solid and beautiful.  I really could not believe I got such a great sturdy clip for the low price.  I only wish I had more occasions to wear it!</li>
    <li> It is absolutely gorgeous. The quality is better than I expected. It weighs 1.1 ounce. A little too heavy for a little girl but not a problem for adults or teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great too. Arrived earlier than told. Very carefully wrapped. Actually it took me a couple minutes just to open the little box! Have to report that one piece of crystal was loose in the bag when arrived but I don&#x27;t really mind because it&#x27;s hard to tell. It&#x27;s only $3+ after all.</li>
    <li> This is very pretty and well made, but it won&#x27;t stay in my hair.  My hair is somewhat thin.  It&#x27;s probably ok in thicker hair, but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Way to big to put in your hair! Not sure what to do with it.</li>
    <li> This came in even more beautiful than expected.  I love peacocks and this just fits the mart to a T.</li>
    <li> This comb is beautiful, but if you need it within a certain time frame, beware.  This particular accessory ships from Hong Kong, which I did not realize.  I ordered it three weeks before a ceremony I hoped to wear it to, but it took 5 weeks to arrive.  Upon arrival, the small package requires signature, so you need to be home or prepared to make a stop at the post office.</li>
    <li> okokokkvci love how the product match my hair..i hop some one will love as i likt it&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;by yx</li>
    <li> Beautiful peacock.  Some of my friends saw me take them out of the package and couldn&#x27;t stop oohing and aahing!</li>
    <li> These are very pretty hair clips and are a very good price compared to department store prices.  I got them for a favors for a peacock themed wedding.</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful piece I have ever seen. It has a heavy comb which will keep it from breaking. on dark hair this stands out and looks so elegant. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it took a long time to get. But I was not disappointed when I did.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is very beautiful. The colors are stunning. I will be ordering more of these to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful clip but it broke easily.</li>
    <li> Awesome. But does not remain on the bun...keeps slipping. But the beauty and neatness are incomparable. Overall I am happy I own it</li>
    <li> I thought the spikes were going to be the wire kind that get caught in your hair and pull it out, but its not. It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair or pinch when its in. I like it and I think it&#x27;s beautiful. Peacocks are awesome</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received this quickly and in a great package.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly hair and it stayed great and looked beautiful! When I am not wearing it I use it as a decoration, it is just that pretty!!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS SUCH A PRETTY ACCESSORY TO PLACE IN MY HAIR.  I HAVE RECEIVED MANY COMPLIMENTS SO FAR!  THANKS SO MUCH!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful, detailed clip, looks much more expensive than it looks.  It takes a while to be delivered, so need to order now if you want if by Christmas, but it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO WEARING IT FOR THE HOLIDAYS!!!! ONCE AGAIN, IF YOU LOVE BLUE AND PEACOCKS, BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this clip but I just cut my hair so I wont be able to wear it for awhile. Its very pretty and shiny though. The price was great as well. Prompt delivery as well and this one is also shipped from China.</li>
    <li> I purchased this since I wear my hair up every day in the summer.  I have received lots of compliments on it.  Very happy with my purchase and it came in the mail faster than I had expected!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty clip that stays firmly in my hair and goes well with the peacock earrings and necklace that I purchased. it was also a great price.</li>
    <li> It really is as bright and shiny as it looks in the photo! Mine was set on silver-metal instead of the gold-metal shown, but it still looks great. The color combination is refreshing and gives the piece a modern sort of elegance. It&#x27;s not too heavy and sits in my hair pretty well, which is oftentimes difficult because my hair is straight and rather fine. The design is easy to make out so that people can easily tell what it&#x27;s supposed to be, and goes well with a bun (e.g. the peacock is spread out in a curve to &amp;#34;hug&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;trace&amp;#34; the bun accentuating it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely one of my favorite peacock hair pieces, and a favorite hair ornament overall!</li>
    <li> i was surprised with the quality of the hairclip, because the price was so low, i expected a lighter, more plastic or cheaper looking hair clip, but it is actually pretty heavy, made of like a heavier metal, and the rhinestones are lovely and durable. basically it is worth getting for the price, because it is durable and super cute</li>
    <li> I purchased a few different ones and one is more beautiful then the other the colors are gorgeous and the price was so cheap thank you</li>
    <li> I like the looks of it and the &amp;#34;write up&amp;#34;. the sparkle.  The teeth of the comb are large, sharp, so plastic will not bend. I can&#x27;t use this hair clip at all. It hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think I will order that kind of product again.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t receive the Butterfly yet. Why so long?</li>
    <li> prettiest ive ever seen. took forever to get here but it was worth the wait. so in love with it cant wait to wear it. quality looks high end and beautiful shine</li>
    <li> Nice comb but looks better and bigger on the picture. I feel the peacock outline gets lost in a hairdo.</li>
    <li> Pictures do not do this justice. This is absolutely beautiful. I figured it would be like something from Wal-Mart but it is definitely NOT. This is a very well made product. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice and heavy..... Didn&#x27;t expect this much for such low price......Got the silver one.... Goes well with any dress.....</li>
    <li> these are the best hair clips I own now. I wear them literally every day. the reason for the lower star is the long wait but you feel the company cares about its product because it is sowell made. this is a fantastic item for the price. they are very beautiful and sturdy. If you can hang on for the verrrrrry long shipping time. for me it was worth the wait as I was not in a hurry. if you are thinking of them for gifts, they are super nice in that the jewels are good quality and well set they are quite sturdy suitable for long hair. but order early if this is for an event or gift. it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course.</li>
    <li> This Is very beautiful and the price is great, wasn&#x27;t sure what I would be getting when delivered it but I was very impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful peacock hairclips, well made and well-worth the price. The shipping was very fast and it took only 9 days to arrive in California from Shenzhen, China. The hairclip looks gorgeous on my hair and will make a perfect gift for girls or ladies.  I absolutely recommend doing business with your company and will purchase from you again.Thank you for the 5-star service and the 5-star products!</li>
    <li> very pretty, good use of complimenting colors, this is not a hair &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; as in headline part of ad, but is actually a 4&amp;#34; long metal comb, which works well for a hair twist or bun.&lt;br /&gt;You probably would need additional hairpins if your hair is thin or fine. My hair is fine, but thick and wavy, so it works for me. Thin, fine straight hair will need extra pins, then put this on top or side for finishing look.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful clip but the comb is very long and it is uncomfortable in my head. It&#x27;s probably a no problem for most people but for me, its a bit difficult to use. I am still keeping it and I will use it on rare occasions.</li>
    <li> This bejeweled hair clip is beautifully designed and crafted.  It seems sturdy enough to handle my hair on a windy day.  I was amazed by the value.  THANK YOU for it!</li>
    <li> VERY pretty, but I rather display it than use it. It&#x27;s itchy...every time. I don&#x27;t know what they use to make this but it makes our scalps itch like crazy. Wear it but not where it touches your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any metal sensitivities (such as to sterling silver) you may want to display this than use it, but if you do, don&#x27;t let it touch your scalp!</li>
    <li> The product is flimsy and I have not worn it as I worry about breakage. The quality is low and seems to be fragile. For something that I am going to put in my hair, I worry about it&#x27;s durability.</li>
    <li> The product arrived really fast. Exceeds my expectations, and what is even more amazing-- it works even on relatively thin hair. Thanks a lot for the nice service and excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful clip for the price</li>
    <li> When it came to me after normal wait... it was missing 9 stones first thing that were in the plastic bag, scattered around it... I was very sad...</li>
    <li> The piece is so nice looking! But it&#x27;s just so heavy that it slips on my hair after 1 minute.. It feels kinda heavy too in my head. They should have made it in a lighter material.</li>
    <li> this is truly lovey! Just that with my thin hair, it is heavy....luckily, may daughter loved it and wears it in her bun or ponytail!</li>
    <li> It was beautiful for my maid of honor</li>
    <li> Loved it!!! Was kinda nervous that it wasn&#x27;t gonna make it here by the time my wedding day was but it only took about 2 wks instead of the 4 wis to get it... only bad thing I can say is it was shipped in a bubble wrapped lined envelope where part of it poked through and the jewel that was there fell out... it only took some super glue to fixed it...</li>
    <li> The price is good. I love it.</li>
    <li> Holds my thick hair in place in numerous hairdos. Seems solid and sturdy. Wasn&#x27;t expecting much considering the small price, but I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The peacock is very pretty and large! The comb itself has long and very strudy teeth. It can handle thick hair very well. I would not recommend it for thin hair because it would be too heavy for thin hair and the teeth would show uip very easily.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin (less than 1\\&quot; thick ponytail), slippery-straight hair, and I can use this comb to hold up a bun without issue.  The textured comb teeth help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are lovely and crisp blue/teal/silver.  The metal seems really sturdy, especially since most combs like this are plastic.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair clip, more shiny than expected, and holds very well. I loved the variations of blue hues. I received compliments.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a haircomb like this for a long time. It slides into my hair with ease and stays in place. I will be ordering more of these for my friends and family members. I would recommend this to everyone. Very pleased, thank you for the fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> I love it looks really good</li>
    <li> beautiful.  fabulous color.  stays in granddaughters hair well.  I have got to stop buying things I need 3 of !!!!!!!  it would definitely increase the chances for a more peaceful atmosphere.</li>
    <li> Looks like vin tinge jewelry or brassy it has no color the way it shows in the picture, I don&#x27;t know how it will wear.....</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re very happy with the hair clip! It&#x27;s really beautiful and have an amazing quality.... It looks stunning in hair buns!</li>
    <li> This was a gift. Receiver seemed pleased.  Honestly it did not look as good as in the sales display</li>
    <li> Gave it to my sister on her wedding day. Something new and something blue. She put it in her bouquet. It was great.</li>
    <li> Beautiful..  great quality , I will order more, these would make great gifts.</li>
    <li> Love the colors!  I have gotten many complements</li>
    <li> I like this hair comb but before I even took it out of the plastic, a couple stones had already been missing.  Not too happy about it but it is pretty comb.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore.</li>
    <li> It will take up few weeks to arrive but for the price it&#x27;s def worth waiting for. Added this to my collection.</li>
    <li> I love the design and it is beautiful but the other comb that I ordered with this one, broke . I am afraid to wear it because it is made the same and the teeth are bent.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly, it is much better made then you would expect for the price.  It looks awesome in your hair.  and is very comforable in your hair</li>
    <li> It took a whole month to get here,  but it&#x27;s beautiful and very heavy. I mean like its a good quality!!  I will buy more because they are really worth the money and the time.</li>
    <li> great quality, very pretty</li>
    <li> cheap, looks great.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t use myself but give as gift to people who helps me on vacation.</li>
    <li> Pity, it could have looked lovely if the material used did not look so cheap and chintz.&lt;br /&gt;I waste of money.</li>
    <li> One word... GORGEOUS!</li>
    <li> Very pretty , got faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Crystal hair piece. This is a good size and works well for decoration.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really stay in my hair after I tuck it into my bun.</li>
    <li> Its exactly as in the picture, and is easy to put on. I love how it looks and so does my friends.</li>
    <li> A lovely well made hair comb.  Stays securely placed in hair.  Forks are metal, not plastic as most.  Highly recommend for yourself or gift.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I haven&#x27;t used it yet because my hair is still too short and I can&#x27;t wait until my hair grow as out so I can wear this beautiful hair clip.</li>
    <li> In love with it! I wear it best with a sock bun</li>
    <li> I only wore once and some crystals fell out. When I dropped it trying to take it out the metal design broke off of the comb. I am very upset about it. I would like a new one.</li>
    <li> As others have said it sparkles and the stones are well set and not likely to come out. I was very impressed with the placement of the colors of crystals and how well the comb stayed where I put it. The picture does not do it justice. A wonderful purchase and I look forward to wearing it many times.</li>
    <li> This comb is fabulous!! It took a very long time to get here. It is smaller than I thought it would be, but the dimensions are listed, so I should have checked that first. I love it, I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> this is such a beautiful hair piece. I absolutely love the colors and size and will probably by more in different colors if they&#x27;re available.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to have my niece to wear in our wedding. It came packaged well, the product was true to what the picture represents and I did not see any flaws. Cost was very reasonable. I would recommend this item and have worn it myself.</li>
    <li> Pretty and useful!  I wear my hair up all summer, so I use pretty hair ornaments to give it pizazz from the back and this does exactly that.  It may look dressy, but I wear it with jeans as well as dressier clothes...goes with everything, as long as there is blue in it.  I get lots and lots of compliments.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this and it looks nice in updo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I saw it and said this would look beautiful in my bridesmaid hair! So I bought one for my maid of honor. When I got it I was originally thrown aback because it looked smaller and just not as blingy. But I enlarged the picture online and looked at the comb I received and they were exactly the same. So I can&#x27;t complain. I would have paid more at a store for this comb so I am satisfied with the price and my purchase.</li>
    <li> A very well made hair comb.  Beautiful color with just the right amount of sparkle.  Stays in place with my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and well packaged. Received in perfect condition. This hair clip is simply gorgeous and just sparkles. It is heavier than I expected. So fits good in your hair and very durable. It is simply stunning and will definately order some more hair clips soon. Thanks so&lt;br /&gt;Much!!😄😄</li>
    <li> Cute accent for the hair.  Nice coloring too!</li>
    <li> It is a little bigger than I thought, but it is beautiful! it is sparkly, colorful and it sits in my hair well. The prongs on the clip have small grooves in it so it is able to hold in my hair without slipping out as fast as other clips do.</li>
    <li> Fell apart before I could wear it</li>
    <li> The comb part is a bit long for my 7 year old, but it works well enough.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it is very stunning and beautiful. It is just the right size and the colors are beautiful. I would recommend this product to anyone. Now if I can find a barrette to match, I will be in business.</li>
    <li> The product looks good in pictures but that is where it stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the packet in mail a couple of minutes ago and opened it to put it in my bun. Immediately I hear something drop and I realized that it was one of the &amp;#34;stones&amp;#34; in this clips. Mind you, I have JUST received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like the cheap look and am never going to buy from this seller. EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two phrases: 1. Made in China (SHIPPED from China) 2. You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learnt.</li>
    <li> While the comb itself is very nice, when I received two of these on separate orders, each one was missing stones and they were not even in the packaging. This comb is prone to gems falling out, I guess, and you will probably receive it without some gems as well, so buy expecting this. Unfortunately, it is very noticeable if even a couple of the gems are missing. The only comb I had so much trouble with. But it looks very good in hair and the teeth are longer for larger bun convenience.</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> This is very, very pretty and made well. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to put in my hair so that it&#x27;s not upside down.</li>
    <li> Once it got here it was worth it, it&#x27;s a very pretty piece. It has the vintage look and feel to it to with it&#x27;s comb clip.</li>
    <li> To heavy to stay in your hair</li>
    <li> Very beautiful. I love this! Over well made. Would buy again if I had the chance</li>
    <li> The clip is beautiful in the pictures, but wait until you actually have it in your hands.  I can&#x27;t bear to put it away.  It is a large clip, but it is curved to fit your head.  The clip is soldered to a silver comb, which is beautiful too.  Very long to stay in place with rounded tips so it&#x27;s nice to your scalp.  It came from China, so you will have to wait some time to get it, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  It was well packed...bubble wrap and such.  The peacock is loaded with AB crystals in shaded colors.  It is so sturdy, you won&#x27;t have to worry about loss of crystals or cracking.  I wore it with my hair down.  My hair is about to the middle of my back and wavy.  It stayed in place  didn&#x27;t pull my hair and I felt like a princess.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful piece. I came bubble wrapped. It is heavy but sturdy quality. I already dropped it. I drop EVERYTHING? And it stayed together. It is super blingy. The pic does not do it justice. The pics show 2 different combs. The one I recieved had a silver comb and clear neck with a gradually darker blue body. Not the other way around. Just so you know. Took a long time. I ordered this Nov. 25th and got it Dec. 30th.</li>
    <li> Love it! no to mention the price. I bought a few items together with this one so I&#x27;m just going to copy the same review for all of them because they are all great. The only thing is that the items come from China so it took a while to get here. But it was totally worth the wait. Great quality too.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. Order 2-3 b/c you are going to want a backup &amp; a couple for gifts. Also, since it comes from China you need to order LONG before you actually need it. Mine has a couple of rough edges but it&#x27;s going to be manageable.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift but its so pretty im going to order another one for myself! Its a large comb and the teeth are kinda far apart. Although its lightweight, i dont see this holding up in thin hair.</li>
    <li> It was very pretty. My only complaint is that it took over a month to get to me. It has a bling that everyone should like</li>
    <li> Love this it looks amazing in my hair!</li>
    <li> I think that the &amp;#34;Lovely Vintage Peacock Hair Clip&amp;#34; with blue crystal accents is much nicer than the multi colored clip. I think it is a nice accesory to any outfit.</li>
    <li> Its small which is nice,  most of the ones I&#x27;ve seen on here are larger and almost too big. The crystals are beautiful and I really like this clip.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift and when I got it, late, it was very very pretty.  Love the peacock on it and so colorful.</li>
    <li> Product is absolutly beautiful.  It is heavy and I have trouble keeping it in my hair due to the weight (my hair is thinner and straight).  if you have thick hair i believe it would work great for your hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and she loved it!</li>
    <li> It is very prety and easy to use.  However, I give the rate is 4.7 because it looks perfrect, but when I received it, it has miss one light blue crystal.  If seller gives the extra crystal when it is shipped, that will be fine and convenience for customers.</li>
    <li> I enjoy Lovely hair Jewlz ! This is one of the best for the Price! Looking forward to finding more.</li>
    <li> Never got!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wonder why I was charged but never got this ,unlike the other things I got that Broke!</li>
    <li> Very Stylish and easy to put in as a hair accessory. Doesn&#x27;t pull on hair when removed. Very sturdy and pretty.</li>
    <li> This is a unique and beautiful hair piece. Elegant for evening wear, but small enough for everyday wear! Holds well too!</li>
    <li> So pretty I bought two of them so that I could give one away as a gift. Very sparkly and colors are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, but do not press too hard on the peacock when placing it in your hair.  It might weaken and break.  That said, I still love this hair comb.  Receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when i ordered it that it was a comb...it is still very nice, pretty shades of blue.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece! This hair comb is just lovely! The construction is solid and the beauty of the piece show cannot be seen in the picture provided. The camera doesn&#x27;t do it justice! :-)</li>
    <li> This clip is heavier than I thought and I was very pleased with that. It is very elegant and beautiful to wear any time.</li>
    <li> It came a week early im sooo happy with it and it came in silver instead of gold which I LOVE</li>
    <li> Kinda big for my head and a bit heavy as well but quality and color is nice. Shipping was around the time they had promised.</li>
    <li> Very pretty hair ornament.</li>
    <li> Arrived with jewels fallen off.</li>
    <li> The size is smaller than the picture. Is Ok for girls but no for ladies, but it is pretty and the  quality is OK for the price.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by not only the size but durability of the product...I have thick hair it&#x27;s hard to find something that can hold my hair :-)</li>
    <li> I wore it the same day I received it.  I got a lot of compliments, it was sparkly and stayed in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 60&#x27;s and loved the bling.  Great for any age.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments with comb.  It works well in a bun or side sweep.  It&#x27;s very high quality, made of metal and the stones are brilliant.  This piece is much prettier in person and the price is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Ordered for daughters birthday , crystal peacock clip is beautiful and a great but , but sadly the crystal flower clip which was just as beautiful arrived broken</li>
    <li> I received this hair piece quickly considering where the seller is. It came in one piece and was packaged to prevent harm to it. I love this piece and wore it the first day i got it!! The colors were bright and the piece sparkled...</li>
    <li> Cute but heavy.  French braid with twist or a strong up-do can hold on to this product all day..... if not it will slip out eventually.</li>
    <li> I would consider this to every lady out there and they are beauitful and colorful iam very very happy that i bought everyone of these and i would return for any of these products they are GREAT .............................thanks so much..........:):):):)</li>
    <li> I do not like the fact that the metal bends so easily and expected it to be more like the picture, but on the flip side, it was only a couple of bucks.</li>
    <li> Decently made.  Can break if dropped repeatedly, but generally durable enough for its intended purpose.</li>
    <li> It was as a gift that I bought it. Tho&#x27; it was hard to part with; it was even more beautiful when it arrived.  My niece loved it, and it looks just beautiful in her hair.  What most impressed me was its beauty when it arrived, and how sturdy &amp; well made it was. I return to this site often, looking for another &#x27;find&#x27;.</li>
    <li> A very dainty and pretty item.  I adore it.  Good buy</li>
    <li> Beautiful and very nicely made for the price. Quite a bargain.</li>
    <li> Got as a gift and was very pleased with it. I thought it was going to be made of plastic, but it&#x27;s metal. This means you can bend the comb part to fit snugly in all hair types. Very beautiful and well made.</li>
    <li> THis is a beautiful well made peice. I would recommend it to anyone. The only thing is the shipping takes forever! So dont order it if you need it asap.</li>
    <li> I received this item much faster as expected. This is one beautiful piece; nicely made. It looks expensive as well as amazing in my hair. Please make more designs.</li>
