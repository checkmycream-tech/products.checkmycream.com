      <li>&quot; smell, which I guess is good, but it definately isn&#x27;t my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>It is VERY VERY strong.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell of it</li>
      <li>I have used it even when I am not going tanning because I love the smell and feel of it.  </li>
      <li>I love the color I get with this lotion.</li>
      <li>I rub this on my chiseled abs and sculpted arnold chest while I&#x27;m at vegas in the summer, all i have to say is the ladys love the eye candy.  </li>
      <li>and I love the milky-ness of it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>because it is a good tanning lotion at a good price I would recommend it to any one  the price is double at tanning beds.th</li>
      <li>Not very fond of the smell but works great!</li>
      <li>What it did do is give me a very golden color.  </li>
      <li>I first just want to say how much I LOVE the way this lotion smells.  </li>
      <li>Even after tanning, the milk and honey scent smells good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since used it a few times and am happy with it.</li>
      <li>This one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I think I may move up to something a little more potent soon though.</li>
      <li>Since the smell is so strong, it completely covers the \\&quot;after tan\\</li>
      <li>It came just in time, and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I almost got sunburnt when I first used it.</li>
      <li>and I was noticeably darker after the first use.</li>
      <li>It came in the mail exactly the day that it said it would, and it was packaged really well.</li>
      <li>It really enhanced my tan</li>
      <li>and I plan on buying it again, as it is working very well on me now</li>
      <li>I really like the texture of this tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>It is very natural and pretty.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten darker faster with this product than many other products I have used.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for both indoor and outdoor tanning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple bottles of this so far, and I do really like it.</li>
      <li>The good to great features (not excellent, hence the 4 stars instead of 5) are that it will enhance tan, but not initially (which in my case could be due to the fact that I started out white as snow w/ no tanning history).</li>
      <li>The lotion makes my skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>I had good color results with absolutely no oranginess, and I am pale skinned.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel really soft after tanning.</li>
      <li>It is kind of hard to describe, but it reminds me of the smell of a new baby doll but less powdery.  </li>
      <li>Once that base was achieved, I DID notice that this lotion seemed to accelerate color more and more w/ each use.</li>
      <li>I first ordered this based on other Amazon reviews.  </li>
      <li>As for tanning, I can&#x27;t really say how dark it will get you since I was already pretty dark when I started with it.  </li>
      <li>I have sampled probably ten different lotions trying to find something comparable, and have yet to find anything I like nearly as well.</li>

    <li> This bronzing lotion does its job. I have gotten darker faster with this product than many other products I have used. Like always with tanning be careful how long you tan. I almost got sunburnt when I first used it.</li>
    <li> I first ordered this based on other Amazon reviews.  I use it when I sunbathe at our community pool.  It seems to prevent burning and deepen me tan.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past, &amp; ordered it again based on it&#x27;s great absorption and that the bronzer isn&#x27;t too strong at all. Works great on my face too - No breakouts!</li>
    <li> I first just want to say how much I LOVE the way this lotion smells.  It is kind of hard to describe, but it reminds me of the smell of a new baby doll but less powdery.  The scent is very subtle but lasts a really long time.  The lotion makes my skin very soft.  I have used it even when I am not going tanning because I love the smell and feel of it.  As for tanning, I can&#x27;t really say how dark it will get you since I was already pretty dark when I started with it.  What it did do is give me a very golden color.  It is very natural and pretty.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this lotion, especially at this price!  Also,  I had absolutely no after tan smell.  Just the pleasant lotion smell.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It is thick and creamy, so your skin stays moisturized all day. The smell is phenomenal! Even after tanning, the milk and honey scent smells good enough to eat. Everyone compliments. I had good color results with absolutely no oranginess, and I am pale skinned. I have sampled probably ten different lotions trying to find something comparable, and have yet to find anything I like nearly as well.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture of this tanning lotion. I have only used it a few times, but it is thick, creamy and I can already see my tan getting darker. It makes my skin feel really soft after tanning. However, I despise the smell of this lotion during application. I have never found a designer skin lotion that I didnt like the smell of, until this one... The fragrance is described as \\&quot;milk and honey,\\&quot; but I find it nauseating!!! It is VERY VERY strong. Since the smell is so strong, it completely covers the \\&quot;after tan\\&quot; smell, which I guess is good, but it definately isn&#x27;t my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> I not only used this in the tanning bed but recently took it along with me on my cruise.  It really enhanced my tan and I came back darker than when I had left.  I highly recommend this product for both indoor and outdoor tanning.</li>
    <li> because it is a good tanning lotion at a good price I would recommend it to any one  the price is double at tanning beds.th</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of indoor tanning lotions, even the ones that are over $100. This one is by far my favorite. It smells so nice and I love the milky-ness of it. My sister disagrees that it&#x27;s the best, but I get a great tan with this product and my skin feels moisturized and smells great!</li>
    <li> Not very fond of the smell but works great!</li>
    <li> Best smelling tanning lotion ever. Hands down.</li>
    <li> It came just in time, and was exactly what I wanted. It came in the mail exactly the day that it said it would, and it was packaged really well. I was a little nervous about ordering lotion through the mail because I thought it might leak or explode or something, but it didn&#x27;t. It was perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion/accelerator based off of the reviews on Amazon and at my local tanning salon. I am late 30&#x27;s, Irish, and NEVER tanned (and I mean never went in a bed or in the sun) and decided that I would like to try it. The excellent features of this lotion are smell, non-greasiness, and I didn&#x27;t break out from use. I would leave this on for hours (or overnight) after tanning and I love the smell of it - doesn&#x27;t leave you with a burned skin smell or fake coconut smell (nothing like coconut at all actually). My skin didn&#x27;t break out either. The good to great features (not excellent, hence the 4 stars instead of 5) are that it will enhance tan, but not initially (which in my case could be due to the fact that I started out white as snow w/ no tanning history). It took about 6-8 weeks of tanning 3-4x a week in both a standup and lying bed to get a nice medium-dark base. Once that base was achieved, I DID notice that this lotion seemed to accelerate color more and more w/ each use. I switched over to Black and Tan 75x and now just use this one on my face once a week. I would recommend this lotion and I plan on buying it again, as it is working very well on me now that I have a good base.</li>
    <li> This is the best Designer Skin tanning product I have ever used.  Your skin feels like silk after you use it and I was noticeably darker after the first use.</li>
    <li> Smells great, gives you a great tan and does not turn your skin orange at all!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing better for the price!</li>
    <li> I rub this on my chiseled abs and sculpted arnold chest while I&#x27;m at vegas in the summer, all i have to say is the ladys love the eye candy.  makes me as dark as phil heath, as i bake in the sun with this stuff, and i like to think it makes me feel as sculpted as arnold too. also smells good,so the ladys aren&#x27;t only getting eye candy, but it smells like candy too...</li>
    <li> Perfect! I love the color I get with this lotion. Dark and not orange. The smell is good and I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple bottles of this so far, and I do really like it. I think I may move up to something a little more potent soon though. I do get a really nice color with this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive this package sealed. I&#x27;ve since used it a few times and am happy with it. The smell is nice and I like that I don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed after using it. Great moisturizer, too!</li>
    <li> I love this product. The scent is lovely and the consistency is very nice; not greasy and a bit matte but creamy. The seller delivered just as I hoped and at a price far less than I can find in saloons.</li>
