<ol>
    <li> Thank you! Everything was great!</li>
    <li> Keeps skin clear. Still need to get a facial. May just be me.</li>
    <li> Works great and keeps skin clear.</li>
    <li> I have been using Proactiv&#x27;s Clarifying Night Cream for nearly fifteen years and I have found it to be an outstanding product. My skin looks and feels both healthier and younger now than it did before I began using it on a nightly basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is heavier than the regular day formulas and its rich ingredients soothe and replenish thirsty skin without clogging your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying Night Cream contains natural plant extracts that even skin tone and improve both texture and elasticity. It also contains retinol, which has been proven to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would not want to be without it. I have been quite impressed with it over the years and I know you will be too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Karen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001TLN4AW Proactiv Solution Clarifying Night Cream]]</li>
    <li> I bought it because I was looking for a solution to my black heads because I read on google it would help. It didn&#x27;t really help but it did help with my pimples.</li>
    <li> good product is what I needed met my expectations. thanks for apoyo.espero in future keep buying good as the one I bid produtos</li>
    <li> Great night cream provides moisture and fights pimples</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I already sent a message when I first received my Proactiv.  The bottle had a slit all the way along one side. A lot of it was wasted.</li>
    <li> Nice cream, i use along with the deep cleansing wash.  Soaks right in and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I suffer from adult cystic acne,I was getting shots in my face,etc.tried proactiv will never go without it again!</li>
    <li> This stuff contains retinol and panthenol as well as the salicylic acid. It works like a dream. I&#x27;ve found a product that has all of my favorite ingredients.</li>
    <li> goo product. blackheads were gone, but I am also combining this with several other products, so not really sure if there is anything working better than others. Would rate it four stars if it was not an animal tested product (although I believe that since it is a medicated product, it has to be animal tested though).</li>
    <li> Works great really clears your face after a few washes</li>
    <li> I rotate using this and the proactive repairing cream. Since the other proactive products tend to dry with consistent use, this is a great product to throw in the mix when treating my 34 year old acne prone skin. Makes my skin feel more supple and soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 wks and this product has made my skin break out more.. Every day that i wake up i find a new pimple and my face is dry from the cream that i applied the night before bed..</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent and very effective. We used the scrub and night cream on my husbands back acne. Very hard to beat, but after 3 weeks there is a vast improvement. I think the combination is the key [scrub plus cream]. Somewhat pricey. Absolutely worth the $$. Scrub back well every day with a scrub brush and Proactiv. Apply cream at bed time. This is our routine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Most night creams with vitamin A make me break out, but this has for sure cleared up my skin. It has also started to fade previous acne scars. Even my under eye circles look better!</li>
    <li> This has the right ph level, so it really works on blackheads. I use it in the morning and at night. I hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> its works for my pimples...its dries quickly...i used every night and works for me, and leave your skin clear and clean.</li>
    <li> Was as described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This night cream is fabulous!</li>
