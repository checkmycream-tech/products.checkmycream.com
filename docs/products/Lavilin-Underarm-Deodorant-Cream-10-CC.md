### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They say it is the greatest deodorant out there.</li>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>Best Deodorant in the Market.</li>
      <li>What a best way to test a product, I thought!</li>
      <li>I do have some days that it will dissapoint and it is still not as efffective as clogging your pit pores with a stick of Degree, but I really am impressed with the results the majority of the time.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This product works great.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even believe they still have a market for that kind of stuff!    </li>
      <li>I sweat a lot and am glad that I found this awesome stuff!</li>
      <li>After reading some of the not so good stuff about the chemicals in my antiperspirants</li>
      <li>/&gt;Problem is, I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works as good at this.</li>
      <li>did not work for me, and does not smell good</li>
      <li>Ok it&#x27;s not that great people.</li>
      <li>After looking, I was delighted to find it available through here, because this is the most awesome deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>this is a great product I have no underarm odor the cream goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even believe they still have a market for that kind of stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That being said, it is probably the most effective underarm deodorant not containing alcohol or aluminum that I have tried.</li>
      <li>Hope I can keep getting it for years to come :)</li>
      <li>In the summertime though, it can become an issue when you find yourself in the shower once or more</li>
      <li>/&gt;In order to get the most benefit you must read the insert.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care about claims of odor-free for more than 24 hours; I just wanted one that would work through ONE day.  </li>
      <li>I am more every 3 or 4</li>
      <li>It is better than when I started using it and</li>
      <li>sometimes she&#x27;ll forget to use it altogether, discovering the mistake midday (and I am pleased to say that her un-lavilined pits are categorically ranker than mine).</li>
      <li>the best part&gt;&gt;&gt;The price is almost the same as in 1980.</li>
      <li>Love Lavilin.</li>
      <li>I am fine with reappling after I have showered or bathed, like most people.</li>
      <li>The one thing I will say against them is that they claim you can remain odor free for up to 7 days without reapplying.???</li>
      <li>/&gt;A very reliable product!!!</li>
      <li>As long as I scrubbed my pits good in the shower and had a clean application it seems to work most of the time.</li>
      <li>Maybe it is me, as so many people seem to rate this product so highly.</li>
      <li>You barely need to use any in order for it to be effective - no smathering it on like you must with deoderants and anti-perspirants.</li>
      <li>a more natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I rarely got 24 hr protection from any of them.  </li>
      <li>Based on all the very positive reveiws of this deoderant, I decided to try it out.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant is great and long lasting.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;A year has passed and I am still on my first jar, about halfway through it.</li>
      <li>I have used these for ten years or more.</li>
      <li>have recommended this deodorant  to many of my friend who were having the same problem.  </li>
      <li>I would want to check with their co-workers on that one first.</li>
      <li>It is so good you don&#x27;t need to use it everyday.</li>
      <li>The every day part, not such a big deal if you&#x27;re a lazy-bather such as myself (to put it daintily).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it is gentle on my skin</li>
      <li>you can see, I really put this cream to the test.</li>
      <li>I put in on in the morning and even did an INTENSE workout in the evening</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>also keeps you from using too much.</li>
      <li>price was more than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an aluminum-free deodorant that REALLY worked to keep the odor away.  </li>
      <li>After the initial applications you apply this when you start to &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; and you don&#x27;t clean your pits first; you just apply directly.  </li>
      <li>This is the most natural way I can imagine to cut down on all of the chemicals we use to keep from smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So since I am just looking for a poison free axillary cream that can actually deliver, overall this one comes the closest.</li>
      <li>First application only worked about four days, but each additional application increased the days.  </li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>I decided to try something natural.  </li>
      <li>I have had to stop using this deodorant because I developed a sensitivity to the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I will keep using it a while longer and see if anything changes but it seems like it only works for those who basically sit still all day, not that I am doing anything particularly strenuous.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll still perspire, which is preferable as its a natural, necessary process your body needs, but I can sweat all day and not smell - at all.</li>
      <li>Apparently some reviewers feel like they have had some of those results and only applied once in 10 days?</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also has a mild scent of Grammy&#x27;s night time cold cream that seems to go away once absorbed.  </li>
      <li>This is a cream which is applied by little spatula and hand; I don&#x27;t know what I was really expecting, but it reminded me of that waxy Diaparene product used for diaper rash.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Update: I have had to stop using this deodorant because I developed a sensitivity to the ingredients. *sigh* It took some time to get used to using this deodorant cream, but now I will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is great and long lasting.  Before I used Lavilin deodorant I was having a lot of trouble with deodorants lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this deodorant  to many of my friend who were having the same problem.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for some other folks who swear by it.  They say it is the greatest deodorant out there.</li>
    <li> So yes, it looks and feels like you are rubbing a diaper rash cream into your armpits.&lt;br /&gt;(Ingredients: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil &amp; Hydrogenated Castor Oil &amp; Compernica Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Talc (Pharma), Zinc Oxide, Potato Starch (Modified), Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethyl Citrate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Glycine Soya, Calendula Officianalis Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Tetrasodium EDTA (Tetrasodium Edetate Dihydrate), Fragrance, O-Cymen-5-ol.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a mild scent of Grammy&#x27;s night time cold cream that seems to go away once absorbed.  That being said, it is probably the most effective underarm deodorant not containing alcohol or aluminum that I have tried. It is not as natural as some of the other non-toxic deodorants but is a winner in my book. The one thing I will say against them is that they claim you can remain odor free for up to 7 days without reapplying.??? Ok it&#x27;s not that great people. Apparently some reviewers feel like they have had some of those results and only applied once in 10 days? Hmmm. I would want to check with their co-workers on that one first. Needless to say, I am just looking for 24hr non-toxic odor control here. Just something to get me through my busy, active day and until my next shower. I am fine with reappling after I have showered or bathed, like most people. So since I am just looking for a poison free axillary cream that can actually deliver, overall this one comes the closest.

    <li> I used to buy this from The Vermont Country Store, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore (boo-hoo).  After looking, I was delighted to find it available through here, because this is the most awesome deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  It works for men and women, and it&#x27;s such a treat to not have to apply every day (I can go with once to twice a week)...as well as the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or di- and bi- and all other Big Words Crap in it.  Hope I can keep getting it for years to come :)</li>
    <li> Wow. Maybe it is me, as so many people seem to rate this product so highly. Maybe I haven&#x27;t given it a long enough chance.     I don&#x27;t usually have too much of a perspiration/odor problem but this stuff didn&#x27;t last at all not even all day. I will keep using it a while longer and see if anything changes but it seems like it only works for those who basically sit still all day, not that I am doing anything particularly strenuous.  Time will tell.     This is a cream which is applied by little spatula and hand; I don&#x27;t know what I was really expecting, but it reminded me of that waxy Diaparene product used for diaper rash. Messy to wash off your hands - which I guess is part of why it is supposed to last so long.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  After application, no deodorant is needed for a week even with heavy workouts.  First application only worked about four days, but each additional application increased the days.  It is a little hard to get the white off the first day after application.</li>
    <li> Based on all the very positive reveiws of this deoderant, I decided to try it out.  I used it for over a week, following instructions on how to apply, etc, etc.  and it just did nothing for me.  It was like I wore no deoderant at all.  Very uncomfortable and very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I kickbox three times a week and play soccer on Sunday&#x27;s and yes it works 7 days. I sweat a lot and am glad that I found this awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> Let me open this review by openly admitting a deep wonder at whether or not I&#x27;ll find myself with some terrible cancer or disease in my elder years as a result of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can it work?! No aluminum, but the directions tell you to 1) avoid applying it after you&#x27;ve shaved (don&#x27;t get it into a cut) and 2) avoid applying it every day. The every day part, not such a big deal if you&#x27;re a lazy-bather such as myself (to put it daintily). In the summertime though, it can become an issue when you find yourself in the shower once or more a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And still, this stuff is unbelievable. Chalk it up to hormones, a lousy diet, and terribly inconsistent hygiene (the things my boyfriend puts up with!.. (I kid)) - my pits are RANK! But if I apply a tiny smudge in each armpit after toweling off, I don&#x27;t smell. Period. I&#x27;ll still perspire, which is preferable as its a natural, necessary process your body needs, but I can sweat all day and not smell - at all. Go to bed like a slob without bathing, get up and toil in the fields all the next day - STILL no pit stink! Push it three, four days, I dare you! It&#x27;s really remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend introduced this stuff to me in July 2009. She said the only downside is that it works so well, sometimes she&#x27;ll forget to use it altogether, discovering the mistake midday (and I am pleased to say that her un-lavilined pits are categorically ranker than mine). I&#x27;m inclined to agree - I&#x27;ve found myself blithely forgetting all about ever having had stinky pits until I forget to use the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year has passed and I am still on my first jar, about halfway through it. You barely need to use any in order for it to be effective - no smathering it on like you must with deoderants and anti-perspirants. And it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes! If you&#x27;ve applied enough for it to get on your shirt, you&#x27;ve applied too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out - I heard it doesn&#x27;t work on everybody, but if it works for you, you&#x27;ll never go back to the regular grocery store deoderants. I can&#x27;t even believe they still have a market for that kind of stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Ingredients: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil &amp; Hydrogenated Castor Oil &amp; Copernica Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Talc (Pharma), Zinc Oxide, Potato Starch (Modified), Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethyl Citrate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Glycine Soya, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Tetrasodium EDTA (Tetrasodium Edetate Dihydrate), Fragrance, O-Cymen-5-ol.\\&quot;eoderants. I can&#x27;t even believe they still have a market for that kind of stuff!    \\&quot;Ingredients: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil &amp; Hydrogenated Castor Oil &amp; Copernica Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Talc (Pharma), Zinc Oxide, Potato Starch (Modified), Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethyl Citrate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Glycine Soya, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Tetrasodium EDTA (Tetrasodium Edetate Dihydrate), Fragrance, O-Cymen-5-ol.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> did not work for me, and does not smell good</li>
    <li> price was more than I expected.  I was under the impression that the container was larger than the ones that I had previously purchased.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I wonder why in the heck I quit using this last year, then I remembered, I wanted a more natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works as good at this. Seriously, after 3-4 applications, I could go about 10 days without having to apply it again. I kill even the \\&quot;24 hr\\&quot; or \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; natural stuff half way through my workouts. My P.T. must think I never bathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I am back. I figure 1 day out of 10, and only overnight, as well as drink plenty of water to flush my lymphatic system, it should balance out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus, it works well on feet too, so no need to buy the stuff just for your feet. That saves $.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an aluminum-free deodorant that REALLY worked to keep the odor away.  This one passed the test!  I put in on in the morning and even did an INTENSE workout in the evening and my underarms had no odor at the end of the day.  I don&#x27;t care about claims of odor-free for more than 24 hours; I just wanted one that would work through ONE day.  I&#x27;m now checking into their other products!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. It is better than when I started using it and the best part&gt;&gt;&gt;The price is almost the same as in 1980.</li>
    <li> Love Lavilin. I have used these for ten years or more. Awesome. I only wish it would stop underarm moisture as well as it does odor. I add one every 3-4 days. Great product.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Made me smell worse. Like onions. So odd. After several applications i also noticed some dryness and irritation.</li>
    <li> Product took up to 5 days to adjust to your body. However, it didn&#x27;t seem to last all day and the cream is thick and will show under arms. The consistency is like baby desitin ointment. Just couldn&#x27;t provide all day coverage for me.</li>
    <li> Best Deodorant in the Market. I have been using this for years. It is so good you don&#x27;t need to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This weekend I have gone to a friend&#x27;s wedding. What a best way to test a product, I thought! Applied once before departure, I have taken off on this adventure, and for the last 4 days have led rather debaucherous existence in the \\&quot;City of Brotherly Love\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My itinerary in Philly.&lt;br /&gt;weather: sunny, humid and rainy for the last two days. Temperature: 80-90s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;arrived Friday night, partying till 3 AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday&lt;br /&gt;morning: run 3k to the Museum of Art (Adrian&#x27;s pre-fight run)&lt;br /&gt;day: sightseeing in 90 degree weather&lt;br /&gt;evening: dinner with friends, stayed out till 4 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday&lt;br /&gt;morning: sprinted 2k along the river banks&lt;br /&gt;day: sightseeing in 90 degree weather&lt;br /&gt;evening: wedding and partying till 3 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday&lt;br /&gt;breakfast&lt;br /&gt;sightseeing in 85 degree weather and rain&lt;br /&gt;evening: back home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I really put this cream to the test. Running, walking, drinking, dancing, walking in the rain. I was perspiring as a pig in a slaughter house, and Lavilin kept all the smells at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very reliable product!!! Two thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Btw, I did shower after every sweaty activity, just to wash off the sticky sweat.</li>
    <li> This is the most natural way I can imagine to cut down on all of the chemicals we use to keep from smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to get the most benefit you must read the insert.  After the initial applications you apply this when you start to &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; and you don&#x27;t clean your pits first; you just apply directly.  My friend also uses but she dooesn&#x27;t have to shave.  She goes up to 7 days without reapplying.  I am more every 3 or 4 because I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always perspired and used every product on the market...I am stinky...I rarely got 24 hr protection from any of them.  Finally I could only use Secret.  After reading some of the not so good stuff about the chemicals in my antiperspirants I decided to try something natural.  I have used Lavilin for two years.</li>
    <li> this is a great product I have no underarm odor the cream goes on smoothly and it is gentle on my skin</li>
</ol>
