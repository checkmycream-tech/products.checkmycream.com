      <li>i highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>anyone play to buy alot more in the near future</li>

      <li>Nice enough to be nice but not so expensive that you go broke</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t like any musk to my cologne, but this is nice.  </li>
      <li>Weak scent but good price.</li>
      <li>when i opened the box, it was inside a bubble wrap, then the cologne was in its case, without a clear plastic wrap, that i find off, it feels like its a used cologne of something.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was surprised</li>
      <li>Worth for the money spent!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s good for something a little different from what I usually wear.  </li>

<li> but sadly none of the girls did.</li>
<li> ** stinks like baby powder.</li>

    <li> is not a good product</li>
    <li> The smell of this perfume is ok... of course we all know that playboy&#x27;s perfumes won&#x27;t get you any more sexier than you are. The only thing about the perfume that I don&#x27;t like, is that it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Great scent for the price, and that Playboy logo....always liked it.  lol</li>
    <li> The smell was good the bottle is good size but the smell did not last long for nothing and it just was good for a few mins and then went away so I don&#x27;t like it but they can improve on it</li>
    <li> Worth for the money spent!</li>
    <li> The Malibu in my opinion is one of the best of Playboy&#x27;s line of cologne. All of the Playboy colognes smell really good. I have many different brands of cologne and these are my favorite. Paid three time this much in a fragrance store a few years back. So I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price.</li>
    <li> Whether you are 14 or 40, these colognes smell awesome and they make a great gift. Nice enough to be nice but not so expensive that you go broke</li>
    <li> Weak scent but good price.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my son. My wife even liked the scent as well. My son is now using this every day. may have to get me some.</li>
    <li> Love the scent as do the females who approach me when I wear it. Running low I need to order another bottle of this.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and it came exactly the way they show. Fast and 100% recommendable.</li>
    <li> I literally get complements of how I smell at work every day. All the women love it, however, I am gay. It&#x27;s still a great product and I enjoy that people love the smell of it as much as I do. I&#x27;m excited to try another product by Playboy.</li>
    <li> the name is cool and smells great!</li>
    <li> I usually use Playboy Hollywood, but after reading reviews I tried out the Malibu for a change.....glad I did! Smells really good without being overwhelming. It has a really nice, light fresh scent to it. i highly recommend it! Got some compliments from the ladies after the first time using it. Of course theres better colognes out there , but I wont spend 50-75 dollars anymore on cologne. In this price range Playboy makes a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This , and Hollywood are the only colognes Id recommend from Playboy. &amp;#34;Vegas&amp;#34;, and a few of the others just reek something awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the youngsters out there...this is much better than anything you&#x27;d buy in a spray can NEVER....EVER use body &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; like Axe .Soap, and deodorant is better than using that garbage  Hahaha Get a decent cologne.....</li>
    <li> This Cologne didn&#x27;t come Sealed. I was surprised when i opened the box, it was inside a bubble wrap, then the cologne was in its case, without a clear plastic wrap, that i find off, it feels like its a used cologne of something.&lt;br /&gt;I find this unacceptable. I&#x27;ve purchased over 7 colognes in the past week and they all came sealed, except for this one.&lt;br /&gt;So not sure if what i have is an original or not.</li>
    <li> DELICIOUS!!!.....in my opinion i think this cologne smells very very nice this was a gift for my brother and he also loved it ...and it arrived pretty quick so i will order this cologne again.</li>
    <li> The smell is very nice it wont last a long time but I always keep it in my car just in case I need it, for $10 is well worth the price</li>
    <li> Not worth the money I spent because the smell was not too attractive and you can&#x27;t try the smell when you buy perfume online. I should have asked for the sample if Amazon can send me.</li>
    <li> Went in a bank i got complimented on my scent, went to a funeral i got complimented as well and guess what i really like it. To make this perfect is to have it longer lasting but then again its not a Parfum so it would evaporate quicker. For the price Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and to be honest he never smelt better! This cologne is a must buy if you like a good smellin&#x27; man (:</li>
    <li> This has a great scent, and at the price its hard to beat. Kind of reminds me of Cool Water</li>
    <li> I liked the body spray deo from playboy, but when I got this, you can tell it smells like a cheap cologne. You can tell it&#x27;s for kids. Just go to your department store and check out better quality stuff if you&#x27;re an adult. But it&#x27;s alright for a gift for a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars for somebody ages 14 and under&lt;br /&gt;1 Star for 15+</li>
    <li> its good! so far so good!</li>
    <li> This cologne.smells real good would reccomend it to anyone play to buy alot more in the near future yup its that damn good</li>
    <li> I bought Playboy Malibu for my husband as a Christmas gift.  It has such a nice light scent. He loves it and has actually had other ladies compliment him on the fragrance as well.</li>
    <li> No smell and if there was would only last 10min</li>
    <li> Smells great, great value, and price! Will deg, continue purchasing from this brand.</li>
    <li> This makes me smell like a porn star hahahah jk, but yea the smell is irresistible, and i would recommend it to anyone that is willing to smell good ^_^</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, I enjoyed wearing it.  Has a clean, fresh breeze scent.  The only con of this product is that the smell does not last long.</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and clean no musky funky smell only downside is it wears off after 4-6 hours depending on how much you spray smells really nice to be this cheap though</li>
    <li> ask any women they no if its good or just nasty but I realy liked this product awesome awesome awesome</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like any musk to my cologne, but this is nice.  I think it&#x27;s good for something a little different from what I usually wear.  Plus, I think being made by Playboy sounds good.  And, the best part, the price was cheap.  Always a big deal. I would buy it again at the same price.  Probably not if the price went up.</li>
    <li> s*** stinks like baby powder. did not like it at all i thought it was perfume at first. not buying again</li>
    <li> If you want to step your cologne game up, this is the cologne you need in your life. Trust me. Did you see the price? The cologne is valuable and I like it</li>
    <li> The person I bought it for is a cologne crazed person and he loveds this. It made a great asset to his collection he said.</li>
    <li> this fragance is very good only that the arom disapear with some hours, but is very good i like it is nice and the people smell it, thanks a lot  i buy again</li>
    <li> I used this for my brother&#x27;s graduation expecting the girls to be all up on my... but sadly none of the girls did. However, they did compliment me on my smell. they said that it smells great. ;)</li>
