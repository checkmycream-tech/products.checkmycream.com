      <li>I have been using this for many years, I have tried other products nothing compares.</li>

      <li>(alternating with other dead sea premier ones...problematic skin and biox mask)&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great addition.  </li>
      <li>However, it is worth the &amp;#34;suffering.&amp;#34; The mask leaves my normal to dry skin &amp;#34;fed.&amp;#34; It looks plumper and healthier.</li>
      <li>I do like this mask, but giving it 4 stars simply because it is kind of hard to have on for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have never had a problem with this product.  </li>
      <li>So far with the 2 times I saw no change in my skin.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I use this mask every a few times a week. (alternating with other dead sea premier ones...problematic skin and biox mask)&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great addition.  it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and tightened.  I follow by using the serum and then the cream.  I love how you can actually feel sensation in your skin - you can feel the mask working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;apply a thick coat and massage on.  then massage every five minutes.  keep on for about 25mins.  I have been using strictly dead sea premier products for 6 years.  I have sensitive skin and have never had a problem with this product.  I use the face wash, face scrub, problematic mask (i have a few stubborn blackheads every now and again, but nothing else) biox set and eye serum and eye cream.  other products I have just added are collagen mask and liposome serum.  both excellent additions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only dislikes I have is that I notice if I don&#x27;t use premier face wash, product does not feel as effective.  So heads up to you that I recommend buying the face wash to get the full affect.  It&#x27;s definitely worth it!  You can get the face wash on here for about $10.</li>
    <li> This mask is fantastic -it is good to use with stretch and revitalizing mask.  I use it first and then the stretch mask.  This one in addition to the other seems to be revitaliing my face!!</li>
    <li> It feel like a creamy cleanser that benefits your winkles in your skin.  I have noticed a more even color tone with less redness on my face.  I enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again when there is a 2 for 1 sale.</li>
    <li> I just received the product a few days ago and have used it 2 times. So far with the 2 times I saw no change in my skin. I didn&#x27;t expect  to see much however it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. My other comment is the heavy jar it comes in is cumbersome and the lid doesn&#x27;t fit tightly</li>
    <li> this product lasts a long time.  use the spatula. I have been using this for many years, I have tried other products nothing compares.</li>
    <li> This line is one of the best I have ever tried an bealve me I tried allot of products from cheap to very pricey..my skin feels and looks great..</li>
    <li> I do like this mask, but giving it 4 stars simply because it is kind of hard to have on for 15 minutes. The mask starts to &amp;#34;melt,&amp;#34; and the grease starts to go into your mouth and your eyes... even if I apply it far away from those areas. However, it is worth the &amp;#34;suffering.&amp;#34; The mask leaves my normal to dry skin &amp;#34;fed.&amp;#34; It looks plumper and healthier. I use this mask 1-2 times a week before bed.</li>
    <li> Definitely will be reordering this to keep in my skin care arsenal. Great for my 58 year-old skin.  Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I love the Dead Sea Products and unfortunately was introduced to them by one of the overbearing sales women at a kiosk in the mall.  I think you all know what I am talking about.  They are the women that can sell ice to someone who lives on a glacier.  Well, I was weak, weak, weak and ended up buying a few products at a cost that I still cannot believe I paid.&lt;br /&gt;I used the products, but knew I was never going to spend that kind of money again on these products no matter how good they were.&lt;br /&gt;Then I found everything I used and more on Amazon.  What a lifesaver.  I have not found one of their products that I don&#x27;t like and the dealers at Amazon make it possible to use them and try new ones.&lt;br /&gt;All of the Dead Sea masks I have tried are very good.  I have tried several different ones for different reasons, and I have been impressed with all of them.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask.  Makes your face feel great.&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered to my door and it was in good condition.</li>
    <li> The delivery of this product was fast. I star to use and it is that I expected</li>
    <li> Ok, doesn&#x27;t do much for me. Maybe just not made for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this mask. Have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Love this product as well as all the Premier products. Great price and leaves skin feeling smooth, soft and silky. The best skin care products I have found. You won&#x27;t be sorry with any of the Premier products.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen an iota of improvement even after weeks of use.  I think I&#x27;d rather EAT the carrots and seaweed.  I&#x27;d likely get better results.  Another Premier product with more hype than hope.</li>
    <li> it really works , helps to improve the skin  more than any cream, giving visible long-lasting results. Deep wrinkles if you have any will diminish, not totally disappear of course - let&#x27;s be realistic; but so far it seems the best- working product i have tried</li>
    <li> i tried this in my my local cosmetic store which cost 4 times as the price here. so im gonna come back for sure! just wondering why is there such a big price difference.</li>
    <li> I bought and used the product. I have sensitive skin and i can not use too many products on my face. This product however dose not make me break out and i like the way it makes my skin feel and look. Dosent get rid of wrinkles but it softens them and seems to brighten my skin. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this as a mask and really like it. It feels so rich and creamy and always get compliment on my skin for a few days after having used it.</li>
