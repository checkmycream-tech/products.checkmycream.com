    <li> Quick and fast shipping as promised. This smells exactly like the previous one I had. I would absolutely recommend this to other people. Just not my immediate group of friends because I don&#x27;t want any of them smelling like me.</li>
    <li> Product smells watered down not as strong smelling as it has been when i bought from Victoria Secrets</li>

    <li> This is the only cologne I let my husband wear. I love, love, love it. I hate the price, but the bottle tends to last him about a year so I guess I really can not complain. It smells amazing and lasts all day long.</li>
