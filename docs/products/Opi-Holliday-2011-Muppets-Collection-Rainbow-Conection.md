      <li>Please make your own decisions but be advised so you don&#x27;t suffer from sticker shock like I did.</li>
      <li>Great for special occasions.</li>

      <li>but aside from that im pretty happy with the product</li>
      <li>thank u:)</li>
      <li>I love wearing this fingernail polish but it does require two to three coats to get the desired effect.</li>
      <li>This is by farrrrrrrr my favorite nail polish I love this stuff and</li>
      <li>My favorite was over a frosted silver polish.</li>
      <li>The sparkle is superb, but it takes multiple coats to get to the level of sparkle that&#x27;s pictured.</li>
      <li>I have to say I did expect better from OPI.  </li>
      <li>I have found if you soak one cottonball for each nail in acetone and put it on top of the nail and wait about 1 minute then</li>
      <li>I sure hope my daughter likes it :)</li>
      <li>Anyway, I love this polish and get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
      <li>So glad to find this product.</li>

      <li>I get so many compliments on this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>all the glitter is in many colors (Silver based, no gold-</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite polishes ever.</li>
      <li>However, as much as I love it, this isn&#x27;t something that I&#x27;ll be buying again.   </li>
      <li>but I do have to say it is my favorite nail polish.</li>
      <li>Could be used alone or on top of nail polish.</li>
      <li>Aside from it arriving much later than anticipated, it looks like a great color!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and</li>
      <li>Very fun and easy to apply, 2 coats was fine for me..</li>
      <li>I like to wear a light colored nail polish and then apply 1 coat of this nail polish</li>
      <li>Lightly sparkled, or lots of coats to give it a heavier look.  </li>
      <li>Service is great and fast, came very protected so bottle wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty easy!</li>
      <li>but I think that it is worth the price it is shown for!</li>
      <li>(takes about 3 coats to be totally opaque though; nice for layering too!)</li>
      <li>Got it to add some festive cheer to my nails this holiday &amp; it has not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Really nice glitters, love the different size of them.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this and truly the rainbow sparkle is beautiful but the coverage and durability of this was less than hoped for.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty, layers well and is really eye catching.</li>
      <li>This polish is really cool and noticeable.  </li>
      <li>You have to put a ton of coats on to look like picture but its not even that cool.</li>
      <li>Even over other polish it looks great.  </li>
      <li>the color is very very pretty</li>
      <li>This is a very fun and pretty color.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but this color would look great over another color (i.e. black).</li>
      <li>Rainbow Connection is alot of fun, but it&#x27;s also a bit of a pain.  </li>
      <li>This is so fun to wear.</li>
      <li>the price is right..</li>
      <li>It does take several coats to get the right look, but I guess that&#x27;s true for most glitter polishes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty and a lot of fun to put on.   </li>
      <li>Perhaps this is a great deal and the glitter is real gold and silver flake, but still seems a little pricey to me.</li>
      <li>Definitely stands out and goes great with n e thing, dark or light color clothing.</li>
      <li>it looks pretty cool,but i dont know,  </li>
      <li>On the way to work, three more nails lost their polish, in the same way.</li>
      <li>exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m mostly reviewing the color, and that is personal opinion.  </li>
      <li>It is really pretty</li>
      <li>love the different sparkles of the Opi Holiday 2011 Muppets collection.   </li>
      <li>Other than it&#x27;s a nice color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to using this for my New Year&#x27;s color and it looks fantastically fun.</li>
      <li>Certainly a must have</li>
      <li>Great on its own (need a few coats) or over a dark color - I currently have it over my OPI Roadhouse Blues.</li>
      <li>This OPI line is actually very pretty, needs a few coats to look even better.</li>
      <li>It is a real pain to take off.</li>
      <li>I would however recommend this to friends because it is very \\&quot;fun\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>start working it off, it is much easier.</li>
      <li>It is very forgiving if you bang it up or chip it.</li>
      <li>Item was packed very well and arrived timely.</li>
      <li>but I find it easy as long as your more so poke the wand over your nail and let the polish spread and then applying one other coat.</li>
      <li>It looks really good over black, red and silver nail polish.</li>
      <li>This nail polish is hands down one of my favorite nail polishes of all time.  </li>
      <li>This is such a fun color of holidays and for any sort of girls night like a bachelorette party or a weekend getaway.  </li>
      <li>at a normal salon store you can get this for around 6:50.</li>
      <li>Takes several coats to get the complete look, but it is well worth the effort.</li>
      <li>It goes on and looks basically exactly like the featured photo--in my case, after only two coats.</li>
      <li>You can really change the look of it using different bases and changing the number of layers you put on.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for my daughter and was I suprised when only one bottle (normal nail polish sized bottle) arrived and the total including shipping was just under $30.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this OPI polish a week or so before Thanksgiving. I was given a timeline of when it would arrive, which was about a week later. I knew it was the holiday season so I gave it some leeway. But, two weeks late? Unfortunate.   I&#x27;m looking forward to using this for my New Year&#x27;s color and it looks fantastically fun. Aside from it arriving much later than anticipated, it looks like a great color!</li>
    <li> Our 14-year-old granddaughter shrieked when she opened this up. \\&quot;OH, GRANDMA...I LOOVVVE THIS!!!!!\\&quot; I took a chance and guess I made a hit with her. I would never buy this for me, but I&#x27;m not 14. :) She&#x27;s probably already wearing it and showing off to her friends. Great gift for a teen-ager.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is hands down one of my favorite nail polishes of all time.  I like to wear a light colored nail polish and then apply 1 coat of this nail polish and it looks awesome because you can see the color underneath yet still have pieces of glitter on your nails that add \\&quot;fun\\&quot;.  I was given this polish as a gift so I do not know what price it was bought for but I think that it is worth the price it is shown for!</li>

    <li> Pros: It&#x27;s really pretty, layers well and is really eye catching. Great for special occasions. You can really change the look of it using different bases and changing the number of layers you put on.  Cons: It&#x27;s reallly hard to remove, Need pure acetone to do it well. It chips very easy.</li>
    <li> The product was great!  This is such a fun color of holidays and for any sort of girls night like a bachelorette party or a weekend getaway.  This is one of my favorite polishes ever.</li>
    <li> I love wearing this fingernail polish but it does require two to three coats to get the desired effect. The only downfall is that by doing that it chips a lot easier. I have found if i do touch ups it&#x27;s pretty easy!</li>
    <li> The sparkle is superb, but it takes multiple coats to get to the level of sparkle that&#x27;s pictured. Not a &amp;#34;swipe and go&amp;#34; polish, so be prepared to take your time layering.</li>
    <li> This is a very fun and pretty color. It does take several coats to get the right look, but I guess that&#x27;s true for most glitter polishes. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but this color would look great over another color (i.e. black).</li>
    <li> this is sooooo overpriced. at a normal salon store you can get this for around 6:50. Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a ripoff. Especially if you&#x27;re in beauty school. The nail polish is awesome, buy it from a wholesale seller at a beauty supply that carries OPI, or a jcpenny.</li>
    <li> I ordered this about a month ago and have used it several times since. It looks really good over black, red and silver nail polish. It looks pretty good on its own but does require about 3 coats for good glitter coverage on its own. It is very forgiving if you bang it up or chip it. My favorite was over a frosted silver polish. It made my nails look like Christmas ornaments. I used a fast dry topcoat over the  layers of polish -- 2 coats of a fast dry nail polish as a base and 2 coats of the Rainbow Connection -- this makes the background color show through, but the emphasis is on the glitter. I have used it without the topcoat and noticed that the bigger color flakes tend to come off when you wash your hands. Without the topcoat it only lasted 2 days. With a topcoat it lasted about 6 days. It is a real pain to take off. I have found if you soak one cottonball for each nail in acetone and put it on top of the nail and wait about 1 minute then start working it off, it is much easier. The trick is to let the soaked cottonball sit on the nail for about a minute to soften all that stuff. Anyway, I love this polish and get a lot of compliments on it. I even took it to work so the manager could do her nails before a party!! She ended up buying some on Amazon, too.</li>
    <li> So glad to find this product. It is really pretty and if you put on several coats it is brighter. My daughter asked specifically for this polish and we couldn&#x27;t find it in our town. So glad to find it online.</li>
    <li> It is more amazing than it looks in the picture! Glitter and shine everywhere :) (takes about 3 coats to be totally opaque though; nice for layering too!)</li>
    <li> Love the color and look.  You can wear it many ways.  Lightly sparkled, or lots of coats to give it a heavier look.  Even over other polish it looks great.  This is so fun to wear.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really nice glitters, love the different size of them. Quite hard to get rid of them. Could be used alone or on top of nail polish.</li>
    <li> The color on this is great. It goes on and looks basically exactly like the featured photo--in my case, after only two coats. It&#x27;s really pretty and a lot of fun to put on.   However, as much as I love it, this isn&#x27;t something that I&#x27;ll be buying again.   I don&#x27;t know if there was something wrong with the batch I received, or whether it was something I did, but I&#x27;ve never had nail polish that was this fragile. I used this on my fingernails. I did what I usually do: clear base coat, let it dry completely, apply however many coats of the color I&#x27;m using, let it dry completely between coats, finish with a clear topcoat. I used OPI brand base and topcoats. After letting my nails dry completely, I went to bed. I did literally nothing else between putting the nail polish on and climbing into bed.   When I woke up the next morning, the polish had popped off--as in, the entire coat came away in one piece--from two of my nails. I chalked it up to bad luck (maybe I&#x27;d done something wrong), and I redid those nails before going into work.   On the way to work, three more nails lost their polish, in the same way. By the end of the day, it looked as though I hadn&#x27;t painted my nails. Attempting to redo my nails (again, after stripping off the remaining polish with a non-acetone remover, washing my hands, thoroughly drying them, and reapplying a base coat/finishing with a top coat) had the same result: no polish was left on my fingers after 24 hours. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something about the size of the glitter or what, but something about this color makes it not want to stay on. I suppose if I figure out a way to keep it on,  I&#x27;ll update this review, but at the moment, I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll get my glitter fix from a different color--or brand.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this nail polish.  Takes several coats to get the complete look, but it is well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Yes, this may be overpriced, but I live in a small town and there aren&#x27;t stores around that sell OPI here. Very fun and easy to apply, 2 coats was fine for me.. Love it!</li>
    <li> This OPI line is actually very pretty, needs a few coats to look even better. Service is great and fast, came very protected so bottle wouldn&#x27;t break. I would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> love the different sparkles of the Opi Holiday 2011 Muppets collection.   The color, Rainbow Connection, speaks for itself.  Certainly a must have</li>
    <li> I only use OPI nail polish.  This polish is really cool and noticeable.  The only con - it&#x27;s extremely difficult to get off with remover.  I would however recommend this to friends because it is very \\&quot;fun\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Wonderful price and colors..  Easy to use and the price is right.. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. !!!! Awesome</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this and truly the rainbow sparkle is beautiful but the coverage and durability of this was less than hoped for.  I have to say I did expect better from OPI.  But the polish took 2-3 coats to fully cover the nail and then it chipped, flaked or came off altogher within hours.  Even with a base and finish coat there has been nothing that I&#x27;ve found that will keep this on for more than a day.</li>
    <li> I like this polish but again you have to do at least 3 or 4 coats before polish will stick. Other than it&#x27;s a nice color also OPI by nicole has the SAME color for cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love OPI, and have no complaints about the product.  I&#x27;m mostly reviewing the color, and that is personal opinion.  Rainbow Connection is alot of fun, but it&#x27;s also a bit of a pain.  Taking it off requires patience and time and lots of remover.  I like it on its own, but will probably eventually layer it on something, just to see.  It has small glitter, and at least three different sizes of hexagonal glitter pieces in it.  all the glitter is in many colors (Silver based, no gold- though there is yellow).</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and was I suprised when only one bottle (normal nail polish sized bottle) arrived and the total including shipping was just under $30. Item was packed very well and arrived timely. Perhaps this is a great deal and the glitter is real gold and silver flake, but still seems a little pricey to me. Please make your own decisions but be advised so you don&#x27;t suffer from sticker shock like I did. I sure hope my daughter likes it :)</li>
    <li> Will need to apply 2/3 coats for noticable effect</li>
    <li> Love this polish! Reminds me of being a kid and watching the Muppets with my Father! Love the warm happy feeling I get when wearing this!</li>
    <li> Set aside a lot of time to use this polish. You&#x27;ll want to place some of the glitter and it takes a long time to dry. Very nice!</li>
    <li> I feel this was way over priced. You have to put a ton of coats on to look like picture but its not even that cool. Then it doesn&#x27;t come off. I mean you have to scrub hard for hours to remove the glitter chunks and the colors are not pretty together.</li>
    <li> It is good product and looks great. It would make a awesome gift for someone and yourself. It is awesome.</li>
    <li> I splurged when I bought this but I do have to say it is my favorite nail polish. Some may argue it is hard to put on but I find it easy as long as your more so poke the wand over your nail and let the polish spread and then applying one other coat. I usually put a clear coat on and it will last me a month if not more. Very beautiful and shiny. Looks like disco toes!</li>
    <li> This is by farrrrrrrr my favorite nail polish I love this stuff and the color is very very pretty I get a lot of compliments on this and people asking where I got it</li>
    <li> yeah it looks pretty cool,but i dont know,  i bought it for my girlfriend.Hope she&#x27;ll like it anyway  thank u:)</li>
    <li> one of the best glitter nail polish i have ever used. Definitely stands out and goes great with n e thing, dark or light color clothing. You can dress it up or down!</li>
    <li> i must say i LOVE the way this polish comes out after you put two coats on! it looks like it was done in a salon! exactly like the picture. the only reason i didnt give it four stars is because the price.  but aside from that im pretty happy with the product</li>
    <li> There is no better nail polish than OPI; it&#x27;s all I wear now and this polish gets lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> She did i have no idea why nail polishes mean so much for women, filling up space for amazon review.</li>
    <li> As with all glitter nail polishes, extremely difficult to get nails like the product photo. Glitter comes out sparsely and is ridiculously hard to remove, even with acetone nail remover.</li>
