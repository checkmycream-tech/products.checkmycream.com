      <li>/&gt;This is for the color Rose d&#x27;Oro.</li>
      <li>:) Milani is a great make up brand very profesional and lots of great and glamours shades to choose from.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s called Rose D/Oro, but it&#x27;s more of a coral color than a rose.</li>
      <li>The Rose D&#x27;Oro blush looked much more &amp;#34;rosy&amp;#34; in the picture.  </li>
      <li>I love the Milani Rose D&#x27;oro blush.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE Milani products &amp; this color is one of the best for a natural flush with a touch of sparkle!!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>Great color, goes on easily, does fade quickly</li>

      <li>I love the color of this blush.</li>
      <li>I love this blush...</li>
      <li>packaging is kind of dicey and cheap.</li>
      <li>However, so many people recommended this to me (including YouTubers), that I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
      <li>love Nars blush, at $28 a pan</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve no idea how Milani has pulled off this bit of makeup magic...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely color, just jarringly orange against my pinker skin tones.  </li>
      <li>my favorite color for sure</li>
      <li>I am placing this review under every Milani blush I have tried, as it doesn&#x27;t seem as though these products are getting the love they deserve.</li>
      <li>so I will try to find it another home with a friend more able to enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>They have amazing long wear and great color</li>
      <li>I like this blush and how easily and fully it goes on my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>i recommend this for sure to all the pretty people outthere who put make-up on!&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It is a perfect color for my very dark brunette hair, eyes/lashes.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m somewhat tan with yellow undertones), and I can say without a doubt that it is great.</li>
      <li>Very economical, too.</li>
      <li>It looks &amp; feels high-class &amp; sophisticated, without the higher price tag.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got it on a whim because the color looked nice and I appreciated the golden undertones in the picture</li>
      <li>I am very pale, and this color was perfect for me.</li>
      <li>first time to the Milani line and this blush to super cute on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>but it is true.  </li>
      <li>I love this Blush, the color is so intense..</li>
      <li>It has a beautiful sheen to it though and adds a little bit of highlight to the face as well.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.  </li>
      <li>the color is absolutely gorg and this blush is easy to apply without any hassle because it shows on the cheeks and stays on for hours.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it looks so natural yet shimmers.</li>
      <li>the blush is such a beutifull shade, as other reviews say and It brings out the best in your complextion.</li>
      <li>They were right</li>
      <li>I love how the golden shimmer stands out with the pink (not in a tacky or cheap way)</li>
      <li>Have to have a good brush or it could go on to dark in some spots.</li>
      <li>I especially like the gold shimmer, which makes it a great alternative to a traditional bronzer!</li>
      <li>The package got to me very fast and the product was well wrapped.</li>
      <li>This is the first blush I ever bought for myself.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use make up that much, so I wasn&#x27;t jumping to buy myself blush.</li>
      <li>that is a crack habit I can&#x27;t support very often.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
      <li>Their prices are also very reasonable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Goes on very even and blends well.  </li>
      <li>I use the Real Techniques brushes and my Smashbox contour brush, depending on how much color and where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is soooo disappointing that many stores stopped stocking Milani as their colors are truly vibrant &amp; one of a kind.</li>
      <li>(You might want to use a different brush though; I often have to blend it out more with my fingers or with an actual blush brush.)</li>
      <li>I dare you to compare this blush to any high end blush product....</li>
      <li>I wish it was a little more pigmented though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a hard pressed powder and comes with its own comb-style brush and a compact mirror.</li>
      <li>Love there products long lasting 👌</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the mirror since it gets clouded with powder much too easily, but the brush is just abrasive enough to scrape and hold powder off the product and just soft enough to not scratch your face when you apply it.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>wow!...</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>It is a gold-veined rose pink with a slight peach twinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am 60 years old.</li>
      <li>Just gives it a soft glow without being too bronzy-gold in the sunlight.</li>
      <li>The application itself is anywhere from sheer to opaque depending on how much you have on your brush, but you have a lot of control either way.</li>
      <li>Low $$, high quality, and virtually ANY color will work with your coloring.</li>
      <li>I just use a light brush of this over my usual blush.</li>
      <li>It also gets really powdery if you aren&#x27;t careful, so don&#x27;t upturn it and whatever you do, don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice glow without being too exaggerated.</li>
      <li>it has little flecks of gold in amongst the rose...but is not too much on your face.</li>

    <li> This is really a lovely color and probably would look wonderful on any skin tone.  I especially like the gold shimmer, which makes it a great alternative to a traditional bronzer!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! the color is absolutely gorg and this blush is easy to apply without any hassle because it shows on the cheeks and stays on for hours.The package got to me very fast and the product was well wrapped.</li>
    <li> I Like this blush,,,,also the eye liner,,,,,</li>
    <li> Great color, goes on easily, does fade quickly</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife. She loves it!</li>
    <li> The Rose D&#x27;Oro blush looked much more &amp;#34;rosy&amp;#34; in the picture.  In reality, it is closer to a rust color - at least the one I received.  It does not work at all with my skin tones.  It&#x27;s a lovely color, just jarringly orange against my pinker skin tones.  I tried it once since some blush looks much different on than in the container.  Nope, didn&#x27;t work for me.  But, I will say that the color lasted all day in combination with the foundation and powder I use.  The quality is nice so I will try to find it another home with a friend more able to enjoy it.  There is nothing wrong with it at all; it just isn&#x27;t the right color for me.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this blush. I wish it was a little more pigmented though. It takes a couple layers for it to show up on my skin even though I&#x27;m a fair complexion. It has a beautiful sheen to it though and adds a little bit of highlight to the face as well.</li>

    <li> I like this blush and how easily and fully it goes on my cheeks.  However, the color description is misleading.  It&#x27;s called Rose D/Oro, but it&#x27;s more of a coral color than a rose.</li>
    <li> Very pretty.  Have to have a good brush or it could go on to dark in some spots.</li>

    <li> I purchased this one and the Luminoso blushes and I must say Rose D&#x27;Oro is my all time favorite! I love how the golden shimmer stands out with the pink (not in a tacky or cheap way) it looks gorgeous!</li>

    <li> I love this light and beautiful blush, It goes on flawlessly and last a long time, not to mention you look beautiful.</li>
    <li> Goes on very even and blends well.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the sparkles in this. To each their own but I won&#x27;t be using this one. Maybe other colors have shimmer instead of sparkles?</li>
    <li> Color just does not stay longer than an hour.</li>
    <li> blendable, beautifully pigmented and shimmery application. my favorite color for sure</li>
    <li> wow!... wow! wow! wow! This blush is very beautiful, you can get lost in the depth of its color... it goes on very nicely, shimmers and sparkles.... it&#x27;s truly a very beautiful color. i recommend this for sure to all the pretty people outthere who put make-up on!&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love this blush...it has little flecks of gold in amongst the rose...but is not too much on your face. Just gives it a soft glow without being too bronzy-gold in the sunlight. I won&#x27;t user any blush but this...I am 60 years old.</li>
    <li> I am placing this review under every Milani blush I have tried, as it doesn&#x27;t seem as though these products are getting the love they deserve. Or at least no one on Amazon is saying so! With the Milani blush, don&#x27;t look at a color and say, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wear that because of my coloring\\&quot;. YES YOU CAN. These blushes are amazing. EVERY SINGLE COLOR has worked with my coloring, whether it is pink, peach, purple, red...anyone can wear these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for the color Rose d&#x27;Oro. I am very pale, and this color was perfect for me. It is a gold-veined rose pink with a slight peach twinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Nars blush, at $28 a pan that is a crack habit I can&#x27;t support very often. I picked up these Milani blushes in every color. I dare you to compare this blush to any high end blush product....ANY. They have amazing long wear and great color payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The brush included with it is worthless. Unless you *LIKE* your blush to look like stripes of war paint! I use the Real Techniques brushes and my Smashbox contour brush, depending on how much color and where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The packaging is kind of dicey and cheap. That is no indication however, of the quality of the product inside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t drop it, whatever you do! It will shatter even from a short fall. But you can collect the broken contents, mix with enough 99% alcohol to make a paste, and re-press this into another container if you need to. Note though that the color will become one solid color mix and not the delicately veined color that it was before it smashed to bits. However it will still look the same on your face.</li>
    <li> I love this Blush, the color is so intense.. a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have loved the Milani blushes for years but my stupid local Walgreens has decided to cease carrying the brand.&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer has already said - these are a great find!  Low $$, high quality, and virtually ANY color will work with your coloring. I&#x27;ve no idea how Milani has pulled off this bit of makeup magic...but it is true.  Pick a color that sounds good to you.  I use them all!</li>
    <li> This is the first blush I ever bought for myself. I got it on a whim because the color looked nice and I appreciated the golden undertones in the picture (I&#x27;m somewhat tan with yellow undertones), and I can say without a doubt that it is great. It&#x27;s a hard pressed powder and comes with its own comb-style brush and a compact mirror. I don&#x27;t use the mirror since it gets clouded with powder much too easily, but the brush is just abrasive enough to scrape and hold powder off the product and just soft enough to not scratch your face when you apply it. (You might want to use a different brush though; I often have to blend it out more with my fingers or with an actual blush brush.) The application itself is anywhere from sheer to opaque depending on how much you have on your brush, but you have a lot of control either way. The only downside to this is that it doesn&#x27;t really last very long by itself without a primer or a finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that it /is/ sparkly, so keep that in mind. It also gets really powdery if you aren&#x27;t careful, so don&#x27;t upturn it and whatever you do, don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Milani products &amp; this color is one of the best for a natural flush with a touch of sparkle!!&lt;br /&gt;It is soooo disappointing that many stores stopped stocking Milani as their colors are truly vibrant &amp; one of a kind. Their prices are also very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;If you love make-up &amp; feeling like you&#x27;re getting the best for your money, I would buy Milani. It looks &amp; feels high-class &amp; sophisticated, without the higher price tag.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for continuing to stock these great products! A definite 5-star buy!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color!  Love It!!</li>
    <li> first time to the Milani line and this blush to super cute on my cheeks. I just use a bit, as I do not like the blushing so hard you can hardly stand it look.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color for all shades, buildable.</li>
    <li> I love the Milani Rose D&#x27;oro blush. It is a perfect color for my very dark brunette hair, eyes/lashes. Just a little goes a long way. I use a blush brush (not too big) and swirl it from my cheeks outward and up. It looks like I have been sun-kissed. Love it!! Very economical, too. Suggestion: A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Milani products are great the blush is such a beutifull shade, as other reviews say and It brings out the best in your complextion. :) Milani is a great make up brand very profesional and lots of great and glamours shades to choose from.I wish i could get them all~</li>
    <li> blush of high quality, well smells and perfectly keeps on skin, packing wonderful, I will buy still the same blush of this company. Thanks Amazon</li>
