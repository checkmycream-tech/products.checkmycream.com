      <li>My hair only needs this curly encouragement &amp; this product is REALLY great.</li>
      <li>it cheaper cost is important</li>
      <li>My husband got this free for me from the salon with some deal.  </li>

      <li>Mixing this with a cheaper drugstore brand spray leads to a reasonable value overall to take great care of my curls!</li>
      <li>It gives good curl definition and control, it&#x27;s not sticky and it keeps my hair soft and not crunchy.</li>
      <li>Light clean smell,</li>
      <li>I have super fine, bendy hair.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite product for enhancing curls.</li>
      <li>and this doesn&#x27;t do much to add moisture where it is needed most.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, I developed a new routine and my hair looked great as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes my curls super frizzy.</li>
      <li>Ever since dating an Aveda stylist I&#x27;ve been a loyal supporter of the brand.  </li>
      <li>This is a great leave in conditioner that gives my curls definition without being greasy and weighing them down.</li>
      <li>/wavy without form most of the time, and pretty curly/wavy when it wants to be (1 or 2 times a month...).</li>
      <li>and I was good to go (after waiting two hours for my hair to dry).  </li>
      <li>If you want my feed back don&#x27;t tell me how many words I have to write!</li>
      <li>First of all, I have WAVY hair, not curly ringlets like I wish I had!</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair (mix of 2c/3a) that responds really well to this cream.</li>
      <li>I really like how lightweight this product is and that it has a light scent.</li>
      <li>That it actually enhances curls is amazing, that it does it without leaving any residue</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the inconvenience of having to enter shipping and payment information to save almost 30%.  </li>
      <li>It seems to marshal hair into curls, instead of each individual hair taking its own</li>
      <li>As I am the guy who purchases them as gifts I too become worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>My wife of course thinks they are worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like that product either until I was shown how to use it right.</li>
      <li>I have curly, frizzy, thin hair and this product does wonders to smooth out the frizziness and give an appearance of a fuller head of hair that feels great.  </li>
      <li>Great for wavy and curly hair not sticky or hard...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love agenda products and this one especially.  It makes really lovely defined curls out of my frizzy curls, but there is absolutely no crunch to them like others products.  They stay really soft and natural looking, but still really defined.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than dozens of others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Wow! Best curl enhancer on the market. Lots of products promise results, Be Curly delivers. That it actually enhances curls is amazing, that it does it without leaving any residue is magical. You have to have naturally wavy or curly hair for this to work though. It will not curl straight hair. I have very wavy to lose ringlet curly hair if I don&#x27;t comb it out or straighten it. Be Curly whips my dull waves into tangible frizz free curls. Here is my recipe for perfect curls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash and LIGHTLY condition (heavy conditioners will weigh hair down and retard curling)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet hands and apply dime to quarter size of Be Curly to ends (no need for it close to scalp)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twirl hair on finger in 6  to 8 sections (always twirl directionally AWAY from face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let air dry - re-twirl as needed while drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finger comb ONLY - do not brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want SUPER curly hair, twist into tight ringlets, circle ringlets up to scalp and secure with a clip and dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re uncertain, go to an experience center for a free trial, where you&#x27;ll also find the product much more reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Great way to refresh your curls the next morning when you are on the go!</li>
    <li> This smells like old lady. It works well enough but I can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
    <li> Even when I use extra gel this product does not work for me. It makes my curls super frizzy. I used and now love ouidad. I didn&#x27;t like that product either until I was shown how to use it right.</li>
    <li> Between dry weather and post-pregnancy thinning, my curls have taken a beating.  Sadly, this expensive product didn&#x27;t control frizz or do much for my curls.  Aquage works better for less!</li>
    <li> I got a aveda perm and thought this would help hold the curls but the perm didn&#x27;t really take on my hair.  This product didn&#x27;t even help the natural wave in my hair so I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. Have used for years. If you want beautiful soft curls, buy this hair product!!!  It&#x27;s a 10!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know why I&#x27;m hooked on this product, but hooked I am. I slather it throughout my hair after washing. It seems to marshal hair into curls, instead of each individual hair taking its own course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be imagining that it makes any difference, but I wouldn&#x27;t skip the Be Curly slather for the world. I don&#x27;t believe this product is a substitute for conditioner. It&#x27;s an additional step in the hocus-pocus of getting wild hair to look acceptable, at least in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I use big globs of it, a tube seems to last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be Curly makes soft curls. I must confess I toughen them up a bit with Aveda Witch Hazel hairspray, in my never-ending fight against frizz. If you have control issues like me, you might want to try this combination of Aveda Be Curly and Witch Hazel hairspray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 10 years. It sounds impossible, but the stuff really does make your hair curlier. You put it on wet/damp hair (don&#x27;t rinse) and as it dries, it shrinks and tightens your natural wave or curl (it won&#x27;t make straight hair curly). This is great when you&#x27;re growing out a short cut ... it prevents the poofy look. Adds texture and intensified curl with longer hair, esp. with a layered cut. I put it on after showering then wrap my hair in a towel for 5 minutes or so.     SECRET for CURLY GIRLS: NEVER BRUSH or COMB your curly hair (even if you don&#x27;t use Be Curly). Scrunch/pat the wet curls then DON&#x27;T TOUCH YOUR HAIR AGAINI!! Brushing or combing you will ruin the curl and make the hair frizzy.       This stuff is so popular that it&#x27;s always sold out in all the salons in my area.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy, but very thin hair.  I was hoping for more body since this product is supposed to enhance curls.  Still have no body, and curls were not enhanced.  Expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years!  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I changed my mind about this curl enhancer.  I think it&#x27;s from an old batch.  I ordered from Aveda website bc it was on sale. It was a different color tube.  It runs rings around the one from Amazon.  I wasn&#x27;t aware of the difference between them until I used the one from Aveda.  So much better!  Curls are popping like crazy.</li>
    <li> For some background: I have long, fine curly hair that frizzes easily and lots of times the hair on the underside of my head doesn&#x27;t curl until the very bottom, it just frizzes up and obscures the rest of the hair that is curly.  I would look at pictures of me and even if I dressed nicely and had great makeup, my hair was always the sore spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out about this product because I got my hair done at an Aveda salon.  First my stylist used [[ASIN:B004M6GTHQ Aveda Be curly Style-Prep 3.4 oz]] before adding this product, then created curls with her fingers and blow-dried using an infuser.  I got to see how the product works long-term because she gave me samples to take home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I don&#x27;t have to use tons of it like I do with the cheap stuff, plus it works immensely better.  My hair is shiny and manageable and so soft I can barely stop touching it when it&#x27;s just been washed.  The hair on the underside of my head still doesn&#x27;t curl like I want it to but it doesn&#x27;t frizz anymore and I discovered that scrunching it with a bit of gel when I&#x27;m setting my style helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I rediscovered my curls after using these Aveda products.  I highly recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s tired of having unmanageable curls and longs to have great hair in pictures like I did!</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t have really tight curls my hair tends to be frizzy, especially when the weather is humid. This product stops the frizzes and makes my curly hair curl in shiny ringlets. I use it every time I shampoo now and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. I also use the Aveda Be Curly Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I usually have 2c hair, and i&#x27;ve tried so many products that would produce fine results.  I just had no idea what my curly hair potential really was until I tried this product!  My husband got this free for me from the salon with some deal.  I tried it without any expectations, and i absolutely LOVED my hair, I was shocked.  This product completely got rid of my frizz, and really did ENHANCE my curls.  I have beautiful ringlets now, I never knew my hair could do that!  Imagine that, a product that actually DOES what it says.  Needless to say, I&#x27;ve found my holy grail.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Felt stiff in my hair and didn&#x27;t seem to enhance my curls in the least.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when I couldnt find my usual Aveeno , and after reading the good reviews. My hair is shoulder length, blonde thick and curly. My other product makes my curls and waves bouncy and alive. This product just made my hair limp and lifeless. I&#x27;ll have to use this up, since i spent so much on it. It is NOT worth the price. I also bought the shampoo thinking the combo would give great results, but I was very disappointed.  Save your money, and don&#x27;t waste it on this product!</li>
    <li> This product smells great, light weight, and leaves my hair with a natural curl! I think it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have wavy highlighted hair and it can be really frizzy sometimes. My stylist recommended this product to me and I love it. I apply after I get out of the shower and when my hair is slightly damp. I let my hair dry naturally everyday and it works like a charm! I never have frizz anymore!</li>
    <li> Great for wavy and curly hair not sticky or hard... dime size for shoulder lenth very wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair after running out of my regular product. I have short wavy hair that I scrunch up after washing.  This did not hold the curl. It looks greasy and flat.  I am going to throw it away.  I recommend you try RECOIL Curl activator by AG.  My hair stylist introduced it to me years ago and I love it.  It holds the curl well for several days.  It is not stiff or greasy.  After moving to another state I have to bring it with me when I get my hair cut.  The stylists have never heard of it and are very impressed.</li>
    <li> Defines curls, eliminates frizz. But use a little less than they recommend, as too much can be a little stiff.</li>
    <li> ...because a lot of the 1 and 2 star reviews are from people who completely ignored who this product is for.  If your hair is straight, wavy, thin, flat, limp, any of it...this isn&#x27;t going to work.  This is not a magic serum that makes straight hair bouncy and curly and vibrant.  The reason people complain about it being greasy/heavy is simply because they have the wrong type of hair for the product.  I feel like people hear &amp;#34;curl enhancer&amp;#34; and they think &amp;#34;this will make my hair curly&amp;#34;.  Nope.  Here&#x27;s what this product ACTUALLY does:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have CURLY hair, and I mean *ringlets* bare minimum, it will make it significantly less frizzy, add moisture, shine, and bounce.  Your hair will hold, not frizz out, and look great for several hours.  Thanks to this product, I can &amp;#34;maintain&amp;#34; my style for 10-12 hours by simply wetting my hands and running them through my hair each time I use the washroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again, if your hair isn&#x27;t CURLY and DRY...DON&#x27;T BUY THIS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair IS curly, frizzy, poofy, out of control, and you have no idea how to love your curls again?  Buy this, it&#x27;s a life saver.  I went from spending 40 minutes a day on my hair desperately straightening, and thanks to this product I spend 5.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for ever. Better than any other thing I have tried, Would recommend to friends. If you want my feed back don&#x27;t tell me how many words I have to write!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product is awesome. May be pricey fof some but it lasts for a while.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep my wavy hair bouncing without frizz</li>
    <li> This is a great product, does more than it says!  A friend of mine has very thick curly hair and she loves it.  For me, though, my hair is finer, and this had too much enhancer in it, weighing my hair down.  I&#x27;m sticking to 5 stars because this helps curly hair so much, it deserves 5 stars, even if it&#x27;s too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Brace yourself, Aveda products are expensive.  My wife of course thinks they are worth every penny.  As I am the guy who purchases them as gifts I too become worth every penny.  So I recommend the product and the repercussions due a man having made a smart buy.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed -- flatened my curls.  Seems not enough moisturizer in there for me.  Have thinner vs thick hair, and therefore curls can&#x27;t be weighed down.  Wasn&#x27;t heavy like other products but in this case seemed to dry out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now stuck with expensive tube that is useless for me ;(</li>
    <li> I have straighter hair but when applied and blown out and curled, I have bouncy wavy hair. The shine on my colored hair is great. I will continue to buy in the future.</li>
    <li> The best for curly hair!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t seem to make the curls defined or defrizz very well.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Cheaper on the Aveda website:$23. Not sure if this is a resale here or what, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon but some sellers are actually resellers so we have to watch. Aveda website has a good video re this product.&lt;br /&gt;***GREAT PRODUCT THO!! My hair only needs this curly encouragement &amp; this product is REALLY great.</li>
    <li> I love this product when I decide to wear my hair curly! Aveda be curly enhancer won&#x27;t leave your hair feeling crunchy or sticky.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and dry. This product makes my hair shinny and helps control the curls...really works. It was recommended by a top stylist in San Francisco.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have WAVY hair, not curly ringlets like I wish I had! lol we always wish for that we do not have. . . My hair is very coarse and thick and I am 50% gray now, although I color and highlight my hair.  I have used this product for years and years and it is the ONLY product that enhances my waves and keeps it from going totally flat.  I love, love, love it.  So, all you folks with coarse, wavy hair, you MUST give Aveda Curl Enhancement a try!  You&#x27;ll never go back to what you were using!</li>
    <li> Great for perking up curls and settling frizz.  Love the smell and the feel.  I use it after shampooing and before adding Boing for volume.  Air dry is best.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I tried this for 2 months with out any curl enhancement.  It may be a good conditioner and does smell good, but it does not help my curls.</li>
    <li> Love this.  With Aveda Be Curly Prep first.  Soft hair, soft curls for wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve had so far and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair products over the years. My hair dresser recommend it after my last haircut and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. It gives good curl definition and control, it&#x27;s not sticky and it keeps my hair soft and not crunchy. Frizz control could be better but nothing is perfect...</li>
    <li> Love this!  I use it daily to revive curls.</li>
    <li> Ever since dating an Aveda stylist I&#x27;ve been a loyal supporter of the brand.  I have tight, natural curls that get me many complements.  Aveda was always my secret weapon.  It smells great, yet somehow exotic.  A quick wash and a healthy amount of this Be Curly and I was good to go (after waiting two hours for my hair to dry).  For ten years this was the only product I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I&#x27;ve tried branching out.  I&#x27;m not African American, but I thought I&#x27;d try some of the products designed specifically for their hair to see what it did to my curls.  I let my Aveda run out and kept forgetting to order another tube.  In the meantime, I developed a new routine and my hair looked great as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally got around to ordering more Be Curly and added it in for the first time in a while, I was surprised to see how much it weighed down my hair.  I prefer for my curls to go in all directions but with the Aveda my curls were sort of limp.  My hair wasn&#x27;t nearly as soft as it had been with the new products I had been using.  Suddenly, I&#x27;m finding myself spending a great amount of time messing with my hair before I feel like it&#x27;s suitable to go out with, and even then I&#x27;m not as proud as I once was of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to say it, but I think my ten year relationship with Aveda has run its course.  I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed or what, but it just isn&#x27;t doing it for me anymore.</li>
    <li> A little on the heavy side.</li>
    <li> this helps my hair have body so it is a good product I still wish it to find it cheaper cost is important</li>
    <li> better for shorter hair...longer hair needs way to much product</li>
    <li> This product leaves my curls soft and not crunchy. It is expensive so I tried to other products. But I came back to it because it really works well for me. Some hair salons in town have this bottle for $5 less. I hope Amazon brings down the price.</li>
    <li> Lasts for days if you want it to....just scrunch with a little water.  I&lt;br /&gt;ve tried cheaper products from Sally&lt;br /&gt;s but there is no comparison....&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive but you don&lt;br /&gt;t need much for it to work.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like how lightweight this product is and that it has a light scent. I use it on my 23 month old who has 3a/3b hair. It defines her curls really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky. Unfortunately, the 3b portion of my daughter&#x27;s hair is really dry and this doesn&#x27;t do much to add moisture where it is needed most. Without the added moisture, that section of hair sticks straight out--and I do mean straight. I&#x27;ve been adding a drop of olive oil to her hair and then applying the curl enhancer. The result is well defined curls all over her head.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have that funky kind of hair that is in between wavy and curly and alot of hair per square inch but fine.  I am also middle-aged so there is dryness.  All of that equals - frizzy dry mess.  Be Curly Enhancer tames my crazy mane and makes it look fabulous.  I can do without alot of things, but I cannot do without this product.  It does not weigh down my fine hair, just moisturizes it and brings out the curl.  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Love it! It enhances the curls beautifully!</li>
    <li> THis is my favorite curl enhancer product out of many I&#x27;ve tried.  Mixing this with a cheaper drugstore brand spray leads to a reasonable value overall to take great care of my curls!</li>
    <li> Crack for my curls. I have fine curly hair (mix of 2c/3a) that responds really well to this cream. Word of advice, though. It&#x27;s NOT a styling cream, so you will still need to style per usual. It also works best for me when my hair is damp, and added with my go-to gel. Without the gel I can still get some definition but definitely not as much.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have super fine, bendy hair. the Curl enhancer helps my hair have more uniform curls without getting crunchy like gels or greasy like other leave in conditioners. You can get it for $23 online at Aveda...</li>
    <li> Just have to say I get it for about seven dollars less at my salon.  I really like this product. I have thick, wavy, elbow-length hair and during the rainy season in the summer I use this to tame my wild mane.</li>
    <li> It gives volume on my thin hair. It meets my expectation</li>
    <li> Reduces frizz and pumps up the curl.  Love how my hair feels with this product.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or cause any problems.</li>
    <li> Best I ever used.  This will be my product for the future.</li>
    <li> This seems to do the trick without making my hair stiff.  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.  Makes more wave than curl.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to be educated in an Aveda store by an associate who knew her stuff! I told her I was looking for a product that helped hair such as mine: frizzy and curly/wavy without form most of the time, and pretty curly/wavy when it wants to be (1 or 2 times a month...). She recommended the &amp;#34;be curly&amp;#34; line and even had me try it in the store. Having used moose before to keep my waves tight throughout the day, I was unhappy with the gunky heavy feel that moose gave my hair. Be curly felt incredibly light and was virtually non-weighted once it dried. My hair looked much much curlier/wavier than it ever has, and there was no frizz! I was so impressed! I was also angry for having taken 2 decades to find this product. I naturally jumped on Amazon and subscribed to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you can apply this product when your hair is post-shower-wet, I recommend applying it when your hair has dried a bit and is more damp rather than wet. When your hair is just damp, the product seems to make your curls much bouncier and bodied, as opposed to limper and flatter if applied when completely wet. Just a suggestion. But you can always try both ways to see what works best with your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my intense satisfaction with this product, I decided to buy their shampoo and conditioner in the same Be Curly line- reviews coming soon!</li>
    <li> I love this product I don&#x27;t have curly hair but I use it to make my hair wavy and it looks fabulous. I have a question why are you charging $32.00. Aveda sales the same product for $22.00</li>
    <li> Best thing for curly hair I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> Love Aveda shampoo and conditioner products for my curly hair. This is a great leave in conditioner that gives my curls definition without being greasy and weighing them down. Light clean smell,</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite product for enhancing curls.</li>
    <li> I love this product as well.  After shampooing and conditioning my hair, I use this enhancer.  And even though my hair curls after shampooing and conditioning it, I use this enhancer to lock in the curls and they stay the whole day.  This product is not gooey or greasy.  That&#x27;s what I really like about it.  Thank you Aveda for these products.  I absolutely love all three, shampoo, conditioner and enhancer.  Once you use these products two or three times, your hair automatically curls when you even shampoo it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best! So lightweight, smoothed my curls and wears all day!</li>
    <li> I love this product, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I have curly, frizzy, thin hair and this product does wonders to smooth out the frizziness and give an appearance of a fuller head of hair that feels great.  The issue is with the pricing on Amazon.  I know this is an associate seller, but you can buy this product for $27.00 including shipping on the Aveda website.  It&#x27;s listed there for $22.00.  It&#x27;s worth the inconvenience of having to enter shipping and payment information to save almost 30%.  This seems to be a seller taking advantage of Amazon&#x27;s great reputation for offering the most competitive price.</li>
