### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The smell of this vanilla EO is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>It has made a wonderful smelling hand cream.  </li>
      <li>This product works great for homemade scrubs!</li>
      <li>But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s scent is a beautiful addition to almost anything</li>
      <li>If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you!</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Seems good for putting in scent containers to warm with a candle...gives a nice scent!  </li>
      <li>Received WAY before estimated date of arrival, smells kind of like cooking Vanilla, use it in a difuser with cinnamon oil, smells amazing!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the result.</li>
      <li>Love the smell!</li>
      <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong lingering vanilla scent like I thought it would when diffused in the air.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair smell amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Vanilla it is a popular aroma and it is well known for</li>
      <li>It does smell nice,</li>
      <li>It was sticky on the skin and did not have a nice vanilla scent.</li>
      <li>It is strong and good quality.</li>
      <li>It is suitable.</li>
      <li>I love all of Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.</li>
      <li>Love it and definitely glad I got the 30 ml bottle :)</li>
      <li>Ok, I tried using this to scent lotion bars and lip balms.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this</li>
      <li>it seems to be more like vanilla flavoring for cooking.  </li>
      <li>Not as strong as the stuff I bought in the 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>It does not have the strong fragrance that I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>After a stressful ,full working day  , I really enjoyed a relaxing evening using this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If that is not an issue for you, then this product is fine.</li>
      <li>But for this kind of price you can&#x27;t ask for much.</li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>Stains and is not strong smelling, but if you are looking for something like that it is perfect</li>
      <li>Price was very reasonable, shipping was fast and cost effective, and oil works</li>
      <li>Smells great when added to other oils as well.  </li>
      <li>If you love vanilla, you will love this essential oil!</li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>After much searching locally, I was happy to find vanilla online and at such a good price!I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few of Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils and have felt they are great quality for the price.</li>
      <li>This company&#x27;s oils that I have purchased in the past have been great, but this one isn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>Wonderfull highly concentrated natural product with odour of paradise... :-)</li>
      <li>This is my first first purchase from Edens Garden.</li>
      <li>It took way more than what should have been necessary to scent a bath with this product.  </li>
      <li>My oil arrived quickly from seller and smells amazing, not too strong and not too weak.</li>
      <li>product really offers what it should offer: it has a rich aroma of vanilla , having a really relaxing</li>
      <li>I have been using Edens Garden essential oils for years and have been very pleased, but this is not the same quality.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, not 100% pure.</li>
      <li>and I have worn it straight and received compliments on my perfume.</li>
      <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
      <li>this is a brown liquid and has a subtle scent which is nice though.</li>
      <li>Originally purchased oil for my mom, it&#x27;s supposed to help you sleep when mixing with other relaxing smells.</li>
      <li>Its was a huge waste of money...do not buy.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised that the oil is super dark</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping for a nice vanilla scent, it is SO weak, weaker than my regular vanilla extract &amp; it does not blend with REAL essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I use this as to support the aroma of another vanilla oil I bought, which is much sweeter and full-bodied than this one.</li>
      <li>as far as i know essential oils were, well oils.</li>
      <li>apparently what i bought before</li>
      <li>This might be good for a very very small bedroom, but definitely not for anything larger than a bedroom, unless you want to use the half a bottle everytime you use it.</li>
      <li>We bought the 14-pack of other oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden and liked them, but this one was a major fail...</li>

<li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>

<li> I could tell when I first opened it and the scent did not hit me that it was way too weak.</li>
<li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
<li> The little particles of vanilla &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; seperated and sunck and just floated around when mixed..speckling my items with dark beads of fluid that just came off all over your hands!</li>
<li> dark in color , smells terriffic</li>
<li> Note that this product&#x27;s color has not been filtered out, so it&#x27;s dark like molasses  as vanilla should be; and will slightly tint your handmade creams.</li>
<li> so I am am a little concerned that it may discolor fabric.</li>
<li> I mix a few drops into a homemade hair concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and moroccan oil.</li>
<li> im still not sure about this one.</li>
<li> maybe next time ill just buy the ones in a carrier oil.</li>
<li> &gt; - we use it in an organic insect repellent of vanilla, citronella, cinnamon bark, euchalyptus, and tea tree oils in a vodka base - works nicely for mosquitoes, flies, and ticks</li>
<li> This vanilla scent was incredibly weak...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product has some bad reviews about the smell being \\&quot;not strong enough?\\</li>
<li> The scent is very weak and it almost doesn&#x27;t even smell like vanilla.</li>
<li> Maybe they got a bad batch?  </li>
<li> So they don&#x27;t just have a bad product but also bad customer service.</li>
<li> I was disappointed in this item.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with this product.  </li>

    <li> After a stressful ,full working day  , I really enjoyed a relaxing evening using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla it is a popular aroma and it is well known for it&#x27;s therapeutic and aphrodisiac properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really offers what it should offer: it has a rich aroma of vanilla , having a really relaxing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one .!</li>
    <li> I ordered this essential oil for making soap.  When I went to mix my essential oils this vanilla sank like a stone.  I have been using Edens Garden essential oils for years and have been very pleased, but this is not the same quality.  I am very disappointed with this product.  It should not be labeled an essential oil when it is not an oil at all.</li>
    <li> dark in color , smells terriffic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product has some bad reviews about the smell being \\&quot;not strong enough?\\&quot;  Maybe they got a bad batch?

    <li> The advertising would have you believe that this product is 100% essential oil, but it is not. It&#x27;s oil in a carrier liquid.  Therefore, not 100% pure. It does smell nice, if that&#x27;s all you care about, that&#x27;s why I gave it two stars.</li>
    <li> It took way more than what should have been necessary to scent a bath with this product.  I will not buy again.</li>

    <li> This oil did not work well for laundry products. The scent is very weak and it almost doesn&#x27;t even smell like vanilla. We bought the 14-pack of other oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden and liked them, but this one was a major fail...</li>
    <li> I bought Vanilla oil from Edens Garden to mix with my hand cream.  It has made a wonderful smelling hand cream.  I am very pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> as far as i know essential oils were, well oils. i bought some vanilla essential oil before and it looked like an oil and smelled stronger. this is a brown liquid and has a subtle scent which is nice though. after doing research apparently what i bought before was fragrance oil not essential oil. i use this in my body creams. maybe next time ill just buy the ones in a carrier oil. im still not sure about this one.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Wonderfull highly concentrated natural product with odour of paradise... :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few of Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils and have felt they are great quality for the price. I would put them up to other larger name companies running around selling at double/triple the price.</li>
    <li> This is my first first purchase from Edens Garden. I use EOs for body products and home fragrance. I was surprised that the oil is super dark so I am am a little concerned that it may discolor fabric.</li>
    <li> I think this product meets its expectations... It smells like Vanilla. I mix a few drops into a homemade hair concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and moroccan oil. It makes my hair smell amazing.</li>
    <li> Ok, I tried using this to scent lotion bars and lip balms. It does not even seem oil based, and does not mix well at all! The little particles of vanilla &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; seperated and sunck and just floated around when mixed..speckling my items with dark beads of fluid that just came off all over your hands!</li>
    <li> it seems to be more like vanilla flavoring for cooking.  Not an essential oil.</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in the making of soaps, lotions and perfumes. It&#x27;s scent is a beautiful addition to almost anything and I have worn it straight and received compliments on my perfume. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The smell of this vanilla EO is wonderful!  It is strong and good quality. I love all of Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.</li>
    <li> I purchased to use in an aromatherapy diffuser. I had to use A LOT of this product to produce a scent that you could even smell. This might be good for a very very small bedroom, but definitely not for anything larger than a bedroom, unless you want to use the half a bottle everytime you use it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Seems good for putting in scent containers to warm with a candle...gives a nice scent!  Not as strong as the stuff I bought in the 1980&#x27;s.  But, that&#x27;s life.  It is suitable.</li>
    <li> This product works great for homemade scrubs!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this item. It was sticky on the skin and did not have a nice vanilla scent. I tried putting it with a carrier oil, but that did not change the stickiness. The company did finally cooperate and give me a refund.</li>
    <li> This vanilla scent was incredibly weak...it had no staying power in a diffuser at all. I could tell when I first opened it and the scent did not hit me that it was way too weak. This company&#x27;s oils that I have purchased in the past have been great, but this one isn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
