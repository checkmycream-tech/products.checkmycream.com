      <li>good product for the price .</li>
      <li>I have had this for about two years now and is still in good shape - warming towels at night.</li>
      <li>Good value and good design.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get very warm at all, need to put it on two cycles to get warm.</li>
      <li>Over all very pleased and loved it.</li>
      <li>Takes 20 minutes to warm up then automatically shuts off so towels don&#x27;t get warm at all!</li>
      <li>For the price I think it&#x27;s a really good deal if you like warm towels after your bath / shower.  </li>
      <li>I loved the idea of having warm towels when getting out of the shower but not having to use the dryer.</li>
      <li>The machine works as advertised, it does take a while to warm the towels, but does a nice job, good temperature.  </li>
      <li>He loves it and I am extremely pleased with this purchase!</li>
      <li>Better off warming in your dryer for 3 minutes than waiting 20 minutes for something that doesn&#x27;t work anyway!</li>
      <li>Nothing better than a warm towel after a shower!  </li>
      <li>We use it to warm the towels while we are in the hot tub in the winter and its perfect!</li>
      <li>So nice to have a warm towel when you get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>After showers and baths I have to have my warm towel.</li>
      <li>Was expecting that warm towel feeling like when it comes out from the dryer</li>
      <li>In just minutes, a bath towel becomes warm and toasty.  </li>
      <li>heat mittens/gloves, caps, neck scarves, socks and anything else that will keep you or your children  warm during the winter.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t listen to these people who tell you it takes forever to warm up your towels</li>
      <li>starts her day out nice.  </li>
      <li>Bought for my dad so he would stop using a floor heater to warm his towels, and he loves it</li>
      <li>But it does warm the towel up with an added softness.  </li>
      <li>I even throw my lotion in with my towel to warm it up, too.  </li>
      <li>Got this thing for my wife, and she, obligingly liked it... or liked the idea of it.  </li>
      <li>He jams a lot of stuff in there before his shower and comes out to warm towels, pj&#x27;s, underpants, undershirt, throw blanket...and even his stuffed animal.</li>
      <li>She puts her towel in before her shower and by the time she&#x27;s done her towel is nice and toasty.</li>
      <li>The warm feeling was lost almost immediately.</li>
      <li>you basically need to hit it twice to get a luke warm towel</li>
      <li>I had been using a crockpot to warm towels for my massage clients and had been waiting for this product to come off backorder.</li>
      <li>The problem with this warmer is that it takes about 20 minutes to warm one towel and it must be opened and dropped into the heater.</li>
      <li>Pop the towel in, hit the button and a warm towel is waiting after the shower.  </li>
      <li>For those of you like myself, who don&#x27;t take 20 minutes showers, don&#x27;t get this - your towels won&#x27;t be warm in time.</li>
      <li>I have used it to warm towels in the bathroom and agree you can&#x27;t put them in rolled up.</li>
      <li>Even then it doesn&#x27;t get really warm; it is nothing like a towel from the dryer if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>Towels are usually fairly warm.</li>
      <li>Still nice to use when getting out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;the towels are warm though</li>
      <li>and it can&#x27;t be nicely rolled or it won&#x27;t get warmed all of the way.</li>
      <li>and she has used it over and over hoping that it will get warm.  </li>
      <li>It fits there nicely and is close to the shower.  </li>
      <li>She lets it get warm for 45 mins and still nothing.  </li>
      <li>This product will get your towels nice and toasty.  </li>
      <li>The gifted towel warmer were loved by all.</li>
      <li>This item has turned out to be quite handy.  </li>
      <li>And, the added luxury of those warm delicates...</li>
      <li>Towel warmer efficiently warmed towels in a cost effective and space saving manner.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have time for it to adequately warm the towel.</li>
      <li>I ended up returning it because no matter what I did it just never got my towel remotely warm.</li>
      <li>What a nice touch to have warm socks to put on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so nice and toasty...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. It was cheaper than the others and works great for her. It takes a decent bit longer when you put 2 towels in, but still heats up okay.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get them really really hot and only holds two towels but would probably work better with just one towel.  I bought it for use after getting out if our jacuzzi. 👊</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this appliance. With two large towels rolled up it heated them thoroughly in the time it took to take a shower. Highly recommend for everyone in the family</li>
    <li> My 11 year old son bought this for himself with his own money! He wanted it, so I researched the best option for a towel warmer and this item received great reviews. The price was right and it is much better than the towel warmers you hang your items over. It is self contained and shuts off automatically if he forgets. He jams a lot of stuff in there before his shower and comes out to warm towels, pj&#x27;s, underpants, undershirt, throw blanket...and even his stuffed animal. He loves it and I am extremely pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I Purchased this as a gift to my parents for their outdoor hot tub and not only do they love it, it arrived faster than expected!</li>
    <li> The towel warmer does what it is advertised to do. In the coldest of winter days, coming out of the hot water into an instant chill is now a thing of the past. I wrap myself from the waist down with the first one and then upper body with the second one and life becomes good.</li>
    <li> This is a luxurious item, IF you&#x27;d ask me.  I not only warm up my towels in the morning, but also warm up my nightgown and soft plush socks at night too!</li>
    <li> I had high expectations of this product, based on some of the other reviews. My experience with it so far has been far less satisfying. The unit takes about 20-minutes to warm up. Who has time to take a 20-minute shower? I did connect it to a timer to overcome the heating time but still found the towels to be luke warm. If you try two thick towels, it only warms the outside. I&#x27;ve tried three different types of towels with the same result. Inserting a single towel, crumpled in the base works best, works best but still not great. I really expected warm towels--not towels with warm edges.</li>
    <li> This item has turned out to be quite handy.  The interior is quite large enough to hold either two standard towels or one bath sheet, plus underclothes, socks and a robe.  Do not be mislead by those products that say they can hold \\&quot;20 towels,\\&quot; as they are referring to small hand towels as might be used in a beauty shop.  Here are some alternative ways to use this item:  1)  PRE-BEDTIME:  If you have just exercised and plan to go to bed after bathing, put the following items inside in the following order:  robe on the bottom,  then pajamas, under garments, socks, and towel on top.  You will find the towel quickly loses heat in the open air as you are drying off (don&#x27;t forget to close the lid to keep the other items warm while you towel off); the other items stay warm much longer than your towel.  After turning the unit on to heat up,  do your post-exercise stretches, brush your teeth, then shower or tub.  The unit will have had plenty of time to warm your garments, and you will emerge clean, and warming your muscles after exercise.  This \\&quot;warm-down\\&quot; routine is highly motivating to do the exercise, but it obviously also works if you are too tired to work out and just want to sink into bed warm and relaxed.  2)  IF YOU PLAN TO GO OUT IN CASUAL CLOTHES AFTER BATHING:  Put your slacks, shirt or sweatshirt, undergarments, socks, and towel in the unit and turn it on.  Do whatever other pre-bath/shower preparations you wish (floss, brush your teeth), then shower or tub.  Your clothes will be wonderfully warm once you&#x27;ve dried off, especially if you are going out in cold weather.  3)  GIVE YOUR LITTLE ONES A TREAT:  Put your toddler&#x27;s robe, slippers (with soles on a paper towel), socks, and a favorite small stuffed toy on the bottom of the unit, then their pajamas and underwear topped by the towel (loading the unit can be done anytime during the day) and turn on the heat about 15 minutes before bathing them.  Tub your little ones and let them know that a special treat is coming with toasty warm bedclothes to wear and a warm toy to hug while you read them a bedtime story.  This routine may just make bath time less of a chore because of anticipating the warm towel, bedclothes, toy and story that follow.  Just for safety sake, keep this unit out of the reach of children and unplug after use. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d try warming a baby&#x27;s clothes because of their very tender skin.  4)  I don&#x27;t know how practical this idea is, but if you have time,  warm the unit and your cold weather gear before going out in the cold: heat mittens/gloves, caps, neck scarves, socks and anything else that will keep you or your children  warm during the winter.  Remember that any metal objects (buttons, studs) on clothing can become very warm, so check those out the first time you try this.  Fabric buttons should be OK.  I understand that these units can be PUT ON AN AUTOMATIC TIMER, so you can set everything up the night before, and everything will be warming during breakfast, tooth brushing, hair and make-up.  I have my unit set to one  side  of a vanity  plugged into a GFI outlet; it does not impinge on the sink at all.  My bathroom is configured so that the shower is directly across from the sink, so I step out onto a bathmat and can reach over to the unit to get the towel and other items once I&#x27;m dry.  This unit  is stable and, of course, portable; e.g.,  if you just want to warm up your robe and pajamas--even a small pillow like a neck roll--in the bedroom (especially if you&#x27;re under the weather) or watching TV anywhere.  If you want to heat lightweight slippers, put a paper towel under the soles to keep the unit clean.  The unit will fit on a night stand or end table and turns itself off automatically.  Don&#x27;t leave this unit where a child might knock it over or play with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this off of Groupon roughly 7 months ago. It&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s never really been great at heating up towels during my shower. The warmer takes 20 minutes to fully heat the towel (**taken from the above product description -  The convenient 20-minute warm up time is perfect for your morning showers**).  It seems the designers of this product think that people take 20 minute showers in the morning before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for people who are on the fence about buying this. If you take 20 minute showers, then buy this - it&#x27;s perfect for you. For those of you like myself, who don&#x27;t take 20 minutes showers, don&#x27;t get this - your towels won&#x27;t be warm in time.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice looking machine.  Gave it to my wife as a gift.  Unfortuately it only warmed half of the towel while the other half remained cool.  Also, the towel  cooled down too quickly defeating the purpose of the machine.</li>
    <li> Im really into self comfort and the need to feel snuggled and cozy at every turn these days, this is perfect, you can&#x27;t beat getting out the shower into a warm towel. I&#x27;ve even put in a damp(not drippy wet) cloth for a nice facial or massage rub down.</li>
    <li> a great product and wonderful price ...I will always consider using amazon...and Conair  products The gifted towel warmer were loved by all.</li>
    <li> I love to have my towel, pajamas and robes heated in the winter after taking a shower. However, it doesn&#x27;t heat enough for me. Also it should stay on longer before it automatically turns off.</li>
    <li> Does not even heat anything</li>
    <li> This thing heats the towel to the desired level for only a few minutes.  If you don&#x27;t time your shower to the time you turn it on just right, you either get a barely warm towel or worse a wet one from the condensation of leaving it in too long.  Buyers remorse on this one.  And its bigger than it looks.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this, because it got what seemed, the best ratings would warm the towels for our winter excursions to our outdoor hot tub, but it didn&#x27;t unless the cycle was run twice.  This also meant I had to catch and reset at exactly the time it went off the first heating cycle. Walking through the snow to the hot tub was easier.</li>
    <li> It has been a wonderful addition to our household.  My daughter and I fight over who gets to  keep it in their bathroom. I am thinking of ordering another one so that we don&#x27;t have to anymore.</li>
    <li> I remodeled my bathroom about 2 years ago and did not have enough money in the budget for a wall mounted towel warmer rack. I got some extra money for Christmas this year and decided to start looking at towel warmers. As I was reading reviews I saw that a lot of people that had spent $100 to $300 on the wall-mounted towel warmer racks were disappointed in them because they only warm the part of the towel that sits on the bar. Then I happened across reviews for towel warmers like this one and they were very positive. This website had a great price compared to others I looked at so I decided to buy this one even though I couldn&#x27;t find very many reviews for this model (in fact, only 1!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can truly say that for the money I am amazed. This unit is SO light weight - I could definitely see traveling with it very easily. Its also big enough to hold my two large bath towels or 1 large towel and my pajamas, but it stores easily out of the way in my bathroom and the cord is long enough to move it around where ever I want it in my bathroom. It also gets my towels really hot. One suggestion - do not put the towels in it folded up or they will not get heated evenly. Unfold the towel and just drop it down in there. The longer you leave the towels in the hotter they get and the more evenly heated they are. I also like the auto shut off at 50 minutes in case I forget to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product and I am very happy with no complaints.</li>
    <li> Keep towel hot and ready when you step out of shower or tub automatic shut off in case YOU forget to turn it off</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my sister during the winter months.  She loves it!  She had no problems figuring it out and started using it the same day. She puts her towel in before her shower and by the time she&#x27;s done her towel is nice and toasty.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas a year ago.  After 28 years of marriage the woman has everything and I was having a hard time coming up with something.  A friend suggested it and so I ordered.  Now a year later she says this is still the best Christmas present ever despite some pretty pricey jewelry over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that our shower is at one end of the master bathroom and the sink and electrical outlet the other.  The cord is short so it does not reach near the shower.  However, if you heat them until ready and leave the lid closed you can unplug and move the unit and the towels will stay warm.</li>
    <li> Towel warmer worked as promised. Used it for towels and clothes. I would recommend purchasing the Conair Therma Luxe Towel Warmer.</li>
    <li> it works real good but only holds one normal size towl if you put two in they don&#x27;t warm all way threw</li>
    <li> This towel warmer is great for the cool mornings we have been having here in Minnesota.  Drying off with a warm towel is very relaxing and much more of a luxury than I was accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;  The time it requires to warm the towel is a little irritating, but the sensation of a warm towel is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I didnt know when I purchased this that you cannot keep it outside... its ok for indoor..i wanted it for a hot tub..&lt;br /&gt;the towels are warm though</li>
    <li> Never worked well . Even towels from a heated rack ,cooled off in this so called warmer. Then in less than a year , it stopped working completely. Hunk of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The towels had a humidity to them when they came out. Like coming out of a sauna instead of coming out of the dryer. And it did take a long time to warm a towel. I really do t think it could warm more than one or a towel and a robe.</li>
    <li> This product will get your towels nice and toasty.  However, you need to make sure you give them about 20 minutes to warm sufficiently.  Also you can not roll towels like shown in picture if you want to get the whole towel warm.  Your best bet is to just throw them end loosely wadded.  Holds 2 large towels comfortably.</li>
    <li> Towel warmer efficiently warmed towels in a cost effective and space saving manner. Good value and good design. An affordable luxury.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a towel warmer, so with Mother&#x27;s Day coming up, I started out researching free-standing and wall-mounted towel warmer racks/bars.  Immpression of the racks found online was of spotty function or poor quality at unreasonable prices.  Goal was a decent quality and reasonably-priced towel warmer, and found this unit.  Seems great so far. Concept of dropping the towel (we don&#x27;t roll it up, just drop it in) into an enclosed space to warm the entire towel makes more sense than a rack, and the unit takes up little space.  Has one 20-minute heating cycle, which other reviewers suggested (and the instructions hint at) starting over for best warming. We&#x27;ve done both and either way seems acceptable to my wife.  Styling is a little plain, sort of like a Rubbermaid container with a heating element, but then this is a basic-priced unit.  Overall, my wife is pleased with it, which is what matters to me.  Amazon purchase process and shipping was no problem; product arrived well packaged (Conair &#x27;factory&#x27; box inside two other boxes -- smart packaging) and on-time.  Thanks, Amazon.  Doug, Ashland, Oregon.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of having warm towels when getting out of the shower but not having to use the dryer. When this product arrived I excitedly opened it up and plugged it in to test how warm it actually got. It doesn&#x27;t warm two towels and it doesn&#x27;t warm one towel. I was greatly disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> What a great product, works are expected.  Takes a little bit to warm up but my the time you get out of the shower its warm, wait a bit longer and the towels are hot.  It makes you think why didn&#x27;t I have one before and why doesn&#x27;t everyone have it.  Enjoy it every day.</li>
    <li> This is super luxury at an affordable price! Old man winter was meaner than usual this year and this towel warmer truly took the edge off. If you appreciate the little luxuries life has to offer but, need to watch your budget this is a great addition to your life. BRAVO!!!</li>
    <li> Can only fit two towels and only warms up whatever touches the edges of the warmer.. you have to drop the towel down and only some parts get warm. Also takes forever to heat up. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again :( other than that.. The price is good for what you get</li>
    <li> I wish they would have more available!</li>
    <li> We had purchased another brand of towel warmer a year ago at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and LOVED it!  WE loved it so much that when it suddenly stopped working, we sought to buy a new one (figuring it would be cheaper than trying to fix it).  I read the reviews on this one and it did not have any bad reviews.  We got it and it in no way came close to the heating of our towels like the last one did.  Maybe we got a lemon, but our towels were slightly warm at best, never the hot we experienced with our last towel warmer.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a Christmas gift.  I love it so much that I purchased one for a friend&#x27;s birthday.  She also loves hers.  To get the warmest towel, plan ahead.  Put the towel in at least 20 minutes before you will need it.  With all of the ice and cold weather we have had, it is so nice to have a warm towel after a shower or bath!</li>
    <li> I bough this because it is the second most popular towel warmer on Amazon. I went to Brook Stone to try to smell the Brook Stone version. The smell was too strong for me so I went with this one. You need at least 20 minutes to warm the towel. I know who has 20 minutes before the shower right? My solution is the Wireless Controlled Electrical Switch Socket Outlet with Remote - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087DAW46/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, you just need to plug the towel warmer to the Wireless Controlled Electrical Switch Outlet and turn the switch on the towel warmer to on. Turn off your outlet with the remote. Then, turn on the remote 20 minutes before your shower time. Wow, it works like a charm! You can try it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I shut the remote off and on again (start the second cycle) before I take a shower to get the towel warmmmmer...</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my mother in law. She is very happy with it. Small enough to be practical in a home bathroom, but a much appreciated tool for warming blankets, towels, mittens, etc. when the weather is cold.</li>
    <li> An ok towel warmer. Had a different brand model previously that warmed much better.</li>
    <li> It was ok. You have to warm it up for at least 3 cycles for it to get warm. Just ok.</li>
    <li> The machine works as advertised, it does take a while to warm the towels, but does a nice job, good temperature.  You can put 2 towels in it, but it is tight and if you plan a bit ahead, the towels do warm very nicely.</li>
    <li> Reviews I ready ahead of time were mixed.  I put one towel (not bulky) in.  It warms the towel, but doesn&#x27;t get it HOT.  Still nice to use when getting out of the shower.  Wish I could find a better product, but all towel warmers I found on Amazon had mixed reviews no matter what price.  I will keep for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> it looks and functions just as described. the unit itself is pretty nice. i bought this for my wife for christmas, but my mom didn&#x27;t know and surprised us with a different model - ironically the other one i was going to buy. in the end, my wife picked the other unit because it warmed the towels in 10 minutes, and this one is rated at 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love this little luxury. I have used it to warm towels in the bathroom and agree you can&#x27;t put them in rolled up. However, it does a great job on a large bath towel and my microfleece nightgown. The best use yet, is to warm the clothing I am putting on at 5 in the morning. With the polar vortex and my not liking to be cold, this has be a real treat. I put everything in and turn it on. About 20 minutes later everything is wonderfully warm. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> didn´t satisfy me  its slow heating and doesn´t heat that much its a normal product .&lt;br /&gt;conair has other better productos</li>
    <li> The Conair Therma Luxe PTW! Towel Warmer warms only very faintly in an hour.  Two towels don&#x27;t work well at all. Not worth the money.  A poor gift choice for us.</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad so he would stop using a floor heater to warm his towels, and he loves it</li>
    <li> It gets the towels nice and warm but it sure takes a while. They need to be in the warmer for about 20 minutes to be warm enough to do the job</li>
    <li> GreatProduct !,  Does just what I. Want! Wife loves it too!</li>
    <li> warms towels but not enough . Was expecting that warm towel feeling like when it comes out from the dryer but this is not close.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a nice treat to order for when I get out of the tub on a cold night but now I can&#x27;t do without it. After showers and baths I have to have my warm towel. The only thing I will says is I wish it was bigger and warmed faster.</li>
    <li> Takes too long to warm up.  I probably takes two 20 minute cycles to warm the towel(s) all the way through.&lt;br /&gt;For the most part we don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> this was bought as a gift and was reported to me that she loved it.  It did take time to heat up but that could be scheduled so no&lt;br /&gt;problem.  Over all very pleased and loved it.</li>
    <li> was a gift, but did not like it so sold it on ebay. not real user friendly and would not recommend this item</li>
    <li> This is very luxurious and warms a towel delightfully warm for after a bath. Works great and looks good. This is a beloved item!</li>
    <li> it does what its suppose yo do. Folks want too much out of it .&lt;br /&gt;well made although its complete plastic.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very warm at all, need to put it on two cycles to get warm. So only one person can use it a day</li>
    <li> Donated to a local animal shelter. The shelter managers were very happy to have it.</li>
    <li> Only keeps it warm for an hour and not too hot</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend of mine and he thinks it is THE greatest thing ever! He has heart disease and gets very cold during the winter months.....He puts his jammy bottoms in it when he gets home from work and it does the magic while he is in the shower. He told me it does a perfect job in a short amount of time...he loves gadgets and this little warmer is a fav of his...I would SO recommend this! Money well spent! May God bless!</li>
    <li> This towel warmer takes forever to warm your towel..! It is okay for bath time when you have longer to let your towel warm up, but for showers in the morning, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love warm towels in the winter. I chose this towel warmer for the simplicity of design and size - enough to hold two bath towels. I have had this for about two years now and is still in good shape - warming towels at night. It also seems to use very little electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, place the towels inside the warmer at least fifteen minutes prior to having the need to use them as this machine takes a while to warm the towels. Also, make sure the inserted towels are dry, not wet, as it will take even longer to warm. Other than that, this is just a very good towel warmer overall.</li>
    <li> Does not warm towels. If the towel is kept in for at least 30 mins, it&#x27;s just a little warmer than room temp. Waste of money</li>
    <li> BOUGHT FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVES IT IN THE WINTER...SHE LIKED IT SO MUCH WE BOUGHT TWO MORE AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR A FAMILY AND THEIR TWO KIDS WHO HAVE A HOT TUB...NOTHING LIKE A WARM TOWEL WHEN YOU GET OUT OF THE HOT TUB IN THE WINTER.</li>
    <li> I was so excited I&#x27;ve wanted a towel warmer for years and with all the positive reviews on this one I decided to get it. First the pro&#x27;s. very compact, even though i have a huge bathroom this takes up little space, can fit on a counter top if needed. its sleek and not distracting by being ugly or in your face, it blends in okay with my bathroom though its done in black gold veined \\&quot;marble\\&quot; tile board from the 70&#x27;s(face it nothing matches that very well). outside is slightly warm but not hot so you won&#x27;t be burning fingers or arms or ankles if you brush up against the outside of unit. Con&#x27;s to this delightful thing are the on off is a button, not a slider switch. In my experience buttons not slider switches do not hold up to casual use.  the pretty red and green lights might be of more value on the front of the unit not the top, I don&#x27;t wanna walk over to it to see if the towel is warm or not. I get hotter towels with a hairdryer. To reheat or heat another towel the unit has to cool off, not a big deal but if you want a nice toasty towel is, since I use over sized bath sheets only one towel fits at a time.  I will assume either the reviewers have a way better heating unit in there&#x27;s or have never experienced the true luxury of a HOT towel or even a super warm towel. for roughly 45 bucks it&#x27;ll do for me, just wish it got hotter.  I would say the best use of this thing would be warming up baby jammys after a bath and the bath towel for them.</li>
    <li> Believe my wife will love this.</li>
    <li> If I leave the towel in for long enough, it definitely gets deliciously warm and retains that heat for awhile. However, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough if I just throw my towel in right before the start of my shower, and I shower first thing in the morning so I can&#x27;t put it in for extra 20-minute rounds before I shower. I&#x27;ve bought a timer to see if that helps.</li>
    <li> The item does not warm the towels enough.  They are room temp. at best.&lt;br /&gt;Please tell me how I can return it.</li>
    <li> This is the second Towel Warmer I have bought.  The first one I bought last Christmas for my daughter.  She loved it so much I just recently purchased another one for my daughter in law for her birthday.  She is due to have a baby soon so it will be great for her and the little guy!!!</li>
    <li> This model can be used with external appliance timer such as [[ASIN:B00002N5FI Intermatic Lamp and Appliance Security Timer TN111C70 with 2 On/Off Settings]].  That way you can wake up to a warm bathrobe!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected.  Bought this for my daughter and she couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Pop the towel in, hit the button and a warm towel is waiting after the shower.  Unit will automatically shutoff.</li>
    <li> As long as you have half an hour to kill before your shower, or take 30 minute showers, no problem.  Even then it doesn&#x27;t get really warm; it is nothing like a towel from the dryer if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have time for it to adequately warm the towel. I wondered what the cost was in these times of electricity going sky high.. My son loves his..</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different types of towell warmers ....and none of them worked well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS ONE DOES....I basically put a bath towell in and a smaller one in to wrap around my hair when I get out and it&#x27;s so nice and toasty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put two bath towells in, but what I have discovered is it takes a little longer than 20-30 minutes... I basically turn it on when I get up...have coffee, etc. and after an 45 minutes to an hour take them out and they are all toasty....LOVE THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> It barely warms the towel.  I tried several different towel types.  Needs at least 2 full rounds of &#x27;heat&#x27; setting to get comfortably warm. Who has time for that? Would NOT recommend</li>
    <li> Took alot longer to warm up than stated on the website. Was a christmas present and was soo disapointed that we had to retrun it.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I fell for the good reviews as well...thought I would try it...it did not work.  I tried large towels like in the picture, and even on single small towel...only the outside edges where the towels contact the warm plastic got a LITTLE warm.  Sorry Conair -- but you have made a real P.O.S. here.  I&#x27;m telling you people -- read the directions and instructions a few times, tried all cotton (best result), cotton blend, even a microfiber blanket --- waste of money.  Better off warming in your dryer for 3 minutes than waiting 20 minutes for something that doesn&#x27;t work anyway!</li>
    <li> In just minutes, a bath towel becomes warm and toasty.  I even throw my lotion in with my towel to warm it up, too.  It&#x27;s lightweight and fits in the cabinet in my vanity when not in use.  I had the towel bar type of warmer before, but only the part of the towel touching the bar would get warm.</li>
    <li> Got this thing for my wife, and she, obligingly liked it... or liked the idea of it.  She takes long showers, though.&lt;br /&gt;This gizmo does, as others have said, take a full 20 minutes to warm up a towel, and then, your towel is just about as warm as one taken out of the drier and left to cool for 10 minutes or so.  The effect is subtle, at best, and hardly worth the effort, electricity, or space on the bathroom floor.</li>
    <li> this unit does not heat up as well as it is advertised to.  you basically need to hit it twice to get a luke warm towel and you never get one that is truly hot!  wish they did not stop making the one I had for 5 years from another manufacture it was wonderful</li>
    <li> A warm towel is a wonderful thing on a cold morning.  The problem with this warmer is that it takes about 20 minutes to warm one towel and it must be opened and dropped into the heater.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL  It is so nice to get out of your bath or shower and dry off with a warm towel.</li>
    <li> towel not as warm as i expected it would be. towel placed in container as long as possible. product not as good as expected.</li>
    <li> I like it .  I did find it works much better if towels are loosely placed inside. I also put my pajamas on the bottom towel on top and it all comes out snuggly warm.</li>
    <li> I really like this towel warmer. it holds my wrap and 1 large towel. works for me:)&lt;br /&gt;glad I purchased this one.</li>
    <li> These items were gifts.  I ordered one for a birthday gift and it was welcomed into the household by everyone.  they loved it.  so I ordered one as a suprise gift for a dear friend.  She likes it so much she has put a timer on it so it heats up the towel for her morning shower.  The towel will be warmed to a wonderful temperature in about 20 minutes.  And it&#x27;s size is great for a small bathroom.</li>
    <li> Only one large towel fits in it. The descrtion says 2 towels, maybe small bath towels work. Towels could be warmer</li>
    <li> This works well enough. The heating time is 20 minutes so I have to turn it on about ten minutes before getting in the shower. Towels are usually fairly warm. Some days, the middle of the towel is less warm than others. Still fairly happy with the product and I would likely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warmer works better when there are two towels and not just one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom for Christmas with great hopes that it was going to be wonderful.  Well it wasn&#x27;t.  We have only had it since Christmas and she has used it over and over hoping that it will get warm.  It seems to get a little warm but nothing like it should.  A girlfriend of mine has a brookstone towel warmer and I was hoping that this one would preform the same.  She lets it get warm for 45 mins and still nothing.  It is a big dissappoinment and I would not recommend it.  She threw the box away and I can not return it.  I feel horrible for giving this as a gift and it doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  We have tried several different towels and blankets.....still no good.</li>
    <li> This warmer has exceeded my expectations and has been essential in making it easier to get out of the shower.  However, I have only used it with one towel (bath sheet) and not rolled up.  I fluff up the towel and put it in the warmer, and after about 15 minutes, I  rearrange the towel so the whole thing is toasty warm.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This was the cheapest and smallest towel warmer I could find, I have a small bathroom in my apartment so I gave it a shot. It looks nice and is very small compared to other warmers, but you&#x27;ll be greatly disappointed in the fact that it does not warm anything very well. I ended up returning it because no matter what I did it just never got my towel remotely warm. I ended up going for the Brookstone towel warmer it&#x27;s a lot bigger but works amazingly. The biggest difference in the two I notices was the interior of the Brookstone warmer is metal and the Conair one is plastic. This seems to make all the difference, I won&#x27;t say it feels like it just came out of the dryer, but it&#x27;s close. I even through a dryer sheet in the bottom of my so everything has a nice fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased a few of these as gifts and use one myself.  I am overall happy with the purchase.  However, I like to let the towel warmer cycle through an entire cycle.  Then, re-start to warm some more.  The longer time allows the towels (or clothes) to warm all the way through.  I can fit a large towel (bath sheet) and a regular-sized bath towel in this unit</li>
    <li> Small footprint and holds a couple of large-sized bath towels.  It does not get the towels hot, but pleasantly warm.  For the price I am pleased.</li>
    <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t close all the way when I put 2 towels in there so I usually put something weighted to hold it down. But overall, it still does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Takes 20 minutes to warm up then automatically shuts off so towels don&#x27;t get warm at all! Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a Christmas Gift for my G/F however this does not work as expected. This gets maybe luke warm at best. Not what I expected at all and extrememly disappointed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing I could have bought. My 93 year old husband was always cold when he stepped out of the shower. I now wrap him with a nice warm towel and towel dry his legs with the second towel. Make sure you layer the towels, one on top of the other. The bottom one is the warmer one. Don&#x27;t roll them up as the picture shows on the box, they won&#x27;t get adequately warm, because the heat source is at the bottom of the box. Happy showering.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for bathroom/everyday shower use. Fits 2 thick towels ( or in my case.. a towel plus a thick robe) it heats quickly and auto turns off. I have had this product for a year ... we use it a minimum of 4 times a day (4 people showering) and it hasn&#x27;t failed me once!</li>
    <li> Towels are only warmed on the part touching the wall of the heater.  The inside is still cool and it takes a long time to heat up.</li>
    <li> Very nice, we use this all last winter.  I think the grandkids might enjoy it more than we do.</li>
    <li> This is a great compact towel warmer!</li>
    <li> Pros- fairly small and easy to fit in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- not as warm as our old Brookstone one, and only holds two regular towels.</li>
    <li> Tried a couple of different towel warmers, this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried.  They should offer a wheeled cart for it as an accessory though.</li>
    <li> This is great! Plugs in, doesnt take up much space, and no crazy lightbulbs to mess with.  It fits two full size towels or more smaller size.  We use it to warm the towels while we are in the hot tub in the winter and its perfect!</li>
    <li> It was a gift and she loves, loves it.  Thanks, good product.</li>
    <li> The warmer holds two large towels. A larger warmer would be desirable, but this gets the job done. It warms up two towels when the outdoor temp is below freezing, and keeps them warm for about 45 minutes. (you can turn it back on if it goes off)</li>
    <li> This towel warmer is the best, especially living in the Northeast.  I just turn it on a few minutes before I get into the shower, crumble up my towel (it works best that way) and when I get out it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m at a spa.  So, so warm!!  You cannot beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Nothing better than a warm towel</li>
    <li> it warms the towels.they are not hot, but it is nice to grab a warm towels, it is nice that it shuts off by it self, no worries that it is on all the time</li>
    <li> Does not heat up. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product. It does not even come close to doing what it says it does. It simply does not work.</li>
    <li> The warmer does not warm up items as good as I thought it would. It does not warm up thick towels at all, but works okay for thin towels. I use this warmer for my daughters pj&#x27;s and towel after she takes a bath. My daughter enjoys it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for our anniversary. It was supposed to be a great thing for her to have warm towels, but at best they&#x27;re only Luke warm and cool off very quickly. Again I have bought a bad anniversary gift.</li>
    <li> Nothing better than a warm towel after a shower!  Pros, heats fairly quickly, will hold 2 towels if they are regular sized, and price.  Cons could be a little larger to accommodate larger, plush towels, would be nice to get a little hotter, and would be nice if there was a way to mount it so it didn&#x27;t take up counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is it&#x27;s great for the price and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It quit working after a short time.  Also, it didn&#x27;t hold a big bath sheet and it didn&#x27;t heat very well.</li>
    <li> The towel doesn&#x27;t even hold warmth long enough to get it to your body. It&#x27;s almost instantly cool again. Bought a different one, the Hot Towel Cabi - Hot Towel Warmer (HC-X) to replace it and it holds the temperature for a minute or two at least. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This towel warmer produced slightly warm towels after 30 minutes of waiting.  The parts of the towel that actually touched the sides were the only &amp;#34;warmed&amp;#34; spots.</li>
    <li> Takes SO long to warm up. Can&#x27;t just put in a towel then it be warm when you hop out 15 mins later. Takes about 45 mins to warm a towel so you have to think far ahead. And when waking up in the am... Not worth it may as well forget it.</li>
    <li> Towels barely get warm!!!!  Needs to get hotter so towels get warm and stay warm longer.  Great idea just needs work!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 87 year old mother for Christmas.  She loves it!  I plan to buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> good product for the price . this warmer warms the towels at a pretty fast rate I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a product I will recommend; however, you need to not roll the towel up, just drop it in and it will warm most of the towel, if you don&#x27;t then the towel on the inside will not get warm..</li>
    <li> Barely warms and towels cool quikly.  Returned first one hoping it was defective, second one was worse.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one.</li>
    <li> Love it for winter mornings</li>
    <li> not warm enough. towels hardly stay warm from warmer to shower.</li>
    <li> I love warm towels especially in the cooler months.  I unfold the towel first, then place it in the warmer.  The longer it stays, obviously, the warmer the towel.  I only need 20-25 minutes for it to be warm enough.</li>
    <li> And even after the long wait, the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; towel is perhaps 10 degrees warmer than room temperature; not the steaming hot towel I wanted. Returned for credit.</li>
    <li> Purchased for holiday gift but opened early to begin use at once! What a difference it makes! Two months of warm bliss daily thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physical Dimensions: Footprint is roughly 11\\&quot; x 14 1/2\\&quot;. Depth is 12\\&quot; and with lid raised total heigth is 21\\&quot; &amp; a nearly six foot cord (about 70\\&quot;) and lightweight, it&#x27;s pretty versatile. Ours sets in the corner yet it can be easily positioned to be a mere step away from the shower when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveats: At 240 watts it does NOT heat your towels to \\&quot;hot\\&quot; as a dryer would do (how could it at far less wattage? Your hair dryer uses more wattage!!). Allow up to 15 minutes to achieve preheat temperature. Thicker towels obviously aren&#x27;t as efficient at absorbing heat. Unfold your towels for maximum exposure and, if possible, rearrange the towel midway through the process. If light goes \\&quot;green\\&quot; before you&#x27;re ready for use, just switch off then back on as it reheats (light then glows red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily routine: Since our work schedules are similar, we take relay or tag team showers. One of us plugs it in and throws in the first towel while the other is doing daily exercises or prepping the coffee. Maybe 10-15 minutes later, the first person hops in the shower. At shower&#x27;s end, the first towel is ready while the second towel is placed in the warmer. The first towel is handed off to one exiting the shower. At the end of shower two the second towel is handed off and delicates are then dropped in. You can turn off at this time as residual heat tends to be adequate for warming the delicates. What a nice touch to have warm socks to put on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We find it satisfactory, given the wattage and with the workaround tips above you too can have warm towels that are sometimes more than warm. What a difference it makes from a room temperature towel that may be chilled in colder times. And, the added luxury of those warm delicates...</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  Towels do not get very hot and you have to get completely out of the shower to get your towels so your cold by then.</li>
    <li> I selected this towel warmer after reading reviews on several brands here at Amazon,  I did not have a place in my bathroom to install a wall hanging towel warmer so i decided to go with a portable one.  It is not too small and not too big.  It holds my large bath towel easily I have never tried to wart 2 towels at once and I don&#x27;t roll them up like in the picture.  I just loosely stuff the towel inside the warmer about 10 minutes before I decide to shower. If you want the towel even warmer then put it in about 15 minutes before. Sure it takes a little forethought but it&#x27;s worth it.  I set it on the top of our toilet tank for the time being.  It fits there nicely and is close to the shower.  It heats up pretty quickly and get the towels toasty warm.  I like the fact that it is portable so I can store it if I ever want to.  For the price I think it&#x27;s a really good deal if you like warm towels after your bath / shower.  I would recommend that you leave the top open for a bit after using it to let the condensation evaporate as it does leave water beads on the lid.  Overall I am very pleased with this product and I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly hard to find item in the dead of winter, except on amazon.com!&lt;br /&gt;Unit is bigger than I thought, but really only holds 1 towel. Does not fit on the back of the toilet like I&#x27;d hoped for a small bathroom. I preheat before I start the shower because it takes longer to heat than I take to shower most mornings. Sometimes do two cycles. Don&#x27;t roll the towel, but fold and wrap with most contact of towel and container.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get uniformly hot, like fresh-out-of-the-dryer feeling, but better than a towel bar warmer that only warms the part that contacts the towel.&lt;br /&gt;Safety wise, if you have kids, this is a safe product that gets warm, not hot, and sturdy for use.</li>
    <li> I had been using a crockpot to warm towels for my massage clients and had been waiting for this product to come off backorder. Sadly, I waited to be disappointed. The &#x27;warmth&#x27; of the towels never reaches a suitable temperature. They are only mildly warm, and a temp control would improve this product immensely. It&#x27;s back to the crockpot until I find a better solution</li>
    <li> Like this product would of hoped it heated the towels better but it is enough to do a quick dry nothing more save your money find something better.</li>
    <li> This won&#x27;t warm your towels beyond a simply luke-warm temperature. Even after leaving the towels in this unit for 30 min, my towel only gave me only a few seconds of warmth.  The warm feeling was lost almost immediately. I returned this (very easily done with Amazon) and ordered a different unit.</li>
    <li> My darling of a husband got me this for christmas.  It is great!!!.  It doesn&#x27;t heat your towel like that (fresh out the dryer feel).  But it does warm the towel up with an added softness.  I put a dryer sheet in mine...and sometimes re-start the towel warmer if I&#x27;m really cold that morning.  I am someone who is always cold so this was a wonderful gift for me.</li>
    <li> I recieved major &amp;#34;Brownie Points&amp;#34; giving this to my wife for Christmas along with a few luxury towels.&lt;br /&gt;It starts her day out nice.  Do it guys! Every morning she is reminded of your thoughtfulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked carefully at alot of towel warmers and concluded on this one has the better of them because it heats a towel in 20 mins. vs some (And maybe with a more appealing look such as the wall mounted chrome type) that can take 3 hours!  You have to have a timer installed if you want a warm towel in the morning - crazy!</li>
    <li> My Mother-in-Law keeps raving about this.  Any gift that we can give her that she has nothing negative to say is full of stars for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to these people who tell you it takes forever to warm up your towels so it sucks, and those who wonder who has time to take a 30 minute shower... you dont have to! turn the thing on when you wake up and give it some time! have some coffee, read the paper and then get it the f&#x27;n shower! the thing heats the towels great and is quite small but fits TWO BATH SHEETS!</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that I cannot take it in the shower with me.  I got this as a surprise for my wife at Christmas and she loved it so much that she said I could use it, too.  We put it as close to the shower as we dared, but the coolness of the bathroom just makes the wonderful warmth of the towels that much better.  At first she thought it was just a luxury that we could do without, but now you wouldn&#x27;t be able to pry it out of her reach.  It makes showering that much more to look forward to every evening.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel like I am in a health spa, what with the beautifully heated towels upon exiting the shower.  Works famously and do not even notice a smell to it that some others have mentioned.  A great purchase and one that will provide much comfort.</li>
    <li> Great product.. just wished it were a little bigger.. but.. works great, especially for getting out of my pool  in the chilly air..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only good for two small towels and doesn&#x27;t get them very warm. You might as well throw the towels in the dryer.......</li>
    <li> Great, great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful design, easy to use, safe to use. The customer feedback on this really helped me choose this product over&lt;br /&gt;another one. They were so right!</li>
    <li> Takes too long to heat up,after 15 minutes it is just warm.Would not recommend this towel warmer to any one.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Easily warms my towels for me while I am in the shower.  Just turn on and toss your towels in.  I use two towels and both will fit.  It actually seems to do better with two towels instead of one.  It has an auto shut off, which is great in case I forget to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight so you can easily move it out of the way when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others.  So nice to have a warm towel when you get out of the shower.  Nice to pamper yourself every once in a while.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be- and two bath towels don&#x27;t fit. They have to be jammed in and they aren&#x27;t warmed in the middle at all. Best for just one and it can&#x27;t be nicely rolled or it won&#x27;t get warmed all of the way.</li>
    <li> Good size - not sure how it works since it is a Christmas gift - seems a little &amp;#34;light duty&amp;#34; plastic</li>
