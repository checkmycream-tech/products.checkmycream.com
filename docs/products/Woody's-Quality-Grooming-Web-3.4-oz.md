      <li>i LOVE all the woodys products, but the web is by far the best.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>and the girl put some mystery material in my hair, but it made it look materially better.  </li>
      <li>Was looking for a replacement wax product to replace the one I&#x27;ve used for many years but went out of production and</li>

      <li>love it</li>
      <li>I will buy from again and look forward to trying more products.</li>
      <li>I love this pomade for styling my hair.  </li>
      <li>Light and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greased!</li>
      <li>Then it takes more time to brush out or spread the product over my hair.</li>
      <li>Smells ok.</li>
      <li>This product is consistently my favorite hair product on the market.</li>
      <li>Great product..really handles my wild hair..</li>
      <li>Plus the part I love best is that it gives me hair a little body and thickness.  </li>
      <li>Delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>It has good hold and leaves my hair with a nice dry look.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Woody&#x27;s products and Web is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Fantastic hold, no shine.</li>
      <li>A great alternative and cheaper then American crew Fiber.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair very soft and pliable but holds nicely.</li>
      <li>Wow I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>My stylist is jealous that I get such good deals on Amazon</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got kind of a caramel smell to it and as a guy I try to steer clear of sweet smelling products.  </li>
      <li>Looks natural, and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get good results.  </li>
      <li>Woody&#x27;s Web provides a great hold without making your hair heavy and greasy.  </li>
      <li>Purchased as a gift - it is the only kind he&#x27;ll use.</li>
      <li>For most of my adult life (I&#x27;m 28)</li>
      <li>Other Woody&#x27;s products are equally as good.</li>
      <li>Adds just the right amount of texture to hair; thickens it without making it greasy or shiny looking.  </li>
      <li>product is really easy to use; just a TINY dab on your finger, rub your hands together vigorously to spread it out, and lightly apply to your hair in parts.  </li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t designed for super hold unless you use more, but it is easy to use, smells decent and is not sticky or hard at all once applied.</li>
      <li>But about a year ago I wanted to change to a more traditional yet contemporary side part and swept over hair cut.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair that dries out easily, but using a little of this to smooth things out gives my hair a nice clean style.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve alternated between a buzz cut and the short on the sides, little longer on the top look that most guys have.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, but nothing comes close to the light control you get with this web that last all day.  </li>
      <li>But makes your face really oily which can lead to break outs.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s decent.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It is (a lot) more than I typically pay, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot each time so it lasts a few months or more.</li>
      <li>I use Web and Clay when I need even more control, like when I&#x27;m sweeping my hair back, or my hair is getting long</li>
      <li>i get lasting style all day long, in fact, the longer it is in the better my hair looks.</li>
      <li>So I tried woodys and except for the tendency to dry quickly</li>
      <li>It is thick with a lot of staying power; he has thick wavy hair and this styles it perfectly.  </li>
      <li>By far my favorite hair product, it held my hair in place the whole with out making my hair gel hard</li>
      <li>I use Woody&#x27;s Pomade daily, and it gives me a very controlled style without really changing the natural sheen of my hair.</li>
      <li>The silk fibroin gives my hair that natural shine</li>
      <li>really the only draw back</li>
      <li>This is fairly stiff, and takes the shine out of my hair, but it also holds it pretty well all day.</li>
      <li>is that if you use too much it can make your hair look a little greasy.</li>

<li> The tub lasts a long time.</li>
<li> lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I have thick, straight black hair, and gels tend to give me a shiny and crunchy look.</li>
<li> The scent is a little different.</li>
<li> The only issue is when you leave the cap open, the product gets oxidized and becomes hard and lumpy.</li>
<li> (though you do need to use it when your hair is damp, but not too wet), and keeps the beard in check too.</li>
<li> It is a matte finish, so it won&#x27;t make your hair look greasy or wet.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Since then I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that would keep my hair in place with a little bit of a shine but that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look wet, clumpy, slick, stringy, funky, or any other adjective that you&#x27;d use to describe the effect that the other hair different products I had tried had done to my hair.  </li>
<li> And to think I never knew about it until I opened a Woody&#x27;s pink underwear/shampoo/web combo pack for Christmas a few years ago.</li>
<li> (it smells a little like s&#x27;mores or something).</li>
<li> I now use Paul Michell green tea extract</li>
<li> It gives a little sheen without making your hair look slick.  </li>
<li> Came in so dry useless</li>
<li> you AT LEAST GIVE IT A TRY.&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick, wavy and wanted to let it grow out a bit.</li>
<li> only complaint is the price, which is outrageous.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great for your melon follicles! I have been using Woody&#x27;s Styling Web since 2014 and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Wow I love this stuff!  My barber used some the last time I got a haircut and it made my hair look so great! For most of my adult life (I&#x27;m 28) I&#x27;ve alternated between a buzz cut and the short on the sides, little longer on the top look that most guys have.  But about a year ago I wanted to change to a more traditional yet contemporary side part and swept over hair cut. (Think Ryan Gosling, David Beckham, etc.)  Since then I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that would keep my hair in place with a little bit of a shine but that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look wet, clumpy, slick, stringy, funky, or any other adjective that you&#x27;d use to describe the effect that the other hair different products I had tried had done to my hair.  I&#x27;d tried 10-12 balms, rubs, texturizing pastes, waxes, etc. and none had given me the look I was going for.  This stuff holds well but you can still run your fingers through your hair.  It gives a little sheen without making your hair look slick.  Plus the part I love best is that it gives me hair a little body and thickness.  This stuff works so well I suggest if you&#x27;re here reading the reviews you AT LEAST GIVE IT A TRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only knock on this product is the smell.  It&#x27;s got kind of a caramel smell to it and as a guy I try to steer clear of sweet smelling products.  But once it&#x27;s worked in the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI my hair is dirty blonde, medium length on top (about 2-3 inches long)</li>
    <li> I always look like a million bucks with Woody in my hair. My stylist is jealous that I get such good deals on Amazon</li>
    <li> If you want control with out the shine this is the product for you. Great product. A great alternative and cheaper then American crew Fiber.</li>
    <li> This product is consistently my favorite hair product on the market. It holds hair well but keeps it flexible enough to let your hair move. The best thing, however, is that it&#x27;s easy to wash out as the product is water soluble. The scent is a little different. I like the smell (it smells a little like s&#x27;mores or something). I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My barber introduced me to this product (smaller size, and said something about Fibroin silk) a couple of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is really easy to use; just a TINY dab on your finger, rub your hands together vigorously to spread it out, and lightly apply to your hair in parts.  Isn&#x27;t designed for super hold unless you use more, but it is easy to use, smells decent and is not sticky or hard at all once applied.</li>
    <li> Great product..really handles my wild hair..love it</li>
    <li> Only use this nowadays. The silk fibroin gives my hair that natural shine and it&#x27;s not too sticky. Perfect look every time. The only issue is when you leave the cap open, the product gets oxidized and becomes hard and lumpy. Then it takes more time to brush out or spread the product over my hair. Still a great find. And to think I never knew about it until I opened a Woody&#x27;s pink underwear/shampoo/web combo pack for Christmas a few years ago.</li>
    <li> Does not hold like Woody&#x27;s clay, but then again it serves a different type of style. This is better for longer hair while Woody&#x27;s Clay is better for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It is the one I keep coming back to buy as it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not hesitate to recommend to people.</li>
    <li> Delivered very quickly. No problems at all</li>
    <li> I love this pomade for styling my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or overly sticky like some others I&#x27;ve used.  It has good hold and leaves my hair with a nice dry look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for something different to use on my hair. It&#x27;s thick, wavy and wanted to let it grow out a bit. This stuff is great. Fantastic hold, no shine. PERFECT</li>
    <li> Great texture and hold</li>
    <li> This is fairly stiff, and takes the shine out of my hair, but it also holds it pretty well all day. It&#x27;s for men, but I&#x27;m a lady with short hair. I don&#x27;t like sprays, so this is a nice alternative. My  hairdresser recommended it.</li>
    <li> Works great. i have used this stuff for 3 years now and it does the best.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome. it isn&#x27;t sticky or make your hair feel like cement. i get lasting style all day long, in fact, the longer it is in the better my hair looks. i LOVE all the woodys products, but the web is by far the best.</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps your hair shaped nicely,without being sticky, and smells great</li>
    <li> Smells good--I get compliments--and it works well both on my hair (though you do need to use it when your hair is damp, but not too wet), and keeps the beard in check too. The color becomes invisible when you work in in. Lasts me 4 or 5 months.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift - it is the only kind he&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> My go to hair product for semi-long hair.</li>
    <li> Woody&#x27;s Web provides a great hold without making your hair heavy and greasy.  You don&#x27;t need a lot.  Us this in conjunction with Woody&#x27;s Hair Cream and have the perfect hold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, can&#x27;t beat it!  I&#x27;ve tried others, but nothing comes close to the light control you get with this web that last all day.  Other Woody&#x27;s products are equally as good.</li>
    <li> Great product! lasts a long time. Good hold without the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feel you get from gel. This is a staple for me moving forward.</li>
    <li> I got my hair cut a while back and the girl put some mystery material in my hair, but it made it look materially better.  Next time I went in, I asked her what it was and she showed me the Woody&#x27;s Web tub, so I bought some.  Adds just the right amount of texture to hair; thickens it without making it greasy or shiny looking.  Looks natural, and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get good results.  The tub lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair very soft and pliable but holds nicely. Mind you I have really short hair and really the only draw back is that if you use too much it can make your hair look a little greasy. It was fast shipping and packaged wonderfully. I will buy from again and look forward to trying more products.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite hair product, it held my hair in place the whole with out making my hair gel hard and it had a matte finish with no shine which is great!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a replacement wax product to replace the one I&#x27;ve used for many years but went out of production and the last of my 15 pot buy them all up stock is almost gone.  So I tried woodys and except for the tendency to dry quickly it&#x27;s decent.  Light and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greased!</li>
    <li> This is a good styling product.  I have short hair, and I use this to keep things in order.  It definitely has a shiny quality to it.  I alternate between this product and a matte hair product.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Woody&#x27;s products and Web is one of my favorites. I have thick, straight black hair, and gels tend to give me a shiny and crunchy look. I use Woody&#x27;s Pomade daily, and it gives me a very controlled style without really changing the natural sheen of my hair. I use Web and Clay when I need even more control, like when I&#x27;m sweeping my hair back, or my hair is getting long and I need stronger control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the price, which is outrageous. My barber gets Woody&#x27;s products for me at a barber supply store, so I am avoiding paying retail for the time being. One tub goes a very long way, but if you use it daily as I do, paying $10-$20 per 4 oz can get pricey.</li>
    <li> perfect for medium-length looks, without looking greasy or over-done</li>
    <li> Goes on hair,  great for a pretty good hold.  Smells ok. But makes your face really oily which can lead to break outs.  I now use Paul Michell green tea extract</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever used. I have thick hair that dries out easily, but using a little of this to smooth things out gives my hair a nice clean style. It is (a lot) more than I typically pay, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot each time so it lasts a few months or more.</li>
    <li> Came in so dry useless</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  My stylist suggested it for him, and it is his go to product.  It is a matte finish, so it won&#x27;t make your hair look greasy or wet.  It is thick with a lot of staying power; he has thick wavy hair and this styles it perfectly.  A little goes a long way.</li>
