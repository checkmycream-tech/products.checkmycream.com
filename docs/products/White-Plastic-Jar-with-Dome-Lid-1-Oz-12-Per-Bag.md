    <li> Very fast delivery! just as described. Very happy. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I do like these containers but the ones that came to me were 2 oz, not 1 oz, as advertised. I will use them but I really needed 1 oz containers.</li>
    <li> I like the look and style of these jars, clean and neat.  I use for homemade lotions and balms.  The size is larger than I anticipated, inside volume closer to 1.8 oz when filled to the top.  Great for gifts, samples and travel.  As others have said the twist on top seal is probably not leak-proof for liquids.</li>
    <li> They work great for my essential oil DIY creams and rubs.</li>
    <li> These are great little containers. I bought them to put &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; of my homemade creams and salves. My only complaint was that the containers I received were 2 oz containers, not 1 oz. not really worth complaining about. They&#x27;re good quality, packaged appropriately, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Bought two orders of 1oz jars, and they sent me one order of one oz jars and one order of two oz jars.  The two oz jars were marked as one ounce, but they were most obviously wider and taller than the one oz jars.  Now my Christmas presents will not be shipped in time.</li>
    <li> Very loo quality and those jars are not 1Oz -is 2 Oz!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these jars 3 different times now; yes, they are excellent.  Nice, clean design; good quality; perfect for my purpose.</li>
    <li> Great price! I use it for my home made creams. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The jars were perfect for my hair products. It looks really professional, especially whey you add labeling. It&#x27;s really great!!</li>
    <li> I like these jars.  I got them for homemade creams.  But both packages I received are definitely NOT double-walled, as the description specifies.  They serve the purpose, and they look clean and neat, but I would have really liked the double walled feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Avery 1-1/2 inch circular labels (#8293) fit perfectly on the lid of these jars.</li>
    <li> You see the items you want to purchase and they seem alright, but you really do not know the quality of them until you get them. I thought these jars would be good and be what I needed. They looked pretty enough and the price was beyond reasonable. My amazement when I got them! They were beyond great, pretty, and exactly what I needed! Beyond my expectations! Amazon has hooked me as a customer.</li>
    <li> Thank you! The items look exactly as on the picture!</li>
    <li> These containers are affordable, sturdy, and do what you need them to do.  I use them for cosmetics, creams, soaps, etc, especially for traveling.  They work as expected.</li>
    <li> They leak, move on, don&#x27;t buy these if you are wanting to put liquid in them!  Disaster will ensue!</li>
    <li> These are noticeably larger than the 2 ounce jars I bought from another vendor a few months ago. I will need to see if I can return them without paying shipping. They&#x27;re worthless to me.</li>
    <li> I need more of these!</li>
    <li> Very cute jars! Arrived quickly and in great condition and good quality, just as described. Great for products such as balms, lotions, creams etc. Tight lid, which do not leak. Great product!</li>
    <li> Good jar, but lid was NOT dome! It is round and flat on top. The two don&#x27;t seem to go together!</li>
    <li> They delivered as expected.  I like that they aren&#x27;t cheap-looking, so I&#x27;m okay with the price.  I did have to clean some of them out before using them, but that should be expected with things that go through the mail.  I&#x27;m a happy customer and will order again, if needed.</li>
