      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge and it goes on smoothly like calligraphy art or something..</li>
      <li>The bottle is cute and the product itself is very sufficient to its purpose.</li>

      <li>The liquid eyeliner is jet black beautiful.</li>
      <li>These little eye liners are so cute and very easy to use for liquid eye liner!</li>
      <li>I like this because it drys quick and dosent smudge.</li>
      <li>I ordered this eyeliner mostly because of the cute japanese doll packaging &amp; instead I get a bear shaped one.</li>
      <li>My new favorite.</li>
      <li>love the applicator, and it came early too!</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and to correct mistakes if you have not so steady hands like me.</li>
      <li>Not only does it come in the cutest little package ever, but the make up inside is the best ive ever</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>and I like very much.</li>
      <li>And it looks a little glossy (in a good way).</li>
      <li>next time I ordered more than one.</li>
      <li>I am an avid wearer of eyeliner and I will continue to purchase this when I run out.</li>
      <li>The price is even better than buying the same quality for $8</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely smudgeproof, but I&#x27;m not so sure about waterproof.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Haha!</li>
      <li>but i think it would make people want to talk to me more if i pulled this out to do a touch up on my eyes in a public bathroom or something..very neat</li>
      <li>I love it, not only did the product come sooner than I thought it would</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty shiny finish</li>
      <li>This product&#x27;s black color fits perfectly for my skin tone (I&#x27;m dark skinned) and the packaging came at a very fast pace (which I really like).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful deep black and lasts for all day wear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>This eyeliner draw on nicely but its not really long lasting.  </li>
      <li>This is so so soo precise when I&#x27;m lining my upper lash line.</li>
      <li>and I put some on my hand to test if it was really smudge proof</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very hallucinating the product and</li>
      <li>it for yourself, much cheaper than the crappy ones in stores.</li>
      <li>wow this eyeliner is so nice for such a low price.</li>
      <li>photo is a bit of a through off because I thought it was two but only got one but still a good price for this little object.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and it&#x27;s really easy to control when applying to the lids or under eye.</li>
      <li>I actually like the felt tip better than on more expensive liners out there.</li>
      <li>And if u order more than one they&#x27;ll give you different colors (still black eyeliner on the inside tho)</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it outside yet, but that&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t really felt the need to put on eye liner.</li>
      <li>Not only was the price reasonable but the quality did deliver.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Can flake if not careful</li>
      <li>Either put a picture of only one or make it clear that its only one eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Would make a fun little gift!</li>

<li> Doesnt last long and it smudges</li>
<li> It stays for a very long time.</li>
<li> but the when the 1st one arrived the package was tampered and the liner was dried out, I had to wait two  extra days for the 2nd bottle to arrive.</li>
<li> and i use black eyeliner religiously</li>
<li> It took a little bit longer than anticipated, but once it came in, I instantly tried it out.</li>
<li> Arrived 2 days sooner than expected</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a liquid eyeliner but its not runny like the other eyeliners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product for those questionable customers.</li>
<li> It arrived so late (4-6 weeks?)</li>
<li> but I mean COME ON!</li>
<li> and I rubbed it like crazy</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you get an unopened bottle – I ordered 2</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Thought this was going to be all three eyeliners. Either put a picture of only one or make it clear that its only one eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I just got it and I tested some on my hand and I rubbed it like crazy and it didn&#x27;t come off!!!...love it!!!!..im gona order more for the women in my Family.</li>
    <li> Not but for the price</li>
    <li> This eyeliner draw on nicely but its not really long lasting.  I do have to reapply after a couple of hour but I don&#x27;t know if its because I have oily skin.  I like it cause its cheap!  For the price that you&#x27;re paying, it doesn&#x27;t bother me if I have to reapply again after a couple of hours.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The liquid eyeliner is jet black beautiful. The brush is very precise which helps with creating &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; design. It stays for a very long time. The bottle is cute and the product itself is very sufficient to its purpose. The price is even better than buying the same quality for $8</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s black color fits perfectly for my skin tone (I&#x27;m dark skinned) and the packaging came at a very fast pace (which I really like). And the product itself is very cute. Great quality and meets my requirements.</li>
    <li> my wife loved it she said she deff recommends it to evryone to buy asap!!!! thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;-Los Angeles</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and to correct mistakes if you have not so steady hands like me. It&#x27;s a beautiful deep black and lasts for all day wear.&lt;br /&gt;I love this liquid eyeliner because there&#x27;s no hassle with it at all!&lt;br /&gt;Nice consistency and it doesn&#x27;t run when you apply - also it&#x27;s a good quality eyeliner for an awesome price!&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to remove with makeup wipes at the end of the day without having to struggle like with Wet&amp;Wild&#x27;s liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;Try it for yourself, much cheaper than the crappy ones in stores. Haha!</li>
    <li> This is so so soo precise when I&#x27;m lining my upper lash line. I always wear cateyes since I have monolids, but it&#x27;s my personal preference. It&#x27;s a pretty shiny finish but I don&#x27;t mind. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, especially for the price. It&#x27;s definitely smudgeproof, but I&#x27;m not so sure about waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Precise&lt;br /&gt;Fine tip&lt;br /&gt;Smudgeproof&lt;br /&gt;Longlasting&lt;br /&gt;Pigmented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as others&lt;br /&gt;Tip is a bit rough&lt;br /&gt;Can flake if not careful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof but I didn&#x27;t get it because of that. I got it because it was cute and I like very much. Very very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this eyeliner. Not only does it come in the cutest little package ever, but the make up inside is the best ive ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a liquid eyeliner but its not runny like the other eyeliners I&#x27;ve used. And it looks a little glossy (in a good way). I tell EVERYONE to buy this because its amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the applicator, and it came early too! I think it got here in like 3 days when I chose regular shipping.</li>
    <li> the bottle is cute but not water resistant at all. It arrived so late (4-6 weeks?) that I almost forgot it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eyeliner mostly because of the cute japanese doll packaging &amp; instead I get a bear shaped one. I&#x27;m really disappointed, returning it asap. Havent tried the product &amp; dont want to. Not what was displayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;The seller is resending me what I orginally ordered. So for that, 5 stars. I went ahead and tried the eyeliner they sent by mistake, which they said I could keep and it really is a nice one for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge or crease on my eyelids. It legitimately stays on all day. take it from someone who can&#x27;t go 4 hours with my eyeliner all over my eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> asides from being cute,this eyeliner is great!  extremely easy to apply and lasts all day!! looks amazing!  Im gonna buy a couple in case they run out!</li>
    <li> It took a little bit longer than anticipated, but once it came in, I instantly tried it out. It pretty much felt like a felt tip marker, and since I&#x27;m pretty horrible with eyeliner in general, this really helped me out. I haven&#x27;t worn it outside yet, but that&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t really felt the need to put on eye liner. I feel like I have more control of where I want the line, so that&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> So cute and I put some on my hand to test if it was really smudge proof and it was :) love it! And if u order more than one they&#x27;ll give you different colors (still black eyeliner on the inside tho)</li>

    <li> wow this eyeliner is so nice for such a low price. haha I rhymed : ) It doesn&#x27;t smudge and it goes on smoothly like calligraphy art or something..I feel like an artist whenever I do my eyeliner with this cool thing...the tip of the eyeliner pen has a nice shape and makes it easy to draw on your eyelid...overall I think it&#x27;s a hidden gem as far as eyeliners go...the bottle is cute too and is a fun conversation piece, i dont have many friends but i think it would make people want to talk to me more if i pulled this out to do a touch up on my eyes in a public bathroom or something..very neat</li>
    <li> I am an avid wearer of eyeliner and I will continue to purchase this when I run out. I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> These little eye liners are so cute and very easy to use for liquid eye liner! The brush is pointed, making it way easier to apply. The product last well and doesn&#x27;t start to rub off after applying. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. Not only was the price reasonable but the quality did deliver. It&#x27;s long lasting and it&#x27;s really easy to control when applying to the lids or under eye. I highly recommend this product for those questionable customers. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you get an unopened bottle – I ordered 2 but the when the 1st one arrived the package was tampered and the liner was dried out, I had to wait two  extra days for the 2nd bottle to arrive. But! It was worth it 4out of 5 girls! – love it.</li>
    <li> I like this because it drys quick and dosent smudge. Best of all its so cute! Its instructions are in Japanese but I mean COME ON! Its a liquid eyeliner, figure it out! :D Arrived 2 days sooner than expected and I was very pleased about this! I will feature it in one of my videos!!! Thanks so much! ♥ ♥</li>
