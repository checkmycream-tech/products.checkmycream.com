      <li>Works great.</li>

      <li>Amazing moisturizer!</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>I have had this product before and loved it.</li>
      <li>Received promptly - Have been enjoying using the organic shea butter!  </li>
      <li>this is not as good as the original</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Too many chunks to be called butter</li>
      <li>I like this much better</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>It does melt quickly into my skin once I warm it up</li>
      <li>I love this Shea butter because it doesn&#x27;t have any artificial ingredients in it, smells great, and best of all, prevented stretch marks while I was pregnant.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really good natural moisturizer</li>
      <li>It may feel grainy at first but the warmth of your fingers will melt it smooth.  </li>
      <li>While the product has a pleasant smell (compared to other brands)</li>
      <li>Works well...but the tiny balls it starts out as never quite seem to disappear no matter how warm the lotion becomes.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and hardly any smell which is great for us who cannot tolerate any strong smells.</li>
      <li>It has a light normal odor.</li>
      <li>The only reason for four stars is that it is naturally very oily and it will bleed into nice clothes.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Must completely melt whole jar to get smooth whipped</li>
      <li>First time using pure shea butter</li>
      <li>This is ok, the product is much more gritty than I expected.</li>
      <li>To get around that, I would slather it on all over after my shower and wear clothes I didn&#x27;t care much about, and by morning it was absorbed but my skin was still soft and hydrated!</li>
      <li>You securely every day and also use it to make other natural cream and salves.</li>
      <li>great stuff, gritty and a bit hard to use as opposed to the non-organic version which I used for a long time.</li>
      <li>I am used to it being tough and having to warm it in my hands before putting it on my body, but this one feels like sand and takes even longer to soften.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gross and I can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
      <li>this with other oils such as avocado, apricot, and almond oils to create a fabulous face cream.</li>
      <li>But this one is really grainy and much harder to spread.</li>
      <li>No where near the quality as its non-organic relative.  </li>

<li> Product is grainy, hard to remove from the container unless it&#x27;s heated, and not pleasant application unless it applied in liquid form to the skin post heating it.  </li>

    <li> Excellent!  Organic without the odor of raw shea butter. I like this much better and it works great in my skin care products!</li>
    <li> This is ok, the product is much more gritty than I expected. I have used other products in the past so I was not thinking it would be this gritty. I believe there was some packaging that mentioned it could be this way. It does melt quickly into my skin once I warm it up, however, there are always little grit pieces left over also. I will not buy again. I do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> great stuff, gritty and a bit hard to use as opposed to the non-organic version which I used for a long time. I guess that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;price&amp;#34; you pay for organic.... but I still like it a lot. I mix it with other oils and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Too many chunks to be called butter</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter because it doesn&#x27;t have any artificial ingredients in it, smells great, and best of all, prevented stretch marks while I was pregnant.  Twice!  The only reason for four stars is that it is naturally very oily and it will bleed into nice clothes.  To get around that, I would slather it on all over after my shower and wear clothes I didn&#x27;t care much about, and by morning it was absorbed but my skin was still soft and hydrated!</li>
    <li> Works well...but the tiny balls it starts out as never quite seem to disappear no matter how warm the lotion becomes.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer! First time using pure shea butter and I love it. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Product is grainy, hard to remove from the container unless it&#x27;s heated, and not pleasant application unless it applied in liquid form to the skin post heating it.  No where near the quality as its non-organic relative.  I prefer the organic product but I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;ll order this one again.</li>
    <li> Received promptly - Have been enjoying using the organic shea butter!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this product weeks ago... the delivery was perfect... I like the product btw..</li>
    <li> It may feel grainy at first but the warmth of your fingers will melt it smooth.  I love it.  I use it for my hair, skin, nails and lips!  Has no scent at all.</li>
    <li> I have had this product before and loved it. But this one is really grainy and much harder to spread. I am used to it being tough and having to warm it in my hands before putting it on my body, but this one feels like sand and takes even longer to soften. It&#x27;s gross and I can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
    <li> Good price for quantity ! But wayyyy too grainy even after whipping and heatiing up . Must completely melt whole jar to get smooth whipped product.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to like but can&#x27;t deal</li>
    <li> Too grainy, I couldn&#x27;t get it to work for the lotion I wanted to make with it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as part of my hair regime.  While the product has a pleasant smell (compared to other brands) I concur with the others who wrote about its graininess!  Product is too grainy to melt in ones hands, and therefore creates a  mess all over the place!</li>
    <li> this is not as good as the original</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of shea butter but this is very nice. I use it in homemade lotions and lip gloss. It has a light normal odor. Good quality. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before locally, however the texture for this one was gritty not creamy as it should be.</li>
    <li> I love this product. You securely every day and also use it to make other natural cream and salves. Mix (it makes a great solid base) this with other oils such as avocado, apricot, and almond oils to create a fabulous face cream.</li>
    <li> Works great. Just Not what we needed it for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good natural moisturizer</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and hardly any smell which is great for us who cannot tolerate any strong smells.</li>
