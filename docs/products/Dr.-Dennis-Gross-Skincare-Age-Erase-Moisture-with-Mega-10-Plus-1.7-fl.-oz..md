<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin is super dry and this cream has been a life saver</li>
    <li> This is a lovely lotion that makes my skin look good and feel comfortable. Although I have normal to oily skin, this lotion does not make it greasy. It absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait a long time before putting makeup. At night it does not leave an oily residue on my pillow.</li>
    <li> I am using this in conjunction with the alpha beta daily face peel and I definitely notice a difference in the look and feel of my skin. It doesn&#x27;t transform your skin overnight but after several weeks I can tell it is making a difference--my skin looks brighter and is noticeably firmer and softer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 and just starting my mission to prevent wrinkles and protect my skin.  I started using a serum from Dr. Dennis Gross and liked it, so decided to try this.  I like this - it&#x27;s hydrating but not too greasy.  I do find it *a little* greasier than the typical lotions that I prefer to wear under makeup because within a few hours I can start to feel it.  Still, it feels nice, my skin is very sensitive and I have no reaction.  I like it best at night because my face feels silky soft and happy.  As far as wrinkle prevention, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell; i&#x27;ll update in 5 years or so :)</li>
    <li> I like the product but I think its too expensive not&lt;br /&gt;sure if I will purhase again</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for sensitive skin! It&#x27;s about the only moisturizing cream that doesn&#x27;t break out my face. Love dr. Dennis Gross products.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does what it says and makes my skin feel smooth. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love KInerase Pro Therapy cream because it moisturizes and heals my skin. I am afraid to be without it. But since I turned 51 I have had to add serums etc for moisture. If I understand correctly??-Kinerase is going to be marketed under Obagi soon so I have been looking for something like Kinerase or better. I think I may have found it in Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27; products. It seems to heal my sensitive skin (get occasional adult acne) and moisturize better than Kinerase. And that is saying something cause I&#x27;m a loyal Kinerase Pro Therapy women. Do you have dry, sensitive, winter dehydrated skin? Give it a try!</li>
    <li> this is my first moisturizer i&#x27;ve used (silly i know) but I see no reason to change. I really like how smooth it goes on and soaks in. No issues with makeup directly after.</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Very light. Blends in well. No smell. Overall, great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is a winner all around.  It is minimally scented, absorbs quickly, hydrates and gives the skin a nice glow.  It works so well that you don&#x27;t need to use a primer.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of face creams.  This cream is the best.  It is light weight to wear during the day and also very effective for the P.M.  This cream is gentle on my sensative aging skin.  I have no more dry patches. I love all of the products I have tried from Dr. Gross.</li>
    <li> I had heard about Dr Dennis Gross but had never tried it I was online and amazon had a great price on his moisturizer.  Have used many but this one is incredible.  Texture of my skin is smoother and ive already had people remark about it!! buy this</li>
    <li> Product absorbs wonderfully into skin and skin stays soft.  I love that it has no smell.  This is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This anti-aging moisturizer doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;moisturize\\&quot; my skin.  I have dry skin and feel I have to put another moisturizer on.  Definitely not for people with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I searched high and low for this product when it was discontinued from my local retail store.  When I found it online, I was dissipointed to find a newer version of this product.  It was not as good as the previous formula.  This one seems as little stiff going on and leaves somewhat of a residue.  I am still a fan of their other products, and will keeping buying those.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a little over a year and am very happy with it. I have sensitive skin and many products irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have used Dr. Dennis Gross products for years and I usually ordered from Sephora except this time(stupid me). I always loved their products and this particular moisturizer I have bought so many times. But the first thing I noticed after I received it from this seller was a big nasty chemical smell coming from the cream which NEVER EVER happened with the ones I bought from Sephora. After I used it, my whole face turned tomato red!!!! I had very bad allergic reaction to it. I never had any reaction to this moisturer before. What the F was I thinking? These type of sellers sell cheap only because products are FAKE!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE TOMATO RED FACE!!! I am more than happy to send you my ugly allergic reaction pic if you would like.</li>
    <li> Great !!  My face feels so soft , my occasional breakouts are nonexistent.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Still works really well!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. Apply on a damp face for easy and smooth results.</li>
