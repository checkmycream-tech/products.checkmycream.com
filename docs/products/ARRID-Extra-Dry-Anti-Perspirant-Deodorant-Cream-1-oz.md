<li> it does keep you extra dry.</li>
<li> If other antiperspirants cause breakouts or itching, I recommend that you try this cream.</li>

<li> Even if you bring 3, they still take up less space than a stick.</li>
<li> I usually get with other deodorants.  </li>
<li> Since its a cream, you can rub a little of this into your feet too, for zero &amp;#34;cheesy&amp;#34; smell or to cure athletes foot.</li>

<li> It is a bit messy</li>
<li> And no more itchy underarms.</li>
<li> Since it&#x27;s hard to find it in my area, I decided to buy it from Amazon, and that works for me since I have Amazon Prime.</li>
<li> This arrid deodorant is sometimes hard to find..</li>
<li> I have been using this deodorant for at least 15 years.</li>
<li> It is impossible to get locally.</li>
<li> My husband had a difficult time finding a &amp;#34;non-irritating and effective&amp;#34; deodorant.</li>
<li> our family has used Aarid cream for at least 40 plus years!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great buy. Works well</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this for anyone that likes to travel light and compact. I purchased a 6-pack of them. I keep one in my shave kit for when I travel, and one in my hiking backpack. Much smaller than taking a deodorant stick, roll-on, or spray-can. There is enough in it to last around 10+ days. Even if you bring 3, they still take up less space than a stick. The scent isn&#x27;t my exact favorite but it fades after a few minutes and as the name says... it does keep you extra dry.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, convenient, and reliable</li>
    <li> The only deodorant I can use without smelling in hours, lol. This works very well on me, but I don&#x27;t like how messy it could get - wish they had this same cream, but in a different container that wouldn&#x27;t require the use of hands.</li>
    <li> This arrid deodorant is sometimes hard to find..Delighted to be able to find @ Amazon...fast shipping and great transaction! Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the advised use of this product, but I use it on my hands to help keep them from becoming overly sweaty through the day.  It works well, not perfectly, but better than any non-prescription product and as well as any product I&#x27;ve tried.  Its cheap enough in the bulk pack from amazon that I don&#x27;t worry about breaking the bank just so I can shake a hand.</li>
    <li> love arrid  extra dry have used it for many years</li>
    <li> Always great product from Arrid!</li>
    <li> These will always be reordered as they are used in the family all the time.  They are the best for us and do the job.</li>
    <li> Very good, strong deodorant, that will keep you very dry.  Since its a cream, you can rub a little of this into your feet too, for zero &amp;#34;cheesy&amp;#34; smell or to cure athletes foot.</li>

    <li> Yes...it&#x27;s the only deodorant I used for many years it keeps me very confident from underarm odor and other areas of perspiration!</li>
    <li> excellent product with speedy shipping</li>
    <li> I have always used Arid as it is the only product I know that is effective and does not cause me irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND IT TO MY GRANDDAUGHTERS</li>
    <li> Received with no problem.  Not abundantly available at stores.  Was glad to receive order to have as back up when not in stock at store.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and the product was just what I expected.  If other antiperspirants cause breakouts or itching, I recommend that you try this cream.</li>
    <li> This may sound funny but there have been times I rushed getting dressed for work and forgot my deodorant. This recently happened again (week of February 17, 2014) so I used my old stash that I keep in my personal drawer at work. This stuff never expires; it worked just the same as if it was a new jar! It stops my sweat instantly and BETTER than spray deodorant. I love it and will continually purchase this from Church &amp; Dwight!</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of deodorant that works for me and I am so pleased to be able to get multiple jars at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I like this product - compact - effective - does not get all over my clothes.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and years.  I get upset when I cannot find it in stores so I shop online now.</li>
    <li> Love the cream. work great!</li>
    <li> Since I cannot find this product locally, I have been purchasing it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great. Some may be put-off by having to apply this product with&lt;br /&gt;one&#x27;s fingers. Personally, I prefer a cream deodorant.</li>
    <li> I like this product to help keep my feet nice &amp; fresh. A couple times a week and all is well with the world when my shoes come off! Great product.</li>
    <li> our family has used Aarid cream for at least 40 plus years!!! Glad I can still get this deodorant.  It does NOT stain your clothes and it never fails me!!!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!!!! It reallly works!!!!</li>
    <li> This is what I expected and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> An excellent value for a senior citizen.  Package intact upon arrival and arrival as promised.  Thank you, Amazon!!</li>
    <li> My first introduction to cream deodorant was a container of Tussy on the discontinued rack at my local supermarket.  I liked it, I didn&#x27;t get the itchy underarm feeling I usually get with other deodorants.  Arrid Cream is much  better.  Tussy has more of a paste feel while Arrid has more of a creamy lotion feel.  I put it on after toweling off after my shower or bath and I feel and smell fresh all day and night.  The smell is nice and clean and I stay dry.  And no more itchy underarms.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years now, and I am still in love with it. Definitely must have.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant that I am not allergic to. It is impossible to get locally. I believe it was better priced than locally also.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for at least 15 years. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any perfume, and it really is an antiperspirant. It does not stain your clothes. No other deodorant works for me. Since it&#x27;s hard to find it in my area, I decided to buy it from Amazon, and that works for me since I have Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> thank you thank you thank you!  My mother has been using this since she was a teenager, and this is becoming harder and harder for her to find in stores.  It is wonderful for me to be able to find this on Amazon and send it to her.  She loves this and it is her favorite.  I know my mom has very sensitive skin, and this comes in a jar and is a cream.  Hope that helps</li>
    <li> My husband had a difficult time finding a &amp;#34;non-irritating and effective&amp;#34; deodorant. When he found this one many years ago, he loved it. Recently it&#x27;s been difficult to find this product in local stores, so he is really very pleased to find a good source at a reasonable cost. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Sims</li>
    <li> I did not realize this was even available anymore.  It is a bit messy but I think it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Very happy to find this still available on-line. A great product I have used all my life.</li>
