    <li> Wonderful scent and doesn&#x27;t take too much</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful bath salts!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Zum products, especially Frankincense and Myrrh.  I have used the bath salts, the soap, and the  roll on cologne.  Intense staying power of the fragrances, people often comment on how lovely they are.  I have tried others including Zen Scents which have poor intensity.  I have purchased these for several years and will stay with them for sure.  The lotion is so rich and hydrating, leaves a glow and smells incredible.  Great lotion.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my daughter and she loves the scent</li>
    <li> Am absolutely addicted to this scent.  Love the way it makes my skin feel, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and well worth the price.  I just got out from soaking in it.  It takes so little to make your skin soft and smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this aroma! Makes taking a bath a luxurious pleasure.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but the can size does not last long at all and for the price it&#x27;s a little to pricey for the size you receive.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this scent!  I love all of the Zum Products!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Wife and she loves it. this is the second purchase of this product but there will be many more in the future,</li>

    <li> smells great! wonderful product, I&#x27;ll be buying this over an over again!</li>
    <li> Zum products all seem pretty great - but this is lushly wonderful and a reasonable luxury, too!! The &amp;#34;Dragon&#x27;s Blood&amp;#34; scent is also awesome!</li>
    <li> The smell is completely overpowering.....I had to double bag it in plastic bags just so I could tolerate it in my bathroom. Only use a really small amount in your bath. When you get out, you will feel like a million bucks!</li>
    <li> I used to get this at the grocery store. Now it&#x27;s only available online. Good Stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a Must-Have for me from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in a bath the other day and was just bubbling with joy :) The container is a little smaller than I was expecting, but I didn&#x27;t have to use much and it is SOOOO luxurious and wonderful. I think I&#x27;m going to try their Eucalyptus one next :)</li>

    <li> Good product but too expensive.  About $2.00 a bath.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I am ordering more.  I love your use of essential oils!!</li>
    <li> Does the job soothing and the smell is wonderful.  Softens the skin a little goes a long way will buy again</li>
