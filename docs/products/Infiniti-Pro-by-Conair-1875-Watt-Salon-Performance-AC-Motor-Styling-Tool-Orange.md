<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this dryer is a lifesaver and timesaver. It really does cut drying time in half and I find that it gives me less frizz than other, cheaper dryers. The good thing about this dryer is that the price is pretty great for what it can do, and you&#x27;re not spending hundreds of dollars on a high-end dryer. Its a tad on the heavy side, but since I&#x27;m not using it every single day, it&#x27;s just perfect for when I need it and don&#x27;t mind my hand hurting a little bit. Buy this dryer- you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> After using the Conair 259 Infiniti Pro, 1875 [Salon Performance Ac motor styling Tool in orange] I&#x27;d say job well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all the bells &amp; whistles and fancy name, It does what a hair dryer should do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...dry-your-hair-quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long and thick. With most hair dryers it takes me between 10-15 minutes to dry my hair depending on how much I&#x27;ve let it air dry first. This hair dryer took me 8. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s about 2 minutes faster than the average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never personally believed in any \\&quot;ion\\&quot; special powers or ability for a hair dryer to make your hair shiny, but I will say that it&#x27;s easy to hold [light &amp; easy to grip] &amp; works like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it salon quality? At under $30, it&#x27;s a great deal, but I don&#x27;t think it completely compares to a $100 hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on Hot &amp; High and was impressed at it&#x27;s ability to get me dry fast. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for in a hair dryer, this orange one&#x27;s for you.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it got such great reviews, and I noticed it while I was searching for something else in the Amazon beauty section.  So glad I bought it!  Love the strong wind of this dryer.  Love that it cuts down on my drying time.  (I have very thick hair.)  Even love this dryer WAAAAAY more than the one for which I paid $200.  (Wish I&#x27;d seen this one first!)  Amazing.  The only problem is what do I do with the expensive dryer?!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten Conair hairdryers in the past and been pretty pleased with them. With this Conair hairdryer, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It&#x27;s powerful and dries my hair quickly, which makes me happy because I dislike hairdryers that take forever to dry hair. It&#x27;s got warm and hot heat settings which is nice because some people like to have more heat than others. It&#x27;s also got a low and high setting which is also nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complaint is that it is a little on the heavy side and can be hard to hold up but that&#x27;s not to big of a problem. I would have no problem recommended this hairdryer to anyone. Two thumbs up for me!</li>
    <li> Dries hair super fast but wow, is this thing loud. It sounds like a tank starting up, even on the low setting. However, it still ranks better than the other four I tried and returned - dries hair quickly, not too heavy, and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed in this hair dryer. I really wanted to like it, but it&#x27;s just not for me. It is powerful but a little heavy. The main reason I don&#x27;t like it is because my hair was lifeless after using this dryer. Even my hair color seemed flat and dull. It&#x27;s weird that a hair dryer could do that. Maybe it has something to do with the ions. Anyway, we will keep it because my husband is using it to warm the bed on cold winter nights, but I won&#x27;t be using it on my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer puts out a lot of air - very forceful. I have a lot of hair and it usually takes forever to dry. With every other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had, including the ones at the salon, it takes 20-30 minutes to dry my hair, after towel drying. With this one, it takes only 5. Gives lots of body too! I would pay 3-4 times as much for this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have black shoulder length, thin, wavy managable hair. I am of Indian origin.  The dryer works well for me, i would definitely recommend it. It dries my hair in less than 5 mins, on low setting. I have never used a very expensive dryer- so dont know the differences.   The weight is good.  Heat setting works great for my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought a Revlon RV544 to replace an old, old hair dryer I&#x27;d had that just wasn&#x27;t doing the job any more. The Revlon was junk, so after a week, I ordered this one (the Conair Pro) and when I received it I threw the Revlon away. This one seems to be built a lot better, and since the first Revlon I bought didn&#x27;t work at all and had to be exchanged, and the second one I bought never worked properly, this one, working exactly as it should, works SO much better. It is on the heavier side, but it&#x27;s seems well-built and it&#x27;s effective. It dries quickly (I have THICK hair) and my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy and doesn&#x27;t look dry or damaged, despite blow drying and straightening every day. If it lasts, I&#x27;ll be thrilled with this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quiet and it moves a lot of air.  Plenty of power.  The \\&quot;medium\\&quot; setting for heat and the fan out perform other dryers set at \\&quot;high\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this dryer on a whim after seeing it in a youtube video. The day after I watched the video my Conair Yellowbird dryers heating component went out, so I made a quick run to Walmart and saw the same dryer. I knew I wanted something with an AC motor, and saw that this one had an AC motor so I went for it.    I am SO glad that I got it! I loved my Yellowbird dryer because it got hot and had a very powerful high setting. The infiniti blew this dryer out of the water. The Yellowbird, although I liked that it got hot, got too hot and would burn my hair/brushes/surrounding objects. The Infiniti has just the right amount of heat where I can style my 95% dry hair with a ceramic brush, without destroying things with the heat. And the power is out of this world! I noticed that when I was trying to style my hair on the medium setting that it was not enough power for my preferences, but the high setting was perfect. I also really like the cold setting, which I used on my hair after I was done styling. The cold shot button is significantly colder, which is nice if you want to get something cold fast. I was able to finish drying and styling my hair 15-20min quicker than I normally would, which is definitely a bonus. My hair also came out very soft, sleek, and I had no flyaways. I am notorious for getting the pieces of hair that stand straight up on my crown, but didn&#x27;t have any after using this dryer! Another thing that saved me time was that I always use a straightener to go over parts of my hair after blow drying. With this dryer I didn&#x27;t even have to turn on my straightener. It came out perfect!    There were two things about this dryer that I did not particularly like. One was that the hair dryer tangled my hair quite a bit, but I was able to fix that with a quick brushing. Another thing, and I am not entirely sure if this is a hair dryer problem or something to do with my electricity, but the hair dryer kept shooting out a blue light from the nozzle. What? Ihave never seen something like this before and my old dryer definitely did not do this. Regardless of the light it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing any damage and I am hoping that the dryer is not broken.    Overall though I would still give a 5 star because it is amazing for the price. This is my favorite dryer, ever.</li>
    <li> Not only is the color of this blow dryer appealing, but the overall design of it looks high end.  Some people say that this blow dryer is heavy... I beg to differ.  The one I&#x27;ve been using for the past 15 years is MUCH heavier. This thing feels like a feather compared to my old one.  I was able to cut my drying time in half, and I can&#x27;t believe how much healthier my hair felt after using this compared to my old one.  I ran out of the bathroom yelling at my dad to feel my hair because it was so soft!  It also gave me incredible (in a good way!) volume! Like just the PERFECT amount!  The price for this is perfect... honestly, for what you get, I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d be closer to that 100$ value it says it&#x27;s worth.  I will DEFINITELY be buying another one of these in the future so I have a backup if this one ever breaks.  I read where some people have mentioned that the &#x27;cool&#x27; setting is still warm...  mine isn&#x27;t?  It comes out perfectly cool.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs or, just wants, a new one. :)</li>
    <li> I first used this hair dryer at a local gym and could not believe the difference in my hair.  My husband bought me one for Christmas and I cannot even begin to tell you how different my hair is.  It does not dry my hair out and makes it so silky and soft.  I cannot believe that the damage to my hair previously was from my other hair dryer.  It is amazing the difference and my hair is no longer frizzy or damaged.  I have been spending a ton of money on products and now with this dryer know it was the dryer that was the problem.  The price on Amazon is much cheaper than other places so this is really a terrific buy.  You will not believe your hair, and watch the video for styling tips.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> This is the worst dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  First, it does not get hot enough.  The high heat setting is more like a medium or low heat setting on other dryers.  Second, even in low speed setting the dryer just blows my hair around like crazy and I have no styling control - even with either of the concentrator nozzles.  I have a lot of very fine hair and while this dryer dries it extremely fast, I cannot even begin to style my hair with a round brush during drying.  Third the toggle switches are poorly placed so I frequently accidentally change the heat/speed setting while I am drying my hair.  And finally, it is heavier than most dryers, which might have been acceptable if it did an adequate job drying/styling my hair.  I am sending this dryer back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to researching nearly every item I buy these days.  I have been using this hair dryer for about a year now and have been nothing short of pleased!  I would say that the only flaw, which was expected, is that it&#x27;s a bit heavier than my last dryer.  However, I don&#x27;t regret the purchase and am happy I discovered this one.</li>
    <li> this drier looks very cool, beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;it help me dry my hair easily, levels wind speed, levels temperature, good quality. not that cheap stuff can compare with.</li>
    <li> As many others have stated, this dryer is heavy and puts out a lot of air. I thought the power would be a positive trait, but in fact the dryer puts out so much air that you have little control as you use it. My long hair was blown about so much that it got tangled and ended up looking like brittle straw. I decided to give the dryer another try, this time using the diffuser. Same result, only this time it took forever to get my hair dry, still looking like tangled straw. I just put it back in the box for a swift return.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer because I wanted something inexpensive and reliable.  After seeing a lot of good reviews, I bought it.  I was extremely disappointed.    First, I have medium to thick hair.  It&#x27;s naturally wavy and I normally like to wear it straight, so I&#x27;ll dry it and then run a flat iron through it every couple days.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for years and I&#x27;ve tried many different dryers in the past, so I know what works for my hair.  This dryer leaves my hair feeling so weighed down.  There is no life to it all.  It almost looks greasy after half a day.  I even gave it a few more tries, thinking it was just a fluke.  Definitely not!    Also, I know someone mentioned this dryer is light weight and quiet.  Think again.  Like I said, I&#x27;ve tried many different dryers in this price range and this was very loud and HEAVY!    Maybe, it works for other hair types but this dryer left my naturally thick, voluminous hair dull, weighed down and greasy.</li>
    <li> I was expecting an average ho-hum dryer when I got it. After all, a hair dryer is a hair dryer, right? I was pleasantly surprised. The weight is substantial without being heavy. It feels solid and sturdy. The color is a metalic orange. Very modern and attractive. As for the drying ability, it was much better than my old Conair hair dryer. Althought it has the same number of watts, it seems to dry my hair faster and with less static afterwards. I also love the lint cap at the opposite end of the dryer. It comes off easily for cleaning. Very nice dryer.</li>
    <li> The ConAir InfinitPro is a bright orange hairdryer that is touted as a salon-quality styling tool. It has a number of good features and is a good dryer but it does have a couple of minor quirks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the shape of the handle is gently curved and fits nicely in the hand. The controls on the handle are on the front side and are surprisingly out of the way. I was initially concerned that users would have a problem with inadvertently hitting one of the switches, but this does not appear to be the case at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two speed settings and three temperature settings which make finding the right adjustment simple. At least one other reviewer claimed that the cool temperature setting is still too warm, but I disagree - the cool setting just moves air (though after using the hair dryer for a period of time on the warm or hot settings may result in the cool setting moving cool air over warm coils, which would result in warmer air).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting feature is the Cold button, which when used causes the dryer to blow cool air regardless of the setting. This is a handy feature for \\&quot;fine tuning\\&quot;, but there is a quirk in the implementation. If the dryer is set to the low speed setting, and the cold button is pressed while the temperature is set to either warm or hot, the motor speeds up. Perhaps this is to clear out any hot air on the coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fairly heavy hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included with the dryer is a pair of concentrator attachments. These simply snap into place and pop off with gentle pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good hair dryer that is solidly constructed and has a nice feature set. With proper care it should last for years and serve the user well.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a good-quality hair dryer.  It&#x27;s highest settings are powerful and hot for fast drying and the cold shot is definitely cold.  I have thick medium-length wavy hair, so sometimes I blow dry it straight, and it is prone to a little frizz.  I would say that the ionic technology may help reduce frizz some, but it would be hard to say for sure without being scientific about it and drying half my head with this dryer and the other half with my old dryer.  I can say the results are not that dramatic in my case.  I do like the snazzy color.    My main complaint about this dryer is the placement of the switches - they are rocker switches so when holding it by the handle and drying my hair, I often change the settings by mistake.  I try to hold it in such a way that my fingers don&#x27;t touch the switches, but it&#x27;s a bit of a pain.  Also, the description claims the dryer is quiet and it&#x27;s not - it&#x27;s as loud as most any other dryer.  I personally haven&#x27;t noticed it being too heavy as some reviewers mentioned.</li>
    <li> Those of us with short hair usually allow our hair to dry the natural way, but hair dryers are sometimes needed and this Conair hair dryer is a very good one for the price. It offers a powerful 1875 watt motor with two speeds and three heat settings for the best drying and styling possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, my hair is very short and I don&#x27;t usually use hair dryers. So, to really put this hair dryer to the test, I had my wife try it out and report the results back to me. She agreed that the motor is very powerful and the heat very intense. The cold shot button is also quite useful, but what she liked best of all is the ionic feature. This special feature utilizes ion technology to help prevent frizz and I was told that it does make a noticeable difference. It isn&#x27;t perfect at eliminating frizz, but it is certainly better than other hair dryers that do not have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair 249 Infiniti Pro is a little heavier than other hair dryers I have owned/used, but with this added weight comes added durability. This hair dryer is built tough and built to last. I haven&#x27;t owned it for long, but it has a certain feel to it that indicates it is more durable than the average hair dryer. Further proof of this is the four- year manufacturer&#x27;s warranty. How many hair dryers nowadays come with a four year warranty?- Not many, and this is proof of the manufacturer&#x27;s confidence in its product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair includes two attachments with this hair dryer: A concentrator and a diffuser, and these can both prove very useful for styling. My hair is short so I don&#x27;t have any practical need, but I can see how these attachments could benefit others and the ladies in my household have confirmed that these attachments are useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair drying isn&#x27;t very important to those of us with short and/or thin hair, but it matters to those with longer hair and the Conair 249 Infiniti Pro is a very good hair dryer for the serious stylist. The ionic feature, the multiple settings, the cold shot button, etc., are very useful and when you factor in the durability and the relatively low price, you have a hair dryer that earns an easy recommendation.iple settings, the cold shot button, etc., are very useful and when you factor in the durability and the relatively low price, you have a hair dryer that earns an easy recommendation.</li>
    <li> I like the power but it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  I went back to my old Conair hair dryer :(</li>
    <li> What an awesome hairdryer! This item was number one on my Christmas list this year as I had recently blown out my last hairdryer (it was a Conair also) after almost 5 years. I did extensive research including visits to a local beauty supply store to see how each dryer felt in  my hands, their weight, heat options, ect. I was satisfied with the Conair 259 Infiniti Pro AC (and loved that it wasn&#x27;t black or silver!) so it was the one I decided to request. I used it promptly Christmas  morning and continued to be impressed. It added volume, dried my hair very quickly, and my husband, who was only just right downstairs, even said he could not even hear that I was blow drying my hair. It is so quiet! The dryer is very sleek looking and is surprisingly small. It comes with two attachments, neither of which I have utilized yet. The plug does have a reset and a test button, which are always important to me. The cord comes with a sort of plastic tie attached to it. It can be cut off but I find it very useful for keeping the cord bundled together with the dryer when it is  being stored with other electronics in the bathroom closet. Just a small addition that I have found useful.     I would absolutely recommend this product to others. I blow dry my hair every morning so it is very important to me to have a well working styling tool. Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> I know this sounds weird, but this was actually an impulse item.  I saw it featured in a store and it looked cool, so I took a chance and bought it.  It turned out to be a great purchase!  The Conair 259 Infiniti Pro is very lightweight, not too large (definitely smaller and lighter than my Vidal Sassoon dryer).  I love the 3 speeds, especially the cool speed.  And it&#x27;s powerful!  Wow.  The airflow is really strong and will dry your hair fast.  All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Let me first state that I do like this product for straightening hair. If you have straight hair and want a straight dyer, this is a great one and I recommend it. However, if you have curly hair and want a curly look, you may want to look elsewhere. The product description states that this dryer comes with a diffuser attachment. IT DOES NOT HAVE A DIFFUSER ATTACHMENT! Instead, there are two concentrator attachments. I emailed the company to see if there is a diffuser attachment that fits this dryer but haven&#x27;t heard back yet. If I can&#x27;t get a diffuser, I plan to return it because trying to use this dryer for a curly look results in major frizz. The dryer blows to hard to keep curls in their shape. (If anyone has curly hair and uses this dryer successfully, I would love any tips/suggestions!)</li>
    <li> I was going to buy the Conair 213XP but was concerned about the reviews pertaining to its weight, as I have some arthritis. Then I saw this dryer. It only had 3 reviews but they were all excellent ones. Since my previous dryer had died that morning, I checked to see if any stores sold it and found it at Target. Well, I am so pleased with this purchase. It works just as well (maybe better) as the $100+ one I had a few years back that died after only 6 months. My hair is fine, and with other dryers, the warm setting is usually not warm enough and the hot setting feels like its frying it. This dryer has hot, warm, and cool settings, which are actually hot, warm, and cool. The airflow has 2 speeds, with both speeds being useful. The higher flow really puts out the air. and the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; shot is amazing. It actually gets \\&quot;cool\\&quot; within about 2 seconds. None of my other dryers have ever gotten that cool. After I&#x27;m finished drying my whole hair, I also use the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; shot to completely cool it off. My hair looks and feels soft and shiny, and I&#x27;m almost 60 years old. As far as the noise, it has the same sound as the dryer my hairstylist uses. I will definitely buy this dryer again when this one goes.</li>
    <li> I have been using another Conair ceramic dryer for about a year, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting a massive improvement with this new model, but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression was I was impressed at how much lighter this \\&quot;Conair 259 Infiniti Pro\\&quot; is.  I have seen a few reviews calling this \\&quot;heavy,\\&quot; but my experience is just the opposite.  Compared to my old tank of a Conair dryer, this Infiniti Pro is light and fluffy.  A definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;Infiiti Pro\\&quot; features all the hair dryer buzz words.  The ceramic helps with even heat-distribution, and the tourmaline, a semi-precious gemstone, is one of the world&#x27;s best ionic and infrared generators.  The tourmaline combined with ionic technology, according to the hype, showers your hair with negative ions, which allow water to penetrate deeper into your hair which then re-hydrates and reconditions your hair, also cutting drying time in about half.  Science says this is a load of marketing blather (water being already ionic, so adding more ions accomplishes nothing), but does admit that ionic technology leaves hair looking shinier for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientific or not, my drying time was definitely lowered with this \\&quot;Infinit Pro,\\&quot; so there must be something to the technology.  All of the other gadgets were pretty standard issue, like the cold shot button and the various heat/strength settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is lighter and more manageable than my previous Conair ceramic, the \\&quot;Infiniti Pro\\&quot; is still bulky and hard to handle if you are smaller.  All that fancy technology takes up space, apparently, and there isn&#x27;t much you can do about that.  Also, there are no \\&quot;travel features\\&quot; on this hair dryer.  No collapsible handle. No retractable cord.  This is great for a stay-at-home dryer but don&#x27;t expect to take it with you when you go on a trip.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big, orange and ready to do some major drying.  While this dryer is larger than what I&#x27;m used to, it is about average in size compared to most.  But more importantly, it&#x27;s light.  I was rather impressed by this Conair model.    The settings for this model are very well tempered.  On hot, it is actually hot.  I tend to keep it on warm and while I usually don&#x27;t use the cold setting I will say that it does get pretty cool/cold, especially with the cool shot, which really is a quick cooling feature.  As you can tell, I&#x27;m not a hairstylist, but this dryer definitely gets the job done.  The hair dryer has been in use for a few weeks now and is performing very well.  Even though it&#x27;s lightweight, it seems to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer!  It&#x27;s inexpensive, yet works just as well as salon dyers.  It has several settings and the high really does get my hair dry quickly!  I&#x27;d never owned a ceramic or ionic hairdryer before, and I believe that this dryer does make my hair look smoother.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  It is really powerful and dries hair quickly.  The temperature and speed is also adjustable, which is really good for styling different sections of your hair.  I use this product almost every day and I think it is great.</li>
    <li> This Conair Infiniti Pro replaced my 5-year-old Conair dryer, and I am incredibly impressed.  I thought this one would be a bit more stylish, maybe smaller and lighter weight (true, true, and true), but I thought that they would perform about the same.  I was wrong.  This Infiniti Pro is remarkably powerful.  It&#x27;s \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting is about the same as the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting on my old one, and it is even a little quieter.  Its \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting is very strong, and I can dry my wiggling two-year-old&#x27;s long hair in record time.    If this were any smaller, it could be considered travel-size.  There&#x27;s really nothing that I dislike about this product.  I dry my hair seven days a week, and I often dry my daughter&#x27;s hair, as well.  This dryer has gotten daily use for nearly one week, and I can&#x27;t think of a single criticism.  I think this one will be with me for years.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! First of all, the color is great. It is not too heavy, despite what other reviewers have said. Look up any hair dryer on here and all are within a few ounces of each other. I have very long, thick hair and this dries it very quickly. It also makes my hair look so smooth, whereas my old hair dryer made my hair fluffy, this one keeps it smooth and sleek. Great hair dryer; so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> I researced this product for quite some time, then finally decided to buy. At first I used it for about a month and then I thought there wasnt much diffrence between this and my old dryer except less fly-aways.  So one day I decided to use my old dryer instead...WOW...IT WAS A DIFFRENCE.     It dries my hair more quickly and it doesnt give it that \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; look(I have long, thick, straight hair). Guess it was hard to realize this because over the period of a month my thinned-out layered hair started to become thick again.     I WOULD RECOMMEND this dryer.  It is heavier than my old one, but I only use it to dry my hair...not do a blow-out.    And to those who said it doesnt get as hot as other blow dryers...I would have to disagree. I have very thick hair and there were a couple of times the heat got through to my scalp(due to the strong air flow it has) and I had to pull the dryer back...ouch!</li>
    <li> I really find this dryer hard to work with.  On the lowest and medium settings, there&#x27;s not enough air.  On the highest setting, it&#x27;s like hurricane-force wind.  It&#x27;s very difficult to style when the directional attachment is on, and the diffuser doesn&#x27;t seem to do much--it&#x27;s so big and clunky.  Overall, really disappointed with the performance of this dryer.  LOVE the orange color, though.</li>
    <li> I have long curly thick hair and this blow dryer works phenomenally! Cut my dry time in half. Also I&#x27;m not one to leave reviews but this one I had to. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My wife was hounding me to get her a better hairdryer, and with all of the \\&quot;professional\\&quot; models out there it was difficult to make a decision. She was upgrading from a crappy cheap appliance, so frankly anything would have been sufficient... but she really likes this hairdryer and the features it provides. She has also mentioned that the time it takes her to dry her hair has decreased significantly.     For the price, if you&#x27;re just upgrading from a crap hairdryer, buy this one with confidence. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because of the 1875 power force and wanted to have this particular model because of the amazingly bold color. After read the other reviews, I felt confident that this would be a good bet.  But nothing prepared me for when I got it and used the dryer for the first time.  Literally, I was blown away!  The wind power is so great...like the fans used in a movie.  I held my dryer at my waist, facing upward ,and my hair moved as if there was a powerful fan blowing my hair in a \\&quot;windstorm.\\&quot;  The dryer is rather heavy which lends to an impression of sturdiness and seems like a solid investment thus far.  Very pleased with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> After using this three times, I am going to return it.  I was using another brand with a diffuser to work with my natural curl and was always happy with the results.  The Infiniti has a more powerful \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting, but even with the diffuser, it blows the hair around a bit too much.  It is also very loud.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It has 3 speeds and the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting is very strong! I have thick hair and enjoy using the medium heat and high blower setting to blow dry my hair quickly without sweating all my makeup off. It&#x27;s also not as loud as my old Conair cord-keeper dryer which wasn&#x27;t nearly as strong.</li>
    <li> Not only is this dryer a beautiful color it is also very powerful. It dries my long thick hair in record time. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous hair dryers over the years. I&#x27;ve paid anywhere from $20 to $200. I purchased it because of the reviews and being low on money at the time my old hair dryer bit the dust. I was a bit leery because of the low price. You get what you pay for, right? Well, not in this case. This is by far the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. Dries my hair fast without the frizz! I have recommended this hair dryer to ALL my friends and family!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works great...hair dries quickly and the styling adapters do the magic.  I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone that wants a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; outcome.</li>
    <li> I have another Conair hair drier that I bought a couple of years ago, and this one blows that one out of the water--pun intended!  The airflow is better directed, so I can aim it exactly where I want it, and this one takes half the time to dry my hair, even though they both use 1875 Watts.  The ceramic heating element and ionizer effectively minimize fly-away hair, and the combination of the two works much better than one with just an ionizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the controls are easy to reach without being in the way (I often accidentally switched the heat setting on my old one).  As with most driers these days, this one has three heat settings plus a cold blast button and two speeds, high and low.  It comes with two air \\&quot;concentrators\\&quot; as well as a few directions on how to style hair.  Although this Conair is somewhat heavy and large, it&#x27;s not as bulky as other large driers, another bonus.  I keep my hair drier in a drawer, and my selection is often limited by what can fit inside since so many have bulbous housings.  At 3 5/8 inches at its widest, this one just clears the drawer.  It has a removable filter to clean out the lint that accumulates over time and which can decrease the life of a hair drier.  The power cord is 6 feet long; unlike other models, this one does not have a retractable cord, something I don&#x27;t care about but others may, given how long the cord is. This drier does not have a switch to convert to the greater European voltage standard.  Americans who take their hair driers abroad will still have to use a converter and adapter sequence to use it.  Because this isn&#x27;t intended to be a portable appliance, this last omission should affect few people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I&#x27; could get this excited about a hair drier, but I really love it.  I just hope it lasts a long time, as the company claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my dryer a few times now, and I LOVE IT! Typically I wash my hair, put it in magnetic rollers, slide a [[ASIN:B000YC3VHS Jet Bonnet Dryer Attachment]] over my roller set, and sit down to play Sims 3 or watch a DVD for an hour, since that&#x27;s, on average, how long it takes my hair to dry on the bonnet&#x27;s required low dryer setting. Amazingly enough, with THIS dryer, what has always taken 60 minutes with my other Conair dryer, now only takes me 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that my hair feels much silkier and smoother, and has much more body with this new dryer than it does with my old Conair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself is an attractive copper orange color, and is comfortable in the hand. The ergonomics of the handle guide your fingers to the rocker and cool shot buttons, making it super easy to make temperature adjustments during drying jobs. It&#x27;s a solidly made, heavy duty dryer, without feeling too heavy in the hand. I would expect longer drying jobs to be perfectly manageable, but with the temperature settings, and their wonderful accuracy, I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone would find themselves having to use this dryer very long at all to do the job (my stylists have always told me that I have fine hair, but I have MASS quantities of it, so if it dries mine quickly, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do the same for you)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of temperature, I was amazed at how truly accurate this dryer is with regards to temperature! Hot is actually, truly hot (while not being uncomfortably so), warm is where it should be, and the cool setting and cold shot button put air out that&#x27;s as cool as what you&#x27;ll get from your air conditioner! It&#x27;s really quite amazing (I might put those buttons to use next time we have another unbearably hot summer)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the air filter has a removable cover - important for anyone to maintain their dryer, but especially so for me in my pet hair-laden home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser attachments (not just one, but two) are great for channeling the air exactly where you want it to go. There&#x27;s one that has vents on the sides and a slightly more rounded channel/mouth, and one that&#x27;s got a more tapered, narrower opening with no vents, for direct air flow to the targeted area. I can see the vented diffuser being great for brush-drying your hair without exposing it to more air than you want, and the non-vented diffuser is great for drying your hair after a good workout, or just for a quick root-smoothing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really very happy with this dryer, overall, and have no cons to offer with regards to it. I&#x27;m confident that this dryer is good enough to rival my stylists&#x27; dryers, yet the cost is low enough to make it great to have at home. Overall, two thumbs up!u want it to go.

    <li> I bought this hair dryer after using my sister&#x27;s when I visited her for a week. When I returned home, my hair dryer did not stack up at all and I couldn&#x27;t stand how little power it seemed to have. By comparison, the Conair one is up there with salon hair dryers. It has enough settings to accommodate different levels and temperatures, but the highest heat and the strongest setting doesn&#x27;t make your head feel like it&#x27;s being cooked and yet dries your hair in only a couple minutes (and my hair is shoulder length). After several months, it&#x27;s still going strong and shows no signs of wear and tear, even after daily use.</li>
    <li> I placed an order because the product description said both diffuser and concentrator attachment.But it came with two concentrator attachments..so I ordered a replacement and amazon sent two more(no clue why) of the same dryer and neither had the diffuser!! I was left with 3 dryers and none of them had what I was looking for!   Needless to say I spent a good amount of time on customer service and they offered to send me Conair 213xp. Keeping my fingers crossed now. If you are looking for both diffuser and concentrator , do not get this.    This is the fist time amazon has messed up an order and I was quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> I can actually say that I only have had this for 2 months and I can truthfully say that I&#x27;m done drying my hair in exactly 15 minutes!! I have thick waist long hair. It usually took me about 30 minutes to dry my hair plus I would have to iron my hair.. Now only in 15 minutes I get totally dried hair plus I am learning a new technique to make more volume to my hair before I curl and I extremly love this!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer because it was advertised as light and quiet.  It is neither, not even remotely, not even close.  It *is* exceptionally well balanced and powerful, which helps mitigate the weight issue, but I am not sure how Conair&#x27;s marketing team sleeps at night.  Seriously.    Also, one of the advantages is an AC motor?  When&#x27;s the last time you used a hairdryer with a DC motor that requires batteries?  I guess it is lightweight compared to that....</li>
    <li> This is a good buy for $30. While it&#x27;s still not quite as good as a salon quality hair dryer, for $30 it&#x27;s worth it. It is advertised as being lighter when in fact it is heavier than any hair dryer i&#x27;ve ever held but since i figure i need the exercise any way this doesn&#x27;t bother me. The highest speed setting is great for drying but probably a little too strong for styling (the lower setting works just fine for styling). A great range of heat settings. Overall a good hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Powerful, durable, not extremely heavy, create lots of volume and shine for your hair.  The cool, warm, hot settings are very useful.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer today because my old one went kaput on me. And I have nothing but great things to say about this hair dryer! My hair stylist told me to buy a nicer hair dryer and I&#x27;d be able to tell a difference. And while this dryer is not $100, she said to spend at least $30, which I did. It has the power of a salon style dryer but probably a third of the price. I didn&#x27;t notice that it was heavier than usual so I wouldn&#x27;t fret too much about the weight. I also love where the buttons are placed. I prefer the front vs. the sides. 3 heat settings, a cool button, and 2 power levels, this hair dryer has it all. Plus I love the cool orange color. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the good reviews.  They were correct.  It has plenty of heat and power.  the only bad thing is the color - it is really orange.  but hey I don&#x27;t have to wear it, so who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2013&lt;br /&gt;Still working great.  No regrets.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for.  There were 3 things that were appealing to me: Ion technology, AC motor (my current dryer is DC), and design.  I love how shiny / smooth my hair looks after using it.  The noise level is a bit subjective (depending on what you&#x27;re comparing this dryer to), but it&#x27;s relatively quiet compared to my OLD dryer.    The only con about this hair dryer is the awkwardness of the placement of the buttons - I find that when I&#x27;m holding the handle, they can be easily switched / touched.  It&#x27;s not too big of a deal though, and overall I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Has a lot of power and heat - cool shot button is cool. A little hard to switch the toggle switches without looking, but this should become easier with practice.</li>
    <li> This dryer is so gorgeous, I love the color. But aside from that it so much more powerful than the old Conair dryer I&#x27;ve been using the past 20 years or so (yeah I waited that long to replace my dryer), cutting my drying time in half or better. I never realized that the new technology could make my hair come out nicer and less frizzy! I love this dryer. And it has better features than my old dryer as well such as 3 temps to choose from and the cold blast. I hightly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I really love this dryer, though I have to agree with others, it IS heavy. However, since it seems to dry my hair more quickly and efficiently than others, I am holding it for less time so I guess it balances out.  Another thing I like; some other dryers are engineered so that as I&#x27;m holding them, I inadvertantly turn them off as I grip the handle. Not so with this one; I haven&#x27;t turned it off once since I&#x27;ve had it. I&#x27;ve always liked Conair products and am glad I chose this dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I know Conair is a quality company, the sleek look and stylish color, and I&#x27;m a sucker for the word Pro in the name ... there, I said it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can absolutely say this is an great hair dryer.  My hair dries quickly, the dryer doesn&#x27;t overheat, and it is simple on my hands ergonomically.  What I can&#x27;t say; however, is that this is a styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me to qualify this as a styling tool it would need much better attachments than what was included in the box.  I have very full, thick hair and the tapered nozzle attachment is much too small to be of any use whatsoever.  Thus, if you are looking for a styling tool, you might want to pass on this product - but if you want a great hair dryer - I would recommend the Conair Infiniti Pro.</li>
    <li> I was scared when I ordered this due to the reviews of it being super heavy and loud, well I got mine in the mail and used it right away, mine came with a free diffuser for curly/wavy hair which was nice. it isnt that loud even on high to me, it dosent get THAT hot when on high but thats totally okay with me I dont wanna fry my hair, it still works great and straightens my hair makes it smooth and frizz free so I dont have to flat iron after using, I also use this to dry and smooth my clip in hair extensions after I wash or dye them. Love this hairdryer I use it about once a week so it should last me awhile.</li>
    <li> This gets my hair dry much quicker than my previous dryer. I&#x27;ve been attached to the same model of hair dryer for almost 10 years, unable to find a dryer that had power and didn&#x27;t fry my hair. This is it! As far as the \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; advertisement... It&#x27;s certainly quieter than some but it&#x27;s still a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a great little hairdryer.  Really gives my hair the lift it needs.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments on how good my hair now looks and it&#x27;s due in part to this dryer.  Some reviewers have stated that they thought the dryer was a bit heavy to hold;  it&#x27;s not light weight but I have found it to be manageable.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is the most powerful hairdryer that I have ever used.  Infact, I keep it on MEDIUM speed, because HIGH feels too much like a tornado.  I love the variations it temperatures and the cold shot too.  You would think that with all these features that the dryer would be bulky, but it is surprisingly sleek and compact.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Infiniti Pro is slightly heavier (just over 1 pound) than the cheap $20 model used for comparison. The extra ounces do not seem like much, but when you&#x27;re holding the blow dryer over your head for 10 minutes, those extra ounces begin to feel like extra pounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a lot more powerful than my cheapy-model with a much greater output of air on both the high and low settings.  Hair dries faster (from 10-15 minutes to 5-10 minutes), but it&#x27;s more difficult to style hair while drying. It&#x27;s like trying to style your hair while driving in a convertible. If you style after drying, the Inifiti Pro is much easier because of the ionic technology. There was none of the static or frizz that comes from using the cheaper models--though it wasn&#x27;t completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti Pro is also much much much quieter than the cheapy $20 blow dryer. Normally, pets flee in terror when the blow dryer goes on, but the Infiniti Pro was quiet enough that they ventured into the bathroom to see what was going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw  with the Infiniti Pro are the button controls. There are 2 buttons; one for power (off, low, high) and one for temperature (cool, warm, hot). The buttons are extremely easy to push and placed in the center of the hand-grip so the act of just holding the blow dryer will cause you to push the buttons accidentally. While drying, I couldn&#x27;t help but to accidentally change the temperature setting about every 15 seconds... annoying but tolerable if you can find a proper grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, a great value for a $35 blow dryer. I would expect a blow dryer like this to sell for $50 or $60 on amazon and $75+ at a beauty store. Definitely worth the extra $10-$15 over the cheapy models.</li>
    <li> Conair&#x27;s hair dryer is powerful, both in the air flow, the heat temperature and its wattage. It has a comfortable grip, with the exception that it is heavy and if you have arthritis or weak wrists it might be difficult to handle. At 1875 watts it also is very powerful, do not attempt to use a normal extension cord with it, if you have done this with other dryers; you will need a heavy duty cord - those of us with older houses need to deal with this in some instances.&lt;br /&gt;The hot temperature immediately becomes too hot for most of my family, yet the warm is not hot enough, it is almost what the cool setting is on our previous dryer. For those in my family with very long hair, the high blow setting tangles their hair, so dryers with attached combs are a better option for them- this does not have a comb attachment. The  tourmaline ceramic and ion technology does not seem to dry out your hair or scalp, but for those with oily hair, it seemed to increase that factor.&lt;br /&gt;It is handsome looking and does dry quickly. Just make sure you want a powerful dryer, because this is what you will get.</li>
    <li> I have that sort of wavy hair that is almost, but not quite, curly.  For years I have worn it very long and taken lots of hours with big round brushes and heavy, expensive dryers trying to get a perfect blow-out at home.  After spending a big chunk of time in China, where my hair was subjected to some horrible water, I came home determined to chop it all off.  I did, without considering the consequences.  Now I have hair that is too short for proper blow-outs or even the smallest of straighten irons.  It is, however, long enough to be completely frizzy and uncontrollable.  Ah ha, now I remember why I keep my hair long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got my hands on this little beauty and was completely blown off my feet!  I was prepared to be unimpressed with a relatively cheap dryer that claimed it would give me \\&quot;shiny, frizz-free hair.\\&quot;  But then it actually accomplished that and so much more.  My hair may be short, but it is still pretty thick and can take a long time to dry.  Not with this baby.  I was done in less than 10 minutes.  Not only that, but I did not have to apply tons of product to get it under control.  My hair was shiny, frizz-free, and full of lift and body!  I cannot remember the last time it looked so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fairly small women, petite build and less than 5 feet tall, so this machine is a little big for me.  Please take into consideration that I am not the average sized person for whom this dryer was built.  Even with it being bigger than I am accustomed to, it was pretty easy to use.  The speed and heat settings are easy for me to switch while drying and they are true to name.  Hot is actually hot and the cold blast is actually cold, and high speed is really fast.  I love that you can take the filter out and clean it.  In a home with two people and two pets, filters can get clogged pretty fast.  Though I have tried to clean them, I have lost a couple of machines to burn out from clogged filters.  That is dangerous as it creates a fire hazard.  So not only is this good for your hair, but it is also good for your house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orange color is pretty attractive and the cord actually has a nice, reusable binding thing (I have no idea what it is called) rather than just a tie-wrap.  Since I stow my things between uses, this is much better than my usual fix of using an old hair elastic to wrangle the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this machine.  At this price, it cannot be beat!is this good for your hair, but it is also good for your house!

    <li> Very Durable blow dryer does what it suppose to do. A bit heavy but another then that a great buy.</li>
    <li> I had a conair FOREVER...since college about 15 years ago. It finally pooped out and I was in the market for a new one.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect in today&#x27;s updated world.  So I read a bunch of reviews and decided on a revlon...which wasn&#x27;t available at the store I went to. So I got my next choice which was this Conair...which has had fewer reviews in total, but on a percentage basis, has had more favorable ones than the Revlon I had previously wanted to hey...good choice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to the whole IONIC thing and I don&#x27;t find it to be anything amazing.  Perhaps my hair is flatter and smoother because of it, or maybe it&#x27;s just because this thing blows with significant force so anybody is bound to have flatter hair when using it.  It&#x27;s winter and my hair is not as static-charged as it has been in winters past, so perhaps I&#x27;m getting some help from the dryer in this regard...tough to know. I still have some static, but not as much as I have sometimes had previously. I do find that it dries my hair faster than my old dryer...maybe by a couple of minutes...instead of 6 minutes, I finish in 4.  This is significant because it&#x27;s pretty weighty.  Moreso than my prior dryer, but 4 minutes isn&#x27;t killing me.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on Warm and Lo.  I find Hot to be too hot and Hi is too strong a blower.  I have straight, fine hair just past my shoulders and I also use this to blow-dry my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s a little  aggressive for a 3-year old...her hair is fine and blows all around when I dry it. There&#x27;s not a setting I would consider \\&quot;gentle\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.  It&#x27;s totally acceptable.  Nothing amazing. It hasn&#x27;t changed my life, but most importantly, it hasn&#x27;t AGGREVATED me and so I can just keep moving along as though nothing has changed significantly.  The worst is when you have something you really like that breaks and you can&#x27;t find something to replace it that continues to make you just as satisfied.  So this hair dryer has accomplished that.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my sister and myself. I love the color and the power. Its 15 percent lighter than previous model but it could be a little more lighter than now.</li>
    <li> Nice looking, dries hair quickly, but the buttons to choose speed and temperature are exactly where one grips the handle.  It took several uses before I found a rather unnatural way to hold it while styling my hair.  I kept accidentally changing the air flow and temperature, which was very annoying.  Conair apparently doesn&#x27;t know a whole lot about ergonomics (or doesn&#x27;t care).  As someone pointed out in an earlier post, this unit is just a little on the heavy side, but not so heavy as to interfere with its ease of use.  All in all, a pretty good buy, however, amazon just dropped the price over $5.00 since my purchase a few days ago, which doesn&#x27;t make me a happy camper.</li>
    <li> The Infiniti Pro by Conair AC Motor Styling Tool WAS AN awesome product, I&#x27;ve had this exact item for about 2 years and it works great.  I used to recommend it but this one that I bought as a gift for my daughter started on fire within about 2-3 weeks after I gave it to her. Now noone will help me because it was over 30 days, but it was a gift that I had held onto for 2 weeks prior.  The part that stinks is thank goodness she noticed the fire or else my house could&#x27;ve burnt down.  So now I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT.  It would be terrible if it happened to someone else and they set it down without noticing the little fire inside.</li>
    <li> Cons:   The last blow dryer I had was a $12 model from CVS that actually was about the same size as the Conair Infiniti Pro, but weighed about half as much and was a lot quieter. So, I&#x27;m not sure if this dryer is actually heavier or louder than its similarly functioned peers, or just heavier and louder than a pretty cheap, non-ceramic bargain dryer.    I have really fine, short-ish hair that dries fast regardless of what dryer I use. I like a low temp/low flow setting, and as far as I know, the Conair doesn&#x27;t have one. Even the low power is more than the high power was on my old dryer, and the high power reminds me a little bit of being on the leading edge of a hurricane. At this point, I&#x27;m still struggling with technique to be able to get my hair to do what I want it to do, and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s come out a little messier than it used to because it dries so much faster.     It&#x27;s also quite hefty weight wise (maybe due to the ceramic?) and loud (to the point that I&#x27;m considering ear plugs to prevent future deafness).     Pros:  It is ionic and my hair comes out a ton less frizzy and with more body than it used to with the old dryer, so I&#x27;m pleased that I have no more fried ends. It feels nicer, too.    There are a ton of settings! For heat, you can have cool, warm, or hot (plus separate cold shot). For speed, you can have high or low (though as I mentioned before, for me they are all high).    I do use the included attachments and I&#x27;ve had a little better control with them. As others have mentioned, no diffuser included.     If my box is correct, it also comes with a 4-year warranty, which I think is nice. I&#x27;ve had some in the past that have lived almost forever, but my last dryer only made it a couple of years before it burned out.    All in all, I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price and I&#x27;m planning to keep and enjoy it. I think some of the cons related to speed are probably beneficial to people who have thicker hair who need the extra power to dry it.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer! It makes my hair feel great afterwards. It is a great quality hair dryer. The air blows strong and its not too hot, but gets the job done without using too much heat on your hair.</li>
    <li> As soon as I took the hair dryer out of the box, it felt very heavy.  But I decided to give it a try anyways.  It took 15 min to blow dry my medium length hair and I had to rest my arm several times.  I can&#x27;t imagine having to style my hair with this dryer or holding it for more than 5 min.  It is too heavy!  I immediately returned the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she found it was way to heavy for her hands when I took it out the box and put it at different blow dry angles in my hands I realized it was to heavy also and I would get tired using this so I sent it back to the store.On a good note it is a very pretty dryer the shape is nice.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after reading the reviews- they don&#x27;t lie! I have long hair- right passed my boobs- and it used to take me like 30-40 min to dry my hair with my old dryer. This one takes 20 min tops. It&#x27;s not lightweight, but it&#x27;s not necessarily heavy either. It also blows cold air out the back so don&#x27;t expect to warm up while using it :P Also, don&#x27;t get your hair too close to that cooling fan or it will suck it in! haha. Otherwise, it works great, I love the color, and it does what it advertises. Cord could be longer, though. Just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit for my wife after destroying her old unit. She is very pleased with all aspects of the dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a rock solid dryer for a very decent price. The dryer is lightweight, but has a nice build quality and nothing feels flimsy or cheap. The performance of the dryer is top notch and it is hard to imagine far more expensive dryers delivering much better performance, especially if you factor in price/performance.    I&#x27;ve used a few Conair products in the past, mainly a folding, retractable travel dryer that I have had for well over 10 years and if this model holds up as well as the travel dryer it makes this an excellent value.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is truly a powerful invention. Once you turn it on the blast of strong air really dries ur hair quickly. In terms of noise its not too loud for the amount of air it blasts. Overall a good investment for a good blowdryer at an affordable price</li>
    <li> For the price I would buy this again! Blows strong and with good heat despite the facts it is pretty loud and heavy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it FOR the warranty though, would end up costing half it&#x27;s price in S/H to get replaced if it broke the box says!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now, and it really is a nice dryer for the price.  It has a great variety of heat and fan settings, and I love that the cold shot button is easy to access.  That being said, it really is a loud and heavy dryer! It you don&#x27;t mind those aspects of it, it&#x27;s a good dryer, but just be warned that using it for awhile can really take its toll on your hand and wrist.</li>
    <li> I have medium-thick, shoulder length, curly hair and this blow dryer straightened my hair in under 10 min. No frizz at all! I am going to give this blow dryer as Christmas gifts. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and it takes a long time to dry. This is a powerfull machine I have two one for a back up because I dont want to be with out it.</li>
    <li> The Conair 259 Infiniti Pro hairdryer sounded so promising.  So, after my old hairdryer started to smell like a pile of smouldering ashes, I set out to purchase the Conair.  I eagerly anticipated this new hairdryer drying and smoothing out my thick hair quickly and giving it a nice shine without using a flat iron.    I flipped the switch and...whoa...it&#x27;s unbelievable how loud this thing is!  I&#x27;m not usually one to worry about loud noises (I work in a school and the playground gets pretty loud).  But seriously, I wonder if I used this thing so close to my ears what it might do to my hearing long term.    The amount of wind generated is pretty powerful.  If I don&#x27;t use the concentrator attachment, I end up with a tangled mess because it&#x27;s like standing outside on a windy day.      The dryer does not get nearly as hot as my previous dryer which means it takes longer to dry my hair.  I don&#x27;t have 30 minutes to dry my hair on a regular basis, so back to the store it goes.     One last note: I read somewhere that this dryer was supposed to have a professional length cord (usually 8-9 feet), it doesn&#x27;t.  The cord is about 6 feet long.    UPDATE: I have used the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer for the past month and love it!  My hair is in great condition, the cord is longer and dry time is considerably less that with the Conair.</li>
    <li> Much too heavy; easily 3 times heavier than my previous 1875W ConAir dryer. Deafening; painfully  loud. Ineffective; I have shoulder length, thin hair. After 3+ minutes of hoisting this thing and damaging my hearing with it, my hair wasn&#x27;t even close to being dry.  Awful. And it does not come with a diffuser; only 2 nearly identical concentrator nozzles. This dryer is just one of those cheap, end-cap impulse-buy gotchas. Not recommended!</li>
    <li> I just started using this hair-dryer a few days ago -- am completely satisfied and pleasantly surprised.  Lots of power, features all work perfectly, well built, solid AND it actually does a great job giving you nice shiny hair in a very short period of time.  Also appreciate that the cleaning filter is easily removed for quick cleaning.  I can&#x27;t believe all hair dryers don&#x27;t have this feature. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this product before I decided to buy it.  I have medium length, fine-medium hair and this hair dryer dries my hair quickly and there is little to no frizz when I am done.  This is my first ionic hair dryer and I am very pleased with it.  The dryer is not that heavy, like some of the reviews had mentioned.  The buttons are easy to manuever. You do have to watch where your fingers are around the handle because the buttons switch very easily between settings if you touch them. The settings are accurate with regards to temperature.  I saw the same product in stores for about $5-$8 more than the Amazon price.  Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> I presently own the Professional Remington which I liked till I tried this one! I have very long fine hair with a little wave and this hair dryer works perfectly without over drying and frizzing up my hair. Even without any attachments it seems far more concentrated and directional then the Remington. I also like the easy to figure out buttons that say hi for hi and low for low rather then some weird symbol that tells you who knows what like the Remington which leaves you hitting all the buttons blindly trying to find the right setting, that drove me nuts. This one has a nice low setting that is just perfect and doesn&#x27;t blow your hair all over your face and warm is just hot enough for my fine hair without drying it out. It is quieter then the Remington and about the same weight which I don&#x27;t find too heavy at all. It is very comfortable in the hand no awkward wrist turning required and the nozzle is a bit shorter which makes it more directional and lets you keep it a safe distance from your hair. I liked that my hair kept the curl with this hairdryer, other dryers leave my hair poker straight and fly away frizzy. I would certainly choose this hair dryer without hesitation it&#x27;s a great unit and the color is great fun too! Get it!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my wife, thinking it would come with a diffuser as mentioned in the Amazon product listing. It does not include a diffuser, only two concentrators.    So if you&#x27;re looking for a hair dryer that comes with a diffuser, look elsewhere. The one we ordered is back on the truck to Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is, without a doubt, the best dryer I have ever owned. Four years ago I bought a Conair Cordkeeper dryer, very similar to the Conair Infiniti 223X model. It has been my daily dryer ever since, but a couple weeks ago the sliding switch that turns it on got stuck in the on position. I figured that since that Conair had served me so well for all those years, I didn&#x27;t need to spend all the extra dough to get a new dryer that cost hundreds of dollars. So once I narrowed it down to the inexpensive models, I was choosing between this model, the Conair Infiniti 223X, and a handful of Remington models. Finally, I pulled the trigger and ordered this one, since the reviews seemed slightly better than the Infiniti 223X. I was really skeptical that it would be any better than my old dryer, but I AM SO GLAD I order this! This dryer is nothing short of astounding, and I can&#x27;t believe I paid only $30 for it. Let me break this down:    PROS:  (1) SO POWERFUL. Although it is an 1875-watt model like my previous dryer, the airflow coming out of this feels twice as strong, no exaggeration. I feel like I&#x27;m in a wind tunnel when it&#x27;s on High.    (2) Accurate heat settings: The warm is a true warm, and the hot is a true hot, but not too hot as to unnecessarily damage your hair.     (3) A Cool button that works instantly: I&#x27;ve never had a dryer whose Cool button actually shot out cool air quickly. The ability to switch from hot to cool in seconds really helps hold your style, especially if you are drying your hair with a round brush. This one just works like it should.     (4) Lightweight: The people on here who complain about the weight baffle me. Have they ever used a dryer? I weighed this dryer and my old dryer on my kitchen scale and this one is much lighter. It&#x27;s easy to hold and use for the duration of drying your hair.    (5) Dries your hair fast: No exaggerating, this cut my dry time almost in half. The extra power and the accurate heat settings really make a difference.    (6)Great results: My hair is soft, shiny, and styled as I desired. I thought the faster drying time might make it look more damaged but the opposite seems to be true.     (7) Long cord. This is a really nice feature if you dry your hair in a room with plugs in inconvenient locations.    CONS:    (1) It&#x27;s slightly louder than my old dryer, which seemed to produce an average amount of noise. I&#x27;ve never had a truly quiet dryer so I don&#x27;t care that this thing is slightly louder.     (2) No cord keeper. This, again, is a very minor complaint. In an ideal world this dryer would have one, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.    In sum: I simply don&#x27;t see how anyone would regret purchasing this dryer. I have long, layered, average thickness hair that always seems difficult to dry. But since I got this dryer, it&#x27;s been so much easier, faster, and the results are exactly what I want. I just hope it is durable. It feels like an absolute tank, but I&#x27;ll report back in a few months.</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer a month ago and it works very well for me.  It&#x27;s a little heavy and does not have a folding handle which I don&#x27;t like.  Other than that it&#x27;s a good hair dryer. The drying time was about half less than with my old one.  I like the smooth and comfortable feeling of my hair after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the hairdryer.  I like the color and the price was right but that&#x27;s about it.  The dryer is heavy, loud and doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough.</li>
    <li> I ordered this dryer as a replacement to my beloved Conair 223x that recently gave up the ghost after 5 years of service.  It is an o.k. hairdryer. I used it several times before I noticed a problem with the heating element. I can&#x27;t find anything fundamentally wrong with it, but it&#x27;s going back in favor of another 223x.    So, here are my pros and (kind of) cons:    Pros-  -It&#x27;s built like a tank. Very solid, sturdy plastic that looks like it could take a couple of drops to a tile bathroom floor like a champ. It&#x27;s not really that heavy- I think it weighs in at just over a pound. Lighter than my old 223x.  -I love that it has so many heat/intensity options. This allowed me to be able to do a low intensity with a high heat. Perfect for my fine hair.   -Powerful motor, even on low setting. It cut down on my drying time by about 5 minutes.  -I&#x27;m not big on using attachments, but the ones included with this dryer are sturdy, and they stay connected really well. I tried using one of them the first time I used the dryer, not my bag. I took it off- not the dryers fault, just mine.    Kind of Cons-  -Nope. Not whisper quiet, but it&#x27;s not as loud as other 1875w dryers I&#x27;ve used. Kind of had an annoying high pitch whine, much like my boyfriend when he has a cold.  -Rocker switches would be better placed on the side of the handle. Not a huge problem as long as one is able to mind their fingers.  -Does not actually have a diffuser as the listing states, just two concentrators. Well, maybe it does, I don&#x27;t know. It has one concentrator and one thing that looks like someone shot a concentrator with a pellet gun.    It did great the first few times I used it, then I noticed that the heat wasn&#x27;t as hot as it was the first couple of times. (I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s a defect, so I don&#x27;t want to base my whole review on that!) This is essentially the reason it&#x27;s going back. I mean, yes...it&#x27;s a hair dryer and it did a great job of drying my hair, so mission accomplished as far as that goes.It made my hair nice and smooth and shiny as it states it will, but it didn&#x27;t give that same umph of volume that my old dryer did. My hair looked good, but not as \\&quot;OHMYGODIWANNADOCARTWHEELSCAUSEMYHAIRLOOKSSOOOOGREAT\\&quot; as the 223x managed to give me on a daily basis. I bought this dryer because I wanted to try something different (and it was pretty and orange!), but ultimately I&#x27;m sending this back in favor of another 223x.</li>
    <li> I guess in comparison to other regular hairdryers this one might be ok.  But it does not compare to salon dryers and for the price - pay an extra $10 and get the VS model that is sold here on Amazon.  It is much better.  This made my hair look very bad.  Flat and lifeless (my hair usually has so much body).  Its also heavy &amp; loud and doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as it should.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a Revlon dryer I&#x27;d had for 6 years that just wasn&#x27;t working anymore. It is definitely powerful. The high setting is much stronger than the one I had. However, even on high heat I sometimes feel it&#x27;s not hot enough. I&#x27;ve tested it on my hands and it definitely gets very hot, but it may be that when it is at high power you almost can&#x27;t feel the heat. My hair is long and dries within 10-15 minutes on high with high heat, which is still pretty good.. It is fairly compact, though does take a little getting used to (and maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;d been using another dryer for so long). I LOVE the color, btw!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a couple of weeks ago and what a waste of my money! its loud, heavy, and the hot setting is not hot but barely warm. I have long hair and it takes me over 1/2 hr to dry. I just purchased a twin turbo one and i just hope it works better. I&#x27;d rather pay a little extra and have something that actually works. Save yourself trouble and don&#x27;t buy this, its awful!</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer! It adds nice volume to my fine hair, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer Ive ever used. I borrowed my sister&#x27;s during an out of town trip. As soon as I could I bought one. Powerful air force dries hair in half the time. Slightly heavy, but worth it. Get one, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try the expensive ceramic tourmeline dryer but just couldn&#x27;t justify the expense. I got this one and love the speed it dries my hair. I was also impressed with the power of this motor. It is not much stronger than the one I was using but seems like a lot better. Can&#x27;t find anything negative. Even the shipping was fast. It was here in a couple days. This was my first Amazon purchase but won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
    <li> I liked this so much I bought several more and always recommend it to friends.  This is by far the best Conair I have ever used.  I was not a Conair fan until I picked up this dryer - I figured it was relatively inexpensive and well rated, so why not?  I have purchased more expensive brands ($100+) that aren&#x27;t as good as this beauty.  It isn&#x27;t too heavy or loud, but really puts out a powerful amount of air, and HOT air (I like higher heat to straighten my wavy hair).  But my color processed hair doesn&#x27;t get damaged even with using this daily on high-hot (note I use a color safe shampoo and condition everyday).  Position of the rocker switches is a little annoying but not problematic really.  Cord is thick and long.  Nozzel is good at focusing the air.  It is reliable and lasts a long time (I&#x27;ve had one for a couple of years now).  The only difference between this and my pricier dryer maybe is the directionality of the air? This seems to blow around a little more than my other dryer, but it is a very minor detail, and one I can easily live with for 1/3 of the price.  I can quickly dry and style my hair as desired (MUCH quicker than most other dryers).  This is a great dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t even try this hairdryer out after purchasing it because it was too heavy.  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of dryers before and this seemed to be the heaviest.  If you&#x27;re used to using drugstore hairdryers (nothing wrong with that) then you might not be able to tell the weight difference.  However, if you use professional dryers, this might not be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra money (if you have it) and invest in a powerful, durable, lightweight dryer like the Sedu Revolution Pro Tourmaline Ionic GREEN 3600 hair dryer.  Now THAT will change your hair and your life.  It&#x27;s $159.99 on Folica.com, but they often run promos with 25% off, etc.  It&#x27;ll last as long as you want it to.</li>
    <li> I owned this hair dryer for over two years in which it got used by my wife and I every day. While it worked it was a fantastic hair dryer which made any hair dryer you used while traveling or staying with friends seem terrible. One day it wouldn&#x27;t turn on and began smoking. I looked online and saw the hair dryer comes with a 4 year warranty so I called up Conair to report the problem. They told me to put the hairdryer in a box with my return address and the case # they supplied and that UPS would come pick it up from my house at no cost to me, and then once Conair received it they would exchange it for a new one. This particular model was backordered so it was exchanged for the similar green model which I received just TWO days after my initial phone call. Great customer service and a great product that they stand behind. Five stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this blow dryer off Amazon after my old one blowing up..... this is a great product for the price. It dries your hair very fast !   I love it.... I would definitely recommend it to others !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for several years and thought it was time for an upgrade.  Having heard rave reviews about the T3 dryers I thought I&#x27;d  treat myself to the best. I bought the $250.00 model and, after a two week trial period, returned it. It made me realize how great the Conair Infiniti Pro works! Tho a bit noisy, it dries quicker and is more powerful than the T3</li>
    <li> I have long hair and blow dry my hair almost everyday...so I need a great blowdryer-on a budget.  I have looked into buying the expensive T3 blowdryers but just couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much money on a hair dryer. For the price I love this dryer.  It dries my long, thick hair quickly!  I would think the \\&quot;wisper quiet\\&quot; claim is an exaggeration.  It is still just as loud as every other hair dryer I have owned.  For the price this is a great product.  It is nice and sturdy and I plan on using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how fast I am able to get my hair done in the morninings.  Warning!! It is a powerful little machine!! Recommending this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I thought it had everything I wanted in a hair dryer... But when I used it about 10 times, it started to break. Within the first 2 minutes of turning it on, the motor would wind down getting slower and slower and I just shut it off. This is manufactured poorly do not buy it. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with a hair dryer before.</li>
    <li> After my nearly decade-old Conair hairdryer died, I purchased one of the pricey \\&quot;pro\\&quot; hairdryers last year. I loved it until it broke. There was no corporate information on the box, so the store I bought it from put me in contact with the manufacturer&#x27;s customer service. It was a man&#x27;s cellphone in Chicago. Months of phone tag ensued, during which he would never answer and would call back while I was at work, never leaving instructions on how to exchange the item. I finally gave up and came back to Amazon for another new dryer, one made by a reputable company.  After comparing reviews of other pro (i.e. expensive!) dryers like the T3 against the Infiniti Pro by Conair AC Motor Styling dryer, I decided to go for it and I&#x27;m glad I did. The heat settings, speed options, and cold shot all work flawlessly. The concentrator attachment stays on easily. It&#x27;s light and easy to use. My hair dries quickly and is as smooth as when I leave the salon. AND the dryer looks great in orange. I give this product my highest recommendation for quality, looks, and value.</li>
    <li> my wife had this on her christmas list, the twins got it for mommy,and she has praised us ever since.she loves it, and says the heat and cool settings work perfectly,,and this blow dryer is this quitest one i have ever heard, with bathroom door closed you can&#x27;t even hear it, i would recomend this product...it&#x27;s wourth the money,,wife loves it and she says every girl\women should get one................happy styling.....and the color lites up our bathroom.....&lt;br /&gt;  Grant \\&quot;Z\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer after the one I used for 6 years finally blew out. Unfortunately, the one I received had a shortage and felt like it was going to explode. I called Amazon customer service and the sent me a replacement free of charge and with one day shipping!! The new one works great! I use it 1-2 times a week to blow dry my own hair and when I give my dog a bath. He seems to like this one alot more than my old one because of how quiet it is and the cold/warm/hot options. It also gives you the option of having it blow high or low speed, which is great. It dries my hair really fast too! I have really thick, shoulder-length hair and it dries in less than ten minutes. My hair also seems a bit healthier due to the decrease in drying time. I love this one! I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because of the psychological stress caused from the first one... haha</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a hair dryer when this appeared as a Vine option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so glad I decided to give it a try despite the repulsive color.  I have deducted one star for the orange.  I like my hairdryer to blend in with the decor of my bathrooms and I don&#x27;t have orange in my bathrooms - actually I don&#x27;t personally know anyone who has that particular color in the decor of their bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is an excellent hair dryer.  A bit on the unbalanced side if you have wrist, hand, or arm problems, as I do, but it drys so well and so quickly that hasn&#x27;t actually been a negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t take me forever and that after I do dry my hair there are no fuzzies or wiry ends sticking out, but rather smooth, slick curls and waves that look professional and make the time I spent on my hair all together worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this particular hair dryer for those persons like myself with thinner hair, but hair pourous enough to take quite awhile to dry.  This Conair dryer solves that problem!.  I guess the odd design, which is a bit awkward, might be required to house the workings of this particular type of dryer, but still, again, it didn&#x27;t have to be orange.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace a 10+ year old Conair hairdryer that finally died. This hair dryer has a ton of power. I have baby fine hair and have to dry my hair on the medium setting to keep it from blowing everywhere. I can&#x27;t say how it will work on other hair types, but it dries my hair in just a few minutes. I&#x27;m loving this orange hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Three words: BUY THIS DRYER!    In the market for a newer, more efficient dryer, I researched several brands and was surprised to learn Conair offered some highly rated options.  While I would love to own the $200+ model my hair stylist uses, my budget simply does not allow me to shell out that kind of money for something to blow hot air through my hair.  After careful consideration, it came down to two different options--this model and a Conair model that retracted its cord after use.  While a handy feature, I thought it would be just another thing that would wear the dryer down over time, so I opted for this model instead.  I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID!  This dryer is light, dries your hair quickly, and most importantly to me, leaves you with virtually NO FLYAWAYS.  I use one of the two concentrators included with the dryer and my hair is smooth and shiny all day.  Honestly, my hair ends up looking as good as it looks after being dried with my hair stylist&#x27;s high end salon dryer.    If you&#x27;re looking for a fantastic dryer at a very reasonable cost, definitely check this model out.  IT&#x27;S IN FOXY METALLIC ORANGE, TOO!</li>
    <li> I had two other hair dryers before I got Conair Infiniti Pro.  So I will do some comparison on these three.   I own Conair Ion Shine Dryer 1875 Watt Cord Keeper about three years. I liked the dryer and it does the work. I really liked the cord keeping ability; therefore I got the Conair 169R 1875-Watt Cord Keeper Folding Hair Dryer for travelling purpose two years ago.    Conair Ion Shine Dryer 1875 Watt: the heat is hotter when it is on high, but the air relative low compare to the other two.  It does the job but takes a while even on high heat high air setting. It is the heaviest of the three.   Conair 169R 1875-Watt Cord Keeper Folding Hair Dryer: the heat is relatively lower when it is on high and the air relative is high compare to the Ion Shine which will not hurt your hair and dry the hair a little faster than the Ion shine.  It is also lighter than Ion shine.  However, my hair still has some frizz after use.   Conair Infiniti Pro: I got this dryer yesterday. It is definitely a better dryer than the other two. It has the right heat setting and air flow to dry the hair faster than the other two. My hair feels really soft after the first use. The noise level is reduced a little compare to the other two. It is kind heavy but lighter than Ion shine.</li>
    <li> Love the orange color...nice and quiet, heat not too harsh on hair. I find that my hair actually dries quicker with this blower.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I would have - a small one, is that the directional attachment does not stay on tight. It moves around, but I can live with it. Mine came with an awesome diffuser too...just in case I want to wear my hair wavy.</li>
    <li> I always thought hairdryers are all the same, but this one is not created equal. I did some research and noticed a lot of people recommending AC motors, this and that. I was always a fan of Conair products, so I scooped this one up because the color called out to me and the price was right. Its been a few months now and I have noticed how great this dryer works compared to the ones I would occasionally swap with. This one is definitely stronger and makes quick work with my long, thick and frizzy hair, with one of the attachments. If you have thinner hair, I can see how this might be too strong for you (try one of the two attachments though, it might work) but its perfect for my hair type. I had to take a star away because it is on the heavy side. On the days I want to blow dry my hair super straight, it takes a good 10-15 minutes, and halfway through, my arm is ready to tap out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to replace a previous Conair.  She has thick below shoulder length hair and this blowdries it in 4 minutes flat.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is a little thinner and longer and it only took 2.5 minutes.  It does not leave their hair looking like a \\&quot;fluff ball.\\&quot;  My wife has not had to straighten her hair quite a few times after using this hairdryer.  I really like the AC motor because they last longer.  I had bought a Remington 18 months ago that had an AC motor, but it doesn&#x27;t blow near as much air.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer for the price.  Very powerful and dries your hair fast.  Only thing I wish it had was a lower power level when styling.  I&#x27;m buying two more for my college girls.</li>
    <li> I was debating between this blow dryer and a pro one. I&#x27;m so glad I opted for this. It honestly works just like a pro one. I dried my hair in about 12 minutes (it normally would take me 1/2 hr since my hair is so thick and long). My hair also looked like i just stepped out of a salon!! I am recommending this one to all my friends. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My old hairdryer had this annoying habit of blowing hot and then cold (if you know what I mean). I finally gave up the ghost and ordered this puppy after 1) the stellar reviews and 2)the orange color. I got it *super* speedy, and then I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHOA. BLOW MY HAIR DRY WHY DON&#x27;T YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful *and* quick, which is just how I like it. (TWSS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair, and when I used this the first time, it&#x27;s true, it makes your hair WAY smoother than a normal dryer.  I&#x27;ve had $100+ hair dryers (don&#x27;t ask me why. I think it was my mom&#x27;s and I stole it.) and this is easily as good, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure here - I rarely use a blow dryer and my old dryer is more than 5 years old. I did not realize what a dinosaur it was until I opened this beauty.  The dryer is very stylish in design and the ginger orange color is bold but appealing. The unit fits nicely in the hand and is weighty enough to control but not so heavy as to be burdensome. The three heat settings (Hot, Warm, Cool) are about what you would expect. The lowest setting is more like a slightly warm air than a true cool - which I like. There is also an ice blue \\&quot;Cold\\&quot; button that produces an arctic blast of cold. The buttons are placed on the nozzle side of the unit and are easy to adjust when using the dryer.     I used this dryer myself and found that it dried my hair nicely and did not cause excessive tangling or frizz. I particularly liked the fact that my long hair was not caught by the back vent as sometimes happens with other dryers. I also tried this dryer out on my kids. They enjoyed the warm and cool settings and thought the arctic blast was a hoot. Their shorter hair dried quickly and had a healthy shine.     A great dryer for a very good price.</li>
    <li> To make it brief maybe the best for $35.00. Yes all the Six features work! I also use to dryoff; and a heat gun. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This review is not based on the effectiveness of the Conair Infiniti Pro, I never had the chance to use it. I received this hair dryer yesterday after my ancient Revlon dryer finally died on me. First of all, the box in which the dryer was shipped was partially crushed. Luckily, I opened the box to find that the product was still intact and in mint condition. Phew! Unfortunately, the second that I lifted it out of it&#x27;s packaging, I knew it wasn&#x27;t the dryer for me... Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a great looking tool, but it was SO HEAVY! Again, I don&#x27;t know how well it actually dries the hair, but for anyone that is looking for a lightweight hair dryer, this would NOT be the one to choose.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife since I don&#x27;t have enough hair to justify the need for one.  Must say that she agrees with all the positive reviews and really likes this one. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I had read in one of the reviews that this hair dryer was too heavy, but I did not find this to be true.  It is easily handled and quite efficient.  It dries quickly.  I love the bright orange color.</li>
    <li> I bought the updated version of this at Target, on sale, a few months ago for about $26.  Retails for aout $30.  I also considered some decent ones, even a Conair, at Marshall&#x27;s.  After checking all of them, this particular Conair was the best for me.  It is Model 259MP. The box had a UPC that said 2012, perhaps the year it was made or updated from this orange one.  I think the orange color was still available at Target when I bought this, but since this came with the diffuser, it was a no-brainer--and, I don&#x27;t like orange!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is fuschia in color, and INCLUDES the excellent, though large, DIFFUSER as a bonus in the box--perfect for my very curly hair.  Also comes with a sleek black concentrator for smooth styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is everything it claims:  full-size, yet relatively lightweight, quieter than all the other Conairs I&#x27;ve owned in the past; perfect selection of heat choices with &amp;#34;rocker&amp;#34; switches (easier to use than the other kinds), and well worth the extra few dollars.  I have arthritis in my hands, so ergonomics is important, and this one delivers as best as I could ever expect in a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the fantastic work, Conair!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a travel Revlon 1875. In two words, it stinks. Seems to have a lot of power but doesn&#x27;t dry nearly as well as the small Revlon. Don&#x27;t waste your money,.</li>
    <li> This Dryer was advertised as comparable to $100 blow dryers but i personally think that its no where close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I am a male who mainly using the dryer for styling purposes as well as occasionally drying my hair. Below are pros and cons of this blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Blows very strongly on high&lt;br /&gt;Thats about it... everything else is fairly standard for a dryer such as weight, button design, and shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not get hot, mine is just warm like a hot wind on a 90 degree day&lt;br /&gt;- Even on low this blow dryer blows too hard to use for styling hair (so far all hair styling products have been blown out of place and/or shaped badly because the dryer blows too hard and doesn&#x27;t dry fast enough)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if your looking for a blow dryer that will dry your hair with minimal heat and a lot of air flow, or you want to look like you were just in some kind of hurricane, this is the dryer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a blow dryer that blows hot air and is easily controllable for styling look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair almost to my waist.  I bravely went to spend two weeks house sitting for my aunt without my blow dryer because she said she had one and I needed the space in my carry on.  She had this flashy orange thing waiting for me.  Holy moly!  So, wait, let me describe my current blow drying experience.  My blow dryer screams every time I run it down a section of hair as the motor struggles to force air through my crazy hair; creates a kind of rhythm to the whole experience, right?  And it&#x27;s super hot so I briefly see those rather artistic looking curls of smoke rising from the back of my head.  It takes me about 13 minutes to blow dry my hair, depending on the humidity and how long I&#x27;ve let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this flashy orange thing:  First impression was not good.  It blows really hard and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets very hot.  But it was the only blow dryer in the house, so it&#x27;s not like I had any other options, right?  But then I used it...and it dried my hair in about 8 minutes.  And it was so smooth!  No smoke!  It did tangle the ends of my hair the first few times I used it, but I think it was the way I was using it.  Once it&#x27;s mostly dry, I started flipping it to the medium air setting and that solved the problem and didn&#x27;t seem to add to the drying time.  Me!  With the crazy long and thick hair using the MEDIUM setting!!  Plus, when I got home and had to use my blow dryer, I realized I use the air to flip my hair around my shoulders and the blast from the orange one was too strong to do that without tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks, I thought maybe I was romanticizing this orange thing and when I got home and used my blow dryer I wouldn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  I was wrong.  Old red Revlon blow dryer was a trooper, but I used it one more time and got on Amazon to order a flashy orange thing for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize:&lt;br /&gt;-Very strong blast of air at the high setting, but don&#x27;t be afraid to adjust it.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets very hot, but that might be a good thing; my hair certainly likes it.&lt;br /&gt;-Fast drying (took between 8 and 10 minutes on my hair, which makes it abt 25% to 40% faster even though the humidity was off the charts at my auntie&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;-I didn&#x27;t really notice an issue with the weight, but I run four miles 3x/week with 5lb weights in my hands, so you probably shouldn&#x27;t ask me&lt;br /&gt;-It sounds like a blow dryer.  The pitch isn&#x27;t as annoying as some blow dryers and it doesn&#x27;t scream when you hold it to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> PROS: I bought this blow dryer because I needed one with both a flat and diffuser attachment. I liked that it could fold for travel, and that it was branded as &#x27;salon professional&#x27;. It feels like a high quality product. The attachments are sturdy when they clip on and the blow dryer itself has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: This blow dryer mimics the effects of riding a motor cycle on a highway on a spring day without a helmet. It blows way too hard, with very little heat, and will leave your hair in tangles. I have very long, very thick hair. Although I brush while blow drying, I had to completely stop and (painfully) brush out every minute or two. Not worth it. With all the extra work, it took me twice as long to dry my hair and I ended up with a tangled, frizzy, puffy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have short hair, this product might work well for you. If you have long hair, STAY AWAY!</li>
    <li> Crazy quick... salon power..and can&#x27;t see this dryer breaking down on me.&lt;br /&gt;Posting this at 10:30 pm because I was very impressed with the way this&lt;br /&gt;works! Had a cheap-o dryer before thought I&#x27;d spend just a little more&lt;br /&gt;this time and waa laaa it&#x27;s 100% worth it!Don&#x27;t let the orange get to you&lt;br /&gt; As for it coming with the&lt;br /&gt;attachments such as a diffuser purchase it at wal-mart (thats your best&lt;br /&gt;bet.) Price is just right on AMAZON:) like always</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer! I have thick wavy hair and it now only takes me about 10 minutes to dry my hair rather then 25 or 30!  This dryer also comes in pink on the conair website but it is cheaper here and only in orange though. Four stars because of the cold button because it does not get super cold but it is cooler then the hot.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy hair and this dryer dries my hair pretty fast.  I also bought it because of the price.  It is a good quality dryer for a fair price so not much more to ask for.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of research and read lots of reviews on products before I purchase them.  I check out Amazon, Walgreen&#x27;s, WalMart, and the manufacturer&#x27;s site before I buy things. I may also google to see if magazines have recommended the product.    For this hairdryer I did just that.  Amazon had the best price so I bought it here.  I had a Infiniti by Conair® model: 207R for years. It still works great, I just lost the concentrator attachment so I decided to buy a new dryer.    Now, let me tell you what I think about this hair dryer:  1. Compared to my Conair 207R, this dryer is much lighter in weight! I read reviews saying this dryer is heavy; that is a complete mis-characterization. Unless you have a miniature, veryvery cheap, or travel hairdryer that weights less than the average hair dryer, this one is NOT heavy at all. This dryer is the lightest hair dryer I have ever used.  2. This dryer is also a little smaller in profile than my Conair 207R, which makes it easier to maneuver.  3. The air force is actually less than my Conair 207R, but this dryer still does a phenomenal job.    Now, I must say that some people say in their reviews that a hairdryer leaves their hair frizzy or poofy. I often wonder what in the world they put in their hair before they dry it!?  YOU MUST PUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HAIR BEFORE YOU BLOW DRY IT! You need some kind of heat protector and frizz control serum!  No hairdryer is going to make you hair smooth and sleek without product!  If your hair is wavy or curly, it will never be sleek and smooth when you blow-dry it without straightening with a round brush or a styling tool.    I love this hairdryer! It&#x27;s a gorgeous orange color. The AC motor is awesome when you use a round brush (have straight hair but I like the finish of round brush blow-drying) and need the hairdryer to be on for long periods of time!    You can&#x27;t beat this price for an AC motor hair dryer that works so well and has such a sleek, light profile!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer worked great! Then the plug broke. I only had it about 1 year. I think a hair dryer ought to work a little longer than that.</li>
    <li> We found this product from a Harpers Bazaar top 10 review of blow dryers.  Almost all of the dryers were over $60. This dryer works great and is powerful.  It drys our hair quickly. We actually use the medium setting as this dryer is so powerful.  Good buy so far we have no regrets.</li>
    <li> Bought the purple version of this at a superwarehouse store.  I like the product, but am giving it a 2 star because I have long hair and straighten it with the dryer...a concentrator is a must...the one that came with this unit falls off several times while I\\&quot;m drying my hair A N N O Y I N G.  would have returned it except for it was such a good deal.  If you don&#x27;t need a concentrator then this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife and she loves it. Told me it dry&#x27;s her hair in half the time of her old one. Although not a hair dryer user she told me it is great!</li>
    <li> My fiance has needed a new hair dryer for the longest time and when she saw this one she knew this was the one she wanted.  I got it for her for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.  She&#x27;s so very happy she has her new dryer and can get rid of her old broken one.</li>
    <li> Just got this after my other dryer that I&#x27;d had for probably 7 years died on the high setting.  This hair dryer works well. I like it. It doesn&#x27;t seem any quieter or louder than any other dryer and I don&#x27;t necessarily notice more of a shine in my hair (but really, how can a hair dryer add more shine??). I do like that it seems to cut the drying time in half! Very quick to dry my full head of hair which is great!  Definitely good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;It looks as pictured - and it&#x27;s very cool looking.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job as promised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;It is not any quieter or louder than any other blow dryer.  It&#x27;s the same.  So why describe it as quiet?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not light - it&#x27;s not heavy, but it&#x27;s not any lighter than any other standard hair dryer.  So why describe it as light?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a hair dryer.  It doesn&#x27;t get super hot.  But it still dries my hair in a reasonable amount of time.  And it looks cool.</li>
    <li> I picked this hairdryer up in purple at costco for about $20 recently.  I was impressed the first time I used it.  I&#x27;ve always ended up with frizzy hair after blow drying, even with the ionic hairdryers but not with this one!  My hair is smooth, shiny and straight every time.  I do use a round ceramic brush to help speed up the drying time and the flow nozzle attachment.  I can dryer a layer of my hair with one or two swipes with this one where as others take much longer.  I did notice that this hairdryer doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other hair dryers I have used but my hair still dries faster.  I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m frying my hair while drying it (that&#x27;s how I felt about my old Revlon one!)  I also use the cool shot all over at the end of drying my hair, I think it&#x27;s suppose to lock in the style?  I tend to research anything that I buy and plan on using for a long time but this was an impulse purchase.  So glad I picked this up, I would definitely buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/27/13: I love this hair dryer so much that I invested in a second one for travel/back up.  This hair dryer is still being sold at my nearby Costco for about $20.</li>
    <li> When visiting my sister in another state recently, I used her hair dryer rather than drag mine along.  Well, this is the dryer she had.  Right away I noticed how much faster my hair dried with hers than using mine at home.  It has one of the most powerful motors I&#x27;ve found in a hair dryer and not only really good heat settings, but also when you push the button for cool, it&#x27;s 100% cool instead of just warm like most.  It&#x27;s easy to hold and love this dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because the price is just affordable. I&#x27;m not a big fan of it because it gives my hair frizz after the blow-dry. I&#x27;ve been using this alternative one http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Ac2015-Tstudio-Collection-Ceramic/dp/B003V264WW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1342979303&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;remington+pearl+dryer and it works amazing!</li>
    <li> I ordered this blow dryer thinking I need something that is going to last me through more than 3 months.  My hair is super thick and it normally takes about 45 minutes to FULLY dry my hair.  I used this blow dryer for the first time yesterday and my THICK hair was dry in about 30 minutes, so it cut down about 15 minutes of dryer time.  I received the extended parts with this dryer, but there are no instructions on how to use these parts, the attachment is as big as my head and I have no way of knowing how to work it?? But after all is said and done I am more than happy with the dryer itself.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer under a year ago. I have long, curly hair, and usually use a hair dryer in pairing with a flat iron. I personally liked this hair dryer, because for the affordable price, it was also decent quality. It was relatively light weight, but my favorite part were the two attachments for the head, and also the different settings. It has a Hot, Warm, and Cool setting along with a High and Low setting. Because my hair requires some serious heat, I would usually use it on Hot &amp; High, a few times a week (not 7 days a week). Here&#x27;s the catch. It just shut off in mid use and started smoking out the front and back. That is to be expected of hair dryers, but I am disappointed that it happened in such a short lifetime. As I said, I have only owned this dryer for less than a year, and I don&#x27;t even use it on a daily basis, so as much as I enjoyed the quality given the price, I am rather disappointed it just up and blew up/started smoking so quickly. My overall recommendation for this product, it is better than some other hair dryers I have used in the past. It has great settings, attachments, and weight for the price....but keep in mind you get what you pay for. I suppose if you want a longer lasting dryer, consider dropping a bit more coin. Good quality dryer for the price, but the lifetime was a letdown.</li>
    <li> My over-priced ION hairdryer quit on me one morning when of course I was running late. Frustrated, I looked at reviews online to see which hairdryer is reliable and performs the best. After careful consideration, I found the Infinity Pro and decided to get it based on all the positive reviews. Well 7 months later and the hairdryer is still running awesome, love how smooth it makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> I have super damaged curly hair that I straighten on a regular basis, so having a good blow dryer is essential to me... this one did NOT disappoint! Cut my blow dry time more than in half, quiet and powerful. I LOVE it. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is in better shape due to not spending as much time under heat. I am so glad I bought this product.</li>
    <li> I have been needing a new hairdryer for several years now.  I absolutely love the power behind this sleek looking hairdryer!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer works well enough. I have two complaints about it though. The first is that is on the heavy side for a hairdryer. The second, which is the biggest complaint, is that it draws so much power I have ended up tripping the circuit breaker in my house. I bought this to replace a hairdryer I had that burned out. My previous hairdryer had the same wattage and never tripped the circuit.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that usually takes forever to dry. With this hairdryer, my hair is dry in record time. I love it!</li>
    <li> Muita gente havia falado mal mas nao acreditei, ele é pesado, fraco, demora horas pra secar meu cabelo que é fino e liso. Nao recomendo de jeito nenhum</li>
    <li> Everyone who&#x27;s used my Conair 259 Infiniti Pro raves about it&#x27;s power. My daughter, whose hair is long, naturally wavy, and super thick, says it&#x27;s the most powerful hair dryer she&#x27;s ever used. At 1875 watts, it is indeed powerful, and I and other users find that it gets too hot on the highest heat setting. The \\&quot;true cold shot\\&quot; button is handy for quickly bringing the temperature of the blowing air to an unheated temperature (which I wouldn&#x27;t describe as \\&quot;cold\\&quot; given that it&#x27;s just unheated blowing air). The dryer is stylish looking, and is a bit heavier than cheaper, less powerful hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned and own (I have a dryer that I use just to speed up the drying time on watercolors that I paint). I wish I had this dryer when my mom was alive. Like my daughter, she had super thick hair and drying it for her when she got to the point (due to Alzheimer&#x27;s, etc.) that she could no longer dry her hair herself, it always took what seemed to me like an interminably long time to dry her hair with towels and a cheaper, less powerful hair dryer. This one would&#x27;ve made the process considerably easier and faster. Definitely recommended to anyone in the market for a good quality hair dryer to use at home.</li>
    <li> My wife and I just love this Conair 259 Infinit Pro.  It is a little heavier than the Conair dryer we had previously, but these features make this a must next buy for Hair Drying equipment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a cool air blowing feature.  The previous one only had hot and warm buttons, but the cool air helps to keep from frying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the filter that is easy to remove, makes it so you do not have to come up with some ingenious method to clean out your hair dryer.  Fun stuff when you think about the things you need to do due to dust or other things that slow your dryers performance.  This is so easy, you wonder why this was not done so much sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last neat feature for me is the more compacted nature of the blow dryer.  Usually, a dryer of this substance is much larger and unwieldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair 259 Infiniti Pro has solved a few problems that maybe we did not even know existed.  I would imagine there are more to come.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer of 15 yrs is still working but not as good so I decided to replace it with this one that I saw at costco for 1/2 the price because it was on sale. I got the purple one. I love the 4 yr warranty and multi-function features! My aunt also bought one for her daughter who is going to college this yr.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a small hair dryer.  I live in an apartment and the neighbors never complained about the old hair dryer but they did mention it. The compact hair dryer that this purchase replaced was quite loud.  This new hair dryer is much quieter than the old one.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much quieter it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s easy to clean.  The black cap at the end that the air goes into has a screen and is removable for cleaning. There is a non-removable screen behind it. Most of the dirt gets trapped between the two screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 (10/27/2012):  This still works fine and I use it most days of the week.</li>
    <li> Before owning this hair dryer, I owned a cheap $20 conair hair dryer. I rarely used it as it got super hot and made my hair dry and slightly damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular hair dryer comes with a great variety of features. Instead of just high, medium, and low setting, you can also set the heat level that comes out of the hair dryer. It also comes with a blast of cool air that is suppose to help style your hair. I think the orange color of the hair dryer gives it a nice look and definitely attention grabbing. One thing to note is that you cannot hold this like you would a normal hair dryer. The buttons get too easily pushed and I find that I have to hold it on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conair 259 is quite light and easy to use. It did take about as long as my old hair dryer but that&#x27;s probably due to the fact that it&#x27;s not constantly blasting super hot air at my hair. The burst of cool air works pretty well too. After using this, my hair is super smooth and soft. It is definitely a nice hair dryer and I think the price of this hair dryer is also super for what it can do. Another thing is that after using this for about 10 minutes, I put my hand on the nozzle and it did not burn me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Previous hairdryer was having problems: would overheat regularly, and need a cooling off period.  This one, no similar problems.  Heats up quickly, blows well, adjustable settings, the cord is long enough, so it&#x27;s fine.  My only minor complaint is that the buttons are awkwardly placed... hard to adjust while using the thing.  Otherwise, much better than my previous one.</li>
    <li> This is a little orange monster! You will be amazed at how quickly your hair can be dried. It is indeed on the heavier side, but you won&#x27;t be holding it for very long to get the job done. It works great, and it actually quieter than my old drier. I think the $100 value sticker is kind of cheesy, but I suppose that it&#x27;s true - this seems to do a comparable job to any salon dryer. Sometimes I find that I accidentally push the rocker switches while I&#x27;m holding it, it&#x27;s a little learning curve to hold it correctly. Comes with 2 different nozzle attachments, although I&#x27;m not sure which one is best for doing what since it&#x27;s not spelled out anywhere. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy wit this dryer - it&#x27;s a great investment for something that you use almost every day!</li>
    <li> Why was this hair dryer given such great reviews?! When I got it, I plugged it in, put it on LOW, and it blew my headband off! Back in the box it goes.    However, it would make an excellent leaf blower.</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer with alot of power, but doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  My hair drying time has almost been cut in 1/2 compared to my old dryer.  My hair is still frizzy after drying, (I have naturally kinky/curly/frizzy hair) but once I apply heat from a curling or flat iron, my hair is much smoother, manageable and healthier looking than before.  For those who complain about the orange color...  Who cares - it&#x27;s a blowdryer, not a fashion accessory you wear out in public.  lol!  Mine stays hidden under the bathroom sink most of the time anyway.  If I think about it -(which I don&#x27;t) I actually rather like the color, myself - it&#x27;s different. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It works fast and has several settings. I think it is one of the best hairdryers I have ever used, I have thick hard to dry hair.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is definitely worth the money.  I have no budget for high salon products but still want to have manageable and shiny hair.  This blow dryer has been great!  It is a bit on the heavy side, but my arm is already used to it, and I love the way the attachments help style my long, thick hair.   If you are on a budget but don&#x27;t want to sacrifice quality, give this unit a try.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries my medium long hair efficiently in a short time.  It is compact in size, but somewhat heavy.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does not get very hot. I like the color and it is not too heavy. I wish I had known the hair dryer did not get very hot or else I would have probably considered buying a different brand. Other than that, this hair dryer works good.</li>
    <li> The last hairdryer I bought was quite a few years ago, until it croaked and I bought this one. Looking at the other reviews, I was pretty sure that I would like it, but was somewhat worried about the weight people kept mentioning. Well, I have to say that weight is not an issue with this hairdryer.     Among the features that I really like are the slightly curved handle, which lets me hold it easier, as well as the filter on the hairdryer, since the last one blew up due to being clogged. Also, this one allows you to choose the temperature and speed of the air; this, along with the ionic feature, I find to be extremely handy since my hair easily gets tangled and over dried. The attachments are also very handy and I&#x27;ve found that they do work to either encourage straightening or curls. While some people might not like the color, I really like the orange. Makes it look speedy.    The one problem I have with it is the length of the blower itself. I sometimes find myself clunking my head, especially when I have the attachments on, but that is more due to my old blower being very petite.     Overall, I really enjoy this blower and would highly suggest it to anyone looking for a hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Its really cute and its my favorite color but it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. The hot setting feels more like either warm or cool. Takes twice the time to dry because of this.</li>
    <li> After my trusty purple Conair Ion Shine died after 5+ years of use (and about 5+ years of me constantly dropping it), I was in the market for a new hairdryer. I checked multiple \\&quot;box stores\\&quot; and read lots of reviews on Amazon and settled on the Conair 259 Infiniti Pro.     Pros: Relatively quiet, as far as hair dryers go. It comes with two concentrators which is handy in the event that one breaks/wears out. My hair is left smooth and shiny and the heat is even. The low/high, hot/medium/cool controls are useful to customize the heat and speed to your preference.     Cons: The back of the dryer is not detachable. My old dryer had this, and it made it easy to remove the eventual lint that always gets trapped in the filter. I do not know if this will affect the life expectancy of the hairdryer. And on a superficial note, the orange color is hideous. The only redeeming thing about it is that I&#x27;ll never loose it in my bathroom. That said, I&#x27;m happy to put up with the tangerine nightmare as long as it continues to do its job and do it well!</li>
    <li> In summary: 4.5 stars out of 5. I highly recommend this \\&quot;styling tool\\&quot; (what would we do without marketing people?) aka, blow dryer, and I would have given it 5 stars easily if the buttons were less prone to unwanted changes. Don&#x27;t let that stop you, it&#x27;s probably just my big fingers...     I bought this for my wife who has a massive amount of hair and needed a better/faster blow dryer than our previous which was an 1875W dryer with a DC motor - this one has an AC motor.     Most noticeable is that this thing blows hard, fast and moves a large volume of air compared to our last one. My wife reports that it leaves her hair manageable, full and feeling and looking good. I can vouch for the looking/feeling good part.    After about a week of use, my wife said that it&#x27;s the best hair dryer she&#x27;s ever had.     The cool shot works well and the heat settings seem right - not too hot, nor too not-hot.    The dryer seems a bit heavier though smaller in size than our prior dryer, but the wife says its not really noticeable once you get going.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend needed a hairdryer in a pinch because we moved and left the old one at our last residence. After some searching, I came to the conclusion that this would be the best one for the price. This was only meant to be a temporary solution, but I&#x27;m happy to say it will be permanent. The design and construction is solid, it doesnt feel cheap. It also outputs some seriously powerful hot air. My girlfriend has long hair (about 24 in long) and it used to take 20 minutes to dry her hair out of the shower. It now only takes 8 minutes. I&#x27;ve also tried the hairdryer out and it dried the back of my head in under 30 seconds.  I highly recommend this hair dryer if you&#x27;re looking for a solid purchase at a relatively cheap price. It really impressed me and had the build and quality of a higher priced Chi appliance.</li>
    <li> i would like to say, it&#x27;s totally worth the money.the external material is stronger as i expected, and it drys my hair real quick.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer because of its Conair name and good price.  I received it and found out that it is very heavy to hold.  The weight makes it very hard to dry hair and try to style.  The reason for the two stars is price and the settings on the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Wow is all i can say. I cut hair and needed a good dryer. Didnt want to pay  alot. This dryer has a lot of power. Saw it in a department store. Almost twice as much for it.Nice color also.</li>
    <li> I have long, curly hair that I blow dry straight. High heat and little damage is important. Though the airflow on this one was sufficient, the heat level didn&#x27;t come close to the 5-year old model I&#x27;d been using. It took twice as long with results that weren&#x27;t nearly as good. Maybe I got a bad one - but I&#x27;ll look elsewhere for a more suitable alternative.</li>
    <li> I considered a T3 but, the more reviews I read I began thinking, maybe I really don&#x27;t need to spend that much. Plus, some of these dryer reviews stated the dryer would burn out, even the expensive ones.  I saw some good reviews on a particular Revlon and some Conairs.  My previous hair dryer (Pilmatic 2000) which is a professional version of Conair (from Sallys) had lasted about 7 years. One day it made a high pitch squeal and seemed to lose some of its power.  It still worked but not as good, so I decided it was time.&lt;br /&gt;On the description for this dryer stated it was an \\&quot;AC\\&quot; powered motor and I wondered what&#x27;s that about?  Googled and found an interesting explanation of AC vs. DC motors. AC Motors: larger, heavier, but less noisy, more durable.  They operate on lower RPMs, which results in less stress put on the moving parts. This leads to a longer lifespan and less risk of breaking down or burning out. Typically AC hair dryers blow stronger than DC dryers.  DC Motors:  Blow dryer is much smaller, lighter, reach high speeds very quickly, and produce greater airflow for quicker drying.  Since they run at higher RPMs, DC motors tend not to last as long and individual pieces of the dryer are subject to wear.  In other words, you have to pick your poison and decide which features are most important to you, b/c you can&#x27;t have it all.  I like the price of this one; I don&#x27;t have to always have the latest and greatest (at least with a blow dryer) and I don&#x27;t want to go shopping again in a year for a new one.  I knew I wanted Ionic and Tourmaline as I live in humid FL- this one had these options.  Also, based on the description of different motors, I assumed my old dryer was an AC motor.  I had been overall pleased with my old dryer so I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is straight &amp; my strands are fine in diameter; I have a lot of them so I would describe my hair as thick.  The drying time has probably been cut in half as it was taking me around 20 minutes (when my olddryer was working properly).  I actually have to be a bit careful b/c the straightening effect of the &#x27;Ion&#x27; can make my hair kind of flat.  However, I am compensating by using a little bit of a scrunching technique or I let my hair air dry a bit more and do other things in my morning routine first (because now I don&#x27;t have to worry about any little frizzies my hair gets from air drying, b/c the  Ion&#x27;s from the dryer will take it out when I finish up w/ the dryer).  I do recommend this dryer; it appears to be around the same quality of my old dryer and I suspect will last just as long.  Also, the hook is not visible in the pic but there is one.  In addition, I do not have a lot of upper body strength and I do not find the dryer too heavy.  It is actually lighter than my old one.  Also, the cord on this dryer is a bit shorter, it is about six feet long,  my old dryer&#x27;s cord was crazy long.  But I will live with that.</li>
    <li> This dryer was recommended to me by a coworker who had just gotten it and loved it. I was skeptical since she has very thin hair and mine is extremely thick, but I decided to check it out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: the cost! I couldn&#x27;t believe it was one of the least expensive out there. After reading the instructions they recommended a lower setting than what I felt would dry my thick hair in a reasonable time, however, they were right! Quicker drying time than any other dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. And the ceramic really does work to eliminate static! I used to have to use conditioner every day to eliminate the static especially in the fall and winter, however, I decided to try without and see what happened and I&#x27;ve decided I can cut down my conditioner use to once a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: can&#x27;t think of a one!</li>
    <li> Average sound level for a hair dryer but more quiet than the wife&#x27;s old one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that this dryer will make hair mor managable and promote shine. My wife and I&lt;br /&gt;watched the video on Amazon about this dryer and she used the tips we saw there. She was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Not any heavier than my wife&#x27;s previous hair dryer but much easier to maneuver. All in all, a good buy.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing. The speed is easily 2x faster than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. Cuts drying time in half. And it&#x27;s pretty cheap! Love it.</li>
    <li> I am sort of disappointed in this dryer. It has lots of \\&quot;wind\\&quot; I guess you could say, but it doesn&#x27;t do as good a job with drying my hair smoothly as my old $20 one that recently conked out. Maybe it&#x27;s user error, but I don&#x27;t think so. With my old one, I could get my wavy/curly hair smooth and straight really fast. I spent the extra bucks based on good reviews and the hope that this wouldn&#x27;t stop working in one year like my cheaper one. Well maybe it will last longer; I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity yet. But it sure is making my morning hair routine frustrating! The dryer seems not to be as hot as my old one, and the blast of air, maybe it&#x27;s too strong. I tried it on low but then it wasn&#x27;t enough. Plus I keep accidentaly turning it off because the buttons are right underneath where you hold it. I think I might give this away to someone without the need to blow out curls and get another el-cheapo for myself.</li>
    <li> Solid made,top fit and finish.I love this blow dryer.Even the motor sounds like quality.Nothing about this hair dryer is cheaply made.It works as well as its made.Get one, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Just about every blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever borrowed from a friend (while traveling. I don&#x27;t go around from house to house, \\&quot;Say, can I borrow your blow dryer?\\&quot;) has sucked so bad, I&#x27;ve labeled myself a blow-dryer snob. GIVE ME POWER OR GIVE ME DEATH!! Preferably power. But anyway. My last dryer died after an appropriate lifespan, so its successor is now this orange piece of fabulousness. I had a hard time with it at first, because for how quickly it dries, it&#x27;s actually pretty quiet. I guess in my mind, noise equals power and power equals quick-dry. So it took me about a week to get over it, because while I couldn&#x27;t deny that it dried just as fast as my old friend, it was so quiet I had a hard time believing the results. But after a little practice and some meditation exercises from the therapist inside my head, I got over it.</li>
    <li> I tried a Revlon product and didn&#x27;t like it. The blowing speed was insufficient, even at the highest level, even though it was a 1875 watt. This product has good blowing speed, and I think the difference is that this product has an AC motor. I rank this as a 4 (80%) because I&#x27;m aware of a 5 - the SuperSolano. It costs about $85 on Amazon. Up to you if you want to spend an extra $60 to get the remaining 20%.</li>
    <li> It sucks my hair up into the fan. I have to be super careful while drying my hair and it seems to get really hot one morning then barely warm the next time it&#x27;s used. Nice weight but I&#x27;ll have to give it only 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good hair dryer for a few weeks, and then ran into this little guy at work. I usually don&#x27;t purchase an item before looking at reviews, but the four-year warranty along with the sale going on won me over, instantly. Plus, there&#x27;s always the return policy. I chose red over orange and folding green, because I really wanted to try the diffuser, and who wants an orange hair dryer?&lt;br /&gt;I brought it home, plugged it in, messed with the diffuser a bit as well as the concentrator, and my hair came out looking better than it does when I let it air dry. The dryer worked really fast, although that came at a price--it was pretty loud, even on \\&quot;low.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t have frizz, and I had a decent amount of volume for my hair type and length.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;ve never even seen a diffuser until opening this box. The one that comes with the red Infiniti Pro is HUGE. My hair is naturally extremely straight, so I can&#x27;t really do much with a diffuser, but it&#x27;s definitely come in handy after letting my parrot, Buddy, take a bath or shower. He&#x27;s a smaller parrot, comparable to a cockatiel in size. He&#x27;s also a bit skiddish, and anything too loud or big can knock him right off my shoulder. The dryer might be loud, but when it&#x27;s on the lowest speed and medium heat with the diffuser on, he doesn&#x27;t mind being dried at all. Just a little tip for you bird-lovers.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re looking for a good, speedy hair dryer for a reasonable price, I would definitely recommend this product. If you&#x27;re looking for a quiet or compact dryer, look elsewhere. Overall, I am glad I picked this thing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that products tend to wear down, so I will definitely update my review if this product fails. But as of December 2012, all is well.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new hair dryer when I found the Infiniti Pro. This was by far the best purchase I have ever made for my hair. It has settings for cold to hot with a, \\&quot;cool shot,\\&quot; button to lock in the style. The amount of air that this thing produces is insane! I have long hair, and what took me 20 minutes to dry before, now takes me 5. After reading some reviews, some are saying that the weight of this dryer is too difficult to manage. However, as a person who has had multiple dryers, I didn&#x27;t find this one any heavier than the rest, unless you had one of those little tiny ones from the 80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;  As for my hair, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the, \\&quot;ionic technology,\\&quot; but my hair looks like I just stepped out of a salon everyday! I have NO FRIZZ and I get more compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve had this dryer than I ever have! Many of the girls that I work with went and bought one soon after I bought mine and love it! You&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
    <li> The only complain - it&#x27;s heavy. We&#x27;ll see how long it will stay working, but if I can use it at home for 5+ years I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> I used my old one every day for a few years. My kids also. I replaced it and am very happy with it. Good styling tools. Not heavy or too noisy. Great price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer less than 7 weeks ago. I loved how powerful and how quick it dried by hair. This product is very poorly designed though. While drying  my hair I accidentally dropped it a matter of inches onto the counter and the head completely snapped off. Now I have had other hair dryers in the past where they would occasionally drop (nothing too hard) and they would be perfectly fine. The first time this drops a matter of inches it completely snaps. Conair&#x27;s customer service was absolutely no help stating that since it was an accident they will not replace or work with me at all. The box states it has a \\&quot;4 year limited warranty\\&quot; and  a \\&quot;up to 3x longer life\\&quot;, this to me is very deceiving. I found this product to be EXTREMELY poorly made. Since this was not considered a defect in the manufacturing, the quality of this item is VERY poor. I will NEVER purchase another blow dryer like this again.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It&#x27;s less noisy than others, although I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34;. It has several different settings and it&#x27;s quite powerful. Hopefully, it will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Have always been a conair girl, it was about 5 years overdue to upgrade my old dryer. My husband purchased this for me. Works great! I love the 3 heat settings. My hand sometimes turns the dryer on and off while im drying my hair, but no biggie! LOVE the orange color!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude. My hair is fine, blonde, relatively straight/wavy, and fairly medium length, maybe 4\\&quot; or so at the longest. Without drying my hair, it will curl, flip, and friz like crazy. I don&#x27;t particularly like the Goldilocks or Farah Faucet look on myself.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just long enough that my old dryer was taking too long to dry. It also didn&#x27;t quite have the force required to actually attempt to style or add any sort of volume/spikiness to my hair. I did a little research, and found that what I needed was MORE POWER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Queue the Home Improvement \\&quot;Tool Time\\&quot; grunt here&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AC Motors seem like the way to go. Substantially more airflow, quieter operation, and consistent heat output that doesn&#x27;t burn the heck out of my scalp and give me dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has been awesome. Full blast and medium heat, my hair is dry in like 30 seconds. I can spike and texture it much easier, and its often quite straight just from the force of the air blowing it flat. I even compared the airflow to my old DC motor dryer, and there was just no comparison. This thing has enough airflow to dry something 5 feet away - like a freaked-out, recently bathed cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet deal. Thanks, Conair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the only downside is that I have to put up with the relatively super crappy hair dryers at the gym and in hotel rooms. They just aren&#x27;t the same.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FRIS DRYER. I LIKE IT A LOT IS NOT LOUD LIKE THE COLOR ALSO CAME WITH A DIFFUSER THAT WAS A PLUS. THE ONLY BUT FOR ME IS A LITTLE HEAVY BUT THAT MAY BE CAUSE AM NOT USED TO USING ONE AS I SAID THIS IS MY FRIST ONE.  I READY THINK IS A VERY NICE UNEXPENSIVE PRO DYER</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy hair, and this thing dries waaaay too fast even on the LOW setting, which means I have little to no control over setting a style with it. It&#x27;s also very heavy and noisy. What I do like is that it works well with my diffuser, although it will blow the diffuser right off if I&#x27;m not holding it on with one hand (again, on the LOW setting). The cold shot button works nicely but could benefit from a locking mechanism, as it takes a lot of pressure to hold down. In summary, I would not recommend this dryer as a styling tool or for people with very thin hair and weak wrists. But if you have hair like Crystal Gayle, by all means...</li>
    <li> My friend had this blow dryer and told me about it. I had just had my hair cut and wanted to be able to style while using the tool that comes with the dryer.  It&#x27;s worth the money I spent, has many settings, including a cool setting that I was told helps to keep down the frizz after drying. Lot&#x27;s of power and less expensive then some of the others!</li>
    <li> We have three females in the house that use this dryer. My one daughter has very long thick curly hair, my other daughter has thick medium length hair and I have long fine thin hair and it did not dry our hair any faster. It actually may take more time to dry now.  The dryer is also on the heavier side. The only positive to the dryer is that is does make your hair softer with more shine.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for use with my Welsh Terrier. She loves to play in the snow and that means a major job in drying her hair.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustments are perfect in order to reach the different parts of her body.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer @ Target last week for $30. I loved the fushia color and after reading the box and comparing to other dryers I picked this one out. I have used it 4x and each time the suction vent on the back has sucked my hair into it causing it to either pull my hair out or me having to turn off the dryer and yank the clump out. The high setting is so powerful it dries my hair quickly but the power tangles my hair and does not let me style my hair easily. The dryer also does not get very hot, this isnt too big of a deal for me but I know it is for others.&lt;br /&gt; I returned the dryer and bought the same one that I have been using for the last 2 years at 1/2 the price.</li>
    <li> I love how powerful this hair dryer is.  It is a little bit heavy but since it blows so strongly I can dry my hair quickly without my arm being tired.  The heat settings are very appropriate.  I would definitely buy this blow dryer again but hopefully it will last as long as it claims to and I won&#x27;t need to for many years.</li>
    <li> The Infiniti Pro hairdryer has a power switch with 3 buttons - off, Low and High. To me, the High setting is pretty darned powerful and I couldn&#x27;t really see myself using it, although it may be more useful for someone with dense, curly hair, or perhaps someone with really long hair (Rapunzel?). The heat switch also has 3 settings - cool, warm and hot. Perhaps what surprised me the most about this device, given how powerful the fan was, is that the hot setting really didn&#x27;t seem that high. There is a third button for a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; - depressing it shuts off the heat so that it blows cold air...I assume this would be useful if someone were styling their hair and needed a quick shot of cold. Removing your finger from the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button will cause it to release, turning the heat back on...naturally, if you wanted the cool air permanently, you&#x27;d just use the cool setting on the heat button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairdryer comes with some accessories, although as a guy I&#x27;m not sure what most of them are for, sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I thought it was pretty neat - surprisingly quiet yet effectively powerful. I just would&#x27;ve ranked it higher if the heat had been warmer is all. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recieved a blue dryer with retactable cord that doesnt work well.  Also the handle is supposed to fold up on this one and I cannot figure out how it works.  the illustration simply shows it folded.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my sister in law who has very curly and long hair. It only lasted her a few months before the dryer blew out and stopped working (we got her the same blow dryer twice) She only used it about 1-2 times a week. We ended up buying her a professional, more expensive Turbo Power blow dryer and that has lasted her over a Year.</li>
    <li> Love my hair drier it is amazing. I would buy it again if I needed too. Fast shipping recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I have owned both inexpensive and expensive ($200+) model hair dryers, and this is my favorite!  The price is extremely attractive, and it works like a charm.  It blows a very steady and strong stream of air, without being too strong as to blow your hair all over the place.  Control nozzle works great.  The air temperature choices are nice and the cool shot is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great hair dryer - I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If you want a hair dryer that is light, easy to use, and that won&#x27;t be a chore in front of the mirror, the Infiniti Pro by Conair fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being lightweight has its downsides. You want a long lifespan or the ability to take a little punishment? Look elsewhere. You want big heat and quick drying? Look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti Pro handles easily and gives low to moderate heat, making it GREAT for styling and nuance. It&#x27;s very light and designed well for easy handling. If you&#x27;re the slow, sculpting type this is a great model for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But folks who want to get their hair dried and in shape in less than 30 minutes will be out of luck. This thing just doesn&#x27;t pump out the heat you&#x27;ll want, and its light design also means it can&#x27;t take a beating. (Do NOT travel with it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The speed settings and attachments are great features, and its light design is nice, just know what kind of user you are before you buy it.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and even on the low setting my hair was blown out of control.  Too much power can be a bad thing.  My hair felt brittle and straw-like after using this.  I have had other dryers that left my hair feeling silky, yet full of volume.  I am taking this back and searching for a new one.</li>
    <li> Awesome item, highly recommend.  Very good value for the money paid.  It has variable speeds, and dries fast!  Definitely will purchase another for my daughters!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very powerful and dries my hair quickly. However, it is almost too powerful. The lower speed is probably the same about of power as the high speed on my last hair dryer, it would be nice to have something a little softer. Also, I the cord is very short.</li>
    <li> I used to have a $250 T3 Featherweight until it died not 6 months after I got it. Honestly, I did not love the T3 and it was a blessing that it died because I discovered this dryer. For a tenth of the price, this dryer is way better. This thing seriously blows, but it doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to frizz out. Somehow my hair comes out looking soft and silky every time. It doesn&#x27;t overheat, even on the hottest setting. Some reviews I read complained about the weight, and while it is heavier than my featherweight, I have never felt like my arm was so tired it was going to fall off or anything. I&#x27;ve also used the diffuser for my naturally wavy hair and it works as expected. It&#x27;s been over 6 months since I&#x27;ve bought it and its still going strong. If you&#x27;re debating throwing down over $100 on a dryer, save your money &amp; go with this one.</li>
    <li> I did a little hunting in the store before settling on this hair dryer (after my previous Conair hair dryer finally quit after 8 years). I was pleased to find it at a much lower cost on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer itself is great. The different heat settings are just right, and the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting actually feels cool instead of warm like many hair dryers. The hair dryer is very similar to my previous Conair, so I am pleased that the quality has not declined over the years. It does come with the two attachments, though I&#x27;ve only used the concentrator. The price point was perfect and the hair dryer is excellent. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Conair hair dryers and this one does not disappoint!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought this hair dryer years ago, and I wish they made this type when I was a teenager. The Amazon reviews reinforced my decision to buy this product. Today when I walked into work, a friend asked me what I did to my hair. Did I have it colored? I told her the only thing I did was use a different hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is horrible. It is heavy and bulky. I have long thick hair and I usually get compliments on it all of the time. This dryer blows so crazy, my hair has looked fuzzy and like a scarecrow each time I&#x27;ve used it. This is going back. I ordered the dryer I had before. A conair silver nano. Can&#x27;t wait until it arrives! Oh, and the vent on the back keeps sucking my hair into it. Not good....</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer around for the money and the fact that it&#x27;s 120v!  Brit living in Vermont and missing the other 120v :)</li>
    <li> I had a cheap grocery store brand $14 hairdryer for three years before it finally died. It took forever to dry my hair, and left it frizzy more often than not. This hairdryer is quieter and dries my hair in less than 4 minutes. I just wish the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting was actually hot.</li>
    <li> I absolutely HATE this hair dryer! The design of this hair dryer is meant for show, not actual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1). Due of poor placement of the the settings, while using this dryer, my hands constantly turned down the heat or the dryer speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2). I have long, thick hair - and the ends of my hair would occassionally get caught in the dryer vent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3). Dryer vent failed to stay put. Ended up scotch taping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4). This dryer gives me ubber frizzies. When finished drying, I look like I just walked out of the Rain Forest.</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer. I&#x27;ve had it for about 9 months now and I love it. The only cons are that it is a bit heavy, and certainly not quite. I still like this blowdryer more than any I&#x27;ve ever had before.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer certainly dries my hair faster than any dryer I have used. The concentrator is great. I blow dry my hair for a few minutes without it and then put it on to focus on styling. The settings (high, low) and temperature (cool, warm, hot) are perfect for whatever style you are going after. The cold shot is great to cool down your hair before using a flat iron on it. I highly recommend this blow dryer, it&#x27;s such a great price for the quality.</li>
    <li> I am sure this blow dryer is fine for people without curly hair, but if your hair is curly, stay away from this dyer.  My hair is more frizzier than it&#x27;s ever been.  I tried this dryer for about a week now thinking maybe I was having a bad hair day, but every day my hair looked worse than bad hair from an 80&#x27;s bad hair band.  I have naturally curly hair and my hair never looked this bad..... EVER.  Thank God for pony tails and hair clips until the blow dyer I ordered comes in.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works as advertised. It has cut my drying time in half. My only complaint is that it is easy to get hair caught in the filter while you are drying, which is painful. That said, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Has two heat settings and two power settings. I use them all. The hottest is quite warm and the high setting is very powerful and very loud. It is also a bit heavy. All things considered though, it is a great dryer. It dries quickly and is orange to boot!</li>
    <li> Ok.  I never ever write reviews about anything, but it is an absolute necessity in this case.  This hair dryer is simply amazing.  My old dryer went out last week, and I was so disappointed.  However, I know now that it was a miracle in disguise.  Prior to having the Infiniti Pro, I would spend approximately 25 minutes drying and flat ironing my hair before I could even style it!  My hair is quite thick and wavy.  My hair stylist spends about ten minutes thinning my hair every time I go because it is just that thick.  Yes, I&#x27;m that girl.  But, this hair dryer is a godsend!  I can now blow dry my hair flat and evenly in ten minutes!!  Not even kidding!  And, get this, I don&#x27;t even have to turn on my flat iron!  My husband said that he is pleased that I have been released from the chains of bondage that was my old hair dryer!  You will love this hair dryer!  I guarantee it!</li>
    <li> Easily the worst hair dryer for the cost. It worked like a cheap hair dryer in a hotel. Worse, it nearly broke my wrist with it&#x27;s weight. While it has a powerful motor, all it does is create more frizz because it blows the already dried sections around like leaves in the wind. Seriously, do not bother, you will be pissed and you will have to spend $5 returning the thing.</li>
    <li> You seriously get what you pay for with this piece of junk. Don&#x27;t let all the hype and celebrity endorsement fool you. This thing sucks. Believe me, you&#x27;ll look like you came out of a tornado after using this thing.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these at my local drug store and loved it!  So, I ordered a second backup one for my vacation travel.  The one I received here is not the same blowdryer.  It looks the same but has nowhere near the power of the original one I purchased.  I don&#x27;t know what is going on, but am suspicious as to whether this is an authentic product.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was inexpensive, however it was chose as one of the top ten hairdryers in Marie Claire magazine along with hairdryers that were more expensive. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best blowdryer I have ever owned.  I have a very thick below-shoulder-length hair that tends to be wavy and frizzy.  In order to style it, I really have two options with a blowdryer:  use the diffuser to dry it on low heat while working my fingers through the waves, scrunching them a bit to emphasize the natural texture; or use high heat and a ceramic round brush to smooth out the natural texture as much as possible, then flat iron to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Infiniti Pro.  Diffuser (included) on, with even the high heat, and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz out nearly as much as it did with my previous blowdryer (which was a professional brand).  Diffuser off, regular old paddle brush, high heat: hair smooths out almost as well as did with my previous blowdryer and a ceramic brush, in about 1/3 the time.  I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is definitely loud, so this will wake up the rest of the roommates if you&#x27;re in an apartment with other people.  The dedicated cool-shot button is great, and helps set the style in an instant.  Three heat settings and two speed settings give you great control over your style, making it even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new blowdryer, this is definitely it.</li>
    <li> As many of the other shoppers have stated, this blow dryer is a little strong, especially on the high setting.  For this reason, I am not giving it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my hair is shiny and dries VERY quickly using this product.  I recommend it, although for those with wavy or curly hair the power might be a little much.  For those of us with straight, almost impossible to tangle hair, it works quite well.</li>
    <li> It is a very solid  professional build hair dryer,nice sharp orange color, easy grip handle and a very reasonable price, I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because of its features.  She wanted a $100 salon style which I thought was crazy.  So I got this one and she was very happy with it and its been very quality</li>
    <li> Pros- Excellent airflow, cheap!, warm setting is not too hot for delicate hair, quick drying time, limits flyaways&lt;br /&gt;Cons- heavy, loud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great dryer for the price.  I dry my 3 daughters&#x27; hair every 1-2 days.  The oldest has very thick, wavy hair which drys quickly with minimal flyaways on the hot setting.  The middle kid has thin, fragile, curly hair and the warm setting drys her quickly without damage.  The youngest has silky straight hair which looks beautiful after drying on the warm setting.  I like that most of the drying seems to come from the massive airflow as opposed to the heat.  I usually buy a professional dryer in the $150 range and made this purchase as a backup when Ulta was out of stock for my first choice.  I had planned to use this as a backup until my first choice arrived, but I think that I will stick with this one.  Bottom line- this dryer is comparable to much higher priced dryers.</li>
    <li> love the color. love the blowing strength it has.. definitely recommend to anyone that needs a new blow dryer (:</li>
    <li> The settings are perfect, high, medium or low and I love the power. I use the cooler setting in the summer. It is easy to manipulate as you dry your hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and silky!! Definitely noticed a difference in the texture of my hair.Love the cool color, too.</li>
    <li> The first day I used it it didn&#x27;t take long for my thick hair to dry quickly and it left behind volume and soft hair!  Good product worth the $</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s: quieter than my previous one--not silent, but better; unlike last dryer, this one has a lint screen cover that removes for easier cleaning and no buildup.&lt;br /&gt;Con: heavy-but I learned to deal with it, motor speed seems to vary for no real reason, saw it cheaper at Costco right after I bought it--but that one was green. Not sorry I got it, but I am very neutral on the whole experience.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this here, I bought mine at Walmart for $29.94 But I still had to come and write a review for this hair dryer. First off let me just say that I have had the same hair dryer (Also a Conair) for the past 9 years (Dryer was still just as good as the day I bought it, it&#x27;s just the button broke off) I was devistated that I had to now go buy a new one. I went back online and tried real hard to find model #141 that I already own just because I loved it so much. BUT... nobody had one so I knew I had to move on and buy something newer. I then spent the next couple of days researching online and looking for the best one I could find, one I knew I would be happy with and one that was of course a Conair. Well, I found this one, went and bought it, used it and wow I am in love with it already :) Not only is is quiet, it has the same power as the one I had for that past 9+ years. I was never a fan of orange but this orange just POPS, its actually a gorgeous color. The look and the feel of this dryer is fantastic for sure. I really can&#x27;t think of anything on the negative side. One last thing I must say is normally my hair after using other hair dryers gets all frizzy but this one didn&#x27;t ..must be the tourmaline ceramic and ion technology. I was so scared to go new, but I am glad I did!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter went off to college and took my good hair dryer.  She left me her Bedhead dryer which takes forever to dry my thick and curly hair.  Just got this dryer (unfortunately paid more at Target) and I love it! Lots of air flow, not burning hot.  Great buy even at Target&#x27;s higher price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for over a month, but I&#x27;ve liked it from the first use. I appreciate the power of this dryer. It dries quickly and works well to add volume. The cool shot is truly cool and seems to help lock in style. I have not found this dryer to be heavier or louder than expected. All in all, a great value. You can spend more, but I&#x27;m not sure you can do much better.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect blow dryer.  I like the curved handle, it feels sleek and easy to hold.  It is an awesome value!</li>
    <li> I owned this dryer for about a year, didn&#x27;t love it, didn&#x27;t hate it...until it started to smell funny when I was using it. I pulled it away and then it started to spark and proceeded to catch on fire! I&#x27;m so lucky it wasn&#x27;t near my head at the time!! I would beware when using this. I never had anything like this happen to me before!</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of very long, thick hair, and blow drying it is a time consuming nightmare. I&#x27;m pretty sure it never gets completely dry. When my fancy $200 dryer broke, I decided to try a more reasonable option. This actually looks almost exactly like the outrageously expensive one I once had and works better! I have never had a dryer work as well and as fast as this one. I am telling everyone I know how awesome this thing is. A 45 minute dry job has been cut in half. And I spent next to nothing on it. (The color is pretty, too). I feel silly gushing over a hair dryer, but it&#x27;s damn amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer because it was reccommended by my sister and her sister in-law. I&#x27;m sad to report that it didn&#x27;t work for me. It does not produce enough heat to straighten thin curly hair. The concentrator has openings on the side and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s helpful for a product that is already weak producing heat. I also found it to be too heave and the buttons are in an ackward place. You find yourself focusing more on not accidentally changing the settings than in your hair. I&#x27;m sorry but it is going back.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Infiniti Pro I&#x27;ve had in the past couple of years.  I thought it would last a long time since it has an A/C motor. Well my first one blew up on my teenage daughter and put black ash residue on her hands.  I replaced it with another one because I figured it was just a fluke and have had good luck with Conair products in general.  That was November of 2011.  Well, it just blew up on me today just 15 months later.  It sparked and made a noise so it&#x27;s back to Ulta I go to try something else.  I did like how it dried my hair and left it frizz free.  My daughter preferred using it to the cheaper one I bought her so the two of us used it almost daily.  Still it should last longer than that.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Both love it and are annoyed by it. I&#x27;m on my 2nd...er 3rd.  After 5-6 day a week use, the 1st one I got lasted about two years and then simply died one day. It didn&#x27;t give any symptoms that the motor was dying, that the air flow was impeded in anyway. There were no funny smells or sparks or odd noises. It. Just. Died.  Instead of giving it to someone to repair, I bought a replacement which was easier and faster.  The 2nd one lasted a whole of two weeks before the electrical plug began to emit a horrible screeching noise the second the prongs of the AC plug made contact with an electric current. I&#x27;ve tried three different electric plugs in the house, hit the reset button on the plug and waited an hour before trying it again. Same screeching results, so I returned hairdryer 2 for hairdryer 3.&lt;br /&gt;As a hairdryer though this is a pretty good machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loud, yes. Effective? Yes. I have shoulder length thick hair that usually takes at least ½ hours to style into a style that I usually followed up with a flat iron. This hairdryer did a perfect style in about 5-10 minutes, depending on how polished I wanted the style to look.  It has only two attachments, a  narrow flat nozzle that&#x27;s great for getting a more controlled blow out, and a diffuser. If you have curls this will pump up their volume in no time.  It&#x27;s also a little on the heavy side, and noisy but it does a good job. I wish they lasted and were made of better quality materials.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man. A big hairy man. I have hair from head to toe. So when I use my wires hair dryer,  I put it to work! This baby is powerful!  I spend little time drying the \\&quot; drapes \\&quot; as I have short curly hair. But the \\&quot; carpet\\&quot; is a whole different story! This dryer works great getting all the moisture at the bottom of the shaft. Her old one only seemed to dry just the outer short and curlys. I like it so much I nicknamed it Pamela,  it blows with the best of them.</li>
    <li> I like the color.&lt;br /&gt;It dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but&lt;br /&gt;it is kind of heavy but I am used to it now.&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of loud but alsi I am used to it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result:  I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> from day 1 - it never stayed hot.  always cycled between hot and cold.  will never buy again and don&#x27;t recommend.&lt;br /&gt;also REALLY heavy.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I did NOT buy this product on Amazon.  I bought it from Ulta.  However, I needed to review this so no one else goes through what I did...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this two or three times with just the diffuser attachment to dry my curly hair - worked fine for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until tonight when I went to blow my hair straight that it had issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me.  I did not like the straight flow attachment thingie.  It had I guess air holes on the sides, so the air was not directed where I wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem (and also why I&#x27;m returning it asap) was as I was drying one side of my hair, the rear of the dryer (I guess the vent area?) SUCKED UP my hair from the opposite side of my head and got caught in the vent.  I had to literally rip my hair out of it.  I don&#x27;t have to tell you have frightening this was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short, skip this dryer.  I just purchased (to replace) the Vidal Sassoon 1875w Full-Size Dryer here on Amazon.  I had my previous one (which looks exactly the same, minus the color) for many many years and it worked very well.  I hope this new one is the same!!  Good luck.</li>
    <li> Like a straightener or other hair tools, I was only in the market for a hairdryer because my current one died on me. It was quite tragic. Though I am not thrilled with the color (I liked the green one!), the orange dryer was offered at a better price. As far as function goes, I have nothing negative to say. It works great!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is nice, but not perfect as expected, it is still strong and protects my hair to be smooth</li>
    <li> When my other hair dryer quit working, I went to the store without reading any reviews and bought the purple and black Remington Damage Protection hair dryer.  When I first used it, I noticed that it did not have as much power as my previous dryer.  I was going to just deal with it the fact that it would take a little longer to dry my hair.  However, after a couple of days, I decided to read some reviews.  The Infiniti Pro was reviewed as being \\&quot;fast, hot, and durable.\\&quot;  Before taking back the Remington dryer, I bought the Infiniti to compare the two.  Even though both dryers have 1875 watts, the Infinity is definitely faster and hotter than the Remington.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dryer with a little more power, this is the one you want.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to hold, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space, and powerful enough to dry shoulder-length hair quickly. It&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
    <li> If your considering buying this dryer, buy it. I would purchase it again if I had to replace it. The one I have is still going strong!</li>
    <li> I love my new Infiniti Pro by Conair.  I love how quickly it dries my hair.  Weight is no problem.  Also came with a diffuser which I have never tried.  I am so glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> Be aware that this dryer is heavy, is poorly balanced, and it is extremely loud.  It blows a lot of air around (the shower curtain 6-7 feet away blows around as I use the dryer) and as a result it drys the sections of your hair that you are not trying to style.&lt;br /&gt;I have not purchased a new dryer in a good many years so I can&#x27;t say whether this dryer is better or worse than what is in the market place.  It may be very typical of what is available. My expectation was that it would be better than the old (cheap) dryer I was using - it is not. I would compare it carefully to others to make sure it is going to do what you want it to do before you purchase.</li>
    <li> I have always found it difficult in the past when I needed to replace a hair dryer. All of the manufacturers make similiar claims and it is hard to find enough information to make informed choices.  However, in this case, the Amazon reviews are right on target.  The Infiniti Pro 1875 (model 259) clearly stands at the top of the list of quality hair dryers. My objectives were to find a heavy duty dryer that would last, but that didn&#x27;t weigh a ton and had flexible settings that allowed me to find what worked best for me.  While the Ininiti Pro isn&#x27;t light, I find that it is ergonomically designed so that the weight is distributed and it doesn&#x27;t feel that heavy to me.  It is not quiet, but even on high speeds the sound is a smoother less irritating sound than most of the large hair dryers I have used in the past.  The motor just sounds high quality rather than that high pitched irritating noise you get with a lot of dryers.  It is true that it only has two speeds (Low and High), but the low speed is equivalent to medium on most dryers so unless a very low speed is necessary for you, I think you will find that the two speeds will meet your needs.  One of the things that I hated about my past hair dryers was that you either burned your scalp or it was too cold to do much good.  I don&#x27;t even use the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting on this dryer.  The warm with the low fan setting provides all of the drying power I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you don&#x27;t (hopefully) replace hair dryers all that often, it is worth taking some extra time to evaluate before you purchase.  This is the first time I have actually been totally satisfied with a hair dryer and my sense is that the Ininiti Pro is solidly made and will last a long time. It is not the cheapest hair dryer you can buy, but considering the high quality, it is very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a Revlon Tourmaline Ionic hairdryer that was frying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style wise, this rocks!  It&#x27;s a beautiful bright burnt orange.  I like the placement on the buttons being centered on the inside of the handle - it works well for lefties or righties.  I like the distinct temperature levels and the output of the dryer.  The ONLY fault I have is that it is obscenely heavy.  If you have joint pain or fibromyalgia - you may have to pass on this unit.  I find that my arms fatigue halfway through doing my hair.  It&#x27;s easily twice the weight of my Revlon unit.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and it dries my hair really well.  I have had issues with other hair dryers sucking my hair in through the back and snagging it, but I have never had that problem with this one.  It also has a really sleek design and a pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of heavy compared to my old hair dryer, but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> I have loved this hair dryer and it has performed wonderfully for over a year until this morning. That&#x27;s when it went out in a blaze of glory, shooting sparks out the front like a roman candle. There was sizzling, crackling, and it was terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because up until this morning it was a great hair dryer, a real 5-star gem. But I&#x27;m subtracting a star for the near heart-attack it gave me when IT died.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to save fireworks for the Fourth of July!</li>
    <li> I wanted a new ionic drier for our kids that wasn&#x27;t as loud as our traditional hair drier. I got this one for the reviews on the powerful drying. Everyone&#x27;s reviews said this was not very quiet, but I ordered it as ours was already very loud, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. It turns out that this is indeed loud, but it actually lacks the high pitched squeal that you get from normal hair dryers. The is loud because of the low motor noise mixed with the amount of air that is being pushed out. Air can be pretty loud!!! Because it doesn&#x27;t have the squeal that I hate, I can actually talk while using it, loudly, but it really is much better than the old one!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned and I have owned quite a few in a wide price range.  This beat a high end designer type  hair dryer I owned hands down!  This hair dryer is not light but not so heavy as to be cumbersome or unmanageable.  I&#x27;m 64 years old and have no difficulty manipulating it.  It&#x27;s also as noisy as any other hair dryer but then again you won&#x27;t be using it as long as most other air dryers as it really does dry hair faster.  It&#x27;s interesting because there  is a silky quality to the air it blows out ( the ionic effect? ) and that same silky quality translates to the hair.  My hair feels great, looks shiny and bouncy.  That&#x27;s not an easy feat as I have fine processed hair.  I love this dryer!  I didn&#x27;t purchase this dryer on Amazon - rather ironic as I purchase so much from Amazon. I purchased this dryer at my grocery store as my other dryer died out and I needed a dryer immediately.. But I then looked the dryer up on Amazon to make sure they carried it after discovering how much I loved it.  I have a daughter who will definitely want to share this...I very infrequently write a review but wanted to let others know what a great product this is as I have depended on other&#x27;s reviews in the past when deciding on a purchase. Go ahead and buy this - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
