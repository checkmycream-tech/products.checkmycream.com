      <li>(I use more a bit when it&#x27;s wavy).</li>
      <li>Besides using sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner, the minute I put this on my hair including the pure argan oil that I use as well, my hair was shiny and silk like and smelled really good!</li>

      <li>My hair looked great before I left the house, but curled in the humidity within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it makes your hair smell good throughut the day and leaves your hair soft</li>

      <li>I originally bought this product from Wal-Mart for under $4.00.  </li>
      <li>Okay, first, of course, you DO need to know the \\&quot;history\\&quot; of my hair, etc.</li>
      <li>This is a very inexpensive but very high quality item that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good leave in conditioner infused with keratin.</li>
      <li>I love this so much.</li>
      <li>really don&#x27;t think it gets any better than this.</li>
      <li>Full of water and alcohol.  </li>
      <li>the top cap is easy to use and is better than other pump bottles i have used</li>
      <li>Without this product, my hair has flyaways and just looks dry, even though it&#x27;s in extremely good condition.</li>

      <li>I received a sample in the mail and instantly fell in love with the results!</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weighed down, but easy to style and very smooth!  </li>
      <li>She has fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>With a little scrunching, the curls perked up and looked just as great as the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looked and felt so soft and healthy and has tamed and defined my curls.</li>
      <li>I recommend these to any one who wants to keep hair healthy while making it straight.</li>
      <li>It will be worth your time and money, believe me.</li>
      <li>Great at keeping frizz down even without hot weather.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, and I add it to complete and Amazon order to get free super saver shipping since I can always use another bottle!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable and keeps it from becoming frizzy.  </li>
      <li>After not being able to find at Walgreens  or Wal-Mart or Dollar General (which I have found at each one)</li>
      <li>My hair is full of bounce, and there is now a very defined curl - not haystack frizz.</li>
      <li>you~~this is pure gold for any type of hair!</li>
      <li>I was excited about such a cheap heat protectant, but I don&#x27;t like it</li>
      <li>slept on my hair (as you do), and the next morning, I added a bit more conditioner and spritzed my hair with some water.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was on sale at my grocery store for like $2 when the line first launched</li>
      <li>Works really really well!</li>
      <li>Perfumey smell, too much!</li>
      <li>The first time I bought this from Amazon, I had to buy a package of three bottles.</li>
      <li>But, at the same time, I have yet to find a product that HAS been able to do this for me.  </li>
      <li>importantly, my hair has NEVER been this soft, even when it was at</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m mixed and have mixed-texture curly hair.  I use this before I blow dry and straight iron my hair and it definitely keeps my hair from looking frizzy and fried.  I also use it when I leave my hair curly.  It makes my hair soft and manageable and keeps it from becoming frizzy.  My favorite part about this product is the price.</li>
    <li> I rediscovered this product a few years ago. I used to use it religiously through high school, college, and marriage--ever since 1960, when it was just called Suave. It seemed to disappear for several years, but now it&#x27;s back. There is nothing better for my fine, flyaway, prone to break hair. Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you~~this is pure gold for any type of hair!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and use it EVERYDAY day. My hair is very dry, even using conditioner. I put this in my hair before I comb it out because it&#x27;s usually knotted. This stuff makes my hair manageable and silky smooth! Also helps with the frizz (I have frizzy/curly hair). I swear by this stuff!</li>
    <li> I had wanted this for a while and I finally broke down and bought it. I was hoping that it would really help my dry and frizzy relaxed hair. I use it both when my hair is wet or dry. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help add any type of moisture in my hair but it does smooth it alot, especially when I use it with another olive oil moisturizer, it makes my newly touched up hair look like it&#x27;s been straightened. I haven&#x27;t noticed any sort of heat damage although I haven&#x27;t tried to straighten my hair with it. I&#x27;ve been deep-conditioning my hair with a hair dryer and after I wash out the conditioner, brush this into my hair. I love this so much. I would totally recommend it to other relaxed girls but would add that you shouldn&#x27;t count on this to be your main moisturizer. But you should get great results if you use it with something else.</li>
    <li> This is great for getting the tangles out of my daughters long hair. She washes it at night. I put this in before it dries. The next day no tangles. She has fine straight hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I have dry hair due to excessive heat where i live and hair loss because of my thyroid condition. Besides using sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner, the minute I put this on my hair including the pure argan oil that I use as well, my hair was shiny and silk like and smelled really good! It looked and felt so soft and healthy and has tamed and defined my curls. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I stop putting permanent relaxers in my hair and allow it to grow natural, which is curly. It is also naturally dry. I have tried several moisturizers of which some were too vicous, pulling the curls straight and others were too light, kinking the curls. This leave-in conditioner wraps around the curvature of each curl, detangling my hair and making  manageable moist bouncing curls. Suave is defined by this product,  my hair is now smooth and elegant.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed when it came up on my sale search.  Besides being leave-in, the scent is nice and subtle.  One big plus is that it does NOT smell like coconuts.  I want a scent which does not clash with or overpower other products I use.  The biggest plus is how soft my dry hair feels.  I also like that it is on auto-ship so I can determine how often I want to get it.  It is not available in the stores where I have searched.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair is very blah normally. If I use conditioner it&#x27;s too weighed down, if I don&#x27;t, frizz central. I use this on my ends and it balances out perfectly. Not weighed down and not bozo hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> Such a great smell. Helps control the friz.</li>
    <li> Works really really well!</li>
    <li> does the job keeps my hair hydrated after showering! the top cap is easy to use and is better than other pump bottles i have used</li>
    <li> I hate my hair! LOL. Okay, first, of course, you DO need to know the \\&quot;history\\&quot; of my hair, etc. As a kid, I had perfectly straight, thick beautiful hair.  Maybe it&#x27;s all the damage I&#x27;ve done \\&quot;experimenting\\&quot; with different colors/stylers over the past two decades or the fact that I&#x27;ve gotten older/aging (or both), but I&#x27;m now in my late 30&#x27;s and have very fine, dry, wavey/frizzy hair.  My hair is HARD to style because it&#x27;s so \\&quot;kinky\\&quot; &amp; frizzy.  It&#x27;s very difficult to blow-dry straight &amp; I usually use flat iron to get the frizzes out.  If I do nothing, I look like a \\&quot;frizz-head\\&quot; and have \\&quot;kinks\\&quot; in my hair.  People actually think I have had my hair in a braid all day and just took it out (that&#x27;s how frizzy/kinky-looking it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied Suave Keratin Leave-In Conditioner while my hair was still damp and it instantly moisturized it, making de-tangling it with a comb EASY as pie.  I needed VERY little on my shoulder length hair (about the size of a nickle).  I put it in my hand, rubbed my hands together and then rubbed my hands through my hair (with extra attention near the ends, of course).  My hair was immediately silkier, softer and it eliminated all my tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It states you can use it on wet or dry hair, so I also tried it when my hair was dry.  Again, it instantly made my hair look healthier, feel softer, helped make some of my frizzies invisible and made it MUCH smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars instead of five ONLY because it didn&#x27;t completely get rid of ALL the frizziness in my hair (not even in a certain part of it) and it was still kinky and frizzy.  But, at the same time, I have yet to find a product that HAS been able to do this for me.  I could definitely see it helping someone with \\&quot;normal frizzies\\&quot; (instead of \\&quot;overdosed kinky frizzies\\&quot; like I have).  Perhaps their Keratin kit would help my hair since it&#x27;s so bad (but I&#x27;m not sure and have yet to consider trying it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have dry hair, I HAVE tried NUMEROUS different leave-in conditioners.  This one is definitely a favorite.  It helped make my hair look and feel softer, healthier and smoother instantly on it&#x27;s own.  When I applied it before styling my hair with my flat iron, it DID help make styling it and de-frizzing it with the iron faster and easier (and it eased my mind knowing I had a heat defense product in my hair while using such a hot styling tool on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be a great product that I WOULD recommend and buy again.ifferent leave-in conditioners.

    <li> Makes my hair feel sticky when I use it. I was excited about such a cheap heat protectant, but I don&#x27;t like it and I will probably just throw it away.</li>
    <li> my daughter has thin, easily tangled hair. This product works like magic untangling her hair ( with little to no puling/tears). I ssmells great, and with a small amount, my daughter can acually brush through the tangles herself without the brush looking like a small dog afterward</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m clearly a failure as a woman. I never heard of leave-in conditioner. It wasn&#x27;t until doing research for my honeymoon that I discovered it. This stuff is amazing. It took my damp, sun damaged, ocean damaged and pool damaged hair and returned it to normal every evening. I&#x27;m pretty sure one of the ingredients is magic.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, and I add it to complete and Amazon order to get free super saver shipping since I can always use another bottle! Great at keeping frizz down even without hot weather. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores. Glad I found it here. Will need more soon.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling sort of greasy so i only use it when im going curly. If i am going to straighten my hair i will use something else.</li>
    <li> My hair is uncolored/unprocessed, and I had been driving an hour to a salon for a great cut every 6-8 weeks. In between, I needed to use four different products to &amp;#34;maintain&amp;#34; my style; one in the shower, one before blow drying, one before using the flat iron, and one to hold it all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it never mattered, because by the time I got to work, my hair curled up, frizzed out, and did its own thing. I have tried a number of salon products, as well as Suave products with the same results, and was about to give up and admit defeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this on Amazon and figured I&#x27;d try it out. It has been nothing short of a hair turnaround for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I tried only a small amount, according to the guidelines. I used it before blow drying and couldn&#x27;t tell much difference. My hair looked great before I left the house, but curled in the humidity within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I dried my hair and then just went overboard on the conditioner. I really worked it in to my hair. I used a whole lot of conditioner and when I was finished, my head was covered in perfectly defined spiral curls. It looked the same when I got to the office. Throughout the day, I checked and it still looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slept on my hair (as you do), and the next morning, I added a bit more conditioner and spritzed my hair with some water. With a little scrunching, the curls perked up and looked just as great as the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never looked healthier (apart from the days I&#x27;d gotten it cut). It seems to DRINK this conditioner. When I use a whole lot, my hair feels the same as when you&#x27;d use styling mud, but not as dragged down. When I use a medium amount, my hair just feels soft. My hair is full of bounce, and there is now a very defined curl - not haystack frizz.</li>
    <li> Conditioner did nothing for my hair.  Cheap garbage. Full of water and alcohol.  Very small bottle. I guess a sucker is born every day.</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive but very high quality item that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good leave in conditioner infused with keratin. Does not leave hair greasy or with additional residue, my hair loves it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have EVER had so many people comment on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I leaves my hair so exceptionally color enhanced that I love looking at my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dress agrees, I gave her a little credit because of the colors that she put on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keratin, is just something that my hair was laking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your hair looks good it make you feel alive and ready to conquer the world.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and it does the job.  Perfect consistency to tame my thick, wavy hair.  I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I want to preface my impending praise by giving a little info on my hair. It&#x27;s relevant, I promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is bleached to a platinum blonde, and dyed even further to tone out all pigment. It&#x27;s blow-dried at least twice a week, and naturally curly. So basically, my hair is a nightmare for keeping under control. It&#x27;s dry, frizzy, my curls are messy and prone to tangling. You can imagine how much trouble I have keeping it looking and feeling nice, and much less being manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually stick with my higher end (and higher price tag) products, but I got fed up with slathering 4 different kinds of crap on my head in order to make it look halfway decent. Everything I tried just didn&#x27;t cut it until I tried THIS STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was on sale at my grocery store for like $2 when the line first launched and I figured for that cheap why not try it? I&#x27;ve never looked back guys, it&#x27;s amazing! It feels like I&#x27;ve had a fresh haircut all the time despite not having had one for the last 4 months. My curls are perfectly put together now, and the ends are neat without a hint of frizz. It honestly looks like I spent a long time curling my hair with an iron instead of towel drying and a little squirt of this. I haven&#x27;t had a single tangle since I&#x27;ve been using it either, and I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers though my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, my hair has NEVER been this soft, even when it was at it&#x27;s healthiest with zero dye and never having been touched by any heat tools, and the shine this baby give you is incredible! Anyone whose ever had bleached hair knows how hard it is to get the shine back in your hair. Even celebrities and models often have un-reflective and dull looking hair when it&#x27;s bleached or dyed super light, even in the sun it doesn&#x27;t look shiny. Not so with this. My hair shines like freaking diamonds now! That&#x27;s insane, my hair has never been shiny like this in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t think it gets any better than this. Ifit had this much impact on MY hair, as difficult as it is to make look good, it will work on ANYONE. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. With the price and the effectiveness, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Leaves a slight residue and does not protect against frizz and reversion at all. Maybe I had too high hopes being in Georgia, not much can protect from this level of humidity and heat. I&#x27;ve used this on myself as well as several clients with different hair textures, it did not give the silky feeling that I was hoping for, a bit too heavy, even when used very sparingly on course/natural hair.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this from Amazon, I had to buy a package of three bottles. They lasted so long I was actually getting fed up with looking at the extra bottles in the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll spare you the horror story of my curly, tangled, puffy hair. Be glad I&#x27;m not doing a video review, LOL! Suffice to say that I condition every time I wash and still can not get a comb through my hair without something extra. This stuff worked great without making my hair look greasy and made it pain-free to comb my hair. I took it for granted by the time I was on the third bottle and didn&#x27;t re-order. I switched back to something I could find locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a mistake! In order to get the comb through my hair with the other stuff I had to put so much on that my hair looked clumpy-shiny. That wasn&#x27;t the worst part though - the worst part was the way the clear oily-waxy stuff felt on my hands and fingers. I&#x27;d used it for years prior to the Suave and it never bothered me, but I got used to the creamy feel of the Suave and there is no comparison. The Suave feels like a light lotion on your fingers and the the clear frizz-fighting products that I was using before feel disgusting to me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I learned my lesson and I now have the Suave coming to me on subscribe and save. Luckily, Amazon sells it by the single bottle now. I strongly recommend this to anyone who has hard to handle hair or a tender head and to anyone who uses any of the clear stuff. If you like it, learn from my mistake and don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> It is a great leave in conditioner. Helped Smooth shaft and makes a great moisturizer on dry curly hair. Keeps hair manageable</li>
    <li> ~&lt;br /&gt;I have 33&amp;#34; long thick hair (which I plan on cutting off 4 to 6&amp;#34; soon). It&#x27;s a *itch trying to comb through with a wet brush when it&#x27;s still wet but sometimes I have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this but honestly didn&#x27;t think it would be any different than all the many other products I&#x27;ve wasted money on, at least this was very inexpensive compared to the rest I passed on to someone else or threw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But IT WORKS!!! I can hardly believe how well it works &amp; for such a great price too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now on my Amazon subscription to make sure I don&#x27;t run out of these little miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing... it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel ikkie, oily or heavier!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have the shampoo, conditioner and the leave in conditioner.  I recommend these to any one who wants to keep hair healthy while making it straight.</li>
    <li> it makes your hair smell good throughut the day and leaves your hair soft&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Buy it</li>
    <li> Perfumey smell, too much!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I have very fine hair so most products leave my hair looking and feeling greasy and even more flat. I received a sample in the mail and instantly fell in love with the results! After rubbing in just a small dot and blow drying and straightening my hair, my hair looked so good! It was so shiny and had more volume. I can&#x27;t find this product in stores though so tg for amazon!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair shine but it smells sort of manly and is a bit sticky for my taste.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Heat Defense Leave-In Conditioner is the best haircare product I have ever used. It smoothes frizz &amp; split ends, de-tangles &amp; conditions my long hair so well that I haven&#x27;t even needed to cut it in almost one year, and I was going to cut it short because of the bad condition it was in before finding this great product. It feels and smells great too and because there is no residue I can go longer in between washings which helps my hair stay healthier. My friends have also complimented on how great my hair looks. This product has definitely solved all of my haircare needs and problems. Suave has a winner with this one!</li>
    <li> This product is great and I use it along with my regular shampoo and conditioner. This not only calms down my naturally semi-curly hair, it makes my natural curls look great! Also, if I want to style my hair, I just add this and it holds. Best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve had</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel but its $2.88 at Walmart so I believe that this vendor is very overpriced.</li>
    <li> So I want to start out by saying, that I don&#x27;t normally use products that aren&#x27;t of a designer brand. But Suave seems to be getting better and better with every product they put out. I bought the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Heat Defense leave-in conditioner from Wal-Mart, I want to say it was arouns Christmas time I believe. So the product itself has lasted me for about five months with continuous use (I use it after every shower and combing). So I realized I was running low, and was hoping that I would have enough time to order the product before I completely ran out. I did-- I ordered it yesterday and received it today. Unbelievably fast. Without this product, my hair has flyaways and just looks dry, even though it&#x27;s in extremely good condition. It might be due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t had a trim in a few months, and I am in the process of growing my hair out, so it really needs to be shaped somewhat. My hair is a little past shoulder length, and has naturally spirally ringlet/waves (thing Katherine Pierce on The Vampire Diaries). Between taking my vitamins (primarily Biotin) and using sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, plus a Unite deep conditioner once a week, my hair is in amazing condition and has incredible shine to it. So I definitely would recommend this product. It will be worth your time and money, believe me.</li>
    <li> Well, firstly, it smells great so that is nice. My hair is so poofy that I have gone through product after product trying to get it to be shiny and smooth yet still touchable - I don&#x27;t want to have sticky, hard, gritty, nasty hair that I can&#x27;t touch, which is what you get from most products. This stuff keeps my hair from frizzing out yet doesn&#x27;t do any of the above. I use it both when I straighten my hair and when I wear it wavy (I use more a bit when it&#x27;s wavy). My hairdresser said to be careful using protein products every day, that it can make your hair brittle, but I think my hair must be pretty weak because I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all. On the contrary, my hair feels better than ever since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product from Wal-Mart for under $4.00.  I am 50yrs old,  long blonde color treated hair, blow dry and curl or flat iron daily. This product has surpassed anything I have tried. After not being able to find at Walgreens  or Wal-Mart or Dollar General (which I have found at each one) I ordered from Amazon for about $5.00. And $4.98 shipping,i found at  Wal-Mart again for 2.88. I normally will just change products.  But as soft and shiny as it leaves my hair it was worth the runaround. The ONLY thing that tames my flyaway.  It is not greasy and does not flatten your style</li>
    <li> THE MOST AMAZING PRODUCT! hair has never looked healthier!! I am not a big fan of leave-ins because sometimes they leave a gross residue but this one is uhh-mazing….my hair is shiny and bouncy and smells great!!!</li>
    <li> LIght on my hair, smells great, works great.  It doesn&#x27;t erase frizz completely (no product can ever do that), but my hair feels soft and looks shiny and smooth after using this product (and I only needed less than a dime-size for my medium-length thick/coarse/frizzy hair).  If you use in combo with the Suave keratin shampoo &amp; conditioner then you may never use another product line again!&lt;br /&gt;Low price, but expensive-looking results!</li>
    <li> My hair is darker, the greys don&#x27;t who so much and it holds a girl and shines like when I was younger. I really love this product and you&lt;br /&gt;can rub it through your hair and dry it with no heat damage.  I will order again when I use up this bottom.</li>
    <li> When I used this product along with the conditioner and shampoo, i don&#x27;t see much of a difference with my hair. Now, I can&#x27;t vouch for anyone else, but me myself see no difference.</li>
    <li> Super duper, works great!</li>
    <li> This is probably the BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can use this and not need a conditioner.  My hair is so much more manageable, smooth and softer too.  I have thick color treated hair that tends to get very frizzy with the least amount of humidity and was thrilled by how well this product worked.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weighed down, but easy to style and very smooth!  I also purchased the leave in conditioner for times when my hair is very dry...been swimming or high heat, and recommend that also.  These are my new favorites and will be for a long time!</li>
