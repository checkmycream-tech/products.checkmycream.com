<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Color was a little too light for my light brown complexion. It goes on really smooth, leaves a nice finish on your skin. I may try this product again in a darker color. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s products are great. Make sure you try ANY of their mascaras, people always think my lashes are fake.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect but I can say that I love this product!!It gave my skin a dewey finish and made my skin look so young &amp; refreshing. Once I applied my Bare Minerals \\&quot;warmth\\&quot;, my face was picture perfect!! Love this product!!</li>
    <li> the photo shows pink actual color of product is a brown.. so inadvertently ordered I think the wrong shade.. walgreens used to sell just two a pink and a green so I thought for sure this was the right pink..</li>
    <li> always need primer especially under eyes as have dark circles and crepey undereye skin and makeup tends to look heavy and cake... this primer dabbed on under eye area makes makeup go on smooth and does not crease or move all day...  also illuminates eye area ... many people have noticed... more youthful eye area and fresh glow.... so inexpensive of a product with an amazing result!!!</li>
    <li> I read that this is a product Beyonce uses to give her face that nice glow! Can it possibly work for me, a 50+ granny? I have to say, I love this stuff.  It is not a foundation however I use it both as a base and alone (without foundation).</li>
    <li> I did not like this product I don&#x27;t know if I picked the wrong color but it was a waist of money. The correcting primer is very.... how do I put it imagine putting some cream in your hand and adding so much water that it has a consistency creamy water. I am not sure if I explained my self correctly. My only advice would be go and try it at a local drug store to see if you like it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better green primers I&#x27;ve used.  I have moderate rosacea and I&#x27;ve tried many many green concealers.  I like the way this one spreads out on your skin, it&#x27;s got a nice texture and goes on even.  Perhaps those who got \\&quot;HULK face\\&quot; were not familiar with a primer.  I do things in this order: Moisturizer (wait 5 min), this green primer, foundation, then powder.  Done this way it gives me back my natural color and really tamps down the red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However:  Do not EVER get it on clothes because it is NEVER coming out!  I learned this the hard way.</li>
    <li> great product and not expensive, blends well.well worth any lady trying, you will like the results,be sure of your color it is easy to get to dark a color, so be careful,best is light/med.</li>
    <li> I liked it at first because the first pumps didn&#x27;t contain much glittery shimmer, but after a few uses it started to contain a lot of shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The color is beautiful and perfect for warming up the skin, but the overall shimmery look just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I will be giving this away.&lt;br /&gt;The green version contains not only less shimmer, but a finer-milled shimmer.  I wish that less was used in this product, then I would love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m soooooooo happy i decided to take advantage of this product. I got it for an awesome price and it arrived super quick. Product was exactly as described and worked how i needed. I will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> love this product. goes on smoothly and I put BB cream and bronzing gel over it and they all work well togehter.</li>
    <li> This product does a pretty good job. I&#x27;m using the peach one for dark spots and it does ok. I&#x27;m still working to get the hang of it, but it seems like it will do the job once I do.</li>
    <li> it made my breaking out worse but i have been breaking out for a week now anyways. when my skin was more clear it was too greasy for me to use regularly but its nice to use occasionally over yellow or green corrector sticks to blur out any scars or imperfections. its great to use when i need to cover up a tattoo on my arm for job interviews.its long wearing and its a nice veil for over skin correctors.</li>
    <li> It looks like people either love or hate this product.  I put this on my cheekbones and forehead and around my mouth. it instantly gives life to my dull skin (nc35) and the tiny shimmer particles look soft and pretty and not too shiny. I LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for undereye dark circles. I apply my concealer first and then dab this on under my eyes and then set it with a powder. The orangy color really does help to camouflage the dark circles. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> The orange pigment completely neutralizes my dark circles to the point where I can use tinted lotion to completely mask my hereditary dark circles!!!  I can remember buying at least 26 different primers + concealers in an effort to mask my dark circles. They never worked on me because as an Indian, my dark circles needed a peachy-ORANGE corrector. I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found something so simple that works!</li>
    <li> I got the orange to help correct some of my dark spots but the only thing it did was add shimmer to my face :(</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 at that price because i cant find them anywhere. Wayy too watery for a primer but does do an ok job for my dark discoloration around my mouth. They do have some sshimmerin them also.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Sadly, I cant seem to find it in stores anymore... was this discontinued? In any case, im glad I found it here and ive ordered a few of them to last me a while. I don&#x27;t like the feel of foundation or even powder so when I found this product, I immediately fell in love. Ive tried many tinted moisturizers and bb creams but haven&#x27;t really been too impressed yet. This is definitely my favorite. It is really light and has great coverage, even though its only supposed to be a primer, I don&#x27;t wear anything else! Its that great! My skin is not perfect, I do have some acne scars and uneven color spots but this makes my skin look luminous and even toned.  I am Hispanic with medium brown skin and this blends in perfectly. It does state that its for medium to deep skin to keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> Helps cover the dark spots of African American skin. Don&#x27;t let the bright pink color scare you.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it provides a natural glow. I use it as a primer and highlighter while contouring. Sometimes I only wear it, put a little lipstick on and am done in the morning. I have sensitive skin and am thankful to find a product that doesn&#x27;t break me out or exacerbate my eczema.</li>
    <li> I applied the orange primer underneath my Garnier BB cream and it worked well. However, I don&#x27;t think much of a difference was attained and I did not like the shimmer that was a part of the product. Also, the packaging wasn&#x27;t too great. Mine came wrapped in a sheet of bubble wrap with a split of cardboard. Tacky. Other than that, decent product. I could have passed up on it.</li>
    <li> Very watery, runny, ORANGE &amp; nasty... Nothing like anything I&#x27;ve EVER had from L&#x27;Oreal... Didn&#x27;t wanna put it on my face</li>
    <li> im an early 30s, AA woman with chocolate brown skin. I have hyperpigmentation on my forehead and jawline. i was looking for a product that i could apply and blend well and that would look ok under my foundation. unfortunately this product didnt blend well and didnt cover a good percentage of my trouble spots...on a positive note, it did give my skin a brighter look.</li>
    <li> it was ok for keeping the makeup in place,but its oily and i already have oily skin so it didnt work for me</li>
    <li> I really needed a color corrector and this one isn&#x27;t worth the hype. It actually burns when I apply it but I have seen some really good reviews on it on youtube. As far as a primer, I guess its okay but for color correction its not so good. I also tried to mix a little with my concealer to see it that would work but no, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Very red and liquidy doesn&#x27;t really work as a primer because it&#x27;s so dark that it shows thro any foundation. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you have dry skin.  However I would NOT recommend this for someone who has acne/oily prone skin.  Because it is suppose to brighten the skin, it has little specks of shimmer in it.  And I must admit it does brighten for a little while but after that my skin just become greasy looking.  Not even oily just plain greasy and gross!  Lol.  I love to use this product on people who have dry skin (their makeup ends up looking amazing) but I would NEVER use it on acne/oily prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have no clue why I purchase this when I say it made my face look ORANGE oh wow either I brought the wrong color, but this one was not a good match for me.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, as a primer, to correct weak guess.</li>
    <li> Not for all over face like I wanted to use it. But I use it as a blush and it looks very nice. Gives a lil plump to the cheeks.</li>
    <li> This product absolutely does the job. I am so happy with my purchase. It is not a concealer to cover redness or dark circles. Needs to be applied before foundation and just a small amount will be enough.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my skin brings out a glow from within ..love it bought several so I don&#x27;t run out ..great for he smmer here inn Vegas..its light and all I need is mascara and some lipstick and I&#x27;m out the door...Great service and seller wiillbuy more. As long as seller carries them...thanks</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would. Maybe better for someone with a lighter tone</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for...covers under eye circles nicely.</li>
    <li> Received on time. Product contains shimmer. If applied VERY sparingly, it will blend out sheer. A little goes a long way. Very &amp;#34;liquid-y&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> usually products are too light for my olive skin, but this was actually a bit too dark. nice and thin fluid--doesn&#x27;t cake under makeup.</li>
    <li> You will love this product.  Evens out your tone prior to applying makeup. Gives you a younger freash look even with out makeup.</li>
    <li> Uhh, really not sure what to use this for! Maybe some one can help. I tried it as a primer, but its wayyy too greasy!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Professional Color Correcting Anti-Dull.  The correction was very nice and blended well with my foundation.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected, it&#x27;s more like primer, does not conceal or cover any spots.</li>
    <li> I have hereditary dark circles under my eyes, that only get worse during allergy season or when I&#x27;m not well. The peachy-orange color of this primer is a bit shocking, but it does help to brighten up the area for folks with brown-peachy-yellow skin. I suggest you apply with fingers or a sponge in SMALL amounts and build coverage as you need it.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to try this product for the longest! I must admit the price was the main factor in me getting it on amazon. The color correcting quality is exactly what a woman of color needs to help camouflage any dark marks in her complexion. I would recommend this product to any woman of color especially to help camouflage any and all discolorations that she may have! Also, the price is a bargain...considering in the department stores this item would be at least  $11 or $12 a container. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Its a good liquid primer. It darkened my skin a bit though and is more of an orange brown than I expected. The item does the job well just the color didn&#x27;t really match my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a more apricot color but its peach</li>
    <li> I use this to add some highlight under my eyes. I also love that fact that it has a touch of shimmer!</li>
    <li> too small but i like it</li>
    <li> Works for what I wanted it for.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD,IT GIVES A CLEAN FRESH LOOK TO FOUNDATION IT&#x27;S GOOD FOR OILY SKIN AND DOESN&#x27;T LOOK CAKEY. IT GOES ON LIKE A SILK SHEER FINISH,YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO USE MUCH, AN I TRIED  RUNNING WATER OVER IT.  IT DOESN&#x27;T COME OFF WITHOUT RUBBING IT OFF WITH A CLOTH OR TISSUE.(kind of like waterproof).I THINK THAT&#x27;S A PLUS, THIS IS A #1 GO TO PRODUCT FOR ME.I LIKE REVLON PRIMER ALSO.THE( L&#x27;OREAL PRODUCT MEDIUM/DEEP) DOES NOT LEAVE THOSE LINES AND CREASES LIKE SOME MAKEUP.IT&#x27;S WORTH TRYING ONCE (UNDER $5 WITH SHIPPING)</li>
    <li> The only thing that works for my dark under eye circles and shadow above my lip..it takes very little product and put it on first before you add foundation or concealer</li>
    <li> It definitely helps to cover the dark areas of the skin for me. It also is very liquidly which I didn&#x27;t expect. I thought it would be a thicker texture but it still does the job.</li>
    <li> Nice product for your skin even for darker skin tones a little goes a long way trust me and make sure you have makeup wadges to blend.</li>
    <li> This has cut my makeup time in half and has stopped me using too much Bobbi Brown corrector which used to crease on me. This cancels out discoloration on my chin and works wonders under the eyes....LOVE IT. Thanks to Destiny Godley on YouTube!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few years ago at the local CVS and loved it. I was very sad to find out when I needed to restock that they stopped selling it; and it was much to my surprise that Amazon did have this product. It is just perfect for my skin tone and if you want just a little coverage. I do not wear a lot of makeup so this product even though it is a primer is great.  It has this color to it that will make dull skin glow.</li>
    <li> Looks ashy on my skin tone :(</li>
    <li> This product does come out a little runny but when applied it makes the skin have an excellent golden glow. It does have a little glitter but its barely noticeable. It blurred my imperfections and made my skin even and smooth for applying makeup. This seller offers makeup at such a deep discount compared to other stores I&#x27;ll be purchasing from here often</li>
    <li> This does not really base my skin in anyway excepy for dying it Orange, I would not reccommend this to anyone other than an Oompa Loompa looking to add more orange to their skin tone.</li>
    <li> this product has a watered down base..&lt;br /&gt;It gave me the impression that it was going to make my skin smooth but it&lt;br /&gt;works good for a highlighter above the makeup.</li>
    <li> this is supposed to be the darkest color correcting shade, right? So why did i look like some one slapped the black off me?    fc07(dot)deviantart(dot)net/fs71/f/2014/065/6/7/tmp_black_revoked_by_hammydlammy_d5z1gk1_1_945_by_hammydlammy-d7967u5(dot)jpg</li>
    <li> This is a great primer especially if you want to have a glowy look. Does what it says - makes your skin look brighter and more even. This is also a nice color corrector because of it&#x27;s peachy/apricot/orange undertones. Very nice for hyper-pigmentation, acne scarring, PIH, etc. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my only primer though especially since I have combination/oily skin. This goes great on top of your base primer however. Very smooth application and blends fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great brightening anti dull primer with good color correcting properties!</li>
    <li> I got this in 2 days, awesome.  The package was just a plastic parcel bag with no foam or bubble wrap to keep the product safe so the clear cap was cracked and it was leaking a bit.  Other than that the product if smooth and very effective giving me an even color on my face.  Love that!  Just wish the packaging would have been a little more cushioned or bubble wrapped envelope.</li>
    <li> O R A N G E! O R A N G E! O R A N G E!</li>
    <li> I love this anti-dull skin primer I usually mix it with my foundation but it looks great even wearing it alone! One of the few drugstore products that actually does what it claims. would buy this over a high end brand any day</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it correctly even though I watched videos on this product and how to apply it but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype and It didn&#x27;t do at all what I purchased it for. Which was to hide my under-eye bags and dark circles.</li>
    <li> This work very good to cover up my dark spots on my skin. I do recommend this for women of color who has blemishes and dark spots like myself. Blends very well</li>
    <li> This stuff makes such a difference in the way your skin feels and looks almost enough to want you not to put on anything else on your face. It just makes your skin look flawless and glowing. I will always order more of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after I tried it from a friend. This one was TOO WATERY and almost felt like it expired or too old (even though it doesn&#x27;t indicate that it was expired on the bottle)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a peach concealer and this wa in the search results. It was only a few bucks so I bought it. I didn&#x27;t really know how to use it at first so I did some research. It&#x27;s a primer that has a little but of shimmer. I put it in my bare face on the areas where I&#x27;m going to highlight only (under my eyes, bridge of nose, forehead, and chin) then I apply my foundation and concealer and it really makes the highlighted areas pop without using a highlighting powder or concealer a few shade lighter. I use this product pretty much whenever I wear makeup and get perfect results every time!</li>
    <li> Product works good on women of color, it allows your makeup to go nicely and you can even wear it alone without makeup/foundation - love it!</li>
    <li> AWESOME LOVE IT MY MAKEUP IS ALWAYS FLAWLESS BUT THIS ADDS THAT PROFESSIONAL TOUCH TO IT LOVE IT LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Im no make up artist so I may be applying it wrong. I personally dont like it but It may be user error. It sits on top of my skin and doesnt absorb well, giving me a chalky appearance.</li>
    <li> product has a thin consistency which i didn&#x27;t  mind but was not very effective with covering hyper pigmentation. it also at times leave a whitish film that was impossible to blend with the foundation</li>
    <li> This peach allows for complete coverage and build a ability of the coverage.  It also completely covers the imperfections easily and with less effort.</li>
