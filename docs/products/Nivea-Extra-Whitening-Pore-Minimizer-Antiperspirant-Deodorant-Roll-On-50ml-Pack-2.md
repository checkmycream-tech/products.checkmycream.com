    <li> Works great! Smells good... just make sure to let it dry after putting it on.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years now and I love it! I am a dark skinned latina and have always hated my dark underarms. I stopped using all the medicated antiperspirant deodorants from stores because it would make them even darker. But I can honestly say you will see results. I see a drastic improvement. The bad thing is that it takes a long time to get in the mail so order before you run out!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make any difference. Not only that, I sweat more when I was wearimg it</li>
    <li> I have been looking for anything that can help whiten my underarms since some time now.based on the reviews bought this in July 2014 from Amazon.shipped from chennai,India.so takes awhile to get here.cant read its contents,because there is very little info on it &amp; that is in some south East Asian language.so,not sure about the chemicals in it. I reordered (the pack of 2)twice in one year so as to give it some time to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;Loved the fresh scent which I thought lasted for upto 6 hours. But too pricey compared to other products.&lt;br /&gt;After a year,I&#x27;ve stopped buying it,I&#x27;m 100% sure,it doesn&#x27;t work or atleast didn&#x27;t work for me!beware,&lt;br /&gt;Many products ( also some reviewers) do not work as they claim.try some inexpensive home remedy( Google it)like lime juice &amp; sodium bi carbonate for whitening &amp; a deo without harsh chemicals( try baby powder)for freshness.</li>
    <li> While it took almost a month for me to get the product. I am really happy with the results achieved thus far. This product does exactly what it says. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> love it! got two and gave my sister one and now she wants to order it as well. Worth the shipping and waiting time.</li>
    <li> Works great as antiperspirant nothing yet  on the whitening  I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks will continue to see if there is a change.</li>
    <li> this is great stuff I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I see a huge improvement</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very fast to get the product because it&#x27;s come early, plus it&#x27;s good product. I love it. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have beem using this deodorant for about two weeks and I see a big difference. I don&#x27;t see that horribla shadow under my arms anymore and I&#x27;m so much more confident now wearing tank tops!</li>
    <li> Ive been using it for a couple of months and i can see the change. My underarm skin is way lighter and it is a great anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> it worked good as a deodorant but it doesn&#x27;t do any lightning effect but I still like it 😄</li>
    <li> I live in Texas and it&#x27;s hot as you know what. I didn&#x27;t even get the product in the house. I was a little afraid to open it, because I didn&#x27;t realize I ordered something from overseas. (I guess I need to lay of the crime shows I watch) Once I convinced myself that the post office probably scanned it before delivery, I opened it, an envelope, not a box. The deodorant was pouring out of the packaging it was everywhere! What in the world! It went in the garbage outside. Totally unsavagable! Disgusted!</li>
    <li> It really works for me.i sweat a lot and it keeps me fresh all day I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Well, I got this product thinking of it can work and doesn&#x27;t give me itchiness because I have used a lot of deodorants but they didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m not a fan of Nivea products cuz it makes me itchy and that what happened when I used this deodorant. I bought two battles. The first one was OK but didn&#x27;t make underarm lighter!!! I was l like ok maybe I need to keep using it so I used the second bottle and things got worse. My underarm got darker than ever and it&#x27;s itching me all the time so I stopped using it. My skin is very sensitive and got irritated.</li>
    <li> I expected to receive this product to give me confidence and feel clean as well as fresh. This product did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;It was beyond my expectation.</li>
    <li> Been using this deodorant for 2 weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any whitening of my underarms but I absolutely LOVE the smell. I need to reapply during the day as I&#x27;ve noticed smell comeback, something that doesn&#x27;t happen with solid deodorants that I use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now I&#x27;m not really seeing difference,but imma be finishing off the last bottle not the its a different brand</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few months and I have not noticed any changes but as far as just a deodorant it works good.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the skin getting lighter yet, but it does keep me fresh all day..and it&#x27;s not as sticky as I thought it would be for a roll on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of roll on anything but I gave it a try, didn&#x27;t work good luck if you buy it</li>
    <li> IT worked before but not sure with it this time</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with the results. I didnt see any changes the time i used it. i used both bottles thinking it was going to work but it didnt.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I started using it about a year ago. I can really see a difference in my underarms. I would give it 5 stars but it takes a long time to receive it after ordering. I also love how it smells.</li>
