    <li> Very nice oil! And the shipment went without any problems!</li>
    <li> I love it...I use it plain, a little dab under my armpit or mix a drop with my Vetiver after shaving and what an infusion. Very masculine and very sexy. Excellent quality. People at Now, they know what they&#x27;re doing. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love it, I use it for scent as well as for aches and pains and invigoration.</li>
    <li> Now Foods has been my go to for essential oils for 15 years. They have never let me down. #1 with me.</li>
    <li> This smell is very intriguing.  I&#x27;d say its one of the only smells that&#x27;s feminine and masculine at the same time.  It is an earthy scent that is slightly floral.  It&#x27;s great for diffusing, and for adding to deodorants for a great scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Have used it before.</li>
    <li> Is as stated.  does it work?  I guess,  Just not for what I wanted it for.  I was just trying it.</li>
    <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my diffuser for several weeks and I&#x27;m loving it.  I grew up in the boonies and we had tons of juniper around the house so for me this is such a lovely home-y smell.  It&#x27;s not too astringent and mixed with some pine oil it smells like a New England forest.  Works very well with the Now Foods diffusers. I wish it were a bit more affordable, maybe closer to the other Now Foods oil price points, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a similar quality oil so this is my go-to for the time being.  Overall it&#x27;s a really lovely unique scent that works great as an air freshener.</li>
    <li> I used this in soap and the scent makes you feel like you&#x27;re sitting in a juniper grove.  It is powerful.  I used it with a woodsy green color and it has been very well received.</li>
    <li> This stuff is intense! Newbie to essential oils, I also have Now&#x27;s cypress, eucalyptus and cedar (which are all awesome) but this Juniper berry is the most potent one I have tried so far. Living in an apartment with 5 animals (6 if you include me) this oil running through my Aroma Ace (on low) will make the place smell like a forest, no joke! Next step is to start mixing the oils for a &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; fragrance but I have to say this bottle is going to last.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, good product</li>
    <li> Love this oil. This is one I use in many  blends</li>
    <li> Works great to reduce swelling in the ankles.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Good quality.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> Love it! Bought it to concoct my own bug deterrent oil blend. Works great :)!</li>
    <li> My wife loves these oils.  She uses them all of the time and believe they help with a variety of aches and pains.</li>
    <li> Now Foods essential oils are great products! They are very affordable quality oils.&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend Now Foods essential oils.</li>
    <li> This smells so fresh and wonderful! It&#x27;s kind of evergreen with a tiny touch of fruit notes. Also, incredible price for the amount.</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy, it will eat rubber. Strong this one is. Has a tree smell to it. Has a strong Juniper tree smell.</li>
    <li> With my new line of hair product, this oil is so good for your hair.</li>
    <li> This oil does not have the freshness I expected. It was sort of a disappointment, really, as were two other oils I purchased from this manufacturer.  This one is tolerable, but not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Smells good almost piney.</li>
    <li> Now has the best oils out there. Just make sure when buying you get 100% essential oils. Love the scent in my products.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it in my natural products.  It has nice scent. My last recipe was in a hair butter. Juniper is good for the scalp and promotes growth. So far, so good. I will have to get back to you on the benefits of this EO.</li>
