      <li>Va. When I could not find it in the area where I live, I went to Amazon and got a great deal.</li>
      <li>The light scent and smoothness of this product make it a favorite in our household.</li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasant and does not clash with other fragrances.    </li>
      <li>works great as a facial moisturizer too!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to find this on Amazon, it&#x27;s disappeared from the local stores ;( I&#x27;m hoping this is not another Neutrogena product that disappears.</li>
      <li>It is light and has a light scent.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is light weight, and because it&#x27;s so water soluble</li>
      <li>Never saw this before a business trip to Phoenix - grabbed the hotel sample bottle on the way to the office first morning and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>Light, fresh fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, so this is my go-to moisturizer when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>my skin never felt better after using it for nearly 10 yrs!  </li>
      <li>It is just as it says, a light lotion with a lovely fragrance...just enough!</li>
      <li>I liked it and looked locally but could not find it so went to Amazon.  </li>

      <li>I buy this great product on a continuous basis and I believe everyone who hasn&#x27;t, to at least try it!  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different types of lotion and this is the only one I use.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
      <li>This soothes it and lasts for hours, bringing just a light touch of sesame oil - enough to hydrate, but not enough to leave that oily feeling.  </li>
      <li>I first used this body lotion at a bed and breakfast in the upper peninsula of Michigan.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the body oil, but have found it a bit too heavy in warmer weather.  </li>
      <li>No one near me carries it.  </li>
      <li>and it goes quickly as the other girls in the office want to use it as well!</li>
      <li>These are definitely not good for you and a detrimental effect is made more likely by the fact that you end up using so much of this product.    </li>
      <li>I was given a sample of this lotion at a major Hotel in Williamsburg,</li>
      <li>It is wonderful...not greasy in the least, absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive overly dry skin that literally cracks open.  </li>

    <li> I love this lotion. It does not leave a greasy residue on my skin and it smells good.</li>
    <li> Though not mentioned on the actual bottle, this product contains parabens and butylated hydroxytoulene. These are definitely not good for you and a detrimental effect is made more likely by the fact that you end up using so much of this product.    [...]</li>
    <li> This lotion is light weight, and because it&#x27;s so water soluble it&#x27;s refreshing. Not Greasy! ...and it smells really nice too.  I Love it!</li>
    <li> love this stuff, use it all over my body.  works great as a facial moisturizer too!  good thing i bought the 4 pack!!</li>
    <li> I first used this body lotion at a bed and breakfast in the upper peninsula of Michigan.  I loved it and have been using it ever since.  It is wonderful...not greasy in the least, absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft. Light, fresh fragrance.  I keep it on my desk at work and it goes quickly as the other girls in the office want to use it as well!</li>
    <li> Never saw this before a business trip to Phoenix - grabbed the hotel sample bottle on the way to the office first morning and fell in love with it.  Got back home and - wham!  No one near me carries it.  I was heartbroken.... but Amazon saved the day!  Why would I hunt this down?  I have sensitive overly dry skin that literally cracks open.  This soothes it and lasts for hours, bringing just a light touch of sesame oil - enough to hydrate, but not enough to leave that oily feeling.  Minimal if any fragrance.  Just better than anything else I have tried. I am a convert - I have a pump at the office, one in the bedroom, one in the kitchen (and one in the linen closet to fill that little sample bottle to keep with me on the plane!).</li>

    <li> The light scent and smoothness of this product make it a favorite in our household. Doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky or tacky, nor does it bother allergies.</li>
    <li> I received samples of this marvelous body lotion, and now I&#x27;m hooked! I have extremely dry skin on my legs and feet, so moisturizing properties last for hours.  It absorbs quickly, so this is my go-to moisturizer when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  The scent is very pleasant and does not clash with other fragrances.    I&#x27;m a huge fan of the body oil, but have found it a bit too heavy in warmer weather.  The body lotion is the right product for moisturizing when the weather gets warmer.    I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product on this site a couple years ago and felt compelled to continue tell your audience that this product is 1st RATE!  I buy this great product on a continuous basis and I believe everyone who hasn&#x27;t, to at least try it!  It&#x27;s not expensive (THANKS to Amazon)and my skin never felt better after using it for nearly 10 yrs!  I beg Amazon to continue to sell this product as long as it&#x27;s made.  BUY IT, YOU won&#x27;t be disappointed!      Mike  Washington DC</li>

    <li> My wife was quite surprised when the 4-pack of lotion arrived - she didn&#x27;t know I had found, much less ordered them.</li>
    <li> I estimate I have been using this product for over 20 years and have not considered switching.  I have tried other hotel samples over the years and none have the \\&quot;light\\&quot; and non-greasy texture of this Netrogena product.</li>
    <li> I first used this as a guest sample at a hotel.  I liked it and looked locally but could not find it so went to Amazon.  Of course I found it and ordered it.  I am using my last bottle now and soon will need to reorder.  It really feels so light and amazing on my skin plus it feels great on my face.</li>
