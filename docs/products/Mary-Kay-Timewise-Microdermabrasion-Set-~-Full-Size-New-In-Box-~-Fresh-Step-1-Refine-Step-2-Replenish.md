    <li> Great product for rejuvenating skin, clearing up marks and fading scars! My face felt super soft and I didnt experience redness. Excellent product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Best exfoliating product I&#x27;ve ever had. Renewal cream is the perfect follow-up.</li>
    <li> I think it works quite well.  I bought it for the specific purpose it was intended- as a microdermabraser. I use it twice a week and it leaves my skin so soft and smooth, and better looking.</li>
    <li> swear by this stuff. I would have liked it to come in its original box instead of a small plastic bag.Otherwise the product it self is wonderfull.</li>
    <li> After just one use my skin was SO much smoother. I have really noticed an amazing difference in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture. My skin was really splotchy from years of tanning bed abuse but this has worked wonders on evening out my complexion and helping me to feel confident without layers of foundation for the first time in forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because the sender gypped me on postage so I had to pay the mail lady the difference.</li>
    <li> Everything was as advertised and delivered on time. Excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, as advertised</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Softens my skin and I just won&#x27;t do without.</li>
    <li> I really like how my skin feels after using this product.  It&#x27;s not too rough and the after lotion makes my skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> I use it every once in a while if I have dry skin. I love the moisturizer. It helps removes the dead skin off the surface but that&#x27;s about it for me. I have acne prone skin and it didn&#x27;t make my breakouts worse but it didn&#x27;t really make them better either. Good product but not the miracle worker I was anticipating.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even work instantly like everybody said. face is not softer. its like nothing happened. wasted my money on this product</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for a Christmas present, and a lot cheaper than going directly to someone for it.</li>
    <li> Works great on sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I LOVE Mary Kay Timewise Collection. It goes great with sensitive skin and I can really tell a difference in using the whole collection. Moving on to this product.... I LOVE the Microdermabrasion Set. Its a little pricey, but definitely worth it if you have dry area. I have very dry skin around my nostrils, but using this a couple times a week helps tremendously!</li>
    <li> Love it /shipped fast</li>
    <li> makes me my skin so dry after using this product</li>
    <li> Solo good! Love it...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and liked and decided to get it again.  It&#x27;s been a few years since I&#x27;ve used before and it still works just as great. I tend to break out for seems to be like no reason and this product keeps that in control and my face is smooth with minimum acne break outs.  However, I am not a fan of the vendor.  I paid extra to have the product to me in 2-3 days and the day the product was SUPPOSED to arrive was the day it was SENT out.  The Ruby Boutique vendor told me the money I paid to have it expressed shipped to me would be returned and 2 months later that has yet to happen.  I will purchase the product again but not from Ruby Boutique.  It says a lot about your business ethic when you clearly make a mistake and then say screw the customer because you my money.  I recommend the product, but I don&#x27;t recommend that you get it from Ruby Boutique who admits the error and then turns around and lies about trying to correct the error.</li>
    <li> Wow! For a much lower price than your local Mary Kay seller you get he same stuff! This seller provided the same exact product for a fraction the cost. The scrub works wonders in the first 2 -3weeks, but then you may need to wait 6-12 months because it can only do so much! Reduces the size of pours, clears skin, smooths wrinkles, but it seems when it is done, it&#x27;s done.It can only do so much. Magical results in the first months use but then loses quality...Highly recommend if it is your first use, after that use something else for a year.</li>
    <li> I love this set! It peels away damaged cells and leaves skin feeling smooth and flawless. With continual use, I noticed my skin looks brighter and younger! Love it!</li>
    <li> Exfoliates like nothing else! It&#x27;s a great product with the unexpected benefit of being a great makeup primer. It keeps my face from getting shiny mid day and hold my foundation on.</li>
    <li> Felt a differed right away. Easy on your skin. Quick delivery too. Thank you.</li>
