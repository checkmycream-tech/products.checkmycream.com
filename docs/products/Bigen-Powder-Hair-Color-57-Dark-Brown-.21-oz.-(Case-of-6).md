<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fake product,  do not buy. Product Not made in Japan, LICENSED in Japan! Save your money and buy something legit.</li>
    <li> Good wrapping,good product as usual always use do reccomend</li>
    <li> The hair color arrived shortly after it was ordered.  It was perfectly packed, and a bargain for the price. Great</li>
    <li> Received as advertised and quickly</li>
    <li> I love this Japanese hair dye because this does not contain ammonia and it works well. It needs to mix with tap water and it takes 30 min. to complete for hair dye. Also, its price is good. Thank you.</li>
    <li> No harsh chemical effect on my previous relexed hair. Covered all my grey, and looks natural. Make sure use the shampoo for colored hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Numerous reports from my family members sites this brand to cause slow but permanent hair loss. There were also some published studies.I returned the 12 boxes unopened and had to pay for return freight plus the worst seller on AMAZON charged me a 15% unpublished restocking fee. This makes me mad and will never ever buy from this seller again. He stinks.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding a color to cover my gray and still look natural without all the mess! This color is quick and easy!</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY PRODUCT. I&#x27;M ASKED REGULARLY WHAT I&#x27;M USING BUT TO DATE NOONE SEEMS TO GET IT. SOMEHOW THE CONCEPT OF A WATER BASED HAIR COLOR DOESN&#x27;T CLICK...</li>
    <li> I love this product.  very easy&lt;br /&gt;to use.  Very well priced.  I will  order this product again over any other hair dye.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and works well.</li>
    <li> So glad I discovered bigen hair colors. After switching from salon and the more expensive at home products to this my hair is so much healthier and doesn&#x27;t get any red fade as it used to.</li>
    <li> great product and price</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years I notice that my hair started to fall down not sure if its the die or just normal hair fall from getting old. Anyway, I love the fact this product doesnt have ammonia so peroxide is not necessary. if used properly the results are very natural.</li>
    <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp. However, after a couple weeks my grays showed up again. Bright side is that it&#x27;s so inexpensive, I could use 2 a month and it be great!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Easy to use and the color stays in and doesn&#x27;t fade.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is natural and no chemical .</li>
    <li> After reading many negative reviews, I was afraid to try it for weeks. I finally did (without doing a patch test) and it worked great. Since I read that many people have problems with the dye on their skin, I put the dye on a comb and combed it through my hair. I never massaged it into my scalp or anything. I even used the comb on my sideburns. I left it on for about 20 minutes and rinsed it off. I never felt itchy and never got any skin reaction. I&#x27;m glad because I had purchased 6 boxes. My wife said it colors much better than all the other Men&#x27;s hair dyes I&#x27;ve tried. And it&#x27;s the only one which covered my temples and hair near my neck on the back. All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with the product. I think I&#x27;ll continue to put the dye on a comb and dye my hair that way. I&#x27;ll review the product in a month and let you know if the color lasts longer than other dyes.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this.  Easy to apply and hair looks shiny after washing.  This is actually a re-order so you can see we like using it.</li>
    <li> This dye works well for me because I develop allergies from the other stronger dyes.  It helps that this has no ammonia no peroxide.</li>
    <li> It covers my gray great!  Not very messy!  No bad smells!  Follow the directions for best results!  Never going back!</li>
    <li> Love this product.the resulting color looks very natural.one bottle gives me 2-3 applications.Great scent.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. No mess. No long wait. Lasts longer than most permanent hair colors.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy to have received Bigen #57 Dark Brown Hair colouring powder.&lt;br /&gt;My father swears by it and he looks \\&quot;young\\&quot; because&lt;br /&gt;he colours his hair with BIGEN. He has used BIGEN for&lt;br /&gt;almost 5 years with no side effects or reaction.&lt;br /&gt;BIGEN is great hair colouring product and they have several shades.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Japanese product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend every one to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you AMAZON for introducing BIGEN.</li>
    <li> Wife has been using this for years......main reason......does NOT damage her hair. Holds color well for reasonable amount of time before needing to be done again.</li>
