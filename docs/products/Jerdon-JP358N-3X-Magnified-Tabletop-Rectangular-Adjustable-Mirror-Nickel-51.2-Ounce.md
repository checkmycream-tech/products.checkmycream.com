      <li>This is a great mirror.</li>
      <li>Great mirror surface, I purchased it for shaving.</li>

      <li>I will be buying more as gifts for my friends!</li>

      <li>I bought this for my wife after she liked using one in a hotel where we stayed.  </li>
      <li>I had this mirror in the room of one of my hotel stays, and had to have one of my own.  </li>
      <li>Cheaper version but nice.</li>
      <li>it is still a nice mirror.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad we found this at a good price.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless a nice addition to a womans bathroom</li>
      <li>First experienced this mirror at a Grand Hyatt hotel and thought it was a compact, sleek design for a counter top magnifying mirror.  </li>
      <li>One of those purchases I am glad I made.</li>
      <li>, it looks sleek and elegant</li>
      <li>Really looks great on my vanity.</li>
      <li>Glad I got it.</li>
      <li>Love the style and shape.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
      <li>and I said sure.</li>
      <li>Its streamlined shape makes it perfect for smaller bathroom vanities.  </li>
      <li>It does help when applying eyeliner or tweezing eyebrows, but the ultra zoom that some mirrors offer may be a more practical option.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m able to place that tricky waterproof eyeliner on with ease.  </li>
      <li>The 3X magnification mounted on this stand facilitate its placement almost anywhere and under most light conditions.</li>
      <li>Recommend it to anyone who wants a good shaving mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It allowed me to easily apply my make up without any mistakes.  </li>
      <li>The mirror size is fine but because chrome is used instead of glass the reflection is wavy.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and clean</li>
      <li>When my wife and I stayed at Marriott hotel, she found the mirror was very useful and cosmetically pleasing to look at.</li>
      <li>Quality stainless construction and stylish design.</li>
      <li>Take care of it and put it in a safe place without moving it too much.</li>
      <li>It was shipped fast and was packaged in a way that kept it safe.</li>
      <li>Not only is it an attractive addition to my modern bathroom, it&#x27;s function is</li>
      <li>The magnification is best at the center (the image from the corners naturally are warped)</li>
      <li>The mirror is fine but really doesn&#x27;t seem to give the magnification I thought it would.  </li>
      <li>It takes little space, can rotate as I need it, looks great, and does just what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>This one functioned the same but was not finished as nice as the one in the hotel.  </li>
      <li>The materials and quality construction make this mirror worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the right height, right magnification.</li>
      <li>First saw this at a hotel and liked the different shape.</li>
      <li>This looks like a much more expensive mirror that you will be happy to display on a vanity or in a guest room.</li>
      <li>I was delighted when I saw this one on Amazon for half the price of the hotel mirror.  </li>
      <li>I went with inexpensive, and so far it&#x27;s working out just fine for me.  </li>
      <li>and only 1/3 of the price of the hotel&#x27;s brand! - I intend to give one to my sister and sister-inlaw - What a great product - Still new, so I can&#x27;t say how long it will last, but I&#x27;m pleased now!</li>
      <li>I had to buy another because my first one broke.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was a higher magnified mirror.</li>
      <li>Exactly as represented.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sleek looking!</li>
      <li>the only thing is I wish the magnification was greater for make up use.</li>
      <li>but overall was finished better.</li>
      <li>I use this on my vanity next to a vase of flowers and it has a very clean and minimalistic look.</li>
      <li>But it really doesn&#x27;t magnify very much.</li>
      <li>I also like the sleek, modern design aspect as well.</li>
      <li>Does not magnify as much as the one I used at a hotel.  </li>
      <li>modern look and feel,</li>
      <li>on the enclosed instructions is the real danger of this mirror.  </li>
      <li>and she does not seem to care all that much as it does what she needs it to do.</li>
      <li>Be warned, looks attractive but poor quality product.</li>
      <li>so I use another older mirror instead.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Arrived safely packaged and in good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say use also with final check back with usual sized mirror, as sometimes seeing oneself in 3 x, we can miss minor finishing</li>
      <li>I have heavy wood blinds on my bathroom window but cannot be sure that some sunlight may not stream through during the day.</li>
      <li>Lighting action GOODx100000</li>
      <li>We came across this mirror at a classy hotel out west this summer</li>
      <li>right price, arrived quickly, and looks much better than all the other mirrors out there that are round and ordinary.</li>
      <li>I suppose if you just need a small mirror it would be fine, but I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
      <li>I only wear readers, so putting on makeup behind a pair of glasses was a challenge- LOVE IT!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great addition to the counter top in my bathroom.  I&#x27;m glad we found this at a good price.</li>
    <li> I used this mirror when I was vacationing at Secrets The Vine in Cancun.  I loved the added vision this mirror provided when I was applying my eye make up.  It allowed me to easily apply my make up without any mistakes.  I would recommend this mirror to everyone that finds the need to wear cheater glasses for close work.</li>
    <li> Love it. Really looks great on my vanity. I was recently in Boston and had this mirror in my bathroom, I flipped it around to see.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after she liked using one in a hotel where we stayed.  This one functioned the same but was not finished as nice as the one in the hotel.  I returned it because one of the corners was chipped.  I ended buying a more expensive mirror that looked similar but overall was finished better.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. Not only is it an attractive addition to my modern bathroom, it&#x27;s function is spot on. Whether you need it for finishing makeup touch ups, or removing unwanted hairs it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Lighting action GOODx100000</li>
    <li> this was very small and not at all what I expected.  Returned it.  I suppose if you just need a small mirror it would be fine, but I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sleek looking! Love the style and shape. I just wish it was a higher magnified mirror. Besides that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  It&#x27;s the right height, right magnification. right price, arrived quickly, and looks much better than all the other mirrors out there that are round and ordinary.</li>
    <li> I like it but I wish it had some sort of backlight</li>
    <li> It looks and feels the same as the one in the hotel that inspired me to buy it. But it really doesn&#x27;t magnify very much.</li>
    <li> I gave these as Christmas gifts to six of us over 60.  Even though we are all critical of what we can see, we CAN SEE ourselves!  And that is the point.  Its streamlined shape makes it perfect for smaller bathroom vanities.  It catches the light perfectly.</li>
    <li> First experienced this mirror at a Grand Hyatt hotel and thought it was a compact, sleek design for a counter top magnifying mirror.  Now that I&#x27;ve had the product for a couple of months, it&#x27;s proven to be a great addition to the bath that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.  Quality stainless construction and stylish design.</li>
    <li> This came on time. The size and quality of the mirror is excellent. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The mirror size is fine but because chrome is used instead of glass the reflection is wavy.  That is not great for makeup.  A big problem not mentioned in the sale information but on the enclosed instructions is the real danger of this mirror.  It has to be set up where sunlight through the window will not reflect on the chrome.  It can act as a magnate and cause a fire.  That may work in a makeup area without windows.  I have heavy wood blinds on my bathroom window but cannot be sure that some sunlight may not stream through during the day. Because of that I would have to cover the mirror with a towel when not in use. This fire danger is a big issue for me so I use another older mirror instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d seen these in hotel bathrooms and had been coveting them for awhile.  I was delighted when I saw this one on Amazon for half the price of the hotel mirror.  The quality seems to be as good as the ones in hotels.</li>
    <li> This is the best magnifying mirror I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is so well-designed.  It sits firmly on its base and yet the mirror face can be easily adjusted to myriad positions.  Those of us in the over-50 crowd will appreciate how the mirror enables one to actually see the little nubby whiskers that one can usually only feel.  The materials and quality construction make this mirror worth every penny.  I expect to never have to replace it.</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine but really doesn&#x27;t seem to give the magnification I thought it would.  Does the job though.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy a similar mirror for $97 and at checkout an offer appeared with this one for just under $40. Same height, style and function as the more expensive one. I&#x27;m delighted with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Does not magnify as much as the one I used at a hotel.  Cheaper version but nice.</li>
    <li> Well priced and perfect size. I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Nice modern look and feel, well built.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone.</li>
    <li> First saw this at a hotel and liked the different shape. Works well on my vanity for applying makeup. Takes up very little space with enough magnification for my needs</li>
    <li> Other shaving mirrors are either too small, too flimsy or too whatever. This mirror is a dream to shave with. the 3X magnification makes it easy to see what you are shaving instead of taking your best shot at it. Used one of these in a hotel in Aruba in 2006 and always thought about buying one. .. Finally did it. One of those purchases I am glad I made. Recommend it to anyone who wants a good shaving mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Pag</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful vanity mirror that is a work of art. While vanity mirrors with different zoom sides and lights are more practical, they are often bulky and ugly when on display. I use this on my vanity next to a vase of flowers and it has a very clean and minimalistic look. It does help when applying eyeliner or tweezing eyebrows, but the ultra zoom that some mirrors offer may be a more practical option. This looks like a much more expensive mirror that you will be happy to display on a vanity or in a guest room.</li>
    <li> We came across this mirror at a classy hotel out west this summer and I was determined to find one like it.  This is perfect!  It takes little space, can rotate as I need it, looks great, and does just what it is supposed to do.  Love it!</li>
    <li> When my wife and I stayed at Marriott hotel, she found the mirror was very useful and cosmetically pleasing to look at. So she asks, “can you order me one when you get a chance?” and I said sure. When Marriott e-mail showing sale, I searched the mirror and I could not believe how expensive it was for such a small mirror. With tax and shipping, it was over $130 dollars and I could not justify the price. Searched Amazon and found 95% resemblance item for less than a half the price. Wife uses it daily and she does not seem to care all that much as it does what she needs it to do. If you are searching for the same mirror from Marriot hotel, get this item.</li>
    <li> Be warned, looks attractive but poor quality product.</li>
    <li> Great mirror surface, I purchased it for shaving. A bit short for this purpose when it&#x27;s sitting on the counter... but works.</li>
    <li> The 3X magnification mounted on this stand facilitate its placement almost anywhere and under most light conditions. Very highly satisfied with it!!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  The magnification is best at the center (the image from the corners naturally are warped) and I&#x27;m able to place that tricky waterproof eyeliner on with ease.  I also like the sleek, modern design aspect as well.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, large mirror excellent for makeup application. Just as found in 5 star hotels. Arrived safely packaged and in good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say use also with final check back with usual sized mirror, as sometimes seeing oneself in 3 x, we can miss minor finishing touches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect for me and my vanity thank you!</li>
    <li> I had used one like this in a hotel and was amazed at how well I was able to see to do my makeup!  I had tried other magnifying mirrors for the bathroom counter, but they didn&#x27;t give the same clarity or ease of use - This thing is GREAT!! I only wear readers, so putting on makeup behind a pair of glasses was a challenge- LOVE IT! and only 1/3 of the price of the hotel&#x27;s brand! - I intend to give one to my sister and sister-inlaw - What a great product - Still new, so I can&#x27;t say how long it will last, but I&#x27;m pleased now!</li>
    <li> I had to buy another because my first one broke. Take care of it and put it in a safe place without moving it too much.</li>
    <li> I had this mirror in the room of one of my hotel stays, and had to have one of my own.  There was a wide price range for something that looked to be identical.  I went with inexpensive, and so far it&#x27;s working out just fine for me.  Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected. I feel like the square shape doesn&#x27;t give you as great of a view for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. I will be buying more as gifts for my friends!</li>
    <li> Exactly as represented. Sleek, light and looks good on the counter!</li>
    <li> We stayed in a Hotel at Incline Village and this mirror was in the bathroom in our room. My wife really liked it and commented that it would be great if she had a mirror like this at home. I ordered this mirror before we left Hyatt Regency I ordered this on amazon and it arrived a couple of days later. It was shipped fast and was packaged in a way that kept it safe. We got it before the promised date.</li>
    <li> I like the mirror, it looks sleek and elegant the only thing is I wish the magnification was greater for make up use. But can&#x27;t complain I got what I paid for and it is still a nice mirror.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking mirror and is great as a make-up mirror but for for my ageing eyesight i would have liked to have greater magnification - believe or not! :-) Nonetheless a nice addition to a womans bathroom</li>
