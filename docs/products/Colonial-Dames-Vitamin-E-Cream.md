      <li>(I have always been able to smell like no one imagines, so scents can be very intense for me and not enjoyable....</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I had the 12,000 IU long ago and it really helped with a scar from my knee replacement.  </li>

<li> I have been using Colonial Dames for 12 years at least.  </li>
<li> It is an artificial, industrial smell.</li>

    <li> Product excellent, purchase and shipping also excellent</li>
    <li> Very good for dry skin.  It has no odor and does not leave you oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell.  It is an artificial, industrial smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using Colonial Dames for 12 years at least.  Love that my face still looks young and I never have chapped skin in the winter.  My one and only complaint is I cannot find it in my local drug store anymore like I used to.  I am not interested in trying anything else, tried many before I found this.</li>
    <li> My favorite vitamin E cream for over 10 years!  A must have if you have dry skin.  Use at night and in morning before applying makeup, feels as smooth as butter.  Absolutely LOVE this product!!!</li>
    <li> great and works as deigned on scars</li>
    <li> Nice product but I wish they had an unscented one version.  I have to use it spareingly, and on my leg as the scent is too strong for me (I have always been able to smell like no one imagines, so scents can be very intense for me and not enjoyable....This isn&#x27;t terrible but it is strong in my mind).  Buy it is you don&#x27;t mind perfume scent.  It is pleasant but I would prefer, unscented (I use it on my scar from my hip surgery as it is better in this form being the oil is sticky and gets on clothing if you buy the oil version.  I like the oil one but I have to be more careful when I use it, usually, using it when I wear jeans so the oil does not come through the fabric).</li>
    <li> Great, everything was perfect.</li>

    <li> Very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a friend when she could not find it locally.. She loves it.  She has beautiful skin, says she has used this product since she was a teenager.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  came on time and we will reorder again.</li>
    <li> I like my vitamin E cream 28,000 IU, 4 oz. because it is so light. I use it at bedtime and in the morning.  It is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;i will continue to use it.  If they have a higher IU, i probably would prefer that.</li>
    <li> A must have staple in my skin care regimen.  Better than all the other vitamin-E creams on the market.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the third time ive purchase this for my grandmother, she seems to really love the product so i suggest it.</li>
    <li> A repeat order,  received on time and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> feels great on the face very creamy</li>
    <li> I had the 12,000 IU long ago and it really helped with a scar from my knee replacement.  At the time I didn&#x27;t know 28,000 IU was available.  Since I have been using it on my face, the wrinkles and fine lines are diminished greatly.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Great price used for years good for my face</li>
    <li> Simply one of the best vitamin E creams out there</li>
    <li> Best night cream there is, I love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This cream is smooth and goes on like butter your face looks a little greasy at first so a little goes a long way. It moisturizes very well and keeps your face looking fresh and dehydrated. I definitely will keep this as a beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will continue buying!!</li>
    <li> Best skin cream that I have ever tried. I have several friends that are using this product also.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It is not greasy, it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;And even better, just yesterday, someone thought I was 10 years younger than I really am  :)&lt;br /&gt;I will never run out of this product!</li>
    <li> Very strong fragrance I didn&#x27;t care for.  Because of the smell I didn&#x27;t use it enough to comment on effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I used it on my knee replacement scars!</li>
    <li> This cream is a bit greasy and not for daywear....also, no SPF. But as a night cream, it is the best! I do see a big difference in my skin since I began using this product (about 3 months). Fine lines are less noticable and my mature skin is getting the moisture it needs to stay radiant and smooth.</li>
