      <li>It is incredible.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the prompt delivery!  </li>
      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>If the lotion works great</li>
      <li>This product works great</li>
      <li>Great product for my skin type and color .</li>
      <li>Enjoy.. !!!</li>
      <li>Very nice non orange tan.</li>
      <li>This is the most perfect sunless tanning lotion ever !!!!</li>
      <li>It easy to use, and smells great going on!</li>
      <li>It works so good</li>
      <li>I have ordered this tanner before and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I liked this brand because it smells good and applies great.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, and gives me a beautiful tan without any orange tint.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with the color, it is not orange whatsoever and there are no streaks!</li>
      <li>You will be so pleased!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it looks great on and doesn&#x27;t have the funky smell that most sunless tanners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company shipped very quickly as well!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing....</li>
      <li>Great color and not a bad smell at all once it dries.</li>
      <li>I put in on with a glove &amp; it goes on very smooth &amp; even.</li>
      <li>Read many reviews to do my research</li>
      <li>Plus the more I rubbed the grimier it got, it beaded up and rolled across my legs</li>
      <li>You obviously smooth it in to your skin, but it isn&#x27;t a nice tan color at all.  </li>
      <li>my husband laughed though as soon as he saw me, I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh too.  </li>
      <li>I also think gloves allow the lotion soak into your skin better, rather than soaking into your hands.</li>
      <li>its better then paying 24.95 plus tax and shipping from site.</li>
      <li>It is like magic, I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>then I know the solution is even better, can&#x27;t wait :)</li>
      <li>This product is actually pretty good.  </li>
      <li>The cost of this fabulous lotion is not expensive either so take it from me purchase this product and go get your compliments !!!</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>The color of the tanner is VERY VERY chocolate brown and easy to see (which is why I was hopeful!)</li>
      <li>great product, great color - only worked on my arms and legs was the only problem).</li>
      <li>wow you have a nice tan.</li>
      <li>The odor is not bad, but I would not buy it again because of the color.  </li>
      <li>It goes on super orange-y, too.</li>
      <li>So worth the price, I will be buying this for a while.</li>
      <li>Seller sent quickly and was exactly what was on the site.</li>
      <li>and it smells pretty good (although not as good as Fake Bake).</li>
      <li>Nice dark color, goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and it was not too dark for me at all.</li>
      <li>kudos to the fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This is that tanner if you are looking for an even rich touch to your natural color.  </li>
      <li>If I moisturize daily, my tan will last up to a week and fades fairly evenly.</li>
      <li>It looked alright at first, but it seemed really streaky, almost orangey, and the bottle went way too fast!</li>
      <li>Im positive</li>
      <li>I am much darker after one use and with no streaks.</li>
      <li>I worked fast like reviewers said and in sections too, but I stopped after seeing what it was doing to my legs.  </li>
      <li>use a full pump of this stuff; just  a third of that</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find a good, natural looking tanner for dark-skinned people.  </li>
      <li>I was using fake bake self tanning lotion, and even that wasn&#x27;t that great......</li>
      <li>I rubbed on more hoping it would change after a few minutes...</li>
      <li>I have only applied this twice, and my skin has a golden tan that looks like it came from spending hours laying out in the sun.</li>
      <li>Tint is just right to make you have an instant tan even for the palest skin.</li>
      <li>I should go with the medium or the dark, and I am very glad I went with the dark.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
      <li>So far so good….</li>
      <li>You have to put it on quickly because of this, so it&#x27;s hard to keep it even.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is how quickly it dries.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is a gradual tan, but I applied it to the areas other self tanners haven&#x27;t worked to really put this stuff to the test (before I really write this stuff off, I will try it on my arms and legs).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not recommend this product at all. It&#x27;s sticky and has an unpleasant smell. It goes on super orange-y, too. I ended up throwing away.</li>
    <li> It works so good the only thing is it washes away after a day it sucks but it makes me look so dark</li>
    <li> I have done spray tan and about almost every self tanner out there. I liked this brand because it smells good and applies great. I was using fake bake self tanning lotion, and even that wasn&#x27;t that great......Im only going to use this brand moving forward. So happy I gave this one a chance!!!</li>
    <li> I usually order St. Tropez bronzing mousse, but i decided to try something different....bad idea. It looked alright at first, but it seemed really streaky, almost orangey, and the bottle went way too fast! Will definately stick with ST. Tropez next time!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing....I love the smell, and gives me a beautiful tan without any orange tint. If I moisturize daily, my tan will last up to a week and fades fairly evenly. I would definitely recommend this tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> I ordered the solution and awaiting for it to come in, but I couldn&#x27;t wait so I found the same lotion 4 oz. Ultra dark at bed bath and beyond for 10 its better then paying 24.95 plus tax and shipping from site. Amazon has it cheaper but if can call your local bed bath beyond and you may find it. This product works great I suggest to wear gloves because it will stain ur hands. Very nice non orange tan. If the lotion works great then I know the solution is even better, can&#x27;t wait :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a good, natural looking tanner for dark-skinned people.  This is that tanner if you are looking for an even rich touch to your natural color.  I use this for a week before stepping out on stage, and I always get compliments on my color.</li>
    <li> Mixed with my lotion to apply. Worked well, a little off color around ankles, maybe my fault in applying.</li>
    <li> this was by far the most disgusting tanning product I have ever used.  Im positive the seller gave me an old bottle for one, and it came out a gross murky green color and I was hesitant to try it but I did.  I&#x27;ve used lotions plenty of times and sprays too so I am not a beginner.  I worked fast like reviewers said and in sections too, but I stopped after seeing what it was doing to my legs.  It went on green...literally green.  I rubbed on more hoping it would change after a few minutes...maybe it need time to develop?  Wrong.  Sooo wrong.  Plus the more I rubbed the grimier it got, it beaded up and rolled across my legs and it just would not blend in at all.  So of course I was left with murky green colored legs...my husband laughed though as soon as he saw me, I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh too.  Returned it.  Would suggest to look at ANY other product before starting here.</li>
    <li> BEST SELF TANNER EVER!</li>
    <li> This is the most perfect sunless tanning lotion ever !!!! Great color and not a bad smell at all once it dries. Non stop I get compliments from everybody always saying wow you have a nice tan. Little do they know it came out of a bottle.And it last a&lt;br /&gt;very long time too !!!! The cost of this fabulous lotion is not expensive either so take it from me purchase this product and go get your compliments !!! Enjoy.. !!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the prompt delivery!  I haven&#x27;t used the product yet but I did open the bottle to see what it smelled like and again no disapointment here.  So far so good….</li>
    <li> This product is actually pretty good.  Best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve used so far.  My only complaint is how quickly it dries.  You have to put it on quickly because of this, so it&#x27;s hard to keep it even.  Otherwise, it looks great on and doesn&#x27;t have the funky smell that most sunless tanners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company shipped very quickly as well!</li>
    <li> Nice dark color, goes on smoothly. This is the only product that is dark enough to match my tan body and I&#x27;ve tried all of them!</li>
    <li> this lasted me only 2 weeks, this was a waist of my money. I would definitely go for a bigger size</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner. I put in on with a glove &amp; it goes on very smooth &amp; even. This is the only self tanner I will use. It does not turn orange &amp; does not streak.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful! Must try for yourself! Tint is just right to make you have an instant tan even for the palest skin.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this tanner before and loved it.  I have used fake bake and other all natural tanners.  I think this&lt;br /&gt;one is the best color and it will get reasonably dark ( I have pale skin).  It will wear off on your clothes a bit, but&lt;br /&gt;that is the same with any tanner that I have used.  Seller sent quickly and was exactly what was on the site.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone! It is incredible. I was so torn between weather or not I should go with the medium or the dark, and I am very glad I went with the dark. I am fair skinned and it was not too dark for me at all. I am so pleased with the color, it is not orange whatsoever and there are no streaks! I have only applied this twice, and my skin has a golden tan that looks like it came from spending hours laying out in the sun. It easy to use, and smells great going on! The &amp;#34;self tanner smell&amp;#34; is apparent a little bit when I wake up in the morning, but it is hardly bothersome and it seems to go away quickly. I do recommend gloves, because you will get brown hands! I also think gloves allow the lotion soak into your skin better, rather than soaking into your hands. I am so excited that I can get a dark tan without having to work hard for it or spend hours in the sun damaging my skin. This lotion will give you a tan that does not look like it came from a bottle. So worth the price, I will be buying this for a while. It is like magic, I absolutely LOVE this product. And again, if you are debating between medium and dark, go with the darker one. You will be so pleased!</li>
    <li> Great product for my skin type and color . This product is something I have been looking for- finally found it</li>
    <li> Great Product. Read many reviews to do my research this product size was perfect to try. I got about 4-5 applications which is just enough to judge how well you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I have ever used!!! I am much darker after one use and with no streaks.I recommend this lotion to all.</li>
    <li> I look like I fell face down in the toaster!  That&#x27;s what I see when I look in the mirror at home. Under the fluorescent lights of the gym. I look jaundice. Liver anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use a full pump of this stuff; just  a third of that and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the lotion primarily because it comes on with a dark brown muddy color.  You obviously smooth it in to your skin, but it isn&#x27;t a nice tan color at all.  The odor is not bad, but I would not buy it again because of the color.  I wanted for my face as others have said it is the same and cheaper.</li>
    <li> I am a die hard Fake Bake fan (great product, great color - only worked on my arms and legs was the only problem). For some odd reason, self tanner does not seem to work anywhere except my arms and legs. Anywhere else and its like it doesn&#x27;t even stick to my skin? I was hoping Sun Labs Ultra Dark would do the trick. Woke up this morning with no color change at all! I&#x27;m not sure if this is a gradual tan, but I applied it to the areas other self tanners haven&#x27;t worked to really put this stuff to the test (before I really write this stuff off, I will try it on my arms and legs). The color of the tanner is VERY VERY chocolate brown and easy to see (which is why I was hopeful!) and it smells pretty good (although not as good as Fake Bake). Although I&#x27;m bummed this didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped, kudos to the fast shipping!</li>
