      <li>They need better packing....</li>
      <li>ive been using this for about a month and already seeing better results then with the prescription stuff.  </li>
      <li>Varsi Healthy Nails</li>
      <li>so far, so good.. fingers crossed!</li>
      <li>and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions from the website you should be just fine.</li>
      <li>It is the most effective, natural anti-fungus treatment, in nature.  </li>
      <li>I saw fresh healthy nail start to appear in about 4 weeks.</li>
      <li>This was recommended by my manicurist for a small spot of fungus, worked great,  will continue to use to make sure it stays healthy.</li>
      <li>I have to say that in just a small amount of time this product has helped my foot greatly.</li>
      <li>Price very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>It really does help to restore damaged nails!</li>
      <li>I first started using this about 9 months ago</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t,do this the first time around, but I bought a bottle of Tea Tree Oil, from the Meleuca tree.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is available here, but it is basically a medium size wire cutter, but with better padding on the grips and they open up a little more.  </li>
      <li>It really works..</li>
      <li>Thought my days with artificial nails were over, But this is working wonderfully.</li>

      <li>My friend suggested I use this on my nails daily to keep them healthy and so far, this seems to be working - my nails are stronger and shinier.</li>
      <li>On the plus side it is possibly the most natural treatment with the citrus.</li>
      <li>cured his Fugus and grew Normal nails</li>
      <li>This product was least effective of the products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>So far this has killed most of the nail fungus.</li>
      <li>A nail professional recommended it</li>
      <li>I will update this after 18 months or when it is completely gone.</li>
      <li>However it took about three purchases (9) bottles to get this far.</li>
      <li>I did have my nail tech keep my nails to a shorter length for the last 8 months or so as not to bang or loosen the new growth.</li>
      <li>ive been to the podiatrist and spent months on prescription anti fungals that have done absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>It takes a long time because you have to wait for the nail to completely grow out.</li>
      <li>If you have the same problem and yours is so thick that normal toenail clippers won&#x27;t work, there is a heavy duty clipper available.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using this steadily for months, and haven&#x27;t had the stupid fungus totally disappear, but it seems to be beaten back by the product.  </li>
<li> When I get a little irritation...</li>
<li> looks like in a few months.</li>
<li> and it appears that I only have about 1/4 inch of bad nail left to correct.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s a small penalty to pay for the job it&#x27;s doing.</li>
<li> It always seems to get the job done, but it will take at least one month, may two.</li>
<li> I have to admit that it is a slow process</li>
<li> I was disappointed to discover that this product has a yellowish tint, rather than clear.  </li>
<li> Week after week I trimmed off the ugly stuff until it was finally gone.</li>
<li> I had very thick toenails, along with discoloration.  </li>
<li> The smell is a bit offputting and it is difficult to apply</li>
<li> I would suggest that depending on how bad it is that you just buy three bottles from the start.</li>
<li> Tried another product it was terrible.</li>

    <li> This product was least effective of the products I&#x27;ve tried so far. And the dark orange color can stain your nails as other reviewers have mentioned. Also I found it to be very watery and difficult to apply without spilling. On the plus side it is possibly the most natural treatment with the citrus.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my manicurist for a small spot of fungus, worked great,  will continue to use to make sure it stays healthy. Tried another product it was terrible.</li>
    <li> This product works great if you consistently use it.  it has to go thru the entire process of the nail growing out</li>
    <li> This stuff has cured my Husbands toe nails great product. cured his Fugus and grew Normal nails Varsi Healthy Nails</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any improvement after a month</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. My nails are beautiful and healthy as a result.</li>
    <li> Well, this stuff does seem to work. I read on their website that it will take about 18 months and I have been using this for about 11 months. So far this has killed most of the nail fungus. I would suggest that depending on how bad it is that you just buy three bottles from the start. If you follow the directions from the website you should be just fine. I will update this after 18 months or when it is completely gone.</li>
    <li> Received product immediately.  Price very reasonable.  Hopefully it will work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Varisi several times over the years. It always seems to get the job done, but it will take at least one month, may two.</li>
    <li> I just started using it but it appears it is going to be very good.  I will let you know later how well it works over all as his is an over time product</li>
    <li> Product arrived in 3 days</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and it has improved my nails by 50%. Will continue to use this, as I have tryed many differnt products out there, but this so far is the best Ive seen. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! Forget trying all other fungus stuff on the market, this is the ONLY stuff to use ever again!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  A nail professional recommended it and I further recommend it to anyone who has this&lt;br /&gt;nail problem.</li>
    <li> It really does help to restore damaged nails!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Initially to get rid of my toe fungus and then prophylactically to prevent it from recurring. If you don&#x27;t continue to use something, fungus does recurr.</li>
    <li> My friend suggested I use this on my nails daily to keep them healthy and so far, this seems to be working - my nails are stronger and shinier. The smell is a bit offputting and it is difficult to apply but I had a tiny brush lying around from another product so I use that and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Thought my days with artificial nails were over, But this is working wonderfully. My nails are on the mend. It does take dedication on your part. AM &amp; PM applications. But finally 11 months after my nails are all (10) of them finally almost fully reattached to the nail bed. Had a nail fungus and it spread to all 10 nails. I will never be without this again. I did have my nail tech keep my nails to a shorter length for the last 8 months or so as not to bang or loosen the new growth. Go for this product. I will always use this as a preventitive.</li>
    <li> Great product....it works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for all nails. When I get a little irritation...I put a drop or two and irritation is gone!</li>
    <li> ive been to the podiatrist and spent months on prescription anti fungals that have done absolutely nothing.  after reading the reviews I just bought 3 bottles to start.  ive been using this for about a month and already seeing better results then with the prescription stuff.  Im very happy and hopeful with this product.  so far, so good.. fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to discover that this product has a yellowish tint, rather than clear.  Rather than risk discoloration of my nail beds, I chose not to use it.</li>
    <li> I used Varisi faithfully for about 11 months and it worked perfectly on my big toe. It takes a long time because you have to wait for the nail to completely grow out. I saw fresh healthy nail start to appear in about 4 weeks. Week after week I trimmed off the ugly stuff until it was finally gone. It&#x27;s been about 8 years and the fungus has NOT returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this steadily for months, and haven&#x27;t had the stupid fungus totally disappear, but it seems to be beaten back by the product.  My sister (a nurse) said that hers cleared up totally, so that&#x27;s why I bought it.  It is totally painless, and nothing else seems to work half as well for me (including prescription medication), so I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months. I have noticed a remarkable difference in the area that I am using it.. It really works.. I have tried other products</li>
    <li> I ordered these based on the feedback here.  I had used the brand &amp;#34;TINEACIDE&amp;#34; before purchasing this&lt;br /&gt;anti-fungus medication.  I had run out and I tried this instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t,do this the first time around, but I bought a bottle of Tea Tree Oil, from the Meleuca tree.  It is the most effective, natural anti-fungus treatment, in nature.  I now add some to a bottle of the Tinneacide.  I had very thick toenails, along with discoloration.  The Tinneacide softened up the &#x27;stuff&#x27; under the thick, outer edge such that I could trim them.  If you have the same problem and yours is so thick that normal toenail clippers won&#x27;t work, there is a heavy duty clipper available.  I don&#x27;t know if it is available here, but it is basically a medium size wire cutter, but with better padding on the grips and they open up a little more.  But, wire cutters will work as well.</li>
    <li> Went through 3 bottles treating nail fungi for perhaps 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to kill or weaken the fungus but not permanently.</li>
    <li> I first started using this about 9 months ago and it appears that I only have about 1/4 inch of bad nail left to correct. However it took about three purchases (9) bottles to get this far. I have tried other products but this is the only one that seems to work for me. I have to admit that it is a slow process but the progress can&#x27;t be denied. I probably will have to purchase it again in order to get the job done but it&#x27;s a small penalty to pay for the job it&#x27;s doing.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works - like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I recommend it for anyone that needs stronger nails.</li>
    <li> I like the product but it came in in a padded envelope .... which was open on 1 side so I only got 2 bottles instead of 3.... They need better packing....</li>
    <li> I have to say that in just a small amount of time this product has helped my foot greatly. I&#x27;m looking for to work my fever looks like in a few months. yea!</li>
