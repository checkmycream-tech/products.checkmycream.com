      <li>so worth it!  </li>
      <li>These wipes are a bit pricey, but worth it!</li>
      <li>I bought these wipes to keep to clean his hands on the go, but the smell is obnoxious.</li>
      <li>I ordered these wipes for my grandson  on line because they are hard to find and are perfect for newborns.  </li>
      <li>I used to be able to swab almost a whole toddler bottom, poopy or not, with one sheet.</li>
      <li>They smell great and don&#x27;t crumble like other brands.</li>
      <li>I originally bought these wipes from Nordstroms (figured if they are sold there they must be good) but have hardly used them because of the incredibly strong odor of the perfume the wipes are bathed in.  </li>
      <li>For me, personally, they work wonders and the scent is always a nice pick-me-up.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use them as a regular diaper wipe - They are great for a quick refresh wipe - the wipes smell really good - and the smell is long lasting.</li>
      <li>I recommend these to anyone who needs a gentle disposable wipe to clean a baby or child&#x27;s face.  </li>
      <li>These wipes though a bit more expensive have worked great for us.</li>
      <li>I started with bath oils, shampoo &amp; conditioner, massage oil, and lotion; all of which smell pleasant &amp; light if not good, and seem to work well on his skin...</li>
      <li>My family has used this product line with enthusiasm since my first born was a baby.</li>
      <li>They are great wipes, but not worth 5 times what I paid for Pampers sensitive wipes.</li>
      <li>First off, these get FIVE STARS for softness and moisture and cleaning-goodness.  </li>
      <li>They work well for &lt;br /&gt;sponge baths when there&#x27;s no time for a real bath!</li>
      <li>Very soothing for baby!</li>
      <li>Yes, this is our first baby.</li>
      <li>The scent is wonderful and subtle and the texture is gentle for baby&#x27;s sensitive bottom.</li>
      <li>Much larger, and gentle on the skin and a much better buy for the money.</li>
      <li>I purchased these wipes based on the positive reviews listed here.</li>
      <li>It has a gentle scent, and leaves my baby&#x27;s skin soft but clean.  </li>
      <li>It is so strong, and gross.</li>
      <li>Personally, I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable rubbing that much fragrance oil on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>and with these you get twice as many for only a few dollars more-</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I think they are moister and smell better than other wipes.</li>
      <li>She is now 11 and took several of the products from this line on a camping trip to stay clean.</li>
      <li>the things you learn as a new mom!</li>
      <li>I use them mainly as makeup removers but also carry them around with me everywhere</li>
      <li>Every product is so good for a baby&#x27;s delicate skin!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I had seen the Mustela products in high end cosmetic stores for years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these wipes for 6 months now, and think they&#x27;re worth the extra money.  </li>
      <li>This is the first Mustella product that fell short for me.</li>
      <li>I have only positive remarks for these wipes.</li>
      <li>Why would we want it anywhere near our baby&#x27;s skin?\\&quot;     &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand how anyone likes the smell of these wipes and would want them anywhere near their baby.</li>
      <li>Wow...</li>
      <li>Having sensitive skin myself, I treated my son as if he was going to have it.  </li>
      <li>On the rare occassion when I&#x27;ve run out before I was organized enough to order my next shipment, I&#x27;ve had to make do with some Huggies or Pampers wipes, and even the sensitive ones leave a tackiness that you never have with Mustela.  </li>
      <li>she has sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Even though I love the scent, I imagine it is not good for a baby&#x27;s new skin.</li>
      <li>I also rip each wipe into thirds because I don&#x27;t need a whole wipe for my tiny daughter&#x27;s little face- and just push the remainder back into the pack for next time.  </li>

<li> Wish they were not so expensive.</li>

It has a gentle scent, and leaves my baby&#x27;s skin soft but clean.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow...the things you learn as a new mom! I purchased these wipes based on the positive reviews listed here. As I was setting up the nursery this weekend I opened the wipes and was blown away by the stench of them! My husband walked into the nursery and immediately noticed the pungent odor. To quote him ; \\&quot;Whoa ! Those wipes smell worse than the mess we&#x27;re supposed to be wiping off the baby! What kind of chemicals produce that kind of smell? Why would we want it anywhere near our baby&#x27;s skin?\\&quot;     &#x27;Nuff said. What a waste of money. Wipes are no in the trash.</li>
    <li> I ordered these wipes for my grandson  on line because they are hard to find and are perfect for newborns.  It&#x27;s a great product line and  I was glad to find it on Amarzon.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the Mustela facial cloths for my baby&#x27;s face- she has sensitive skin and I would use them after a feeding etc. in lieu of a washcloth and soap b/c they were more convenient.  I saw these and compared the ingredients to those in the Mustela facial cloths and they are basically the same product- and with these you get twice as many for only a few dollars more- so worth it!  I recommend these to anyone who needs a gentle disposable wipe to clean a baby or child&#x27;s face.  Oh- I also rip each wipe into thirds because I don&#x27;t need a whole wipe for my tiny daughter&#x27;s little face- and just push the remainder back into the pack for next time.  They rip easily and it is a good way to make them last longer.</li>
    <li> I know that after looking at the price tag, one might be confused why I say economical; however, when you only need one wipe to do the job that would take 3 wipes with other brands (for those exploding messes) - they are a value.

I have only positive remarks for these wipes.</li>
    <li> I got these wipes after using several other mustela products for my sons sensitive skin. They worked great! These wipes though a bit more expensive have worked great for us. No irritation at all and I love the smell. Love the mustela line. I alternate these with dispoable cotton wash cloths Wypall brand.</li>
    <li> Ugh!  First off, these get FIVE STARS for softness and moisture and cleaning-goodness.  HOWEVER... all of these positives are 100% nullified by the terribly potent chemical odor they give off!  HOW CAN PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKE THAT STENCH???  Those people must work for the company, because these are truly the most god-awful smelling things EVER!  A stench like that could not possibly be natural... they must use strange and toxic synthetic ingredients to get that smell.  AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS !</li>
    <li> This wipes is the best. It smells good, non-alcoholic &lt;br /&gt;and is perfect for even the most sensitive skin. Try &lt;br /&gt;it! You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> These wipes are a bit pricey, but worth it! Very sturdy &amp; while some complain of the scent, I happen to love it! Very soothing for baby!</li>
    <li> As describe, on time.</li>
    <li> These wipes are expensive, but many times I will only have to use one, even for a big mess. With other wipes I will have to use 3 or 4, so actually they end up being not as expensive as you think.   I think they are moister and smell better than other wipes.</li>
    <li> I am a mom and a pediatrician and have been buying this and other Mustela products since my 7 year old was a newborn. I just bought two packs for my little one and to my surprise, the sheets were smaller, thinner and less moist than before.  For the money, in this day and age I think this is the last pack I&#x27;ll buy. I used to be able to swab almost a whole toddler bottom, poopy or not, with one sheet. No longer. The two stars are for the fragrance which is heavenly. You&#x27;ll do better to mist your child&#x27;s clothes with the Mustela fragrance spray and buy Huggies wipes instead. Much larger, and gentle on the skin and a much better buy for the money. I guess Mustela didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d notice the change, but this mom did!</li>
    <li> My kids have used these since birth - I got them as a gift and have never stopped using them - my kids are 3 and 4.   I wouldn&#x27;t use them as a regular diaper wipe - They are great for a quick refresh wipe - the wipes smell really good - and the smell is long lasting.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone likes the smell of these wipes and would want them anywhere near their baby. They made my eyes water and gave me an instand headache. Dad disliked them too and made everything smell like them. Yuck, never again.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is our first baby. I had seen the Mustela products in high end cosmetic stores for years. Of course I had to try out everything for our Little One. Having sensitive skin myself, I treated my son as if he was going to have it.  Three months and not one diaper rash, no skin reaction - nothin&#x27;! Just a happy baby (and Mommy)!</li>
    <li> I would love to like these but each time I use them, they cause hundreds of bumps on my baby&#x27;s skin.  Even though I love the scent, I imagine it is not good for a baby&#x27;s new skin. I have great success with Seventh Generation wipes.</li>
    <li> I adore this stuff. The thickness and durability of these wipes are unparalleled and the scent is to die for. I use them mainly as makeup removers but also carry them around with me everywhere I go, be it the gym or camping. They&#x27;re also a great mid-day wipe for the face (especially in the sweltering summer heat). For me, personally, they work wonders and the scent is always a nice pick-me-up.</li>
    <li> We love these wipes. The scent is wonderful and subtle and the texture is gentle for baby&#x27;s sensitive bottom.</li>
    <li> I used this brand on my babies and now my daughter is having my first grand baby!  I don&#x27;t want her to use anything but Mustela on her skin!  The products are so wonderful and allergy free.  They smell wonderful and fresh.  Every product is so good for a baby&#x27;s delicate skin!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> They are great wipes, but not worth 5 times what I paid for Pampers sensitive wipes. Wish they were not so expensive. I have switched to pampers for now.</li>
    <li> I have become a fast fan of Mustela products for my 3 year old who suffers from eczema. This is the first Mustella product that fell short for me. I started with bath oils, shampoo &amp; conditioner, massage oil, and lotion; all of which smell pleasant &amp; light if not good, and seem to work well on his skin... I bought these wipes to keep to clean his hands on the go, but the smell is obnoxious. It is so strong, and gross. I was trying to scrub the smell off my hands when I felt compelled to leave a review. Going to find another alternative.</li>
    <li> These cloths are awesome. They smell great and don&#x27;t crumble like other brands. They work well for &lt;br /&gt;sponge baths when there&#x27;s no time for a real bath! Love them.</li>
    <li> have been using this for a while. Pricy but nice. My wife loves the item and so does my grand daughter</li>
    <li> Mustela has the best line for babies and Mother&#x27;s to be. I recommend all its products. They have a great smell and are for the baby and its skin.</li>
