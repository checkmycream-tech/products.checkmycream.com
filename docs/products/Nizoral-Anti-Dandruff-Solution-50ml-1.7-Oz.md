### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Nizoral seems to be the best antidandruff shampoo I can find for itchy scalp and scaly scalp.  </li>
      <li>This product works great!  </li>
      <li>This is good for all anti-fungal uses!</li>
      <li>Worked great</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>This has been effective for us both for quite a while now</li>
      <li>I have found it even more effective than any shampoo or hairloss solution on the market.</li>
      <li>and we are both very relieved and happy.</li>
      <li>Make sure you check the volume of the item you&#x27;re ordering on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It looks like a trial size and cost so much more.</li>
      <li>Thanks for this amazing product,I got immediate results.</li>
      <li>great for dandruff and folliculitis just needed a larger size...still don&#x27;t know if you can get this otc anywhere</li>
      <li>Original product.</li>
      <li>I wish it was more reasonably priced, it&#x27;s not my fault</li>
      <li>Seriously, the best thing about this particular order is that I will be able to put it in my carry-on luggage.  </li>
      <li>It did a good job of stopping the itching I had, so perhaps that was fungus caused, but I am not sure it grew any more hair.  </li>
      <li>Now we are so happy little to no dandruff..</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re looking to get about 2 (maybe 3) washes out of each bottle, they are worth purchasing.  </li>
      <li>For anyone who cares I bought 2 bottles of Nizoral at Walmart for the first time in over 6 months.</li>
      <li>Pretty drying, as well.</li>
      <li>It also helps with thinning hair, which is a big plus :)</li>
      <li>i discovered that for me using tea tree oil for a week or so really remedies my situation.</li>
      <li>Works very well for my dandruff.</li>
      <li>This is clearly a knock off product!!  </li>
      <li>anyway, as far as flakes, I didnt think it did much for me.</li>
      <li>I suffered with moderate seborrheic dermatitis as a teen through young adulthood until I discovered H &amp; S clinical strength shampoo that took care of it for many years.</li>
      <li>Its blue-silver-colored creamy 1% formula is silkier to the touch, lightly scented and soaks the scalp in ways the red-orange or other syrupy alternative formulas cannot match.  </li>
      <li>The reasons Nizoral 1% ketoconazole - is still preferred EVEN over the always available (by prescription only) 2% generic ketoconazole -</li>
      <li>would wash my hair with a shampoo bar first, rinse, then apply a dime size drop of Nizoral to my scalp only and rub it in.</li>
      <li>The package I received this time was very strange looking, even the bottle just doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
      <li>After about 5 years of battling dandruff and constant dermatolgist visits I have finally found this to work consistently with no problem.  </li>
      <li>First of all I&#x27;m a 24yr old male, I&#x27;ve had dandruff since the age of 16 and nothing worked, Head and SHoulders, T-gel, Tea Tree, washing every other day, twice a day, three times a day, etc</li>
      <li>This is clearly something you will have to take your entire life for any results, the problem with that is the price of Nizoral!  </li>
      <li>i like this shampoo because of its smell and color (yes, its ocean blue :) and the fact that it suds up a lot (though not a good thing).  </li>
      <li>My daughter started developing the same problem in late adolescence into her teen years, however it was much more severe than I ever had it.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, ok product but FALSE advertisement.</li>

<li> My daughter started developing the same problem in late adolescence into her teen years, however it was much more severe than I ever had it.</li>
<li> Otherwise, ok product but FALSE advertisement.</li>
<li> During the past five years, Nizoral has only been available via a \\&quot;black</li>
<li> I took this for 2 months straight and had a 90% reduction in dandruff and no more itching, I decided to stop taking it after the problem was under control and within 2 weeks the Dandruff was back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Sellers have been asking for mind-boggling amounts of money for bottles of the original, \\&quot;gold-standard,\\&quot; Belgium-made-formula - taking advantage of buyers upset over the horrific red tape issues involving manufacturing standards associated with its makers, McNeil, Inc. in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania - and with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  </li>
<li> given that it could be a knock off, but I spent a decent amount of money for such a small amount.</li>
<li> I was considerably depressed due to this and wore hats everywhere due to the flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This created endless shortages and massive \\&quot;hoarding behavior\\&quot; throughout the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> No improvement for dry scalp and itching.  </li>
<li> It means no more daily checking at eBay or at other sites to buy this product at a cost equal to dinner at a five-star Parisian restaurant.  </li>
<li> Does not do as expected.  </li>
<li> There is very little shampoo, the container top is almost impossible to open, and you cannot store it upside down (like the 7 fl oz will) to get all of the shampoo from the container.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> instead I only got one small bottle of this stuff.</li>
<li> Ketoconazole actually actively works to stop hairloss.  </li>
<li> You get a tiny bottle and it costs about $10 with shipping/handling which is insane seeing as a regular bottle of Suave is like $3 or less and has 10 times more</li>
<li> We did this every other day for a couple of weeks, till all flakes were gone, then dropped down to once every other week or so.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m slightly concerned to use it</li>
<li> I purchased this small bottle to see if it worked at all, and within a few weeks our scalp problems were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not the real stuff, I also had a bad reaction from lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
<li> no more paying through your nose to get Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The packaging - from the box, to the label, to the bottle clearly not authentic Nizoral.  </li>
<li> I would then condition my hair as usual and this is what worked for me and my daughter.</li>
<li> No more pain to your wallet,</li>
<li> it&#x27;s so expensive and apparently not sold in stores anymore.</li>
<li> What does this mean to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but this one i think not good for me</li>
<li> Otherwise, this is not a great buy...</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s very expensive and hard to find.  </li>
<li> product states made by Johnson and Johnson, called Johnson and Johnson, they said it&#x27;s not their product, this is absolutely fake!</li>
<li> Too bad</li>
<li> i get flakes in btw seasons and when weather changes so its very inconvenient</li>

    <li> Nizoral seems to be the best antidandruff shampoo I can find for itchy scalp and scaly scalp.  I would recommend it to anyone who has this problem.</li>
    <li> i like this shampoo because of its smell and color (yes, its ocean blue :) and the fact that it suds up a lot (though not a good thing).  anyway, as far as flakes, I didnt think it did much for me. however, what does work for me is tea tree oil shampoo. it works wonders.  i get flakes in btw seasons and when weather changes so its very inconvenient and i have to go through this multiple times a year.  i discovered that for me using tea tree oil for a week or so really remedies my situation. hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Seriously, the best thing about this particular order is that I will be able to put it in my carry-on luggage.  Smallest bottle of Nizoral I&#x27;ve ever seen!  Make sure you check the volume of the item you&#x27;re ordering on Amazon.  It looks like a trial size and cost so much more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s medicine works well and does what I need it to do.  I&#x27;ll order again cause I could only find it here.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been suffering with dandruff for years..  We tried Nizoral after searching all stores for the product from Walmart to Kmart it was no place to be found.  Thank God Amazon had it..  Now we are so happy little to no dandruff..</li>
    <li> product states made by Johnson and Johnson, called Johnson and Johnson, they said it&#x27;s not their product, this is absolutely fake!</li>
    <li> This is clearly a knock off product!!  The packaging - from the box, to the label, to the bottle clearly not authentic Nizoral.  The shampoo inside is a different color, smell and consistency.  Beware!!!</li>
    <li> For anyone who cares I bought 2 bottles of Nizoral at Walmart for the first time in over 6 months. So Nizoral is making it&#x27;s way back onto store shelves! Don&#x27;t pay what these price gaugers are asking.I bought 7oz at Walmart today for $14.27 a bottle.</li>
    <li> Does not do as expected.  No improvement for dry scalp and itching.  Will see a M.D. for treatment and prescription shampoo.</li>
    <li> Off all the dandruff shampoos I have used this one works and stops the itch and flake. Will order it again.</li>
    <li> It worths every cent. Thanks for this amazing product,I got immediate results. All my life have suffered with dandruff and the itching at night was unbearable, this product have both my problem under control. I would recommend it to anyone with a dandruff problem</li>
    <li> i try big one befour was work but this one i think not good for me it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t works...........,,,;i don&#x27;t know why</li>
    <li> Worked great but it&#x27;s very expensive and hard to find.  Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive and apparently not sold in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> This was recommended for hair loss,due to the anti-fungal agent in it.  It did a good job of stopping the itching I had, so perhaps that was fungus caused, but I am not sure it grew any more hair.  Pretty drying, as well.</li>
    <li> This product works but they are in (basically) sample size bottles.  So if you&#x27;re looking to get about 2 (maybe 3) washes out of each bottle, they are worth purchasing.  Otherwise, this is not a great buy...</li>
    <li> After about 5 years of battling dandruff and constant dermatolgist visits I have finally found this to work consistently with no problem.  This product has an added bonus with anyone suffering from hairloss.  Ketoconazole actually actively works to stop hairloss.  I have found it even more effective than any shampoo or hairloss solution on the market.</li>
    <li> This product is used pre-wash.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Not the real stuff, I also had a bad reaction from lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this stuff....</li>
    <li> I suffered with moderate seborrheic dermatitis as a teen through young adulthood until I discovered H &amp; S clinical strength shampoo that took care of it for many years. It came back with a vengeance several years ago. My daughter started developing the same problem in late adolescence into her teen years, however it was much more severe than I ever had it. The H &amp; S just wasn&#x27;t working well for either of us anymore though so I tried several different products trying to find something that worked. I was prepared to take my daughter to the dermatologist if I couldn&#x27;t find anything OTC that worked. I did a lot of reading about seborrheic dermatitis, and decided I needed to try an anti fungal type treatment. Nizoral seemed to be the answer. I purchased this small bottle to see if it worked at all, and within a few weeks our scalp problems were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wash my hair with a shampoo bar first, rinse, then apply a dime size drop of Nizoral to my scalp only and rub it in. I let it sit for 5 minutes or so, then rinsed that out as well. I would then condition my hair as usual and this is what worked for me and my daughter. We did this every other day for a couple of weeks, till all flakes were gone, then dropped down to once every other week or so. This has been effective for us both for quite a while now and we are both very relieved and happy.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Works wonders!!!</li>
    <li> Original product. Works very well for my dandruff. Recommend shampooing twice as I saw minimum results with one lather !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before on Amazon and then also in stores. The package I received this time was very strange looking, even the bottle just doesn&#x27;t look right. I&#x27;m slightly concerned to use it given that it could be a knock off, but I spent a decent amount of money for such a small amount.</li>
    <li> * During the past five years, Nizoral has only been available via a \\&quot;black market\\&quot; of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sellers have been asking for mind-boggling amounts of money for bottles of the original, \\&quot;gold-standard,\\&quot; Belgium-made-formula - taking advantage of buyers upset over the horrific red tape issues involving manufacturing standards associated with its makers, McNeil, Inc. in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania - and with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This created endless shortages and massive \\&quot;hoarding behavior\\&quot; throughout the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* These issues have now been resolved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* What does this mean to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It means no more daily checking at eBay or at other sites to buy this product at a cost equal to dinner at a five-star Parisian restaurant.  No more pain to your wallet, no more paying through your nose to get Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Just check Amazon and/or Drugstore online and watch prices drop to under $16 for a hefty 7-ounce bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The reasons Nizoral 1% ketoconazole - is still preferred EVEN over the always available (by prescription only) 2% generic ketoconazole - are legion.  Its blue-silver-colored creamy 1% formula is silkier to the touch, lightly scented and soaks the scalp in ways the red-orange or other syrupy alternative formulas cannot match.  For thousands of people, it&#x27;s been the only thing that WORKS to treat scalp issues, which in turn created buyer desperation when it disappeared from store shelves, causing \\&quot;after-market\\&quot; prices to shoot to the moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Hence breathe a sigh of relief and shop around!  If you see a bottle of Nizoral at a retail store this week, don&#x27;t worry about \\&quot;stocking up\\&quot; as if you were at a Costco or a Sam&#x27;s Club preparing for the Armageddon.</li>
    <li> This product stated I would get 2 for the price of 1...instead I only got one small bottle of this stuff. Otherwise, ok product but FALSE advertisement.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;m a 24yr old male, I&#x27;ve had dandruff since the age of 16 and nothing worked, Head and SHoulders, T-gel, Tea Tree, washing every other day, twice a day, three times a day, etc NOTHING worked!!!!!I I was considerably depressed due to this and wore hats everywhere due to the flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I took this for 2 months straight and had a 90% reduction in dandruff and no more itching, I decided to stop taking it after the problem was under control and within 2 weeks the Dandruff was back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is clearly something you will have to take your entire life for any results, the problem with that is the price of Nizoral!  You get a tiny bottle and it costs about $10 with shipping/handling which is insane seeing as a regular bottle of Suave is like $3 or less and has 10 times more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I wish it was more reasonably priced, it&#x27;s not my fault I was born with this problem!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this when I had dandruff on head and eyebrows.  Now I order it from Amazon.  It also helps with thinning hair, which is a big plus :)</li>
    <li> Whether actual Nixoral or not, I would purchase the 7 fl oz. instead and not purchase this one.  There is very little shampoo, the container top is almost impossible to open, and you cannot store it upside down (like the 7 fl oz will) to get all of the shampoo from the container.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product and would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It helps...a lot. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> great for dandruff and folliculitis just needed a larger size...still don&#x27;t know if you can get this otc anywhere</li>
    <li> This product works great!  This is good for all anti-fungal uses!</li>
