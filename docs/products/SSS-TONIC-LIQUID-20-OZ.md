      <li>love this stuff...</li>
      <li>I am glad that I had self-doubt and started looking toward nutrition as the cause for my woe, instead of you know electronic harassment by AT&amp;T and the NSA using psychotronic weaponry from space and what not.</li>

      <li>I love this iron supplement.</li>

      <li>I have added more fruits, beans, lentils, etc.</li>
      <li>I have been taking it for about 2 months now and feel much better.  </li>
      <li>It might not taste that great at first, but you get used to it and most importantly, it serves it&#x27;s purpose specifically because it comes in liquid form and is paired with B vitamins for better absorption.</li>
      <li>I had been taking iron pills, but I don&#x27;t think I was able to absorb the iron as easily as this liquid.  </li>
      <li>:) Glad to see it is still as useful and valued as I thought!</li>
      <li>If you have problems with anemia, I strongly suggest you use this product as directed it does work and continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I do take it with water, though, because the taste is quite strong.</li>
      <li>lol I thought I was gonna have to go to my local vet to get some</li>
      <li>I have loved this stuff since I was a teenager and an aunt told me it would help clear up my acne...which it did.</li>
      <li>so I can be positive I will be able to donate bc</li>
      <li>but this product is wonderful and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do very well been taking this since I was little</li>
      <li>Thus the reason I am on here AFTER I checked to make sure it was still OK for human consumption!</li>
      <li>I received iron injections the first month.</li>
      <li>oh yeh, it tastes very nasty,but it does its job!</li>
      <li>If you are suffering from the symptoms of iron deficiency this product will definitely help to increase your iron and you will feel better.</li>
      <li>&gt;  : After a month my energy level is higher</li>
      <li>It really helps him keep his energy up.</li>
      <li>but I experience them as real.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know if they were real or not,</li>
      <li>There is no iron supplement that is going to work as quickly as SSS Tonic after all these years and many other iron supplements later...</li>
      <li>I was scheduled to have a full hysterectomy for heavy cycles until I asked my doctor to check full iron studies.  </li>
      <li>A week later I was able to sing short songs to my children at bedtime.  </li>
      <li>This product is highly recommended for people with iron deficiencies and anemia.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and I will still need something stronger that an ole iron tablet to keep my levels normal....</li>
      <li>I also was seeing stars, feeling stalked, seeing ufos, and other things and finally had enough and tried this SSS tonic at walmart due to it having Iron and B vitamins, which were both suggested for anemia, which was one of the more popular causes for the venous hum thing (and</li>
      <li>When I first started going to my hematologist and got the results of my CBC back....</li>
      <li>luckily came across SSS Tonic and after the second dose, my color vision was coming back!  </li>
      <li>he was ike..\\&quot;wow what are you doing in addition to the infusions?\\&quot;</li>
      <li>low normal starts at 11!.</li>
      <li>But be careful, to much iron can give you herpies sores so as the old saying goes, everything in moderastion.</li>
      <li>If you take it at the recommended dose (3 tbsp/day) on an empty stomach with vitamin C, your iron and ferritin levels will go up FAST.  </li>
      <li>At any rate, I must have developed a nutritional problem because I started to get venous hum, which is where your eardrum vibrates annoyingly, especially when it&#x27;s silent.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Made me incredibly sick to my stomach within minutes of taking it. Tried 5 diff times</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this. He has used it for years. It is hard to find in stores. The price is great!</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed as anemic, and my doctor told me to take iron tablets.  I knew from past experience that iron tablets including the slow release ferrous sulfate irritated my ulcer and caused me to be constipated.  My doctor said to take it once a day instead of twice, but I knew that was not the answer.  My sister, who is a nurse, suggested I take SSS Tonic.  I have been taking it for about 2 months now and feel much better.  SSS does not irritate my ulcer or cause constipation.  It doesn&#x27;t taste great, but it works great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product over a few years when I was recovering from illness. In a few days my tiredness was gone and I felt like my old self. Wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> When I first started going to my hematologist and got the results of my CBC back....7.4 hemoglobin!!...low normal starts at 11!. Anyhoo...I started on weekly iron infusions...for 2 months...during my 2nd month I began to take the SSS tonic and increased my intake of vitamin C (which binds iron)...when I last saw my Dr...he was ike..\\&quot;wow what are you doing in addition to the infusions?\\&quot;..I told him, and he said to  \\&quot;keep it up\\&quot;...I know that I am a lifelong purchaser of this product, because eventually the infusions will be cut to once a month and I will still need something stronger that an ole iron tablet to keep my levels normal....love this stuff...oh yeh, it tastes very nasty,but it does its job!</li>
    <li> After just a couple of days, you feel the difference.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with anemia, I strongly suggest you use this product as directed it does work and continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This company has great customer service &amp; product works as others have stated.</li>
    <li> I have loved this stuff since I was a teenager and an aunt told me it would help clear up my acne...which it did. It wasn&#x27;t til I read the label that I realized it could also help with the anemia I suffered from regularly and had to get an iron shot for X-( That was the 70s and I have used it off and on ever since.  There is no iron supplement that is going to work as quickly as SSS Tonic after all these years and many other iron supplements later...But lately I cant find it. And the local pharmacist literally said it is not for sale for HUMAN consumption....Thus the reason I am on here AFTER I checked to make sure it was still OK for human consumption! I am a teacher and when blood drives come up, I look for SSS Tonic so I can be positive I will be able to donate bc I am always low on iron. So shame on me for not keeping up but ..lol I thought I was gonna have to go to my local vet to get some :) Glad to see it is still as useful and valued as I thought!</li>
    <li> looks and works like it should!(what  I ordered)</li>
    <li> I am currently anemic and have a hemoglobin level of 7 which is considered low for a female. I had low energy, pale skin, etc. I decided to try S.S.S. because of reviews, prior knowledge of the product, and my Ferrol tonic ran out (I ran out of it and was unable to find it anywhere).&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I received the order as scheduled.&lt;br /&gt;  : After a month my energy level is higher&lt;br /&gt;  : My skin does not look as pale&lt;br /&gt;  : My eyes don&#x27;t feel and look as tired&lt;br /&gt;  : I don&#x27;t have a great desire to eat ice&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It taste bad. I must say despite the taste I rather take it than have low energy and hemoglobin.&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add I take Organic blackstrap molasses.&lt;br /&gt;I have also altered my diet some. I make juices such as beet juice, kale juice, and spinach juice. I have added more fruits, beans, lentils, etc. to my diet. I am trying to stay away from dairy products. It&#x27;s challenging. I try to substitute cow&#x27;s milk with soy milk. I have also substituted cheese with nondairy cheese such as Daiya.&lt;br /&gt;I will be repeating the test to see if my iron level has improved or not. When I get my results I will update if Amazon allows me to. I have never tried to do an update.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  It really helps him keep his energy up.</li>
    <li> I love this iron supplement. It might not taste that great at first, but you get used to it and most importantly, it serves it&#x27;s purpose specifically because it comes in liquid form and is paired with B vitamins for better absorption. You feel the difference in energy levels within days and it doesn&#x27;t cause constipation as most iron supplements tend to.</li>
    <li> I am anemic with low iron. When I take this regularly, I notice a difference in my energy levels almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I  started taking taking S.S.S.B- Complex and have not had a cold in a year. I even seem to sleep better.</li>
    <li> This product is highly recommended for people with iron deficiencies and anemia.  It helps me immensely, as it takes no time getting through to your system and restoring your body&#x27;s deficiency of B vitamins and iron!</li>
    <li> This is the best Iron Tonic ever. It also increase your energy when you are in a slump, great fro night shift workers</li>
    <li> Buyers beware! This product contains saccharine and ethol alcohol !!!! Company does not pay return shipping and charges a 15% restocking fee!! What a ripoff!!</li>
    <li> Perfect quality it is the easiest iron supplement to drink.  I can almost immediately feel a difference in my energy levels.</li>
    <li> Great just as described.</li>
    <li> I made several dietary mistakes from stress, laziness after switching to vegetarian earlier this year.  Well, vegetarian sounds at first like eating vegetables, but out of laziness, I was eating ramen, toast, pastas, stupid / easy dry goods stuff because I live in a remote area.  At any rate, I must have developed a nutritional problem because I started to get venous hum, which is where your eardrum vibrates annoyingly, especially when it&#x27;s silent.  This is a separate thing from tinnitus.  I also was seeing stars, feeling stalked, seeing ufos, and other things and finally had enough and tried this SSS tonic at walmart due to it having Iron and B vitamins, which were both suggested for anemia, which was one of the more popular causes for the venous hum thing (and also schizophrenia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took it, almost immediately helped the hum thing.  Got energy back.  Started feeling more rational.  I look back at these ufos I saw and I don&#x27;t know if they were real or not, but I experience them as real.  The other paranoid feelings are gone and now I&#x27;m back on with my life.  I am glad that I had self-doubt and started looking toward nutrition as the cause for my woe, instead of you know electronic harassment by AT&amp;T and the NSA using psychotronic weaponry from space and what not.</li>
    <li> This is a very, very effective product for resolving anemia quickly.  If you take it at the recommended dose (3 tbsp/day) on an empty stomach with vitamin C, your iron and ferritin levels will go up FAST.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I suffer from chronic fatigue imune disfunction, which sometimes leaves me emotionally and physically exhausted.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that gives me the energy I need to keep going.  It does wonders for the skin also.  No don&#x27;t put it on your skin, Drink it silly.  But be careful, to much iron can give you herpies sores so as the old saying goes, everything in moderastion.</li>
    <li> This liquid iron has helped my energy levels to improve.  I had been taking iron pills, but I don&#x27;t think I was able to absorb the iron as easily as this liquid.  I do take it with water, though, because the taste is quite strong.</li>
    <li> If you are suffering from the symptoms of iron deficiency this product will definitely help to increase your iron and you will feel better. It has been around for over 50 years and I can understand why, it works.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the taste but this product is wonderful and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do very well been taking this since I was little</li>
    <li> Doctors gave me different types of iron for anemia from heavy periods, but my body would not absorb them. They wanted to do a hysterectomy, but I was not ready to accept that option. My iron was so low from taking I car c, that they told me I wasn&#x27;t  taking it, and needed a blood transfusion. I remembered  the  SSS Tonic my grandmother  use to take. I bought it and after 2 weeks, I did not need any blood transfusion! My iron was building  up quickly without  the nasty side effects  of the other iron supplements. Thank you SSS! It&#x27;s  not told enough, the benefits of this vitamin.</li>
    <li> The Ethyl Alcohol made me quite sick for several days. If you have any issues with your stomach, you need to think twice on this one.</li>
    <li> I am a physician who suffered a slow and insidious malnutrition from high patient work loads and extra family responsibilities at home.  This loss of health occured over approximately 2 years and was marked by recurrent kidney and uterine infections , rapidly growing fibroids, and random passing out episodes.  I was scheduled to have a full hysterectomy for heavy cycles until I asked my doctor to check full iron studies.  To both our surprise, I was still alive and half way functional with an iron level of 4. Other symptoms included brain fog,inability to walk up steps, inability to sing for long periods of time to my children, and I was losing color vision in my left eye.  I received iron injections the first month. The hysterectomy and my job were put on hold for 2 months.  I tried Iron tablets afterwards and I felt worse with severe constipation and continued symptoms above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I luckily came across SSS Tonic and after the second dose, my color vision was coming back!  A week later I was able to sing short songs to my children at bedtime.  I was not gasping for air while talking with others.  1 month later I am in the gym doing yoga and contemplating some muscle building exercises.  My iron has tripled.  My doctor and I are amazed.  I would very highly recommend SSS Tonic  supplement to any patient suffering iron deficiency anemia and all of its subtle and not so subtle side effects. Anemia and Iron still need to be followed with your physician. As for me, the hysterectomy is officially cancelled, the fibroids have shrunk and I will be going back to work to care for others soon.  Thank you SSS tonic!</li>
    <li> I wanted to address the stomach issues, which I never have had when taking SSS.  I think if you eat and then take SSS, it won&#x27;t harm your stomach.  But I will also add that if you are taking medications for your stomach, the SSS could interfere with the medication - best to ask your pharmacist.  However, if you can in any way take SSS, I highly recommend it for tired people.  The fact that it makes you feel great is worth everything.  The label states that it also helps with immunity which is always a good thing.  The product is all Vitamin B - everyone needs all the Vit B they can tolerate to feel and be the ultimate human we are meant to be.  I would take an entire bottle, as recommended, then wait approximately three months before starting a new bottle.  This worked well for me.  I sincerely hope you will try it and you won&#x27;t regret your decision, I promise!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for weeks. No changes in iron level at all</li>
