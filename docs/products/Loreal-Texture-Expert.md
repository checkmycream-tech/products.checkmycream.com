### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>The best part of ordering it here is that it is $7.00 cheaper  and delivered before  the estimated date of delivery.</li>
      <li>The perfect finishing touch</li>
      <li>medium which is better than architecture and even closer to material - for $2.50!!!!</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal is the best from color to styling products they are fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>discontinued artec material line texture wax, which i absolutely LOVED!  </li>
      <li>Item was delivered in timely manner, all good!</li>
      <li>It is wonderful for controlling and styling your hair and is good for women as well as men.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
      <li>the price Amazon amazing!</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>This is a good wax.  </li>
      <li>Great product, love it, my clients love it.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice but not overbearing.</li>
      <li>This product is by far the best.</li>
      <li>My stylist recommended this since my hair is very fine.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the original &amp;#34;Material&amp;#34;,</li>
      <li>overall, an excellent matte hair paste and the best replacement i&#x27;ve found for the artec so far.</li>
      <li>It works very well with my hair and also has a great scent to it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s close to what it replaced Material which was my favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>as a woman, i&#x27;d prefer something more androgynous.  </li>
      <li>Great product at a decent price and arrived as promised.</li>
      <li>Works best for me when I apply about a nickel sized amount to my palms, rub my palms together to warm it up, then I work the product through my hair for a few minutes to make sure it&#x27;s evenly distributed.</li>
      <li>It offers a great hold while still allowing adjustability.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily.</li>
      <li>Easy to wash out with shampoo.</li>
      <li>first, this paste is a bit softer, which is nice in that it&#x27;s easier to rub into your hands and work into your hair.  </li>
      <li>Best product for fixing hair in place after dried and before spraying.</li>
      <li>Very fun product to play around with and see what you can do.</li>
      <li>the old artec material line wax, with its lovely coco-nutty smell and bone-dry texture, was a five star hit with me for many years.  </li>
      <li>perfect for styling without being sticky and stiff!</li>
      <li>It works very similar to the discontinued Artec Material...which i loved.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>Has a pleasant odor unlike some other paste products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to work into your hair and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling really heavy or greasy, plus the scent is more of a unisex so as a man I don&#x27;t have to worry about the dreaded &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell you get with a lot of hair products.</li>
      <li>It holds my very short hair in place without weighing it down, and the smell is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Great product, especially for short hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product overall</li>
      <li>As a longtime fan of Sumotech, the guy at the salon recommended this as a similar product but with better hold and applicability.</li>
      <li>and I bought this product from a local salon in West Hollywood because I wanted to find something that was easily applied to my hair, didn&#x27;t need 3 other products to make it work right, and provided strong hold throughout the day without being sticky or crunchy like waxes or gels.</li>
      <li>second, while this one smells nice too, its scent is slightly more masculine - a little musky, in fact.  </li>
      <li>I really work it in there and play with it until it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s any in there.</li>
      <li>However, I still pay the price because I like it so much.</li>
      <li>this newer texture expert paste comes pretty close, but it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its predecessor.  </li>
      <li>Husband uses for his short hair, I use to make my curls last :)</li>
      <li>I would  highly rcommend this product and purchase it here.</li>
      <li>for context, i have short to mid-length hair, and i use texture wax after rough blow-drying to provide definition and volume to my very fine hair (which is usually in some kind of bob or layered razor cut with lots of movement).  </li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look stiff or greasy.</li>
      <li>I’ve tried everything in the drug store, and this blows them all away by giving hold and lift - not weighing my fine hair down.</li>
      <li>but the downside is that it&#x27;s slightly oilier, which makes it just a touch heavier on fine hair.</li>
      <li>(though, obviously, judging by the packaging, the product is targeted mainly at men).  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the only thing I have found thus far to replace it.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and this product still works great despite the label saying it&#x27;s for thin hair.</li>
      <li>and I want it &amp;#34;spiked&amp;#34; but not stiff as a board all day long</li>
      <li>Product is same quality, same exact brand and half the price</li>

    <li> It says for men but is the same product I&#x27;ve purchased for women. Great product, especially for short hair. Does not leave your hair weighted down or sticky. Washes out easily. Has a pleasant odor unlike some other paste products. The one drawback is the price--I think it is overpriced for the amount you get. Although you are to use only a small amount, with daily use, it still doesn&#x27;t last long. However, I still pay the price because I like it so much.</li>
    <li> controls the hair in frizzy weather. its not greasy or heavy on the hair. just need to use very little.</li>
    <li> This is my standby backup hair product and is often less expensive than the other, supposedly superior products.  I keep coming back to Architexture.</li>
    <li> I used to have the previous version sold on 4 oz that lasted about an year. For the price I paid for it and the acrylic bling bling fancy packing i&#x27;d expect it to be at least cheaper since it&#x27;s just 1.6 oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ll use the product to try it out and update this.</li>
    <li> I used to use Artec Texture Line Material religiously in my hair until it was discontinued.  After trying several other pomades, I couldn&#x27;t find anything that compared to it until I ran across this product.  It&#x27;s very easy to work into your hair and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling really heavy or greasy, plus the scent is more of a unisex so as a man I don&#x27;t have to worry about the dreaded &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell you get with a lot of hair products.</li>
    <li> Great product at a decent price and arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Like it. It&#x27;s close to what it replaced Material which was my favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it, my clients love it. L&#x27;Oreal is the best from color to styling products they are fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good wax.  If you need to make a &amp;#34;faux hawk&amp;#34; stay or have a pompadour stay; TRY this!  It is pretty strong. It is pricey for a relatively small jar though.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this since my hair is very fine. It has a sticky consistency but it does not look like you have a bunch of junk in your hair because of the matte finish. I put it in after I dry my hair. I’ve tried everything in the drug store, and this blows them all away by giving hold and lift - not weighing my fine hair down. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> It works very similar to the discontinued Artec Material...which i loved.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product going forward.</li>
    <li> I have always bought this hair paste at my local hair salon. It is wonderful for controlling and styling your hair and is good for women as well as men. I am a woman who uses this product every day to keep my hair styled. I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look stiff or greasy. The best part of ordering it here is that it is $7.00 cheaper  and delivered before  the estimated date of delivery. I ordered two at once so I have it on hand. I would  highly rcommend this product and purchase it here.</li>
    <li> I love this product overall but my salon charges me about double for this.  Product is same quality, same exact brand and half the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I bought this product from a local salon in West Hollywood because I wanted to find something that was easily applied to my hair, didn&#x27;t need 3 other products to make it work right, and provided strong hold throughout the day without being sticky or crunchy like waxes or gels. As a longtime fan of Sumotech, the guy at the salon recommended this as a similar product but with better hold and applicability. After using this for a month I have to agree. The smell is nice but not overbearing. Easy to wash out with shampoo. I have thick hair and this product still works great despite the label saying it&#x27;s for thin hair. Works best for me when I apply about a nickel sized amount to my palms, rub my palms together to warm it up, then I work the product through my hair for a few minutes to make sure it&#x27;s evenly distributed.

    <li> Husband uses for his short hair, I use to make my curls last :)</li>
    <li> perfect for styling without being sticky and stiff! I have short hair and I want it &amp;#34;spiked&amp;#34; but not stiff as a board all day long</li>
    <li> Item was delivered in timely manner, all good!</li>
    <li> I used this product before, went to another product and had to come back to this. It offers a great hold while still allowing adjustability. I will continue to use this product for a long time. It works very well with my hair and also has a great scent to it. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best. When styling my fohawk, or spiking my hair it holds up all day no matter what the weather is like. In So Cal this product runs $40.00 each, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere when we moved and the price Amazon amazing!</li>
    <li> The perfect finishing touch</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds $$$$ on this stuff - I used Material for years before it was discontinued and switched to this. NOW I found &amp;#34;Suave Styling Paste&amp;#34; medium which is better than architecture and even closer to material - for $2.50!!!! Try it. You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original &amp;#34;Material&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s the only thing I have found thus far to replace it. It is suffice. Good product.</li>
    <li> It holds my very short hair in place without weighing it down, and the smell is wonderful. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> this is the closest thing to the (sadly!) discontinued artec material line texture wax, which i absolutely LOVED!  for context, i have short to mid-length hair, and i use texture wax after rough blow-drying to provide definition and volume to my very fine hair (which is usually in some kind of bob or layered razor cut with lots of movement).  the old artec material line wax, with its lovely coco-nutty smell and bone-dry texture, was a five star hit with me for many years.  this newer texture expert paste comes pretty close, but it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its predecessor.  i give it a four star rating for two reasons.  first, this paste is a bit softer, which is nice in that it&#x27;s easier to rub into your hands and work into your hair.  but the downside is that it&#x27;s slightly oilier, which makes it just a touch heavier on fine hair. second, while this one smells nice too, its scent is slightly more masculine - a little musky, in fact.  as a woman, i&#x27;d prefer something more androgynous.  (though, obviously, judging by the packaging, the product is targeted mainly at men).  overall, an excellent matte hair paste and the best replacement i&#x27;ve found for the artec so far.</li>
    <li> Best product for fixing hair in place after dried and before spraying.</li>
