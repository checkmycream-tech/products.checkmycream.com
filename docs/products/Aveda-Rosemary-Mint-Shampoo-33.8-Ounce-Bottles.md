      <li>I feel Aveda products are very good quality and love the natural smells.</li>
      <li>Love to wake up to the mint &amp; rosemary scent in the morning.  </li>
      <li>They are really much much better product then this one.</li>
      <li>lovely shampoo, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
      <li>I came here to find if I could buy more and was pleased to see Amazon sells it.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since that time we sampled Aveda&#x27;s Rosemary Mint Shampoo and discovered that we like this variety even more.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>Love the way this shampoo smells.</li>
      <li>I used to enjoy washing with this just for that refreshing scent, and layering the scent by using my Dr. Bronner mint liquid soap (which I still love and use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it smells great and all natural</li>
      <li>The first day I was like - ok - an herby smelling shampoo - not fruit like I&#x27;m used to, but by day 3 I was hooked!</li>
      <li>Clean, refreshing, but not aggressive</li>
      <li>The mint gives your scalp a cool, tingly feeling and it makes my hair very clean and easy to manage.</li>

      <li>If you buy two, you get free shipping.</li>
      <li>It is a great simple cleaning shampoo.</li>
      <li>It cleans very well and it smells so nice.</li>
      <li>It is lightly scented with mint.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gone up in price significantly in a year.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your hair feeling clean and shiny.  </li>
      <li>it felt softer than it had ever been and totally clean.</li>
      <li>Even though its expensive, it works great on my husbands hair (oily) and cleans well while smelling very nice.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this product and it feels nice and tingly in my hair, but it does leave my hair a bit dry.</li>
      <li>I came home and was able to brush it with no tangles and her hair was so so soft!  </li>
      <li>I paid way too much money for something that I can find in cheap products.</li>
      <li>In a pinch, I&#x27;ve even shaved with this \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; with some success.  </li>
      <li>Okay, first of all, if this is a professional brand, why does it contain sulfates?</li>
      <li>It really gives you that \\&quot;clean feeling\\</li>
      <li>And for most of my life the same was also true for the shampoo I used.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this for the clean and the smell.</li>
      <li>Very highly recommended!</li>
      <li>We first ran across it on a Cruise ship, looked all over for it, then found it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I first encountered it in the toiletry kit at a hotel a decade ago.  </li>
      <li>so I never even bothered to sample any of the higher end</li>
      <li>I agree with the first reviewer...</li>
      <li>Although you can purchase smaller size bottles in some locations I would strongly recommend that you purchase these products in the economical 33.8 size.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this shampoo and the way it makes my hair feel...really clean down to my scalp</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite shampoo for a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this Aveda Rosemary Mint Shampoo several times before, although with the smaller bottle directly from the Aveda store, and I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased with the results of a clean, nice smelling, simple shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have relatively short, although fine oily hair.  </li>
      <li>Very highly recommended!So</li>
      <li>/&gt;But if you have normal to oily hair, this could work very, very well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>I use this once in the shower to get my hair clean , unlike some other need to use the shampoo twice to clean the hair</li>
      <li>Much easier to order online than to find a retailer.</li>
      <li>Aveda products are available online, at Aveda stores in malls around the country and from selected local salons.</li>
      <li>But you don&#x27;t need to use too much of it and a bottle this size lasts quite awhile.</li>
      <li>As far as I am concerned Aveda Rosemary Mint Shampoo is worth every penny.    </li>
      <li>As far as I am concerned Aveda Rosemary Mint Shampoo is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>This great for thin hair types not thick..</li>
      <li>This helps keep the cost down to a much more manageable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But, better to buy in local Aveda store since it is about $28 for the same size.</li>
      <li>I highly reccommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have thicker than normal and is longer too.  </li>
      <li>It is better to purchase the product in an Aveda salon or experience center because it is only $35 + tax.</li>
      <li>you see you can teach an old dog new tricks.  </li>
      <li>you see you can teach an old dog new tricks.  </li>
      <li>A little pricey as shampoos go, but a refreshing and invigorating smell -- even for a male!  </li>
      <li>You only needed to use a dab and the shampoo quickly transformed into a rich thick lather.</li>
      <li>Love the product, but is the retailer crazy with 2 1/2 times the price that is available on Aveda&#x27;s website?</li>
      <li>My 5 year old daughter swims 4 days a week.</li>
      <li>A product designer who never tried to actually use the product in real life.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this shampoo and like the way it doesn&#x27;t bog down my fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>The idea of spending more than five or six bucks for a bottle of shampoo seemed ridiculous to me</li>
      <li>As a blonde the chlorine has severly dried her once smooth soft hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why, and there has never been mention of this from Aveda about Rosemary Mint shampoo, but this really works well for getting the yellow out of my white hair.  </li>
      <li>I used the shampoo and conditioner on her hair at the club and was simply amazed and how soft her hair was!  </li>
      <li>If I had more hair on my head, I might complain, as others here do, that it leaves my hair \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; -- but I&#x27;ve not experienced that problem.    </li>
      <li>It is expensive, but it is a nice treat for yourself.</li>
      <li>Everyone sheds a little, but I lost more than just a little hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I found that it&#x27;s too stripping/strong for my very dry frizz-prone hair, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t really add enough conditioning for my needs, ergo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those guys that generally refuses to spend a lot of money on personal care products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have always loved this shampoo.  The mint gives your scalp a cool, tingly feeling and it makes my hair very clean and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> pricey for what I got.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite shampoo for a long time. It is very refreshing, just the thing if you&#x27;re having trouble waking up. Let me offer this advise as to the best place to buy. Go to the Aveda site. They sell the 33.8oz bottles for $29.50, compared to $33 and $39 listed here. If you buy two, you get free shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys that generally refuses to spend a lot of money on personal care products. I usually buy whatever is on sale. That goes for things like toothpaste (Pepsodent), deodorant (store brand) and shaving cream (Barbasol). And for most of my life the same was also true for the shampoo I used. Because I had a dandruff problem when I was younger I started using Head &amp; Shoulders. That stuff is just plain hideous. SInce then I have sampled a whole host of products none of which did a very good job. The idea of spending more than five or six bucks for a bottle of shampoo seemed ridiculous to me so I never even bothered to sample any of the higher end products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago my wife brought home a bottle of shampoo from her hairdresser. This stuff was not cheap and the brand name was one I was unfamiliar with.....Aveda. This was Aveda&#x27;s Clove Shampoo. My wife raved about it and urged me to give it a try. Well I took her advice and discovered that this shampoo was unlike anything I had ever tried. You only needed to use a dab and the shampoo quickly transformed into a rich thick lather. Lo and behold when I rinsed my hair it felt softer than it had ever been and totally clean. There was no soapy residue and two days later no flakes. I was sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that time we sampled Aveda&#x27;s Rosemary Mint Shampoo and discovered that we like this variety even more. This product is \\&quot;formulated with peppermint to awaken your senses and rosemary to help protect from environmental damage.\\&quot; Since I wear my hair rather short I do not require a conditioner but my wife also uses Aveda&#x27;s companion product Rosemary Mint Conditioner and swears by it. Aveda products are available online, at Aveda stores in malls around the country and from selected local salons. Although you can purchase smaller size bottles in some locations I would strongly recommend that you purchase these products in the economical 33.8 size. This helps keep the cost down to a much more manageable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you see you can teach an old dog new tricks.  I found that at least in the case of shampoo you really do get what you pay for.  As far as I am concerned Aveda Rosemary Mint Shampoo is worth every penny.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I first encountered it in the toiletry kit at a hotel a decade ago.  Now I cannot imagine getting up in the morning without this stuff in the shower.  Clean, refreshing, but not aggressive a la Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap, you can use this as a shampoo and an all over body wash -- and you don&#x27;t have to go dizzy and blind trying to read any nutty fine print religio-politico-socio-economico nonsense on the bottle.

    <li> I have relatively short, although fine oily hair.  With other shampoos, my scalp would itch and my hair would look greasy in the late afternoon.  I&#x27;ve used this Aveda Rosemary Mint Shampoo several times before, although with the smaller bottle directly from the Aveda store, and I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased with the results of a clean, nice smelling, simple shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product and it feels nice and tingly in my hair, but it does leave my hair a bit dry.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! It really gives you that \\&quot;clean feeling\\&quot; that you desire. It is better to purchase the product in an Aveda salon or experience center because it is only $35 + tax.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It smells so good. Just wis it was a little less pricey.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Even though its expensive, it works great on my husbands hair (oily) and cleans well while smelling very nice.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old daughter swims 4 days a week. As a blonde the chlorine has severly dried her once smooth soft hair. Because I ran out of her chlorine swimmers shampoo I grabbed the Aveda Rosemary Mint sample bottle I had gotten at a hotel a while back. I used the shampoo and conditioner on her hair at the club and was simply amazed and how soft her hair was!  I came home and was able to brush it with no tangles and her hair was so so soft!  Just like before she took up swimming almost every day. I came here to find if I could buy more and was pleased to see Amazon sells it. I will be ordering it today.</li>
    <li> I agree with the first reviewer...it smells great and all natural but it isn&#x27;t enough for my frizz prone wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this shampoo by a sample we received in an upscale hotel, but was unable to source it locally.  A little pricey as shampoos go, but a refreshing and invigorating smell -- even for a male!  It will help you wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I used to use this shampoo years ago--and still have some of the conditioner that went with it in my linen closet--because my hairdresser used to use it a while back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For folks who like to smell minty, this is wonderful. It cleans very well and it smells so nice. I used to enjoy washing with this just for that refreshing scent, and layering the scent by using my Dr. Bronner mint liquid soap (which I still love and use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found that it&#x27;s too stripping/strong for my very dry frizz-prone hair, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t really add enough conditioning for my needs, ergo, I moved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you have normal to oily hair, this could work very, very well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lovely shampoo, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
    <li> Love the way this shampoo smells. It&#x27;s not inexpensive, but at least you save a bit by buying the larger bottle.  Lasts quite a while!</li>
    <li> Okay, first of all, if this is a professional brand, why does it contain sulfates? That is ridiculous. I paid way too much money for something that I can find in cheap products. I bought mine in a salon, and I am returning it tomorrow for a refund and switching to the brand organix, which I heard works well and you can buy it in the store for only like 5-10 bucks. Anyway, this Aveda product made my hair greasy. It could just be my hair type though maybe, but my hair was greasy, and I noticed I was losing more hair! Everyone sheds a little, but I lost more than just a little hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and am not happy with what it has done. Plus, I think it personally smells a bit like toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is like giovannis shampoo.This great for thin hair types not thick..You can use it on thick but I recommend it for people with thinner texture</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and the way it makes my hair feel...really clean down to my scalp</li>
    <li> Love the Smell - good shampoo. I tried all the others hoping to find a cheaper version but none smelled nearly as good as this.  The first day I was like - ok - an herby smelling shampoo - not fruit like I&#x27;m used to, but by day 3 I was hooked!</li>
    <li> Aveda Rosemary Mint shampoo is a high-quality shampoo. We first ran across it on a Cruise ship, looked all over for it, then found it here on Amazon. We like the feel of it as well as the perfume--easy on my allergy-prone nose.&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent it to me promptly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Cannot read the label in the shower. They are unsure about their product. The smallest print on the label is&amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;.Try reading that without glasses. A product designer who never tried to actually use the product in real life.It could be drain cleaner.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo but you&#x27;ll save a TON of money by just getting it off the Aveda website! This seller is way overpriced.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, and there has never been mention of this from Aveda about Rosemary Mint shampoo, but this really works well for getting the yellow out of my white hair.  So much better than using the weird blueing shampoos.  I haven&#x27;t had much trouble with drying...but I do swim everyday and I think this shampoo helps get the chlorine out as well....</li>
    <li> It is the best for my hair.</li>
    <li> This has been out family shampoo for years. It is a great simple cleaning shampoo. After couple of shampooing, all the oil and dirt are totally gone. Highly recommended. But, better to buy in local Aveda store since it is about $28 for the same size.</li>
    <li> I feel Aveda products are very good quality and love the natural smells.</li>
    <li> Good price &amp; quick ship.</li>
    <li> Love to wake up to the mint &amp; rosemary scent in the morning.  Much easier to order online than to find a retailer.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, very nice suds and great clean fresh hair! What else can you expect from a product. Great.</li>
    <li> I usually get a different type of Aveda but decided to try the Rosemary Mint.  It is nice.  Leaves your hair feeling clean and shiny.  I&#x27;m a little appalled at how expensive this shampoo has become.  It&#x27;s gone up in price significantly in a year.  But you don&#x27;t need to use too much of it and a bottle this size lasts quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this shampoo and like the way it doesn&#x27;t bog down my fine, thin hair.  I have used Aveda products for decades now and though they are expensive, the products are generally worth the money,  I would recommend to anyone seeking a high-quality shampoo, particularly those with fine, thin hair.  Oh, I almost forgot - it&#x27;s fine for color- or chemically-treated hair.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this and I love it it cleans without drying out.  Smells great too.  I use this once in the shower to get my hair clean , unlike some other need to use the shampoo twice to clean the hair and I use styling gel.  I have thicker than normal and is longer too.  Highly recommend this for the clean and the smell.</li>
    <li> I had a gift card for a salon and the sales person recommended the Aveda Rosemary Mint Shampoo. It works great for my hair. My hair is very thick and tends to get oily. It is lightly scented with mint. It is a deep cleansing shampoo. My husband is using it now also. I highly reccommend this product. It is expensive, but it is a nice treat for yourself.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but is the retailer crazy with 2 1/2 times the price that is available on Aveda&#x27;s website? Granted, I did not do enough research, but this is robbery.</li>
    <li> Love this and the product arrived timely and in good condition.  Will definitely plan to order again.</li>
    <li> I really hate this brand now. I brought hair condition and shampoo from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend people to buy Shiseido shampoo and hair condition. They are really much much better product then this one.</li>
