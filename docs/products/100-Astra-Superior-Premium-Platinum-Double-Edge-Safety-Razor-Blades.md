<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My whole family uses these blades and we have been happy with the results.  Now that I&#x27;m not afraid of the blade it actually shaves very closely.  I am glad we switched.</li>
    <li> Chances are, a blade like this was good enough for your grandfather. If that isn&#x27;t reason enough, they also cost a dime apiece - and each one is good for a few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the money you just saved, maybe you can buy a decent set of sheets, or some breath mints.</li>
    <li> A year later and the box is still nearly full.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades for the money I&#x27;ve had the 100 count box for 2 years and still have a lot of blades left. I shave every other day.</li>
    <li> They provide a very close shave. Some of the people who use double edge safety razors claim they can only get 2 shaves out of a blade. I get 5 shaves out of one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse hair and they cut it down with no problem. They work a lot better than the sample Merkur blade that came with my Merkur razor.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good.  Just get them.  Nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lot of 100 blades nearly two years ago. I really think of these as more of a &amp;#34;four and a half:, but I do not want to skew the blade&#x27;s ranking. I would have used more than the fifteen blades (or so) in comparison to the thirty blades of Astra SS until I realized that my face seemed to prefer the SS&#x27;s. I was quickly more tempted to use a SS, but did not experience trouble with the SPs, just less perfect shaves in comparison. I would suggest sampling each as neither are expensive for what one receives. The pillar packaging is cool for storage of other packs of blades as well, I nearly consider it a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; bonus. I shave every day with cold water, for what its worth. Both of these Astras seem to be sufficient for shaving everyday without expecting trouble.</li>
    <li> For the price and the maker, I was at first skeptical but these razors are on par with the more expensive ones.  Excellent price, and love the large quantity.  I am set for years.</li>
    <li> My go to razor, I change them out every shave though.</li>
    <li> These are my current #1 blade choice after sampling about six different brands.  I have used these in two different razors (a mild 1960&#x27;s Gillette Tech and a contemporary Merkur 20C) and seen excellent results in both.  Chances are you&#x27;ll get similar results regardless of your razor choice.  I am able to get at least 3 shaves from each blade, and the overall consistency from blade to blade is exceptional.  There are a couple other blades I&#x27;ve tried that were just as comfortable and consistent, but the Astra SP price point is well below any competitor at the same level of quality.</li>
    <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve used. Have given several to some of my co-workers to try and they love them also. Definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> After trying about 10 different brands and varieties of DE blades, these are my favorite. They shave my fairly coarse beard cleanly without pulling or irritation. I find these very slightly better than the Astra Superior Stainless blades. At this rate, I will spend less than 5 cents a week for blades.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, extremely close shave.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades, they are sharp and get the job done. I use them in my EJ DE89LBl and get 3 shaves with 3 passes per shave. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice blades for the price.</li>
    <li> Blades are really tricky, especially double edge. I actually bought a sample pack that included 10 different brands of blade and out of the 10 - Astra was the best for me. I have thick coarse hair on my face and these blades performed better than the Feather blades I bought. I don&#x27;t get any razor burn and I can use a blade 2-3 times before getting a new one. In fact, given how cheap these blades are - you could use a new one each time.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades for the price.  I usually like feather blades but for the cost these are a great value considering how well they perform.  Only get an occasional cruddy blade that is either duller or had a rough spot who nicks you.</li>
    <li> Safety razors tend to irritate my skin less than the 5 blade razors.  They&#x27;re also extremely cheap to maintain.  I&#x27;d encourage every man to at least try them to see the difference.</li>
    <li> AMAZING performance and AMAZING value. No razor burn, close shave. My husband ordered them and thats what he had to say about them. He also says, he plans to buy them when he runs out, but because the value is so good its going to be awhile before he runs out lol.</li>
    <li> Very smooth blades love them</li>
    <li> Well I guess I&#x27;m just having a blast. I tested the sharpness level of and reviewed  Feather double edge razor blades last week and then turned around and ordered Dorcos,  Derbies, Sharks, Personnas and Gillette Silver Blues.  I already had Astras and Wilkinson Swords on hand so didn&#x27;t need to order them again. I tested again with the same edge sharpness instrument that I had used to test the Feathers. The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon and I may need it if I keep this up. I could describe the test procedure I used and make this review long and drawn out but won&#x27;t bore you with the details.  In a nut shell ;  while there appears to be some very small differences between these  various brands  in initial sharpness levels there isn&#x27;t enough to write about. This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper. Please don&#x27;t shoot the messenger!  I am not a Feather salesman. In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  Please keep in mind also that I tested only one product of each brand so it is possible that other models within the same brand might be sharper (or duller). If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
    <li> TL;DR — These are my go-to blades for great, close shaves at an unbeatable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my review of the blades I&#x27;ve tried. There are a lot of sampler packs on Amazon, but after doing some research I chose to order around 30 each of just a few different blades to try, avoiding all of the lesser-quality &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll compare here and there to Mach-3 blades since that&#x27;s what I previously used before switching to electric, and now this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, Derby is what came with my razor. These you can practically rake across your face any way you see fit. They aren&#x27;t very sharp, on par with a Mach-3 that&#x27;s been used a few times. Shaving requires more strokes which leads to more irritation, especially on the neck. That said, I&#x27;d say these are a good blade if you&#x27;re super worried about cutting yourself, because it&#x27;s practically impossible. But even beginners might want to look elsewhere as these blades kind of ruin the &amp;#34;shaving experience&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t be disappointed if you just bought this razor and have only tried these blades! Keep reading...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a 100-pack of Astra SP Platinum (that&#x27;s Astra Superior Premium Platinum, not the regular stainless) since it&#x27;s under ten bucks at the time of this writing. These are great. Beginners, start here. They&#x27;re sharp enough that you don&#x27;t have to press the razor against your skin—which you shouldn&#x27;t have to! You&#x27;re supposed to let the weight of your razor do the work as you guide it along your face in short strokes. So naturally, these are sharper than Mach-3 blades, but if you do press a little, you probably won&#x27;t nick yourself. I love these blades because for me, they&#x27;re comfortable enough for everyday use and provide good, close shaves at a very inexpensive price. Easy on my neck with care. My go-to blade. Great for beginners and pros alike, and eligible for Subscribe &amp; Save!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilkinson Sword Classic seem to be great blades for people who have their technique down prettywell. Compared to Astra SP Platinum, they are sharper. They provided the best shave of the lot, but I did nick myself here and there on my neck and below my chin the first time around. Do not push these blades against your skin. It doesn&#x27;t take much mastery to use these, and they&#x27;re worth working up to. Downside: more than twice the price of Astra SP Platinum. I&#x27;ll keep some of these around for days when I want the closest shave possible, or I just feel like something different. If you&#x27;re new to traditional shaving or think Mach-3 blades are sharp, maybe don&#x27;t start here, but definitely try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather &amp;#34;New Hi Stainless&amp;#34; Platinum Coated blades are exactly what the reviews say: sharp. My first shave I got a good amount of nicks, but my second I had almost none. I adapted well, and you have to; each brand is a little different and the best require good technique, but some are more forgiving than others. These are negligibly sharper than the Wilkinson Sword Classic but they aren&#x27;t forgiving at all and I didn&#x27;t achieve any better of a shave. They&#x27;re incredibly sharp compared to a Mach-3 blade. At 2x the price of the aforementioned and more than 3x the price of Astra SP Platinum, I won&#x27;t be keeping these on hand, but your mileage may vary. If you only want the sharpest blade around, this is it. Fun fact: these come ten to a pack instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m sticking with Astra SP Platinum for regular use and Wilkinson Sword Classic when I&#x27;m up for something sharper. I shave every other day, and either is priced reasonably enough that if I want, I can use each side of a blade just once for a fresh edge every shave. That&#x27;s about a 100-pack every year, so do the maths on price. Of course, both brands last much longer than this if you&#x27;re looking for even better value.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s the best way to shave shaves so close</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been almost a year, and i&#x27;m not even halfway through this box. i&#x27;m never going back to the new-school razors!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me about 2 years to arrive to these wonderful pieces of heaven and my only regret is not finding them faster. I have very thick hair and the aforementioned blades ranged from uncomfortable (Feather) to painful (AM/PM.) These are the first blades that cut without an uncomfortable pulling sensation, and the best part is that they&#x27;re cheap to boot.</li>
    <li> I doubt my husband will ever go back to disposable razors again. With his safety razor and these blades he is really happy. He gets a close, huggable shave too.</li>
    <li> Cheap and for me, the performance is on par with persona medical preps. The sharpness of a blade isn&#x27;t the seller for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the smoothness and level of comfort provided. Don&#x27;t misunderstand. These blades are extremely sharp. Just as sharp as feather, however they wont pull and burn you like the overrated and underperforming feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also much cheaper. If a product is better in terms of comfort, equal in terms of sharpness, and far cheaper, that has my vote. Astra is by far the BEST blade on the market for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enclosed is a picture of the razor this blade goes In. So go ahead and question my claim on the sharpness of this blade :p</li>
    <li> The title says it all. This is a good blade. It&#x27;s very smooth and mild and gives a reasonably close shave.  I had previously used feather blades which are sharper and do give a closer shave but they cut me quite a bit especially if I use them every day. These blades are also a very good price which makes them very affordable for every day use.  I&#x27;ve moved to using these as my every day blade and using feathers when I need a particularity close shave for a date night or special occasion.</li>
    <li> Shaving is an experience for my husband. He uses real razors, pre-shave oil, real shave cream and brush, and a post-shave lotion with his Milbourn razor.  These razor blades replaced the Milbourn razors that were a part of our subscribe and save purchases.  When Amazon stopped carrying those blades, we ordered these as replacement (as suggested by Amazon)  I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so they (apparently) work just as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating these a 5 because for whatever reason they are about the only double edge blades I&#x27;ve found that do a great job on my beard.  Maybe it&#x27;s my technique, maybe it&#x27;s my razor, maybe it&#x27;s my preparation, I don&#x27;t know, but other blades destroy my face.  These do not.  For that reason I will always use these.</li>
    <li> I love these so much.  And since it&#x27;s so inexpensive, I change out the blades every week.  Good for facial shaving or if you shave your head.</li>
    <li> Both my Wife and I use these blades.  We had some other brand for the last year, but these ones seem to not cut me as often and seem to cut the hair really smooth. Will be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the worst blades I&#x27;ve ever used. You need to pass 4-5 time to cut all your beard. After two uses you just won&#x27;t be able to shave at all. going back to german blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an assortment of blades recently while trying out safety razors. So far I&#x27;ve liked the Lord Platinum the best, and these the least due to sharpness. Even the store brand razors purchased locally had a better edge. But, given the price of these, they can be a one-use object and still cost less than disposables. I&#x27;d just suggest going with one of the other super cheap 100 packs that amazon has to offer.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy, fit my safety razor well, very sharp, packaging is neat and easy to open.  Overall, just whaat I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I recommend this because they are good cuality, word the price, and this packet bring enough for a long season.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other blades, so I can&#x27;t really compare them to any others.  They are thin and sharp, fit well in my Safety Razor, and cut hair.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> These blades are great for the new wetshaver. Nice mid-range aggressiveness (not too aggressive, or sharp, and not too mild either). My go-to blades. And at 10 cents a blade, you can&#x27;t beat the price. The first razor I used lasted me about 7 shaves, or about 15 passes. But I shave head and beard. If I were shaving face only, it would have lasted a lot longer. But remember, your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a month in on these razors and I&#x27;ve very satisfied. They have lasted me one week apiece, and do a great job of providing a close, clean shave. 5/5, will buy again in two years when the box runs out.</li>
    <li> Terrible blades; dull, wear easily.</li>
    <li> these blades are a fantastic deal. they work nicely. only complaint is the large wax spots they use to adhere the blade to the paper.  i prefer less wax on my blades.</li>
    <li> I have a very stiff beard and need really sharp blades, these don&#x27;t do the trick. They work OK the first time but then not after that. Even if I soften the beard well and use plenty of lather and lube it does not help. I have basically given up using these kinds of razors and went back to the expensive plastic ones.</li>
    <li> So many blades for such a low price. I use one blade a week with daily shaving. They&#x27;re good quality blades.</li>
    <li> Paired these with my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and my whiskers are a thing of the past. It seriously doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m shaving, they&#x27;re so smooth. Of course, every man&#x27;s face is different so what works for me might not work for you so I would suggest buying less than 100 blades until you find yours but this brand is definitely worth a shot. The price to performance ratio is absolutely outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the glue on the blades controversy; please don&#x27;t worry. It&#x27;s not glue, it&#x27;s a light wax. It&#x27;s there so the blades won&#x27;t move around in their packages and potentially dull the edge. It doesn&#x27;t affect the shave whatsoever and I don&#x27;t even bother scraping it off. About three seconds under hot water and it&#x27;s gone anyway (I soak my razor in hot water for longer than three seconds before I shave!) so don&#x27;t worry about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is there&#x27;s no little slot on the packages to put old razors in that a lot of other blade manufacturers use. You have to do the ol&#x27; wrap in toilet paper and into the trash routine to dispose of the blades. Not a big deal but I would prefer my used blades to be safely tucked away in a little cardboard container before I put them into the trash. Oh well, small trade off for a blade that works as well as this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different DE blades - Astra, Derby, various Personna, tons of different Gillettes, Treet, Wilkinson, Merkur, Bic, Feather, and I&#x27;m almost certainly forgetting others. Astra wins in my book as far as a budget blade is concerned. My top blades are the Gillette Silver Blue and the Personna Medical Prep, but the Astras are not far behind, and they are considerably cheaper. My razor is a Tradere OC, and with certain blades, one side will break before the blade dulls. This is certainly related to multiple factors, but if you&#x27;ve experienced this with other blades, know that the Astras probably will as well. This translates to running through blades more quickly (which ultimately means cost is increased) but again, heavily dependent on razor, etc. I shave a lot of my body, and I use my razor to trim other bits, and as far as getting a smooth shave and keeping nicks down, I would definitely recommend these for the price and availability. If you can spring for a bit more money, and aren&#x27;t as worried about convenience, better choices can likely be had from shaving shops.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!  Great blades, great price!</li>
    <li> These are the best safety razor blades I have used.  I sampled quite a few in a 100 pack sampler as well.  I&#x27;ll never purchase another brand.  Great price and a great shave.</li>
    <li> OK, yes, the little drops of goo on the blade from the wax wrapping is annoying, but it takes like seven seconds to remove with rubbing alcohol. Suck it up. For the price and quality of the blade (once it&#x27;s clean), I haven&#x27;t found a better value. I won&#x27;t be buying blades for a couple years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the Double Edge razor scene. After shaving with Gillette Fusion since I began shaving, I wanted to try something new. After seeing the Merkur 180 razor on a review of Father&#x27;s Day presents, I decided on buying one for myself. Along with it, I bought these blades. First thing, these blades are insanely cheap. 100 for $10 is a price that can&#x27;t be beat. I change the blade every other shave, but I don&#x27;t worry about running out of blades any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read reviews, people say that when using a Double Edge razor, they get the closest shave they ever had, compared to other high-priced razor cartridges. I believe it all depends on the blade really, and for me, these blades don&#x27;t do the trick. Compared to a Gillette Fusion blade, there is a noticeable difference. You can see and feel the difference. (Sometimes after shaving with this blade, I redo my shave with a Fusion blade). I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my technique, face structure, or the blade, but I just can&#x27;t seem to get as close as I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you have yet to experience this blade, give it a shot. It&#x27;s cheap so It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re throwing your money away.</li>
    <li> These are simply the best of the brands of razor blades I&#x27;ve used over the years.  They offer an ideal combination of sharpness and smoothness that beats all others!  And the price is a steal, so don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
    <li> Didnt worked for me, wasnt sharp enough as others have pointed !! Can only use once plus it doesnt give me a close shave</li>
    <li> I bought 100 for around $11 and they seem to work very well, although I have just recently started using safety razors and have only tried one other kind of razor, the one cheap one that came with the safety razor I bought. Although I don&#x27;t know much about the different products available as far as blades go, I will be buying these again because they work well and definitely are at a great price.</li>
    <li> sharp, sturdy, individually wrapped, inexpensive blades.  I usually cut mine in half and use them in my straight razor.  These are cheap enough that I keep a couple by the door to open mail and will even grab one for precision cuts while cooking.</li>
    <li> Love these. I will never buy disposables again. Safety razors all the way.</li>
    <li> These blades are definitely the truth and stay sharper than any blade I&#x27;ve used for a client during a shave and can do a full beard or hairline with one razor!</li>
    <li> These blades have been some of the best of the 10+ brands I have tried.  Consistent, sharp (not too sharp), long lasting, and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Very effective, I replace my blade about once a week which makes my shaving cost about $0.10 a week.  Excellent results with minimum cost!</li>
    <li> This makes shaving enjoyable, and affordable&lt;br /&gt;One blade lasts about 2 weeks if I shave everyday&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 20 small cartons of 5 razors which is rather convenient</li>
    <li> Good Quality for the price.  I ordered two boxes of these and have been using them daily since I went back to a single blade safety razor.  Yes, I bought into the Lie that multiple blades are better....they are not.  It was only a way to soak the consumer for more money by selling multiple blades at outrageous prices.  The straight razor is still rated as the giving best shave possible and I have never seen a straight razor with multiple blades. The Europeans are smarter in this regard, they are still using single blade safety razors.</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave ever!</li>
    <li> Best. Blades. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp. Handle carefully. Hubby says it takes some practice, but when you get it down they are a great shave.</li>
    <li> I originally got these blades because you get a lot for a little. After using them for a couple of months I am quite happy with their quality.&lt;br /&gt;The blades consistently fit snug into my safety razor. They seem to be quite a bit sharper than other blades of similar price but not quite as sharp as the Feather blades I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I am easily and comfortably getting 3+ shaves from each blade.</li>
    <li> Compared to other brands, these are just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the store advertises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100 blades are subdivided into mini-packs, each of which contain 5 individually wrapped blades. Very handy for taking on-the-road.</li>
    <li> These are the first blade I tried in my safety razor. I&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric shaver since I was a kid (25+ years). I decided to upgrade to gramdpa&#x27;s shaver. I shaved for a month on an Astra blade then went to a Murkur blade. Murker blade seemed dull, it draggd and pulled. After that I went back to my month old blade and couldn&#x27;t believe I was really shaving hairs off. I thought I had the angle wrong because shaving was so freaking smooth. Now I&#x27;m finished with a good shave. Shaving is fun with Astar again</li>
    <li> While many blade brands are dull right out of the box such that they drag and pull, and others so aggressive as to slice up my face, these are a good compromise. They easily slice through the whiskers but not my skin. This is with a Merkur Barber Pole long-handled razor. If you wish for a more assertive blade, Feather is the ultimate, but they cut me terribly. The Astra blade will usually last me three shaves before beginning to dull. The price is right also.</li>
    <li> These are among the best razors I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried Merkur, Shark, and other brands, and I find myself reaching for these every time I want a good shave. The individual packs inside the box are cardboard, and each blade is wrapped in a waxy paper. It should seal the moisture out well enough, but it may be a concern to some buyers. The blades themselves are fantastic, and very sharp. I&#x27;ve used them for 2-3 shaves before. If you&#x27;re not sure which blades to get (there are so many brands out there), I would recommend going with Astra. I will be buying this brand again as my #1 choice in the future.</li>
    <li> Just Tried Some Of These In A Sample Pack  Put simply they are the best &#x27;Non-Gillette&#x27; blade I&#x27;ve found as they are good and sharp but wont cut you unless you really do something stupid.  So far they are the best blade in the sample pack tho the Gillette Super Platinum is a close second.  Still just for the price and the quality I&#x27;d have to buy Astras.  And only at AMAZON.........  A satisfied customer.  IndianaED</li>
    <li> Best bang for the buck in terms of sharpness and price</li>
    <li> These are not as sharp or long lasting as I&#x27;d hoped. It takes me 2 blades to finish the job. I shave my head and face, and I&#x27;ve had a better shave with other blades.</li>
    <li> Better than merkur razor blades.  Have not compared to feather yet.</li>
    <li> A great deal and very effective blades.</li>
    <li> Blades are blades and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly in my double edged razor. I go through at least three shaves before I replace them. These can even last me all year! With the price, I feel like it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> Great and cheap! They do what they were designed to do.</li>
    <li> Excellent blade in combination with Nutragena shave gel. I have a very coarse beard.The Astra  gave me a two day shave with no nicks and left my skin smooth without chafing. Shower, gel shave ,gel shave. that&#x27;s it. excellent blades this combination works well.</li>
    <li> New to DE shaving, I bought these blades with a new razor.  The razor came with Shark Super Chrome blades.  After using those for three weeks and beg somewhat disappointed, I put one of these in and the change in comfort was huge. Much less irritation and no pulling like a cartridge. And a bonus, given that&#x27;s almost two years worth of blades for $10!</li>
    <li> great shave ...great value</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to buying 10$ razor cartridges after shaving with a safety razor. It does take a bit of practice when shaving my legs but it&#x27;s so worth the quality of the shave and the cost. I can use a new blade every time I shave my legs and not feel bad about it. These blades are sharp and really nice.</li>
    <li> I had Shark blades before these, and these are by far the better of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible superior blade would be the Japanese Brand, Feather.</li>
    <li> This is the &amp;#34;Stoli Elite&amp;#34; of double edge blades</li>
    <li> If you have a thick beard and sensitive skin, these are the blades for you.  Strong enough to cut a bear in half but as gentle as Ra&#x27;z Al Ghul&#x27;s destiny.</li>
    <li> Did not realize how dull a Derby blade was until I bought the Astra Platinums.  These blades actually cut facial hair and are no less as sharp after multiple shaves.  Wish I had bought these blades sooner.</li>
    <li> I use these blades everyday, I read one review where someone said these are counterfeit blades cause they are wrapped in white wax paper. These are the real deal.   You can tell a sharp blade by the way it cuts into your fingernail. When it cuts in smoothly and glides along its a sharp blade.   The one thing I do notice with these blades is that you need to have a nice slick lather on your face to get best possible shave.   I have used and tried many different types and brands of blades and these are definitely my favorite and definitely top quality.  Update, I decided to buy 100 feathers and 100 personna med prep blades.. So I put the Asta blades aside and used these other blades the past few months. This week I pulled out a Asta blade and honestly was surprised these blades are just as sharp. Love feeling how smooth my face is after these. You know what they say ymmv but with good technique and properly prepped face Astra is top notch one of the best.</li>
    <li> Quality in the blades are mixed to say the least. Other than that 95% of the blades are awesome.</li>
    <li> Not the best blades out there but for the price this product definitely deserves consideration.  I need to use a preshave product to make these blades work for me.  Again, the price per blade make these a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I see why these are so popular and a baseline of comparison for so many people - they simply do a great job consistently. Of course, ymmv.</li>
    <li> These are very mild blades. I use them in the winter when my skin dries out as they are extremely tame. These are good for those months and for newbies getting used to shaving with a DE razor. They begin dulling on the second use and for those who hack away at their faces will find that it helps with nicking. As a lifelong feather blade fan I doubt I could switch to these full time, but they do help in the cold months when the weather is drying out skin.</li>
    <li> Really good blades and really cheap too</li>
    <li> These blades cut through short hairs nicely, but give a touch of tug on medium hairs.  I have not had a lot of nicks, less than 1 a week, and chalk that up to my technique.  I use about one blade per 7 shaves.</li>
    <li> Great razors that last a while and with so many in a box for so cheap you can change your razor every week for almost a couple years and not have to worry about buying more.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have already stated, different blades perform differently for different people. That said, these blades worked great for me. The shave is excellent - not nearly as many nicks as other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At less than a dime a pop, Astras are a no brainer - just buy them.</li>
    <li> just a little too sharp. put them in a n ancient Gillette adjustable or you will use up your styptic pencil.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best buy for the money.If you like sharp blades try these,they are made the same place as Gillet blades.</li>
    <li> My go to blade. Sharp, smooth and last longer than some of the others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wilkinson Sword blades...used to get them from Wal mart, I find these blades to work a little better. The box of 100 lasts me probably a year...maybe a little longer. I haven&#x27;t tried Feathers or others yet....I&#x27;ll stick with these for now and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price. I clean and rotate after each use, this 100 box will last me probably 3 years or more. Hundreds of dollars saved compared to multiple-blade razors.</li>
    <li> These are sharp blades and for the price are excellent, but they are inexpensive and you can feel that in the consistency. All are better than what you&#x27;ll get down at the drug store or Target, but it is very minimal packaging. I was looking for inexpensive, so for me they are perfect. I&#x27;d give them 5 stars, but wanted to give a heads up to those expecting tip top quality.</li>
    <li> After trying a [[ASIN:B003OL2LHC 24 FEATHER BLUEBIRD DERBY GILLETTE ASTRA TREET Blades Sampler]], I found these Astras to be the right balance for daily use (for me). I ordered this 100-pack and am generally satisfied with it, but as mentioned in another review, the blades are incompletely wrapped in wax paper and dabs of glue are used to make up the difference. The glue is often right on the edge of the blade, making the blade stick to the razor when trying to remove after use - a potential safety risk. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in performance, but it seems the glue would collect shaving gunk and make it harder to rinse off... all of this could be avoided if they&#x27;d just wrap the blades properly and not use glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, these are my daily blades and they work well enough for the price. They&#x27;re sharp enough for a close shave, but not so sharp I have to be wide awake and extra-careful to avoid cuts. I use Feather blades if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days, but for daily use these Astras are fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the other Astras were NOT as good for me, only Astra Superior Premium Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My list of Amazon-acquired shaving gear:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor #38 + 10 Free DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000F5NRQY Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Pre-Shave Oil, 2 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RG8D6K Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00020UQQQ Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Shave Cream Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004COMB5W Osma Styptic Pencil, Hemo Stop]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
    <li> Wicked Sharp. So sharp you can cut hairs off your face.</li>
    <li> The price of this item is the lowest, but it&#x27;s not worth purchasing. The back of these blades are secured to the waxed paper with 4 dots of sticky gum that&#x27;s disgusting and clogs the razor up. These are junk and unusable. Purchase the Shark razors instead. They&#x27;re a much higher quality.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades. Great price. Sure as hell beats cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> These were the first blades I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I&#x27;m so happy I went with this brand. Each blade will last around 3-5 shaves. Depending on the thickness of your hair and how sharp you need the blades to be. On a scale of 1-5 for sharpness, I&#x27;d give these a solid 4. If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving, they wont tear your face up. If you&#x27;re old friends with your smart razor, you can shave pretty fast with these blades and not worry about cutting yourself. I definitely get more brave after the 3rd shave I&#x27;ve gone through with the same blade. I&#x27;m sure you could use them more than 5 times, but at this price, just throw on a new blade and stop being cheap. For roughly 10 cents a blade, you cant beat that deal. It better than your Mock 3, Quatro, or 5 blade system you&#x27;ve used in the past. Just remember, this is 1 blade and you may have to take multiple passes. That 1 blade will be less stress on your face because you wont be running 5 consecutive blades across your face over and over. Give it some time, you&#x27;ll learn to love it and never look back. If you liked my review, check out my reviews on other shaving products.</li>
    <li> Very good value for the money.  Blades are very much YMMV items, but for me these blades work great in all my razors.  I get 3, 3 pass shaves with them and at the cost (this order was 9.99) that is 10 months of shaving at less than 1 dollar a month, hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Merkur blades since I started DE shaving, with some occaisional Wilkenson Sword blades thrown in from time to time as well. This was my first time trying these Astra blades, but with such great reviews, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed them. They&#x27;re not NEARLY as harsh as the Merkur blades (which I&#x27;ve since decided I don&#x27;t care for), and about on par with the Wilkenson Swords I was using. However, the WS blades were 5 for $1.50 at the local store. These are a much better deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also seem to last about an additional shave. Usually I rotate blades strictly after 2 shaves, noting a decrease in performance. The third shave with these was as pleasant as the first. I usually rotate them out after 3 shaves, but I&#x27;m sure a 4th wouldn&#x27;t be the end of the world. (I perform 3-4 passes on each shave, for the record)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying these again when I run out, but that&#x27;ll take about a year at the rate I&#x27;m using them.</li>
    <li> These are good blades, like the rest derby, shark, feathers, darco ST301  I just wanted to try them out,   they gave me a close shave no nicks, cuts or abrasions  I would buy them again, there made in Russia, nothing fancy  they were 15.49 with shipping  they are a little duller than derby and shark, definatly duller than feathers  close to equaly dull like darco ST301 but I like a duller blade since I shave  every day, feathers are too sharp for me, so are the sharks  I would but them again if I get a good deal</li>
    <li> I went through a blade sampler pack from TryABlade and found that these Astas were the best for me.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, and it&#x27;s a nice smooth shave.  I pair this with a Merkur 25C.  Definitely recommend trying out a bunch of different blades before you buy bulk.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve used to far.  I have a very tough beard and can rarely get multiple uses out of razors like I do with these.</li>
    <li> Best value on the market.</li>
    <li> I had originally bought 5 different brands of Double Edge razor blades from a shaving store on the West Coast to see which ones I liked best. Of the 5 I picked out which included Feather, Lord (platinum and stainless), Dorco, Derby , and the Astra. The Feathers were the sharpest and the next ones I liked were the Lords and the Astra. I decided to go with the Astra&#x27;s because of the cost. These blades I got from Amazon just did not seem like the ones I got from the shaving store. Very inconsistent from one blade to another. Another reviewer who also gave this a one star said he thinks these are not true Astra&#x27;s. He mentioned that the true Astra&#x27;s are individually wrapped with paper saying Astra while these which he also mentioned are in plain white paper. I cannot verify this since I have used all my original Astra blades from the shaving store to see if the paper did have Astra written on the paper surrounding the blade. Another theory I had was that Astra was owned by Gillette and made in Russia. Proctor and Gamble bought Gillette and I have wondered if they have cut down on the quality. Again just a theory on my part, but I felt the quality on the Trac 3 blades went down in quality after the P &amp; G purchase of Gillette which made me change to using double edge blades. I do not know if the original purchase from the shaving store was pre P &amp; G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades were just not the same as  my original Astra blades. I am finally down to my last 20 blades and looking to purchase another 100 blades and it will definitely not be these blades. In fact I am thinking I will buy them from a shaving store just to be safe.</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades to shave every day for about a month. They last about 10-14 days before they need to be replaced but at .10 cents per blade I discard them weekly. These are solid every day use razors.</li>
    <li> I change the blades about every four shaves.  Saving a lot of money and getting the same shave, no brainer.</li>
    <li> Sharp, clean and cheap.</li>
    <li> Loves these blads and lasts a long time for the price, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My favorite blade for a smooth shave even on my sensitive skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> These blades are extremely sharp, and at around 10 cents per blade (I paid ~$10), this is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> 100 blades, compatible with 99% of safety razors, all for $10. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Great price, very sharp and if you store the blade you are using in alcohol they seem to last a lot longer</li>
    <li> These are possibly the worse blades I have ever used, please you can read the other reviews and take a chance but you will see what I mean when you use that first one and you will wish you listened to this review, spend the money and buy Feather or Merkur.</li>
    <li> Whether you choose Astras or another brand, I highly recommend shaving with a DE razor. A one-time cost of around $25 for a solid razor, then 100 blades (of a reputable brand) at around $15 make this cheaper after just three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I am very happy with the Astra Platinum DE blades. I compulsively researched blades before I ordered these. I knew I didn&#x27;t need extra-sharp blades like Feathers, and I knew to avoid any store-brand blade found in supermarkets or drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out of Astras, which I imagine will be in three years, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I tried several sampler packs of blades before choosing these as my everyday blade in my Parker 22R.  They are great for sensitive skin, I have problems with irritation unless I use a straight razor or single blade.  They also seem sharper and smoother than Derby blades to me.  Almost as sharp as the Feather blades, but don&#x27;t leave my face bleeding like they sometimes do.  One blade easily lasts me 6 shaves.  Do yourself a favor and ditch the expensive multi-blade gimmicks and treat youself to a real shave.</li>
    <li> I agree that ASTRA stainless double edge blades fit all double edge razors. ASTRA blades are made from the highest quality steel. Each ASTRA blade provides unsurpassed quality, smoothness and durability for a long lasting, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great blade for my neck and face.  No nicks or cuts and still a close shave.  It took awhile to find the right blade for my double edge but ASTRA is it.  Each package is a years worth of shaving.</li>
    <li> Great value. I am not a man of much facial hair, but I use 1/2 a blade every two shaves. I think they&#x27;re regular size shaving blades. The ones barbers use.</li>
    <li> Great shave much better than the wilkinson blades at the store.</li>
    <li> Great Price great quality</li>
    <li> Super sharp but forgiving blades</li>
    <li> I love these blades, the quality really shows with the upward strokes. I don&#x27;t get cuts or razor burns.    Long live the Double Edge Safety Blades! Down with the conglomerate exploiters!</li>
    <li> Like many before have written, all razor blades are not the same for every person. Personally, these blades do not as well as others work for me, but that is no fault of the blades. They are just not for my facial hair. The blades are of the highest quality, are packaged well in (paper!) packs of 5.  Do yourself a favor and purchase a sample pack in order to try out a few different types. If that sampler tells you that the Astras are your blade of choice, then by all means purchase this item. You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> you get 20 tiny boxes of 5 razors each. There are no problems with this item as far as I can tell, it is exactly as promised and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have not finished using all 100 blades in this pack after about 2 years. They worked really well for me on my face and my head. Each blade was consistently made and sharp.</li>
    <li> As someone my age, 27, who just started DE Shaving a few months ago these are the best blades I have found for myself. I have mildly sensitive skin, and besides using natural soaps, I have found that these blades when used correctly with the right soap don&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. DE shaving takes practice like anything else but I get a closer shave then using the overpriced cartridge razors. Here are a few tips if you are new to DE Shaving: get a good shaving brush because without a good lather on your face your more likely to irritate the skin and cut yourself, invest in a good DE Razor (since they last a very long time) and finally find the right soap that will provide a good lather on your face while also moisturizing it.</li>
    <li> I tried with a sample pack. These worked best for my face.  It shaves better than all the cartridge blades out there.  I have tried them all.  Funny how a single blade works the best.  Make sure you try a sample pack first.  They are all different.</li>
    <li> I found the Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge blades to be superior to Derby and Merkur, but still short of Feather in sharpness and consistency from one blade to another.  I don&#x27;t get the dug against my beard whiskers I do with Derby, nor do I get the irritation I get from some other blades when shaving my head, but they do not seem as sharp as Feather.  I also find about every third or fourth blade seems to bite, which is what I mean about consistency.  All in all, good blades, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;I used these in a Merkur 23C Long Handle and a Merkur 37C HD Slant.</li>
    <li> Great blades.  I bought these for my Merkur 20C.  There are many blades I have not tried so I can&#x27;t say these are the best over all but they are the best I have tried to date.  They are just as comfortable on two to three days growth as they are when shaving every day.</li>
    <li> There may be better blades, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat them.  Smooth.  I have thick hair and get about 4 shaves per blade.  Glad to be using DE razor again for a change.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, close cut. Works for about 4 to 5 shaves for me. This pack will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased these blades on sale, and was a little hesitant doing so considering I had never used them before.  Previously I used Merkur blades.  I am very pleased with this blade, and prefer it over the Merkur.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  Even still, it&#x27;s usually preferred to try before you buy such a large pack.</li>
    <li> I have used all kind of blades, Feather, Murker, Wegmen&#x27;s and many other sold on Amazon. I think finally i have found the one that works for me. I guess it all depends on skin, I have very sensitive skin and found Astra the best for my type of skin and for the price they are even better. Many people talk about Feather being the best. But I always had a burning sensation after shaving with Feather blades, that&#x27;s not the case with ASTRA. I will not use anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> It amazes me how great these blades are for the price. I use all different brands that I like. Also use the Astra SS blades which are great. I think this is a great buy. I use them 3 times and could probably use them longer but they are so cheap to buy in bulk I don&#x27;t push it. Every face is different and I would buy a sampler pack of DE blades first then your can find the right blades for you.</li>
    <li> Just started DE shaving again after a nearly 30 year hiatus.  I wanted to \\&quot;beat\\&quot; the excessive cost of those $3 to $4 5-blade plastic gizmos that they advertise heavily.  Thes blades cost me about $0.20 each.  With a decent DE shaver you can easily get 4 to 7 shaves out of each blade.  And, you can get as good a shave, if not a better shave, as well.  Being back \\&quot;new\\&quot; in the DE shave game, I have not tried that many blades.  My new DE shaver came with a Merkur blade.  I tried it and did not like it.  I bought a small pack of Wilkinson blades at the drug store.  Those blades gave me an acceptable shave...much better than my Merkur blade.  But these Astra blades are by far better than either of the other two I have tried thus far.  I plan to try some other blades (Feather, Derby, Persona, etc.) but I can see that these Astras are definitely \\&quot;keeper\\&quot; blades.    The vendor provided prompt service and I would definitely buy products from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> These blades are, simply, great! The edge lasts through several shaves.  Best I&#x27;ve tried, to date.</li>
    <li> The best shaves ever. I paired the Astra razor with my Edwin Jagger De89lbl and I have gotten the best shaves of my entire life. At .10 cents on a blade you have to give it a try. I&#x27;m a firm believer in the adage of \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; but believe me it DOES NOT apply here.  This is one of those rare moments where you get way more than you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at the risk of sounding like an a$$ what sold me was that I saw the writing on the package and I&#x27;m not certain which language the writing it is in, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is from a region where our brothers are a bit more on the swarthy side. You know what? It was a good call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting 3 shaves per blade. That&#x27;s nearly a whole year&#x27;s worth of shaves for just over 10 bucks. In my book that&#x27;s a deal.</li>
    <li> Work great, sharp just the right amount</li>
    <li> My brother turned me on to these blades about a year ago. I&#x27;ve tried the cheap walmart blades, they never did it for me. These astra blades are in my opinion the best blades you can get. At this price they can&#x27;t be beat. 100 good blades for that much, mach 3 and fusion don&#x27;t even hold a candle to that. I get a closer shave with these too. I would highly recommend these blades and the razor that takes them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like these blades.  They are a good compromise between harshly sharp expensive blades and the less sharp but more forgiving cheap blades like Derby and Dorco.</li>
    <li> I purchased a few sampler packs when I began shaving with dual edge safety razors last year.  These Astra blades were by far my favorite.  I&#x27;ll occasionally dip into my remaining sampler packs to see if my improved technique will affect their shave; these remain my favorite.    Smoothness: 8  - I haven&#x27;t tried a feather blade yet.  Every review I&#x27;ve read indicates they&#x27;d beat the Astra.  These are the smoothest I&#x27;ve actually used. My skin is fairly sensitive and I get razor burn easily.  My Gillette Fatboy (settings 1-9, 9 being most aggressive) ranged between 1 and 4 depending on the razor.  It&#x27;s set to 3 for these and I can do two passes (1 with grain, 1 across) without any burn or bumps.    Sharpness:  7  -  The edge on these is nice though I don&#x27;t get the &#x27;hot knife through butter&#x27; that I see on the feather blades.  After the second pass I&#x27;m about as smooth as I could get by a mach 3 against the grain (that led to razor burn though so I never went across or against with the mach).    Durability: 7-8  - I can stretch a blade out to 2 weeks before it starts tugging.  At ten bucks for 100 I don&#x27;t try to push it and instead just change out the blade every Sunday.  My facial hair is pretty rough and I&#x27;ve used some blades (sharky) that have lasted two shaves before needing replacement.    Cost:  10 -  $10 for 100 blades?  Sign me up.  At 1 blade per week that gives me ~23 months.    These blades are the winner for me.  Though I&#x27;m sure there are sharper blades out there, these are sharp enough and durable enough for a sophomore wet shaver like myself.  I will eventually give feathers a try if/when the price difference is smaller.  As of right now they are around five times as expensive and as good a shave as I&#x27;m getting now I really can&#x27;t see a justification for it.    Current setup:  Gillette Fatboy w/ Astra Sup. Prem. Plat.  Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood soap  (http://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Old-Bond-Street-Sandalwood/dp/B00158S4RM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1338213098&amp;sr&#x3D;1-5 )  Tweezerman Shaving Brush  (http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-2801-h-Mens-Shaving-Brush/dp/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1338213034&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1  )</li>
    <li> For most of my last 20 years I have used only Gillette cartridges and gels for daily shaving. They were fine and worked well. Over time I have seen their cartridges go from 1 blade to 5 now in the Fusions. For some reason paying $4 per blade always irritated me. It is not logical irritation but it is there nonetheless. I can imagine the product marketing guys sitting around a table and laughing at getting consumers to pay 4 bucks a blade. The irritation began growing and about 8-10 years back I switched to electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric razors are (probably) the most convenient and cost effective solution for shaving. Oddly enough I don&#x27;t shave with it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year ago on a lark I bought a safety razor from Amazon and Feather blades. I bought this when the Feather blades ran out. I use about 3 blades/week of the Astras; note I do shave my head also 2-3 time a week. The feathers are definitely sharper. I was 1-2 blades every week; to compare I was going through 1 blade of the Gillette Fusions a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about the Astras is that their edges are numbered so use edge 1-2 the first day and 3-4 the next. Feather should do that also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have an unopened 4-pack of Gilette Fusions lying in the bathroom. When I travel I take my electric otherwise I use the safety razor every day. As a shave it is harder to shave with it than with the Fusions. I have to be careful or I will nick myself specially when I do my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think using safety razors is for everybody but I now do enjoy shaving specially with a good soap. I wouldn&#x27;t use the Gillette Fusions if I got paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this year I may treat myself to an expensive razor and brush. Shaving is now no longer a chore but an experience I look forward to every morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Astras every day for a few months now, and they&#x27;re my favorite DE blade. Not as sharp as Feathers, not as dull as Derbys, good for 4 or 5 shaves, and really affordable. Some complain about the glue spots on the blade, but I haven&#x27;t found this to be a problem. While I haven&#x27;t sampled the entire universe of DE blades, I imagine it would be tough to find a better performance/price combo.</li>
    <li> These cut smoother than my Wilkinson Swords.</li>
    <li> These are great blades at a great price. They are extremely sharp and provide a truly smooth shave for several days or longer. The wax dots are my only gripe: they don&#x27;t detract from performance at all but I am faced with occasional cleaning of wax build up on the interior of the razor when swapping out blades.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. The blades come in 10 blade boxes I think and stay sharp for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love these blades- have been using Derby for years but tried these and really like how smooth they are.  I use them in a Merkur razor.</li>
    <li> I am a beginner in the luxurious world of double edged razor blade shaving with a safety razor.  I initially purchased a razor blade sampler pack, and found that these Astra&#x27;s are among the smothest blades I&#x27;ve shaved with.  I know quite a few people love their Derbys, but, I prefer these blades because not only are they smooth but they are also very forgiving if you have sensitive skin like me.  My shave set up includes Art of Shaving lavender shaving cream and a Merkur Progress safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick up these blades - you really can&#x27;t go wrong as they will give you a silky smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like a closer shave, I would recommend FEATHER blades.  They are platinum coated as well for a smooth finish to your shave.  However, please please please be careful with FEATHER blades, as they are EXTREMELY SHARP and one wrong move and you&#x27;ll be in the Emergency Room.</li>
    <li> Husband loves these razors</li>
    <li> As a traditional wet shaver, I use double edge safety razors and stay vigilant for a good price on well made blades.  The Astra SP is the best blade currently in production at this price range.  I rate it in the top 3 brands that I use on a weekly basis irregardless of the cost.  Check out The Shave Nook a forum to learn about traditional wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Maybe not the perfect blade for me, but it&#x27;s a good shave and the price was unbeatable. Great all around buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always a pleasure when you get a product the meets expectations. You can&#x27;t beat the price, these blades are great, they give am a nice close shave and the blade lasts for a while. I have a coarse beard and have to shave almost everyday, I&#x27;ll get a good week out of the blade before I decide to change it, but I could probably go longer without a doubt. That means I can go for about a year before I need to order more. Considering I was spending lots of money on the Schlick Quatro cartridges. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision to shave with a safety blade.</li>
    <li> I purchased Astra and Derby blades because when I started looking into shaving with a Safety Razors I found the following comparison. Feather &amp;#62; Bluebird &amp;#62; Astra &amp;#62; Derby. So I started with Feather. As I wrote in my review, they are VERY sharp; TOO sharp. They require just as many passes on my face as the Bluebird, but cut up my skin. So they were out as soon as I finished using them all up. Bluebird was cheap enough, but Astra and Derby are available as Subscribe/Save (WHICH I LOVE! All consumables should be S/S). This made Astra and Derby EVEN CHEAPER than they already are compared to Bluebird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried my first Astra blade last week and this week (I typically use my blades for 3 shaves). I found it to be no worse at giving me a baby-skin-smooth shave than the Bluebird. So, what&#x27;s not to like about the blade? It&#x27;s cheaper than the Bluebird and it shaves just as well. Of course, your results may vary based on your skin and your beard softness. My beard (when it grows out past the scratchy stage) is very soft like my head hair, so perhaps that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m able to get away with a duller blade. Or maybe they&#x27;re just as sharp, but don&#x27;t waste money on the hard plastic blade holders like Feather and Bluebird do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend these enough. Absolutely no nicks or cuts with the blade and it&#x27;s nice and cheap. With the fact that I use these for three days, I&#x27;ve essentially a year&#x27;s worth of blades in this box.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time this item was ordered.  Extremely thin/flexible and sharp! Just what was needed to give my dad a super close, smooth shave. The blades come individually sheathed in something like parchment paper, which can later be used when discarding to avoid cutting oneself. Nice touch in packaging. Definitely would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> If you are unsure about how these are going to work on your face just get them and try them. The variety packs are a huge waste of money and it is better to buy a few 100 packs and try them out. Once you get started with safety razors your friends will jump in and you&#x27;ll have a stash of blades for them to try out. Heck charge them for them or trade them for some beer. I don&#x27;t always shave my face, but when I do I use Astra Superior Premium Platinum Razors.</li>
    <li> These blades are not good for me. I have thick dark hair that grows fast and these just do not seems to be sharp enough. They are a great price but you will pay every time these are tugging on your beard. I also noticed a lot of razor burn with these, I guess they just aren&#x27;t as smooth as Derby&#x27;s. Going back to my Derby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> got them way before time my husband uses these to cat his feet  he wear boots all day and his wet feet get hard skin these are perfect for cutting the dead skin off his feet</li>
    <li> These are better than other blades that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> As advertised and on time.</li>
    <li> These blades, after much sampling of various brands, turns out to be the one that is perfect for my shaving technique, my beard, my face. And the quantity makes the expense very very low.</li>
    <li> The only blade I&#x27;ve bought so far, but seems to work just fine for me.  Might be my technique, or my beard... but I&#x27;m only getting about 2 to maybe three shaves per single blade.  That&#x27;s counting both sides. Very happy overall.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades.  I am using an Edwin Jagger DE, and Astra works much better than the Derby blades the razor came with.  The Astras seem more forgiving and less likely to nick.  I have not tried any brands besides Debry and Astra, but based on the reviews and my own experience, I will stick with Astra.</li>
    <li> So far, with experimenting among some 8 brands now, these are my favorite blades. Overall best combination of sharpness, smoothness, consistency blade to blade, and durability I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I just used my first of these blades about 5 minutes ago.  I am absolutely amazed at how perfect this shave went.  I cannot even hear or feel stubble right now when I rub my hand \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; on my cheeks, it&#x27;s that good!  I got them from the 26-blade sampler and have not yet bought this 100 pack, but definitely will be.  I have used cheap ones (such as the 7am blades) which aren&#x27;t terrible, but they are a bit rough on my face.  Also have used Feather blades, and I did enjoy those a lot, but they didn&#x27;t seem to hit my face \\&quot;just right\\&quot; (and yes, they are VERY sharp just like everyone else has said elsewhere).  While I give these a 5-star rating myself, you should absolutely go ahead and buy a sampler first.  These are perfect for my face, and may for yours as well, but you need to check out a sampler some time to see which is best.  For me, I&#x27;m done looking.</li>
    <li> These &amp; Gillette Super Blues are now the only blades I will buy.  I enjoy their level of sharpness in a Merkur Slant, where the razor&#x27;s amount of exposed aggressiveness and the edge of this blade all come together as the perfect package.  For their quality at this price, you cannot beat them.  Personna&#x27;s are crap &amp; more expensive, I think it just makes some shavers feel good to buy USA made or something.  Have to give it to the Russians on DE blades though, have yet to beat the Gillette Super Blue.</li>
    <li> This type of blade the astra brand is good they are pretty sharp maybe too sharp for sensitive skins so watch out still give it 4 stars it does what its intended and gives a good shave, remember shave with the hairs.</li>
    <li> Nice blades I get a very comfortable 5 or more shaves, I am very happy I made the switch to a double edge razor.</li>
    <li> Several months back I purchased the razor multi-pack from another seller with many different razor brands and types for my double edge razor.  I determined that Platinum blades were best for my skin.  When narrowing down the blades Astra was an excellent blade and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  I put 100 blades for $12 and this will last me at least a full year of shaving.  Can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I go between these and Feathers (which I also recommend).  I find that Astras are very sharp (but not so much as the Feathers), and fairly durable.  They give me an incredibly smooth shave for very cheap.</li>
    <li> Saving millions of dollars using these fine, premium blades. Astra single edge put&#x27;s the BOOTS to the Gillette blade rip off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for over a year now, and when I started I purchased a sampler pack.  I know everyone has different needs and preferences, but I found these to be excellent for sensitive skin.  They work great in my old Gillette Adjustable razors, but these really started to shine with my new Edwin Jagger D89LBL.  What a combo.  2 pass shave, smooth as can be!  And for under $15.00, I use them for 2 shaves and move on.  So, let&#x27;s see, $14.00/100&#x3D; 14 cents a piece/2 &#x3D; 7 cents a shave.  Ummm, sorry multiblade junk, I&#x27;ll be buying these from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 2013 update:  Just went through first box, added second.  I feel like Charlie opening the Willie Wonka candy bar each time a get a new razor ready.  I only use them 2x&#x27;s, still a great value!!!</li>
    <li> These are sharp and are good for many many uses. Great value. Strongly recommend these over the expensive disposable head razors.</li>
    <li> Bought a sampler pack and thought these blades gave me the closest and most comfortable/smoothest shave. They are sharp, but not to sharp like the feather blades. I just purchased 100 blades and hope to enjoy them for the next year or so. I am currently using a Merkur 180 (aka 23c) and Trumpers almond shave cream.</li>
    <li> Great razors!  Very sharp and cut through my hair with no effort.</li>
    <li> When I first started using a safety razor, I immediately gravitated to Merkurs and Feathers and pretty much used them exclusively for a few years - I figured the higher cost must mean they were better products. I tried Astras three years after I started wet shaving, and man these are good - not as sharp as Feathers, but incredibly smooth. Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, this is not a substandard product. As always, blades are a Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV) thing, but the ratings here and at the Badger and Blade website don&#x27;t lie. Try these, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Quick delivery, will buy again from this vendor without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Best purchase EVER! I wished I would&#x27;ve changed to safety blade shaving LONG time ago. Best shave, doesn&#x27;t tear my face every morning, no more ingrown hairs &amp; the cost of blades is SO much cheaper than the conventional blades.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Astra blades by Michael Ham, author of [[ASIN:1448632560 Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving, Third Edition: Shaving Made Enjoyable]] They are some of the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used. I get a nice, close shave and a blade will last for 6 to 7 shaves. I had stopped using a double edge razor about 20 years ago but held on to my old Gillette \\&quot;just in case.\\&quot; I&#x27;m glad I did. These blades are a joy to use. They don&#x27;t tug. They don&#x27;t pull. They just glide across my face. I use them in my Gillette safety razor, the one I purchased new in 1974, and I lather up with [[ASIN:B000MXGMHU Col. Conk World&#x27;s Famous Shaving Soap, Bay Rum (Net Weight 2.25 Oz)]] A good shave is a nice way to start the day.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of derby, wilkinson, and astra. Then, I ordered a hundred of Astra Superior Premium Platinum. At 10 bucks i.e. 10 cents each, Shhhhhhh. Super sharp for 4 shaves. 10 bucks a year. Put it on an Edwin Jagger 39BL and enjoy.</li>
    <li> Best brand I have found. One blade last me around two weeks.</li>
    <li> I tried Feathers, Merkurs, gilette, and some others. These gave me the best, smoothest shave. I also have a year supply.</li>
    <li> i use nothing else. at the price i got this for and as slow as my beard grows, it&#x27;s pretty much a lifetime supply. haha</li>
    <li> My go to blade. Works well at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> They gave me a close shave, but at the price of a bloody neck and massive razor burn.During my first pass with my 34G i already knew something was wrong when i felt a lot of drag, something that has never happened to me with no other blades, no matter how terrible they are, I know that that could have been a defective blade or something, but I am not going to risk getting my face torn up again, at least I only bought a 5 pack.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were incredibly cheap. While each person has a different experience with DE razors, mine was awful with these. They cut my face up, gave me ingrown hairs, and left me irritated for days afterwards. I&#x27;m a great DE shaver, but these blades just were terrible for me. Even thought YMMV, I&#x27;d be inclined to tell you not to get them.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades. For my skin they can&#x27;t be beat, gives me a great shave. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why these blades are getting such high reviews. I opened my 100 pack earlier this week and I shaved with them for the first time. The blade is so dull, it felt like I was dragging a butter knife across my face. And, of course, with such a dull blade, I managed to open several ragged lacerations all over my face. As I write this, I am bleeding profusely from two of those cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so highly rated - this is nowhere near as good as my last blade choice. My reliance on the wisdom of the Amazon reviewer masses seem misplaced now in retrospect and I am left with a bloodied face and 99 razors I no longer want.</li>
    <li> Sharp, cheap, and effective!</li>
    <li> Sharp and cheap. Nuff said. These blades will save me tons of $$$ and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades.  These are some of the least expensive and by far the sharpest and most comfortable.</li>
    <li> Savings alone would make these worth it, but at the cost per blade for these, I often forget I should really change these blades every 3-4 shaves, and still get close, smooth, nick free shaves for up to 2 weeks a blade with these, and I have a coarse beard that grows shows by 5pm every day.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that a blade that works great for me, may or may not work for you and a blade that works great for you may or may not work for me.  There are so many variables that one cannot possibly predict which blades will work for them.  That is exactly why you want to try different blades to find which ones work well for you.  This is exactly why you will see 5 star reviews along with 1 star reviews for the same blade.  Take a look at how many good reviews vs. bad reviews a particular blade gets.  If a blade is getting more good than bad reviews then you stand a better chance of that blade working for you, if it gets more bad reviews than good then perhaps you stand less of a chance it will work for you.  But this is just an example of the law of averages.  The bottom line is you have to try different blades to see which ones work well for you.  Period!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a collection of about a dozen different de razors and a blade that works well in one razor may not work so well in another razor since each razor presents the blade just a bit differently than another razor.  Just another of the variables you will encounter in wetshaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started wetshaving with a double edge razor I started with an Edwin Jagger DE89 razor and Merkur blades and used that one razor and one type of blade for about 6 weeks whilst developing my technique with this type of razor.  Only then did I start trying different brands of blades.  Some were worse, some were better.  When I tried an Astra SP I was amazed at how smooth of a shave I was getting from these blades.  I have tried Astra SP&#x27;s in several different razors with varying results but always good results.  One of my favorite combinations of razor and blade is a Gillette 40&#x27;s style SuperSpeed razor with an Astra SP blade.  In this combo I don&#x27;t even feel the blade, it&#x27;s that smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other razors and blades I like very much like my Feather AS-D1 with a Personna Medical Prep blade, very, very nice.  But the Personna Med Prep blades are $.32 each and I pay only $.08 for an Astra SP blade.  So you can imagine I really like these blades, not only silky smooth, but economical as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a source of the Astra SP&#x27;s for $8.00 for 100 blades so I bought 1500 blades.  I get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of an Astra SP blade so I have enough blades to last me 30 years.  These 1500 blades cost about the same as 1 year&#x27;s worth of the multi-blade cartridges so I&#x27;m way ahead of the game.  My shaving  supplies cost me next to nothing and I&#x27;m getting better shaves than I ever got in the past 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now please allow me to correct a couple of misconceptions I&#x27;ve seen in reading the many reviews of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) \\&quot;These blades are not made by Gillette.\\&quot;  That is incorrect.  These blades are made in the Procter &amp; Gamble factory in St Petersburg, Russia, by Gillette.  This factory has produced and continues to produce some of the finest de blades ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I see a few complaints about glue spots on the blade.  It is not glue!  It is actually wax and it has absolutely no effect on the blades performance.  If I&#x27;m using a one piece TTO razor I put the blade in the razor with the wax spots up.  If I&#x27;m using a 2 or 3 piece razor I put the blade in the razor with the wax spots down.  Other than that, I don&#x27;t even give the wax spots a second thought.  I usually loosen my razor at the end of a shave and rinse the razor in very hot tap water, by the time I change the blade the wax is all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself extremely lucky to have found a blade that is silky smooth and only costs me $.08 each.  But again, the only way to find out if these blades will work well for you is to try them.  I would suggest buying a couple of packs to try before you make a bulk purchase.  You may get lucky and find them as smooth as I have.  Astra SP&#x27;s are my go-to-blade.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Work great smooth fast shave for a good price</li>
    <li> I recently stopped using razor cartridges so I could save money for retirement. :)  Seriously, buying these blades in bulk is great considering that now I&#x27;m only paying 10 cents per shave, I use a brand new blade every time, and I never have to think about how many times I&#x27;ve used the same blade.  These blades give a close shave and I have not had any problems with those pesky in-grown stubbles on the neck.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to using cartridges ever again.  Great buy... strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> cheap and disposable. I use a new one everytime I shave.</li>
    <li> I tried many different DE razor brands via sample packs.  I ranked these just below Feathers in terms of sharpness but my face appreciated these a little more.  And at this price it&#x27;s sort of a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Some are too sharp, some are too dull, some wear out fast and some are just perfect. These Astra Blades are the best DE blades I have used to date.</li>
    <li> My experience so far (3 shaves)has been very good.  They&#x27;re not as sharp as my current favorites, the Feathers, but they don&#x27;t have as much \\&quot;bite\\&quot; as the Feathers do, either.  The Astra Platinum blades seem to slide over the skin a little easier, while still being very sharp.  Overall, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re a worthy competitor to the Feather blades.  Especially so since they&#x27;re so much less expensive.    My only concern is how well they hold up.  Three shaves on my first and still going strong.    update: up to seven shaves, and only a couple nicks on the seventh shave.  The Astras held up nearly as well as Feathers, on my beard at least.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good these blades are! I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for about 8 months with an Edwin Jagger and Dorcos St301&#x27;s, and I thought I was getting a great shave.... Then I tried these Astra Blades! AMAZING!  With these razors this is the smoothest my neck has ever been. The Astra blades just glide across my face, with zero hiccups.    I highly recommend the Astra blades!</li>
    <li> Amazing amount of blades for the price</li>
    <li> Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The price is good but the blades have glue on them. It is really annoying. I get a good shave and the price is good. The problem with the glue is that a bit gets on the blade but that can be removed. Just bear that in mind.</li>
    <li> I have stated DE shaving about 2 months ago and have tried a variety of blades, Feather, Persona Lab, Persona Med, Gillette Silver Blue, Voskhod,  Treat Silver and Rapira Stainless.  Out of all of them the Astra gives me the closest, less irritating and most consistent shave. Don&#x27;t get me wrong some of the others, Feather, Persona Med, Gillette Silver Blue and Voskhod were good however on a day to day basis the Astra was the best for me.  I would say my beard is tough but I have sensitive skin and the others either did not last very long or caused irritation after 2 or 3 shaves. The Astra blades last about 4 or 5 comfortable shaves.  2 passes using Shave Secret shave oil, splash on some cold water, a little Afta lotion and I am good to go. I was able to find these for $10 for 100 blades and free shipping, what a deal  So find the blade that works for you through trial and error, however if you have a tough beard with sensitive skin give these a try.</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth shave for me, but as is everything for DE shaving, your results may vary.</li>
    <li> best blades from the 4 I&#x27;ve bought</li>
    <li> no complaints. Bought a box years ago. haven&#x27;t had to buy razors since.</li>
    <li> Great quality razors. You can get at least 4+ shaves out of each blade. These blades give you a very close and smooth shave and are much less expensive than buying the 4-5 blade razors at your local grocery store.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re in my list of top five blades, not too dull and not too sharp.</li>
    <li> excellent buy and good quality.</li>
    <li> My preferred blades.  The right edge for my face.</li>
    <li> Definitely a sharp razor, giving them 5 stars because of the price and quality. They did not work great for me, I tend to get cuts with these but I also get cuts with Feather, Derby and Gillette Platinum blades as well. But the Gillette Super Stainless work awesome for my face so if you are new to DE razor shaving I would definitely suggest a sampler pack and find the blade that works best for your skin type. I can&#x27;t fault a good product just because I didn&#x27;t have stellar results, razors be a tricky beast.</li>
    <li> i prefer Astra&#x27;s &amp;#34;superior stainless&amp;#34; blades, maybe even Rapira&#x27;s &amp;#34;super stainless&amp;#34;, but this is a good blade at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great shave. Haven&#x27;t bought razors in a year thanks to this 100 pack</li>
    <li> I recently started using a double edge safety razor because I always wanted to shave with one. These were such a fantastic deal from Amazon that I got one for my twin brother as well. These are a steal at the price for 100 blades! The price of Mach III and Schick refills were hurting my bank account severely. I love these and get a better shave when using a double edge safety razor. Great deal!</li>
    <li> I bought these a year ago and I still haven&#x27;t run out. High quality blades. And this literally costs less than some 12 pack razor cartridges on newer razors. There are 20 packs of 5. That&#x27;s 100 blades!</li>
    <li> Good quality blades. No receptacle for disposal provided. This will not stop me from re-ordering</li>
    <li> Great quality.. great price. These kinds of products either work or they don&#x27;t. Every blade I&#x27;ve used has been consistently sharp and lasted about a week.</li>
    <li> These blades are consistently sharp and work excellent in all my DE razors.  A great buy for the price !!</li>
    <li> Nice safety razor blades at a nice price.  These are packed in a dispenser box, that dispenses 5 unit boxes (5 individually wrapped blades, in a small box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seems to have a mild cut, and I tend to get 2 to 4 days on each blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one who usually writes reviews, but gawdamnnnn these little pieces of steel are something to talk about! Guaranteed to be the best shave you can get from these types of blades. If you want a smooth, clean, no tugging shave that leaves you feeling great, then get these! If you like a crappy, not so close shave then these are not for you! I mean why take my word for it? You don&#x27;t even know me... Right? Spend a few bucks, try them, join the club, and then you&#x27;ll see why I wrote a review!</li>
    <li> These are good blades.  I shave 3 times a week.  By the sixth shave the blade is dull and needs replacement.    One annoying thing they have done with these blades is put two drops of glue on the blade I guess to keep the wrapping secure.  However, sometimes the glue is over the edge (blade) and then you have to clean it because it will interfere with shaving.    Other than that they work fine.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My man seems to like them.</li>
    <li> These are probably fine if you don&#x27;t have course hair, but I do and I noticed a big difference from these and the Feather brand razors that I tried previously. The Feathers claim to be manufactured via a unique patented pprocess and I now believe it. I will definitely have to switch back to the Feather razors, but like I said. if you have finer hair, you may not notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Good blades for me.  I change mine once a week or every 6 days if I feel like it.</li>
    <li> I just started DE shaving, and initially started doing it as a way to save money, but I&#x27;m really starting to believe that they work much better than the extremely expensive cartridges. I started with a sample pack and the Astra were the only ones that didn&#x27;t leave me with wicked razor bumps under my neck and chin. They were the best ones out of the bunch, and I really enjoyed the ritualistic feeling of wet shaving, as opposed to dry shaving which I had been doing since I was a teenager. Anyway, the value of the Astra razors is really good and I like using them, but I&#x27;m also reviewing because I found the absolute best hack for using them.  My buddy is a barber and he taught me that using just a little bit of tea tree oil on your razor makes them a) last longer b) prevent razor bumps and c) work as a bit of a moisturizer if you get the right brand. I stole this brand [[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]] from my sister, but eventually wore down and bought my own because I like it so much. The tea tree oil works as an antibacterial product, preventing the mini-infections known as ingrown hairs. It also worked well with keeping my face smooth after I had finished shaving. Since the oil worked I also bought the [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]] to use as a face scrub, and this essentially got rid of all my skin problems. As for the razor, I&#x27;m not sure why it works better with it, but after a whole week of using it on my razor after I was done, they&#x27;re a lot less dull than they would normally be. I give these razors five stars and I definitely recommend using the tea tree oil trick. It works so well!</li>
    <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve ever used for my razor at the best price I&#x27;ve seen</li>
    <li> Best and sharpest blades on the market Oman experienced barber for 13,years w over 100 clients weekly mans these by far are the best</li>
    <li> Good for the price, I&#x27;m happy to have switched back to the safety razor.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving. I&#x27;ve spent the past few years through college just using my beard trimmer to get the 5 o clock shadow look because I got ingrown hairs and razor burn no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried $200 electric braun razors, top of the line 5 blade razors, specialty shaving creams and gels, and sensitive skin razors. No matter what avenue I took, I would end up with extremely sensitive skin due to razor burn on my neck, and ingrown hairs all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had contemplated switching to DE for years, but was hesitant due to the &amp;#34;learning curve.&amp;#34; However, I have to say this is by far the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made. I have only cute myself once, and that was due to a sampler pack of blades I initially purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave about 20 blades a shot, and the Astra platinum blades were the best for my face. Feathers were undoubtedly the sharpest of the pack, but too sharp for my skin (hence how I got my first and only DE cut). After sampling so many blades, I knew this was the blade for me. 1 blades lasts a good 3 shaves, more if you have softer whiskers, but since they&#x27;re so cheap, I switch mine out every 2 shaves just to get the best quality shave I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a VDH handle from target for $18,  and a highly rated shave soap (prorasaro?), a badger brush, and haven&#x27;t looked back since. In just two weeks of shaving consistently every other day with these blades, my face and neck have completely cleared up. My girlfriend noticed and asked what I was doing differently and said my face has never been so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do a triple pass shave every other day, lathering up in between each pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, without a doubt this is the blade for me, but I would still suggest trying a sample pack first. At any rate, even though my trimmer was definitely the cheapest shaving route, I could never label that as a shave. I can now enjoy have a smooth, blemish-free face all the time, and enjoy the shaving experience every time. It&#x27;s actually something I look forward to every night. I shave at night, after showering, usually around 10-11pm. My face doesn&#x27;t start feeling like sandpaper until about 3-4pm the next day, and doesn&#x27;t start looking unkempt until the second day - this coming from a guy who has had a full goatee since 7th grade and a full beard since 9th grade. The shave is incredibly close, without causing irritation. All of these positive reviews aren&#x27;t just blowing smoke. These blades are the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble is that I wish each 5ct box came with a blade dispenser like some other brands do. But I just toss them in a small cardboard box until they&#x27;re ready to go out.</li>
    <li> Great sharp razors at a low price!</li>
    <li> I bought 100.  I used 100.  I was happy to move to a better, slightly more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> Great blade at a great price. Shaves very close without irritating the skin. Smooth as silk with no razor rash. While everyone does not have the same hair or skin, this blade is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Great edge. Does not seem to last as long as a merkur blade.  But priced well enough that you can change them often.</li>
    <li> Fantastic razors - they fit my Maggard handle perfectly</li>
    <li> If you have coarse facial hair, stay away, this will eat your face.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving (about 2.5 months now) and these are the second brand of blade that I have used.  I used Feather blades first and found them too harsh and was nicking myself quite a lot.  I say that I have sensitive skin and these, give a nice close shave with minimal nicking.     The only complaint I have is that these 100 blades come in a \\&quot;Flat.\\&quot; That is, 20 cardboard packs of 5 on a foldable display.  I was hoping for the elongated dispenser that is pictured... but that is really trivial.  I have gone through six blades and I have not yet incountered the glue problem mentioned in eariler posts.</li>
    <li> Very good blades.  These are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever used so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but they seem to be one of the least expensive and they give a great shave!</li>
    <li> For a cheap blade, these cut amazingly. Hardly ever nick myself, and they last 4-6 shaves on average.</li>
    <li> Tired of the abusive prices of those modern 4(5?) blades razors, I&#x27;ve decided to go back to tradition and choose Astra among others brands thanks to price( yeah I&#x27;m and old cheap sap!) First impression is that the blade&#x27;s thickness is too thin which make shaving a bit difficult. If I realize, in the future, that is my not being re-adapted to traditional shaving I re-qualify it to  5 stars!</li>
    <li> These are the first blades I have tried.  They offer great shaves on first go, but second use feels dull toward the end of the shave.</li>
    <li> I bought a sampler pack, and decided that these and feather gave me the closest shave.  The Astra was cheaper so I went with these.  I really like them so far.  I can get through about 5 shaves with each blade, with no nicks.</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave I have ever had including barbershop straight shaves. Blade stays sharp and I have very thick and coarse hair most blades hardly last a single shave, this one is insane! Three times the life of a feather or shark blade. Only blade I will ever use. So smooth! Its amazing!</li>
    <li> These are great blades at a great price.  Sharp and sturdy.  Really good buy.  I would recommend these for anyone looking for blades.</li>
    <li> Great blades reviews here are accurate I dove in and bought a hundred pack but orobally should have bought some samples as most people will suggest  Every face is different and the blade will react according so you shave experience may be different</li>
    <li> just shaved with Astra double edge and wow what a shave!! it&#x27;s smooth and still feels sharp enough to go a couple of more rounds other double edge razors i have used I&#x27;d have to replace after first shave, but this is a nay will add to review after next shave!!!!!!! great buy!! nothing better out the made in Russia!! (this is a review on second shave same side same razor, shave like it did the first time no dulling! great buy i irdered another, will have razors till dooms day!! buy buy buy!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good blades but Merkur blades work better for me.</li>
    <li> Having gotten these then you&#x27;ve joined the masses heading towards better / cheaper shaves thanks to people finding that the way Dad and Granddad shaved was actually better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra Superior Platinum Blades are my choice simply because they work for me.  I get an amazingly good shave with these, they last way longer than other blades I&#x27;ve tried and I recommend these to everyone that I know that is a double edged shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all blades are not the same and different blade / razor combinations yield different results for different people.  These work for me.  Give them a try.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I know razors vary for everyone. I myself went through about 5 different blades, all different brands, till I used Astra Premium. So far I am very satisfied. According to my barber, I have rough, coarse facial hair, so I have to switch blades or edge every 5-7 days, but every shave is smooth and I get no irritation. But that&#x27;s me. I hope it works as well or better for anyone else who chooses to use this product.</li>
    <li> very good  blades , i shaved at least 11 times just with one (1) blade . I just want to see for how many shave will last . it&#x27;s amazing !!!</li>
    <li> Since my return to DE shaving a few years ago, I tried several different blades.  Then at my brother&#x27;s suggestion, I tried these Astra SP blades.  These are unquestionably the best performing blades of all those I tried.  Consistent performance, blade after blade, in all my different DE razors. (Though blade performance is often a subjective thing. YMMV.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this Amazon price makes them the most affordable of all the top-brand blades.  $10 for a 2-year supply (1 blade/week) is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to double-edge (DE) shaving, but bought these for the good reviews and the low, low price. The shave so far has been great, with no nasty nicks and a couple minuscule scrapes which are nothing compared to the disposables I used previously. I&#x27;ve have no problems with the wax on the wrapper mucking up the razor and don&#x27;t understand the complaints.</li>
    <li> This product is the best of the variety pack I had purchased. Much better than their standard stainless variety. You will not find a better cost to performance ratio for safety razors. I can&#x27;t recommend these enough!</li>
    <li> Love these blades. They seem to hold their edge longer for me. Nice, smooth blades, and super cheap especially compared to the prices of multi blade cartridges these days.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor  and these razors are awesome. I have very sensitive skin and have never tried to shave with a safety razor before. I spent tons of money on Mach razors and only would get 5 uses out of them. I started with Astra razors after reading reviews and yes I have become a fan. Not only am I saving money, I am also getting  a close shave with cutting myself.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Leaves the skin with nice close smooth shave. Great price as well for a good product like this.</li>
    <li> These are great blades. They are a little less aggressive than feathers and half the price. They work perfectly for my beard.</li>
    <li> I found the razors in a sample package I ordered on here and they worked great. They didn&#x27;t get dull too fast(I shave my head and face) and definitely don&#x27;t get nics or razor burn with these like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried. Great product!</li>
    <li> my husband uses these and he seems to like them. a close shave and less bleeding :0</li>
    <li> Arrived yesterday and gave the blades a try on 4 days of stubble.  I have pretty thick facial hair, but this blade shaved right through it cleanly and with no pulling on my face or whiskers.</li>
    <li> no complaints, great price.</li>
    <li> best blades to shave with</li>
    <li> When I first switched to a DE safety razor, I read in several places that buying a variety pack of blades would be a good way to determine which blade is best for you.  I followed that advice, and found that the Astra was my favorite blade of the bunch.  They give me a nice close shave without being too aggressive and causing irritation.  Based on that experience I bought this box of 100 blades, which is a great value, especially if you compare the price/blade to the cost of disposable cartridge razors.  I&#x27;ve been using them happily for about a year now and still have many, many more blades to go.</li>
    <li> I was given a five pack of Astra blades as a gift.  I love them.  For me, they provide a smooth, comfortable shave at a very reasonable price.  They are very sharp, but do not knick or burn my face.  When this 100 pack is gone, I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these for his razor. He could not believe how many you get for the price. He used to use the brand, I think Mercer, where the price of five was the same as this whole box. He is really happy.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good low cost blade for regular use in my DE razor. I had tried a few others but they were either too aggressive or only lasted for a couple of shaves. These guys are awesome and are very comfortable to shave with. I can get through a full week of shaving on one. Of course, YMMV.</li>
    <li> Just what I need it, nice quality blades smoth clean shave, I recommend this product and seller 100% if u need a nice quality blades for a greate price this is the place for it</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Item was perfect.</li>
    <li> These razor blades are cheap,  work great, and are easy to use! Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Amazing blades for your safety razor. Nice close clean and comfortable shave. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The good shave the blade has at the begining will only last for 3 or 4 shaves.</li>
    <li> The first shave with a new blade was great. After that, however, the blade would dull to the point of pulling my hair our, making for terrible shaves. Will switch to new brand.</li>
    <li> I think this is an excellent blade. So why the four stars? Trying to unwrap each blade requires either patience or long nails. So far, each blade I have used has stuck to the waxed paper and you can easily cut your self while unwrapping.</li>
    <li> Great blade for a normal face. If you have a sensitive face you may need a different blade such as a Merkur or if your beard is tough a Feather. But this is a great everyday blade for the average beard.</li>
    <li> These are a great standard blade for those transitioning to DE shaving;  due to their outstanding predictable performance at the lowest price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to Personna Lab Blues for only two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) the current USA/Russia political situation&lt;br /&gt;2) inconsistent quality control.  My box of blades had a ridiculous amount of wax on the blade (printed paper), which uglified the razor;  my girlfriend&#x27;s box was wrapped differently and did not (white paper).</li>
    <li> great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> astra blade are my blade of choice but buying a blade because someone else loves it is like saying your favorite color is green because mine is. never regretted the purchase. love astra blades seem to stay sharper longer than my derbys on my skin.</li>
    <li> You have enough to last a lifetime of shaving so many</li>
    <li> Quality and value without compromise. These are the best, and least expensive double edged razor blades I&#x27;ve ever used, and with a price like that I can afford to use a new blade much more often, allowing me to feel more comfortable as I shave.</li>
    <li> Love these blades. Super sharp. I get about 4 shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a DE razor for almost a year now and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I went through the combo packs with different brands and when it came time to order some new blades, I read the reviews on the Astra, and figured I&#x27;d give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;Boy, I wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t perform well, in my opinion, and seem less sharp and less durable than even the lower priced Derby Blades.&lt;br /&gt;I use them on my legs in the bath, and I have never had to change blades midway through, but with these, I did one leg and figured I&#x27;d better change the blade before I attempted the next, unless I wanted major razor burn and small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;These blades don&#x27;t glide. No matter what type of shaving soap or creme I use - and believe me, I don&#x27;t use the cheap stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed. These blades just aren&#x27;t up to snuff - at least the batch I received.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer</li>
    <li> Combined with my $2.84 double edge razor, I am estimating 4 to 5 years worth of low / no cost shaves.  Feed up with getting ripped off by razor companies, starting using them about 4 months ago and have no regrets.  In fact, I laugh out loud every time I pass that isle in the store.</li>
    <li> Great blades.  Feels much better to shave a weekend beard on Monday than with any other blade before.</li>
    <li> I usually use Derby or Feather blades, and the Astra proved to be a happy medium. A tad sharper than Derby, but lacking the nice blade disposal in the dispensers.</li>
    <li> I was using Feather but I I actually prefer these blades.  Very smooth, close shave.  Works perfectly with my Merkur Heavy Classic.</li>
    <li> I like them and have tried feather before.  I think next time I&#x27;m going to try a &#x27;made in the usa&#x27; brand.</li>
    <li> The best way to make a $75 safety razor shaver into a $5 safety razor shaver, is by using sub-par blades.  Astra Superior Premium Platinum are indeed premium, and - after extensive testing - the only brand I use anymore.  Several other brands give a similarly close and smooth shave (Derby Extra and Feather), but the Astra blades often lasted two or three shaves longer than the others.  I recommend trying several brands out, because everyone has a different face and different needs.  However, for my personal usage, it&#x27;s Astra Superior Premium Platinum blades or nothing.</li>
    <li> My husband was having a hard time finding double edge razor blades at any of the local stores.  Of course I was able to find them at Amazon for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great double edge blades for his Eversharp double edge safety razor.  This package of 100 blades will probably last him the rest of his life (since he just trims around his beard) but was almost the same price as a much smaller package so what the heck.</li>
    <li> As per advertisement.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good blades. You get a large amount and they are very sharp. Great product.</li>
    <li> There are far better \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; blades out there. It you are an everyday shaver, the blade doesn&#x27;t even last a week. Other brands you can go multiple weeks before changing.</li>
    <li> good blades at the best price , what can I say they get the job done don&#x27;t cost much at all .</li>
    <li> Blades work differently in different razors for different people. Do what everyone else does, get a sampler pack from somewhere cheap. Try a bunch of different blades until you find one that works great for you. These are among my favorite blades to use in my progress razor. Your experience may differ.</li>
    <li> A year later and still have lots of these left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable and great quality</li>
    <li> I first bought one of those variety blade packs to find a blade that would give a great shave and not leave me looking like a victim of Jack the Ripper.  Anyway these were in that pack and for my beard and skin were far and away the best blade, the 100 pack is a real value too.  So happy to shave every morning now, just love em.</li>
    <li> Five stars for this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many many reviews, I decided to try these.  They were great, they are SUPER sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are pics on BB of these as well as a few other under a neutron microscope.  These blades are better than feather blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another that was far better than the feathers were derby blades.</li>
    <li> I bought these as my first set of blades with a new Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor, so haven&#x27;t compared them with other safety razor blades. They were highly rated and quite reasonably priced. I&#x27;m fully happy with them. I shave twice (with and against the grain) each morning and don&#x27;t notice any degradation in performance after four days.</li>
    <li> These are my go to DE blades.  There are lots of great options, but this combination of a smooth, comfortable shave, life of blade and cost is really tough to beat.  An excellent choice.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades. I&#x27;ve got a tough, thick beard, and these work great!</li>
    <li> I had been using Derbys for the last 2 years and have found these to a better quality and a great price.</li>
    <li> Tried 4 or 5 different &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; brands like &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; etc.... these seem to be the sharpest of em all and hold their edge better than any other I&#x27;ve seen yet.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT quality razor blades. For the price, they&#x27;re a steal! I&#x27;ve gone through 30 in a year and this package can easily last me 3 years!</li>
    <li> good product. Works well.</li>
    <li> Excellent high quality blades.</li>
    <li> Awesome! So much cheaper than using cartridge razors. You can change the blade each time you shave, and still not run out of these things for months. Stays sharp and works great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These blades are great! I shave 3-4 times a week and find I change the blade weekly.</li>
    <li> What can you say? these are good blades</li>
    <li> Cheap, Russian and by the hundreds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are Platinum Double Edge Safety Blades made in Russia. I&#x27;d like to think they are made in a Siberian gulag by a man who has been wrongly accused of murdering his wife and is slowly gathering the metal shavings to form into some sort of cool escape tool. In the meantime though, his single purpose in life is to make me quality razor blades which I buy at an extremely low price by the hundred. Thanks buddy and GOOD LUCK!</li>
    <li> I made the switch to DE razors in July of 2013.&lt;br /&gt;I picked up the Parker 99R as my first razor which came with 5 shark super chrome blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shark blades were ok.&lt;br /&gt;I got a few nicks but that&#x27;s to be expected when youre relearning how to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a different blade to compare the sharks too, and I considered a variety pack,&lt;br /&gt;but then I found this box of 100 blades for $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read reviews of astra blades and they usually ranked just below Feather for sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for six months and theyre great.&lt;br /&gt;Close clean shaves each time.&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium beard and usually use a three pass shave every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Ive used them on 4 and five day growth bears as well with no issues,&lt;br /&gt;still got a good shave after three passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each blade easily lasts a week.&lt;br /&gt;The box contains 20 smaller boxes that have 5 blades each.&lt;br /&gt;Each blade in the smaller boxes is wrapped in paper.&lt;br /&gt;This make is easy to throw a 5 pack of blades into your shaving kit for a road trip.&lt;br /&gt;**you may not want to take them on a plane**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So doing some quick math.&lt;br /&gt;100 blades costs $10.34, that means each week of shaving costs 10.34 cents in blades.&lt;br /&gt;52 weeks in a year means $10 will have you set for blades for just under two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has several different variety packs if you want to try different blades,&lt;br /&gt;however I&#x27;m fine sticking with astra for a couple years.</li>
    <li> I have switched to safety razors over a year ago. Since then, I tried several brands of blades and found these to be the best because they are perfectly sharp, and yet do not bite your skin (which I found to be problematic with some other brands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t let the modern razor-makers sell you on the whole multiple-blade hogwash. You don&#x27;t need five blades on the razor for a clean shave; all you need is a sharp blade. And because these are so inexpensive, I have been changing blades every single day and have been enjoying a perfect shave every time. (Note: You don&#x27;t have to change these blades every day. First, they remain perfectly sharp after a few shaves. I change them daily because it is my preference. And two, they have two sides, so you can alternate them.)</li>
    <li> These blades are great. You get a crap ton of blades at what it would cost to buy 3 cartridge types. I would recommend buying an assortment pack first to test and see which ones you like best.</li>
    <li> Great value for the number of blades. I&#x27;m a woman, and I switched to DE shaving because regular disposables are just so wasteful. With these, I can save up the blades in an Altoids tin, and then just recycle the whole thing. Because I use these mostly on my legs I don&#x27;t really have an in-depth review of the performance of these blades vs others, but they get the job done for me so I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I am use to gillette and generic store brands. These are so much better. Not nicks or tugs. One blade lasts about 2 weeks. These will last about 2 to 4 years.</li>
    <li> Blades cut well, same as the Gelletts I have. But this product has a lot of sticky glue on all 4 corners after unwrapping. I always have to spent 30-40 seconds carefully wiping it off before I put it in my DE</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Astra Stainless Steel blades, but the Astra Platinum blades I got in my sampler pack were awful. They&#x27;re dull and they dumped so much wax on the back of the blade that it actually covers the cutting edge, making them virtually unusable. It feels like shaving with a piece of broken glass. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or if they just have bad quality control for their blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like I said, I love their stainless steel blades so I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> For the money, these can&#x27;t be beat.  A dime apiece and I change at least once a week.  Always sharp and comfortable.</li>
    <li> My favorite razor is a 40&#x27;s Gillette Super Speed. These Astra blades are wonderful in this razor. I always get an excellent shave with no tugging or nicks. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I must say I was a little skeptical although all the reviews for this product were nothing short of fantastic. I recently purchased a Merkur safety razor and although I have been very pleased with the Merkur premium razors that came with my purchase (and from what I understand are considered great blades)they still gave me some irritation and snagging while shaving. I was considering just ordering the Feathers but decided to give these a try first. Exceptional! The Astra blades come out to about 10 cents a blade and I must say my shave is probably twice as smooth and enjoyable. What a pleasant surprise. I don&#x27;t think, at least for my face, it could get much better. I hope they last at least two or three shaves but I have yet to test them on longevity. But for so cheap it doesn&#x27;t really matter. I see what some have mentioned as the \\&quot;glue problem,\\&quot; and I ran into this on this first blade I opened and yes, it is a little annoying but it really didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference to me really. Just be careful in trying to wipe the glue off as the blades are inherently sharp and its pretty easy to cut yourself (duh). Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These are made in the same factory as the Gillette blades, but much cheaper in cost.  I find them adequate or sometimes equal to Gillette blades, but much much cheaper.</li>
    <li> If you are currently shaving with the 5 blade cartage razors, do yourself a favor and get into wet shaving you can&#x27;t go wrong! I bought this blades for 10.99, can&#x27;t ask for nothing better. I have used Feather and Derby blades, and I have to say these are great! They are not better than Feather blades, but they are better than Derby blades in my opinion. So can&#x27;t go wrong, oh and great seller.</li>
    <li> I am a black American male with typical black male facial skin.  I have been shaving for over twenty years and have used many different types of shaving devices.  I have been using  double edge razor blades for only two months but the effect and results these razor blades have had on my facial skin is simply Awesome.  My facial skin used to brake out with typical razor bumps from shaving and ingrown hairs but since I ve started using these razors my skin has totally cleared up.  Before I was shaving with the very expensive Mark 3 and 4 razors but these razor blades are awesome and cheaper in the long run.. Great product I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just look at the title of the product: \\&quot;100 Astra Super Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades.\\&quot;  Look at the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone knows that platinum&#x27;s market value is on par with gold.  But as consumers, we&#x27;re accustomed to the word \\&quot;platinum\\&quot; being used to describe a degree of quality... as in \\&quot;he&#x27;s a platinum member-- so if he wants a bathrobe made from panda, we&#x27;ll hunt one down, stitch up a bathrobe out of it, and have it on his bed in less than two hours, with a bow around it, and an Andes mint in gold foil laying on top.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So one can infer that platinum, as a metal, is better than steel.  When I look at this product title and picture, I see \\&quot;platinum blades\\&quot;.  In fact, I can&#x27;t even find the word \\&quot;steel\\&quot; anywhere on the product pictures.  You have to dig into the actual description to find that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down for deceptive advertising.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a double edged (DE) razor for about 5 years.  Like many people I switched to a DE razor due to the high costs of \\&quot;modern, technologically advanced\\&quot; replacable blades.  It is my opinion that you get a better shave with DE razors or straight razors anyway.  I just wish I could convince everyone of that, but it is hard to compete with those commercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Merkur Super Platinum blades exclusively and have been very happy with their performance.  What I wasn&#x27;t happy with was their cost, but with most things I figured you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day when I opened my last pack of Merkur blades I made a mental note to buy more.  Of course, I came to Amazon first.  Just before I clicked the \\&quot;place your order\\&quot; button for the Merkur blades I decided to look at some of the reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I did because the reviews convinced me to order the MUCH cheaper Astra blades and give them a try.  I was/am impressed with their performance.  The Astra blades shave just as close as the more expensive Murker blades and actually caused less nicks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t like about the Astra blades is the 4 little dots of glue that hold on the wax paper, but it seems to come off quickly in warm water, so I&#x27;m not faulting these blades for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased with these Astra blades that I decided to try other brands so I ordered a box of Derby blades too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I will more than likely be ordering more of these blades in the future, especially at this price.  The Derby blades are cheaper so if they do as well as the Astra and Merkur blades, I&#x27;ll probably order them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, you should know that I have a very thick, course beard that grows quickly.  I have used the first Astra blade twice and it seems that it has a couple more shaves left in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is how well these blades will keep in storage.  The wax paper doesn&#x27;t seem to have the oilin it that the Merkur blades do to prevent rust.  (I&#x27;m thinking long term storage in case TSHTF)</li>
    <li> I find this blade to be a good middle ground, and use it daily.  The price is reasonable and the blade not to sharp, it feels smooth compared to some of the others I have used.  I use it for a bout 5 shaves and then they go to the recycling bin.</li>
    <li> these blades are great, i tried the shark blades and i would get nicks, cuts, and irritation... but not with these, if you&#x27;re a beginner to the double edge razor, these blades are nice.</li>
    <li> I gave it a try twice (just in case one of the blades was defective. It worked OK but felt a bit scratchy and did not have the fluid motion feel of new blades that another brand I&#x27;m using now provides.</li>
    <li> When I dumped my electric razor about a year ago, I bought a sample pack of DE blades featuring all the well-known brands. After experimenting with them all I kept coming back to Astra platinum. They leave my face baby-smooth and don&#x27;t cause the red, irritated bumps that some of the other blades left behind. Astra has since been my one and only brand. Now, that being said, just because these blades are perfect for my face does not mean they will be perfect for yours. Your face may be better suited to Derby, Merkur, Feather, etc. My recommendation if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving: start with a sample pack and find the blade that works best for you.</li>
    <li> I had been safety razor shaving for about two years before deciding to upgrade from the dollar store brand.  I purchased these blades about 2 months ago and am still on the first blade.  At this rate this 100 blade box could last a decade.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this higher is that the blades are much sharper than normal blades and require even more technique to shave without cutting yourself.  I also noticed the blade had a bit of a break in period of about 2 shaves before the shave became truly comfortable.  I&#x27;ve noticed this with most every blade I&#x27;ve used though.  Usually for me the first shave is a bit rough, the next shave is better, and from then on the blade feels smooth against the skin.  I recommend getting yourself a boar&#x27;s hair brush and some proper shaving soap and bowl to get a good lather.  Superior blades need the superior lubrication of a good lather that the canned stuff just can&#x27;t match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether I&#x27;d say these blades are a great value.  You won&#x27;t be running out any time soon, and you&#x27;ll be getting superb shaves for a very long time.  If you use a Double Edged safety razor, then Astra could be a good upgrade from the cheaper blades.  If you&#x27;re using cartridge razors, then I highly recommend you pick up a safety razor then a pack of Astra blades and learn how to shave like a man.</li>
    <li> pair with the merkur future and a decent oil and shave soap/brush for a killer shave. all the reviews I thought were a little hyped up but once I received the product, these blades by far are the best blades for the price point.</li>
    <li> best blades i have used yet. no tugging or pulling when I don&#x27;t shave for a couple of days. just a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This is my preferred brand of razor for my safety razor, and this will last me a year at least! Great pricing!</li>
    <li> Sharp blade, can get two good shaves.</li>
    <li> 100 blades for around $10, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Absolute waste of money on these blades.  Can not even get one decent shave with one of these blades.  Spend your money on another brand.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to blade.  It is a more forgiving than Feather and sometimes you just want to shave without worry.  So, I buy 100&#x27;s of each and choose which to use depending on the razor selected, the soap used and how much I feel like concentrating.  I can get away with a lot more sloppiness when using the Astra&#x27;s.  When I&#x27;m focused and looking for the &amp;#34;Zen-like&amp;#34; shaving &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll use the Feather. YMMV.</li>
    <li> Bought these before with no issues so I ordered again. I started using them awhile after I bought it and noticed that I was only getting 4 blades per pack, so I was shorted 20 blades total. I did not return it as they are so cheap, but I will never buy again.</li>
    <li> These blades are my favorite. I&#x27;ve tried many from BIC, Derby, Dorco, and Feather. These aren&#x27;t as sharp as the feather blades, but I feel they give me a closer shave and much less irritation than any other blades out there. Quality seems consistent as well</li>
    <li> I bought these because I decided to give my dad&#x27;s old safety razor a turn.  I&#x27;d had it for years, just sitting in the medicine cabinet. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the single blade, double-edge safety razor, so thought it would be interesting to compare with the multi-blade modern shaver I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad&#x27;s brass shaver is probably from the 1940s.  You turn a knob at the bottom of the handle, and the top opens and swings up so that the blade can be slipped over it onto the stem.  Another twist and the top swings back down into place to secure the razor in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the slot in the center of the razor does not exactly match the stem, so the fit is not perfect, and I have to wrestle the blade into position.  And who wants to wrestle with a very sharp razor blade?  I thought that all safety blades had the same size slot in the middle.  Guess not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in the shaver, the blade shaves okay.  Not as close for me as the triple-blade Gillette Mach 3.  Nor did these blades last as long for me as the Mach 3s.  Everyone&#x27;s face is different, but that&#x27;s my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could be the shaver, but seems like shaving technology really has advanced, and I found I had to be a LOT more careful with this shaver than the modern style.  Got a lot more nicks and cuts.  A shaving cut is something I hadn&#x27;t experienced in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these with a lather frothed up with a shaving brush and Taylor Avocado shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m sorry to say that I&#x27;ve gone back to the Mach 3.  I wish I&#x27;d only bought a small pack, but the 100 razor pack seemed so much more economical.  Only wish I could think of another practical use for them now.  )-:</li>
    <li> These are sharp, smooth and inexpensive double edge blades.  Recommended.  And if you still use a cartridge razor, throw it in the trash and get yourself a Merkur, Muhle, or Edwin Jager razor.</li>
    <li> like it so far, haven&#x27;t tried other brands yet but this thing works great. I get 2-3 days of shaving with one blade (I feel like I can even push it more, but I don&#x27;t want to.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a number of the variety packs which some of those blades work well. Based on the previous reviews for Astra Superior Platinum; sharp, excellent blades, etc, I have to say I am very disappointed. I don&#x27;t think my face or whiskers are dense or hard to shave. I have always had close shaves over the past years, even testing the various blades. Sometimes you find the nice sharp blades, they just don&#x27;t last but a few shaves. The Astra Superior Platinum blades don&#x27;t even feel or seem sharp the 1st time I use them. I am on my 3rd blade now, 2 weeks shaving 5 days per week. Even with a brand new blade, part of my neck whiskers are barely touched. They are shorter in length, however they don&#x27;t seem to grab those whiskers like most of the other blades do. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these blades at all, even with the very first shave. I use a boar hair brush and the same Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream which is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter 100 blades for $9.00, I bought the blades based on reviews of how sharp the blades are. So with a Merkur DE razor I thought this blade was my solution. Not the case and I&#x27;ve been using DE razors for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what I am missing here that all of these folks are RAVING about how sharp the blades are? Did I get a bad batch? Honestly with every other blade I&#x27;ve used, the front part of my neck has always been cleanly shaven. With these blades stubble, stubble and stubble exists.</li>
    <li> These are by far the most forgiving blades I&#x27;ve tried so far. They do not burn, but they go dull quite fast. I can only shave for about a week, every day or so.My favorites are still Wilkinson Sword. After 3 weeks of heavy abuse, they are still sharp.</li>
    <li> I have been using Derby&#x27;s for the past few weeks and while those are nice blades, the Astras do seem to be sharper and work with my face better. Very smooth shave out of my Edwin Jagger DE. No pulling or tugging...just nice, beard slicing performance at a great price per blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any nicks or weepers so far and the seller shipped them fast as lightning. Very good service/highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Astra SP (Superior Platinum) blades are great blades, in my opinion. As always, blade preference switches from person to person, but these ones here are loved by many. Smooth, sharp, and cheap. The most important thing is smoothness. For beginners and sensitive face folk, the smoothness factor is the most important variable in your choice of a purchase. Go pick up a Feather blade and test these two side by side. No doubt the Feather will feel sharper, but it&#x27;ll usually leave people with nicks and a blade-whipped face. The Astra SP is decently forgiving, smooth on the face, and pretty much the sharpest blade I have found that retains the smooth feel. If you are a beginner looking for a starter blade, try a sample pack or a pack of Derby blades. Derbys are not the sharpest around (all blades are sharp, but hopefully you know what I mean), but are very forgiving and smooth. Once you&#x27;ve mastered technique, come and check out these bad boys. Cost effective and efficient!</li>
    <li> These razor blades are awesome--just sharp enough, but not so sharp that you slice your face open every time you lightly snag the razor on some contour of your skin. Out of a sampler containing Astra, BlueBird, Feather, Gillette 7o&#x27;clock (super and platinum), Gillette Goal, Vidyut (super and platinum), Trig, Derby, and maybe a couple others, my favorites by far were Astra and Gillette. Of those two, the Astra were the cheapest and easiest to find.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the amount of blades for the price.  Makes shaving very cheap.  Blades are extremely sharp, which makes for a nice smooth shave.  These don&#x27;t irritate your skin like other blades and cause redness or bumps, but thats just for my skin as everyone has a different skin type.  I highly recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> These blades are fantastic in my 1959 Gillette Fatboy *and* in a brand new Edwin Jagger DE89lbl safety razor. The shave is smooth and the blades last for a good 5 shaves before starting to \\&quot;tug\\&quot;.  Some people have complained about the gummy spots on one side of the blade.  My guess is that it&#x27;s used to hold the paper wrappers in place (while in the package) which helps keep moisture out.  My fix is to simply put the gummy \\&quot;side up\\&quot; in the razor - no hair will get stuck on it then and cleaning is as simple as a few swishes in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these blades are excellent. I will certainly be buying them again.</li>
    <li> Been DE shaving for 2 months now, first bought a pack of blades that came with all the popular brands, there were 3 that stood out, Feather, 7-oclock (blue) and these. All three of those blades did very well for my skin so what it came down to was price, and these were beyond the best in that category. Will be buying these from now on.</li>
    <li> These blades give you an amazing, smooth, close shave with virtually no &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;. My husband and I both use a DE razor and although this is only the second brand we have tried, we really like them. They are great blades at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Love the blades.  Will but again.</li>
    <li> Really bad , nothing grows??????</li>
    <li> Razors are a personal choice.  Some people have coarse hair.  Some people have sensitive skin.  That describes me and this razor works for me.  When you are starting out with shaving using a safety razor, I highly recommend buying a sampler kit to see what works for you before you buy a supply of any one razor.  What works for someone else may not work for you, and if I had went with the first (or second or third...) razor I had tried, I probably would have given up and went back to an electric razor.  Some were too sharp and it too easy to draw blood or otherwise cause irritation, others were too dull and pulled hair.  For me, this was the Goldilocks razor.</li>
    <li> They are cheaper then buying disposable razors all the time.</li>
    <li> The razors are a little rough meaning I experienced a few nicks.</li>
    <li> These are sharp and give a very smooth shave. Highly recommended. Goes good with the Parker 99R razor, sold separately.</li>
    <li> 100 count for 10 bucks?? Long gone are the days of struggling with stretching out the use of those $18-a-pack Gillette blades. Because I was spending so much per pack, I was using the blades way after they should have been replaced, leaving me with a dull, rough shave that irritated my skin. These safety razors are so cheap, I can put in a new one every few days if I wanted to and still have one $10 box last a year or more. Huge money saver and you&#x27;re also getting a cleaner, better shave in the end. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> work good but not as sharp as id like it to be , will try a few more and if its better ill rewrite</li>
    <li> I love these blades. I was using the Shark blades, and they are good. But these are thicker, tougher, and sharper. So I get a much closer better quality shave. You can cut yourself much easier with these so keep that in mind. I have a few trouble spots on my face that usually get cut, but I don&#x27;t care. I don&#x27;t get razor burn or infected hair folicles anymore! So I can deal with a few nicks on my face.</li>
    <li> These blades are worth the price. they shave like any other blades that I have used in the past, viz wilkinson, gillete ets.&lt;br /&gt;So with a pack of 100, these shouls last a very long time before I buy more.</li>
    <li> I give these blades 5 star because of how smooth they are for how sharp they are.&lt;br /&gt;I use a Merkur 180 Long handle with the Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for safety razors blades.&lt;br /&gt;The only weird thing (not necessarily a bad thing) is that the blades are packaged with a little glue in them to keep them from sliding in the package. The glue has not interfered with my shaving quality at all.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, but why does it bleed when you use it?</li>
    <li> Blades last about 3 uses, I shave every other day too, which means these blades will last me more than a year. Considering I used to spend close to $20 a month on Gillette fusion cartridges... I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;These blades I prefer more than the Murkor, then seem to be more gentle on the skin while at the same time still cutting effortlessly. It did bike me once in the mustache area but that was my fault, not the blades.</li>
    <li> I bought sharp, cheap blades,  and I got sharp, cheap blades.</li>
    <li> Love these in my safety razor.  I have been using a safety razor for going on 7 months now.  I have become a fan of this, as I was using the Gillette Fusion, with 4 blades, I lost count how many they added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the safety razor lessens any razor bumps that I would have gotten after a week of shaving.  I personally have to shave every business day for work.  Sometimes I get the weekend off from shaving.  But, with the newer razor I would start to end of with razor bumps, no matter the preshave oils, or shaving creams that I used.  Its all from how close they get, and that they are taking the hair below the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started with a multi-pack of razors, that included I believe 18 different brands or styles of safety blades.  I found that some brands did not work with my face or hair.  Causing me to get more nicks than normal. I would only need one try with that blade to rule it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now down to three brands and styles that I rotate between. The Gilette 7 0&#x27;clock Platinum, Personna Platinum, and Astra Platinum.  I find all of these work wonderfully for me.  And I personally only use them for 3 or 4 shaves, and then put a new one on.  The cost is so much cheaper than any other blades out there for the more modern razors.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving, I ordered the razor, Astra blades and soap and all is going so well, I ordered my brother the same thing.</li>
    <li> love them, don&#x27;t waste your money on 30 dollars for 15 cartridges . What a rip off for consumers.&lt;br /&gt;Best decision ever</li>
    <li> I was seriously doubting whether or not straight razor shaving could actually give me a close shave until I used these blades. I went from Derby to these, so that&#x27;s all I have to compare to though.</li>
    <li> They are individually packed, so you only need to take a couple on trips. A tried and true design that is competitively priced.</li>
    <li> I find the Astra one of the most comfortable blades out in the market after spending a couple of months going through a sample pack I purchased on Amazon.  I find myself with far fewer nicks when using the Astra blades than compared to the super sharp Feather.  It is definitely not as sharp as Feather, but is a better cut than most other double edge blades out there.  It is far more comfortable than the Feather.  At 100 count for $15 this deal can&#x27;t be beat.  I bought the 30 count and wish I had seen this deal.  You may also want to try the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock.  I believe it is somewhat cheaper and comparable to the Astra.  Both are good when starting out with a double edge razor.  You can then move up to the Feather if you want to try something really sharp, but those blades are more expensive.  I also get between 3-4 shaves with the Astra.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the money</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!  Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I thought my husband was nuts when he suggested going to an old fashioned razor from all of the 4-5 blade razors I&#x27;d been trying.  Best idea he ever had!  I won&#x27;t be going back to spending fortune on fancy razors that don&#x27;t work because these are all I will buy from now on!</li>
    <li> best blades for the money. these are my everday go-go blades. great price, very comfy, and a good smooth blade for beginners.</li>
    <li> Astra Superior Platinum&#x27;s are very inexpensive are incredibly smooth and sharp and durable.  They seem to be consistent in every one of my razors and tend to last longer than several other blades I&#x27;ve tried.  They aren&#x27;t perfect, no....they aren&#x27;t the sharpest...but are by far not the dullest blades out there.  Very good every day razor blade....but, I would go with something else for special occassions.</li>
    <li> Saves money and works great!  Wish my husband would of bought these sooner!</li>
    <li> I just switched to Astra from Shark blades and I definitely prefer Astra. The blades feel sturdier and sharper. The blades come in cardboard boxes with 5 in each, so the packaging is not as cool as the little plastic boxes that the Shark blades come in. However, the blades are still individually wrapped in wax paper and the cardboard probably makes for less waste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades but Astras seem to work best for me.  Nice and smooth.  Not too sharp but not too dull.  And 100 blades for $11 bucks?!  THAT&#x27;S A DEAL!</li>
    <li> I have been a gillette mach 3 user for years since my teen years.  In the last year I switch over to safety razors and it is night and day.  I love the Astra blades and Derby&#x27;s.  100 pack will last me almost two years for 10-12 bucks.  Gillette was the costco pack every six months &#x3D; 120 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came back from vacation and tried my gillette on vacation.  God Almighty, that mach 3 left me with razor burn and irritation i come back and shave with my astra blades smooth and no irritation and no razor burn.</li>
    <li> Great price and great value.</li>
    <li> Blades work perfectly for my skin. Very satisfied with the price too!</li>
    <li> I love Double Edge Blade shaving.  As others have stated, you really should try these out before buying a 100 pack.  It is sharper than other blades I&#x27;ve used, gives me about 6 shaves before I replace the blade.  Much cheaper and closer shave than cartridge blades.&lt;br /&gt;Tips : Clean the blade and wipe off any liquid / oil will help extend use, but be very careful as these are sharp.</li>
    <li> Stays sharp and get plenty of shaves from one blade.Good product</li>
    <li> Excellent blades at a great price. I have always used the Mach 3 and newer razors. The cost was crazy high! My son finally talked me into trying a Mekur Safety Razor he have me along with these blades. It is a great way to shave.</li>
    <li> This is the worst blade I have ever used. It feels like its pulling hair like tweezers instead of shaving it. I had Gillette 7 O clock before that worked good for me I am sure there are better than Gillette 7 o clock out but If you don&#x27;t want to waste your time in searching for  the best blades then I would recommend Gillette 7 O clock.</li>
    <li> nice smooth cut everytime</li>
    <li> I was looking for razor blades at my local supermarket and realized that the blade makers have a pretty good thing going.  The safety blades were pricey, and the newer, fancier styles were crazy expensive.  So I decided to see what Amazon had to offer and found the Astras.  What did I have to lose at that price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, not only did I lose nothing, but I found a great shave.  From a cost perspective, if a blade gives me 3 shaves, then I have a year&#x27;s worth of shaves for about $10, and the blades usually last more than 5 shaves.  That reason alone is enough to give these blades a try, but it gets better.  The more I&#x27;ve used these the better my technique has gotten, and now my face is wonderfully smooth.  My son even asked me one night at tuck-in why I had just shaved when I hadn&#x27;t shaved since before breakfast.  Needless to say that whenever I do run out of Astra blades I will be buying another 100 pack!</li>
    <li> I purchased these razors to go along with my Double Edge Razor, works perfectly.  Sharp edge for clean and smooth shave. So far I like this item.</li>
    <li> These blades are the bomb! Super sharp and forgiving.  I got coarse hair and most blades tend to pull around chin area and these just glide on through.  I have found the blade that works for me.  Also I have sensitive skin and these blades are forgiving love it!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised as to how well it worked. Like others have said, I will probably never go back to a cartridge blade.</li>
    <li> Best of three types of blades I bought.  Astra gave 6-7 shaves, Gillette gave 3-4, and Dorco gave 2-3 shaves. Dorco blades came with the Shaving Factory razor I bought.</li>
    <li> It is amazing&lt;br /&gt;I like it</li>
    <li> Although I am new to safety razors, I have tried out a few brands of blades.  I was reluctant to buy a large quantity, but after looking at the reviews, I bought these.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Astra puts out a nice, sharp razor blade that lasts about 4-5 shaves for me, and does not cut me like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  Also, I have sensitive skin, and razor burn has not been an issue.  I would highly recommend these.  They are a great deal, and good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different blades with my Edwin Jagger: Feather blades are almost TOO sharp, they wear quickly, and they are quite pricey. Gillette Platinum were the closest to these and would be my second choice If I could no longer find these. They start sharp and smooth, are reasonably priced, and most importantly - they STAY sharp and smooth for longer than any other blade that I&#x27;ve tried. I can use one of these daily and not really have to change it out for about 2 weeks or so, where most other blades I can only get about a week at best. Gillette was a close second in this regard as well. With regards to PLATINUM vs STAINLESS: they both start out similar, but the platinum blades hold their edge for longer no matter what the brand.</li>
    <li> BBS shave with my EJ89!  See ya again in a year after i have used all 100 of the bad boys.</li>
    <li> Standard double edged razor blades. A GREAT value for the price. Work well with any razor, old or newly purchased.</li>
    <li> The cost of a double-edged safety razor is no more than $.11. It will provide a clean, close shave. as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Wilkinson, Gillette and personally I think they are all good. The Astra are as good, I use them on a Merkur 42c</li>
    <li> Poor quality control.  Have used about 10 blades so far and only 2 gave a decent shave.  The rest were mediocre and would be shot after the second use.  I started changing blades after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;You might want to look at other brands.</li>
    <li> I first purchased a sampler pack when I first started using a DE razor and I found these to be the best for my face.  I get an extremely close shave from them with very little irritation.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have ever used. Of course all razor blades are extremely sharp, but in razor blade terms these are definitely sharper than Dorco or Derby blades, but not as sharp as a Feather of course. I find the sharpness to be appropriate, and one blade lasts me over a week&#x27;s worth of shaves in my DE safety as well as my Shavette. The finished edge is very very smooth and enjoyable, where some of the Dorco blades I have used were not the smoothest feeling on the cutting edge, and Feathers can also have this problem. No corking is needed for these Astras. The only downside I can find is that the container does not have a used blade holder.</li>
    <li> Great value on disposable razors. This type of shaving will save you tons of cash when compared to buying regular blades. Get an adjustable saftey razor and use your saved money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> got to get use to it but works great in my samurai.</li>
    <li> These are incredible. I&#x27;ve been using another brand for several years. I could get ONE shave out of one. These I can get three before I have an issue. I definitely am very pleased. And will be stocking up.</li>
    <li> I was used to using the Wilkinson Sword brad from Wal-Mart until they stopped selling them in my local stores. I picked this brand out because of the reviews. I am so glad that I did. These blades are so smooth. They do not irritate my skin and they keep their sharpness a lot longer than my old brand. I will definitely be using this brand when they run out in two years.</li>
    <li> I found these blades to be sharp and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great price point at 16 dollars per 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice some wax glue on sealing the paper around the blade, but easily cleaned off.</li>
    <li> These Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades are an excellent buy.  I am getting 7 good smooth shaves or more from each blade and paying a fraction of what I have been paying in the past for my Schick Injector single blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy them in the 100 packs and I have tried them in two different razors.  They worked just fine in both.  They are individually wrapped in paper and 5 to a small box inside the large box.  It makes them convenient to use.  I also like the fact that they are easy to buy off Amazon, where my old system required looking high and low to try and find them the single injector blades at local stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had experience with Derby (not very good), Feather (super sharp), and Merkur (good middle of the road blade) razor blades before purchasing Astra Superior Premium Platinum blades. I was going to get another pack of Feather blades, but decided to give these a try based on their rating and lower price when compared to Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using them for a month or so, I have to say these are now my favorite blades. I feel I get a really close shave, but without the added nicks and cuts I occasionally got when using Feather blades, which are about the sharpest you can get. I think Feather blades feel a lot sharper, but the Astra blades still get the job done without the draw back of nicks and cuts that came with the super sharp Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong I would still give Feather razor blades 5 stars as well, I just prefer the Astra blade as it tends to be a more comfortable blade to use use and in general works better for me. I say they are the most comfortable for me based on next to zero nicks and cuts, and no razor burn.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a cheap bulk price. Blades are as good or better than any other I&#x27;ve used, including multi-cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> After buying a sampler pack of blades,I found that these were the smoothest shaving blades at the lowest price point. They worked great in my shavette and my DE. I seem to be able to get 4-6 shavers out of them shaving every 3 days. They aren&#x27;t as sharp as the feather blades (definitely the sharpest and smoothest blade I&#x27;ve used, but rather harsh and unforgiving), and they don&#x27;t cut through really coarse hair really well.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this, and haven&#x27;t tried a sampler pack yet, go do that first. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper to get 1 or 2 of each blade and find out what you don&#x27;t like than it is to buy 100 and not like them.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing. The blades are individually wrapped in both wax paper and a decorative paper wrapper, then packed in boxes of 5, then they boxes are packed into a carton of 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have noticed is that the blades tend to have glue overlapping onto the cutting edge. They still shave just fine, but it is annoying.</li>
    <li> Sharp edge, works well. What can I say its safety razor blades. Its a good value for qty 100 pack.</li>
    <li> These blades are amazing! They&#x27;re right in that Goldilocks zone, not too sharp, not too dull. I have a very thick and difficult to manage beard, but these are perfect for me. Wilkinson&#x27;s take way too many passes and irritate my skin, feathers cut a little too close, but a four way pass with the Astra takes off all the hair without irritating. And they last too, I can use one blade for two or three shaves with no problem. I would totally recommend these blades!</li>
    <li> These blades give a good close shave. I use a Arko shaving stick with my new badger shaving brush. :-)</li>
    <li> To me these are the second sharpest double edges on the market behind feathers.  If you just care about sharp these are the blades for you.  Given the fact that they are 1/5 the cost of feathers these are no brainers for me.</li>
    <li> Good razors, just not as sharp as Feather blades...but for the price cant complain either, they still do the job if you dont have an alternative!</li>
    <li> So here is how I test razors. Before, I only used derby&#x27;s and when I used a new blade on 3 days worth of growth, it worked perfectly fine. But if I tried to use the blade a 2nd time, the day after, I would get irritation and burning. I thought thats what it is and accepted it. Well I recently got these astras and on the 2nd shave I had none of that irritation or burning. These blades are fantastic, they are the perfect blend of sharpness and smoothness. I will finally be able to go back to shaving everyday, which I couldnt do with derby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Excellent deal. Extremely low price for above average blades. Would definitely buy again. The only caveat is that I wish they were manufactured in the US.</li>
    <li> When I began shaving with a safety razor, I jumped in head first and bought a 100-pack that I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in after a year of use.  In hindsight, I should have taken the recommended route of ordering a sample pack of various brands and seeing what worked for me.  However, I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with the Astra Superior Premium blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades give a smooth, lasting shave and are consistent performers when paired with a good cream and solid post-shave balm.  I would recommend that people new to DE shaving start with a sample pack; however, these are excellent blades and will be hard to beat.</li>
    <li> These razors are sharp enough to get the job done without tearing my face apart, what else do I need?</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have to keep my face shaven at work, which means I go through a lot of razor blades. For $10 this is close to a year long supply, and the blades are good quality. I can&#x27;t recommend these enough.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price!! I am enjoying the blades and would highly recommend these to any DE shaver. BUY THEM!!</li>
    <li> Nice and clean. Worked as advertised. Definitely will order again</li>
    <li> I use to buy these exclusively.  Now I buy the Wilkinson.  The Astra are less money and pretty forgiving on the face but the Wilkinson blade I get&lt;br /&gt;2 - 3x the use out of one blade and I have had no issues with cuts on the face from either of these brands.</li>
    <li> These are a great buy.  My husband is very happy with them, as he had looked everywhere in our area and could not find even one double edge blade.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> So first of all, there is a bit of wax on the blades - but honestly, I don&#x27;t see what the problem is. Usually when I open the blades I just wipe it off with my fingers, or if I forget to do this, the blade just goes right into the razor and everything is good to go. I&#x27;m not shaving with the inside of the razor, and if it gets &amp;#34;gunked up,&amp;#34; I just clean it later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor blades are sharp, thin, and do a fantastic job of shaving (and cutting my fingers if I&#x27;m not careful). They work much better than the Wilkinson blades I was buying from Walmart for over twice the price.</li>
    <li> Mildy Disappointing. Does not have the sharp razor edge as advertized.</li>
    <li> I have found the astra blades to be the best all around shave.  Feathers are great but they are so crazy sharp they can be irritating.  Astra ate balance, long lasting and cheap which makes then my choice</li>
    <li> After having bought my first ever safety razor, naturally I needed blades. In the spirit of full disclosure I&#x27;m Caucasian with a light beard/facial hair so my review may not fit everyone. The Merkur I purchased came with a Merkur blade. Was far smoother than a cartridge but still a bit of pull. Been using the Astra now for a bit and have been very happy. I get 4-5 shaves per blade and only change them out of habit. Don&#x27;t think you can go wrong on these.</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck razor deal on Amazon.  Very sharp, and honestly, they&#x27;re so cheap you can use a fresh blade for one or two shaves and throw it out and get a perfect shave every time and it&#x27;s still WAY less than buying Mach 3s from the store.  I usually get 3-4 shaves from each blade, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I made the switch from mainstream cartridges to these traditional blades and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. They are the best double-edge blades I&#x27;ve found by far. I get a better shave without irritating my skin and this large pack will last me for about two YEARS if I just change the blade once a week. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Great blades, but remember there are 100 of them!!!  I usually get 2 weeks of shaves out of one blade so I&#x27;m set for 200 weeks (almost 4 years).  These are the same razors my dad used so the nostalgia may have moved this from a 4 to 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy the 4-count unless you are a grizzly, lumberjack who needs a new blade every shave!</li>
    <li> Great razor. I have sensitive skin so a super sharp blade will leave me bumps. I also have a very think beard and need a super sharp blade. This blade is very sharp yet gentle enough to not leave any bumps.</li>
    <li> Great value and a provide a clean shave.</li>
    <li> I love these blades.  Great shave and a fantastic value. I have been on the same pack for over two years.  For $10.  Come on.</li>
    <li> Using an old school razor and these I have saved literally hundreds and hundreds of dollars</li>
    <li> Just bought my second 100 pack after nearly 3 years.  I get one blade to last through 3-4x shaves per week.  I generally only change the blade on Mondays.  These blades give a nice smooth shave and won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> though these blades might be dangerous to the uninitiated , they work like a charm . and the price can&#x27;t be beat</li>
    <li> All blades are in good condition.</li>
    <li> OK blades,  too many nicks , don&#x27;t last more than a couple of shaves.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave, every time. Much better than derby!!</li>
    <li> For the price you can not beat these. All total you will have about 100 weeks of shaving from this box. Have had no quality issue with the balde in terms of cutting up my face.</li>
    <li> Excellent value and quality.</li>
    <li> I tried probably 6 different blades for my safety razor before buying these.  The Astra&#x27;s are night and day different, better than all the others I tried by a wide margin. My shave is very close and surprisingly comfortable, it&#x27;s hard to believe a little slip of metal could be so different than other little slips of metal. For $11 you can get a year&#x27;s worth of shaves. These were recommended to me and I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who uses a safety razor.</li>
    <li> No skin irritation, for first time user of a double edge razor. Also no nicks or cuts and I&#x27;ve only been using them for two weeks now.</li>
    <li> Fantastic blades!  I have went through many different brands, but Astras are always consistently the best.  Also you cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> Although these are the first and only blades I have used, I can&#x27;t see any other blade being any better.  I am able to shave at a relatively &#x27;fast&#x27; pace without too many issues.  I do get a nick here and there, but that is almost surely my fault and not the blades.&lt;br /&gt;I use each blade twice.  They are so cheap that it probably wouldn&#x27;t hurt to only use once, but, since the second shave feels just as good as the first shave with it, I figure why throw away a decent blade?  However, when I tried a third shave, it felt noticeably different and I got an unusual amount of nicks.  Two is my limit!  If you aren&#x27;t super cheap like me, just use them once.</li>
    <li> these blades are much better than the Merkur blades that I was using which were a lot more expensive than the Astra.  They shave just as close as the Merkur and I dont get nicked near as much with these. Offering me a better product at a lower price is the way to insure more orders. This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> These blades are a fantastic item.  Sharp, smooth, and dirt cheap.  These easily compare to much more expensive blades (They are made in the same factory as most Gillette DE blades).  The packaging is all recyclable, and the blades themselves are a treat to use.</li>
    <li> these are my go to blades...smooth, sharp, and affordable.  I&#x27;ve tried about 7 or 8 different blades and these are the ones I keep coming back to....you can&#x27;t beat the price and quality.  You have to try a lot of blades in different razors...but these are the ones I know I can count on.</li>
    <li> I have been using Derby for 6+ months now but these blades are indeed superior. The blades are thin but sharp. There is no drag and there is not need to shave twice. I used to replace the Derby blade after 2 uses but these blades last me 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that they come in paper boxes and there is no place for discarding old blades.</li>
    <li> These work pretty good for me. Remember that blades work differently on people&#x27;s faces. I get 2-3 shaves out of each blade. If you are not sure, order a sample pack from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Husband is old school and loves this double edge.  Hard to find blades in store so this seemed like a good value and good reviews.</li>
    <li> Product is as described and would not mind recommending to friend or wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing some more in the future</li>
    <li> To me the blades are just okay. They dull pretty fast in my opinion, after just a couple of shaves. I would suggest using Merkur blades, they last a lot longer. It&#x27;s like anything else, you get what you pay for. I wouldn&#x27;t by any means say not to buy them, but just know that you won&#x27;t be getting top notch quality.</li>
    <li> Works better than the original razor blades that came with my new razor handle.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a tremendous value.  For me each blade lasts a week (4 to 5 shaves) and i go over my face 3 times every shave.  They are very sharp - not the very sharpest, but sharp enough. 100 blades is 2 year supply for me. The savings over regular razor blades (at 2.50 a pop) is huge.  Probably not the best blade, but a very good one and the best for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was looking for a better deal than my local pharmacy ($8 for 15 blades). I paid $11 for a box of 100 and was pleasantly surprised. Assuming you can also get 3-5 shaves per blade, you will get consistently good shaves for 2-4 cents a day.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this product I read all the reviews and assume just because they had a lot of good reviews that the product has to be great. One thing that really stood out in the one star reviews was the fact that the razor was a little doll and Woodleave box on your face, it definitely does that.  SHAVE SHARK is much better. I got 5 free with the handle that I bought,  it works great.  You cannot return this product.</li>
    <li> Great shave for an affordable price. I have 6 cut throat straight razors and I can never get them as sharp as these. I use a Merkel head with a 1950&#x27;s Gillete ball handle and these work great. I will buy again when I run out as these come in handy when I don&#x27;t have time to strop a blade out.</li>
    <li> Comprei a caixa com 100 Astra Superior Platinum premium duplo Safety Razor Edge Blades, pois alem de um ótimo preço, alas possuem um fio nítido e confortável.</li>
    <li> I started DE shaving 2 years ago and I have been using Derby blades until I decided to give Astra Platinum a try.  These blades are very smooth and they do a wonderful job.  They are much better than Derby IMHO.  For the extra $1 or so they are definitely worth it.  I get an amazing shave from them.  No tugging or pulling.</li>
    <li> Everyone will be different when it comes to blades. But for me, these Astra&#x27;s are amazing, especially for the price! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I decided to go old school and starting using a double edge razor again. I have used one blade so far without any problems. I like these blades.</li>
    <li> new favorite blade. Really really smooth!</li>
    <li> For anyone who is tired of paying through the nose for cartridge razor blades, then take another look at double edge blades. They are very cheap but do an excellent job if you take your time. This particular blade is marketed by Proctor and Gamble who are the same people who are reaming us out on the cartridge blades. They sell these in emerging markets, as for some you either have a shave with cartridge blades or you get to eat lunch. Double edge blades are a step backwards but also a step forward, your shaving regime has to change, it takes more time but the results are first class. $10.00 or less for 100 blades delivered to your door cannot be beaten.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better than a fresh, clean shave.  At this price you can afford to change your blades regularly, without breaking the bank.  These blades are great for your face, and for your wallet too.</li>
    <li> These blades are decent for the price however the shave is not as comfortable as other blades on the market. I&#x27;m going to switch back to the blades from the Art of Shaving store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Super cheap&lt;br /&gt;- Get 100 for less than $15&lt;br /&gt;- Comes in small boxes, perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not as sharp as other blades&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t last as long as others</li>
    <li> Great blades, they seem to be a little sharper than the other brand and hold an edge longer. I would highly recommend this brand!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers:)</li>
    <li> man they are sharp! thanks guys and gals!</li>
    <li> These are much sharper than the Derby blades I had been using previously.  I haven&#x27;t tried Feather yet, so I can&#x27;t speak as to how these compare to those.  One thing that I did notice is that these blades seem to lose their edge fairly quickly.  After about 3 shaves, I need a new blade with these, while I could usually get 5-6 shaves out of Derby or Wilkinson blades.</li>
    <li> These give me a great shave and maybe I won&#x27;t be so stingy about replacing my blades since I have so many.</li>
    <li> Saves me so much money over cartridge razors!</li>
    <li> I love these blades. I have very thick bear hair that requires a full shave session every couple of days. I actually had broken two electric shavers years ago because they couldn&#x27;t handle the manly face stubble! These go perfectly with the Merkur safety razor .&lt;br /&gt;I can make these blades last for quite a while, and at this cost, I&#x27;ll certainly be buying more when needed. With the 100 blades, I can get probably get close to 300 shaves, depending on length between shavings.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly reccommend these blades to anyone looking for other options to get away from the 5-blade system.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using these blades as they are very sharp; almost as sharp as Feather from my experience. They provide a very close shave that lasts. My girlfriend loves how smooth and soft my face is after shaving with this razor.</li>
    <li> Great blades and at great price.</li>
    <li> Having tried various blades for my DE razor, the Astra premium platinum seem to strike the right balance between being aggressive and not too blunt for my thick beard.</li>
    <li> I had been trying to match my new razor Merkur &amp;#34;1904&amp;#34; Classic Safety Razor (the Handle) Made in Germany with an Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor (Head) Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome to the right blade for sometime. the best two that I have found are the Astra and the Feather. you get more nicks with the Feather but less with the Astra! Thanks Amazon you ARE the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will, Texas</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still fairly new to using safety razors. These blades seem to do a good job and they showed up to my door on time.</li>
    <li> If one uses Double edge Razor Blades, he cannot do better with anything other than the Astra Platinum Double Edge Razor Blade.&lt;br /&gt;One blade will last for at least THREE good, clean shaves.  Very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Jay Browen</li>
    <li> does what it is intended for. good quality. will keep buying again. able to have a new blade every time.&lt;br /&gt;now i don&#x27;t have to wonder when it is time to change the blade or find out its time by having a blade catch my skin.&lt;br /&gt;have skin prone to acne as well so having a new blade every time is perfect.</li>
    <li> These blades are great! I have had a lot of problems with other blades as my skin is very sensitive but I very rarely get razor bumps with these blades. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very excellent quality blades, though I can&#x27;t get more than two shaves out of each blade without feeling some serious discomfort. I shave daily.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried them all!! Pro glide... hydra..  mach 3.. mach 5 .. double blades.. quattro and absolutely NOTHING would help my ridiculousness of ingrown hairs and razor bumps.  I&#x27;ve paired these with a Van Der Hagen safety razor and I love it!!!!  very slick shave and cuts as great as any of the 4+ bladed disposables&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; gotta go slow or you will nick yourself a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the best part is NO MORE razor bumps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I will never go back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S.  if you were wondering I get about 3-4 uses per blade.  so this one purchase will serve me well over a year!!!  awesome value</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m ordering this product. I change blades after every 2 shaves so it wont get dull and cut my skin. I never had a cut yet and find these blades to be awesome!  Every person is different so be careful. If you have a full or heavy beard, Id suggest cutting the hair (if you choose) with a electric razor first then using the blades for a close shave. I will continue buying these blades.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp smooth and very affordable, whats not to love about them they are definitely my favorite blades try&#x27;em out!</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving. I bought a sampler pack of blades and have been working my way through the different options over the last few months. I was getting so much razor burn that I was getting close to giving up and going back to the cartridges, then I opened the Astra blades. Finally, a smooth shave where I didn&#x27;t feel the blade tugging on the hairs constantly. If you&#x27;re looking for a new blade, these are definitely worth a shot. The price point is fantastic too. Shave twice and replace.</li>
    <li> The price for these blades is unbeatable. I&#x27;d say my Merkur and Wilkinson blades probably give me a better shave, but I bought these a while back for around $14. For 100 blades, that is excellent, and the shave is very good. Even just a decent double edge safety razor is way better than 5 blade cartridges, which cost you much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting between 3 and 5 shaves from each blade, and I shave everyday or every other day. So for $11 you can shave for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt I&#x27;ve gotten at least 2 duds, just really bad razors, out of the first 20 I&#x27;ve used. Even on the first shave it was horrible. But it&#x27;s not a big deal and you can&#x27;t complain with what you pay. Just throw it out and use another.</li>
    <li> I use these blades in my safety razor every morning, they always give me a great, smooth, and soft shave. I swap out blades once a week, so 100 blades will last me a long time. Even on the seventh shave with these razors they still give no irritation. I have gone up to two weeks on one blade, but that gets a little rough.</li>
    <li> Medium sharpness but not great for a thick beard. Good to learn with or use when you don&#x27;t have time</li>
    <li> I only shave when I need to, about every five days or so.  This blade is working well for me, better than the other brand that I was using, so I&#x27;m glad I bought them.  I&#x27;m getting about a month of shaving from each blade, so these should last me a long time.</li>
    <li> These blades are the winner for me. Though I&#x27;m sure there are sharper blades out there, these are sharp enough and durable enough for a so new wet shaver like myself. I will eventually give feathers a try if/when the price difference is smaller. As of right now they are around three times as expensive and as good a shave as I&#x27;m getting now I really can&#x27;t see a justification for it.</li>
    <li> It does a decent job.  I have been using these/similar blades for two decades.  I have come to know what to expect.  I actually use Astra blades twice before discarding unlike the single use I got from the local store bought one.  100 blades for about $10, you cannot beat it. Actually, the one good thing about this particular brand is no razor burns.  Even the fancy 700 blade contraptions sold for about $45 for 12 to 16 catridges gave me only three shaves before tugging and pulling.  So no complaints.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied. The shave is great on my rough beard. And you can&#x27;t beat the value, $10 for enough razors to last half a year!</li>
    <li> Ever since I made the switch from lathering with the canned gel crap to a soap and brush, I was always tempted to try a straight razor.  Unfortunately, the starting cost to purchase a good straight razor and keep it maintained was out of my budget.  Instead, I purchased a Dovo Shavette and decided to just snap the DE blades in half.  I&#x27;ve tried Merkurs, Derby&#x27;s, and Wilkinson Swords, but these Astra&#x27;s are the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Merkurs and Wilkinson Swords are sharp and my face didn&#x27;t take too kindly to them, so I knew Feathers would be out of the question.  Derby&#x27;s are too mild and felt as if they were pulling, rather than cutting.  These Astra&#x27;s are the best of both worlds.  Sharp enough to last 3-4 shaves, but mild enough to give me a three pass shave without any cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I use them in a shavette, I only need half of a blade, so I technically get 200 blades.  Each blade lasts about 3-4 shaves... if I were to shave every day, I would have enough blades to last me just over two years.  For $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eat your heart out Mach 3 and Fusions.</li>
    <li> nice blades really smooth no nicks or cuts with these ones,i would buy these again. they deserve five stars oh yea!</li>
    <li> In a butterfly razor these shave smoother than anything else.  They are terrific value for money too.  An Atra blade costs nearly $3. These are a fraction of that price and give a superior shave.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands but these are great to me.  They feel extra smooth and usually can do a whole shave on one half blade, but i dont have really coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I get a great shave every day with ASTRA. I have only tested aganist the baldes that came with my razor since I&#x27;m new at double edge shaving. However, they give me a much better shave than the competion. I get five shaves per blade and feel I could get many more. But at the Amazon price why push it, enjoy splurging. I plan to buy a double edge razor and 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades for each of my three sons-in-law this christmas.</li>
    <li> The only blades I&#x27;ve found to stay sharp for more than one or two shaves.  Also, I found them to be a bit sharper out of the box than some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about a month new to DE shaving, and I&#x27;ll never go back.  However, the road hasn&#x27;t always been easy.  Getting the proper technique down has occasionally been a painful test of trial and error.  I heeded the recommendation to buy a sampler pack of blades.  There were 7 different blades of some of the most-asked-for and most expensive.  After much experimenting with all of the blades and techniques, I found that the expensive \\&quot;super premium platinum\\&quot; etc. etc. blades like feathers and bluebirds consistently ate my face up and turned it into ground chuck no matter what I did.  They&#x27;re simply too sharp, which seems like an oxymoron.  The regular, \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; blades all smoothly shaved my face without irritation or nicks (for the most part).  Of all of them, I settled between Derby&#x27;s and these Astras.  In testing them both out several times during the same shave, I came to the following conclusion:  Derby&#x27;s are a gentler shave, but they also don&#x27;t cut as close.  These Astras feel a little harsher, but they are a noticeably closer shave than the Derby&#x27;s, which outweighs the 2 cents I&#x27;d be saving if I went with Derby&#x27;s.  So this will be my blade of choice (and thankfully so, because Feathers can run in the .40/blade range, even for packs of $100).</li>
    <li> This is a top grade product. Nice blades and give a close shave. Would purchase again, and fast shipment. Enjoyed doing business!</li>
    <li> I already have seen my ingrown hairs and bumps reduce since switching from the cartridge shavers. Easy to use but takes more time. Never once cut myself.  The shaves are smoother with less effort.  Pair it with a shaving soap like proraso</li>
    <li> These seemed dull at first, so I started spending up to 20 minutes carefully wetting, warming, and lathering my skin in preparation.  It didn&#x27;t help.  Even a newly opened blade is so dull that it just scrapes the skin without cutting the hair.  Now I have 90 of these left unopened that I wasted money on.</li>
    <li> These blades tore my face up, a very rough and irritating shave at best, I DO NOT recommend these blades. If you are trying to go cheap try the derby blades, they are much better!</li>
    <li> I would use a 5 bladed disposable and had to throw it out every two days. My beard was too tough on them and instead of cutting they start pulling out my beard. Switching to these double edged blades i can afford to get a new blade every day if i wanted but two days is what works for me. It took me a couple weeks before i completely switched over to these (i wasnt sure if i&#x27;d like it) but now that i have the hang of it i wont go back. It might take a little longer to shave but it is much closer also. Its the best move I&#x27;ve done in a long time.</li>
    <li> Cheap for a box of blades, but they don&#x27;t hold an edge as long as some of the others do.</li>
    <li> My standard blade has been Derby Extra for quite some time.  This Astra blade is quite sharp and comfortable.  When I use these blades I probably will only be doing two passes instead of my customary three.  The keen smooth edge on the skin reminds me of using Feather blades (which are sharper than I need and much more expensive than Astra or Derby).  I would order these again even though I am still more than pleased with my stock of Derby Extras.</li>
    <li> Great razor blades, love the packaging, and really love the price.  These typically last me about 7 shaves which means I&#x27;m essentially paying $10 for 2 years of razor blades.  Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these blades for shaving and edge ups. Works very well for thick hair and is lasting</li>
    <li> Fantastic blades. Superior to any other I have used in 70 years!</li>
    <li> (My review of the Astra blade is contained herein.)  Here&#x27;s how to shave: Think of two possible end results: They are (to use the phrases you see on the forums) a “Baby&#x27;s Butt Smooth” shave (BBS for short – 3 passes), and a “Socially Acceptable Shave” (SAS – 2 passes).  Are you getting married today? Consider doing a 3-pass BBS. For the other 99% of your life, do a 2-pass SAS shave.  Also (and this will sound like heresy to some): You don&#x27;t need to use a shaving brush. Why? Because it&#x27;s wasteful, and not worth the effort.  Most important things to remember: - Hydrate your facial hair before cutting it. The best time to shave is after a shower – it is believed that human hair is harder to cut than copper of the same width. Hydrating the hair makes it way easier to cut. - Keep your blade bone-dry between usages. Loosen the razor, dry the blade with a hair dryer, and keep it in another room away from moisture. Corrosion is the biggest factor in blade degradation.  Here is how I shave: - Shower - Fill sink with warm water. Don&#x27;t make it any hotter than you need! Heat removes moisture from your skin. The water temperature of your shower, and your shave, should be as close to cold as you can stand. For shaving, that means warm water. Filling the sink not only uses less water than running the tap while you shave - it keeps the heat of the water you put on your face, and the heat of your metal razor, consistent. - On damp face, apply a light layer of fragrance-free [[ASIN:B000GAXILM Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin, Fragrance Free, 16 Ounce (Packaging May Vary)]] (layer 1) - Wet face with warm water from the sink (layer 2) - With fingers, apply [[ASIN:B000FQ2C8M Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, Fragrance Free, 11 oz]] (layer 3) - Make first pass. Remind yourself that this first pass is a rough draft. -- I use a Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor (simple, easy to grip when wet) -- Astra is my preferred blade, the best balance between sharpness and smoothness that I&#x27;ve found. I also like PolSilver Super Iridium. I&#x27;ve tried Feather (ultra-sharp, but unforgiving), Derby (awful - stay away), Merkur (too dull), CVS house brand (not at all bad, actually), and a couple others I&#x27;ve forgotten. - Mentally repeat the word “light, light, light...” to yourself while shaving. Apply ZERO muscular pressure on your face. The weight of the razor should do ALL of the work. --With the grain, against the grain, or sideways to grain? On this first pass, do what feels right, but err on the side of with the grain. - Empty sink / rinse face / refill sink. - Apply more Moisture Shave (layer 3) - Make second – and LAST – pass. Take your time. The only difference from first pass is that you may carefully go over challenging areas one extra time, MAYBE two extra times. Be a bit more thorough. Get everything. Again, mentally repeat the word “light, light, light...” to yourself while shaving. Again, apply ZERO muscular pressure. -- Go against the grain. - You&#x27;re done. If you feel like you could have done better in some areas, let it go, and try to do better next time. - Dry the razor / razor blade with a hair dryer, store it in another room if you can. - Remember – the goal is not to have the most incredibly close shave every day of your life; the goal is to have a good, SAS with NO RAZOR BURN and NO NICS OR CUTS WHATSOEVER. None. Zero. You want your face to feel like you could do it again in one hour – like you DIDN&#x27;T EVEN SHAVE. This is something you&#x27;ll never feel after raking your face with one of these multi-blade systems they sell, and it&#x27;s something you also won&#x27;t feel if you cut up your face trying to do a 3-pass BBS.  You&#x27;ll notice that there is no mention of using a shaving brush. That&#x27;s because the supposed “benefit” of applying lubrication with a brush (“it raises the hair up, prepares the hair, blah blah blah”) is not remotely worth the cost (the time it takes to do it, the waste of lubrication whichstays in the brush and goes down the drain, the time spent cleaning the brush and bowl after). Simply put, using a brush to apply the lubrication is just a time-consuming, lubrication-consuming, mini-spa-treatment thing. Want to prepare the hair before cutting it? Take a shower to hydrate it.  Finally, dispose of your blades properly. Don&#x27;t just throw them in the garbage – that&#x27;s irresponsible. Use a blade bank – they&#x27;re dirt cheap. Cheap options include an empty metal Altoids can, or a plastic gum bin (another reviewer has one pictured - good idea!). And, of course, you can buy them as well.  Enjoy your shave, and get on with your life.  EDITED 9/3/15 TO ADD:  Regarding my admonition against 3-pass shaving: In truth, I have exaggerated a bit. There are times when one may want to do a 3rd pass. If you have gone several days without shaving, then sure, a 3rd pass can certainly be helpful. But when waking up and shaving every day, a 2-pass shave is more than enough. Think of a 3-pass shave as a special thing; the exception, not the rule. For me, a 3rd pass – no matter how light and careful I&#x27;m shaving – almost always results in at least a little bit of razor burn, somewhere on my face. If you&#x27;re going to do a 3rd pass just try to make it as “light” as you possibly can.  Regarding the comment about going against the grain: DE (Double Edge) shaving means shaving with a SINGLE blade. (The blade is double-edged, and you are only shaving with one of those edges.) Because it is a single blade, there is no “tug-and-cut” effect, which is present on any multi-blade razor. Shaving against the grain with a multi-blade is hard on the face because of the tug-and-cut. Shaving against the grain with a single blade is far less hard on the face (it&#x27;s cut-only).  Additional tips: Use an old toothbrush to clean your razor between blades. Whatever lubrication you use will build up, and you need to clean it regularly.  When your Kiss My Face pump bottle (or any pump bottle) stops pumping, you still have a significant amount of lubrication in there. Use a utility razor blade to cut open the bottle, just above where the lubrication is. When shaving, just use your fingers to get it out. Store this little “bin” of lubrication in a snack size sandwich bag between shaves.  Finally: Many of the advocates of DE shaving seem to be preoccupied with proving how close they can shave with DE shaving (see youtube). I think this is misguided. (There&#x27;s one guy on there who does four passes, and is bleeding all over the place. Ridiculous.) The fact is, if closeness is the goal, a multi-blade razor is always going to win that battle, because “tug-then-cut” allows you to cut the hair lower than the surface of the skin. But there is a cost: razor burn every time, lots of money, and lots of waste ending up in our environment.  Finally II: If you want to see how much hydration can make a difference, shave right after a heavy work out (then shower). The half-hour or so of sweat will really soften the hair. Even better is right after a swim.</li>
    <li> When I decided to stop investing nearly $450+ dollars a year on fancy razors and quick shaves, I shifted to single blades and slightly longer enjoyable shaves, I never looked back. These razors are hands down the best I have used, i go through one razor a week. 100 razors &#x3D; 100 weeks which &#x3D; roughly 50 fusion razors give or take. Do math much? No discount double checks needed here to save money.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the price..I am getting 10 shaves per blade!!</li>
    <li> I have gone back to double edge shaving after over 25 years of using the pulling, biting, extremely expensive cartridge style razors.  I had become so used to them that I never realized how bad they were - double edge blades smoothly &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; the whiskers off, where the cartridges yank and chop...including skin... That being said, after using a sample pack of a little over a dozen different blades, and finding the majority of them practically unusable,  the ones I found comfortable enough for my skin where the the Astra Platinum, Feather, and the Gillette Blue.  The Feather blades are great and just as sharp as most people say, and unless very careful, I would tend to nick myself easier.  The Astra and Gillette are also sharp and very smooth, but I get fewer nicks with just as close a shave. It boiled down to longevity - I found I could get from 4-6 comfortable shaves with the Astra blades and about half that many with the Gillette before having to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course all faces are different, so as they say: YMMV.</li>
    <li> My skin really reacted poorly to these; ingrown hairs, irritation, it was a mess. Everyone is different and my reaction may not be indicative to yours.</li>
    <li> Really fantastic blades. Before I was using the stock that came with my razor, which were rough and not gentle on my skin. When I purchased these ones, the change was really notable. Silky smooth (like good butter spread on pread) shave motions, no dragging effect at all, basically, way better than before. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Sharp enough that you don&#x27;t feel the blade, no tugging what so ever. Smooth as the dullest blade in the market! Just a great combination to make it one of my favorites. Sometimes you forget there is blade in the razor which only possible bt combining sharpness and smoothness!</li>
    <li> Possibly and probably my new go to blade. Great shave.  I will be purchasing more of these soon for stock.</li>
    <li> I love user reviews! This product turned out to be exactly as everyone described! I, for myself, believe it to be the perfect balance of performance and value, period. If your shave angle is correct and you have an average (on the aggressive scale) razor, this blade does what most reviewers on Amazon have stated. So thank you to ALL of the previous reviewers, it really does help everyone to navigate through the plethora of products to choose from! I think you have done a great job in helping everyone come to good decisions on products for them. Some people don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t compromise, and most of you were explicit enough to describe the areas you saw to be slight compromises, so, thank you! Feather blades are by most people&#x27;s accounts the sharpest in the world, would they be for you? Maybe, but you have to try. If you can&#x27;t decide go for Amazon&#x27;s sampler packs of blades and choose the perfect one for you! As for me these are what I wanted! A great shave with a sharp blade and with comfort and an un-beatable price! Anyone women or men can use these with confidence AND save some money for a nice Edwin Jagger DE 89 BL from Amazon! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> These blades are the best I have used.  I&#x27;ve used Derby and Wilkenson Sword Germans and these make those look dull.  I decided to get 100 of them so I won&#x27;t run out for a long time.  So worth it.</li>
    <li> ... And I now have a runaway new favorite. I&#x27;ve been a double-edge/safety razor shaver off an on for my entire shaving life (~35 years and counting), and the Astra&#x27;s are just like no other blade I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried many. Up until now, I&#x27;ve been okay with Derby blades, but on a whim, and after reading so many positive reviews, I ordered these. From the very first stroke (using my somewhat new Edwin Jagger razor), I was amazed. Smooth, precise, and CONSISTENT. This latter comment is about the consistency-of-feel on both sides of the razor. With most every other blade I&#x27;ve tried, especially the Derby&#x27;s, one side of the razor would have a smoother, closer shave than the other. With the Astra&#x27;s, both sides are incredibly smooth-shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For durability, these seem completely average, and I&#x27;m fine with that. I get five good shaves (my face doesn&#x27;t present a difficult challenge for a blade) before I dump the blade into my recently-acquired Feather blade disposal case (GREAT way to deal with old blades), and load up another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now eager to try the Astra blades with some of my vintage Gillette razors. I&#x27;m confident the shave will be like it has never been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great blade. A bit smoother than the Astra SS for me. This SP is my favorite blade and all I use now.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades having never used a DE razor before. I have to say they give an excellent shave and I have somehom managed to not cut myself even once so far. Good product, great price.</li>
    <li> Astra Superior Platinum Double Edge razors and it works like a charm. I&#x27;ve tried different blades ( i.e Feather, Merkur and others) but the Astra are by far the best. The blades are extremely sharp and they glide over your skin like Will Ferrell glides over the ice in Blades of Glory. It is an angelical experience to shave with these blades. I feel reborn with my smooth-like-a-baby&#x27;s-bottom face.</li>
    <li> I find that there are better blades out there but these are pretty good blades. I know blades are very subjective and some people love these blades while others can&#x27;t stand them. I&#x27;ve heard that you have to be careful because there are knock offs of these and other blades out there. You have to buy from a trusted seller. I must have the real deal because these blades perform well for the price I paid for 100 blades. I find that they are pretty sharp and I can get about 5 shaves from each blade. There are better blades out there but they are not at this price point. To me these Astra blades are a great value.</li>
    <li> Nice combo of performance and price, I typically use a blade for a month shaving every 2 to 4 days, at this rate I bought about 8 years supply of blades for less than 3 refills cost for those cartridge razors the corporations find so profitable...</li>
    <li> Work well in a new production safety razor. Much cheaper than multi blade refills.</li>
    <li> These reasonably-priced blades provide a smooth, close shave that seems to be as good as any I have tried.  I can recommend them to anyone wanting to save some money and still get a good shave.  They also were shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I found these to be very sharp-not feather quality but close. I paid $12 for a 100 and with a minimum of 4 shaves per blade that is 3 cents per. I did not find the wax to be an issue. I wish it had a container for the old blades but that is easily remedied.</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  Some time ago, my wife purchased a fancy schmancy shaving gift set for me and it included a safety razor.  After experimenting with a couple of blades that came with it, I found this product.  At a dime per blade, I use it twice and dispose.  More cost effective than even the cheapest disposable cartridge razor, the only thing I have to do is make sure I&#x27;m fully awake and take my time.  The shave is superb.</li>
    <li> Nice blades and super thin.</li>
    <li> Great product and for the right price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> These are my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; blade after trying about a dozen different blade types. The quality is consistent and the price is great. 100 blades will probably last me the next 5 years considering the rate I use them.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me in 2013 along with a Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor. This box comes with 100 razors, and I still haven&#x27;t run out yet. (Note: I use the razor a few times before exchanging it.) Good product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Definitely a nice blade for the price. I&#x27;m able to get 2-3 uses per blade. Would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all with these... They dull far too quickly; I&#x27;m lucky to get 2 shaves from each blade. C+.</li>
    <li> I just used these for the first time tonight.  They are CRAZY sharp and they made my legs so smooth.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I ordered these along with the Merkur Safety Razor for my adult son after having ordered another similar product online from an &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; ad.  My son absolutely LOVES this product, the ease of using it and especially the price.</li>
    <li> No question that if you like sharp blades, this is the brand for you. Very comfortable in vintage gillette or new EJ /Muhle razors. One of these will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Made the switch to DE razor not long ago and went with these based on price and reviews.  They give a pretty close shave and I can usually get 4 good shaves before they start to dull.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I love these blades and use them to shave my head and beard. this pack is cheap and sharp! the shave is so pleasant i find myself looking forward to the ritual of shaving. a great value for extremely high quality blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those (mostly Scot) guys with dark blonde/light brown hair but a red beard.  Thick, curly facial hair that shows a 5:00 shadow.  If you&#x27;re like me, you will probably like these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention this because I think the whole &amp;#34;buy an assortment of blades and keep notes&amp;#34; is way beyond the amount of time and effort I wanted to expend, and I really appreciated the reviews that stated racial and beard growth info., so I figure others will as well.</li>
    <li> Really like these razor blades they give a close smooth shave with no irritation. The razors work well for me in my Edwin Jagger De89lbl.</li>
    <li> I was sent these by mistake by an amazon seller. I am very glad he did. I have tried feather, merkur, sword, and shark blades. The astra is the way to go. I also recommend proraso tube shave cream. It does dry out your skin a bit so you should consider a good after shave</li>
    <li> how can u go wrong at 9 cents apiece</li>
    <li> Half way done through the box and every single blade is top quality recommend it  for everybody!!!!</li>
    <li> They are a good quaility blades. Would recommend to friends and family.Would diffently order more in future orders. Good close shaves.</li>
    <li> Are the sharpest, highest-quality safety razor blades in the world? No, but they are great for the price.  Aside from a straight razor, safety razors are the best choice for environmentally-friendly, low-cost shaving.  Very little waste, close shaves, no plastic--what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Best shave ever after getting some in a sample pack I decided to go &amp;#34;all in&amp;#34; for the big box.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  My standard go to is a Gillette Tech L3 &#x27;64 and though a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; shaver these blades are fantastic.  Job completed BBS and not a weaper in sight.  Cannot beat the pricepoint quality here, ladies and gents!</li>
    <li> When I first switched to using a DE razor, I bought a sample pack of blades to try and find what my ideal blade was.  I ended up with a couple that worked really well for me, but these were above and beyond what everyone else had.  Smooth shave, doesn&#x27;t require a lot of pressure and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the safety razor family, so I have yet to experiment with many blades. Out of the three I tried(Merker and Featherblade) these blades are the cheapest and best for me. You can&#x27;t go wrong with paying $11 for 5-6 years worth of blades.</li>
    <li> Great price per blade. Not as sharp as a feather blade but still good and gives a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Better than the Merkur I&#x27;ve used. Keeps its edge and smooth shave longer. I have a heavy coarse beard. I am on my third shave and just as smooth as the first shave.</li>
    <li> Great blades..... Trash all of your multi-blade new razors and go old school</li>
    <li> Russians are quite good at metallurgy. Yes, Germany and Japan are also great but Russians can make some amazing steel alloys and it is apparent in these Astra blades. I have tried many, including the heavily touted Feather from Japan and even KAI. These are not as consistent as Feathers and not nearly as aggressive as Feathers, but they do perform great. I use a mild razor with these to allow for occasional shape variations (very slight), then I go full throttle and shave clean in just two to three passes. Also, these are priced really low nowadays possibly due to economy over there. Anyways, this is a superior blade equal to the best out there in its own terms and in its own unique style.</li>
    <li> These blades are rediclously good. You will not find a better blade, and yes most double edge blades are dull.</li>
    <li> These razors are great! You don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;brace yourself&amp;#34; to use these razors. They give a really good shave without being dangerous sharp. They last me about 5 shaves before having o be replaced.</li>
    <li> Not a bad blade. Not the best I&#x27;ve used but a good shave can be had from these blades. Not much more I can say about these, really. They were the first large blade purchase I made since getting into wet shaving. I&#x27;ve always floated between many brands but decided to give these a longer period of time to work with. Not too shabby. I&#x27;ve since moved onto another manufacturer but will come back to the Astra SP&#x27;s from time to time. Have even given some of the 5-blade packs to friends getting into wet shaving and they&#x27;re happy with the blades. Though, I&#x27;m not sure if they made their own purchase of these blades since then or have moved on to another blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and packaging was very good.</li>
    <li> When I was 16 I loved to shave:  I was a man.&lt;br /&gt;When I was 61 I loved to shave:  I shaved with my grandson.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m 16 plus 61 and I love to shave:  Astra!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoothie</li>
    <li> When I dove into shaving with a safety razor, I bought a variety pack of razors to try. These were heads and shoulders above the rest. Beautifully smooth shave with minimal effort. So I bought this box of 100. Each one lasts through more shaves than any other blade I&#x27;ve tried and still cut fantastically to the very end.</li>
    <li> I just picked my Astras up about a month ago and i&#x27;ve been amazed at what they can do. After having an &amp;#34;incident&amp;#34; with the feathers, pretty much cut half my face off, i went to my next set of blades I ordered and that was the Astras. Wow, i&#x27;m super impressed. This will be my go to set from here on out. I&#x27;m actually so impressed that I ilike them better than all the blades I tested in the sampler pack. As has been said many times once you find the blade for you, that&#x27;s it, you&#x27;ll stick with that one. I can say that about the Astras. Supreme.</li>
    <li> Gives a close smooth shave.  I&#x27;m.... &#x27;A FAN&#x27;. &#x27; Tough to come up with any more compliments about a razor blade.</li>
    <li> Great value. This item provides a smooth shave at a budget-friendly price. I can highly recommend this. Order yours today!</li>
    <li> These are really good blades.  I’m using a 2 path on each shave, and find the blades die after 2 full shaves.  I feel like they could be a bit sharper for me, but I will continue to use these blades :)</li>
    <li> UPDATE 05/15/2015: I tried these in Merkur 37c SLANT BAR razor - wow, great! It mowed down a week&#x27;s worth of beard in one pass without clogging and I only used subsequent passes to get that smooth feeling in all directions. I&#x27;ve never been able to do this before - longer growth always took extra passes.  UPDATE 06/10/2015: I just got a Merkur 15c &amp;#34;open comb&amp;#34; razor and the Astra SP blade also worked great in it. It is neither harsh nor too mild - seems just the right balance of sharpness and smoothness, it slices, no tugging.  IMHO these are a great value.  Only straight edge would be cheaper (but that takes more time/effort and more up-front investment).  I am new-ish to DE shaving, but also got into straight edge shaving a couple of years ago. I can only compare these to the German blades that came with my Van Der Hagen razor and maybe I&#x27;m not sophisticated enough yet, but they both appear to shave great - better than the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; cartridge razor i.e. Gillette Fusion ProGlide.  I like the value, but the packaging could be a bit more travel-friendly, but perhaps that would increase costs. Still, the little 5-blade boxes are great.  I am curious to try other blades and sharpnesses, but I don&#x27;t feel like I need to.  UPDATE 05/26/2015 - I have since tried a Wilkinson Sword and a sample Merkur blade (by Solingen) that came with my Slant. I have to say that my perception is that Astra is better - both: a closer shave and a milder shave with less irritation/injury. So far, out of the 4 I&#x27;ve tried - Van Der Hagen (Germany), Wilkinson Sword, Merkur and Astra - Astra seems best and Merkur seems worst (wow, really, Solingen?). I&#x27;ll keep updating as I have Feathers coming in soon :)  UPDATE - 06/03/2015. I also just tried a Feather blade with my Slant. The first shave was great and very smooth, the second - not so much. I am thinking that the Feathers are a one-shave blade. I still think Astras are the best blade AND cheapest blade out there.</li>
    <li> Tried several other brands, and found Astra to provide the best balance between a smooth shave and gentle blade. Tried other blades which usually give one or the other, either close shave but very harsh feel and lots of razor cuts, or gentle but poor shave. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Sharp, but I only get about 3-4 quality shaves out of them before they dull.  To be fair, I have a ridiculously thick beard, but regardless, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  Can&#x27;t beat that old-school shave!</li>
    <li> I would rate these a good beginner blades. I had a better experience with these over Derby&#x27;s. The Derby&#x27;s weren&#x27;t as sharp and would give me razor burn while these didn&#x27;t. That said, I am not buying them again as I prefer something sharper. For the price, they are really good.</li>
    <li> Blades for two years? For less than $15? Nice shave? Done deal</li>
    <li> Super sharp at a super sweet price.  Much sharper than the derby and other competitors.  I&#x27;ve been able to squeeze out several more shaves without replacing the blade yet.  Holds up well.</li>
    <li> These are nice sharp blades. Each one will last three to four shaves if you clean and dry&lt;br /&gt;after each use. Five times better than any brand they have down at Walmart.</li>
    <li> No matter what blade you use, I&#x27;d recommend having a sleeve of these around.  My girlfriend uses them to shave her legs.</li>
    <li> These have been so far the BEST blade I&#x27;ve used, but to be completely fair, I think you have to keep similar classes together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My DE razor (a gift, so I don&#x27;t know the exact make and model, but it looks like a Parker) came with Platinum coated Feather blades&lt;br /&gt;which she picked because she felt Japanese blades would be of a higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When those ran out I looked for different brands, and I really wanted a good quantity cheap... in the same bracket I saw the Astra Platinum, The Astra Super Stainless and the Shark Super Stainless.  I did not opt to try out the Astra Super Stainless and did not see the Shark in a Platinum coat at the time, so I picked up a box of Astra (Russian) VS and Box of Sharks (Egyptian)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;same pre-shave routine, same lotion, same amount of stubble, one week apart and these I feel are *better* than the Feather for an all-round shave.  Definitely sharper than the other two and less damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might experiment a little more, but I think this is what I&#x27;ll order form now on!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy. They are very sharp and individually wrapped. First in little boxes of 5 then each is wrapped in wax paper. Great blades.</li>
    <li> These are my first double edge razor I have purchased. They do what they need to do for me. I guess my only complaint would be after 3 shaves they seem to dull.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m taking a break from my regular blades, which are Feathers. It&#x27;s very subjective, but I really like these Astra blades. I can now shave without fear of cutting up my face. Feather gives me a close shave but I have to be very careful to avoid the bloodletting. I can get just as close a shave with Astra but it does involve more work, specifically more passes.</li>
    <li> Great value. With so many These should last till I retire LOL</li>
    <li> LOVE this!  individually wrapped.  Fits standard razor holders.  Much more economical than buying 5 razors at a time from local store for $ 1.00.  I plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> Try these if you want but I can&#x27;t get as good a shave with less irritation when compared to the feather blades.</li>
    <li> I ignored some of the reviews and regret it. The razors are terrible. If you want consistency, these will consistently rip your face apart.</li>
    <li> Been DE shaving for a few years now. Instead of buying a sample pack, opted to go cheap and buy one brand at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, I&#x27;ve tried Derby&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve tried these. The Astra &amp;#34;Superior Premium Platinums&amp;#34; are certainly superior (at least for MY face). Less irritation, smoother shave, and seem to last a bit longer than the Derby&#x27;s. I use one blade per 2-3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I&#x27;ll still be trying another brand when my current supply is exhausted.</li>
    <li> I gave these blades 5 stars because they are the best I&#x27;ve tried.  Better than Feather, Shark and Gillette.  Smoother, sharper and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve given up on DE shaving after a month.&lt;br /&gt;I started when I found my and my dad&#x27;s old safety razors.  Being irritated at the high cost of disposables, I wanted to give this a go.&lt;br /&gt;I soon remembered why no one is using DE razors any more.  They are just too rough on the face.  I was back to the old nicks and cuts I had when I first started shaving as a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;DE also requires a high degree of skill as the technique changes as the blade goes from sharp to dull.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, 5 bladed razors are a bit ridiculous and the old single bladed bics were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve found that a good twin blade is a quantum leap beyond the DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;And for an extra $5 / year for me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> It seems like 3/4 through a shave then begin to dull. If you have very little facial hair it is no problem.</li>
    <li> I live in Chicago and am an owner of a double blade razor. I was having difficulty finding these blades until now so many at such a great price awesome just awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought an &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; twist-to-open Feather Double Edged razor because I hoped that I would experience greater shaving comfort and a closer shave. My beard hair is not dense and heavy, but it is wiry, curly and hard to mow. I had also allowed myself to wishfully believe some current TV propaganda about how once popular double-edged blades really provided a better shave than contemporary Gillette or Schick or Wilkinson Sword multlple-blade razors and their costly cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor I bought came with five Japanese made Feather brand blades. At the same time I bought this 100-pack of Astra Platinum Blades made in St. Petersburg, Russia--the old Leningrad of the defunct Soviet Union. They came nicely packaged in sets of five individually wrapped blades. The Amazon reviews were almost uniformly positive and rated these blades highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put aside the Wilkinson Sword Quattro (same as Schick) razor I&#x27;d been using since I bought it three years ago in Italy. It not only had four blades, but a fifth blade single blade specifically for edging in hard to reach areas such as right under your nose. With some lovely and refreshing Italian shaving soap brushed on in a thick lather applied by a fine bristle brush I figured I was all set and started in on my first luxury shave done the way Daddy did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Feather blades that came with my razor I cut myself in three places. I persisted until all five Feather blades where gone. With only one exception I cut myself in two or three places each time I shaved. I did exactly the same thing with these Astra Blades. I finally used about 15 of the Astra blades (and maybe a whole jiggerful of blood) before I was done once again, and likely now forever, with double-edged shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have returned to my Quattro razor that has more blades than a reel-type lawnmower. It&#x27;s still cuts me once in awhile, but once in awhile is a lot better than every day and every time I shave. The Quattro also gives me a closer shave, maybe because I don&#x27;t start to tremble as I did when that double-edged slicer neared my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, blade replacements will cost me a lot more. I have decided to just put up with it. I may even save a buck or two on styptic pencils.ttro also gives me a closer shave, maybe because I don&#x27;t start to tremble as I did when that double-edged slicer neared my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, blade replacements will cost me a lot more. I have decided to just put up with it. I may even save a buck or two on styptic pencils.</li>
    <li> Super Fast delivery and one day earlier then they said it would arrive. First blade out of the pack  I tried seemed to be very dull! I got razor burn like you would not believe from shaving passing over 6 or 8 times to get the job done. But then I Tried two more blades and it was a different story, super sharp getting the job done right the first time. With no razor burn for me. So once I try out a couple more razors and make sure the dull razor I had was just bad luck I will raise the four stars to five !!</li>
    <li> bought a pack of 1000 blades 3 years ago&lt;br /&gt;And worked fine that&#x27;s why I stuck with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Now I reordered a new pack of 1000 blades again and these seem to be sharper than the older once,  and last a few more shaves before I have to replace.</li>
    <li> I bought these as starter blades for switching back to traditional safety razors. Nothing great to report and nothing negative to report. Made in Russia.</li>
    <li> It seems that this type of blades are edged on one side, not both side.  If you place the blade in the DE razor with the number &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; facing outward, that blade cuts like crap, but if the blade is placed with &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; facing outward it cuts very well. Not the best blades but still worthwhile to use.</li>
    <li> Lol wow let&#x27;s see that&#x27;s an 80+ positive rating yeah im sold im definitely buying these blades the 21 nimrods must be on Crack</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bad blades and good blades.  These are good blades.  They are also a steal for how many you are getting.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is okay, not too sharp. I need to run it few more times than I used to with feather. Still can get close shave, but need more works.</li>
    <li> Great blades, very reliable and at a great price</li>
    <li> Good blade, cuts well.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades to try out because I was looking for an affordable good double edge blade - so I gave these a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are by far the best blades I&#x27;ve used in my entire time shaving with double edged razors (15 years)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are ultra-thin and hold an edge like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate these up there with any of the high end DE blade brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definitely recommend to any and all!</li>
    <li> Disappointed that I can only get 1 decent shave per blade. I have a very light facial hair. I rinsed the blade after the first shave but it didn&#x27;t perform as well. However, at .10cent per blade it beats Mach3&#x27;s at $2.50 per blade. I may change brands but I will never go back.</li>
    <li> Blades are plentiful and sharp. I usually use one razor every two shaves. Sometimes I will go three shaves depending.There are so many razors that I&#x27;m not worried about going through them too fast and they work like a charm.</li>
    <li> Wonderful close shave.</li>
    <li> Japanese blades are too sharp The last thing I want on a hurried morning is a cut face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The German blades are far too costly and only provide only 1 extra shave for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Russians have a winner here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(just hope the steel isn&#x27;t from Chernobyl!)</li>
    <li> There are better blades out there if you are seeking a sleek and smooth finish. However, for the price and the daily grind these preform very well at getting the job done. Not as sharp as a Feather or Shark but it&#x27;s not like shaving with a butter knife either. Cost aside I would still take these over an iTunes enabled, 20 blade cartridge that will do the dishes for you when your done, hands down.</li>
    <li> Great experience with these. I started off with Derbys and then gave these a try. Inexpensive and very sharp. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with bleeding or nicking that I did with the Derbys. Wish it came with a razor disposal box though.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: everyone&#x27;s skin is different&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, after trying many blades from Derby to BIC to Feather, these were by far the best combination of smoothness, price, and sharpness</li>
    <li> going back to Derby brand.</li>
    <li> My son swears by these. He has had no nicks or cuts using them and they are very durable. Better quality than from the beauty supply.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend for shaving, or battle with neighbors. Will definitely be purchasing again. I shave my head and face with these bad boys.</li>
    <li> Astras happen to work well for me, as well as many other men, and the offered price was excellent. As the saying goes, &#x27;your mileage may vary&amp;#34; or YMMV.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I use it for different purposes in my home.</li>
    <li> Love the blades. They shave perfectly. I really like the 5 pack style for convenience and travel. Great value and performance!</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on these. They&#x27;re not stiff, super flexible and definitely better than blade sample that came with the Edwin Jagger razor, but I have a super tough beard and tender skin. I may not be shaving exactly right, but I&#x27;ll know more after I try one of those blades the reviews warn being so sharp newbies shouldn&#x27;t try them. I&#x27;m not nicking myself with these and since my beard is so tough I&#x27;m hoping the sharper ones will be the ticket. I remember reading on reviews that blades vary widely and ya gotta keep trying them until you find the right blade. I almost tried an assortment pack but they didn&#x27;t include a couple blades on my try list. These are fine though &amp; cheap enough even if you don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
    <li> These blades provide a very smooth and comfortable close shave when I use them with my Feather Popular razor. I prefer them to the Feather blades the razor came with since those blades aren&#x27;t as comfortable and left some very shallow nicks.</li>
    <li> These blades will make you forget about the over-priced &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; razors now on the market. Use them in a Edwin Jagger razor with a good Italian shave cream such as Proraso or Omega applied with a quality badger brush and you&#x27;ll never go back. wonderful!</li>
    <li> the product came the day they said it would. the product itself was well packaged and easy to get out. the blades themselves are very sharp and I got a very nice shave from them. I will continue to use this brand.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a few weeks now.  I&#x27;ve only used Derby blades, so those are the only ones I can compare to, but after the first shave with these Astra blades I immediately felt a closer and smother shave.  These blades seem a bit sharper than Derbys because I notice less tugging/pulling at the hair and the shave is a bit closer.  I use these with a Merkur razor and Proraso Sensitive Shave Soap and I seriously LOVE shaving now.  For the price these blades give me a great and comfortable shave and I see no reason to spend more for some of the more expensive blades, at least for the time being.  I would definitely recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> I had been in the process of trying various blades, ones available at my local stores and some various things online.  I first got the Astra Superior Premium Platinums in a variety pack of blades and for some reason they just stuck out as a great blade to me.  I have a very coarse, thick beard and shave daily, so I tend to swap the blades out every two or three days, with these I can usually get 4 good days out of them (lather, shave with grain, lather, shave against grain) before I notice a difference in how smooth the cut is.  I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with these until I find something better (if and when that happens), but you really can&#x27;t beat the deal on the cost!</li>
    <li> These razors work great with Merker safety razors.  Nice and smooth, good wrapping, cheap!  I would buy these again for sure</li>
    <li> It took me a lot of trying different blades to realize that the first blade i ever tried was the best one I have ever tried. I have read a lot of different reviews on blades, and most say that everyone has a different face, different kinds of skin and sensitivity, and types of facial hair, and this is why each person has to try some blades and see what works for them. I have sensitive skin and am very prone to razor burn and breakouts after shaving, and i have a moderate thickness of beard growth. The feather, derby, and shark blades were not sharp or stiff enough to make a clean cut without me having a destroyed face at the end of it. The green cased Gillette blade was a fine blade, just not as nice of a result as the Astra blade. The blue Gillette blade was so sharp that when shaving my neck, without even noticing, i had completely sliced through a mole on the back of my neck. I didn&#x27;t even feel the cut or notice until i felt the blood running down my back. So like i said, every person is different and has different preferences, but what i have noticed is that Astra is the best one for me. I do not need to focus so much on my technique as this blade does a great job on its own. I never have any cuts or razor burn or anything when i use Astra. I feel a very smooth and even perfectly close shave with little effort or focus on my technique. one blade if cleaned off after each use and stored dry will last me up to 6-7 shaves, but since they are so inexpensive, i have no problem getting out a new one after only 4 shaves. i dont feel a need to risk using a dull blade when they are only a few pennies each.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of buying Russian made blades, but after reading the reviews, I thought Id give it shot. I was pretty happy with them .I have a tougher beard type and not so sensitive skin. I&#x27;m not a razor snob, if it works, it works. Id buy them again and I&#x27;d recommend them to friends .</li>
    <li> Sharp great  blades i use for touch up after electric shaver, i seldom use for full shave,  but when i do it cuts clean with fresh blade, i dont usually use for more than two shaves 3rd shave is noticeably duller then again there are 100 count its been 5 months since purchase 1/5th of the way down with the box&lt;br /&gt;would not buy again due to switching over to electric shaver</li>
    <li> Super sharp blades at a very affordable price. Astra blades are made by Gillette in their Russian factory. These are superior blades that you will love in your smooth shaving double edge razor. Spend $3.00 per blade with your ultra modern whiz bang gadget, but these blades in a Merkur will beat it everytime.</li>
    <li> When I first bought my double edged safety razor handle, I got two free Feather Hi-Stainless blades with it. They worked just as well, if not better, than a brand new Gilette Mach 3 cartridge. So, once I had gone through my two Hi-Stainless blades, I turned to Amazon to find some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I stumbled upon a box of 20 cartons of 5 blades (100 blades) of Astra DE Blades. I figured, for $10, why not? So I pulled the trigger, and shortly afterwards they arrived in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, if you&#x27;re looking for a blade that -works-, these work. They shave, and they shave pretty decently, but for someone who has thick facial hair and lets it grow about 5-7 days between shaves, these blades only last about 2-3 weeks before they need to be changed. Which is fine, because they are so darn cheap that you can afford to do that! However, having had experience with Feather Hi-Stainless, which could tolerate that amount of facial hair growth and still last about 4 weeks, I can&#x27;t recommend Astra DE Blades over Feather Hi-Stainless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather Hi-Stainless are some of the best DE blades you can buy, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the large amount of razors for the cost. However, they do not come with a case to dispose of them in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE blades but so far I am very happy with this blade.  It provides a close shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> I purchased these 100 pk. of astra superior premium platinum blades and are very happy with them. And the price cannot be bear.</li>
    <li> Simply cheap, Inferior blades. Do not shave well. Go for better quality.  Merkur or other Safety razor blades are far superior.</li>
    <li> 4-6 shaves per blade. incredibly smooth, excellent cutting ability even with 3-4 days of growth. nothing currently on the market comes even close to double edge shaving. forget the enormous savings, look forward to shaving again. 4 shaves &#x3D; 1 penny. the single edge blades cost approximately $1.00/shave. cut shaving costs by 99%.</li>
    <li> I bought three boxes for the 3 men in my life (husband and two sons).  My oldest son was the last hold-out and still used disposable razors with a shaving soap and brush.  He&#x27;s hooked!  He shaves his head and has a medium beard.  It took him one shave to get the angle down right and he loves it!  We are saving a ton of money (his wife thanks me).  Yes, this is about a year&#x27;s supply, so I hope I can get them for Christmas next year!</li>
    <li> The sharpest blade that i have ever come in contact with. Ultra thin for my straight edge and tested the edge on a piece of laminated paper, now i have two papers. One razor will give you an easy and close 3 shaves, if not 5.</li>
    <li> Very affordable and great product gives very clean and close shaving would def recommend to another person to use everyday .</li>
    <li> i have a thick beard and these do ok. id prefer to spend a little extera and get the feathers but these are good.</li>
    <li> Pretty new to DE shaving, and had started off with an Edwin Jagger DE89 and Merkur blades. The Merkurs were OK, then I tried Derby. The Derbys were horrible and cut me up. Decided to give the Astras a shot, and they are by far my favorite out of the three. BBS shave on the first try with them and zero cuts or irritation. Fine blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m primarily writing this review in comparison to the Feather Platinum blades that I&#x27;ve used quite a bit. I bought this 100 pack of blades because they had good reviews and were cheap! Definitely noticed a huge difference compared to the feather blades. The Astra blades seem very dull and require much more pressure along the skin to get any reasonable shave. Oddly, it seems like some of the blades are significantly sharper than others. Sometimes, I would use them and think that it wasn&#x27;t so bad, but other times, I would open a new blade and felt the need to immediately throw it out. I would definitely not buy these blades again. I&#x27;ve given them a fair chance -- used like 40 of them, but I just don&#x27;t think my skin can take any more.</li>
    <li> Like always the package came in a very timely matter. That is what I love about Amazon. Since I haven&#x27;t been able to find double edge blades in any local store it was nice to be able to order it and get it in two days. The product is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I converted to a DE safety razor at Christmas and got a sample pack of 7 or 8 different brands.  Some brands were too sharp, some pulled on the hair too much, and a couple were just right.  The Astra was &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.  I found the quality to be high, the blades were of consistent sharpness, and at this price and swapping them out once a week lasts me 2 years for far less than disposable or even replacement blades for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course there are a lot of different types of hair out there, so I suggest starting with a sample pack to see what works for you.  And even if you do buy the pack of 100, and it doesn&#x27;t work out, then you really aren&#x27;t out a whole lot anyway.</li>
    <li> These work great in my merkur razor.  My beard is very course and I have a lot of trouble with ingrown hairs.  Wet shaving sure helps.  I also  HATE HATE HATE spending hundreds of dollars a year on mark 37 fusion core or whatever I was using before.  My beard being very coarse, I use one blade a day for maximum comfort.  I could probably get a few shaves out of one, but for ten cents each, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I bought this and I haven&#x27;t needed razors for roughly a year. I still have half the box!&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how they&#x27;re making money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different double edged blades, and (so far), I think Astra has been my best experience. Half way down the package and I haven&#x27;t run into a dull blade yet.</li>
    <li> I use these twice then replace. Costs me a nickel a shave (~$10/100 BLADES). I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard but these blades work well for me.</li>
    <li> Just got into wet shaving and Astra works great for me.  Obviously no comparison in price vs. &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors and give a much cleaner shave as well.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to find a good set of razor blades that I liked. These blades are very sharp and I haven&#x27;t had any issues while shaving. The blades are able to slice through my facial hair like I was using a Hattori Hanzō sword and I end up with a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Happy, happy, happy! Just what i needed for my ancient Trim Comb. Just couldn&#x27;t find double edge blades locally anymore.</li>
    <li> Blades are _way_ sharper than the Shark blades I bought previously. Highly recommend. I can get 1-2 uses per side out of these and they&#x27;re still sharper than a fresh Shark blade</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know what got into me that I wanted to try using these type of blades to shave.  it turned out to be too much work; would have to work hard and long on prepping my beard (and it&#x27;s not coarse) or I&#x27;d look like I&#x27;m into cutting myself (awful).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of different popular DE blades from Feathers to the awfully dull Derbys. Feathers were the sharpest but the least forgiving. These, for me are right at the sweet spot.</li>
    <li> For me and my face, this razor works wonders, it simply works for me. It is aggressive but forgiving. Very nice and the price is absolutely amazing!!!!!!AAAAAAA</li>
    <li> Solid product, will buy again when I run out but it will be a while.</li>
    <li> With the amount of shaving I do, this is enough to last me over a year for the cost of one refill of your standard 5-blade cartridge refills. I love using my double edge safety razor and these are my go-to blades of choice.</li>
    <li> These blades arrived on-time and packaged great. The build is better and I&#x27;ve noticed less irritation than my usual blades. I will be switching to these instead. Pricewise, this is one of the best deals for the quality that I&#x27;ve seen from multiple brands/stores.</li>
    <li> Incredibly inexpensive to use these with a traditional style razor instead of replacing Fusion blades.  So far these are working perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> These are pretty high quality blades. The sharpness lasts for around 4 or 5 shaves and they don&#x27;t rust in between. You can&#x27;t beat the cheap cost compared to razor cartridges.</li>
    <li> Bought them for a present for my boyfriend to go along with an old fashioned shave kit I bought him.  He seems to like them, says they shave very well.</li>
    <li> They are awesome.  Just make sure you keep them in a veerrrrry dry place, as this many blades lasts two years for me, and coming up on 1.5 years, some of the blades have inconsistent sharpness on them.  Hoping that&#x27;s just from a year of moisture.</li>
    <li> good set of blades for nice cut. I change after two shaves.</li>
    <li> I know many people will praise the Feather blades but I find Feather blades to be surgically sharp. Too sharp to give a comfortably smooth shave. The Astras actually give me a better shave at a cheaper cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Feather blades, I feel like they doubled down on the cutting edge at the expense of the quality of the shave. By that, I mean that, yes, Feathers are the sharpest blade you can buy but it not only cuts me more but seems to give an inferior shave because it&#x27;s so harsh on those troublesome areas like the Adam&#x27;s Apple and just under the chin. I simply can&#x27;t get a complete shave in these areas that Astras can.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be on the Feather bandwagon but after trying a sample pack that included Astras I can&#x27;t go back to Feathers. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. Feathers are amazing for shaving a flat surface but fall short on facial and body contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have against Astras isn&#x27;t really something that bothers me but this is a review so I must be critical. The Astras are wrapped with wax dots that hold the paper wrapping around them. After some use of Astra blades you&#x27;ll notice that the wax builds up in the safety razor and you&#x27;ll periodically have to clean it. It&#x27;s not a big deal since safety razors are stainless steel but it&#x27;s something I know some people gripe about. When I consider the superior shave and rear price I&#x27;m receiving, a little wax isn&#x27;t anything to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about these blades is they ship from within the US. Feathers are Japanese and ship from Singapore. You will wait quite a long time as anyone that has ordered anything from Hong Kong can attest to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of using any product that is made in the former Soviet Union but I&#x27;ve quickly realized that Astras are superior in giving a superior shave. They aren&#x27;t the sharpest blade but they don&#x27;t need to be. These blades excel in giving you the cutting edge you need without giving you those nicks and that itchy burning sensation you get from Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have personally used Silver Blues, Astra, 7 o&#x27;clock, Big Ben, Derby, Bic, Nacet, Feather Hi-stainless, Nacet Stainless, and Blue Bird.&lt;br /&gt;Not going to pretend these are the best for everyone but I would say they&#x27;re a great choice for most. Please don&#x27;t buy these standalone blades until you buy a sample pack. I bought a sample pack of 50 that had 10 different brands. It&#x27;s expensive but you&#x27;ll thank yourself ok the end when you find what works. Good luck everyone!!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a real man&#x27;s man who likes a clean shaven face, these razors are for you.  Your rugged man face will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried these blades - brand new - in both a Merkur 38Hd and an ATT R2 and experienced a lot of pulling with lots of stubble and uncut whiskers left behind, even when using a pre-shave cream. In both cases I changed the blade in the middle of my shave to a Wilkinson Sword blade which glided across my face, leaving me with a close, comfortable  shave. I have seen other people get a good shave with these blades. So maybe the quality control isn&#x27;t consistent resulting in occasional bad batches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that razor blades are not all created equal, but these work well for me.  I use each side once, then flip it over and repeat, so I get 4 shaves out of each razor.  At that rate, 1 box will last me over 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do see the wax on the blade, that other reviews have mentioned.  It does not seem to be a problem for me, so I think, no big deal.  At first, I was cleaning that off with hot, soapy water and a towel, but I do not think it is worth the effort.  The razors work fine for me.</li>
    <li> Great blades, probably the best buy on the market right now.</li>
    <li> So we all know that when using a safety razor your shave is only as good as the blade you use, I&#x27;ve tried all the blades out there and this blade is up there with the best..I shave with 3-4 passes daily as I have a very stubborn beard and grow hair like a gorilla on miracle grow and these blades hold up much longer than most. I definitely recommend them..give them a try!</li>
    <li> Fortunately, after trying many different blades out there to find the right combo of my face and razor this is the one for me. Blades are sharp but not too sharp (feather). I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never have to buy blades again in my lifetime unless I buy a new razor and these don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> astra blades are sharp. they also last me 3-4 shaves. these blades in junction with my merkur 34c is a dream.</li>
    <li> Great blades fantastic price. using a double edge razor is the way to go. Astra are the best blades I have used yet.</li>
    <li> These are nice and sharp but they don&#x27;t last very long for me. I can only use these blades for two shaves and then they are toast. Not bad for the price but, quality wise, they don&#x27;t seem to be on par with Merkur or Crystal. Everyone has a different face/beard though so I&#x27;m sure they work better for folks with less coarse facial hair.</li>
    <li> Sharp, holds an edge well.</li>
    <li> They seem great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I was shorted 20 blades, but Amazon resolved it for me.&lt;br /&gt;Unknown yet, how many shaves I can get from each one.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Not original Astra, packaging is different, quality too,not the astra i used to use</li>
    <li> Arrived so fast... Like 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;Great deal, I use them with my Merkur razor, and I am SO HAPPY that I NEVER HAVE TO BUY RAZORS AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a double edge razor since I tried to use disposables and realized they are a waste of money. Double edges are so much cheaper especially when you buy them in these quantities. These are the best bang for your buck. I did purchase a really good merkur razor(the handle) for about 90$ but it has lasted me over 20 years and has saved me a lot of money in the long run. Theses are nice and sharp.</li>
    <li> Such a great deal, great quality and great shave!&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Starter or longtime users agree, these work great!</li>
    <li> Very high quality razor blade, super price and holds it&#x27;s edge as good as any razor blade I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Sharp enough. Good blades for safe close shave. There is only steel and paper, no plastic boxes, environment safe. Great value / price product.</li>
    <li> These are my go to blades, I have used them in a Merkur HD, 1962 Gillette Tech, and a 1948-49 Gillette SS. These blades performed very well in all 3! They are the cheapest blades on the market, but also the best for me. They last up to a week for me, and I have a thick beard. Definitely recommend, I&#x27;m working on my doomsday stash right now, and these are a large part of it!</li>
    <li> After trying a half dozen brands, this is my favorite!  Everyone should try several blades before settling on a favorite blade.</li>
    <li> Really like these blades.  I get a nice smooth shave and at a really good price.  I rate these right behind my Feathers.</li>
    <li> Astras are a great compromise between Sharp and smooth. They also seem to last a bit longer than others I have tried. This is my go to blade.</li>
    <li> These were pretty good razors.  Some of them had some adhesive on them from the manufacturing process, nothing that couldn&#x27;t come off with a few scrapes of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed my blades about once a week when I used a DE.  They worked well and as expected. I would buy these again. I liked them more than the Shark blades and another competitor razor blades.</li>
    <li> good blades saves much money over buying disposable razors or buying razor heads. i had the old time razor so i was ahead big time.</li>
    <li> I wish I had returned these for a refund when I had the chance. Every single blade is coated with some kind of gooey, sticky adhesive from the packaging. This gunk will get all over your razor and it is very difficult to clean. Also, this sticky gunk on the blade will affect shaving performance! I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch, or if it&#x27;s standard manufacturing practice for Astra to ruin their blades with the packaging process, but either way, I will never purchase Astra blades ever again. Even at 10 cents a blade it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of reviews on this product so I don&#x27;t have much to add, but will say that DE blade preference is a highly personal topic.  Some blades work great for some &amp; terribly for others, so you have to try multiple types until you find one that works for you.  I find these Astra SP blades smooth and they give me a GREAT shave.  Plus they&#x27;re inexpensive.  Good luck finding a blade that works for you!</li>
    <li> I use this with my Edwin Jagger DE89 and it provides a very smooth shave. If you don&#x27;t already know how to shave with a safety razor, I suggest checking out /r/Wicked_Edge on reddit. What blade works best for you depends on you and your razor, so what works best for me might not work best for you. I&#x27;m very glad I switched over from using a Gillette Fusion ProGlide, you save money and get a cleaner shave after some practice. The blades are so cheap that I just switch it out for a new one every day, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to try safety razors after getting tired of how much I was paying for Gilette refills.  These razor blades combined with a good hot shaving soap work great.  They recommend starting out going with the grain instead of against it until you get used to using a safety razor and your skin adjusts to it as well, so the shaves don&#x27;t seem as close as they used to be, but there&#x27;s only one blade scraping my face at once so I don&#x27;t get nearly as much skin irritation as I used to either.</li>
    <li> For a dime a blade, these double edged safety blades are an incredible deal. They give a good, clean, close shave with my standard razor, and each blade easily last several weeks on my medium beard.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the somewhat questionable point of origin bother ya&#x27;. They work!</li>
    <li> I can get two full clean shaves per blade and could stretch it out to four if wanted but at this price theres no point not to use a new blade.</li>
    <li> I love these blades.  For me, they have the perfect balance of sharpness and smoothness.  A very forgiving blade, but you still have to shave carefully or you&#x27;ll slice your face up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always,  your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> A close, smooth shave for course beards and sensitive skin.  Reasonable cost for the amount of blades.  Would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I recently started wet shaving, and now that I am into it full-swing, I decided to buy a large pack of razors. These are great, well packaged, and provide a nice sharp, smooth shave without being too sharp like other blades.</li>
    <li> Just bought a safety razor and used this blade, first shave was great. Sharp blade, no complaints. Easy to install on a safety razor, great value for my dollar. I recommend</li>
    <li> My go to safety razor blade.  I have tried many, many different blades and these have come out on top.  Here are 3 reason why:&lt;br /&gt;1. I have very sensitive skin and these blades do not seem to irritate as much as others blades have.  There are a lot of factors that need to ne taken into consideration but the blades are very sharp even after 2-3 shaves they still feel like new.&lt;br /&gt;2. You quickly know when you need to replace the blade.  It is interesting but to me they seem to either be very sharp or you quickly know they need to be changed.  That is not to say they do not last a few shaves but it is an all or nothing blade.&lt;br /&gt;3. The blades are very inexpensive.  I always struggled to spend a lot on blades and have to throw them away.  I know this is the case for almost all safety blades but these especially.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy these blades and always share with other safety razor friends any chance I get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now used approximately 20-25 of these blades.  They work pretty amazing, I find they &amp;#34;peak&amp;#34; on the 2nd-3rd shave.  I typically get 5-6 shaves on a blade before changing.  They are packaged and wrapped very well.  These are an amazing value, and are the best blades I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about twelve or so double edge razor brands, inlcuding the stainless model Astra puts out. These have proven to be my favorite. I get a close comfortable shave with them and they last up to nine or ten shaves. They could last more but I figure they cost so little it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to wash my shaving equipment every nine or ten shaves.</li>
    <li> It took me a week or so to get used to it from switching from multi blade multi million dollar blade. Now, I get great shaves and the box will last me about a year.  I will only use it 2 or 3 shaves and replace it. Well worth the savings. I haven&#x27;t tried many other blades to compare it to.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and very smooth.  They give me 3 or 4 shaves on a fairly tough beard.  At the cost it remains much less expensive than modern cassette razors and shaves closer.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re an experienced DE razor user these blades are great for a medium beard.  They are so inexpensive compared to cartridge blades I afford myself the luxury of a new blade everyday.  Some of the reviews make me wonder about what people do with double edged blades. If you&#x27;re pressed for time and have 5 minutes to shave don&#x27;t even consider a DE.  Keep some cartridges for just that event.  However, if you can spend 15-20 minutes relaxed, shaving and caring for your skin then nothing beats a double edged razor.  You can shave with a Feather or a Dorco or any other blade.  Just don&#x27;t be in a hurry.  And shave everywhere twice.  Remarkable blade for the money.</li>
    <li> Cant beat the price of 100 blades. I swap out a blade a week to keep them fresh and sharp. They cut smooth as can be and stay sharp even after several shaves with longer stubble or beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these to anyone on a budget who wants a close shave.</li>
    <li> This are the best blades thus far i have used.  good price,  one blade last a week.  doesn&#x27;t cut my face off</li>
    <li> Practice Practice Practice! the more you shave, the easier it becomes, and the better your shave will be. even if you only shaved once each side this is still 200 shaves for only around 10 bucks! Now thats a deal! but only practice will let you shave clean and cut less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double edge razor since 1963!  These blades are the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever used. A very smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t pull my beard.  I&#x27;m very happy with them, and a great price too. Please keep selling them Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to safety razors but was growing tired of spending exorbitant amounts of money on &amp;#34;Mach 3&amp;#34; cartridge razors. The razors are sharp and packaged great for long term storage and use. I also purchased a shaving set and a Merkur Model 180 Safety Razor. Very happy with the razors and will buy them again (In about 3 years because you get so many!)</li>
    <li> Good price/quality, not too sharp.</li>
    <li> Common, these blades are awful. They&#x27;re smooth like the five star reviews states because they are DULL, NOT SHARP! Crap, I made a mistake purchasing such a large quantity.  Not sure if Amazon will refund since I only used one blade.</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave I have ever had with a double edged blade, used with a Merkur 34C. I have pretty course facial hair and I get about 3 shaves out of each blade before they start to get dull. I tried Shark blades before these and I cut myself all the time, I thought it was my technique, turns out it was just the blades!</li>
    <li> I tried these just to see if they would be right for me and planned to try others as well to compare. But after trying them for about a month I see no reason to look any further. I am very pleased. BTW I use these in a very old old Gillette DE razor from my grand paw</li>
    <li> Very good blade, first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand, and it&#x27;s a toss up, between Wilkinson(my favorite). They are both excellent for me. We know it&#x27;s a combo, that is 1. your faces&#x27; contour, 2. the razor, 3. the blade. These 3 factors, plus your shaving lubricant of choice, that make the shave. These as the Wilkinson&#x27;s, are the best combo for me. This blade shows it&#x27;s character, under running faucet water. After each shave, I hold the blade under medium, to full tilt warm running water to keep it clean, and ready for the next shave. This blade, stands up to the fast flowing water, without bending, or feeling like it&#x27;s going to be bent out of shape. I use a Jagger Gold plated octagonal handle DBE, and it&#x27;s my favorite, it works well with any brand, but these two brands are standouts.</li>
    <li> Always gives a close shave and at a beyond reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am new to safety razors and still trying blades. These work . What more can I say. Sure beats plastic throw-away shavers.</li>
    <li> These razors are so much better than the brands I was able to purchase at my local drugstore. A super smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
    <li> sharp,  but a little skew when installed.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I could find for razor blades anywhere.  They&#x27;re difficult to find in stores now, and being a small item buying and storing 100 is not inconvenient.  I highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I have tried Derby and another now forgotten brand and these blades just seem to last longer and give a better shave than either of the contenders.  As they last a while I&#x27;m not really sure that I am going to both trying other blades past this point.  100 blades looks like it will last about 3 years for me and by that point I don&#x27;t see much use in taking a risk on another product as these have been so clearly superior to everything else I have tried.  I can&#x27;t say that this is the best thing on the market, but I can say that they work well and they are really cheap so I really have no reason to go elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and sharp shave.  Use these in my ATT S2 razor, it gives the closest and irritation free shaves I have found yet.  The price is also right, and there is no fear of changing these out when there is the slightest hint of dulling.  Always a sharp shave, and a sharp look!</li>
    <li> Looking for an alternative to the fusion. This was not it!  Very disappointed.  Did not shave very close at all!,,</li>
    <li> Last well and are great all around. Super cheap compared to newer razors and a better shave in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Just right.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, but doesn&#x27;t snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick facial hair and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> These are super cheap, super sharp and they treat my skin really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I shaved with regular razors that cost $40 for 5 blades and had a lot of skin and ingrown hair issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then about 6 months ago I decided to switch to safety razors after I got a straight razor shave at my barber and noticed how good the shave was and my skin issues started to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a traveling man, I have to be careful to not put these in my carry on luggage because TSA freaks out (if they even find them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, the Astra&#x27;s are great. I use one blade per shave, but you can definitely get more than that, but since they&#x27;re so cheap, I just use a fresh blade every time.</li>
    <li> My favorite blade.  Everyone has a different preference when it comes to shaving blades.  This came paired with my Weber razor and I fell in love with the combo.  Best shave for me every time.</li>
    <li> I purchased these 2 years ago, and still haven&#x27;t used the entire package. Granted, I finally started using other razors too, but I still love these. They are really sharp (not Feather sharp), but when it comes to razor blades, everyone&#x27;s face handles different blades differently. Great deal. I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
    <li> I think these are my new favorite. Very cheap and have a very smooth cut. They aren&#x27;t as sharp as feather, but they are far cheaper. If you haven&#x27;t tried them before, I recommend giving them a shot, though different blades work differently for different people.</li>
    <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Cheap junk, by the end of a shave it&#x27;s already dragging. Don&#x27;t buy these unless you have peach fuzz for a beard boys.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of razor blades and these are my go-to.  They are sharp, consistent, and last me about a week of daily shaves, although I have a lighter beard.  Price is extremely reasonable when purchased in bulk.  With these I can shave for 1-2 years for the price of about 1-2 months of 5-blade razor cartridges.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I chose these as my first real grownup razor blades.  They give a great shave.  Sharp as all heck.  Be careful.  I think these are pretty slick and they definitely work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried a real safety razor, give it a shot.  The handles start at like $4, I spent $10 for a brass one, works great.</li>
    <li> Great deal,fast delivery! Thank you</li>
    <li> These blades are great!</li>
    <li> These seem to degrade faster than Merkel blades. I am going through this pack of 100 very fast. Good value (price per blade) but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> These blades seem to be of about average quality and sharpness. I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, but I have very coarse hair, and these blades give me an adequate shave. The blades last for two shaves and I can maybe get a quick touch-up before changing them. They seem to be a good value, because even if they did last longer I like the idea of not reusing them many times. However, if you need a sharper blade, perhaps try a different product.</li>
    <li> Stay sharp longer and get many shaves from one. I will buy these again. I gives these 5 stars for that</li>
    <li> I used to spend big bucks buying five blade cartridges from Gillette.  Buy this and take a week to learn to shave and you will never go back.  Learn to shave with a razor and you will save yourself at least one hundred bucks a year.</li>
    <li> I use these blades with the mens bronze razor I get a good close shave and the blades last seven or 8 days for me.</li>
    <li> I like these blades alot.  They seem to be sharp and smooth.  There are others out there that are probably sharper and smoother but harder to find at this price point!  I also like the Rapira Platinum Lux&#x27;s which at times can be found for less than these!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. I don&#x27;t have any other blades to compare these to, but they have performed well so far</li>
    <li> New to the world of DE shaving and a friend of mine recommended these blades.  Not just for the price point, which is incredible, but for the closeness of the shave and the durability of the razor edge.  He was not wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these along with the Feather blades (which came highly recommended by a great number of people) and in my opinion Astra is by far superior.  I can perform 3 passes (with the grain, across the grain, and against the grain) without turning my face into hamburger (ew.. i know).  Leaves my face very smooth.  No burning or neck irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now these are my blades of choice.  That may change with time, but Astra has definitely set the bar.  Any other blade will have to outperform all 3 passes AND have a cheaper price point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different blades, and I&#x27;ve found these to be pretty good. I don&#x27;t feel like they are anything super special, but I have nothing bad to say about them either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and these are the best for me. Some may argue that others are better, but I don&#x27;t think these can be beat in terms of quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Simply Great Blades. These and the Trigs are favorites. I definitely recommend these blades if you want a clean shave.</li>
    <li> I was using Wilkinson Sword Classic razors for the past 6 months and just switched to these. OMG what a big difference! The Astra blades don&#x27;t pull on my hair like the Wilkinson razors did and now get a much more comfortable shave using fewer passes. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re sharp and cheap enough to replace every other day. Not as sharp as Feathers but are still good quality.</li>
    <li> Works much better than anything I&#x27;ve found in the local drug stores. The Gillette razors just tear up my face, these are much smoother shave.</li>
    <li> I recently shifted from cartridge shaving to a safety razor and got these blades based on the reviews. They are well made and do the job well. The price really cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in 20 packs of five packaged in a larger box. Easy for travel and the wax paper wrap provides a good disposal vessel for the previous blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a relatively light beard and can get two nice close shaves from a blade.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Affordable and sharp.</li>
    <li> These blades are great, and a great value.  I recently settled on the razor that I really like and happened to get two of them (one was purchased in a lot), so before I got rid of one, I did a blind blade comparison using several blades, including these, feather, personna, multiple of the 7 o&#x27;clock blades, vokshod, polsilver SI, etc.  When I finished and looked at how I had ranked the blades, I was surprised to find that these were my favorite blades, even more than the more expensive blades.  They continue to work well for me.</li>
    <li> Wow Great  100 pack it a Winner</li>
    <li> When I started to shave in my teens, I had a Gillette Trac II. Then came the Super-Duper shavers that had 3 blades, then the Fabulous 4 bladed razor...you know the story. I got tired of spending $25 to $30 on a pack of 8 razor heads that did nothing more than lower the number of times you had to run the razor across your face. I run the razor across my face until the whiskers are gone, whether it&#x27;s one, three, or five times. I figured I would try the double-edged safety razor with the butterfly opening that my dad used to shave with. It works, and each blades lasts for about 3-4 days of shaving.  A penny saved is a penny earned.</li>
    <li> My friend just gave me a box of 5 to try out, these blades are sooooooooooo sharp no drag at all. no irritation. these are now my go to blades. with the Dorco blades I have been unable to get a really close shave on my upper lip or around my mouth and chin. These Astra blades just slide so smoothly across your face, feels like a Lazer not a razor blade. Ive only shaved once with the blade so far so i cant comment on longevity of a blade right now.....but with a shave this close at this price with no discomfort? Worth it.</li>
    <li> I preface my review with the disclaimer that blades are an entirely personal preference.  What works for me may not work for you.  With that said, these are the best blades I&#x27;ve encountered.  They are extremely sharp and durable.  I find myself making fewer passes when I use these blades because they are performing so well.  Before committing to any particular brand of blades I suggest purchasing a sampler pack.  If you come to the same conclusion as I did then these are a solid buy.</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks so I could give an honest review of this product. Overall I am quite pleased with the blade sharpness is great for price. I can get 3 or 4 shaves with one blade with little or no irritation. It gives a slightly closer shave than the derby blades, and I like it comes in the 5 pack easy to travel with them.</li>
    <li> Sharp, and dependable.</li>
    <li> If you know anything about blades you know that everyone needs to search for the best blade for their face and razor combination.  These astra SP work great for me in a Edwin Jagger DE89.</li>
    <li> These have become my favorite blade in my safety razor. I have loads of shark blades, as good as those are I feel these give a close and more comfortable shave with less razor burn. These will be my go to blades in the future without a doubt. I will use the sharks in my straight razor.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite DE blade.  The price was outstanding and I look forward to purchasing the next batch.</li>
    <li> These blades are brilliant, but not many people have heard of it.  I picked up a sample pack of razors when I got my safety razor.  The Merkur and this one were my preferred, and seeing that these were running less than 10 cents a blade, I opted for these.  Blades are sharp enough to give clean shave and last for around 5-7 shaves.  Every so often you&#x27;ll get one that isn&#x27;t quite up to snuff, but at less than 10 cents a blade you can afford to lose a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 100 blades in this pack, I&#x27;m pretty set on blades well into the next year.  Be sure to try and make sure this blade will work well with you first though.  The $12-15 you shell out for a sample pack will be worth it in the long run to finding which blade you prefer.  That said, I think this blade will work quite well with most people.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;d categorize myself in the sensitive skin for shaving.  Although I found the Astra razor blades to not be sharp as I wanted.  You&#x27;re not going to get the deep, clean shave if you buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself going over my face with the razor blade more times than I&#x27;d like because it wouldn&#x27;t shave the little hairs that&#x27;s left.  It kinda defeats the purpose of a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be looking elsewhere for safety razor blades.</li>
    <li> Great blades at an affordable price. I am very happy with these blades. Purchased them as the included shark blades ran out. These seem better to me than the shark blades and I will never run out.</li>
    <li> Great Blades! Ill never buy plastic razors or multiple blade razors again.  For about 5 bucks less than a 4/5 blade razor, you can get enough razor blades to last  year or two AND have a closer shave. no brainer.</li>
    <li> Thinner blades. They feel cheaper and dull quicker than others I have used. Not a bad blade, I mean, it does work, but more like, I prefer the cut and after feel of different blades.</li>
    <li> As has been so common with these reviews, I&#x27;m coming from the expensive world of cartridge razors. I noticed that the newer generation not only gave me razor burn, didn&#x27;t give me a close shave, were a pain to keep clean but was lucky to get two shaves out of a cartridge. I was totally fed up with mediocre shaves that cost a fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking for alternatives and found that a lot of men are converting to old school double edged safety razors for shaving. The more I looked the more men were raving about how great their shaves are and how much they&#x27;re saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a starter Boss set that includes the razor, badger brush and a stand. I needed blades and stumbled across the Astra Platinum blades. I read all the reviews and looked at the price. It was a no brainer choice. 100 blades for between $10-$12? That&#x27;s insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are very sharp and give an excellent shave. I don&#x27;t shave daily so when I shave it&#x27;s thicker. The blades glide right through without razor rash. if you shave properly and let the razor do all the work, these blades make quick work of a rough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get 3 shaves out of a blade. You may get less or more but for me I tried to go to a 4th and didn&#x27;t like the result. I&#x27;m getting 50% more shaves out of the DE safety system than I was with a cartridge anyway. Plus at around $0.10-$0.12 a blade It way cheaper than the multi blade junk out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With as good as these blades are, how well they&#x27;re priced, you can afford to get a better razor and brush because it will literally pay for itself sooner than later. I plan on getting a better brush and razor soon. Yet I&#x27;ll continue to use the Astra blades. They&#x27;re giving me the best shaves i&#x27;ve ever gotten. I don&#x27;t plan on changing that. ***** stars</li>
    <li> Blades are not all the same for all faces but these are everything the manufacturer says they are.  Sharp, smooth and good price at $12 /100.</li>
    <li> We have been doing safety razors for decades. These are pretty good. They get the job done well. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between these razors and all the other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> These were the first blades that I found were OK when I started to DE.  Everyone has different blades that work for them and these were good, but after practicing for a couple of months, I found something that works better.  Buy a sampler pack to discover what blades work best for you.</li>
    <li> I used this blade for the first time and my experience was exactly the same like a review I read down below! I only got 2 shaves out of this blade and the 3rd shave chewed up my face with cuts and razor burn! These blades definitely don&#x27;t agree with me and I will not use these anymore! But with DE blades, what doesn&#x27;t work for me might work for you so! Just got to trial and error with blades and see what works for you!</li>
    <li> Good sharp blades.  Better than Derby, not as good as Feather.  These do the job just fine.  Not sure what else to say.</li>
    <li> Currently these are my favorite blades. As with anything shaving related you really have to try a lot of different products to find what works with your skin and shaving set-up. These blades seem to work very well for me and are remarkably cheap. I have fairly sensitive skin and my facial hair is course but not &#x27;full&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I get about 6 to eight shaves a blade thats 3 or 4 to the side and they don&#x27;t get rust spots on them, but you have to be a safety razor guy to ubderstand what that means, but i like them.</li>
    <li> Best blades I have found. Leave the skin very smooth and bump free. I pair them with Col Conk bay rum soap for shaving</li>
    <li> I can get one, maybe two shaves per blade. That is good for the price of these blades when compared to the Gillette sensor Update: had to relearn to shave. Now getting around 7 to 10 shaves. Good find!!!</li>
    <li> After trying dozens of different blade brands, The Astra Superior Platinums along with the Feather Hi Stainless are my go-to blades. I have no need to try anything else. The Astras give a smooth comfortable shave every time. A blade lasts about a week for me and I am doing a four pass shave. Great product.</li>
    <li> Let me start this off that I cannot grow a beard. I have used these for about two weeks and even with a fresh razor I need to pass over an area multiple times to get the area to shave. It will cleanly shave an area after multiple passes and with less tugging than my old desposibles, I ordered the Merkur Model 180 and it came with a blade that was impressive and much better that what I got with these. Sometimes saving money is good, but sometimes you need to spend for the quality.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite blades for my DE shaving kit, although they are not forgiving they simply do an amazing job as they are ultra sharp, not for the faint of heart or newbies</li>
    <li> Great deal. This is probably more than a years worth of blades for me. Incredible price and great convenience. It took at long time for them to arrive but that&#x27;s just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Exceedingly sharp! They certainly get the job done! Well worth the price per blade! I plan to buy more when I  run out, whenever that is.</li>
    <li> As described and very fast delivery. Smooth shaving almost every time! You could certainly find better but the price would be very hard to beat</li>
    <li> These Astra blades are sharp and durable. I get a week out of each blade, shaving daily.  I bought one of the sampler packs prior to this.  This is one of the best.  Couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a clean shave with all these disposable razors, hard to chose a good one so decided to go back to this type of razors and love how my skin feels</li>
    <li> I am starting out now using a DE razor for the first time. And the initial price is great as well as how long this will last me. The shave is good. I dont have any other blades to compare them to. But they last me for about 5 to 6 shaves and I figure thats a great deal. Beats spending all the money for disposables. And I travel so it takes up less space.</li>
    <li> I get 10 shaves give or take per blade. I think $11 a year for excellent blades is a deal. Baby butt smooth!</li>
    <li> Purchased these blades not knowing much about them. Now I do! Best blades that I have used. Shaves close and last longer than others that I have tried.</li>
    <li> For the money this product is awesome.  I get a clean close shave every time with minimal irritation.  I can only get two really good shaves with most blades and I could probably do 3 with this one, but towards the end it starts to dull.  As cheap as they are throwing away after two shaves isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
    <li> Very Very good Safety razor blades. I bought a pack of 100 over a year ago and have yet to run out.  These blades are very sharp and hold their edge quite well.  I would say I got about 2 weeks before changing my blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a steal of a deal considering modern razor blades cartridges are about $8+ apiece while these are $ .10 each and work just as well if not better than these new fancy 8 blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these and you wont be disappointed</li>
    <li> These are my blades of choice. I have tried many since starting to wet shave a few years ago, and this is my favorite! I am a straight razor shaver primarily, but when I use my Merkur Progress, there are the blades for me!</li>
    <li> I tried a number of blades when I got into DE-shaving, and what it came down to is these or Feather. I like a really sharp blade. Feather however is too sharp for me, i seem to get little nicks all the time no matter how careful I am. The Astras are still super sharp but way more comfortable and forgiving. I notice i can apply just a little more pressure and still not damage myself, but instead get an even closer shave.</li>
    <li> They work very well!  I&#x27;d buy them again!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves them. Fast Shipping Good Price</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and value. I&#x27;ve used many different brands and prefer these.</li>
    <li> The ones I have were made in Russia, I&#x27;ve read that some are made in other country&#x27;s. These made in Russia are great, and provide a smooth shave with one to two passes.</li>
    <li> astra platinum edge safety razors perform as advertised.  they are also economical and the shave is as good as any I&#x27;ve ever had.  I would buy this product again.  Each blade lasts me about seven days.</li>
    <li> Nice shave and cost efficient. Old school, no frills.</li>
    <li> Not for everyone, even though everyone is saying they are great.  They are a ok.</li>
    <li> These razors get the job done. They are very sharp. This is the first time I have bought a double edged razor so I don&#x27;t have much to compare them two, but I have two complaints. First, there is some sort of sticky substance on the blade. It isn&#x27;t a big problem, and I think its there to keep the wrapping on, but it can be a little annoying. Secondly, the razors come with no method for disposal. I don&#x27;t want to just throw the razor blades in the garbage because it seems like they could cut through the bag but I don&#x27;t really have any other choice.</li>
    <li> As a disclaimer, I haven&#x27;t tried the feather blades, which I hear are the absolute sharpest. But after reading several reviews about them, I discovered many people that said the Astras would be a great alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered my safety razor, it came with a 5-pack of the Astra blades, and I can say that I&#x27;ve really enjoyed them. Not once have I cut my face (though I did knick up my my head pretty good when I shaved it, though with more practice I&#x27;ll get that down). The blades separate the hair from my face quite easily. And with the shaving routine I have now, these 100 blades will probably last me about 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision to switch to safety razor shaving.</li>
    <li> Just finished my 100th Derby blade for their 100-pack, which took a while I might add! I bought these to try - immediately I could tell they were sharper and shaved better. I was glad I had tried an alternative to the Derby blades that were also as reasonably priced. Would recommend over the other blades.</li>
    <li> 100 Razors to last you for quite some time.  What else is there to say?  Great price and a great product.</li>
    <li> Huge money saver and a step back in time to when I watched my grandfather shave!</li>
    <li> These blades give a very close shave and are neatly packaged. The large container contains small packages of five blades each wraped in wax paper. A great product I will order time and again.</li>
    <li> Simply excellent. Very soft for my skin. After try others razor blades these don&#x27;t cut me. I believe i have find the correct blade for my face. You&#x27;ve got it try. I shave classic style.</li>
    <li> Great blades for a great price!!!  I know not all blades work for everyone but for the price you can&#x27;t not try these blades as they are some the most respected blades in the shaving world.</li>
    <li> Cuts just like a week old Feather blade.  Did feel good to me, the Feather brand blades seemed much sharper.</li>
    <li> great and incredibly sharp.  No irritation.  I cant imagine anyone having a complaint with these,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and you really cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> My Jagger razor came with a 5 pack of Derby blades that I thought were pretty good. That is, until I received the Astra&#x27;s. They are sharp, non irritating, and last about 5 shaves per blade on my beard.  And the cost is so low as to be silly.  I can not really see ever using another blade.  Buy them and enjoy!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these. If you want quality, durability, and value from your razor blades look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you get higher quality? Yes, but the difference in my opinion is marginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better durability? Sure, but there&#x27;s a fine line between durability and quality of the shave. I think these razors straddle the line perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value? Yeah. I haven&#x27;t found too many blades cheaper that have the quality of shave that I get from the Astras though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Astra has found the happy medium between quality, durability, and value. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use any other blades.</li>
    <li> After years of spending way too much one typical razors, I opted to the safety razor route. After going through a myriad of websites doing research I decided to make a purchase on a relatively cheap safety razor, a Van der Hagen shaving kit, and these razors. Suffice to say, I&#x27;ll be purchasing these again.    At first, I cut myself up quite a bit when first starting- a combination of getting used to a safety razor and these specific blades. After a little over a week my skin was comfortable and experiencing the best shaves it has ever had. My line of work requires me to be clean shaven and after an initial with the grain shave I go against the grain (usually on a daily basis). I do not experience the discomfort or burn from blades I&#x27;ve used in the past. I change out the blade whenever I encounter a great than average \\&quot;tug\\&quot; while shaving.    I purchased these a little over a year ago. I am now down to my last 4 packs (5 blades per.) I&#x27;ve saved well over $100 over that course of time if I were to buy traditional razor cartridges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been DE safety razor shaving since 1960.  Two or three decades ago I discovered platinum coated blades (I believe they were called Platinum Plus).  Once I tried a platinum coated blade I was hooked and haven&#x27;t used any other kind of blade since then ... I find that platinum on a blade is literally magic.  The past six years or so I&#x27;ve been using a platinum-chrome coated blade (made I think) by Personna.  Its been a good blade and I can get two months of shaving out of one blade ... so I don&#x27;t use more than 6 or 7 blades a year.   I&#x27;m on the first Astra blade now ... I&#x27;m testing it to see if it too will last for two months.    Update:  I changed out the Astra blade for a new blade on Friday (the fifteenth of August) as planned.  The Astra blade did fine for the entire two month period and provided a close shave even on the last day.  It did as good a job as any blade I&#x27;ve ever used. There are many good DE safety razor blades that one can buy ... and the Astra is one of them.  I&#x27;d be perfectly happy to buy a 100 blade pack of Astra blades again.  It did a good job for the entire two month period.</li>
    <li> Dirt cheap and better than any Gillette capsule I have used. Switch to DE shaving if you are on the edge (heh edge)</li>
    <li> Very good blades at a good price, they are sharp and last long.</li>
    <li> Easy to use packaging, and they&#x27;re basically a years supply. I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy them again,</li>
    <li> Plenty sharp. Shaves well and clean. Also who can beat shaving for these prices?</li>
    <li> Good razors they do a clean good shave and these kind way better then those expensive cartridges kinds. All you need is to invest in a straight blade or safety razor and your set for some savings</li>
    <li> I ordered these blades for a friend and he was very, very pleased with the order!!! Will order again when needed!!!</li>
    <li> I switched to old time shaving, it bothered me so to through away a plastic razor that would fill a land fill or end up in the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;I actually get a better shave so why not switch.</li>
    <li> These blades are a good middle of the road blade. They would work well for beginners or experienced wet shavers. They give me a good shave every time.</li>
    <li> Smooth Shave with no knicks!  Economical packaging, but Great quality, Nice smooth shave  !  Amazing $$ savings - Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> After spending years throwing money down the drain buying packaged double blades for an old Atra, my husband decided to go back to his own dad&#x27;s trusted style of shaving and he could not be happier with the results. These Astra blades are perfect for him and he gets three to four smooth shaves from each blade. We chose the Astra blades after reading a number of reviews and we are very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite blades.  Smooth and sharp.  A prefect blade for a beginner or a pro.  The price is right too.</li>
    <li> At about ten cents a piece you cant go wrong. I&#x27;m so tired of those expensive throw away plastic razors.&lt;br /&gt;These last longer and give a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you,&lt;br /&gt;Dennis</li>
    <li> After having shaved with a DE safety razor for several years, I keep coming back to the Astra blades for a reliable smooth shave. The price is quite right for what you get, which is 100 DE razor blades that come in 20 packs of 5 blades each. With each blade taking 2 shaves before needing the be replaced, this box of 100 lasts me almost an entire year. I also bought a 100 pack of Derby blades, and the Astras are much, much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Even using 1 blade per shave, the cost is still $0.10. That&#x27;s hard to beat with any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;-I like the way they shave. Not too sharp (like a feather blade) but not dull (like a derby blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-This is just for my face. I&#x27;d recommend you buy a sample pack with an astra blade in it, as it&#x27;s not for everyone. I know that people with coarser hair may not like them as much.&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes there is an occasional QC reject that shaves terribly. At least it&#x27;s cheap to replace it with another from the pack.</li>
    <li> This was my first set of blades purchased after my original one that came with my razor became dull. They&#x27;re as sharp as ever and have held an edge well so far.</li>
    <li> My razor is a Muhle R41 and I rotate different blades.&lt;br /&gt;I use these most often.&lt;br /&gt;They seem as sharp as Feathers but a little smoother.&lt;br /&gt;This was a good price and delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> The guys love them and they are cheaper then what they where using and they say they get a better shave</li>
    <li> Love these blades and love the price! I&#x27;ve seen a few people complaining about how quickly they wear out, and I would agree that they do wear fairly quickly. However, I find that they&#x27;re still definitely worth the cost and do a fine job for my legs, underarms, and bikini area, and I can usually get a few uses out of them for my legs and underarms before having to switch them out as long as I open up my safety razor and wipe off the blade.</li>
    <li> So happy I do not have to buy store razors anymore. If you have the razor to fit these bad boys buy it and live happy for the rest of your days. I switch out razors after 2 shaves just because I can, it is luxury life on a budget</li>
    <li> These blades are so flexible they bounce right over my beard, and fail to shave my face. After using these blades I went back to the disposable and it cleaned up where these blades failed. In fairness it could be the shaver I&#x27;m using so I will upgrade to a better safety razor and see if it can rehabilitate these blades.</li>
    <li> Astra is maybe my favorite &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; blade. You should be able to pick up a package of 100 blades for around $10 (or less); although a little scratchy, the Astra offers consistently good shaves on a variety of razors. And the blades last well, too.</li>
    <li> Great product and great value. I switched to safety razor shaving over a year ago and I would honestly never go back to the &amp;#34;cartridge blades&amp;#34; again. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of blades and also been happy- mostly &amp;#34;Merkur&amp;#34; blades made in Germany. While I liked those- these are a much, much better buy while still keeping the similar quality of the higher priced models. And with a 100 in a box- it will be quite a while before I need replenish the stock.</li>
    <li> thay are okay nt the sharps blads u can make do with them</li>
    <li> These blades are extremely sharp. Use with caution. The other choice are the japanese blades but they are very expensive.</li>
    <li> These are great razors at a great price.  That&#x27;s all there really is to say.</li>
    <li> These are the best - great shave reasonable price</li>
    <li> If you are a wet shaver you may be overlooking these little gems. They are not as sharp as a Feather DE blade or as long lasting, but they are pretty close. For me, these razors have struck a good balance between being smooth and sharp, which is what I most wanted. I only use them 3 times before I discard them, but at this price, why not. They are 1/3 the price of a Feather blade which is a bargain in my mind. Of course everyone has a beard and face that differs, so I would try a small pack before committing to 100.</li>
    <li> My regular blades are the [[ASIN:B000GCSFWW Wilkinson Sword Classics]], but at half the price, these were worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Astras feel softer on the skin and more forgiving than most of the other safety razor blades I have tested.  The blades feel thinner and more flexible.  However, thinner does not mean sharper in this case.  The Wilkinsons (and certainly others like [[ASIN:B0022R947O Feather Hi-Stainless]]) are much more aggressive and give you a closer shave at the cost of speed.  Where you can blaze through a shave using an Astra, that same pace with a Feather will leave your skin a ragged mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astras are not as durable as many other brands, but half the shaves for half the cost makes these an even deal in my book.</li>
    <li> Razor blades that work great. Assuming each blade lasts 1-2 weeks, I just bought a 2 year supply for next to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for nearly 8 months now and they work flawlessly. I will continue to buy these in the future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other brands, some quite a bit more expensive, before trying Astra. I won&#x27;t say any were &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;, they just each had their own qualities. That said, I find these to be the Goldilocks of razor blades I&#x27;ve tried.  I am Very Pleased with these blades. They give me a very comfortable close shave without &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;. On top of that, as a bonus, I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m getting more shaves from each blade. When considering the price, the choice is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I like these, surprisingly. Why surprisingly? They are cheap. I have used the dovo razor blades, as well as the merkur featherweights and these provide a clean cut, as well as the others. Overall, great buy.</li>
    <li> These are great blades. I tried a variety pack of a couple of dozen (mostly low-mid cost) blades, and Astra SP came out on top.  I also like them more than the Feather and Merkur which I had used before. They shave close and don&#x27;t cause much irritation.  They don&#x27;t last as long as some blades (about 3 shaves for me, 4 if I am not picky about closeness), but they are cheap enough that it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently tried Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock SP (black), which I think I like a bit more, but they are also more expensive too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, YMMV with blades.</li>
    <li> Great price on quality blades - save on shaving compared to expensive , fancy blades&lt;br /&gt;Clean shave , wrapped for safe and easy use</li>
    <li> Decent blades for a great price. They don&#x27;t seem quite as good as the Merkur blades, but at $10 for 100 blades it is tough to not be happy.</li>
    <li> It works as a razor should; much cheaper and better an using disposable razors. I need 10 more words here, so blah, blah, blah...</li>
    <li> DIRT CHEAP AND QUALITY BLADES!!!</li>
    <li> Best razor for my skin type with coarse hair. I use a Murker Futur.</li>
    <li> I got these as they were suggested by other reviewers for people with sensitive skin. They are!! I got no razor burn or irritation from these babies and I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin. Also amazing price compared to cartridge razors!</li>
    <li> i used to buy the Wilkinson brand at wal-mart, but they stopped carrying them. they were 10 pack for about $1.25. but only always had 1 or 2 in stock. i use a fresh blade every monday for the weekend shave, and the same blade for the rest of the week with no issues. this will last me for a long time even shaving every day. -1 star for being in packs of 5. i have been thinking of using a fresh blade every day to see if it is any different feeling...i dont want to have to go under the sink for a new pack every week. but thats just me being lazy. product is excellent.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer of my razor shipped a small pack of these with my razor when I bought it.  I bought one of the sample packs sold on amazon that had about 10 packs (of 10 blades each)  of different brands.  These are a perfect fit for my razor (a weber)</li>
    <li> I Love them! great price at $13. These will last me a very long time. I Love them! Good buy</li>
    <li> This is the blade for me. Great cheap shaves! No more paying through the nose for plastic cartridges and getting a so so shave. This is the ticket.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple blades before(black pack feather blades, blue bird, bic chrome platinum) and I prefer Astra over the rest. Astra is sharp enough to get a close shave where I don&#x27;t get a razor burn. I get two shaves per blade and don&#x27;t feel bad about throwing the blades away either. This is a very economical deal for your shaving habits.</li>
    <li> I have sampled various blades since starting my adventure with DE shaving and I think I have finally found THE ONE. I have a pretty thick stubble and I shave every other day. What I like the most about this blade is the buttery smoothness. And the cherry on the top is that I get at least 4 good shaves out if it. Smooth, sharp and goes long.</li>
    <li> I have my man-hood back and in style with my saftey razor double-edge shaving equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the order of things: I grew tired of my electric razor tugging on the whiskers and giving me nasty razor burn on one side of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;So I switched to cartridge razors, went through Gillette products including Sensor Excel, Mach 3(Turbo), Fusion, as well as Schick from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with cartridge razors.  I can make each cartridge last well over 3+ months if I really try, including isopropyl alcohol used to clean off the hard water deposits.&lt;br /&gt;They gave a decent shave, leading to satisfactory by the end of its life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found DE shaving -&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;(1) save money on blades [caveat - there&#x27;s a small pay back period,considering you have to buy the de equipment including de safety razor,brush,soaps if you want].&lt;br /&gt;(2) so much variety when it comes to soap/creams [more than 1/2 the fun for me is lathering up a nice smelling, slick/thick soap]&lt;br /&gt;(3) closer shave.  No doubt about it, you&#x27;ll be going for that extra pass, to obtain your baby - butt- smooth cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;(4) your partner will think you&#x27;re pretty slick having a nice shaving bowl and great smelling soaps in the bathroom, and a fancy brush or two.&lt;br /&gt;(5) regain a small portion of your man-hood by shaving with a potentially dangerous tool - the de razor blade!  That&#x27;s right, I have accidentally sliced myself once and proud of it ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;(1) steep learning curve.  You&#x27;ll be going at this for awhile, until you perfect your soap lathering skills &amp; unlearning the bad habits of cartridge razor shaving including applying too much pressure.  Yet it&#x27;s worth it. Oh, and I&#x27;m still learning.&lt;br /&gt;(2) obviously more dangerous.  Be careful handling the razor blades.  They are sharp as can be.&lt;br /&gt;(3) time consuming.  Eventually you&#x27;ll be quicker. Yet, you do still have to whip up your lather if you&#x27;re going the traditional route for thebetter shave.  Or just use Barbasol or Gillette Foamy if you&#x27;re in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding these blades.  The expression is Your Mileage May Vary.  Strangely enough, unlike cartridge razors, some de razor blade brands work well, others won&#x27;t.  You&#x27;ll know it but the tugging feeling on your whiskers.  So you&#x27;ve got to try sampler packs until you find one, or more, that work for you.  These ones happen to work for alot of people and at a fair price.  Good luck and enjoy your shave.</li>
    <li> Anyone who&#x27;s shaved with a DE razor for a while will tell you that you have to try different razors to get the right one for you. This is true, and in this case I took a gamble and lost kind of. I&#x27;d had a pack of these a while back and thought they were ok, so I picked up this huge set of them. Turns out something&#x27;s changed and I find I&#x27;m not as fond of them anymore. They seem to be less fluent across the skin on the strokes than I remember, resulting in a more than is common number of nicks. No for me personally, and I will probably stick with something else like Dorkos.  Three stars because the product isn&#x27;t terrible, and you get a whole barrel of them for a song.</li>
    <li> Good blades, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Good blades. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not the best but for 50 for 10$ can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
    <li> Tested 4 different blades this one was the best of the 4.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the glue.</li>
    <li> Never used a double edge razor before but combined these astra blades with a merkur long handle. Amazing shave using bar and brush with no nicks! Get these blades</li>
    <li> Loving these blades, they&#x27;re very sharp and don&#x27;t irritate my skin like other brands.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good. For the price, they are very good. They usually last about 4-5 shaves depending on what I do, but I only shave about two times a week. I&#x27;m not an expert of razors but these do the job well.</li>
    <li> The blades are great. They are made of metal and are sharpened on two sides. When applied to the hair on my face, they cut said hair effectively. As far as metal things that cut face hair go, these blades are the tops!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to DE shaving, and after trying these blades in a sampler pack, I was hooked. A ton of blades for much less than I used to pay for a package of cartridges and they work better to boot.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought the Brush, Soap, Blades and Stand years ago. Great shave. I will say that I use a Gilette three blade to get a tighter shave. But I use one blade every two weeks. Really awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome.  They&#x27;re the second single blades I&#x27;ve tried and hands down my fav.  Very light and smooth.  I shave probably 2-3 times a week and I probably get two weeks out of each blade.  For the money, these are a no brainer.  I use a shaving oil too, which is very affordable.  Once you go this route, you&#x27;ll laugh at anyone who buys Mach 3s or 4s or 20s for $4 each.  Straight up highway robbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do concede that there is one advantage to the Mach 3s though: the shock absorbers.  I have a mole on my cheek bone and with the Mach 3s I could just blast right over it and not worry.  With single blade shaving, you...ummm...can&#x27;t do that.  I end up hacking it wide open about every tenth shave.  Which blows because it bleeds a lot, but on the bright side, these blades are so sharp it doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these with a nice, heavy handle and you won&#x27;t look back.  Try an oil and apply it to a very wet, freshly showered/cleaned face.  Rinse with hot water then ice cold water.  A good lotion after the fact may not even be necessary.  It&#x27;s truly the only way to go.</li>
    <li> Really like these. Very sharp (obviously). Nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> The best shave I ever had, wonderful product ,WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> They do what razor blades are supposed to do.  They are packaged in multiple lightweight cardboard boxes inside a larger package.  They work fine for shaving.</li>
    <li> Good razor blades at a very reasonable price.  In my experience they are forgiving but do not provide as close a shave as I would like.  Still, for the price they are a great buy, especially if you don&#x27;t have a very coarse or very quirky beard.  Used with a Gillette Slim Adjustable set at 5.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the money,they don&#x27;t seem to nick me nearly as often as the Feather blades.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample pack with 76 different blades and as I was switching blades I didn&#x27;t notice any difference or it was insignificant. But when I put these in I was shocked they were cutting the hair so good I couldn&#x27;t believe it. And let me say this they actually cut better than Gillette Turbo that I have. Anyway these are the blades of my choice for now, at least until I find something better which I don&#x27;t think I ever will because I have already tried 10 different manufactures and these are by far the best.</li>
    <li> Excellent blade. Shaves better than my electric razor. No razor bumps after shaving .</li>
    <li> They work, but they&#x27;re not nearly sharp enough.  I&#x27;m not a fan of these, but I know there is a lot of personal preference and the characteristics of your beard that goes into picking a razor blade.  This one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I like these blade better than the Derby blades that came with a razor I ordered, but they are not as sharp as a Feather brand blade. If you nick or cut yourself easily this blade is a little more forgiving. Not a bad blade at all. Especially great for the value. Not a great blade either. Probably a good blade to acquaint yourself with DE or straight shavette shaving.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economical&lt;br /&gt;Sharp&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipped&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Its not amazing or the best but its good enough. I prefer Feather, but I don&#x27;t mind using these either.</li>
    <li> Some razors are sharp, some are VERY sharp, some shave so close it is probably a miracle, and some are just &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;....From all the reading I&#x27;ve done and talk with people it seems that is pretty much the norm.  That being said, good deal for good price.</li>
    <li> These blades are 100 times better than the Dorco brand that came with my razor.  First few shaves I did have some razor burn, but after my face adjusted to them it has gone away.  Real smooth shave.</li>
    <li> these are good blades, better, sharper than danby/derby whatever they are</li>
    <li> I use them with the Merkur HD 34C for an unbeatable combo!</li>
    <li> Great blades. I use a new one every time I shave, so I go through a box of these every few months. Unfortunately, I believe there&#x27;s a small quality-control issue, where a fresh blade will refuse to cut through certain hairs, leaving my skin &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; up around the hairs rather than cutting the hair instead. When I notice this (maybe once a month or so), I just toss the blade and use a new one. At first, I thought I might be shaving differently in those instances; maybe I was tired and sloppy, maybe my skin was being particularly difficult. However, since I have never experienced this with any other blade (and I&#x27;ve used countless others), I&#x27;m inclined to believe that these are to blame. Still, they do provide the best shave when they do work (which is most of the time), so I stick with them.</li>
    <li> It works as well as the more expensive disposible razors. I purchased it because I was spending too much on disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I should have bough this years ago. Its a better shave and cheaper than buying the over priced stuff at the drug store.</li>
    <li> because I was required to fill out this rating. I haven&#x27;t used razors yet, but intend to when I fill lake shaving</li>
    <li> I bought these at the same time as I purchased a sample pack of razors and these turned out to be by far my favorite out of all 10. These blades are decently sharp and last me about a week per blade. I am glad I bought in bulk.</li>
    <li> New to ths  type of shaving so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. So far the blades have expectations.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to shaving, I would recommend trying a sampler pack of different blades (and keeping notes) before you jump on a 100-pack.  OTH, these are so inexpensive that if they don&#x27;t work for you, it&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;re going to be unable to afford lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra was in my top-3 (close second to Super-Max) and it&#x27;s dirt cheap here on Amazon.  I&#x27;d characterize my skin as sensitive and my beard as tough -- it&#x27;s like trying to cut steel-wool.  I had a beard for ~20 years because I&#x27;d only get 1-2 shaves out of a cartridge razor before they were too dull to shave with and even the best cartridge was never sharp enough for cross-grain or against-grain strokes for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Astra will typically last me about a week.  Shave is FAR smoother than any cartridge I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Until I started DE shaving, I honestly thought the &amp;#34;BBS&amp;#34; (Baby-Butt-Smooth) shave was a descriptive hyperbole, but it&#x27;s actually very simple to achieve in reality with a good blade when DE shaving.  Cross-grain and Against-grain stokes are fine for me, too.</li>
    <li> Super sharp great blade!  Also bought feather&#x27;s, merkur blades, and some others however these are by far the best and way sharper!</li>
    <li> Nice.  Sharp.  I use them for trimming thread from fishing rods I am building.</li>
    <li> The combination of affordability and performance are why I have rated these 5 stars. I use these on my head and face with no problems and because they are so inexpensive, I am able to use a fresh blade for every shave and still pay WAY less than what I was used to with the Gillette fusion cartridges (which I would have to suffer through at the end of the week as the blades will dull and tug).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Pro Glide 12 pk: $37 ($3.08 a blade). 5 face shaves and 3 head shaves in one week then throw away cartridge (otherwise head and face just started to get jacked up). 52 weeks a year x $3.08&#x3D; $160 in cartridges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra SP 100 pk $9 ($.09 a blade). 8 Shaves a week &#x3D; $.72 x 52 weeks a year &#x3D; $37.44 in DE blades . Yes please- I think I&#x27;ll buy some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t quite as sharp as my Feather blades but they are more forgiving. I&#x27;m able to shave my face everyday without issue. With the Feathers, I start to get pretty sensitive as the week progresses with everyday shaving. I will still use the feathers if I need a super tight shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you go through as many blades as I do, Astra SP blades are the way to go. If you&#x27;ve never heard of DE shaving, do some research. I think you&#x27;ll find that it just makes sense.</li>
    <li> Good deal on a helluva lot of razors.</li>
    <li> This is my first blade purchase ever, so I don&#x27;t have experience with any other brand to compare them to, so the only thing that I can say about them is that they do cut, and cut right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in packs of 5, individually wrapped. To me, they are fine blades, I am happy with them as they have a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless somebody gives me a blade from another brand that turns out to be better, I really would have no need to switch brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them. They were a good buy.</li>
    <li> As everyone on the shave forums says YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary). I tried these popular blades and felt they were pretty mediocre. Not even close in sharpness with the Personna blues. Sharper than the Dorco-ST 301 (though what isn&#x27;t?) I imagine you might like these Astra&#x27;s if you have soft peach fuzz. My beard hairs are very tough but I&#x27;m young and have soft sensitive skin so I need something that is sharp and smooth. These are smooth but not sharp.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as well as previous brands. try going with something else. I&#x27;m stuck with 100 of these for a while.</li>
    <li> Bought this for use with my Edwin Jagger DEL89L, and they provided an excellent shave.  I am used to Derby blades, but I believe I prefer these.</li>
    <li> Blades may feel different for different people, but you should at least grab some of these in a sample pack somewhere and give them a try. I thought Derby blades were a great blade until I heard someone using these astras on a YouTube video, and included them in a sample pack.  I was amazed at the smoothness of these blades!  I get 4-5 shaves out of them before I notice them beginning to pull, and even then the pull is not that bad.  I have an average to heavy beard, and need to shave everyday (if I have to work). I use these in a Merkur Progress razor, and a Gillette Slim adjustable.  Works great in both.  They shave similar to a Feather blade, but I find Feathers dull more quickly, usually after 2-3 shaves.  I seem to get more irritation when using Feathers also. Feathers are also much more expensive.  I have used many different blade brands to find the right one for me, and none come close to these astras for performance AND price! These come in 10 little 5 pack cardboard boxes.  These may feel differently in different razors, but in the ones I use they are great!</li>
    <li> Good quality blades.  Throw away after 5 shaves.  If you use more than that you&#x27;ll nick the heck out of your face.</li>
    <li> I bought these shortly after starting to use a safety razor. These are by far the best razors yet. I will be purchasing them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen blades in my 1974 Super Speed, including Feather, Shark, and others (two different sampler packs).  These have worked best for me.  I get a very close shave with almost no irritation (usually chalked up to soap problems) and very few nicks (maybe two per week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Factor in that this is 100 blades for $10, and you almost can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Nice blades&lt;br /&gt;Give a good shave&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give a tail a friend about them&lt;br /&gt;I used one today they gave a close shave</li>
    <li> They are usable but probably the worst I&#x27;ve used over the past two years with my razor.</li>
    <li> I used to be that guy who purchased a new Gillette Mach 3 whatever, whenever it started to pull the hair out by the root, rather than glide across my face.  $9.99 a pop because I thought, &amp;#34;I ain&#x27;t spendin&#x27; no $40 on a pack of 8 refills THIS time around.&amp;#34;  So I got lured in by the hype of that ASOTV safety razor and thought... &amp;#34;What&#x27;s $20 if it saves me on the first month of use?&amp;#34;  Well, it took some getting used to the older style, and my lip lost more than a centimeter of flesh in getting the movements down, but now I shave every single morning with these blades, and I can&#x27;t stop giggling myself to sleep at night thinking about all of the money I&#x27;m saving by NOT buying those 13-bladed monsters that leave you feeling like you need to pull a few tricks at the corner to afford every month.  Plus... I feel like a man&#x27;s man when I heft that steel bastard up to my cheek and let it do it&#x27;s single bladed thing.  It freakin&#x27; works people.  Put down the lady razors and stop wasting money on that Gillette rip-off.  You&#x27;ve been throwing money down the toilet all this time.  At around $10 for 100 of these blades, you can&#x27;t afford NOT to try them for yourself.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors I have ever used...period 👍🏼</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used. I have tried about 5 or 6 other blades. Nothing compares to this blade. These last longer than any other blade, and are sharper!</li>
    <li> Very low quality. There is a wax from the rapping in every single blade and my Derby blades, shave way better. This is going to the trash can.</li>
    <li> This blade seemed to lose lots of it&#x27;s sharpness after just one shave. At around 10 cents per blade it is still a good value even if you only shave with each blade twice.</li>
    <li> Astra blades work very nicely for me with my Merkur safety razor; my purchase was premised upon another Amazon customer! Thanks for the &amp;#34; heads &amp;#34; up !!</li>
    <li> These blades work great, they&#x27;re very sharp, they cut my face every time I shave but also leave my face smooth all day.</li>
    <li> I recommend getting a sampler pack if you are new to DE razors.  You need to find the blade that works best with your skin type and beard type.  These were by far the best for me, especially considering the price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, everyone&#x27;s face is different, but if these work for you, they seem to be a consistently manufactured, quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lately discovered (when I bought these 4 months ago) safety razors and have no doubt I am a lifetime convert. I tried razor after razor, constantly going back to my Mach 3 Turbo&#x27;s but when my friend told me about safety razors when I was considering signing up for one of the dollar shave clubs, he recommended this brand and gave me one of his many packs. Turns out, I can use the same blade for at least a month (I only shave once a week, perks of being a self-employed handyman) but the shave quality with the Astra blades matches the original Merkur blade that came with my safety razor and as a plus- IT IS A GREAT DEAL. Doing the math- I basically can get 8 years of shaving blades for 10 dollars. I pushed Mach 3&#x27;s to the limit, but I&#x27;ll tell ya- it can&#x27;t beat this for the shave or cost. If I treated the Mach 3 cartridges the same way, I would spend roughly... $200 for the same amount of blades. We can all do that math :D I love it! I&#x27;ll probably buy 7 or 8 more packs and be more than set for life... for $80. Sounds like a great deal!!</li>
    <li> Works good for me in my Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good too. Honestly, I prefer these to the more expensive Wilkinsons.</li>
    <li> I will buy more of these blades.</li>
    <li> AWESOME BLADES  FOR SMOOTH SHAVE</li>
    <li> The are so many! And they work pretty well without creating too many bumps if you know how to shave right. Highly recommend the product Bump Patrol as aftershave</li>
    <li> They seem to do the job. Have yet to replace the first blade after 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Love these blades. Been using them for two years now. Price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I can get 5 days from the same blade as long as I clean them after use, no nicks or cuts, and they are cheap enough that 5 shaves is good enough for me</li>
    <li> These are good blades. Very sharp.</li>
    <li> A great price on platinum coated razors!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have been very generous with my use of these blades. I usually shave 2-3 with each blade. I shave 2-3 per week, at this rate 100 blades will last me almost 2 years. Not bad for $12</li>
    <li> Great no tugging way better then derby.</li>
    <li> I dont really know how good these are - they are for my boyfriend</li>
    <li> Far superior to the Derby blades that came with my Edwin Jagger DE89 safety razor, much sharper and smoother. No razor burn like with the Derbys. Awesome, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great price per shave.</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as Derby. I know these are supposed to be sharper but they just feel very jagged. If you need the sharpest you want to go with Feather razors because otherwise might as well go with Derby razors because these don&#x27;t seem as good quality as either of those.</li>
    <li> This item is working just as I expected.</li>
    <li> Great blades, sharp and not costly</li>
    <li> I will not need razors for two years.</li>
    <li> About 10 cents apiece, gives me a good shave.</li>
    <li> makes shaving cheap, and these blades work well for me</li>
    <li> I am rewriting this review because after being able to compare these blades with more than I did previously I feel it justified a fresh take on them. I have tried some of the more expensive blades since then, such as Feathers and Gillette Silver Blues, in addition to the Merkur, Derby, Shark, and Personna Blues I mentioned before. These Astra blades are STILL my favorite blade out of all of them. The Gillette SB blades come close but the Astras are just a little bit smoother for me. Even though there&#x27;s a lot out there I have not tried I just don&#x27;t see the point if these give me excellent quality shaves. And for a third of the price of Feathers, which may be really sharp but feel a bit harsh on my skin, these Astras are a no-brainer. I&#x27;ve used them in a bunch of razors too - Edwin Jagger, Merkur, VDH, Parker, Feather Popular, several vintage Gillettes - they performed great in all of them. They&#x27;re simply awesome blades and can&#x27;t be beat for such a great price too.</li>
    <li> the blades are unreal,i have a heavy beard and between  these blades and the Edwin jagger de89lbl razor. ican get 5 shaves using plain liquid soap.</li>
    <li> Great blades and great price</li>
    <li> A reaction to the lubricating strip on cheap disposable razors turned out to be the source of a persistant rash on my neck, so I sought relief by returning to double edge shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 300 Astra blades on the strength of reviews alone, which is a dangerous thing to do, but turned out okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fast-growing, medium heavy beard and typically do a modified one-pass shave: mostly down, but down and up in a few places. Call it a one and a half pass shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Astra blade gives me five comfortable shaves. The sixth is not uncomfortable but there is a hint of drag. Almost 50 years of shaving experience tells me it&#x27;s time for a fresh blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six good shaves means a blade lasts me a week, since I usually skip shaving one day to give my face a rest. I should get more than five and a half years of use from these 300 blades, which works out to under five dollars a year. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a little info about my shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a shaving brush and a regular bar of soap. (By the way, a good shaving cup is a small, black plastic bowl designed for chip dip. It looks good, is the perfect size and shape, has a textured surface that helps whip up an excellent lather, doesn&#x27;t clang when you stir the brush in it, doesn&#x27;t break if you drop it, and sells for a dollar. I got mine for a quarter at a thrift shop.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My razor is an old Gillette butterfly type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face prep consists of lathering, letting it sit for a minute, washing it off with a hot, wet washcloth, then lathering a second time for the shave. Lather touch-ups are done as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each day after shaving, I remove the blade, shake it off, hold it firmly in the middle from one unsharp side and flick the other, as if playing a jaw harp. I then hold the opposite side and flick again. I also blow on the blade to help dry it. This little routine takes about a minute. I shake the razor itself dry, put the blade back in, and close the head loosely, not clamping it down tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor and brush hang in a homemade metal stand.</li>
    <li> The price was great, half of what others want, or far less. So far I have gotten about six shaves on the first blade and I do not expect to have to change in the next week but that may change (see my review on the VDH Luxury Shave kit). The offered subscription is mind boggling; two-thirds or more blades per day in a six month or less period, astounding. Clark Howard will tell you if you let it dry they will last at least a month. A stand is helpful. I am using them in a vintage Gillette Adjustable Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been about another two weeks or so and I am finding more out about these blades. I used one side of the blades for about two weeks and could tell that side was getting a bit dull. Then I noticed the blades are numbered, 1-4, so used one edge for a week or so, go to the next edge, flip the blade over and use 3 and 4. One blade should last you about a month. 100 blades should be about 9 years worth. Getting about 4 or five weeks per blade.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about these razors?  They&#x27;re dirt cheap, each blade is very sharp and lasts about a week or longer, and there are 100 of them.</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck by far. Do not expect to get multiple shaves from each razor.Save so much money per year.</li>
    <li> Cheap and they work well.. I&#x27;d buy again. Ive had them for a good while now and still have much much more.</li>
    <li> I got into safety razor use a couple years ago and I found these blades to be a perfect complement to the Merkur razor I use and my face. It&#x27;s really an individual preference/hair type/face type/razor combination that will determine if they&#x27;re best for you or not, but these are now tied for my favorite.</li>
    <li> Blade preference is completely individual. That said these work extremely well for me. No nicks and a very smooth shave. Much better than those I have tried that cost ten times as much.</li>
    <li> you could get 100 blades for such a cheap price? Very cost efficient, good for the budget. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
    <li> Wow.  The negative reviews are right these blades are very poorly made.  Buyer beware you will need to hone the blade before you use it.</li>
    <li> great blades, really sharp. hold their edge a long time, amazing value for the money. best i&#x27;ve tried (of 10+ brands)</li>
    <li> An amazing deal. Will take years to use all the blades! High quality blades.</li>
    <li> They work great for me. Don&#x27;t remember how long it took to receive.  No problems. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite cheap razors.</li>
    <li> Astras aren&#x27;t the most talked about blades, they aren&#x27;t the sharpest blade out there.  But what it does provide is that perfect &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; of being &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; yet &amp;#34;perform&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Feathers (out of the box an fresh) ahve given me a closer shave than Astra (pretty impressive for a middle of the road sharp blade).  But of course, Astra is far more comfy and reassuring - you&#x27;re never scared or think you will hurt yourself - and it&#x27;s because you probably won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the Astras shine and excel though.. is after the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th shave compared to other blades i&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s performance and comfort is seemingly identical from shave 1 to shave 5 (most other blades, espeically the sharper ones - seem to have a very noticeable deterioration on comfort and performance starting with shave 2 - (must explain i have very thick, strong, coarse hair).  And that is the Astra difference and why it&#x27;s become my blade of choice over Feather, Personna, Derby, Wilkinson.</li>
    <li> Some very fine blades. No more razor burn! These blades work very well for me, however you must make sure you try a few brands before buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> These blades shvave nice and have no complaints about the blade quality or results.  I have a Parker razor and I rarely get knicked but get a close shave.  I get two or three shaves out a blade before changing it out.  The blades sit nicely in my Parker and look very even when tightened down.  I can only compare them to the Shark brand Egyptian blades that came with my razor, which worked well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the paper wrappers are glued to the blade a bit too well on the ones I have.  It makes it harder to remove the wrapper than the shark blades.  I haven&#x27;t cut my self getting one out of the individual wrapper, but I&#x27;m very careful obviously when handling a new blade.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the wrapper glue issue, I&#x27;d give five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is nice and was my main reason for giving them a try.  These will last me quite a while, but will be tempted to try something else with good reviews next time.</li>
    <li> This box of razors is an insanely good value. The razors themselves are quite thin; some may prefer that while others may not. They seem to last for about 5 or 6 shaves, at which point they start to irritate the skin a bit. One thing I can tell you is that, unlike other razors, these don&#x27;t seem to get those jagged edges that produce accidental cuts when they are old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let&#x27;s sum up: These razors are (1) very economical, (2) as durable as other razors, (3) thin/lightweight, and (4) do not produce rough edges as they age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors don&#x27;t get much better than that.</li>
    <li> Cut myself a lot kind of the first few uses,thank god for the nick stick. Finally got the hang of it though and no more cutting. Not bad</li>
    <li> Sharp and very smooth. Works well in all of my razors. Definitely on my short list of buy again blades.</li>
    <li> I like these blades, they are well balanced. I shave my face and my head with these. If you are a head shaver and you&#x27;ve never used a DE razor before, go easy with these blades until you get a decent technique down. You don&#x27;t need to apply any pressure, just guide the razor along your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal.  its bonafides have been vetted.  this is what your dad or grand dad would use.  stop using the other overpriced bs.  I&#x27;m actually trying to upgrade to the single safety razor like they use in the old time shops.</li>
    <li> I just started shaving with a safety razor. I started with the merkur sample blade that came with the long handled Merkur razor. I could tell that the merkur blades weren&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Astra blades work better than the merkur. Some are super sharp and some only last one shave. You&#x27;ll have to get a feel for the blades. For the price, they are great. They will last me until Christmas, and then I&#x27;ll probably get a sample pack to see what really works best for my face.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers these blades for a close shave at a good price. That&#x27;s what I got out of him but consider it high praise since he rarely comments on a product one way or another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Formerly I was a loyal Wilkinson blade aficianado, but the Astras are actually a bit better and a lot cheaper.  At around ten cents a blade, it gives an incredibly close shave with no drag and rarely a nick.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you still using those idiotic multi-blade ridiculously expensive blades and gimmicky razors, consider switching to a double edge razor.  Any of the Parker Heavyweights available on Amazon are thoroughly excellent and they will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> One of the smartest purchases that I&#x27;ve ever made. These blades are perfect! They&#x27;re even numbered 1-4 on the corners so you can keep track of when you use each side of the blade. 100 blades X 4 sides &#x3D; 400 shaves. When I bought these. They were still priced under US$9.00. I&#x27;ll never pay $27.00 for some some 4 or 5 blade shaving system. I think these even do a better job then my old twin blade Sensor razor.</li>
    <li> I had previously used Derby blades and moved on to using Feather ones.  I really didn&#x27;t care much for the Derby blades and had settled on the Feather ones since I had ordered a lot of them at a good price.  They did the job, but I still thought there might be a better blade out there for me.  I read the reviews on the Astra blades and decided to give them a try.  I went ahead and ordered 100 of them at a great price, so even if they were just average it would still be worth the money.  After trying them, I&#x27;ve found that I like them the best out of the blades I&#x27;ve tried thus far.  They give me a close shave with fewer nicks than the Feather.  I could use my blades more than one time, but I normally change them out every time I shave my legs.  Even though I do this, I&#x27;m still saving a ton of money versus disposable razors or razor refills.  And the shave I get is way better.  I highly recommend these blades to anyone still searching for the right blade.  This may be the one for you.</li>
    <li> nice close shave,long lasting edge</li>
    <li> These are very sharp long lasting blades that are a very good value when you buy in bulk. The $10 that I spent will last me more than a year.</li>
    <li> I had bought a cheap safety razor on Amazon, its actually great, and it came with a cheap blade. It felt rough and pulled the hair quite a bit. I though all safety blades where going to be like that but then I heard of Astra blades and how great they where. I decided to order them not knowing what to expect, then they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades looked nice. When the blade went down my face I had though I had put the blade the wrong way. I didnt feel it do anything. I had a closer look and I was impressed!&lt;br /&gt;It was smooth as butter. The blades felt nice! Not pulling on my hairs, and the blade didn&#x27;t feel rough at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> Awesome blades for my tough beard but sensitive skin. Super price, great quality and perfect service. You can sample others but these rock. Cuts through tough beards like a hot knife through butter.</li>
    <li> After switching to safety razors I sampled 10 different brands of razors to see which one works the best. With Astra I had the smoothest shaves and decided to purchase this box of 100 razors.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a blade that would take it easy on the sensitive skin on my throat, &amp; these blades work wonders. They&#x27;re also really affordable compared to most other brands. Only really good for one shave, but with my coarse hair, that&#x27;s pretty much how it is with every blade I&#x27;ve tried. All in all, a great deal. Definitely worth a shot, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Really low price for the quality of the blades.  Just moved to wet shaving and this pack of razors will last a while.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend these razors enough.  While there are, of course, a wide variety of brands available, I tend to prefer the Astra and Merkur, both seem to feel the same to me.  However, what puts these on top is the price and the amount.  It&#x27;s 100 blades for next to nothing in terms of pricing, and they should easily last you months and months.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of blades and for the quality of these blades at the prices available they can not be beat</li>
    <li> I decided to get the Astra blades after ordering a sample pack and liking the 5-pack of Astras included with it.  The Feather blades are really good too, but I am happy with my Astra purchase.  They feel so much better than the Gillette blades that also came with the sampler pack.</li>
    <li> Having switched from Derby Extra to these, I&#x27;m amazed at the difference. Let&#x27;s list the good things first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They last forever. I&#x27;ve used one blade for nine or ten shaves now, and it&#x27;s still sharp enough that I have no reason to replace it yet.&lt;br /&gt;2. They&#x27;re at the right level of sharpness for my beard. With Derby Extras, I would cut myself because the blade wasn&#x27;t quite sharp enough. With Feathers, I would cut myself because the blade was too sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say about them. The best razor blade I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
    <li> Each blade has been great so far, I like the large package with the little 5 blade packs inside so I can take the smaller boxes with me traveling. Each one cuts great, and are a much better shave for a fraction of the cost of my old cartridge blades</li>
    <li> These are sharp and are a great price. They last about 4 shaves. I only use a 2 pass method. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I just switched to a DE blade and these suckers will do the trick for way less than I was paying Gillette. 4/5 stars because I grabbed the razor too hard my first time and but my finger up good when i was installing it. In conclusion if you respect these blades they will give you a damn good shave,</li>
    <li> These Astra Superior razorblades provide a quality shave day in and day out. I&#x27;ve used exclusively Feather blades for years but after paying premium prices I decided to look for a passable replacement. These do a fine job; definitely not as sharp but they do a fine job on just one pass, even better with two passes. They rank right up there with the Bluebird, not quite as sharp as the top drawer blades but they so a fine job.     I&#x27;ve been using double edge blades now for about 28 years, from Gillette, to Schick and other blades from other countries. Most problems that I&#x27;ve encountered with the majority of blades have been with my shaving methods. I can get a good shave out of almost any blade, but some blades just take too much work - Astra won&#x27;t. The glue has been a non-issue with me. I&#x27;ve used them in superspeeds, merkurs, probaks, and other two/three piece razors.    p.s. I am not an advocate of the three pass shaving system. Usually, I do a with the grain, then an across the grain pass - an against the grain pass - even after the other two reducing passes - is just to severe for me, with any blade.    Enjoy your shaves!</li>
    <li> I bought these razors over a year ago when I purchased a safety razor.  I have gone through an entire package and have not complains.  They cut extremely close.  I&#x27;m on my second 100 count package now.</li>
    <li> Way  better than the Derby&#x27;s I started with.  I can usually finishing shaving in two lathers now.  No nicks either.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller. Fast delivery and the product was a terrific value and exactly as described. These are fairly sharp blades and qiuite forgiving considering. My hubby gets 4 or 5 shaves out of each and is quite pleased with them. Goodbye to those outrageously expensive fancy shmancy 5 blade razors that don&#x27;t give as good a shave. Would recommend this company to everyone.</li>
    <li> Why buy expensive razors when you can get these for cheap? Work well for a few days, then throw away, and what do you know, you&#x27;ve still got 99 more.</li>
    <li> Seriously, the value you get for these razors is the best you&#x27;ll find anywhere. Perfect for beginners to safety razor shaving, you can practice with these until you find a higher quality brand or just revel in the fact that you&#x27;re paying cents on the dollar for a close shave compared to other standard disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I have just have changed from conventional razors to safety razor and could not be more pleased.  Reading the reviews for the blades made it very easy to choose.  you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was new to double edge shaving. I ordered these because of the great price for so many razors. Now I have tried about a dozen other brands to include feather and a few different Gillettes. So far these are the best value while still maintaining quality.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and had to find a good razor for my new razor. after reading other reviews i chose these and they were spot on. Great shave and last 4-5 shavings. so much cheaper than buying the crap big name newage razors.</li>
    <li> I received Derby blades with my Edwin Jagger razor but I bought these Astra blades on the price.  I have no complaint with these blades.  I get a very smooth and irritation free shave with them and I only shave but every two-three days with no problems.  I used a Mach3 for some years but went back to DE wet shaving and now I can&#x27;t articulate why I ever changed to the Mach3.</li>
    <li> Shaves as close as a multi blade razor. It is much better than I expected. I&#x27;m still surprised after three weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Each blade will only last one shave (at least for me), but I like the idea of having a new, clean, sharp blade every time I shave. Each box contains 20 packs of 5 blades each, which makes it easier to store for people who have limited bathroom storage space like myself.</li>
    <li> For the cost of the Astra blades, you cannot go wrong. I have been using these blades for one month. I have not found any issues or problem with them. I have sensitive skin, I love these blades!!</li>
    <li> These blades have worked more than great. I&#x27;ve only had one &amp;#34;not so great blade&amp;#34; out of the about 25 I&#x27;ve used. These are incredibly sharp and I&#x27;ll defiantly be buying them again.</li>
    <li> The choice of double edge blades is a very personal one.  I chose these after getting the variety pack.  This cost of these blades is less than 10 cents each.  They are very good blades for ONE shave.  After one shave they is a severe degradation in sharpness.  So with the low price I do  not feel guilty using them for just one shave.  I am still saving quite a bit over the 5 blade vibrating monsters sold by  Gillette.</li>
    <li> Offers an excellent shave for the price</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not quite the best blades out there, but for the price the Astras can&#x27;t be beaten.</li>
    <li> Much better than the brand Feather I replaced. I don&#x27;t feel like I shaved with lava...</li>
    <li> Great safety razor blades.  Very sharp and get about 4-6 shaves per blade before I change them.</li>
    <li> Hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> These DE blades are great. Smooth and sharp. Comparable to the Gillette super platinum (black pkg) only smoother!This is my favorite blade! [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]</li>
    <li> These Astra blades are a perfect compliment to my Merkur FUTUR. A very close smooth shave with absolutely no drag or discomfort to subtract from a rather enjoyable tonsorial experience (heh-heh)!</li>
    <li> Item as described,  better then the other brand I used</li>
    <li> My new, go-to DE safety razor blades. They are sharp, yet forgiving and smooth. Durability is excellent and the price makes it an amazing value.</li>
    <li> these blades are for the price good but just not for me, they are definatily a great value and if you find they agree with your face can be a absolute treasure. Unfortunately for me they just werent sharp enough and even with 4 passes i wasnt happy with the results. my facial hair is comparable to steel wool. The reason i didnt give it less than 3 stars is because blades depends on person to person how thick your beard is how you prepare before your shave what razor you use ect ect, so not for me could be the absolute best for someone else.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for 10 years and just switched to using a DE blade. These were perfect for me, not too strong but sharp enough for me.</li>
    <li> Cheap but with good quality.</li>
    <li> I have tried these and Feather brand. These are a little cheaper than Feather and do a great job. They are not quite Feathers,  but I&#x27;d still use them. They work well for my sensitive skin anyway.</li>
    <li> Incredible blades! I just recently started wet shaving again &amp; thought I would try these after reading positive reviews. I prefer these blades over Dorco &amp; Merkur. Blades were very smooth &amp; provided my closest shave to date.</li>
    <li> 10 10 10. Awesome blades. Have purchased 500 blades.</li>
    <li> very sharp, have not a complaint, wish I would have switched sooner. Just wish they came with a disposer for used blades.</li>
    <li> Good product and ineexpensive, maybe the Japanese blades are better, but these work well at $10 for a hundred blades.</li>
    <li> i bought these as a replacement for my merkur safety razor which had been using merkur blades for over a year.  The first couple shaves with these were w bit rough, got razor burn decently bad the first time.  However, I think it took a few times for my face to get used to them and now I love the shave and have no issues. What i would reccomend is the first time you use this to lather your face up very generously and only go down with one pass through-  probably not the best shave but for the first time or two I would do this while your face gets used to the blade.  after that should be smooth sailing</li>
    <li> Excellent blades, even better that the stainless. Keeps the sharp edge longer than the stainless.</li>
    <li> They are ok. Prices kept going up each month to make it not wort the cost. The cost to value was not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> These blades provide a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I got this blade in a sampler. First initial shave was smooth and close. I feel pretty neutral about this blade but I don&#x27;t dislike it. I did 2 shaves with this blade before I moved on to my next sample blade.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This has been the only blade I&#x27;ve used aside from the blades that came with my Edwin Jager DE89. They seem to be much higher quality and provide a better pass than the other blades. For the price and coming from cartridge razors I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Great blades. These are the best blades I&#x27;ve found so far but YMMV.</li>
    <li> Works great. Sharp everytime, and it takes about one week and a half before they start to dull ever so slightly when taken out of the package wrapper (and I live in humid Florida).</li>
    <li> These blades are alright but as I&#x27;ve mentioned in several other blade reviews, the best blades for me seem to be the Feather brand in my Feather razor.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I made the switch to shaving with a safety razor.  Unlike many who review these products I don&#x27;t pretend it gives me a better shave than my old Mach 3, in fact I&#x27;ll admit it is usually a little worse.  But I like shaving with a safety razor, so  I&#x27;ve kept at it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, after I bought my Merkur shaver I invested in a couple of years worth of blades by buying 100 blade packs by 7 AM ([[ASIN:B0017ZECA6 B0017ZECA6]] and Sharp ([[ASIN:B0017QSSIC B0017QSSIC]] both were entirely reliable and inexpensive options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few years when those ran out, I (foolishly) opted to try a new brand, hence this review.  These Astra blades are noticeably flimsier, go dull much more quickly, and provide a less-even shave than the blades I&#x27;d used in the past.  There is a glue residue left behind on all of the blades, something that I found on none of the other brands I&#x27;d purchased, and I&#x27;m just overall less impressed with the Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the high number of reviews, mostly positive, influence my decision to try these out, and I know my review is unlikely to change anyone&#x27;s mind who likes these blades or is trying out double-edge shaving for the first time.  But if you are like me, and satisfied with a previous blade purchase and wondering if you should give these Astra&#x27;s a shot, I highly recommend you stick with the brand you know and skip these.  I suspect that like me, you&#x27;ll be very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great value - gives a very close shave for a fraction of the price of the alternatives!</li>
    <li> I had no clue what blade to buy. I bought these only because of the price. Man was I amazed how well they do. I shave not only my face but also my head. Therefore blades are very important. I had been using those $900 3,4,5,6,200 or whatever blade they are on now. These blades will out perform them barnone. I have a close shave without any irrataion. I cannot compare to other single blades nor do I want to. I will stick with these.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp! They also don&#x27;t irritate and last a good number of shaves! I&#x27;ll be using these for quite some time!</li>
    <li> Purchased these in conjunction with my first DE razor, a Merkur, which came with one blade. I shave my head and face every other day and these blades tend to last about two weeks before needing to be changed; the Merkur blade barely made it one and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price, love the quality.</li>
    <li> Good razors at an unbeatable price</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower daily, an Astra Premium Platinum Blade lasts me a week maybe ten days.&lt;br /&gt;I am in the habit of rinsing the blade &amp; wiping it dry after every use...rust dulls any edge fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll easily get a year &amp; a half out of this 100 pack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a very close shave with this brand.  I sort of chuckle at the guys in the shaving aisle buying those expensive 3 or 5 blade refills.  The Astra blade cost breaks down to .12 cents a blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they only knew going back in time would save them $$$&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product from Astra!</li>
    <li> These are top notch double edge blade. You won&#x27;t go wrong getting these. The provide a great shave and you can get 2-5 shaves out of each blade depending on how strong your beard is. You should find these to be one of you top ten blade choices, or so I would imagine. I personally put them in my top 5 right now, but I am still experimenting.</li>
    <li> TL;DR - I&#x27;ve tried Derby, Shark Super Chrome, and these Astras. I like these Astras the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello all.  I&#x27;m fairly new to DE shaving, but I wanted to share my experience with Astras.  I switched to DE shaving about a year ago, and I am never going back.  I&#x27;ve used every Schick and Gillette disposable razor or cartridge that I&#x27;ve ever heard of, but I always had redness and/or razorbumps, especially on my neck.  I tried fancy soaps, fancy face wash, fancy shave creams, and the like, but nothing made it go away.  Finally, about a year ago, I switched to DE using a razor handle purchased on Amazon.  I started with Derby blades, then moved on to Shark Super Chrome.  Right away, the shaving experience with the Derby blades was more enjoyable and also more affordable (7 cents per day for a new blade vs a $2.30 cartridge every week).  The Derby blades were a fantastic place to start, but on someone&#x27;s recommendation I tried Shark Super Chrome.  These blades felt even better, and I only had to switch blades every other day.  Within a few months into DE shaving with Shark Super Chrome, razor bumps were a thing of the past, and redness was almost entirely gone.  When I ran out of Shark Super Chrome, I decided to give these Astras a try, and they are AMAZING!  After shaving for a few days, the blade is still so sharp that I do not feel any friction or resistance shaving my thick beard.  I am still planning on trying other blades, but these are my favorite by far.</li>
    <li> I got these for my father to go with his Parker razor blade and he loves them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has pretty course hair and loves the results that he gets with these along with the fact that he doesn&#x27;t need to change them as often as his old Shark razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice blades at a great value and definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Blades are great. With all the fancy razors out there for the preppies there still is nothing like a good old fashioned double edge shave.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades.  That said, I have not tried many others yet.  I&#x27;v used a couple merkurs which I thought were inferior in sharpness and smoothness.  Recently I tried a Crystal which seems a little less sharp, but a smoother and burn free shave, where both Astras and Merkurs seemed a little harsher on my neck</li>
    <li> Sharp and a good price.</li>
    <li> These are great blades. I get a smooth shave, and they&#x27;re inexpensive enough to enable me to toss them after a few days. A real joy to use, and a great money saver.</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome. I just recently got into the double-edge razor world, and have been using the few packs of razors that came with my (albeit cheap) handle. And I gotta say, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with my first couple weeks of shaving with this style of razor. There was a lot of pulling, and a little irritation. But I decided to tough it out and see if it got better, as i know several people who swear by the double-edge method. So i bought these blades when I ran out of the supplied ones, and it made a WORLD of difference. These must just be way sharper than the ones I was using, because it shaves as smooth as silk with these. No pulling, no irritation, just a clean swipe and the hair is gone. I will definitely be using these from now on.</li>
    <li> Blades are great for shaving</li>
    <li> I bought these blade for my safety razor and I love them. I can get 3-4 days of use out of one blade (tip, put the head of the razor in a cup of baby oil and your blades will stay sharper a lot longer). At this rate of 1 blade a week, 100 blades will last me 2 years. cant beat that!</li>
    <li> These are OK, they are not as sharp as other blades.  I can only use them once and after that it&#x27;s not the same shave you get like you do when you use it the first time.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Turns out this is a lifetime supply. I&#x27;m on the second blade in almost a year. Long lasting these.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just perfect. A great price too.</li>
    <li> The price is the selling point.  And they do a decent job.</li>
    <li> It provides a VERY close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just what I was looking for and not easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
    <li> These have been great. The local store generic blades cost far more and always cut like old used blades. No problems with these and for the price I can use a new blade every other shave and still not run out in a year.</li>
    <li> Great value. I find them comparable to the Wilkinsons that I&#x27;ve been using happily for years.</li>
    <li> These razors give a great close shave for several uses, and don&#x27;t cost $2-3 dollars each. No rusting after using, quality stainless.</li>
    <li> I bought this 100 pack after having tried Astra Superior Platinum in a blade sampler pack.  The blades are sharp enough to take care of my stubble.  They&#x27;re smooth enough to keep my face from getting irritated.  They&#x27;re forgiving enough that I don&#x27;t nick myself with them.  Judging by performance alone, they&#x27;d be one of my favorite blades.  Add in the low price, and they&#x27;re definitely a winner!</li>
    <li> Astra blades are a fantastic price for a years worth of blades! They give a nice smooth shave without razor burn. I have sensitive skin and it is easily irritated, Astras and Derbys seem to give me the best shave with the least irritation.</li>
    <li> This blade should be a standard in your shaving box. I would not consider it a multi use blade. Shave once then get a new blade. At this price your face deserves a fresh blade everyday! No drama with these blades. They are not insanely sharp to cause hesitation for an untrained hand. Use them with confidence. I enjoy them. Shaving is now something I looked forward to everyday. It is a treat.</li>
    <li> Sharp enough, smooth shave, and great price.</li>
    <li> I got into DE shaving into save some cash and heard how much better it was. Bought these razors from all the good reviews. Definitely better than the sharks that come with your safety razor and its forgiving enough for a noob when shaving to get a good shave and not cut your face up. Haven&#x27;t tried any others but the sharks and Astra&#x27;s are way better.</li>
    <li> I love these blades!  They are extremely sharp while not feeling harsh on my face.  They are also an extraordinary value.  I&#x27;ve tried many blades, and these hit the right combination of price and performance.  They are not quite as sharp as some of the top end blades, like Feathers, but to me, they also weren&#x27;t as harsh on my face.  I wouldn&#x27;t even consider buying feathers over these at the price premium feathers go for.  These Astra Superior Premium Platinums are just that good.</li>
    <li> Tried many different blades, finally settled on a routine of Proraso pre-shave cream, shaving soaps (a variety), Astra blades, and Thayer&#x27;s witch-hazel toner to finish. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 100 pack about two months ago, and I am still on my first razor. Granted, I don&#x27;t grow a thick beard and shave maybe twice or three times a week; nonetheless, this pack of 100 will last me over a decade. And it was only 10 bucks! No more expensive Gillettes or Shicks.</li>
    <li> The razors fir great and you can&#x27;t beat the price of the razors. They look like they will last a long time each.</li>
    <li> Never, ever, will I go back to any other razor.  Having a safety razor provides the best shave I could ask for.  These blades?  Forget about it!  Nothing beats them.  Not only do Russians do vodka and intimidation well.  But they also craft a fine shaving blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done!</li>
    <li> Used these for a merkur 34c as well as a parker shavette razor (break them in half) they were worlds better than the included SHARK blades that bad boy came with.</li>
    <li> I just got my Astra blades and Merkur razor today. I have never used the safety razor. I used it as soon as I opened it. Awesome smooth shave, and no nicks. I recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> What can i say. This is a great blade. I have sensitive skin and thick hard hairs like wires lol and this blade just glided through my skin smoothly and very comfortable.No cuts or razor Burn . Just a very close comfortable shave. I might add used this blade with a feather razor. havent even used the feather blades that came with it lol with this closeness and comfort i dont need to. This is all the blade i need to get a close comfortable shave. And at this price saving tons of money its a beautiful thing. ive used only one other blade Wilkinson sword that was good also but gave more irritation. I highly rexommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great Razor Blades, Great Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was a little bit confusing at first, but after I figured it out I have to say its quite intuitive. The razor blades come in packs of 5 inside this box and have a slit in them to deposit used blades for safe disposal. The blades are even numbered to let you remind yourself how many blades are remaining in the package.</li>
    <li> cutting myself has never been easier.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite blades to use. The only ones I&#x27;ve found that give a nice close shave but are also comfortable to use even after 2 weeks of growth. They don&#x27;t drag or pull the hair out - they just cut right through.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different blades in years of DE shaving. I found Astra SP blades a couple years ago, but kept trying other blades until getting so mired in blades, I stopped wet shaving. I missed DE shaving that I gave some thought to my best and most enjoyable shaves: Gillette Tech with Astra SP blades. I ordered 100 blades, loaded the Tech, and for the past several weeks of daily shaves, I&#x27;ve had no cuts, no razor burn, and no ingrown stubble; but I have had the three to four weeks of the best shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades shave close, but without the irritation of Feather, Med Preps, Super Iridium, Gillette Silver Blues, just to name a few of the blades that wrecked havoc with my skin. Astra SPs, a Gillette Tech, Arko shave stick, and a good boar or badger brush  have delivered consistently smooth and close shaves. I have 300+ Astra&#x27;s &#x27;on file&#x27;, and will likely order a couple hundred more--it&#x27;s the only blade I&#x27;ll use. I&#x27;ve given some five-blade tucks to fellow wet shavers who have become Astra SP users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the SP to Astra Platinum: The SP is much more comfortable against one&#x27;s skin, it doesn&#x27;t scrape, but it does cleave 24-hour stubble with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a close shaving mild razor, but I also want a DFS when I&#x27;m done; and the Tech with Astra SPs deliver. I use one blade for three exceptional shaves. This blade will go five-plus shaves; but I just begin to feel the blade degrading when I&#x27;ve tried a 4th shave. However, the blade will deliver five to six shaves, albeit with some degradation. Shaves two and three may be even better than shave one with a fresh blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades have a little was on them. I dip a fresh blade in a wide-mouth container of alcohol and using my thumb and index fiber on either side of the blade, wipe the wax off before loading. Alcohol softens the wax, making it easy to wipe off before loading, if you&#x27;re so inclined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my a.m. lineup: 1973 Tech, Astra SP, Semogue1438 (boar) Brush, Arkoshave soap, and my post-shave splash is Thayers Cucumber with Aloe witch hazel. The result is an inexpensive but exceptionally fine shave. Blades, soap, and witch hazel cost me about $40 a year. I&#x27;ve had many expensive razors, including Merkur&#x27;s Progress, Slant, 34HD, 34C, 1904, 180 Long Handle, and Futur, and a Feather AS -D1; but nothing is comparable to the setup I&#x27;ve been using. Techs are inexpensive, but efficient and comfortable, even on sensitive skin and wire-like stubble. Astra SP blades are a value; and I&#x27;d use them at twice the price.</li>
    <li> So far in the world of DE Safety Razor shaving I&#x27;ve used Merkur, Feather, and now Astra blades. Astra is #1 at this point, but I do plan on trying others. Merkur blades simply wouldn&#x27;t get me close enough and dulled after one shave. Feather blades made hamburger of my face. The astra blades was simply shocking! I got an amazingly close shave with very few nicks (my fault, not the blade). We&#x27;ll see how the sample pack of blades I got goes, but this blade is definitely high on my list. Worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found your perfect shave yet...</li>
    <li> Most people who use these blades do so for a reason; they are great. The only downside is the adhesive used to keep the paper on the the blades. It takes a bit to clean it off and can be cumbersome.</li>
    <li> Was delivered as advertised - really reasonable</li>
    <li> Cannot beat this deal.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite DE blade after trying out the sampler pack.  I loved it so much that I purchased the 100 pack.  I shave both face and head and this blade is very sharp and smooth.  The only negative is the glue spots but it can be easily removed with hot water which is a very minor inconvenience.  All in all, the ASTRA SP is the DE blade with the best value.  I continue to experiment with other DE blades but I always come back to the ASTRA SP.</li>
    <li> These are the workhorse razor blade for me. They are sharp...not as sharp as a feather, but they are smoother in my opinion. Not to mention they are much more affordable. Works well in mild to medium razors. You can use them in an aggressive razor but just be careful on pressure.</li>
    <li> Great blades! Arrived fast!</li>
    <li> work perfect so much cheaper than gillet</li>
    <li> These double edge razor blades are a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the blades.  All in all a great value!</li>
    <li> Great value.  If I wanted to, I could use a new blade every single shave and still come out money ahead versus my old Fusion razor.  As it is, I can get about 3-4 shaves, just shaving my neck around the beard, so probably 2 shaves full-face.  Recommended if you&#x27;re just getting started shaving with a double edge razor, as they aren&#x27;t overly sharp, but they do the job just fine.</li>
    <li> So far the best shave I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Cheap and sharp. My beard is like wire.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as promised. It is embarrassingly cheaper  to use than any of the modern &amp;#34;mach turbo extreme&amp;#34; plastic chinsey razors. Must be paired with a good shaving cream. There is no school like the old school.</li>
    <li> This razor feels so smoothed on my skin. Unlike Dorco I had no bumps after shaving</li>
    <li> This is an amazing price on a huge pack of blades. They are super thin and they fit my Shaveology razor just fine. It seems they may have some slight overhang, but it has not impacted performance in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my legs and underarms with them, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between these and the expensive blades on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM still terrified every time I change a blade, but that is with any brand.. I am convinced I will cut my fingers off;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using double edge&#x27;s for the last 8 or 9 years now, and I have to say these are the best blades I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried Merkur, Feathers and Derby&#x27;s mostly. Derby were always my go to, Feathers were excellent but too sharp and Merkur dulled too quick for me. I have a thick beard, and have enjoyed Astra&#x27;s the most. They feel the best balanced between sharpness and longevity. Easy to use, clean shave and such a great price. I&#x27;m now giving these as gifts to friends that I introduce to DE shaving.</li>
    <li> Great razors for the price.  Much cheaper than multiblade rip offs!!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased the variety pack to evaluate all the different brands and this is by far the best.  Yes the Feather is sharper, but cuts me up too much.  This is very sharp, and holds its edge a long time, I can shave about 7 times with a single blade.  Compare that to 2 shaves for the Gillette blades, so do not let know brand names fool you.</li>
    <li> I have only used these and Wilkinson Sword, and the two are comparable to each other, i like both brands</li>
    <li> One blade is all you need dont be fooled by the big name razor companys</li>
    <li> Tried a bunch and these worked best for me. Great blade, however, buy a variety pack first and find the blade best for you.</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount of blades. They last a few shaves depending on your style of beard, but i have used better feeling blades, at least for my style of beard. Overall a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great deal for for quality blades. Highly recommend trying these. Using in Merkur and  two Feather razors. If you are new to safety razors, try a samper pack and make sure these are part of it.</li>
    <li> Hey, they are Astra SP&#x27;s, there isn&#x27;t much to say except they are nice and sharp, and very efficient.</li>
    <li> These blades are so good, they give a smooth shave every time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very difficult for me to find good razors, these razors give me a  comfortable shave, thank you.</li>
    <li> My fiance uses these and no complaints so far and its been months. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been doing the DE shaving for a few months now and have got it down.  I use a homemade oil, a shaving soap from the local store, and a good quality handle and badger brush.  My handle came with these blades and I also bought a 35-blade sample pack that included Bluebird, Gillette, Feather, and a few others.  I have course, thick facial hair and gave each blade type a fair shot (to include this one when I first got my setup).  When I started, I was not a fan of this blade at all but quickly realized it was my technique and all I needed was some practice.  I ended up using all 35 blades (5 of each type at a time) and kept detailed notes about them as I went a long.  The last 5 blades were some of these.  I was a little hesitant but decided to give them another shot and boy was I glad that I did.  I think these blades did as good as the rest of the higher priced blades and actually better than most of them.  I decided on this 100 pack which will get me 200 shaves.</li>
    <li> nice blades, goes well with my merkur safety razor, these will last me FOOORRRREEEEVVVVEEERRR.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades.  years and years worth.</li>
    <li> my go to blade for shaving!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a year and I get a close and clean shave each time. If I shave every day I can get 10-15 days on a single bade.</li>
    <li> I think I bought a 2-year supply and didn&#x27;t realize it! I recently look up wet shavings after using an electric for years. But I have long been an aficionado of knives and sharp things, so I know the value of an extremely sharp blade. These blades seem to be well made with just the right amount of temper. They bend appropriately when I tighten down the handle and they sit perfectly in the razor. I don&#x27;t have a really thick beard except for my goatee area. It&#x27;s otherwise patchy. I can get about 2 weeks of shaving per blade! That means I will only be paying about $5/year for blades. Beat that, Dollar Shave Club! If you have a super thick beard, you might not be able to use them as long. These are packed individually wrapped in a small box of 5 and 20 boxes to a sleeve.</li>
    <li> These blades provide a nice smooth shave! I&#x27;d definitely recommend getting these if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving. Got with my merkur 38chd perfect combination</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and excellent blades.</li>
    <li> I experimented with very many of the blades offered on Amazon and ultimately settled on this brand for its sharpness, as well as its kindness to my face - no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after nostalgically having returned to d.e. shaving, I developed an intractable area of ingrowing whiskers on one area of my neck which my wife has had to assiduously keep after with individual plucking with her tweezers.  I&#x27;ve yet to resolve this problem, as the area keeps getting beset with more ingrowing hairs (very irritating).  Thus, I have reluctantly returned to modern, expensive, disposable multi-bladed razors (Schick is my favorite brand), whilst retaining the preliminary brush and cream technique.  There is a reason why technological advances have their place -  never had above problem before nor since returning to the modern era of shaving, with which I do get the most comfortable and closest shaves available.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades thinking in mind that they would save me money in the long run, and in that sense I doubt they will fail me there. However, I was also thinking they would be much better quality compared to the Derby blades I have been using, which cost about the same, maybe a little less. Unfortunately, I am disappointed with the quality of these blades. The first shave is very smooth, better than the Derby blades, but after that it seems like I&#x27;m shaving with a very cheap pocket knife. I was hoping these blades would last me at least three good shaves, but I find myself changing them after two. My next purchase will be a pack of Derby blades.</li>
    <li> After trying a few variety packs of different razors I settled on these.  Consistent blade edges, fairly sharp, very well priced.  Others were either dull (causing tugging when shaving) or had nicks in the blades occasionally (causing cuts).  Some more expensive brands worked well too, but not at this price.</li>
    <li> These are great blades. Very sharp and smooth with no tugging. The blades were delivered on time and $10 or less for 100 blades is a great deal! I highly recommend these blades for any wetshaver.</li>
    <li> The product arrived super-fast and was exactly as advertised. I will do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> The blades pull, drag, and irritate my neck. I have used many other brands without complaint. Astra blades are CHEAP, not inexpensive. Avoid Astra Blades.</li>
    <li> really good durable fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very good razors at a great price. Good bang for your buck. They are sharp and last several shaves. Only problem is the glue you have to wash off be for use. However this is not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> They are not THE smoothest or sharpest blades on the market.  However, they are a good compromise of price and performance.  At the price of $8/100 they are a bargain.  The sharpest most comfortable blades cost upwards of $30/100 plus shipping. When coupled with a vintage Gillette razor and a good quality English or Italian shave soap or cream I can get a weeks worth of close comfortable shaves.  In my opinion, they are a better blade than the Derby blades which are not as sharp or smooth. Your experience may be different. Razors and razor blades are very subjective.</li>
    <li> Blade was blunt after second pass. However I do have a rough/wiry beard, so had to find a sharper blade ( Feather, Personna blue and Gillette Sharpedge seem to work for me). I rate sharpness a touch better than derby.</li>
    <li> I first tried this blade some time ago, from a small sampler.  I hated it.  It was rough, ragged, and cut me up good.  But, based on all the outstanding reviews, I gave it another try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  A pre-shave of olive oil, lathered with Williams, put this blade into a 1968 Knack and the result was one of closest, irritation-free shaves I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  It felt, at times, as if there were no blade at all in the razor.  Very little feedback.  This blade just cuts smooth, however you work it.  It&#x27;s quite sharp, so use it in a mild razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the first time I tried it the blade was damaged, or if the QC from the factory is spotty, but at the price you can afford to ditch the occasion bad one.  This can deliver an absolutely outstanding smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me. I hope they work as well for everyone else.  Great blades, smoother shave than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> TThese are very good blades and especially for the price.  But they don&#x27;t have a place to store the used blades. It is just a little cardboard box that doesn&#x27;t close very well after being opened.  Derby is better and feather is best.</li>
    <li> These are among the best razors I have used, and while they may not be as fine as Feather razors they certainly provide a fantastic everyday close shave</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to recommend one type of blade, as each razor, blade, and face is completely different. That said, if you find that Astra blades are right for you, this is a fantastic deal. I shave every other day and get 2/3 shaves out of each blade. This pack is easily enough to last me an entire year. That&#x27;s dirt cheap.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for high quality razors. I discard them after 2 or 3 uses. No more buying expensive 5-blade disposables for me! I tested these with a Merkur and Edwin Jagger DE Safety Razor and works well in both. Just remember to TAKE YOUR TIME so you don&#x27;t cut yourself. There is a bit of wax on a new razor which can be easily wiped off and doesn&#x27;t affect performance. Have a nice shave!</li>
    <li> I bought these blades for my work and I&#x27;m very satisfied, I suggest this product to all are interested. It&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Astra is a best buy for wet shavers !  They are sharp and clean cutting. So get some and give them try them out.</li>
    <li> Well U Get What U Pay for and yeah listen to the reviews about the glue on the blades such a pain in the ass and these are dull like a good razor used a 4 times the razor that came with my merkur was so much sharper than these half ass razors but again 100 of them for 10 bucks if ur trying to save money get them 1 razor last tops 2-3 shaves each but u have to take the glue of the edge of blade in  order to shave</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really good, especially for the price.  They&#x27;re not great.  A little weird... but it seems like only one side is the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; side to shave with when using these blades (and that side isn&#x27;t always the same side).  So, if I feel the blades tugging, I just flip them upside down and then they work.  In case anyone else has the same problems.</li>
    <li> The quality sucks. Doesn&#x27;t do its job. Had to thrash them. Guys, please do not but this product. Not sharp enough. 3 stars for the price.</li>
    <li> Great razors. They are sharp and have a long life. Buying this 100 pack is a good economical choice as they will last you a long time. I have not tried other razor blades but I see no need to, if my 100 pack runs out before the end of my natural life time I will simply buy Astra again.</li>
    <li> Good quality blades. Edge holds for a good week.</li>
    <li> great value for price. 100 blades should last me atleast the year. Much cheaper then your typical over the counter razor</li>
    <li> this razor reminds me of my last Derby razors. The price is terrific on a box of 100. Can&#x27;t go wrong there compared to cartridge razors. Each blade is lasting me 4 or 5 shaves. You flip the blade after two uses (double edged).</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Quality of shave is not as good as other blades, like Wilkinson or Feather.  I gave the Astra blades a try based on the very positive reviews.  Although many have reported good results, I found that the Astra blades require a little more pressure than other blades I am used to.  The result was a still a somewhat comfortable shave, but the closeness of the shave was lacking.  Perhaps with more experience these blades will grow on me, but for now, I don&#x27;t care for them even though they are quite economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update...tried the blades a few more times.  No improvement in quality of shave noted.  For me, these blades just aren&#x27;t for me.  Lots of great reviews on these, but I didn&#x27;t get good results.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money, gives me a very close shaves. Am very pleased and will reorder these blades again.</li>
    <li> Great razors!  As a barber for over 15 years, these razors have been the best by far. I highly recommend these razors to anyone that is a barber or anyone looking for a smooth clean shave.</li>
    <li> Work great, very satisfy great price</li>
    <li> If you shave with a safety razor, these are the blades to have. If you&#x27;re just starting out, don&#x27;t buy one of those silly blade sampler packs, just get about 15 boxes of these and never buy blades again for as long as you live. Astra SP blades hold an edge well, and they give you a great shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> The blades are a good quality and sharp enough for two or three shaves depending on the beard.</li>
    <li> Great blades for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Love them!!!! No burn totally smooth!!!</li>
    <li> I get a good shave &amp; it last as long as my Gilette&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> not happy with the shave,so they sit in the closet</li>
    <li> Great blades! Very close shave my only complaint is that they go dull faster then the Gillette blades I used to use.</li>
    <li> First razor blades I have ever used.  They are very sharp.  Takes a little practice to shave without cutting yourself.  I like the blades, but I will purchase a variety pack next, to test other blades.</li>
    <li> These fit my safety razor beautifully. They give a decent shave even when I&#x27;m in a hurry and do little prep. I suggest buying a smaller pack to test them out. Buying this many at a time allows me to not worry about razors for quite some time.</li>
    <li> These work VERY well.</li>
    <li> I bought these after having used Merkur brand blades. These were a terrible waste of money and I still have 98 of them in my bathroom. They don&#x27;t shave nearly as well as Merkur brand; I had to shave the same area several times, and even then, my legs weren&#x27;t completely smooth (And this is after just a few days of not having shaved.). I went back to Merkur and will never look back.</li>
    <li> These are every bit as good as Wilkinson blades. The packaging may not be as good as Wilkinson or the old Gillette Platinum, but for this price I&#x27;m ok with that. I get a smooth shave from these blades for 5-6 shaves before they start dropping off noticeably. I have a very heavy beard and have been shaving for over 50 years with a double edge razor so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try them - you won&#x27;t be sorry and the price is great.</li>
    <li> First 2 boxes very sharp close shave right after 3 box every blade is not sharp cut ur skin and no close shave.</li>
    <li> Lots of blades and a good shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never need to buy a shaver again.</li>
    <li> ASTRA SP blades,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are well made and come in the medium range of sharpness, there are sharper blades, and that is not a bad thing. In fact its a very good thing because you don&#x27;t always have to have the very sharpest blade to get the job done. There are other factors to consider as well like smoothness, skin feel, edge retention, cost, availability, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are not really the best at any one category, but they are very good in all categories. They are smooth, well made, consistent quality, easy to learn with, forgiving of mistakes in your technique, and thus they are a favorite blade for many DE shavers. I have been DE shaving for five months and have used many different blades. I now mainly use Feather blades, but I bought these as my secondary blade because I enjoy using them. They are very good shaving blades. They produce baby&#x27;s butt smooth shaves with my favorite Gillette Super Speed razors and that makes them worthy of being in my daily shave rotation. They are just the thing to use when your skin is a bit irritated or sun/wind burned. They are easy on the skin, sharp enough to take off the whiskers, and darned cheap to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally get five or more shaves per blade from them and have used them over 15 times in a vintage Gillette Tech razor. But that takes time to develop the skills necessary to accomplish that many shaves from one blade. Since changing over from Cartridge razors my face and beard have never been as happy. If your thinking of switching to DE razors do it!!&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little while to learn how to shave with DE razors and blades, but once you do your face will look and feel so much better. I used to never be able to shave everyday due to irritation and ingrown hair, but now I shave everyday and I have had NO  ingrown hair at all. My face looks and feels ten years younger and I get compliments often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So try DE shaving and don&#x27;t forget to get some Astra SP blades! They are worth the price and perform like blades that cost twice as much.e worth the price and perform like blades that cost twice as much.</li>
    <li> They are not very good blades. I bought these to shave my eyebrows and was disappointed. If you&#x27;re looking to cut fabrics these will do. I feel as if I wasted my money though.</li>
    <li> These are razor blades.  Now, I know that they may seem complicated but if you are willing to give it the time, they are worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I have a very chiseled face.  Many edges that make shaving difficult.  Toss one of these into my ol&#x27; safety razor and together - they glide smoothly over my face - leaving it, well, smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had the opportunity to use one to peel off some gunk from the windshield of my car - spectacular!&lt;br /&gt;So versatile in many applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please do not use if you are sad or depressed.</li>
    <li> Good DE blades that last more than 3 to 4 shaves. Find these blades to shave better than the Wilkinson Sword blades. The only issue I have is the sticky, residual adhesive that stay on the blade after removing the wax wrap.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razor blades.  Very sharp, very smooth, very comfortable.  Ordering in bulk like this is a great way to save even more money.  I only need to order a box like this about once a year.  If you are into classic double edge shaving, this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I am a dedicated Feather user, however these are really quite good and the price is just unbeatable. Perhaps I get 2 or 3 fewer shaves with these, but that is fine. A great value in the DE world.</li>
    <li> I like the feather ones better, but these are not bad especially since they are only 1/4 the cost of the others.  I dont get as many shaves out of these but they are better than some I have used.  for the money they work well.</li>
    <li> Not all blades are meant for all people, you really need to do a lot of testing on different blades before you figure out which works best for your dexterity, skin, and facial hair.  That being said if Astras work well for you, then this is a great value buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 10 blades I&#x27;ve used in this package, I had one defect blade that was pretty bad at shaving, I thought I was just having a really off day but I changed the blade mid shave and it all worked again.</li>
    <li> I really like the Astra Blades, they are cheap and they are easy to control. But it really does all depend on your skin type. Make sure you try a sample pack of blades before you go and spend money on getting a ton of one blade. I have numerous friends that all shave with DE razors and each one uses a different brand of blades.</li>
    <li> Astra Razors are great! This box probably could last for three years.&lt;br /&gt;After switching to double edge razors, the cost of shaving has drastically been reduced. You definitely need to be careful when handling this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Very sharp edges&lt;br /&gt;+Great price&lt;br /&gt;+zero rust&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;+none so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to a friend?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is great item and works very well</li>
    <li> I have just recently started wet DE shaving a few months ago. The Derby Extras I originally bought always pulled and tugged and cut my face to pieces. These Astra blades are super sharp and give me a clean shave with no burn or nicks. I&#x27;ll stick with Astra from now on.</li>
    <li> These are the only blades I have tried so I will update when I try more blade to compare it to, but for the last month they have served me great!  No complaints. They come in little paper boxes of 5 blades each. Not really certain to say, but they work for me and are plenty cheap.  I am not careful about which side of the blade I use each day and use a new one each week.</li>
    <li> I love these razors and will keep buying them. Can&#x27;t beat the cost savings over expensive &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; razors from the store.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this 100 pack of blades. I&#x27;ve found the Astra SP blade to be the best value available. Very inexpensive and an excellent shave. There may be better blades out there, but I stopped looking after I found this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had sharper blades but these are ok.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these. He says they have a good edge and can get a good 5-6 shavings out of them before he has to change them. WIll buy them again once we go through this whole box of 100, which could take awhile. Price was on point as well.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the price. My husband is pleased with his clean close shave!</li>
    <li> I mean, they are razor blades.  They are sharp and noting more</li>
    <li> Perfect. Yup. I&#x27;ll be getting this again.</li>
    <li> Great Buy! Great Blades!! So much cheaper than the expensive Mach whatever&#x27;s but not cheaply made. Good sturdy blades.</li>
    <li> With all the 5-star reviews, mine is probably unnecessary, but - I bought the Voberry DE razor, which I am very satisfied with (delivered price under $4!) but the included blade was horrible - I got these and shaves are as smooth as any multi-blade disposable out there. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> These blades are great!!! A one year supply of these is less than the price of one, individual, single, cartridge for my old razor. They cut very smoothly, and don&#x27;t bounce across the skin like other brands.</li>
    <li> Sharp,smooth,very consist edge.its my everyday blade, lasts abought 2 sharp pull free shaves</li>
    <li> Great blades!  Great price!</li>
    <li> Sharp blade at affordable price. Very smooth and can last 3-5 shaves.</li>
    <li> There are 100 on the package, and I&#x27;m still on the first one! Super good quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to the wet shave, but jumped all in.  I started with a Merkur Futur safety razor as I wanted to be able to adjust the blade exposure due to my sensitive skin.  The Merkur blades that came with it always seemed to irritate my skin and I felt that it was my technique that was at fault.  After reading several reviews on multiple blades, I gave Astra a try and have been thrilled with the results.  My facial hair is medium to light and this is a very smooth blade and no irritation.  At about $0.10 a blade, you really cannot beat the price.  This box will last me a year plus.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price.</li>
    <li> these are extremely cheap per unit, but they aren&#x27;t as sharp as any of the brands from Japan and there is a lot of adhesive left on the metal from the paper wrapping.  All in all, not bad but not great.</li>
    <li> These blades definitely get the job done, but they aren&#x27;t necessarily good.  They&#x27;re pretty blunt for safety razors and don&#x27;t last more than 1 MAYBE 2 shaves each.  If you&#x27;re looking to save money, buy these.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good shave, go to the Feather razor blades.</li>
    <li> I love these blades! Super smooth with my Edwin Jagger DE89.  I don&#x27;t need anything more agressive in my life!</li>
    <li> I bought the 100 pack blind, not having tested them with any of the sample packs. I had tried derby and shark and a couple of others and found them all mediocre - they gave me a rough but not particularly close shave. I bought the astras on a whim based on ratings here and the price was hard to argue with. So far I am a week on the first blade and it is still amazingly smooth and sharp. Maybe it just fits my razor (Parker 22R) better than the others, but at this rate I&#x27;ve got excellent blades to last a couple of years or more at a little over 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> I went through a sampler of various kinds of blades and eventually settled on Astras. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so I really recommend a sampler pack to decide upon your razor of choice. For me Astra blades are a smooth shave, not too sharp and not too dull. Perfect for me.</li>
    <li> For the price, well worth it. I shave my head and face, every day, sometimes twice. A blade a day is about what I go through, so I know these babies well. I use a bit of cocoa butter on the skin before applying shaving cream (try it), and these blades are plenty sharp, so I often don&#x27;t need 2 rounds of shaving. I mean I do it anyway, for that cleanest clean, but these blades do the job quite well the first time around. Tough, curly hair here, so I need sharp. These are sharp and plentiful.</li>
    <li> These blades work perfectly for me, seems to be the right balance of sharpness, flexibility, and durability. I highly recommend these blades to anyone getting started with DE safety razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using DE razor for a few months and I&#x27;m checking out new blades.  The are my least favorite of the brands I&#x27;ve tried, behind Derby, Shark, and Feather.  No cuts but needed several passes to the point of razor burn.  Used with a Merkur closed comb, barber pole, silvertip badger brush, high end shaving oil, and Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> When I first started using a double-edged safety razor over a year ago, I got a sampler pack to find out which ones would be good for my beard.  The Astra Platinum&#x27;s were among the best.  They&#x27;re not as sharp as Feather but they are very \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;.  Not sure if that is correct lingo in shaving terms but these razors just seem smooth when I&#x27;m using them.  For me they&#x27;ll last 4 - 6 shaves each.  This 100 pack for the price can&#x27;t be beat - it will probably last me for 2 years.  Really a great deal!</li>
    <li> This blade is a good blade.  No doubt.  Out of the 6 or so I&#x27;ve tried, they were all good blades.  Out of all the good blades, this was my least favorite sadly.  I am a fan of feathers and derbys.  The feathers are a little too sharp for me if I&#x27;m not careful I can get shave rash.  The derbys are just right, and fairly cheap.  But again.  This is a good blade too, ever de blade I&#x27;ve tried has been better than a mach 3 razor for me in terms of use.  I love DE!</li>
    <li> I like these better because It lasts an entire shave and comes in a wax paper that seems to store better.</li>
    <li> I have used them in Jagger, Gillette Slim, Senator, Tech, Red Tip, SS, etc and it usually is in the top 3 blades. I have tested Feather, NOS feather from 1980, Merkur, Personna, derby, and shark. This is one of my go to blades when I test a new razor as it always gives a smooth fine shave. Bought 100 and plan to buy a lot more.</li>
    <li> These were the first DE blades I bought. I have no complaints with their quality, but I do need to practice a bit more.</li>
    <li> Solid low-priced blades for new DE shavers. If you&#x27;re willing to pay almost double ($0.17/blade rather than $0.10) you can get some good lower-mid priced Israeli Personna blades (rebranded as Crystal I believe) that I find much smoother.</li>
    <li> I had just started with DE shaving and saw the price on this and couldn&#x27;t pass them up. They are very good blades I get a whole week out of the blade and I shave everyday. 7 days out of a blade is a lot. I will defiantly buy again</li>
    <li> These are good sharp blades.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different blades and these are both sharp and smooth - a rare combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Sharp, smooth, cheap&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  GLUE, only two good shaves, cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if the reason these blades are so cheap might be because they are factory seconds or rejects - the reason being THE GLUE.  A bit of blade glue, although unnecessary, doesn&#x27;t usually bother me.  However these blades have ALOT of glue (waxy adhesive that fixes them to the wrapper) - so much so that the glue-dot actually spreads to the cutting edge of the blade on most of the blades I have used.  It doesn&#x27;t really seem to effect the shave much, but it still bothers me.  In my mind the blade edge should be clean and clear, and these are not.  It also causes the blade to stick ever so slightly in my razors and it leaves some of the waxy adhesive behind in the razor and does not rinse right off.&lt;br /&gt;Also I find these blades are only good for a couple of shaves.  Keeping in mind that I have relatively sensitive skin and I almost never use a blade more than three times, so two shaves isn&#x27;t bad - especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;That said, these are definitely top notch blades and you shouldn&#x27;t feel bad tossing them after a couple of nice shaves.  The glue is annoying but for the price even that can be forgiven.  Four stars for price and performance.  One star deducted for the unnecessary adhesive.</li>
    <li> These blades are pretty good and get the job done. They&#x27;re cheap enough that I can use new ones after every other shave. On the third shave they&#x27;re already dull.</li>
    <li> After I had used the Blue Bird and Astra blades for the first time, I made the mistake of rating the Blue Bird better for me than the Astra. I must have had a good Blue Bird or a bad Astra, because it hasn&#x27;t worked that way for me since. The Astras are sharp and smooth cutting. They&#x27;re the best blades that I have used and I believe I&#x27;ll stick with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whiskers on my neck seem to grow in about 6 directions, so I have a hard time getting a close shave on the neck without causing razor burn from going over them with the razor so much. I&#x27;ve thought of going back to my electric with shaving cream, but the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close. Using the Astra blade with a shaving oil under the shaving soap I do get a good, non painful shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize everyone&#x27;s face is somewhat different. If you&#x27;re one of the lucky ones whose whiskers all grow in one direction, a lot of different blades likely work well for you. For me, I think it&#x27;ll be Astra blades--especially given the great price you can buy them for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These blades do not work for me at all!  Try a derby or a feather; they are definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, we&#x27;re being conditioned to pay 3-5 dollars for a cartridge to shave with that doesn&#x27;t last any longer than one of these blades. At about 11 cents each it seems almost too good to be true-- but it is!  I&#x27;ve used about 10 of the blades in the box now and haven&#x27;t run across a bad one yet.  Now, when I go to the shaving aisle at Wal-Mart and see what the other poor slobs are having to pay to get a decent shave I really feel sorry for them.  Spread the word-- whether you use these blades or have another favorite there&#x27;s no sense wasting your money just because the big shaving products companies say you should.  And with all the money you save using these blades you can give yourself a good shave and take your special someone out to eat somewhere nice (well, at least to Sonic...).  Great blades at a great price!</li>
    <li> This was the greatest deal! I have shaved with ten, fifteen types of razor blades, and I ended up liking these Astras over the Feather blades a little bit. This deal was incredible, and I am set for a while now!</li>
    <li> These blades work well for me ,they give me a nice clean shave and very few nick&#x27;s to your skin.</li>
    <li> The price is great, the amount in the box is great, but when I use it on my very sensitive skin, it feels like grinding my face against a gravel driveway. It is NOT sharp enough to give a tough beard on sensitive skin a smooth shave. It WILL cut, bleed, and discourage you from getting a complete shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going for the Feathers: sharper, but less passes.</li>
    <li> I used Japanese Feather blades exclusively for a long time, but I didn&#x27;t like the high cost (still much cheaper than those ridiculous cartridges, but expensive nonetheless).  So I did a bit of research and read a lot of good reviews about these Astras.  These are now my favorite blades:  cheap, sharp, and comfortable.  As for how many shaves you get out of them, that depends on you.  I don&#x27;t wait until DE blades get dull; there&#x27;s no point.  I use them for three shaves and then toss them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, PLEASE do not throw old DE blades directly into the trash!  Get a blade bank or put them into any kind of closed container before you throw them away.  I recommend getting a cheap blade bank or piggy bank or even a used food container that has a closing lid.  It will take a LONG time to fill a container with these blades, but when you do (after a year or longer), seal it up with tape before throwing away.</li>
    <li> After working my way through many blades I liked(Personna red pk. and med prep,Wilkenson,Shark,ending with a 100 blade bulk order for BlueBirds) and some blades I DISLIKED(Feather,Merkur &amp; Derby) over the last two years Astra has become my go-to blade.  For the last 6 months I&#x27;ve happily used BlueBirds and decided to try the Astra&#x27;s on the advice of a friend, because I had some left from a sample pk and kept hearing good things about them on the shave forums.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that there is a \\&quot;GIANT\\&quot; difference between the two. However for me the Astra&#x27;s outperform the BlueBirds by a small margin in everyway(sharpness,closeness,smoothness and lack of irritation) and when you factor in the cost difference, the Astra&#x27;s are a hands down winner! I would recommend trying Astra blades to anyone.</li>
    <li> Year 2012 has been a double edged safety razor journey for me. I have tried the following razors blades: Merkur, Feather, Astra and Derby. None of them gave me as comfortable of a shave as the Astra. Using a Merkur 23C or an EJ89 razor I get fantastic shaves with the Astra for about four shaves. I do use pre-shave oil on my face and lather shaving cream to perfection in a bowl. The only blade that I could not tolerate was the Merkur that felt like trying to shave with a wooden stick. For my hair and skin the Derby has acted more dull than the Astra, and I have tried many times. The Feathers are great in the EJ89, but have to be very careful when using it in a more agressive razor like the 23C. For the price of 10 cents a blade I am very satisfied with the Astra SP razor blades.</li>
    <li> These blades are super sharp, and super smooth. They are only surpassed by feather blades for sharpness. They provide the best shaves I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I bought a sampler of DE blades and tried about 13 different brands and styles. I think my favorite was between Feather and Astra, with Feather being slightly better. But being able to get Astra blades in bulk is huge win making them far more economical than Feather, so I bought two bricks of Astra&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course favorite blades are a matter of personal taste. Having said that I would steer clear of Derby blades, also available here in bulk. I found them to be pretty harsh compared to Astra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> These blades are SHARP. If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and with a DE safety razor be careful until you get the hang of it. When you&#x27;re DE wet shaving it&#x27;s all about the angles you approach your face with it.  It just requires practice. I&#x27;ve been DE wet shaving all of my life off and on. I own 3 different DE safety razors and one of them is a old Gillette DE Safety razor that you have to take apart to install a new blade. My other 2 are butterfly openers. I just recently picked up a new DE butterfly open safety razor from Sally Beauty Supply for just under $11.00  And it works the best. Watch out for sellers here or on Ebay that have an inflated price on a DE safety razor. They are all about the same. These blades are NOT for the novice shaver. Take your time with these blades because like I said they are SHARP. I just got these the other day and believe me I have a heavy beard and it went through my beard like hot butter. Talk about a close comfortable shave. It felt like I didn&#x27;t even have any whiskers after I was done. I&#x27;m talking about a close shave. The price here for these blades is righteous too. I mean 100 blades I am sure I will be able to get at least 4 shaves per blade. Here&#x27;s a hint I picked up recently talking to a lady friend of mine. Go out and buy some baby oil. Don&#x27;t matter what brand. Get a Dixie cup and fill it up with just enough oil to cover the head of the shaver and blade. After you get done shaving take the blade out and rinse it well under hot water. Put the blade back into the shaver and put it in the Dixie cup with oil for in between shaves. You will find that it will extend the life of the blade for extra shaves. The oil prevents the blade from rusting. When the blade rusts that is why it gets dull and your shaves become uncomfortable. Works well on disposable blades too. Learn something new every day.</li>
    <li> Superior blades at a great price, I will not use any others.  Does not cut or nick like some other blades.</li>
    <li> I have used two of these blades so far and have been very impressed for the cost to value ratio its a great buy.</li>
    <li> These are my new go-to.  They last multiple shaves and are easy on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive face.  The cheaper blades &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; against my hairs, and leave bumps (razor burn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on a mission to find the best blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far, these are the best.  I was encouraged by the number of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I also read the negatives.  Let me add, none of my razors have ANY writing on the paper.&lt;br /&gt;You can see ASTRA through the thin wrapper, though.  I thought it was printed on the paper&lt;br /&gt;at first, I had to double check.  The paper is blank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This becomes the only blade I want to put to my face!</li>
    <li> The best blades so far.</li>
    <li> i have super ensitive skin and everything from 7 oclock to feathers gave me ingrowns and razor bumps. these dont. i will continue to use these</li>
    <li> OMG i love these! top of the line in all respects. these are hands down the best razors i&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;true to description</li>
    <li> Fit into standard safety razor perfectly. Excellent buy for the price.</li>
    <li> One of the best blades on the market at a great price. I can get up to three shaves from a single blade if needed, but recently I have been using a new blade for every shave. The Astra blades glide and perform as expected.</li>
    <li> After having tried dozens of different varieties of double-edge razor blades, this is my favorite by far. It&#x27;s not the sharpest--that crown goes to Feather--but it is the smoothest, and quite long-lasting with a consistent shave throughout the week. I&#x27;ve even used a single blade for more than two weeks, and it still works well. And obviously the price is great, too.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty tough beard, yet I am still on my 1st blade after 3 months. I clean it after every shave.</li>
    <li> Very nice and smooth shave and long lasting ....waiting to run out</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I have tried these blades in several different razors and came to the same conclusion after shaving with each razor. I prepared my face the same each shave. Used the same shaving soap and shaving brush each shave. I put the Astras in and shaved with my Merkur 23c, Merkur 37c Slant Bar, Gillette 1956 Red Tip, Gillette Fatboy 1961, Gillette Silver Speedtip 1957, Gillette Slimboy 1966 over a several week period&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the blades had a tug to my face upon first using these blades but seem to get better after the 1st initial shave. Almost like the blade needed a break in and then it smoothed out.  I performed a 3 pass shave each time with each razor.&lt;br /&gt;I got maybe 3 shaves from each blade before the blade was making my face raw and had to discard the blade.&lt;br /&gt; I never got a real good close shave with any of the razors using the Astra Blade.  I dialed my Gillette Fatboy up to 9 and still the Astra Blades just didn&#x27;t give that BBS shave like I had gotten with other blades using these exact same razors I listed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this said . Everyone has a different type beard. Some Coarse, Some Fine.&lt;br /&gt;Skin types vary from Sensitive to having Alligator Skin.&lt;br /&gt;Some guys only have to shave a couple times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty coarse beard and medium sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;These blades just didn&#x27;t work that well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a pack of the Astra Blades to a friend of mine to have him test them out and he told me the same thing. He wasn&#x27;t getting the same close smooth shave as he was used to getting from the Feather Double Edge Blades.His beard is not as coarse as mine so it really surprised me when he said they didn&#x27;t perform that well for him. He tried the Astra Blades in 3 different razors. He pretty well mirrored the same results I got shaving with the Astra Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades that have worked SUPER for me are Feather Double Edge Blades !!!&lt;br /&gt;I can get 8 to 10 shaves from a Feather Blade. There is no tugging. Just a clean, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how many reviews I have read where these guys are so scared of Feather Blades.&lt;br /&gt;They tell you you&#x27;ll cut your face up. I haven&#x27;t cut myself using a Feather Blade&lt;br /&gt;You want a Super Sharp Blade when you are shaving other wise the blades is literally pulling the hairs out of your face instead of being sheared off nice and smooth. Think about your lawnmower and cutting your grass. You want that blade sharp so it will cleanly cut the blade of grass instead of yanking it out by the roots and having a crappy looking yard and damaging the lawn.. Well the same goes for Double Edge Razor Blades. You want the sharpest you can get and you will get a BBS shave without tearing your face up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a light beard and don&#x27;t have to shave everyday then maybe these blades will work great for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for my money I buy the Feather Blades. When I factor in how many more shaves I get from a Feather Blade than I did from the Astra Blades I am money ahead to buy the Feathers and I get a much much better shave and don&#x27;t have to change out the blades as often and to me that&#x27;s less wear and tear on my razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many, many different brand blades from dorco, personnas, wilkinson, derbys, merkurs, polsilvers and the list gos on.&lt;br /&gt;The one blade I have decided to stick with is the Feather Blades. The upfront cost is more than a 100 pack of cheap blades but the cost per blade per shave is cheaper with the feather and the shaving experience much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stress enough that this is my experience with the Astra Blades and you may find that they are the best blade you have ever shaved with.  What works for one guy may not work for the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys looking to just start out wet shaving with a Double Edge Razor I would suggest buying a pack of feather blades, and then buy a razor you like. An adjustable razor is great for starting out that way you can get an idea of how aggressive of a razor your face and beard can deal with. Once you find your groove and get comfortable with your razor and are getting a good shave then venture out and buy some different razors. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on a Variety Pack of Razors. 98% of the blades are low quality crap filler blades just to make the variety pack look good like your really getting a deal. Too many guys buy a crappy razor and crappy blades and can&#x27;t figure out why they aren&#x27;t getting a good shave and give up.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the best you can afford and you won&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To wrap this review up I always say.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the best you can afford and you won&#x27;t go wrong and You Get What You Pay For...t way you can get an idea of how aggressive of a razor your face and beard can deal with.

    <li> These are sharper than almost all the other blades I&#x27;ve tried except Feather. The packaging leaves four globs of glue on each blade, which I had to clean off each time I changed blades.</li>
    <li> Blades are great. very smooth</li>
    <li> Yes, as virtually everyone else has said, if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving ... or simply changing over from a single or multi-blade cartridge style razor ... you really need to try one of the variety packs (there are several on Amazon).  Pick one with 5 blades of each type, as you may need to repeatedly shave with one type of blade to determine if it really works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously these Astra blades work really well for me.  One question I see popping up often is the number of shaves per blade.  I use each blade twice - once per side.  I&#x27;m guessing I could go longer, but this way I always have a brand new edge with which to shave - and it&#x27;s easier to keep track of how many times I&#x27;ve used it (important in the early morning for non-morning people).  If I figure that I shave 300 times per year (probably on the high side), I need 150 blades per year.  And at the price here (even without free shipping), I&#x27;m looking right at $2.00 per month to shave.  If I&#x27;m desperate to save $, I&#x27;ll skimp somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I purchased a sample pack of blades and tried Derby, Astra, and Feather, among others.  Derby was great to start with, as they aren&#x27;t quite as sharp and give you a pretty decent shave.  The 5 blades in the sample pack were enough, and as I moved to the Astra blades, I much preferred the Astra blades for shaving.  I gave Feather blades a try, but they seemed to be a little bit too sharp.  Plus they cost about $.50 per blade versus about $.10 per Astra blade.  This pack is going to last me for a while.  Once again, make sure you try various blades, because preference really depends on the person.  Make sure the pack at least includes Derby, Feather, and Astra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when you are first trying DE razors, don&#x27;t spend $30 or more on your first razor.  The Chinese double edge razor, which costs under $10, will give you a very good idea of if you want to shave with a DE. http://www.amazon.com/Silver-Double-Shaver-Nonslip-Handle/dp/B0050HO9MI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361225674&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;double+edge+razor  At the time of writing this, it seems to be about $3.50, I paid like $6.  I still use this razor, and haven&#x27;t felt the need to upgrade.  At worst, you have a travel razor after you decide to buy a more expensive razor.</li>
    <li> I went through a blade sampler pack and decided on these, as I think the majority of people do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just starting out wetshaving, don&#x27;t get this, get the sampler pack. Every person is different, and whats good for the goose is not good for the gander in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, after going through the pack, I found I liked Astra greens (these), Sharks, Feathers, and Bics. I ruled out the Feathers because they are TOO agressive, and I get more nicks and such with them no matter how careful I was. The bic may have been my favorite shave, but blades cost between 50 cents to a dollar a piece, depending on how many you get at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharks were the middle ground, but in the end I chose Astras because they are more easily accessable and cheaper. 7 to 10 cents a blade? With a good, sharp, coated blade? I can get a years worth of shaving AT LEAST for ten dollars. And its not a sacrifice for cash, my shaves are just as good as blades that cost ten times that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have complained about the wax the use to seal the wrapper. This wax is hardly noticeable and will rinse off before you even get a chance to shave, not affecting the blade&#x27;s performance at all. Anyhow, I love them, and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I read reviews about other blades and found these to be generally liked. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in the shave. Great blades mean a very smooth, easy shave, and an even better value.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do much better than Astra blades. They hold a decent edge for at least 4 shaves and even up to 6. It&#x27;s been almost a year since purchase and I haven&#x27;t even depleted half the box, ten of the blades were even given away. You can&#x27;t do better in quality for this price, or even twice the price.</li>
    <li> received these blades and the first one i tried i got five shaves out of it these blades are the best i have used  would reccomend to anyone who uses a double edge reazor</li>
    <li> Over a year of shaving for less than $10. These blades come in cardboard sleeves, so you might want to keep an old Altoids tin to dispose of the old blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A double edge razor shaves much better than those 4 or 6 blade monstrosities. However, you cannot take them through airport security, which is why I also have a 4 blade monstrosity for travel.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I purchased the basic Merkur safety razor and entered a new world of shaving joy. Blades were cheap, I didn&#x27;t cut myself, and no ingrown hairs. I would buy whatever blades Walmart had (usually Wilkinson Swords) because they were cheap and available. Walmart stopped selling them, so I was on the hunt for a new blade. I decided to try these by Astra and they are excellent. They offer an even smoother shave than I had before and so far have been consistently of high quality. Factor in the cost and this is a best buy.</li>
    <li> Much better than Derby.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and long lasting.  I gave up on electric razors - did not shave close enough.  Went &amp;#34;Old school&amp;#34; with the reliable and proven safety razor.  I&#x27;ve been using these blades and they give a very close and comfortable shave.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with these excellent blades.</li>
    <li> Do not keep wasting money on shavers from the store.  This work wonderfully and are much cheaper per blade.</li>
    <li> These, for me, are terrible. Not nearly sharp enough or consistent. I find the Personas and Feathers better for my beard type. Of course YMMV. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought 100 of them. Anyone want to buy the remaining 90? :)</li>
    <li> I got this for my grandpa, but he loves them, so 5 stars! Plus, they aren&#x27;t a bad price, so do it!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, razors are great, get 3-5 shaves per blade. Blades do have glue on four points to adhere to paper wrapping but does not affect performance. Overall awesome deal for price and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> The DE blades vary with each face and preference, but these are the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  Tried a sampler pack, these were about 7-8 brands in and after trying them I immediately ordered a bulk supply since they gave me no razor burn/rash, and minimal, if any, nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> One of the best buys on DE blade out there.</li>
    <li> How can you complain 100 blades for about 10 cents apiece GREAT BUY...</li>
    <li> I bought a test pack of many different brands of double edge razors and tested them all.  I found the Astra Superior Platinum to be the best value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really came to a hard decision between Astra or Feather.  Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package the Feather feels a tiny bit sharper than the Astra, but after a few shaves the Astra held it&#x27;s edge better and felt sharper.  The Feather lasted 6 shaves and the Astra lasted 8 shaves before I had to throw them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Feather wins is marketing and appearance.  It looks cleaner and more classy, but it&#x27;s also more expensive.  The Astra looks average and kind of smells like machine oil (but you usually can&#x27;t tell when you&#x27;re shaving).  I went with the Astra because it holds it&#x27;s edge longer and is cheaper.</li>
    <li> First experience with doubt edge razors. Glad I made the switch! I over use blades and they still work like magic!</li>
    <li> The hair around my chin and neck come out at different angles and the electric razor just wasn&#x27;t getting the job done. So, I switched to double edged razor. I saw some great reviews on Astra blade being perfect for people with my issue. After using them for several months I have to say that they do shave closer than my electric razor, but I can still feel some stubble. I got 3-4 uses from the sample Gillette blades that came with my razor (with the same stubble issue), but with Astra I only get 1-2 uses. Since I bought the 100 pack, which was really cheap, I&#x27;ll keep using them. However, I will probably try another blade next time.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son. He threw them out and went back to disposables.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades so far. I have tried Feather and a few others. This one is the best so far.</li>
    <li> I use these blades with my new EJ De89lbl razor and I can&#x27;t believe how close the shave is.  I do 3 passes WTG, XTG, &amp; ATG and touch up spots on the neck and I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my results are.  Love these blades!  They came well packaged and are very economical to use.  They are sharp but not so sharp that I&#x27;m afraid of looking like I&#x27;m an extra in &amp;#34;The Fight Club&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I enjoy s good blade. Its so sharp that I sometimes cut myself cause I press a little too hard. The glue on the blades from the wax doesn&#x27;t effect the sharpness of the blades.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for about 3 years now and have tried many blades. I have loved feather blades from the beginning for their sharpness and longevity but they can cause irritation as well. These astra blades are plenty sharp but much smoother than feather. The best thing about these blades is the price!</li>
    <li> I have been using Feather blades for months now, but decided to give these a try since they were only $9 for 100 blades. I must say I am very impressed by the quality of these blades. With Feather blades, I tended to give myself razor burn and had me reaching for the alum stick. I have thick, wiry whiskers and these blades cut right through it without being disposed to using too much pressure on the razor. If you like Feather, give these a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for about 6 months now. Recently upgraded from a Merkur HD to a Merkur Progress. I am truly satisfied with the Progress but that is for another review. Now, onto the blades. Astra&#x27;s are the 3rd or 4th razor I&#x27;ve experimented with. I hopped right into the DE hobby using Feather blades at first and subsequently shredded my face. I had no idea what I was doing back then. Now that I have perfected my technique, I know the intricacies of getting a BBS shave all over my face quickly and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Astra blades are decent. I thought they would be my daily blades. They&#x27;re a bit better than Dorco&#x27;s and for the price they are the better choice than those. But I went back to Feather blades now that I perfected my technique. And these just don&#x27;t compare at all to the Feathers. If I had a choice between the two, or a choice between a Feather I have used 3 times already, or a fresh Astra blade. The feather would still give a cleaner less irritating shave on my face. There is a dramatic difference in performance between the two. But there is also a huge difference in the price. You only get 30 feather blades for the price of 100 Astras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get BBS every time with the Feathers. With the Astras I get dragging and irritation. A three pass shave with Astra&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t give me as clean a shave as 2 pass with feathers. Even on 3 day growth I can do a 2 pass with Feathers and get BBS. With Astra, overnight growth needs 3 passes. They just aren&#x27;t sharp enough for me to give me a truly clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a newbie to DE and need to craft your technique I think these would be a good choice before getting something as sharp as the Feathers though. I shaved with these for 2 months before falling in love with Feathers and they helped me get my technique down.</li>
    <li> This is a 5-Star DE blade for me.  As with any DE blade, your mileage WILL vary--you could love them or hate them.  I don&#x27;t recommend buying in bulk until you&#x27;ve tried out some sampler packs and see what works for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried about 3 sampler packs--about 20 different brands.  This included very popular blades such as Derby and Feather.  I personally find these blades to be the perfect balance with regard to sharpness and smoothness.  This is my daily blade and I get about 4-5 shaves out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them in a Merkur M30c, an Edwing Jagger DE89dl, and a short-handle Mergress.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for about five years now. (Gillette Black Beauty Adjustable) Prior to these blades I just used the cheap (quality, not price) drug store blades and the modern Wilkenson Sword blades they sell at my local Wal Mart.  I realize all skin is different, but so far, these Astras are the best razor blades I&#x27;ve ever used.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but they don&#x27;t pull whatsoever and I don&#x27;t end up with razor burn to get a baby-smooth shave.  The price is amazing too.  I&#x27;ll be using a blade every 2-3 shaves and swapping it for a new one from now on.  No sense in using a dulling blade when there are 99 more waiting in the medicine chest and they&#x27;re only $0.10 each.  And as for the little dabs of wax in the blades everybody seems to be complaining about... They&#x27;re barely even noticeable and don&#x27;t affect the shave in the slightest way whatsoever.  They&#x27;re just there to hold the wrapper on, and a short blast of hot water immediately removes them, if you&#x27;re so inclined to to that.  I&#x27;m not.  In short, I have no brand loyalty to any company, but these blades work great for me and the price was fantastic.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy them again in a YEAR when I run out.</li>
    <li> Solid blade, good for 5-6 shaves for me and can&#x27;t beat the price. A solid purchase for safety razor fans.</li>
    <li> I guess this is an example of &amp;#34;What you pay is what you get&amp;#34;. The price was very low, but looks like I will use them up quickly as the get dull quickly. The &amp;#34;title&amp;#34; sounds great, but they don&#x27;t measure up to the claim.</li>
    <li> I snap these in half to use them with my disposable straight shaver, blades are excellent and work for 4-5 shaves before dulling.</li>
    <li> I love these blades and their price, lets hope production doesn&#x27;t stop. I&#x27;ve shaved with many different blades but these are the ones I love the most.</li>
    <li> Pros: cost is less than $0.10 per blade; blades are sharp and smooth and last for 5 - 7 days&lt;br /&gt;Cons: these blades have a tendency to rust slightly after a few days, but the cutting edge does not seem to be affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: these are sharp, smooth blades that last about a week for a great price.  IMO, they are comparable to the Personna med prep blades, although the Personnas last a few days longer and are not prone to rust - but the Personnas are a few cents more per blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for awhile now, and I&#x27;m impressed with the longstanding quality of the shave they yield. I&#x27;ve used feathers, BIC&#x27;s and loads of other blades, but these are the ones that I keep coming back to. As a plus, I&#x27;m still on the same pack. I really enjoy these. They&#x27;re not crazy sharp like the feathers are, so they forgive you when you make a mistake. If you&#x27;re looking for a good set of starter blades, look no further than these Astra Blades.</li>
    <li> Wish I had found you sooner, could not remember your name, and your blades were the best...will be ordering soon</li>
    <li> A decent blade. I&#x27;d recommend them to try. Better than other blades in this price range, and at least for me, gives a better shave than most blades in this range.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband. I ordered a him a safety straight razor &amp; locally no one carries these type of blades. Great price for so many blades. He&#x27;s really impressed with the clean shave it gives him without any irritation.</li>
    <li> The blades work very well and arrived promptly, for this price I would recommend them to anyone that uses this type of blade and even those that don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> These are very good razor blades for a very nice price, I&#x27;ve just gotten into traditional shaving and the price of these blade allow to to shave with a fresh blade for sometime.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. Great shave. Low, low price.  What more could you want from a blade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: There are four dots of adhesive on one side of each blade holding it to the wax paper.  I just, carefully, wiped most of it off with a finger before loading it into my razor.  It comes off real easy.</li>
    <li> these blades are on my face the most inexpensive, comfortable shavers. They are a good intro to the awesome St. Petersburg blades.</li>
    <li> For under $10, I now have 100 razors, which means I probably won&#x27;t need to buy any for over a year.  Super sharp &amp; well made.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending $12-15 for three razor blades. So I went old school. My Grandfather had his old single blade razor that he was going to throw away. I saw recently on a site that razors like that were coming back. So saving the $45 for the razor I bought the blades. Works like a charm and my face is baby smooth.</li>
    <li> These razor blades shipped VERY fast. they fit perfectly into my double edge safety razor. They give me a nice and close shave. Will definitely buy these again when I eventually run out.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe you can buy this many blades for so cheap! I went through a sampler pack and ended up liking these blades best over many others including feathers.</li>
    <li> 100 blades for 10.39 thats super cheap&lt;br /&gt;Using them with a Feather Double Edge Shaving Razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have Feather razors&lt;br /&gt;the feather razors cost more at 13.95 for 50 but they are a better choice they seem to shave my face with less irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is nice to have a choice and I won&#x27;t run out soon tho</li>
    <li> It came in two days,well packed.It is very low in cost,but serve the purpose well. It is very sharp and i use it to trim sideburns and mustash. I would recommend it with out any reservation.&lt;br /&gt;  Vasudevan Rajasenan.</li>
    <li> I was using 7am blades for some time but found them to be a little harsh on my skin also&lt;br /&gt;they lost their sharpness too soon. Astra on the other hand gave me very smooth shaves&lt;br /&gt;also no irritation so loving them so far. I will update this review if I find anything otherwise.</li>
    <li> I get about a week per blade. Great value for the money. The current store selection we have is designed to screw you out of as much money as possible and is a monopoly. $20 for 10 atra blades ? What a ripoff. How can we screw the customer ?</li>
    <li> I read a lot of sources, and came to the conclusion that there are 2 primary schools of thought for people getting into the safety razor scene when it comes to blade choice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Buy a sampler pack - try a bunch of options, see what works, then buy more of those.  Pros - variety.  Cons - expensive, and you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s your shaving technique or the blade that&#x27;s an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Buy one line of blades - Buy a bunch of one blade, try it out, learn to shave, improve your shaving technique, then try out another blade once your technique is good.  This isolates the improvement to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to spend $ instead of $$$ and buy 100 of a blade I&#x27;d never tried, but that reviewed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 10 of them so far, and can get a good 3-4 shaves out of each one before I replace them.  They&#x27;re so cheap that I don&#x27;t feel bad changing them that frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying these out, and if they work, great!  If not... you&#x27;re out $10.</li>
    <li> These are way better than the store band blades which are all I can find at my local pharmacy and easy less expensive. While I hear a lot about feather, I don&#x27;t much want to pay 3x the price. Even though we&#x27;re talking 25 cents vs 8 cents I&#x27;ll likely sick with these. 100 bases will last forever (it seems)</li>
    <li> These blades are perfectly sharp and at roughly 10 cents a pop - I use a new blade for each shave. Not that these get dull quicker than other brands, but I like having a perfectly clean blade touching my skin.</li>
    <li> For what ever reason the disposable blades just don&#x27;t work like double edge blades. I have always used double edge blades and now I always will, and a lot cheaper. Cheaper and better, yeah that&#x27;s the world I live in.</li>
    <li> Horrible blade. First one I used tore my face up. Hoping it was an anomaly but I started reading other reviews so it probably isn&#x27;t. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I bought these many, many months ago and I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll ever use them all.  Great blades, especially for the money.</li>
    <li> Best quality, nice balance between sharpness and being overly sharp. Works well with semi sensitive skin but full beard. Not as sharp as some of the Japanese blades but also much kinder on sensitive skin or beginner single blade shavers.</li>
    <li> Good Blades, and inexpensive</li>
    <li> Having good results with the Astra.</li>
    <li> Decent razors, worth the money alone.</li>
    <li> These blades work amazingly well.  Tremendous price--will not be disappointed with this purchase.  I have compared most blades and these work bet for me.</li>
    <li> After experimenting with a number of DE blades from one of those mutipacks, I decided the Astra Platinum was for me. A DE blade is a very personal thing, so let me tell you what I was after. I wanted a blade that could sustain a good edge for a week of shaving while leaving my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s... well, you know. I shave with a Merkur Futur at the 2.5 setting and I have learned to navigate my facial hair grain directions (many for me) pretty well. I experience very little resistance in the blade even after a few shaves... in fact, there isn&#x27;t really much of a pull after a week. I personally think these are some of the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve used. I definitely recommend that you try these blades. I&#x27;ll be coming back for more! Can&#x27;t beat this deal for 100 blades!</li>
    <li> Awesome blade! great consistency between blades. Gives a great smooth shave that is pretty irritation free. I guess I should mention I use these in an Edwin Jagger DE89LBL.</li>
    <li> These blades work great for me!  Best value i have found.  I can easily get 4 shaves per blade, and you cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> With safety blades I generally look for good, standard quality. These blades have been very consistent and provide a good shave.</li>
    <li> The Astra blades are good. I used them before I was ready to try the super-sharp Feather blades. I much prefer Feather these days, but the Astras were a decent entry doe me into DE shaving.</li>
    <li> Blade quality isn&#x27;t consistent within the package. Some are as sharp as surgical instruments and others are like shaving with a broken beer bottle.</li>
    <li> I have found some other blades that work better on my face. These just weren&#x27;t sharp enough for me.</li>
    <li> I use to shave with Merkur blades and they were of course top of the line and an amazing shave. I decided to pick these blades up because, well, 100 blades for like $12 is an awesome deal. I read reviews on the blades from other websites and everyone has been raving about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the moment of truth arrived and I had the opportunity to shave with them. It was the best shave I have ever had, even better than Merkur. These blades must have been forged in pure vodka, because they are cheap, yet strong, and super comfortable to shave with.</li>
    <li> Great razor blades, at Excellent price. would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are excellent. The razors that came with my handle didn&#x27;t last long and weren&#x27;t sharp. Now shaving is just as easy as with my mach 3 but at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These don&#x27;t cause extra razor burn, last at least 3 shaves (often more), and are very sharp (in just the right way).</li>
    <li> Of the different brands of razors it get multiple shaves for each blade. Saves me time and money to buy this much larger package.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance when used in a Mühle R89. Similar to Wilkinson Sword, although possibly with less longevity. The Astra SP seems sharper than Derby (which also delivers a reasonably smooth shave in the R89). The Astra would be among my top choices, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> I will never run out of razors ever again!</li>
    <li> These revitalized double-edge shaving for me.  I&#x27;d been using Gilette blades since forever, but they&#x27;re getting harder to find and more expensive over they years.  They also seem to be poorer quality than I remember from even a decade ago.  I&#x27;d been switching back-and-forth between disposables and my trusty double-edge razor for a while, when I found these more or less by accident and ordered a box.  They&#x27;re delightfully sharp, flexible, and made with very tight tolerances and high quality control.  I get a great shave every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get at least two days out of each edge (they&#x27;d probably be good for 4-5 days per edge), so 400 days in a box.  That&#x27;s over a year of daily shaving with a far nicer blade than you can get in the shaving aisle of your grocery store (at least in the U.S.).</li>
    <li> The blades themselves are fantastic. I love how sharp they are and that I can get a fair number of repeat uses out of a blade. The downside is that they have a lot of glue holding them into the wax paper and this glue remains on the blade after removal.</li>
    <li> These are great blades for someone who is new to the wet shaving method. They are not super-sharp which is very helpful as you will minimize cutting yourself. I bought this pack of 100 before I found out about the sample packs and I was concerned that I have bought a huge number of blades that might not serve the purpose but these blades have never given me any problems. No irritation or shaving bumps and they give a very smooth shave. I would highly recommend them</li>
    <li> I have been using a Double-Edged Safety Razor for about five years now. I started with a sampler pack, but as soon as ran out of blades, I proceeded to use the CVS brand blades, which I believe were made by Persona. I eventually decided to try Feathers, a blade that was widely praised amongst DE enthusiasts. They have given me over a year of good shaves, but one day I had the opportunity to try Astra SP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are phenomenal, and about one-third of the price of Feathers. They are a hair(no pun intended) less sharp, but very smooth. My technique is now very good, so I rarely see blood from either blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, Astra SP cannot be outmatched. They are just as good as Feathers, very similar in my opinion. Buy them today.</li>
    <li> I got a variety pack from an acquaintance before I bought in bulk. Glad I did because I was able to seek out a great brand of blade and find it at a respectable price. Clearly blade preference varies from person to person, but if it helps: I have a moderately soft/fine full beard (I&#x27;m a ginger). I started several years ago with Merkur blades and though I prefer them, Astra quality is more than adequate and the price is much more reasonable. I get GREAT shaves with these blades!</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping. awesome</li>
    <li> These blades work great.  A ton of them for half the price of those Gilette cartridges.  Better shave and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> good blades, worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two 100 packs and continue to use them every time I shave. The small packs are great for throwing in a travel bag.</li>
    <li> The price is good and the customer service provided was superb.  The blades are definitely not the same Astra SP I&#x27;ve grown to love in the past.  These feel dull and rough on the skin.  I decided to use them only once and change out the blade for the sake of not taking them to the recycling center and lose the $10 spent on them.  With the TRUE Astra SPs, I can get a smooth shave 4 days in a row.  I can&#x27;t get a single smooth shave from these &amp;#34;Astra SP&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Razors are a fairly subjective and personal thing, and these work well for me. It is rather fortunate they also happen to be so affordable.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite DE blades and they are a steal at this price.  Just try and compare to your regular cartridge razor blade prices.  These work out to about 10 cents a blade and I get 3 shaves from them.  Sharp and good, my go-to blade.</li>
    <li> These are my second favorite razors, and are so close in quality and shave to my favorite, Feather Platinum, that i don&#x27;t see the point in paying the price difference. Plus these came in a pack of 100.</li>
    <li> Bought these almost a year ago - plenty of them left to go. Will last over a year with a nice handle.</li>
    <li> Great Value for the money, I actually like them better than some more expensive brands</li>
    <li> Perfect blade, I have tough beard hair - this has no problems with my thick stubble and rough skin.</li>
    <li> For the price they are awesome. I switched to a Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor several months ago and bought these blades at the same time. And I will never go back to those expensive Gillette razors. I usually use them for about a week then  put in a new blade. I can&#x27;t compare them to any other double edge safety blades but I will definitely be buying more of these when I run out.</li>
    <li> For me, these are just OK. They are not as sharp as Feathers and do nick me up more than average. Obviously, this could just be because these blades don&#x27;t get along with my particular face. They are sharper than average and it&#x27;s a great deal on 100 blades</li>
    <li> They are not the best blades i have but overall good. I also use the Feather blades, which are very sharp but they are expensive. So for light shaves i use this, but when i skip a day of shaving, i use the feather blades. They are sharp enough to get me 2 or 3 shaves before disposal. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Better than the Shark&#x27;s on my face. I get about three shaves out of a blade, but it takes several strokes with and against the grain to get that baby butt smooth shave my wife likes. The price is right, so I change the blade every three days, but I am going to try some others before I settle. Astra is in the running so far....</li>
    <li> When I started DE shaving about four months ago I ordered a blade sampler to try to determine which I would like best. Blades seem to be a very personal choice based on your razor, skin, and beard type. Samplers are therefore very helpful in determining what blade is best for you. Astra SP was maybe the third or fourth blade I tried and it immediately became the standard against which I judged the rest of the blades. It effortlessly sliced through the whiskers. I kept coming back to it.  I even ordered a few more 5 packs of various other blades just to make sure this was the one for me and it obviously was because I just purchased 100 of them. I typically get three or four shaves out of a blade; I could stretch it farther but why when they are this inexpensive?  These blades appear to be very popular with people that are new to traditional wet shaving due to their reputation as sharp but not so harsh as a Feather blade (Feathers seem to be the gold standard in sharpness). The Astras are much more forgiving, and a great value to boot.  I am using them in a Merkur 23C and do a three pass shave. My beard is somewhat thick and I shave six days a week. Remember that good lather is just as (if not more) important as blade choice when it comes to DE shaving! Hope this is helpful.  Enjoy your shave!</li>
    <li> I could go on and on about how much I love these blades, especially after using up a trial package of Sharks. The Sharks never felt very sharp and I always felt like I was walking around with a half-baked shave. It sometimes felt like they would tug on the hair rather than cleanly shear it off, even if it was a brand-new blade. The Astras are superior in every way and the sharpness is immediately evident. Yes, the super-sharp edge has its downsides, I get nicked a little more than I did with the Sharks, but the Astras have never once given me razor burn, which was something I was trying to escape by switching to a double-edge razor. These are fabulous blades for the price at just over $0.10 each, and enough to last me for a year or more.</li>
    <li> Only the second type of DE blade I&#x27;ve tried, but these are very nice. Sharp without being scary sharp, and they last for a few shaves, or give one very close shave each.  The price is right, (12 USD shipped) and when I&#x27;ve tried more blades, I&#x27;ll come back and write about how they stack up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several DE Blades (sample pack) and these are the ones that work best for me. At less than 10 cents per blade, they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I settled on these for my bulk blades purchase after sampling about a dozen different ones. I get at least 5 good shaves per blade and they are so cheap why bother trying for more? These are forgiving blades and I rarely get a nick with them. I do three-pass shaves and these can give me baby butt smooth (BBS) shaves. These are popular for a reason. Very good value. One annoying thing are the glue/wax dots they put on the blade for sealing the wax paper to it, I think. Sometimes it looks like it flowed onto the cutting part of the blade.On some razors they will leave residue on that you will notice when you change blades and is annoying to clean off. I understand this is a common trait of all blades made at this factory. Yo, Russkies! Figure another way or reduce the amount of glue/wax per dot! Minus .5 stars for this.</li>
    <li> These blades are really, really, really good!  Way better than the shark blades.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be switching, well, maybe for Feathers.</li>
    <li> Purchased on 1/15/13 for a little less than 9 bucks and today they&#x27;re about 2 bucks more. I also purchased a Lord double edge razor [[ASIN:B004N77JVY Lord Premium Safety Razor Model LP1822L aka L6]] and was not impressed with the blade that came with it... lots of nicks but the razor is great. The Astra Superior blades are really nice, especially under 9 bucks... and no nicks yet. I have what I would call a medium beard and should be shaving daily based on how it grows but the blades I purchased handle my stubble nicely. The razor was a little under 13 bucks so once I factor that cost out I think I&#x27;ll get about 3 good shaves off a blade so that&#x27;s about 9 cents a week... under 5 bucks a year... for my shaving cost. Adding in a few bars of soap I&#x27;ll likely get about 4 years of shaving for the cost of 1 year of replacement Norelco heads. Lastly, since it&#x27;s the blade that does the work I find spending a few bucks more on them is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these blades! They are VERY cheap, but are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that compare at all to the excellent Feather blades. I find that the first shave is a tiny bit rough, but after that, I can shave for almost 2 weeks at 90% of the smoothness of the Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are smoother and longer lasting than any I&#x27;ve tried previously, which include: Darby, Big Ben Blue or Purple, Lord, or Lord Platinum.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try after reading good things about Astra. Previously I had been using Feather&#x27;s blades. While I don&#x27;t feel that these blades give as good of a shave, we aren&#x27;t talking about quantifiable differences. It&#x27;s something more along the difference between a 9.5 and a 9.0. This difference is more than made up in the value though, and I do believe it&#x27;s a significant step up from other brands. All said and done, I&#x27;ll continue buying these as the value is spectacular and the difference is too small.</li>
    <li> these razors are great for the price nice and sharp I have less irriation using them. They glide and are very smooth more forgiving then some of the other blades I&#x27;ve used. Not sure they are as sharp a the feather blades though... Still great blades though..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Derby blades for a while. I&#x27;ve found these to be a superior shave. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve gotten better at shaving over the years, but I find I cut myself less with these blades. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they do not come with a hard plastic protective sleeve. I like to put my old blades back into these case to safely dispose of them. It&#x27;s defirinalty worth the couple extra bucks to buy these over the Derby blades.</li>
    <li> These blades have been great, I used to use the personna blue labs and these are much sharper and the stay sharp for a longer period of time. Highly recommend these blades, and the price can&#x27;t be beat</li>
    <li> These are great! Very sharp, and a very close shave, even compared to quality safety razors (just be careful; these are SHARP!). There was a noticeable difference between these and the samples that came with the handle that I ordered. Again, be careful, and be sure to not press down very hard. Difficult places I sometimes skip and use a safety razor (like around the nose), just so that I don&#x27;t take off too much skin with those pesky hairs!</li>
    <li> They are super sharp, they fit my razor, and they&#x27;re cleanly individually wrapped. What else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Good blades and seller was quick to ship!  Would order again!!</li>
    <li> Great deal for 100 blades!!!</li>
    <li> excellent blades, they last longer</li>
    <li> The blades are great.  They last a long time.  I use them shaving my head (after clipping my hair close).  I had used a Gillette Sensor for 20 years so these are a great substitute for a fraction of the cost of blades.</li>
    <li> these were very thin and my husband did not like, so i am stuck with this big box of bad blades.</li>
    <li> great for the price, but dull quickly. blades last for two shaves tops.</li>
    <li> I am a Barber and I must say these are by far the best double edged blades I have ever used for the money.&lt;br /&gt;They hold a good edge and I almost cant tell there is a blade in the razor they are so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;If the price doesn&#x27;t go up I&#x27;ll coninue to buy these on a subscription and get them even cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these for any barber it is so much easier to only have to pop in a new blade and keep rolling honing and stropping is so time consumming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK price was about $8.50 or so with subscription now its gone up $2 does this mean all barbers across the states should charge $2 dollars more than normal I mean really com-on-man!&lt;br /&gt;They can change there prices and I can change my review : )</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to double edge shaving like I was a few months ago, listen up. I have some tips for you. You&#x27;ll have to assemble some products for a quality shave. First, do like I do; get yourself an ADJUSTABLE razor. Why? If a blade is too sharp or it&#x27;s not shaving close enough, you can simply dial up or dial down the setting. I recommend a vintage Gillette adjustable from the 60s like a Slim or Fat Boy. They&#x27;re made from solid rolled brass and coated with nickel; they&#x27;ll last forever. (Compare that to some modern razors made out of pot metal. If you drop it, it cracks.) Third, your double edge blade. Try a sample pack. Usually, they have the top brands included, and make sure one of the brands is the Astra SP (Superior Platinum). You probably read about the Feather being the sharpest. Yeah, they&#x27;re sharp, but only for 2 shaves. Astra are smooth on top of being sharp; shaving with one is like a hot knife through butter. It feels like you don&#x27;t have a blade in the razor. Good luck and enjoy shaving again. I wish you many baby butt smooth shaves in the future.</li>
    <li> I consider these to be a great value.  I&#x27;m not yet a DE shaving aficionado, but find these blades to offer an acceptable shave.  I can only get two or three uses from each blade, but at such a low cost, it doesn&#x27;t matter!</li>
    <li> To be fair these are the only DE blades I&#x27;ve ever used, but they work perfectly for me and are definitely a step up from my old cartridge razor. I don&#x27;t see myself spending money on new blades anytime soon.</li>
    <li> these are the best razors i have used. i used Sharp brand razors for 2 year and these are considerably better. i love it!  for the price it is a steal. if you,re looking to switch over to REAL shaving, as opposed to 8 bladed ( or whatever they are up to these days) clown shavers, i would recommend starting on these blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to the double-edge shaving world. Was seeking a better way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was relatively happy with the blades that came supplied with my new double-edged razor. After thinking about a huge sampler pack I decided to give these a whirl. I had read some reviews that these were good for guys with sensitive skin - which I have. I&#x27;m about 5 blades into my 100 pack and am so far very impressed. I can&#x27;t really see myself trying anything else unless it&#x27;s just for fun I guess? These work very well and I am expecting them to last me a LONG time. I use 1 blade for 2-3 shaves. I haven&#x27;t decided whether 2 or 3 is the optimal number of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if you get them, pay no attention to the numbers on the blades themselves, they are just used in the manufacturing process.</li>
    <li> After buying a variety pack with 8+ different brand types, Astra was the one that didn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin while barely nicking me. Even after trying other blades after using Astra, I came back to these guys. They are very sharp and give a smooth shave on my face. Yet, my neck and face are no longer left feeling on fire or irritated/embarassingly bright red for 2-3 days afterward like when I used to shave with the disposable Gilettes. Oh, what relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides this benefit, the next best thing with this pack is the cost. For $9 you get 100 blades. Generally, I change my blades once a week, meaning one blade per week equals out to 100 weeks -- that&#x27;s two years&#x27; worth of blades for $9!! If you&#x27;re shaving with over-priced, crappy-quality disposables you&#x27;ll win the lottery before you find a deal like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, some of the concerns of other reviewers I can empathize with. I really only get 2-3 shaves before I need to change the blade, which does seem a bit underwhelming. However, with the price, quantity, and quality for these blades that obviously does not deter the 5-star review from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, and on a completely random tangent, I read somewhere that the numbers on each sides of the blades mean nothing at all of significance. The interesting part is that I sometimes get a noticeably better shave when I use the \\&quot;3-4\\&quot; side of the blade facing up versus the \\&quot;1-2\\&quot; side facing up. Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing, brothers: one of the best decisions I have ever made was switching to shaving with DE safety razors. From there, one of the most important decisions a man will make after doing the same will be choosing which blades to shave with. As other reviewers here have pointed out, Astra may do wonders for your face as with mine. On the other hand, Astra blades may wreck your face while Derby will do just the trick. Before buying this, make sure you&#x27;ve been able to try out different blades in a variety pack. However, if you&#x27;ve found Astra to be your skin&#x27;s pal, make both your face and wallet happy and buy this pack.</li>
    <li> Not a bad shave on the first shave, second shave a little rough. I started replacing every shave or two. I do have coarse facial hair and am a long time feather user. My brother in law used these blades and with his lighter hair he is happy with them in place of his usual feathers. They are definitely much less aggressive than the feathers but I find that they miss spots no matter how much time I take. Two passes a must for me with these blades. I will go back to the feathers once I use these up, and at one or two shaves per blade that will not take long</li>
    <li> I started using these razor blades a couple of months ago and I like them better than the Shark blades I had been using for the past 3 years. The Astra shave a bit smoother (for my beard) and I can get 1-1/2 to 2 weeks out of a single blade, about the same as the Shark.  These are a great value for 100 blades, so I&#x27;m good for the next 3 years!</li>
    <li> I am pretty new to the world of safety razor shaving. I switched from the cartridge razors due to the high cost associated with replacing blades that become quickly clogged with my man-beard. I have been using the blade that came with my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] for weeks, and much more enjoy the shaving experience. It does take a bit longer, but I will probably never shave any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About these blades though. For how stupidly cheap they are, they are amazingly sharp. I anticipate using about $1 per year... maybe. Each blade is in a little paper sleeve inside of a paperboard sleeve, so very protected. Though, note, TSA doesn&#x27;t approve of flying with them. For the price, I&#x27;m just going to mail 5 to each of the relatives we could visit, and have them store them for me (double edge safety razor blades are reasonably hard to find in the walmarts, walgreens, etc of the world).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, buy these, they&#x27;re much bueno.</li>
    <li> I love these blades and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a close shave at a very insanely reasonable price.  Simply put, these blades are sharp, durable, and at the price they charge, you can choose to have a new blade every day.</li>
    <li> Very good blades and supercheap</li>
    <li> I get the most consistent and best shaves out of theses blades. Great price and I usually get 4-5 shaves out of a blade. I know I could toss them sooner, but I get smooth shaves so no need to toss a blade early even though they are super cheap.</li>
    <li> Get the Murker adjustable razor to take full advantage of these blades, do be careful and use the razor very lightly and you will be rewarded, or be careless and break out the tissue.  The adjustable razor makes the blade.</li>
    <li> Super sharp, and works well for my face. This should give you 2 or 3 good shaves before it deteriorates.</li>
    <li> I chose these blade after researching several blades and actually shaving with them.  I&#x27;ve tried Derby, Gillette, Wilkinson, Feather and cheaper brands.  These blades are very comparable to Feather Platinum blades at a fraction of the cost.  You can get an average of three (3) close shaves with these very nice blades.  Shop around for great deals on 100 count packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note of these blades come double wrapped.</li>
    <li> Never used any other razors for my shavette, and I have been using these almost 2 years. Why change?? These are great!</li>
    <li> Great value -- will last me for 2 years since I change blades once a week...</li>
    <li> Unlike many new wet shavers, I did not purchase a blade sampler pack; I went straight for the Astras after reading tons of positive things on B&amp;B. Understanding that I can&#x27;t compare, I can say that these blades are super sharp, &amp; I&#x27;ve never felt them tug unless I try to get three shaves out of a blade (most people get more shaves per blade, but I shave my face and head daily, so 2x the surface area). I&#x27;m thinking of eventually picking up a sampler, but I certainly don&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good blades. Hydrate face properly... No problems.</li>
    <li> I bought these razor blades after using them in a 16-blade sample pack I bought from Amazon during my initial foray into the world of DE safety razors. The pack included various styles of Gillette blades, Feather, Astra, and several others. Out of all of them I found that Astra worked best for my skin. Most of the blades (all of the Gillette blades and the numerous &#x27;no name&#x27; brands) irritated my skin due to being too dull. On the other hand, the Feather blades were far too sharp and it looked like Jack the Ripper had gotten a hold of me after every shave. Astra was the perfect middle ground, and the price (especially compared to Feather) was right as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, everyone&#x27;s face/hair is different so you should experiment with a variety of blades to see which ones suit you. I know people who claim that Astra is too irritating for them and they prefer some of the ones that I felt were too dull.</li>
    <li> comfortable to hold and to shave with.  I have been shaving with disposable blades for three years and had to set the Merkur on 1.5 to shave comfortably.  The longer handle would probably be more comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> I have used MANY types of razors and razor blades in the past (Gillette Fusion, electric razors from many brands, Merkur to name  a few), and they would either cut my face (Merkur), leave it beet red (electric razors), or miss some areas (Gillette Fusion). I have been using the Astra blades for a couple weeks in my Merkur safety razor, and I will say these are by far the best I have used to date! No nicks or cuts (and yes, I do not apply any pressure as to cause irritation), and a perfect shave every time. Well worth the $11 for 100 blades!!</li>
    <li> Throw those 15-blade razors away. Get yourself a $5-30 double-edge razor and a pack of these things and shave all year long for pennies. Good blades. Everyone&#x27;s face is a bit different but these seem to be the defacto well-priced standard. Derby&#x27;s are decent too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sampled several brands of double edge safety razor blades and have found the Astra blades to give a comfortable, close shave and the blades last a long time.</li>
    <li> Cant beat $0.10 blades! I get a good shaves. I don&#x27;t like to use these more then 2 shaves then i switch them out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Started a few months ago with a Merkur razor and ordered a 20 variet blade pack to try different brands.  I settled on the Astra SP once I ran out of those.  I purchased a 100 pack for only $9.00 (will last me a year)!!!  Am loving them.  Great product.</li>
    <li> You really cannot beat this price, which is about 8.8 cents per blade. I am still new to we shaving, as I started on Christmas 2012. i have tried Merkur, dorco and now astra blades. My favorite so far seems to be Astra, but i am no expert to be giving opinion by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades seem to be a good balance between sharp enough, but not too sharp. i know this because I&#x27;ve gotten a bit sloppy at times and i did not cut my face wide open. I think they have lasted around 3 or 4 shaves, but this will vary due to many factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these 100 blades will last me forever!</li>
    <li> Cuts really smooth with no tugging. I&#x27;ve hacked at my face with the Derby blades that came with my Edwin Jagger DB89L and these were night and day better. Definitely give these a try!</li>
    <li> Box came in excellent condition and the blades are perfect.  Love the close shave husband gets and he likes how quick the blades cut.  He gets no razor burn from these blades.  Would and have recommended these blades to shavers.</li>
    <li> never actually experienced not having to apply any pressure to shave.  thought it was a figure of speech.&lt;br /&gt;not very forgiving for multiple passes, but once you get used to them, you won&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-7 shaves on each blade too.</li>
    <li> These are really good blades. very sharp, but it gets the job done if handled properly.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for the quantity.  Sharp, Individually wrapped and sealed. 20 small cartons within the box each containing 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> My barber only uses Astras and recommended them over the higher priced blades. Although there are sharper DE blades that are more comfortable, for the price Astras perform amazing. Smooth and cheap enough for a one time use. Can&#x27;t beat the quality or the price point.</li>
    <li> I get razor smooth shaves with these blades and my Merkur 180. Compared to the Merkur blades my safety razor came with, these are miles ahead. The platinum coating really helps a lot on the first 1-2 shaves and the blade just glides on your skin without any catching. I only shave with these once a week (so the blades have longer to rust), but given that, it lasts me at least 2 if not 3 shaves before the blade starts getting rough on the skin. The best part of this is that the price of this pack is an absolute steal -- you&#x27;re paying &amp;#60; 10 cents a blade!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a bunch of different blades this year, and when I used the Astra Platinum, I knew it was going to be my go-to blade, long-term. Not only does it last longer than any brand I&#x27;ve used-2 months is not uncommon-but it does it while giving you an incredibly comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I am a cutter, so these blades are great to carry around and dip off into a corner and ease my pain.  I just want to be alternative and accepted.  If you lose one, no big deal you got 99 left.  Sometime I use them for a great shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. I usually shave when I get a full beard and it&#x27;s nice to be able to take out a fresh blade and cut right through the forest.  Have had no problems.</li>
    <li> I love these blades. For me, a single blade lasts for quite a few shaves. It will be some time before I need to refill again. Great product and great value.</li>
    <li> Very well made&lt;br /&gt;I get a nice, no rash shave</li>
    <li> Sold! 100 Blades for $10.00. Put first one in my safety razor.  A smooth close cut.  I am good for 2 years for blades.  All the new fangled razors be damned.</li>
    <li> A great old school way to shave. Razor sharp with a reasonable expectation of 6 shaves per blade and 100 blades for less than $15.00.</li>
    <li> I just started shaving with safety razors not too long ago, decided to go with this brand for the blades. I can&#x27;t speak for everyone but I&#x27;m impressed of the close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering its price, I thought the blades won&#x27;t even last three shaving sessions. 100 blades vs. in-store 5 blades for the same price, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I&#x27;m satisfied with the results after each shave; I shave every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that not everyone will have the same opinion/review since you have to factor in things like batch of blades, amount and type of facial hair.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. This 100 pack will probably last me 5 years since I have every other day and 1 razor will last about 3-4 shaves for me. Granted I am asian and have a lot less facial hair than most.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these blades. I&#x27;ve tried 20+ different types, including the famous Feather blades, but I always come back to these. I always get a close, comfortable shave, and the price is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every other blade I have tried either doesn&#x27;t get as close, or tugs, pulls, or cuts me too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion these are the best blades in the world.</li>
    <li> These are my daily drivers, my daily work horses, my Cal Ripkens, my Old Faithful&#x27;s, my Lou Gehrig&#x27;s, my Derek Jeter&#x27;s...get the picture?!  These are extremely dependable, extremely capable, extremely sharp....and unlike all of above examples they are cheap!</li>
    <li> I just started using DE razors and these razors received pretty good reviews. So far these razors are living up to those reviews because they are lasting along time, at least 7 shaves for my face. So much cheaper using DE razors then using the cartridge type razors.</li>
    <li> Good razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;I probably get about as many shaves with this blade before it starts becoming a little dull as I do with the Overpriced multi blades I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thing is, these are dirt cheap compared to the multis.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;You do the math!</li>
    <li> I started off with Merkur blades and switched to Feather a couple of years ago because I wanted a sharper blade.  Feather&#x27;s are fantastic but I find if you shave daily the sharpness can become a problem as they start to irritate the skin.  I just tried Astra blades after reading reviews and have to say I am very impressed.  They are close to Feather in sharpness but a lot smoother.  This may well become my go-to blade.  I use the EJ89 which is a wonderful razor and it seems to pair well.</li>
    <li> Razor blades are a subjective thing but these blades received so many positive reviews I had to give them a shot.  For me, these are perfect.  Just the right amount of &amp;#34;sharpness&amp;#34; and they glide right over your skin without cuts or nicks.  A great value too!</li>
    <li> It is too for me soon to make a real assessment as to quality and performance of these blades. They seem well made and I have shaved up to 5 times with the same blade and have had no noticeable decrease in sharpness or serviceability.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for any one. Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Best in the market.&lt;br /&gt;i am going to buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m new to double-edged shaving and was recommended by online reviews to use astra blades for first-timers. Blades are super sharp and smooth, easy to use and handle. Blades are packaged into plain white wax paper but learned online that &#x27;true authentic&#x27; astra blades comes in green astra printed paper. Again don&#x60;t have anything to compare with, but the blades do the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on the product and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Work great as expected....good deal for products.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite blades.  Smooth shave, not too harsh...</li>
    <li> For the price, these work well. However, I don&#x27;t think they work as well as the Merkur razor blades that I&#x27;ve used in the past. [[ASIN:B000JPMHWK Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
    <li> good quality shave blade no compliants</li>
    <li> This is the second DE blade I&#x27;ve ever used, so take this for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Merkur &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; blades and getting 3-4 good shaves out of them. I can only get one good shave out of these and that one is not as good as the first of the Merkur but they are almost half the price per shave as the Merkur&#x27;s. I&#x27;ll probably try another brand after I get through these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their only plus is that they&#x27;re cheap an you can use a new blade every shave.</li>
    <li> Beats proprietary cartridges any day! I&#x27;ve been using these blades for over two years and still have over half of the carton left. Albeit, I don&#x27;t exactly have grizzly facial hair, and I probably could change the blades more often, but I would still definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> cheap cheap cheap razor blades--both in price and in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come out of the wax paper with stains, looking like they&#x27;ve already been used. They cut OK about two times, but by the third, they&#x27;re pulling as much hair out as they&#x27;re cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more Russian crap for me!</li>
    <li> excellent price for great product.</li>
    <li> Top quality blades at a great price dont know how they sell them so cheap but Im glad they do.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades based on all of the positive reviews. But, like some other reviewers, I have found that these razors are not as sharp as others. This has lead to me going over areas several times more than with other razors, leading to irritation. Also, I tend to use more pressure with these razors, which leads to nicks and cuts. Anybody want 95 blades?</li>
    <li> Bought these along with an Edwin Jagger razor. These things glide easy and cuts hair effortlessly. No tugging or pulling. Wish I would have started DE shaving earlier!</li>
    <li> As requested by those &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34; before me, I tried about 20 blade varieties (sample packs) before stocking up when starting to wet shave... even using Evernote to record results logs after using each blade the first, second, and third times with one, two, and three pass shaves. Feather and Astra SP stomped the competition, so I went with &amp;#34;better bargain&amp;#34; Astra... and put the 100 Feather pack on my gift wish list! ;)</li>
    <li> excellent blades , perfect !</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get a better shave for the price.  Each blade gives about five quality shaves meaning this box will last for about a year and a half.  I&#x27;ve tried other blades and they don&#x27;t stand out.  These are very nice.</li>
    <li> It takes some time to get the art of &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34;, but when you do these blades are my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> You can pay more, you can pay less, but these are still the best.</li>
    <li> I love these blades with my Merkur Razor... wouldn&#x27;t even try any of the others for the price difference! .</li>
    <li> Good, sharp blades. Require a few more passes than the Sharp Stainless polymer coated ones, but no pulling on the beard.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE SAYS HE USES 1 RAZOR ATLEAST TWICE. OTHER THEN THAT HE&#x27;LL THROW IT AWAY AFTER. WITH SO MANY RAZOR WHY USE IT MORE THEN TWICE? GOOD PRODUCT LIKE I SAID BUT HAVEN&#x27;T BRANCHED OUT TO TOO MANY RAZORS. SELLER WAS GOOD AND IT CAME QUICK.</li>
    <li> Obviously DE blades are personal preference, but after sampling a ton of different kinds, these Astra Superior Premium Platinum emerged as a clear winner. Not to aggressive, I can get 2 maybe three shaves per blade, and at $.05 a blade, its hard to go wrong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always a pleasure to find a product that performs this well without any downsides. I put a new blade in my razor and got the smoothest, most comfortable, irritation free shave ever, all for about 10 cents.  Unlike so many others, I will not bash the modern Gillette cartridges, though they have gotten ridiculous.  They have long forgotten the form over function principle. My favorite is the Sensor. I still get a good shave from the Sensor and travel with one.  And yes, the cartridge prices are a bit crazy, but if you like the simplicity and convenience, why not use them.  My purpose for switching to a double edge safety razor was and is not about saving money. It was about saving my face.  I&#x27;ve gone from reluctantly shaving twice a week to shaving every day, sometimes twice per day.  I now like shaving and these Astra blades make my morning shave even more enjoyable.  My first blade lasted for 6 shaves and I really could have used it more, but decided to make a change anyways. It&#x27;s not fair to compare these Astra blades to Feather blades, as the Astras are much better on a daily basis. They are sharp enough, easily slide through my tough beard, and are extremely gentle on my skin. The Feather blades enjoy cutting anything in their path, skin included. They are not bad, these are just easier to use.  I also use Personna blades, which are quite sharp, however they aren&#x27;t quite as smooth as the Astra.  Neither the Derby blade, nor the Merkur blade impressed me, but I still got a decent shave.  The Astra Platinum blades perform equally well in my Edwin Jagger DE89lbl and my Feather Popular razors. I have no complaints at all and will use them and recommend them without reservation. I urge anyone in search of a comfortable, affordable shave to try these Astra Platinums. If you cut yourself with these blades, it is most certainly your fault.</li>
    <li> The Astra blades are amazing quality. I shave about 3 times a week and one razor lasts me a month! The price for these is just unbelievable, It costs me 10 cents a month for good clean shaves. I use them in a Merkur long handle safety razor. The razor does start off very sharp, so the first shave with a fresh razor needs to be more careful. After the first few shaves the razor becomes perfect and I can do a fast wet shave without worrying about cuts.</li>
    <li> The dispenser box is very handy and the blades are wrapped well.  These don&#x27;t like my face or handle, maybe both, but that does not deserve a down rated review.  You will get your money out of this box of blades.  My suggestion is to get a trial pack first though to see what works for you.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on different blades before I made the purchase of these. My whole point of safety razor shaving is getting a great shave for cheap. These platinum blades are doing a great job!</li>
    <li> I ordered this so I would have a virtually unlimited supply.  The ones I have tried work fine.  Sharp and smooth.</li>
    <li> These are very good blades. As you read this and other reviews you will begin to realize that different brands of blades are good or bad for different people. It is hard to explain really. It is not about which ones are sharpest, most expensive, or made of the best material. I had tried two other blades before trying Astra. These ara not the sharpest blades but they are sharp and work best for me. They are so inexpensive I just put a new one in each morning. Get the variety pack and try different blades to find which you need.It may serve you well if you are thorough to read a few reviews for each blade type found in the pack. There are a couple different variety packs with different blades. You can read these reviews all day but as soon as you try different blades in the variety pack you will know which is best for that mug on your head. Best to also invest in a beaver brush, shave soap, and a stand to hold the razor and brush. The shave with these items is great. It takes a little patience to figure out which blade is best but the shave is good and certainly more economical. I got into this when I noticed suddenly I was unable to get more than a few shaves out of Gillete Sensor cartridges that were skyrocketing in price. I am not really cheap just can&#x27;t stand it when a company does stuff like that.</li>
    <li> I bought a Merkur razor and that came with one blade. In comparison the Merkur blade was significantly better. I used the Merkur blade I think for six shaves and barely cut myself or had any resistance. With these blades, although they still work fairly well, I found myself getting cut more and not as smooth of a shave. As the title says, they&#x27;re okay. They&#x27;re not so bad that I&#x27;m going to toss the 99 remaining blades. It&#x27;s a value buy, you get what you pay for. Just ask yourself if you&#x27;re ready for probably a year worth of shaving or more with the same blades if you&#x27;re not satisfied... Maybe try a smaller pack first if they offer them? I bought for the value. They&#x27;re fine but I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******Update*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a few more razors I don&#x27;t know if my skin has gotten tougher or if I just got a bad first razor. That said my experience has definitely improved from the first razor (I am on my fourth I believe now) but I still would consider trying another brand on my next purchase as this was my first (aside from the promotional Merkur razor I received with my set). Although I am experiencing improved comfort with these blades I still feel I am not getting the longevity out of the blade I was expecting before having to put in a new blade for the same level of comfort. That said, for the price it&#x27;s hard to beat the deal, I&#x27;m just a sucker for a good deal.</li>
    <li> Plenty of blades to last a very long time. Has numerous smaller boxes of 10 and value. They stay sharp and are good quality.</li>
    <li> The blades are pretty good, especially considering how cheap they are. Not super high quality, but then, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought the variety pack, which features a few blades from many different manufacturers from around the world, and my favorite ended up being this one from Russia.  It did the best job of giving a close shave, but what i liked best is that it was the smoothest and easiest glide of them all, and the blade is good for a week of shaving before changing it.</li>
    <li> I recently went back old school when it comes to shaving hoping to get the cost of shaving down and save some money. I only shave a couple of times a week so I have enough razors to last me for a year now. shaving with an old school double edge safety razor is a forgotten skill that I think a lot of people would be interested in relearning. Not only to save money but to get a nice close shave too. If you decide to go this route as i have you will not regret it. You will get a few nicks at first but you will soon master the art of the double edge shaver and start saving money while getting a close shave.</li>
    <li> well worth the price.  For someone like me that only needs to use his DE razor every other day, this makes up a year supply for $10 (when I originally bought it).  If fact a year is about to pass and I have probably only used half of the razors because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t shave as often as I originally planned!</li>
    <li> Bought these to try out as I&#x27;ve used persona and feathers already. I found these nice for shaving my head as they&#x27;re not to aggressive and tend to be more gentle. I still use feathers and personas on my face though.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to DE shaving (started in December 2012) and have discovered (or confirmed) that razor blades are definitely a &amp;#34;YMMV&amp;#34; item.  Based on several forum recommendations, I purchased various sampler packs containing a wide assortment of razor blade brands.  Before this purchase, i really thought that a blade is a blade and they are all the same - I was definitely wrong with this initial comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my testing, the three blades that separated from the rest were Feathers, Super Iridiums, and the Astra SPs.  My normal shaving process is WTG, XTG, ATG (3 passes total).  The above 3 blades shaved smoothly and efficiently - There was never a need to go beyond 3 passes and sometimes only 2 passes were needed to obtain an exceptionally clean face.  All 3 blades worked well in my Merkur 23C/180 and Parker 99R razors.  The Feathers were just a tad sharper (more so when i used them in my 99R).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I bought this 100 pack of Astras due to slightly longer durability and significantly better pricing.  I have sparse but very coarse facial hair - Feathers give me 2-3 smooth shaves while I can get 3-4 (sometimes 5) smooth shaves with Iridiums/Astras.  It is a no-brainer when you factor in that Astras are $9 for 100 blades compared to $30 (Feathers) and $35 (Iridiums) for the same blade count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to packaging, the Astras blades are individually wrapped in a paper held together by a very small amount of wax.  I have never taken the time to wipe off this wax as my shaving has never been negatively impacted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with Astra SP blades.  It&#x27;s a double-bonus when high-performance comes at a very inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> I started using a safety razor about 6 months ago coming from disposable blades. This is the second brand I&#x27;ve tried. The first one being the Derby Extra sample blades that came with the razor. I&#x27;ve used 3 Astra blades and so far I&#x27;m not impressed. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed in general about using a safety razor is that there is little to no irritation compared to disposables, they last longer and are easier to clean. Also, it is a lot cheaper to shave with safety razors, in the long run, compared to disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not all blades will give a good shave to everyone. Comparing this two brands I noticed immediately that this brand nicks my skin a lot more than the Derby Extras and the disposable ones. The nicks are small, I don&#x27;t feel when I get nicked and heal quickly with little bleeding but it&#x27;s annoying. They do, however, stay sharp longer than the Derby Extras. I use a good shaving cream, a brush and even tried pre-shaving oils with no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades might work well for others but not for me. I may try a different brand or go back to the Derby Extra. Like others have said, the best option is to buy samples before committing to one brand.</li>
    <li> I am new to shaving with a double edged safely razor, but after reading a lot of reviews on here and on various online forums I decided I wanted to use these with my Edwin Jagger safety razor.  They are very sharp, but the feel of the shave is incredible.  Once I worked my way up to shaving across the grain I really started to see the difference between a Gillette razor and Edwin Jagger razor with Astra blades.  My face stays smooth for almost until almost the next morning when i shave again.  Great blade and come conveniently packaged.</li>
    <li> Awsome, great razor and even better price. YOU MUST BUY THEM . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</li>
    <li> These razors work incredibly well, and you can&#x27;t beat the value.  They are the smoothes and sharpest razors I&#x27;ve used in my double-edged safety razor.  They provide an irritation free shave.  I recommend them to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for a month and really like these Astra blades. Sharp yet forgiving. Much better than the Derby blades that came with my Edwin Jagger razor.</li>
    <li> I have recently switched to the old time flat double edge razor.  I really wanted to go with a straight razor, but have to say that I am a little worried about silting my own throat.  So my wife bought me a very nice Italian made safety razor where you unscrew the handle and place the flat double edge blades in the head.  I LOVE IT!!! I have no idea how in the world we have been convinced by advertising to use commercialized razors and shave creams and gels that don’t last, give you razor burn and “shave bumps”.  My face and neck has never been as happy as it is now. I don’t have razor burn any more and I actually enjoy shaving.  Not to mention how cheap I can shave for compared to the so called modern ways.&lt;br /&gt;My razor came with one or two blades and I used them while trying to make a decision on which blade to use long term.  I know I should have bought one of the sample blade packs first, but after reading enough reviews and comparing prices, I chose the Astra blade.  It appeared to have the best reviews for the price.  I did not want to find a blade I really loved, just to be triple the price and feel guilty for buying it and then if I didn’t buy it fell like I settled for less.  I know how my mind works.  Astra seems to work very well for me. I shave three to four times a week (even though I need to shave every day, but like to give my skin a rest) and change out my blade every Sunday morning even though the blade still feels sharp and is doing a great job.  At this price, even the cheapest of cheapskates (which I am) can enjoy the luxury of a new blade every week. I use Proraso Shave Soap and a boar’s hair brush.  I know the different shave soaps will make a huge difference on the closeness of the shave as well.  I am very happy with Astra blades and will more than likely stick with them.  The packaging is great and with 100 blades for a few bucks, it means that I now have enough blades to last me just about 2 years for less than one of those high dollar commercialized disposable razors cost, that you use until you face is bleeding, just to justify the cost.  I love it and wish I would have made this switch a long time ago.</li>
    <li> These blades have worked well so far! Maybe a few nicks but I was still new to shaving with a safety razor.  I have not tried feather blades yet, or any other blades for that matter, so I can&#x27;t compare them to other blades.  But the fact that I dont have to buy any blades for a long long time is great.</li>
    <li> 100 blades for that price can&#x27;t be beat.  I use each blade a couple of times so this pack will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Great blades..wish I had a lighter razor to use them. I should have waited for the razor before I selected the blades, another mistake to add to my web-buying experiences.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality and smoothness of these blades for shaving.  I recently tried a different brand and quickly returned to the Astra SP&#x27;s - the difference was like night and day!  These blades are very forgiving if your technique isn&#x27;t great yet and won&#x27;t nick you like the Feathers or other super sharp blades.  I get a BBS shave with 3 passes easily and very little if any irritation!  You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality!  The shipping was fast and right on time.  Try them out - you&#x27;ll be amazed at the difference they make!</li>
    <li> Last follow up: I moved out of the last place I was living at and I have notice a remarkable difference in my shaving experience... and after a few months I have decided to be fair and ad a last update to my very poor feedback. It seems that I was experiencing a great deal of allergy at the last place I was living at and it directly affected my shaving: These blades may be made out of a Nickel-steel alloy (or another allergenic steel alloy) Hence, whenever I shaved they irritated my skin in a gruesome way generating a multitude of burns and cuts... since i moved out, now my shaving experience has improved dramatically. The blades are not top of the line, but they feel way better. So, if you suffer from allergies don&#x27;t buy these blades. Nevertheless, if you are cleared of allergies these blades may be the best value around, you can shave safely around 4-6 times with each blade if you have sensitive skin and you are hairy. Skin damage is minimum and a close shave can be achieved more or less. Personally, I won&#x27;t buy them again simply because of the allergic reactions described before, but otherwise they are a very good buy.  I placed this last update on top just in case you are not up to reading my whole experience with these blades for the past year or so using them. But if you have the time and are interested about knowing what happens when you allergies and use these blades, you can read my earlier posts below. -------------------------------------------------- I am a hairy person who needs shaving daily. When I was a youngster living in Cuba in the late 80s I had to shave everyday, and I hated it... I always managed to cut my face all over... I used these very brand when it was produced in Czechoslovakia. later on I migrated and started using razors with cartridges that were better but more expensive. Now I decided to save some money and return to the origines in hope that this time the experience had been different... I was wrong: I still hate it... and manage to cut my face all over... the part I hate the most is when I manage to cut myself yet for some god-knows-what-reason there is still hair around and have to pass the razor over the damage area yet a few more times... I will try a different brand, maybe that will help... ------------------------------------------ This is a follow up: my face still hurts from yesterday&#x27;s razor burns and I have to shave again... I guess using a blade more than once is effectively out of the question, and I am wondering how comes this product has so many good reviews... this blades are worst than the original ones I used in the 80s that were branded just &amp;#34;Astra&amp;#34;... now they improved greatly the name adding &amp;#34;superior premium platinum...&amp;#34; I guess to compensate for the huge loss in quality... I read in the web that Gillette bought that factory when Eastern Europe collapsed and moved it to Russia where it seems to be now... problem is that in the 80s in Cuba if you were lucky you could buy some Astras if not you had to buy Russian blades that the people used to say jokingly that were good only to sharpen pencils... so, I guess Russian manufacturing quality has not improved at all... by the way, I thought that first blade I used was the worst blade ever... but after using this second one I have to reckon I was mistaken. Those guys with great reviews talking about these blades are good and can be used 2 or 3 times each must have the face made of stone... ------------------------------------------- This is another follow up: I tried to easy the shaving experience adding baby oil and cocoa butter to see if the blade somehow slipped on my face and didn&#x27;t end up with so much skin irritation, burns, and cuts... I failed miserably. The results remain stubbornly in place. I took a picture in an attempt to show how bad this experience is, but sadly there is no option to add pictures to a review. The main problem with these &amp;#34;razors&amp;#34; is that they are just way too dull. You have to pass more than 10 times over the same spot, thus producing a great deal of skin damage in the process and this is not to get a close shave... with these razors you can confidently forget about having a close shave. After burning and cutting my face all over my face still looks dark from the facial hair and feels like sandpaper... ------------------------------------------- This is another follow up for the gentlemen who left comments and advices regarding how to improve my shaving experience: I have just shaved with Feather razors... there is not even a difference, it is like if we are talking about two completely different things... so,it is definitely the blades: These Astra blades are no good... I have also realized that I could improve my shaving experience if I buy a better handle, better brush, and better cream...  My advice: steer away from these razor blades and pay a little more for better ones... ------------------------------------------- Follow up: I have been shaving with the same Feather blade for the past 3 weeks, and I am starting to wonder if this blade was made to last forever... these blades may costs more, but at the end of the day you will have a way better experience, they will last way longer, and you will end up saving far more money and aggravation...</li>
    <li> I love these blade and for the money, they can&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;ve tried 5 different blades so far (including feather) and these are by far my favorite.  Super sharp and last for four shaves without pulling.  I take one star away for not having plastic blade holder with bank.  The paper packaging while minimal, which I typically like, I have to rely on my other blade packs to dispose of my old Astras.  Bottom line, these blades work best for me.  If you&#x27;re reading reviews deciding which blade to buy next, I would skip the 100 pack, just in case your razor or face don&#x27;t like them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I shave my face and replace the blade weekly.  My wife uses these to shave her legs and will go about a month on a blade.  I have found this one to be the most forgiving and all around easiest to use to get a close shave for an extended time without the nicks and cuts you have from some other safety razor blades.  I tried the sample packs and settled on this brand as best overall.</li>
    <li> In April, I switched over to the dual edge shaver. I was using the Pro-Glide shavers but was going through a cartridge once a week. Money really isn&#x27;t an issue but why waste $4+ a week shaving... Anyhow, I have  a Mercer 34C shaver with Proraso shaving cream. I purchased a DE blade sampler kit but had my heart set on getting the Feather DE blades just because I figured it would be sharper. I have thick facial hair and thought that the \\&quot;sharpest\\&quot; blade would suit me best. Like many of the other reviews, blades work differently for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sampling 5 different DE blades, the Astra blades worked best for me. I never had issues with learning how to wet shave so none of the blades ever marked up my face. But the Astra blades feel the sharpest, closest, smoothest and longest lasting. I shave daily and replace the blade every Sunday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the blade cartridge would have a side that allows you to dispose of the used blades. But like others posted, at a little more than $0.09/blade, who can complain? Instead of spending $16+ a month shaving (and it didn&#x27;t even shave as close), I spend around $0.36/month. How awesome is that?!</li>
    <li> After trying a sampler pack of blades I found that the Astra blades worked very well for me. I have had very few nicks or weepers and I get 3-4 shaves per blade. I have been shaving with a double edge razor for 4 months now and I love it. These were the 6th blade I tried and I get a great shave from them and feel little to no tug till the 4th shave. I use a Merkur long handle razor and an Edwin Jagger DE89L. I would recommend these blades to anyone who has tried several blades first before committing to a pack of 100blades. I also use the feather blades but these are my daily shaver.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor, unless you KNOW you like these, get Derby or Feather. And Feather only if you know they work for your face! You will be changing blades like crazy if you buy these! Yes, they work, they&#x27;re not even that bad, I&#x27;ve just had better shaves from other razors that are around the same price point.</li>
    <li> These are a fairly sharp blade, but do not last more than 1 or 2 shaves with my beard.  Good value and good beginner blade.</li>
    <li> Was not expecting these blades to work nearly as well as they did. I have shaved at least 30 times with the same blade and it shows no sign of dulling. When it runs out I got 99 more of them waiting I the box. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. Fresh, new shave every time for a dime! Never going back to cartridges.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered the 100-pack right after I got my DE razor.  I know that I probably should have started with a sampler, but oh well.  Anyway, after about 8 months of wet shaving with a DE razor, I have used Astra SP, Shark Super Chrome, Derby, and Feather.  The Astra SP&#x27;s are my favorite of the bunch- which is a good thing, considering I have so many of them!  I also like the Feathers; although I don&#x27;t notice a difference in how my face feels afterword as opposed to the Astras.  The main reason(s) why Feather is not my #1 choice is that they are more expensive, and I can only get two good shaves out of them before needing a new blade.  The Astras leave my face silky smooth, and I can typically get 4-6 good shaves out a blade, before needing replacement.  The overall value of the Astra SP&#x27;s is hands-down the best of the bunch.  I get zero tugging or pulling, no irritation, and a close, comfortable shave.  What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: As with most shaving products, this is a YMMV thing.  But for me, the Astras do the job, and they do it very well!</li>
    <li> I have recently returned to double edge shaving after years of overpaying for cartridges.  I became tired of paying so much and filling the landfill with the cartridges, and returned to double edge shaving.  The Astra blades work great, and the price is outstanding.</li>
    <li> My next favorite of DE blades.  This would be my first choice if the Japanese Feather blades were not available.  Very close shaves with all razors I own.</li>
    <li> Great deal for safety razors.  Saves a lot on money if you want to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a DE shaver for just over a year.  The only other razor I&#x27;ve used is the Wilkinson Sword brand.  Based on the high ratings of this blade, I went ahead and ordered the 100 Astra blades and am glad I did.  I believe they are sharper than the Wilkinson&#x27;s and last longer.  A very smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> 4/5 Stars because the blades have a slight inconsistency with them. Its packaged as a box with smaller boxes in it, and in those are the indiviual blades in waxed paper. I love this packaging. The issue is the blades themselves, such as 1/4 blades will be not as sharp and will cause unnecessary pull, cuts, burns that I don&#x27;t get with the rest of the blades.</li>
    <li> I am using a pack of these and wish I listened to people and tried the demos before I got a huge pack.&lt;br /&gt;Astras are well known for being incredibly sharp, and I now know it for myself. I have dry skin around my mouth, so I really have to be careful shaving with these blades. But for cutting sideburns, they go through them like a hot blade through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest people try out demo packs before investing in a single type of blade. But if you are looking for a sharp blade, these are the ones.</li>
    <li> Really great sharp blades. Shaves Really close but be careful when applying any pressure downwards on razor. They really are extremely sharp durable blades.  Worth more than asking price. One box of 100 should last someone a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been DE shaving for 3 years now and really got into it as a college student looking for a cheaper alternative to the expensive cartridge razors. I am currently purchasing my 2nd set of 100 Astra SP blades, almost exactly 2 years after my first box, so that gives you an idea of how long they last/how often I shave. I usually try to switch blades every 3 to 4 shaves, but I have razors that I use for travel and/or keep at home and school, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve gone many more than 4 shaves on some blades without knowing it. Probably less than 5 times have I ever actually noticed that a blade was getting dull and pulling hairs a little, so you could probably carry most blades out to 4+ shaves if you really felt like it, but a $10 investment for 2+ years (still have a few left) isn&#x27;t too bad, even for me. In conclusion, these blades are well worth the money, but as anyone from B&amp;B knows, your mileage may vary. Everyone&#x27;s face reacts differently to certain blades and every blade acts different in each razor. I list the razors I commonly use these blades with below, in addition to other blades I have tried. Take all this for what you paid, as it is just my own unbiased experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors I use with Astra SP blades:&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Tech (WW2 era), Gillette Travel Tech, Gillette Ball-End Tech, 1954 Gillette Super Speed, $2 Rimei razor (off Amazon, great razor for the money IMHO) and I have used a Gillette Slim Adjustable with these blades, though it wasn&#x27;t mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other blade I currently stock for myself is Derby blades. They are definitely not as sharp as Astra SP blades, but that is why I have them. I use them in a Dovo Shavette just because every now and then I like to practice my straight razor technique. The reason I use Derby blades for this is because honestly the Astra SP&#x27;s were too sharp (and my technique sucks), so there was blood. The Derby blades are much more forgiving when using a straight. Don&#x27;t take this to mean that the Astra&#x27;s aren&#x27;t good for beginners, because they are an outstanding beginner blade in a safety razor, just not for a straight...but I don&#x27;t think a \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; straight razor truly exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other blades I&#x27;ve used: (In order of how they compare to Astra SP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra SS&lt;br /&gt;http://amzn.com/B002G2VENC&lt;br /&gt;Felt the same as Astra SP to me, but are always $4-$5 more, so I don&#x27;t see the point...good blades though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather Hi-Stainless&lt;br /&gt;http://amzn.com/B004RWTQTS&lt;br /&gt;Extremely sharp (maybe slightly more than Astra SP), but not as smooth and left a very tiny amount of burn after the shave. Even in my Gillette Ball-End Tech (very mild) these had a little too much \\&quot;bite\\&quot; for me, but a ton of people love them. Honestly, cost was probably a huge factor in trying to find something wrong with these blades, but I really do prefer the Astra blades, regardless of cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby&lt;br /&gt;http://amzn.com/B004SGKMA0&lt;br /&gt;These are not the sharpest blades out there, but they are usually the cheapest. If you are looking for an acceptable shave at the cheapest cost, this is the obvious choice. In my opinion though, you are going to save less than $1 per 100 in comparison to Astra SP blades. If you are like me and a box lasts you 2+ years, then you&#x27;ve saved yourself about 1 cent a week, so you might as well have the best experience you can and go for Astra. I actually use these in my straight, mentioned above, so I don&#x27;t have a problem with these blades, but there is no comparison in terms of sharpness to Astra SP, Astra SS or especially Feather blades. I just prefer a little more sharpness in my safety razor, because I think it translates to a few less passes and slightly less of the hair pulling sensation. Please note, most of my razors are widely considered fairly mild shavers, so the Derby blades might be better in a more aggressive razor, many of which can be found on Amazon in the $30 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personna&lt;br /&gt;http://amzn.com/B0077LAJT2&lt;br /&gt;These blades were fairly sharp and smooth, rivaling the Astra SP, but I had some inconsistency issues with them. I had 25 of these blades that I received from a friend in a trade for Astra&#x27;s and it seemed like 10/25 were much rougher than the rest. It felt like there was a small bur on the blade that I could feel as I shaved. It wasn&#x27;t a horrible sensation, I could just feel that something was rubbing in a tiny little area, though I couldn&#x27;t see any blade imperfections. I know it was the blade edge, because if I flipped the razor over to the other side, it felt fine. This happened on a few different razors. Eventually I started using these in my Dovo shavette because I could break off the half of the blade that caused the problem. This experience may have just been a weird batch and I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t a common thing, at least I hope not, but it was enough to turn me off. For what it&#x27;s worth, I have heard that there is a medical quality version of this blade that is very highly rated, though I don&#x27;t think it is available on Amazon (they need to fix that!), so they might be worth finding some day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilkinson Sword&lt;br /&gt;http://amzn.com/B000GCSFWW&lt;br /&gt;Honestly my least favorite blade that I&#x27;ve tried, these came with my Dovo Shavette (I think). They seem to have about the same sharpness as a Derby blade, but they didn&#x27;t feel smooth at all. It was like I could feel and hear the blade cutting through each individual hair. I used the 5 that I had (at least 2 in my safety razors) and never considered them again. These are the only blades on this list that I actually recommend avoiding, but once again, that is just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background Info (for the few that made it this far):&lt;br /&gt;I have a coarse beard and shave 2-3 times a week usually. I try to always shave after taking a shower, but sometimes in a rush I just shave in the shower using only the water and I&#x27;ve never had any problems. When I&#x27;m not rushed, I use Van der Hagen Deluxe shave soap, which is definitely on the cheap end, but I don&#x27;t have any problem with it whatsoever! It has a very mild soap scent, which I like because I would rather smell like my cologne then my shaving soap...just my personal preference. I have tried the red and the white Proraso soaps available on Amazon. They were great, but you just can&#x27;t beat the &lt;$2 price of the Van der Hagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this was helpful! I&#x27;m sure a ton of veteran shavers agree and disagree with what I&#x27;ve said, but this is my fairly unbiased opinion of the products I&#x27;ve tried. Everyone&#x27;s face is different, but when I give a gift to a friend who becomes interested after seeing my vintage razors (definite cool factor shaving with a 70+ year old piece of equipment), you don&#x27;t want to spend a ton on something when there&#x27;s a good chance they may not take to the hobby, yes shaving can become a hobby. The beginner kit I build usually includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra SP blades (usually a 5 pack is enough to see if someone is gonna stick with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van der Hagen Shave Set (includes the soap I use, as well as a bowl and brush)&lt;br /&gt;http://amzn.com/B001A3HPT0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rimei $2 Razor (listed as Rosalinni, but you&#x27;ll get a Rimei usually)&lt;br /&gt;http://amzn.com/B0050HO9MI&lt;br /&gt;Great beginner razor, comparable to Gillette Tech. The build quality is pretty good, but I know there are at least 3 different versions of the Rimei going around. One is a 4-piece, while the other two are 3-piece razors. I have never encountered the 4-piece, but both 3-piece razors are good. If you can figure out which one a seller offers, try to get the 3-piece with cross-hatching on the handle, as opposed to the one with a mainly vertical-lined handle, because it has a better finish and grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope all this was helpful!</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp giving me a close shave. Much better than the Derby blades I had before. I do wish that this came with a place to store used blades.</li>
    <li> These razors work very well.  I have used the Derbee brand razors, and these by far work head and shoulders better.</li>
    <li> Great blades, really sharp and each blade lasted almost a week.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but seems to be okay.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to blade for some time now. I have tried others and they work well, but the astras seem to be right for my facial hairs thickness. With 3 passes I have a baby smooth shave. I generally get 4-5 shaves out of one blade.. That is with pre-shave oil, shaving creme, and rinsing between each stroke. Considering the price per blade, this 100 pack of astras is hard to beat!!! Join the club and say goodbye to 4 or 5 blade cartridges!</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all. Duller than the entry level Derby blade.  Took multiple passes to shave and caused lots of razor burn.</li>
    <li> I for one was so tired of overpaying for cheap disposable razors, so I made the move to a double edge safety razor. This product is great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. You won&#x27;t find a cheaper shave!</li>
    <li> These are nice razors. They come in smaller packs of 5 inside so they are easy to divide up or put where you need to.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with these blades.  I still have a stubble after I shave.  They are not sharp.  Also, they come in paper boxes with no where to store your used blades.  I had Derby blades before and they are much better.  They have a plastic container that holds the blades and also it stores the used blades safely.</li>
    <li> Great price, we bought these over a year ago and my husband still has a lot.</li>
    <li> Not a Sharp as expected. Expect to use multiple blades when shaving coarse beards.</li>
    <li> Considering the good quality and amount for the price it&#x27;s a very good deal.I get a weeks worth of shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Talk about a smooth shave! These blades work great!  the only con if any is that the package doesn&#x27;t have a place to put the used blades. Just make sure you save the new blade wrapper to wrap the old blade before discarding.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a GREAT razor, but I took one star away because of the logo print that&#x27;s slightly visible once applied to my Merkur 34C razor. If Astra would simply print their design just a tad towards the inside of the blade, there wouldn&#x27;t be any black ink visible after installing it onto your razor. Besides that one small complaint, it&#x27;s a fantastic razor.</li>
    <li> These blades seem very sharp.  Great in many of my razors.</li>
    <li> I use these and the Feather blades.  Both products are excellent, and maybe, just maybe the Feathers are a tiny bit better, but these are the best value.  It&#x27;s hard to beat a 100 blades at 10 bucks, and the quality of the blades are excellent.  I have very coarse hair and very sensitive skin, and these work great for me for about four days.  For others these could go a week or longer.</li>
    <li> I have used about 15 of these razors so far. They are great razors. I can finally justify using a blade once or twice and replacing. I used to spend a ton of money on the &amp;#34;Mach 673&amp;#34; style cartridges. NO MORE! Save yourself the money and switch to a real man&#x27;s razor. Even the &amp;#34;Dollar Shave Club&amp;#34; prices are nothing compared to a single blade price.</li>
    <li> I sampled a 100-pack of several different brands of blades.  Out of all of them, my favorite was the Astra Platinum.  Now I buy 100-packs of these.  They&#x27;re fairly cheap too.</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the people online, I do not notice a huge difference between blades.  That being said some are better than others and these have been a solid performer for me in both my Edwin Jagger as well as my Merkur slant.  I had originally ordered a sample pack off of Amazon including: Derby, Shark, Feather, etc.....  And personally liked these the best.  Using my slant I can get a weeks worth of single to double pass shaves out of them.</li>
    <li> Good quality, and I recommend them. However, once I discovered Feather blades, nothing else would do. I get 3 good shaves out of an Astra blade, which isn&#x27;t bad, and the shave is comfortable.</li>
    <li> These blades provide the best shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Great blades. I do not shave much of my face, just my neck line, so for me these work perfectly and the price is right.</li>
    <li> great blades...package will probably last two years</li>
    <li> Works great with the razor</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp, well packaged. makes for a good shave, great value for the money. Far cheaper then multiple blade replacement blade cartridges.</li>
    <li> Blades are fairly sharp out of the box. They shave really well the first day, but don&#x27;t do well unless they are tightly secured in your razor. They don&#x27;t knick often. At the price I got them, one or two shaves per blade is best for your face. They come in little paper packs of 5 inside the carton which is handy for overnight trips.</li>
    <li> I am not a newbie when it comes to shaving with Safety razors but honestly I have not shaved with such a quality razor blade before. When I passed the blade a third time on the same area I didn&#x27;t expect the irritation I was just accustomed to multiple passes, Needless to say I used my styptic pencil a good bit.I usually bought my razors at a local beauty supply store but they stopped carrying individual razor blades so I turned to Amazon and tried these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fantastic blades that will last me a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> great buy and always getting a great shave now</li>
    <li> Tried them all and this is the only blade I use very high quality.</li>
    <li> Very close shave with the Proraso shaving cream. I am new to  using DE safety  razors after so many years with an electric. I have found the combo that works with me.</li>
    <li> These are superior blades in every sense than what you find in the stores!! They have lasted for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good set of blades that provides several shaves before becoming dull. Tons of high quality blades for the money. I&#x27;d recommend buying and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These are super sharp and I love how they dispense at the bottom of the package.</li>
    <li> Great quality and perfect sharpness for someone without a lot of safety razor experience.</li>
    <li> Good blades but they seem to dull quickly. Given the price they&#x27;re a good deal though!</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of double edge razor blades but I prefer this brand . I can use one blade to shave three times and still get a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Ignore the Dollar Shave Club. Cry foul on the lies perpetuated by Gillette and Schick. Buy yourself an old-school safety razor and a box of these blades and you&#x27;re set for the next year (or more, if you&#x27;re like me and just use the razor to shape up a full beard). Not only do they shave more comfortably and precisely, but they&#x27;re more durable and a hell of a lot cheaper. So keep your silly nano blades with useless lubrication strips and array of 5 laser aligned $16 razors. Instead, follow these easy steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Put razor blade on safety razor&lt;br /&gt;2) Wet face with as hot water (or hot towel) as you can stand, ideally immediately after a shower to soften the whiskers and open pores&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply the pre-shave oil of your choice&lt;br /&gt;4) Apply the shaving cream of your choice (ideally with a shaving brush used in a circular motion to get those whiskers standing tall and proud)&lt;br /&gt;5) Make with the shaving&lt;br /&gt;6) Rinse&lt;br /&gt;7) Apply post shave product of your choice - preferably something that stinks all pretty like&lt;br /&gt;8) Rejoice in your new shaving ritual that not only shaves better, but also more cheaply, than ever before</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for over 20+yrs using Gillette carts. Every time they release a new product I have been switching to them and it kept leaving my wallet thin. The shave quality I recieved from carts has been very bad. After lot of research I switched to Double Edge and has been shaving with Merkurs for a while now. After seeing the price of these Astra&#x27;s I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regular prep I started shaving with these Astra, surprisingly these blades gave me the best shave of my life. My wife also had compliments about my facial skin. I&#x27;m going to stock up these Astras.</li>
    <li> Good enough.  Great value.</li>
    <li> These are cheap and they work great!</li>
    <li> Great blades, they came in two seperate boxes and then seperated in different doxes of ten, I thought this was an over kill on the packaging at first but after acouple monthes it turned out great.  I have 1000 blades and will probably last the rest the rest of my life. I am getting about 15 shaves per blade.  I  flip the blade every other shave to help with wear.  I don&#x27;t get any razor bumps or burns with these blades</li>
    <li> Astra Superior Platinums are widely regarded among the internet shaving forums as a very well rounded, great performing blade. It&#x27;s not the best in any single category, but it&#x27;s darn good in all categories. Coupled with the price (around 10 cents a blade regularly here on amazon), the Astra SP is the go-to blade for a huge population of wet shavers. To put it into perspective....the ultra-sharp and ultra-aggressive feather blade favored by a lot of experienced users goes for about 30 cents a blade (on a good day)....and they last about half as long as an Astra SP. They may be sharper, but the Astra SP is sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip- The Astras are packaged with 4 little wax spots on one side of the blade to secure it to the wrapper. What I usually do if the wax has overflown onto the blade edge itself is to install the blade in the razor, then run it under the hottest water possible to melt the wax. What doesn&#x27;t melt can be wiped off by running the razor in reverse over a towel (BE VERY CAREFUL - DO NOT ATTEMPT IF YOU DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT I&#x27;M TALKING ABOUT. YOU WILL HURT YOURSELF AND WE WILL ALL LAUGH).</li>
    <li> They were as advertised and came in a timely manner</li>
    <li> Updated 2016  I had to update my review from a few years ago. After trying several other brands, I keep coming back to the Astra.  I can confidently say these are the best blades I have found.  I must admit it did take a few weeks to adjust to shaving with a safety razor and a new blade but please save your money and don&#x27;t waste it by trying another brands.  Shaving is like art, it takes patience and you will develop your own style and technique.  My biggest advice when using these blades, is 1. Use as little pressure as possible. 2.  Rinse the blade after every stroke.  Original Review.  I recently tried the Astra superior premium blades after using the Derby blades for a few months.  At first I was very impressed in how smooth a shave you get with these blades.  To be honest, you really can&#x27;t even tell you have a blade in your shaver.  However, feeling my skin after the shave I can tell it wasn&#x27;t as close a shave as the Derby blades. In fact, I noticed I had more irritation and bleeding compared to the Derby blades when everything else is kept the same (preshave oil, preshave lotion etc..).  For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong to try them as everyone&#x27;s skin type is different; However, another drawback even though small is that each blade is packaged separately with paper and you have no container to place the used blades.  That might be a safety issue if you have children or even emptying trash unlike the Derby brand that come in a plastic container for easy disposal of used blades.</li>
    <li> I just started using these blades and so far they seem fine, probably of equal quality to a Japanesse brand I have previously purchased,so far , so good ...,</li>
    <li> The only blades, in my experience, that top these are the Feather blades - but at 3 times the price! These are perfect. It&#x27;s true that every face works differently, so look around and find what works for you. These work with my face, and probably will with yours too. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It has been a while since I received this item. I have to say that the blades are great. My husband&#x27;s bears is thick with curly hair and he gets a close shave without having to pay a month worth of salary for replacement cartridge like other brands.</li>
    <li> While the blade does all that is advertized, I found myself changing blades after only two shaves, where with the Treet platinum blades, I could go a full 6-7 shaves. Still a good buy at 100 blades, but for a 50-pack, i would most likely choose a different model. The wax drops on the blades, or the wrapping style on the paper, did not bother me at all, and did not interfere with function in the least. Decent product.</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research before choosing this particular DE blade. I found them to be sharper than I expected. I made the switch to come back to my original shaving setup with these blades simply because the razor blade industry out-priced themselves with all the super-modern shaving inventions. I now find that my shaving is exceptionally closer with Astra and I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
    <li> These blades work the best value for the money in my situation, there are sharper blades but that isn&#x27;t always best. I didn&#x27;t get razor burn and can get about 3 shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> This fit great, last a decent amount of time. You really can&#x27;t beat these for the price. We are saving so much on razors, and this pack is seriously several years worth of blades!!</li>
    <li> After shaving 4 times I really like these blades. I have used others over the past few years that were good but these are the best yet. They are very sharp so be careful not good for a first time user.</li>
    <li> Not everyone will have similar experiences with the same blade. I shave everyday and have been really impressed by these blades.  I used to get a lot of razor burn due to shaving everyday but after switching to these blades I have been experiencing fewer burns. I would say buy a few samples and try different blades and go with the one that suits you the most.</li>
    <li> whoa! there are like tiny little frikkin ninja stars! except you shave with them and only use them once or two times!</li>
    <li> Good blades, adequately sharp, but forgiving- good for people with sensitive skin.  Four stars because they don&#x27;t last but 3-4 shaves.  For the price though, (approx 10 cents/blade when purchased in bulk) I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best blades that I have ever tried, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> super sharp and economical. I think I never run out of this box since I use each razor for two weeks!!</li>
    <li> Sharp quality blades, great bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad for a year&#x27;s supply for around 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> Some seem to be too sharp and cause some irritation, quality is excellent if sharpness was more consistent from blade to blade.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best blades for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way they shave</li>
    <li> Sharp, affordable, they do the job without breaking the piggy-bank.</li>
    <li> Great razors!!!!! Great Price!!!!</li>
    <li> Good blades will order more</li>
    <li> Granted everyone is going to like a different blade for different reasons but for me, these Astra Superior Platinum work the best for me as far as closeness of cut (With the least amount of passes), consistency with the blades, irritation level &amp; less face cuts. Normally I shave every day but for times when I have to go two or three days in between shaves, these still out performed all other blades I have tried. I bought a few sample packs which included -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shark (These were the most irritating on my skin),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trig (Don&#x27;t get these! Maybe it&#x27;s what I got but all the blades in the sample pack had bent corners redering them useless!!! Good thing I caught that otherwise my face would have been torn up!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette (Blades didn&#x27;t perform consistently for me, seemed to need more passes for a clean shave which just irritates my skin),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personna (These were the second best in the sample packs for me and I would buy these if I couldn&#x27;t get the Astra ones.),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby (Also a good clean cut but again, seemed to irritate my skin even with just one pass.),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather (These were OK but again, they seemed to take more passes with this brand than with any other to get a clean shave.),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and of course Astra (The ones I decided to stick with since they seemed to be the most consistent with quality, smoothness of cut with fewer passes and with the least amount of skin irritation.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advise for DE users is to always try a sample set first to see which ones work best for your wiskers and just go with it!</li>
    <li> Great price. And great blades. Years worth of blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands and these work for me. I probably have a mid range beard and with these blades I never feel any resistance when shaving. Sharper than mercur and personna, but not as sharp as feather blades. Very consistent, I&#x27;ve already used 100 of these. Cheap enough that I switch blades every other shave. They will usually hold up for up to 4-5 shaves before I start getting several nicks. Like everyone says, a blade is a personal choice and everyone is different.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave every time! These blades are a favorite; they last for a good amount of shaves too.</li>
    <li> So Cheap! And great quality as well, you cant go wrong buying this. Perfect for any double sided safety razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used three different types of blades. Some were more expensive but are the same quality as these. The more expensive ones have two sleeves covering each blade, but that&#x27;s truly the only difference I see and feel.</li>
    <li> If you have thick, coarse facial hairs this blade will work well. However, I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the pack of 100. I find myself wanting to change the blades out after 3 shaves because it doesn&#x27;t feel like they glide well after that. I think I&#x27;ll try the feather blades next as they&#x27;re supposed to be the sharpest around.</li>
    <li> These blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as the ones that came with my feather double edge.  However its not all bad, since there is less likelihood of slicing and dicing my face.  I find that for the closest cut I need to replace the blade every 2-3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really much a problem since I have 100 blades!  Overall this is a great value, which is why I decided to start shaving with a double edge razor in the first place.</li>
    <li> My husband was not able to use these without cutting himself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Astra blades in conjunction with Proraso shave soap and so far my face has been smoother than ever. The blades are sharp but don&#x27;t tear my face up, I can usually go one pass with the grain then one against the grain and I&#x27;m good to go. It&#x27;s worth noting a razor that works for one person may not work for another and I took a hell of a risk buying 100 without trying them out but it paid off. If this blade works for you it&#x27;s an amazing deal.</li>
    <li> Thankful i can still find these safety razor blades somewhere! Wally world stopped carrying them, and i&#x27;m not going back to paying $30 for 3 razors that are unnecessarily complicated in design to just shave hair.  This nice cheap 100 razor pack could possibly last me years. I hope they still sell them at that point!</li>
    <li> Made in Russia is what my box says. This, flexible blades. Packed in packs of five blades. Individually double wrapped. Little dots of some glue hold the inner paper to the blade. If it bothers you rub it off, it&#x27;s not on the cutting edge, so it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
    <li> These are an above average shave for me.  Better than most but not the ultra top of the line.  The price for what I got was a very good value.</li>
    <li> So far these razor blades have worked well. I tend to rotate them around every 3-4 days so as to not cause discomfort. All and all a good buy.</li>
    <li> This a very sharp blade and keeps the cut real smooth... I really enjoy using these razor blades a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought a 50 pack of various blades from Amazon a few months ago, and made notes along the way to help me find the balde I wanted to re-purchase.  This came out on top, as well as the non-platinum.  I just bought the 100 pack a week ago, knowing it&#x27;s one of the best blades for me.  If you have not already tried a variety pack to help steer your choice, I&#x27;d suggest doing that before buying a hundred of anything.</li>
    <li> Cheap blades that work well enough though not as good as Feather blades for me.</li>
    <li> These were the first blades I bought so I don&#x27;t have any basis for comparison.  The price was good and they seem to stay sharp enough (about 2-3 shaves).</li>
    <li> Great blade for heavy handed or beginner shavers. I started out with shark blades. Then moved on to Feathers because of all the hype and carved up my face, razor burn and cuts from hell. I went to these for a few months while I got acquainted with my new razor because these blades had good reviews. They are good and sharp. The main plus is they are more forgiving that Feathers because they aren&#x27;t as sharp. Feathers are insanely sharp, these are very sharp and a better choice for those just starting out or heavy handed guys that get a lot of razor burn.</li>
    <li> how can beat the per shave price? i mean really!!  no trac 27 blades for me : )  shave live a man ; )</li>
    <li> Not very sharp at all. Can get about two poor shaves out of them before I have to change blades.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> this is my second buy of 100 count astra blades.  the first one took about 3 years to finish off.  i shave my head and face.  the blades aren&#x27;t the sharpest but are definitely smooth.  would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a good blade....I gave it four stars because it is a four star blade.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sharp and gives a BBS (baby butt smooth) shave.I find that blades&lt;br /&gt;work differently in each model of razor. These are good for me.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and trouble free. It is very likely that I will&lt;br /&gt;use these in the far future as my \\&quot;GO to\\&quot;blades.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use with my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor and they work great together! Although this is my first blade I think I&#x27;ll try the ultra thin next to see if they work any better. It&#x27;s hard to believe they will without taking off a couple layers of skin. LOL.</li>
    <li> If you use a safety razor, get these! Unbelievably sharp resulting in an incredibly close and amazing shave. Since I have a beard and only shave to neaten up and keep lines clean these will last me for a substantial amount of time, and could not believe the price!</li>
    <li> These are good blades and an economical way to buy them.  I still think Japanese Feathers are sharper but way too expensive, so these are a good choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for the better part of a year now on a Parker 91R and I really like them. Flipping the blade after each shave I would say I get about 6 really high quality shaves out of one of these blades, though my hair is not super dense. After 6 I generally switch to avoid scratches and rashes from dull blades. The only downside preventing 5 stars is that the packaging of each individual blade includes some glue that interferes with one edge of the blade on maybe 1 out of 10 blades.</li>
    <li> I have been using various Schick and Gillette cartridge products for over 20 years and decided I want to try something different now. I bought a full kit for DE shaving - [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]], [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]], [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shave Soap, Sensitive, 150ml/5.2 oz (147 g) Jar]] and finally, [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the blade that came with the razor for about 8 shaves and then switched to the Astra. As another reviewer has pointed out, there is a bit of glue residue at times while opening the blade wrapper. But this normally doesn&#x27;t affect the edge as much. My experience so far after using 4 blades has been a bit underwhelming. The shave isn&#x27;t as smooth as the one with the original Merkur blade and I barely get about 4-5 shaves. I have been consistent with the method so that other factors are eliminated or minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while disappointed with the shave quality, I am still rating this at 4-stars mainly for the price. This is definitely a huge value for the money but I will probably try other brands before coming back to Astra in the future.</li>
    <li> This product works well for scoring bread and holds a sharp edge, however it has 2 sticky spots when you peel the protective paper off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through more than a dozen DE blade brands, and Astra is emerging as my favorite. While others may advertise as sharper or smoother, I have yet to find a blade that delivers the performance, value, and comfort that Astra does. I&#x27;m currently using it with a Dreadnought Spartan Razor, and the combination of the two is giving me excellent-to-flawless shaves every time, without going over the same spots too many times (although I do follow the WTG/XTG/ATG plus touch-up beard reduction routine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of longevity, at pennies per blade, I don&#x27;t feel too bad about using each three times and discarding - particularly with my tough-as-nails beard. But I am fairly confident I could get more shaves out of each blade if I really needed to. Others have advertised longer blade life, so as we all like to say (ad nauseum), \\&quot;your mileage may vary.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly believe this is a forgiving enough blade for beginners but will also reward the long-time shaver who can get close shaves with an aggressive razor.</li>
    <li> Bought these off the recommendation of the Wicked Edge community on Reddit.  Glad that I did, they are extremely sharp and well packaged.  Each blade is individually wrapped to ensure a good edge and so that they won&#x27;t rust on the shelf in a steamy bathroom.  Buying in bulk saves a ton of cash and the box is so small it takes up no space, maybe 1 x 4 x .5, something like that.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> These blades are a revelation. I had been using Feather razor blades (http://www.amazon.com/Feather-Razor-Blades-Hi-Stainless-Double/dp/B001G5FOLI/) with my safety razor and have been super happy with them, but I decided to try Astra because they are super inexpensive. Here are my initial impressions after four shaves:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Good shave; comparable to the Feather&lt;br /&gt;- The heft of the blade seems to shave better with the grain&lt;br /&gt;- .10 per blade is a great deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The heft of the razor seemed to nick me a little more against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said, this is my new blade of choice. I will definitely reorder these in a year or so when I get through these hundred.</li>
    <li> Everything others have said is true. I believe the Personna is smoother and better when starting but these are a must have regardless. I&#x27;m very happy I purchased them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about 75% of the blades so I thought it was time for a review, so far I&#x27;ve only tried Feather and Derby double edge razor blades.  The Feather blades are, as you may all know the most praised when it comes to how sharp they are, they are indeed very very sharp but a tad bit rough from my experience.  The Astra blades are not as sharp as the Feather but are much smoother, they give an excellent shave, I actually prefer them to the Feather blades since they&#x27;re cheaper.  One thing that may bother some people is that the blades have glue dots on them, although I have found that it doesn&#x27;t diminish the quality of the shave in any way some people might find this irritating.  Still, given the value and excellent performance of the blades I won&#x27;t knock down a star for that tiny issue.  The durability is normal, I shave every two days or so but I immediately notice they become less smooth after about the second or third shave, but you do get 100 so you&#x27;re supposed to change them often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Derby blades, I tried the ones that came with my Edwin Jagger 89lbl and they sucked so much that I ended up given most of them to a friend, which also hated them and I felt bad so I gave him some Astra blades to try and he loved them.</li>
    <li> I tried these from my usual feather razor blades.  I didn&#x27;t feel these were sharp enough for my liking.  They had too much of a pulling feeling for me.  I prefer the Feather razor blades to these.</li>
    <li> These blades are SHARP! they last for about five good shaves and for the price I certainly wont complain - I will buy more when I run out (but that wont be any time soon)</li>
    <li> Blades are awesome, but they are in a cardboard box.  I wish they had a hard container to dispose of the used blades in.  However, I use a sharps container in the house for needles, so it&#x27;s a moot point for me.  I just put the used razors in the sharps container and their safe to dispose of.</li>
    <li> I want to say first that I have very sensitive skin, but I have purchased other blades that don&#x27;t cause irritation like these do.</li>
    <li> These are good blades, they are as durable and have as good of edge as anything in this price range.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> A good razor and decent blades will treat you good believe me you just have to find what works for you!</li>
    <li> Works great a razor is a razor to me. Gets the job done. It&#x27;s nice to buy a large amount for such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Moved to double edge shaving - after getting frustrated with the ever increasing world of multi blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few weeks to get used to shaving without multi (I think, the only real edge multi blades have over this is that you can shave more casually - multi blade is more forgiving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other blade I can compare it with is Feather, and I prefer this to feather.</li>
    <li> Just what&#x27;s needed for a safety razor. Easy to use and gives a nice smooth shave. Good price, good value.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample pack I used merkur feather derby and these were the best for me maybe for you maybe not (DE) shaving is the best</li>
    <li> I switched to a double edged safety razor and bought these to go with it, I&#x27;ll never go back to my electric or disposables. These end up being so much cheaper than anything else and they perform so, so much better than any other form of shaving I&#x27;ve tried. Be careful taking the razors out of their wrappers; they are SHARP!</li>
    <li> 20 packages of 5&lt;br /&gt;Each blade individually wrapped&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp&lt;br /&gt;Fits well in my cheap razor&lt;br /&gt;2-3 shaves on each blade&lt;br /&gt;smooth shaves each time</li>
    <li> because the product are good quality does better then other razors. it shaves closer then other razor blades. better then expected</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome for blades. It&#x27;s sharp as hell and gets the job done. I have noticed that there are numbers in the corner just in case you don&#x27;t want to use the same blade side twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other thing is that the glue they use to secure the razor on the paper is really sticky. I don&#x27;t know if you care about that or not.</li>
    <li> I use these in my $20 purchased-from-target Van der Hagen razor.  These work better than the 5-pack that came with the razor.  No issues with razor burn or nicking.  (The included Van der Hagen blades always generated nicks on my throat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good close shave, blades made in Russia, exceedingly inexpensive.  I will absolutely buy again, once I run out of them.  (so far, I&#x27;ve gotten 8 shaves out of the first blade.  Your mileage may vary, I do have a light beard.)</li>
    <li> The first shave I had with these cut me up pretty bad, but every shave since has been flawless. I don&#x27;t know if my skin just had to adjust or what, but I love these blades and my Shaving Factory Double Edged Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding a blade that was sharp enough to cut my coarse facial hair but not so sharp that it didn&#x27;t slice me to shreds. These blades seem to be perfect for me! Two to three passes with these and my face is baby smooth with minimal to no cuts!! I imagine I won&#x27;t have to buy blades for well over a year with this 100 pack. Excellent value!!</li>
    <li> I have been using DE blades for several years in a variety of handles ranging from vintage Gillette to modern Merkur slants.  I have bought several sample packs of various blades and used dozens of various brands.  The Astra Platinum gives a consistently close, smooth shave with no tugging, or &amp;#34;weepers&amp;#34;.  They are a fraction of the cost of many other brands and unlike some brands the quality remains the same.  I will keep looking for a better blade, but I doubt I will ever find one.</li>
    <li> These blades aren&#x27;t all that great.  They pull and cause lots of irritation on my face.  Using them on my stomach and chest they aren&#x27;t bad but i will only keep 20 maybe and sell the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just weren&#x27;t for me but they might be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Wilkinson Sword and Feather blades is you want a sharper blade which is what I like.</li>
    <li> I am revising an earlier review as I have just finished shaving with the same Astra blade for the 18th day in a row.  Still close and smooth and without nubs, or burls.  These blades are far superior to the Feather or any of the highly touted blades.  The price is right and the product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance at one point about six months ago.  I had been trying every blade in order to find the best blade for the two razors (Merkur and Jagger), had tried a number of soaps and creams, and saw the bargain100 blade offer and thought, \\&quot;what the heck!\\&quot;.  I was not only pleasantly surprised by the shaves these blades provided, but once I got the kind of soap down (shifting from the Taylor of Bond Street creams, which are fine and smell great) to the Omega Eucalyptus (also smells great, about 10.00, and provides a smoother shave, and then to the Wilkinson Shaving soap bowl, also great smell, even smoother, and about 6.00.  The Astra blades LAST... I can get a good shave for up to ten or twelve days and I have a pretty rough beard.  I am a total fan and hope others take advantage of this great option and leave the supposedly superior blades to others.</li>
    <li> These blades are fantastic. I own the micro touch one razor because its good quality, and not aggressive, great razor. However the dorco blades that come with it are not so great, they are dull, not very smooth, and they dont even after 4 passes get me very smooth. They also charge 8 dollars for 12 blades or 75 cents per blade. These blades are sharp, smooth, and after 2 passes give me a great shave. In addition they are 10 dollars for 100 blades or 10 cents per blade. They are cheaper than the micro touch one blades, by about 7.5 x cheaper, and they give me a far better shave.</li>
    <li> Tried several different blades, and this one is my favorite so far!  The only dislike is the individual wrappings and can leave some residue, not a problem though.</li>
    <li> I tried to get a close shave with this.  I used as directed. I spent plenty of time (more than I usually would with my fusion pro-glide).  The razor misses hair and I have to double/triple/quadruple shave.  I then can&#x27;t get it close.  I feel hair stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then take my regular razor (fusion pro-glide) and I can easily shave in just a few seconds to clean it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see how people say that it is a closer shave.  I tried to investigating if I was doing something wrong but...  Can&#x27;t htet it to work.</li>
    <li> I ordered these blades from Boco Deals (great service by the way).I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some different blades so I thought I would give these a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. To put it simple for the money these are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.Try them and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Absolutely tore my face up.  Worst shaving experience of my life.  Have 99 left to give or throw away.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> These are great blades, just sharp enough that you can get a handful of quality shaves out of them without cutting or burning your face.  Not as sharp as the feathers, but I feel they last for more quality shaves. I would compare them to the med preps, but maybe slightly less sharp. They work great with my ikon slant.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. I do think these blades a little duller than my old brand - the one with the two swords in the picture, but they shave fine. Razor burn may be a a little worse. It&#x27;s great to buy this many at a time and not have to worry about it though.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers I have become increasingly frustrated with the decreasing low-quality shave of multi-blade razors. I spent 6 months trying every single multi-blade razor. These razors remove the shaving cream before eliminating the hair tips. They leave a frustrating choice between pushing the blades against the bare skin, and getting  a rash, or keeping a sandpaper face. I decided to try a third choice: return to safety razor, after over 30 years of plastics, and was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Astra blades are terrific. They leave my face smooth after 1-2 passes.  I did not have any cuts, bruises or scratches, for several months, since I switched to safety razor.  The Atra blades can last for 3-5 shaves, but they are priced so low that you can change the blade with every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for mulit-blade razors.  Razor companies  make more money by  increasing the number of blades, to max price, while reducing their sharpness, to minimize.  It is only a matter of time before we see a 10-blade razor that can barely remove the shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Not bad and economical.  Smooth, fast, very light pressure and no cuts.  Works well in Merkur 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> IMO, they are better than Derby (sharper and still forgiving). I can have 4 shaves with each blade. They don&#x27;t pull whiskers ~10 cents each blade and pretty darn good shave.</li>
    <li> A years worth of blades for half the price of a pack of four Mach 4 blades.  What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> For me these provide a great shave and they are a great price. Would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades for the money. Feathers are a little sharper, but their price tag isn&#x27;t really worth it when compared to the Astra&#x27;s. If money is no object, go with Feathers. If you&#x27;re budget-minded, go with the Astra&#x27;s. Both will get the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought the 100 pack of the Astra platinum blades 3 years ago when I switched from cartridge to double edged shaving.  Admittedly, I do not have a heavy beard...but i do shave every day.  I&#x27;ve used 50 of the blades in the 3 years.  I get a close, comfortable shave from these and have had no problems with them at all.  (Like others have said:  &amp;#34; Your mileage may vary&amp;#34;)  Every time my wife and I go to Costco and I see the price of those multi-blade cartridges, I just have to shake my head.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what I was looking for. I use to use my late fathers straight razor when I started out shaving and buying cheap BIC throw away razors was a waste of money and never really shaved close enough. Now I have a complete set to last forever.</li>
    <li> for the money these are in my opinion one of the best if not the best de blades you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smooth, close shaves, no irritation for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at this price certainly worth a try</li>
    <li> I recently got into DE shaving, so I haven&#x27;t tried many brands of blades, but these seem to work great for me. I have had no problem with them. I love that they are all individually wrapped and and razor sharp at a price less than $0.10 a piece. I can probably get two shaves off one blade, so they should last forever.</li>
    <li> Take some getting used to(very sharp) but very nice and smooth shave. Would buy again and again, nothing like a straight razor.</li>
    <li> My main mistake was this buying the 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor blades ya 100 blades for under 10 bucks what a bargain. And they worked out great for me after all. For me a nick free close shave i got what i wanted. I just missed out on trying all the different brands in the sampler pack, but were sold out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Might give gf the shaving bug, and get a jagger and some samples blades. With a razor this nice i wonder why i moved away from this type of razor.&lt;br /&gt;To anybody even slightly interested count up the cost for a year. W/a DE razor you will save money. Do a bit more homework first don&#x27;t just buy a ton of blades because they were cheap. I got lucky and the blades worked for me. Then take the plunge. With all your shaving gear. You just might find your better half wanting to use it too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true... blades are mostly preference. With that said though I felt these blades seemed more cheaply made than other blades I have used. The packaging for individual blades was defiantly cheaper but the price was cheaper so I will cut off my complaints there and give this product 4 stars for it&#x27;s price point alone. I will not point out the quality of the shave because again this type of product just works so widely different from person to person. The best bit of advice I can give is buy a variety pack and find what works best for you and your safety Razor because even having a different model safety razor varies the performance of the blade. Happy hunting and good luck!... My search continues for the ultimate shave.. the shave that brings back infantile memories before life became so hairy... le sigh.</li>
    <li> These razors will do the job they need to on your face.  They are very sharp, but glide over your skin&lt;br /&gt;like they are silk.  Unfortunately, they dull fast;  However, if you buy them in a 100 pack carton, they cost about $9.00, a tremendous bargain.  They are much cheaper than Feather or Bic razors and do the same job, just don&#x27;t last as long.  What have you got to lose?  Go get yourself a pack of Astras and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> At 9 bucks a for a hundred blades these are a bargain, but these are smoother shavers than the Feathers I was using and are less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two boxes and I am not having to buy blades for a few years.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor, and purchased the 100 blade count Astra Superior Premium Platinum double edge blades to go along with it... I got word from hubby from the other side of the globe that these blades are amazing! He said they provide a super close shave without much effort at all, and he will never go back to the &amp;#34;leading  name brand 4 and 5 blade&amp;#34; disposable type again. This not only gives a better shave leaving the skin baby smooth, but will save a lot of money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every blade that is readily available such as Feather Hi-stainless, Treet, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock, Personna, Derby, Dorco, Lord, Sharks, etc and have found the Astra SP to the be the one I prefer...not too sharp, but still last 5 to 6 shaves.  I bought a box almost 2-years ago!  They cost around 3 to 5 cents each depending on how many shaves you get and for around $10 they lasted 18 months with daily shaving!  THAT is a Bargain !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with an old Gillette Superspeed razor and drug store blades for many years.  After shaving with the disposable multi-blade Mach 3 or whatever, discovering the pleasure of a real shave with a warm boar brush, soap and blade is something I&#x27;ve been grateful for.  It&#x27;s something I really enjoy. After using Williams soap for a decade, Van Der Hagen has been a highlight of my experience.  Astra blades have been another.  After changing to my last blade, I went to my local drug store and discovered that a package of 10 was over $5.00.  I bought one package and ordered the Astra 100 pack.  Shaving with one today was a great experience; smooth, close and nick free.  The blades are a great value and I&#x27;ll order again in 2014.</li>
    <li> They work very well, get a very close shave when used with a shaving oil.&lt;br /&gt;Barely every cut myself, it will tug hair if your shaving form is bad!&lt;br /&gt;Comparing to the &amp;#34;Super Stainless Straight Edge Barber Razor Blades&amp;#34;, these worked much better for me as my beard hair is extremely thick!!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much a cheaper Feather blade! :D&lt;br /&gt;Will probably order more in the future soon, these will last me about 1 year and 1/2 or more.</li>
    <li> my first time using a safty razor and I have no complaints. At this price I tend to change it ever other shave even though they could probably go longer.</li>
    <li> This is good product. I like it, but  If you compare to similar products (original&lt;br /&gt;Gillet ) the last one  is much better.</li>
    <li> Took me a while to get the technique down but now I am in love with double razors.  I tried a starter kit and found that these were my favorite razors.  I would advise any new saver to try some different brands before investing in 100 blades.  I am going to be trying the Feather brand next and will update this when I have some to compare with these Astras.  Overall though I fould that these provide a great high quality save for a wonderful price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Shark, Derby, Feather, and Astra blades in my time wet shaving over the past year and a few months. I found the Shark and Derby to be unpleasant when I shaved with them. The end result was not a very good shave either. Feathers were great, but a bit too sharp and intense. My beard has a crazy growth pattern with about 4 direction changes and a cowlick. I needed something sharp enough to handle multiple directions of hair growth at once, but not so sharp that I&#x27;d nick myself if I wasn&#x27;t super careful. Astras fit the bill better than any of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Parker shavette, so the 100 pack of double edge blades was actually 200 single edge blades in my eyes. At just under $10 for 200 shaves, I can use a new blade for every shave and not worry about it. Seriously, you can shave daily for over half (or a third, if you use a DE)of the year for under $10 and never use a blade twice. Couple that with the fact that these blades are great quality, and it&#x27;s a hard deal to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I recommend getting a small pack of 5 before going for the 100 pack, just in case these don&#x27;t work out for you (not all beards are the same - your mileage my vary!)But consider the value of these if you need something to tip you over the edge and buy these.</li>
    <li> Much better than any razor I had before. A revelation. I great value. I highly recommend. This will cost 8 cents a week. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Beautiful way to save money.. I&#x27;ve only had these blades and the blades that came with my Merkur razor. But these have been perfect so far. I&#x27;ve cut myself once in the six months I&#x27;ve been using them and it was minor enough that I nearly forgot about it. I change out the blade about every two weeks and that&#x27;s more to use them before they rust than because I need to. There are 100 blades here and the blades last long enough that you&#x27;ll die before you use them all if you changed them when needed. Can&#x27;t recommend them enough, especially to Mach 3 shavers that are thinking about getting a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a safety razor for a few years now. I used to use blades purchased from the local stores, most of which are just re-branded blades made by American Safety Razor. These Astra blades easily last at least as long and are significantly cheaper, probably in part because you&#x27;re buying in bulk. I like them. When I finally run out in a year or two I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> These blades are great. Went back to Double edge blade after 30 years being away.&lt;br /&gt;It have the best shave I have had in 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;I tried shark and did not really care for them.&lt;br /&gt;These are great. With shipping. I am paying about 15 cents per blade.&lt;br /&gt;I am in the habit of changing blades every week.&lt;br /&gt;I will not go back to the3&#x3D; blade razors ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5-17-2013&lt;br /&gt;I am still very pleased with the blades and still have over a year supply of blades&lt;br /&gt;left. I did learn to shave after I shower it just makes it easier to get a excellent shave.</li>
    <li> You will love me, and my father for what he taught me regarding double edged safety razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a GREAT SHAVE with a safety razor and NOT CUT YOURSELF.  You must put in TWO(2) razor blades inside of your razor.  This will give you double the strength so it won&#x27;t cut you.  If you only use one razor blade, its so thin, and it bends so easily, that it will cut you like a paper cut.  So thin, ZIP, you&#x27;re cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength of the two(2) blades will keep it strong and you can wiggle your razor blade up, down, left, right, fast, slow.  Its much easier than ANY disposable razor blade.  It even lasts longer than any disposable razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if this helps you...and you find it helpful that you end up using a razor blade and stay using razor blades and double edged razor blades.  Thank, Bing C. Dionida, me..LOL.  Really thank my father for sharing this with me SO LONG AGO.  I can&#x27;t believe NO ONE has pointed this out before.  Thank You, DAD Bing I. Dionida for sharing this secret.  Though he uses an electric shaver now...LOL.</li>
    <li> These blades are great quality and the price is cheap. I typically get 10 shaves per blade, which is more than I expected.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Excellent shave.</li>
    <li> The price was great, the service excellent . . . and the shave is smooth as silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about ten cents per blade for these Astras in my vintage DE razor, Gillette can take their Fusion Proglide and go jump in the lake!</li>
    <li> Great value on excellent DE blades. While not as sharp as Feather blades (which proved a little too sharp for me - lots of sensitivity after shaving), these Astra blades give me 5 shaves without the tenderness I experienced using Feather blades. And at less than a third of the price of Feathers, what&#x27;s not to like? Two years of blades (I shave every other day) for $10 is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> These are excellent DE blades that provide a comfortable, smooth shave for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using a DE razor for long.  I started with Feather blades, and I can get a week of daily shave from one blade.  I didn&#x27;t have any complaints about the Feather blades but when I saw the price for these Astra blades I decided I would give them a try. For my particular face, which loved the Feathers with nary a nick, the Astra blades were too rough.  They nicked me every time I used them.  I am lowering the frequency of shaves with the Astra to only twice per blade; they are now my weekend blade.&lt;br /&gt;So while these don&#x27;t work well for me I can firmly recommend that any new DE shave try a sample pack first because the variability of beards and blades.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my selection. Great price for the amount in the box, the blades themselves have a great edge and fit perfectly in my vintage Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> Blades are way to thin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;ve only gone through a single blade thus far. This leaves me with 99 more to go. At this rate, I will use ~26 blades in a year, since there is 52 weeks a year. Meaning, this particular pack might end up lasting me for more than 3 years. Yes, 3 years of use out of $10 worth of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem to hold up very well, and they obviously provide a very smooth, efficient glide. I was using another brand prior to Astra and it seems as tho these are slightly more sharp than the other brand. I actually had to slow down my shaving and be more careful, due to being so used to the other brand. Suffice to say, my first few Astra blade shaves left me with a few nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely rate these pretty highly, overall. It wasn&#x27;t the blade&#x27;s fault I got nicks, it was mine for going too fast. This is clearly a superior product and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> best blades out there. love em.</li>
    <li> it is very sharp and it goes smooth without pulling. I think its better than most of the brand that i tried before</li>
    <li> After trying 8 different brands of DE Razor Blades, Astra performed with flying colors.  Everyone&#x27;s face is different, so I certainly recommend you try a sampler pack, but Astra was for me the most comfortable.  After a decade of using various Gillette Mach-series multi-bladed razors, I wanted to improve my shaving experience.  After seeing some recommendations online, I elected to embrace the old-fashioned Double Edge Safety razor and wet shaving technique.  The blade that came with my Merkur was alright, but I wanted to see what else was available.  In the end, these Astra blades proved to provide the smoothest shave with no noticeable shaving bumps.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these blades. There I said it. Though, let me give you full context as it might help someone else who has similar issues to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these blades along with a Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor which had 4.6 stars; both here on Amazon. I tried the blade that came free with the Merkur first. It didn&#x27;t work well nor did these Astra blades come to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking I wasted my money trying to go down the Safety Razor route. I have a very rough beard (I shave everyday in the morning after I shower) so it wasn&#x27;t surprising I wasn&#x27;t able to use Safety Razors. I was, however, hoping to save some money by going this route over the Mach3. I also have an Phillips Norelco SensoTouch 3D electric razor which works okay if I use it everyday (anything past 2 days it won&#x27;t work) though, I still have to use my Mach3 afterwards to get a close, most of the day worth, clean shave. These blades (Astra) cut me in 4 or 5 spots almost every time I&#x27;ve tried using them. I thought it was because I needed more practice but, after a few days of getting cut, waiting till they healed and then getting cut again I decided this just wasn&#x27;t going to happen. The Mach3 has never cut me even once after years of using them. Cheap disposable plastic razors cut me too; just like these Astras did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I think it&#x27;s me in this case so, I feel slightly bad about giving these blades a poor rating but, I really don&#x27;t like them so, that is my personal honest review. I know it&#x27;s probably not fair under this context but, it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a fairly normal beard then I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be fine with these. If you don&#x27;t have issues with Safety Razors then you&#x27;ll probably be fine with these. If you can get a clean shave from an electric razor in the first try then I&#x27;m sure these will be fine for you. They definitely have allot of positive reviews. If, however, you&#x27;re more like me and are a bear of man when it comes to your beard and arethinking about switching to Safety Razors and these Astra blades than be prepared to have possible issues. I sure did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering trying some other blades and or upgrading my Merkur. If and when I do I will update this review. This should determine if a third type of blade is better and doesn&#x27;t cut me or if it&#x27;s the Safety Razor itself that was the issue etc.</li>
    <li> Double edge blades not available at retail stores any longer. These seem a little thinner than the last I purchased at drugstore but are satisfactory for the side burn trimming that they are used for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few but, these are my favorite.</li>
    <li> As good as any I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;d purchase again when the time comes.  Why did I waste money on double edge disposable razors?</li>
    <li> Excellent blades for the price I paid. These will last me a long time before I have to order again.</li>
    <li> Very sharp! I use this to shave and it gives me a smooth clean shave every single time! Does not rust like other blades.</li>
    <li> These Blades are Great!</li>
    <li> 100 blades for less than 11 dollar who&#x27;s going to grip blade work for about 15 shaves</li>
    <li> You usually get what you pay for.  You get more for your money with Astra&#x27;s.  They&#x27;re not my favorite blade (Feather), but they&#x27;re a close second and they&#x27;re one third the price of my beloved Feathers.</li>
    <li> Bought these blades for my husband as he has switched from &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; razors.  He says that they work great, last several days, and leave him with less razor burn.  Great purchase for extremely cheap.  We will definitely be buying them again once his current stash runs out...sometime next year!</li>
    <li> Overall very happy with the price and quality</li>
    <li> These blades are absolutely what my faces wants and needs. I use these between two different safety razors and get consistently close shaves without the nicks and hassle I seem to get from other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary, but I bought two different sample packs, trying a total of 20 different brands of blades and picked the Astra Superior Premium Platinum without question.</li>
    <li> best purchase i ever made.  100 blades will last a long time. at 8-10 shaver per blade.</li>
    <li> Bought them back in March 2014 and I still have about one half of the box to go ( Due to my employer I have to shave everyday I work). They fit my Merkur safety razor and give a close shave. If you pay attention to the blade you will notice it is numbered on each side (1 and 2 on one side/ 3 and 4 on the other). It seems to be sharper on the side numbered with 1 and 2 (it may differ for you, I have extremely thick beard) and I can shave up to four times with it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only brand I have tried so far and it works well for me. There could possibly be other brands that would be of better quality out there (and more expensive). This seems to work for me because I got tired of throwing my money away (usually 25 bucks monthly) on a disposable cartridge that would give me a low quality shave.</li>
    <li> Bought my first safety razor and it came with 2 feather blades.  After the first time and first stroke with a feather blade I didn&#x27;t think I had pressed hard enough because I didn&#x27;t feel any pulling or tugging and didn&#x27;t think it had done anything but it had done a fantastic very close smooth cut.  I used the feathers 5 times each (the product came with 2).  I read great reviews on the Astra Platinum and decided to go with them thinking there couldn&#x27;t be much difference between blade brands and the priced seemed good.  That assumption was a big mistake.  The two used feather blades I had tossed had been far sharper after 5 shaves than a brand new Astra while the Astra pulled and tugged noisily as if it was a very old used blade.  Not happy about it especially considering I got 100 of them.  A brand new Astra Platinum blade shave needs touch up after the shave (I shave in the shower and have average beard growth).</li>
    <li> I am averaging about two to three times more shaves per razor than from the disposable gillette junk i once used. I am Happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Great  close shave. I love these blades! I tried a sample pack, of 8 different blades, and loved these the best.</li>
    <li> Extremely economical and give a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product to people who prefer platinum blades over steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Cons</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for years.  They hold up well and I get many uses from one blade.  They do just what they need to do.</li>
    <li> Astras are a perfectly fine workhorse blade.  They offer a good product for the price, but I don&#x27;t like them quite as much as some of the pricier blades.</li>
    <li> For about a third the price of Feather blades (which are, admittedly, sharper), I find the Astra an excellent and affordable option.  I get 2 or 3 very good three-pass shaves per ten-cent blade.  When coupled with the Arko shave stick and good technique (rather than in a hurry), I get very little razor burn.  Follow with some Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm and you have a budget set up that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I just tried this blade for the first time today and so far I love it.  I&#x27;ve heard people say different people like different blades for their faces and I&#x27;m pretty sure this is mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel quite as sharp as the Feather Blade I was using before, but the Astra blade feels like it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much and got everything on the first pass.  So for me, these blades are great so far.</li>
    <li> I am big fan of buying in Bulk and this was outstanding of a find for me! Keep them in distribution.</li>
    <li> I have been using Astra Superior Platinum blades in my Edwin Jagger DE89L razor for over a year now.  This blade is a phenomenal balance between performance and price.  I recently purchased some Feathers at three times the cost of the Astra blades, and I think the Astra blades hold their level of &amp;#34;smoothness&amp;#34; longer than the Feather blade.  This blade is the tits.</li>
    <li> I got into wet shaving back in 2011 when my girlfriend got me a Parker SR-1 for my birthday (which I still use today), and I&#x27;ve subsequently tried all sorts of razor blades.  I started with Shark, and they were okay, but they didn&#x27;t provide the smoothest shave.  They were okay for a light shave, but close shaves with them were uncomfortable at best and agonizing at worst.  So I moved on and tried some others.  Tried Merkur, Derby, Shark Super Chrome, etc., etc. with less than stellar results.  I also tried Feather and liked the shave, but the expense sent me searching for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found my way to Astra Superior Premium Platinum.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much given the price, but they wound up being exactly what I had been searching for all along.  They give me an extremely smooth, close shave with little to no irritation.  I have a very coarse beard that grows very quickly, and these Astra blades make quick work of it.  As a plus, they are extremely affordable.  I greatly appreciate this, as I have to shave daily and I rarely get more than two shaves out of a single blade due to the coarseness of my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, these blades wound up being perfect for me.  They might not suit you, but I would highly recommend giving them a try.  They&#x27;re high quality, consistently sharp and very affordable.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> I am a new convert to DE shaving, and everyone kept telling me to get a sampler pack.  I guess I could have, but I am in academics and ultimately like homework, so I did my homework.  I purchased an Edwin Jagger DE 89 for my first DE razor and chose these Astra blades as its compliment.  I have a heavy thick beard and knew that I would need something on the sharper end of the spectrum, but not the Feather-level of sharp.  So, I chose these Astra blades and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I use TOBS Jermyn Street Sensitive Skin shaving cream, the Edwin Jagger, and these Astra blades, and have a great shave every time.  I have been getting about 4 shaves with these, but I have to say, I wait a good 3-4 days between shaves, so it&#x27;s pretty heavy by the time I shave.  Even with heavy growth and a thick beard, these, in conjunction with the Edwin Jagger have had no problem, and I continue to get the best shave of my life.  As a new convert to DE razors and real shaving cream, I have to say that if you&#x27;ve considered the switch, but are hesitant, do your homework, get good products, and you won&#x27;t be sorry, I&#x27;m not.</li>
    <li> Cuts cleanly with much less/almost no irritation to sensitive skin areas. Edge lasts many shaves. Great quantity price, shouldnt need new blades for years.</li>
    <li> I typically use a Merkur HD 34C loaded with Feather blades, or a Muhle R41, loaded with either Bic Chrome Platinum or these blades, Astra SP.  These are a really good blade for either the HD or the Muhle. Very consistent quality. They&#x27;re sharper than the Bics by just a bit, but are much more forgiving than the Feathers.  I get a good smooth shave out of them, super smooth in the R41, and no irritation.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, either.  These are permanent stock in my medicine chest.</li>
    <li> I was tired of buying razors over and over again at the store. Plus they are so hard to find at a retailer. This is a good deal for the price with out a doubt.</li>
    <li> After having used Derby blades for about 2 years, I decided to try another brand.  I based this purchase on customer reviews.  These blades seem sharper than the Derby&#x27;s (a very good blade) and give a smooth shave.  I am not a shaving fanatic and generally shave with olive oil or Stephan Stay Smooth Conditioning Shave Cream.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the blades. They are sharp and they last longer than the ones you get from the stores. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> great blades for the price, sharp and they do the job.</li>
    <li> Prefect type of razor for my face. I would recommend trying several types of razors before buying a large supply of them.</li>
    <li> Finishing up my last few blades. I ordered these about 1.5 years ago. I shave my neck area every other day, and usually my legs as well (cyclist). I&#x27;ve got pretty thick hair, too. I change out the blade every 2 shaves. With all that, $10 to last about 1.5 years? Not too shabby at all, I say.</li>
    <li> One of these will shave my scalp and face twice. Quite a deal for around 10 cents each. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found a perfect blade yet. Astra&#x27;s are my go to blade though, with near Feather acuity with twice their comfort. They&#x27;re much more forgiving than the Japanese blade.  Astra is the only blade I have gotten great shaves with in EJ, Merkur, Weishi, Weber, Standard,and Gillette TTO heads. I have not found another blade with that range.  Safe blade disposal, and some wax on the blades are a small price to pay for all that versatility.  I&#x27;m a fan of the Astra SS blue too, which are slightly sharper, and slightly less forgiving, but also serve well in all my razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find a better blade for you get it. Check Astra out before you decide.</li>
    <li> Good product, nice price!!!</li>
    <li> Great blade, my husband and son love them, buy them with the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor, together the combination is great!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Smooth&amp;#34; means less razor whipping, made for sliding and hooking.. Sharpness gives clear tactile feedback, and good for 4-5 shaves.</li>
    <li> I am new to wet-shaving with a DE razor. I have been using the Derby blades that came with my razor with no issues. I moved to these blades once the Derby blades were spent because of the affordability and good reviews. I had a terrible experience with these blades. They have given me the worst razor burn of my life. I did some research and found that there are two Astra Platinum blades being sold. The one&#x27;s everyone seems to love individually wrapped in Astra wax paper and then these in plain wax paper stated to of poor quality.    I found this info in the Youtube video in the link bellow. (I did not make the video and am not claiming that, I just came across it during research)    [...]</li>
    <li> Great razors!!!! In my opinion an aggressive Double Edge razor but for someone who is learning to use an old safety razor if they are careful they should be fine</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome for the quality and price.They are very sharp. I use them to edge my hair line.I think I look fabulous!</li>
    <li> I STILL HAVE SOME OF MY FEATHER BUT I DECIDED TO TRY THESE BEFORE I RAN OUT. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED AT WHAT A COMFORTABLE SHAVE IT GAVE ME. I ALWAYS GET A GOOD SHAVE AFTER A SHOWER BUT SOMETIMES SHAVE BEFORE BED. I USE NOXEMA AS A PRE-SHAVE AND JUST LEAVE IT ON AND THEN APPLY MY SHAVE SOAP ON TOP. WORKS VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> I am still relatively new to the DE shaving game.  These are only the second blades I have tried but I think I&#x27;m going to stick with them.  I previously used Derby blades before buying the Astra blades.  I liked the Derby blades but they seemed to dull quickly.  The Astra blades seem to stay sharper longer and they offer a much smoother shave for me.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what my son told me when he saw I was shaving with a vintage safety razor that I bought and restored.  Of course the challenge then became finding blades.  Don&#x27;t bother with Wal-Mart, etc....ain&#x27;t there or at least I couldn&#x27;t find them so I turned to Amazon.  I did my due diligence, read the reviews and the Astra blades seemed to consistently rate high with the old school guys.  At $10.95, I didn&#x27;t feel I was risking the nest egg to give them a try so I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go back through the learning curve of shaving to get the hang of the safety razor, mainly letting the weight of the head apply the pressure as opposed to shaving with a piece of plastic.  The shave these blades give is fantastic.  I have a medium to heavy beard and am getting 4 to 5 shaves per blade (your mileage may vary) so do the math, that&#x27;s at least a year of shaving for $10.95.  Besides the great shaves, what I like the best is shaving with an absolutely clean razor every time.  I never could get all the gunk from between the blades on the multi-blade razors.  I break down my Gillette and completely rinse the head and the blade and have a pristine razor for my next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are already rockin&#x27; it old school or want to start, I highly recommend the Astra blades.</li>
    <li> These are great blades and at a really great price.  I have a course beard and these cut through easily while less-sharp blades would catch, jump, and nick the skin as a result.  I am using these blades in the Edwin Jagger DE89lbl (which I also strongly recommend).&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving with double edge blades for a year or so now, having started by doing lots of research and tried a number of other blades.  These are my favorite.  I thought I&#x27;d like Feather blades best, due to their sharpness, but they are a little too sharp, nicking the skin unnecessarily and seemed to dull after just two shaves.  These Astra blades a pretty close to the Feathers in sharpness but I&#x27;m getting 5-7 good shaves from each blade (and could go longer but why bother at ten cents per blade.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried a variety of other blades, including Gillette Silver Blue and 7 O&#x27;clock blades (too dull), Wilkinson Sword (way too dull), Derby (not bad, but not as good as Astra), and Dorco (a very good blade, this or the Feather blades would be my 2nd favorite, but Astra blades are my favorites and I like this 100 blade pack.</li>
    <li> Great price for the razor&#x27;s that are harder to find at the local shops.</li>
    <li> These razors work for me. No razor rash and very smooth. I get 4 or 5 shaves from each blade. A great value.</li>
    <li> Nice blades! Great price too. Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t switch to shaving like this sooner.</li>
    <li> These blades are worth the purchase. Wont beat a feather blade but better then derby blade.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> These things will last me years. sharp blades as well!</li>
    <li> Solid and reliable, Simple and clean</li>
    <li> I not only use de razors to shave face but also my head and these razors felt like I was using a cheese grader.....uugh.  Nothing more menacing than using blades that are inherently dull.  To sum it up I didn&#x27;t like them at all because they required me to shave with multiple passes which still didn&#x27;t leave a smooth shave and really irratated my skin.  I use a merkur adjustable futur razor, vulfix pure badger brush with Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street shaving cream.  I also tried personna blades with a slightly better result.  The de razor which is working best for me so far is the merkur platinum de razors which require usually one pass and don&#x27;t irratate my face or head and last two shaves.</li>
    <li> The shave is just as good as a nice quality disposable razor, however, for sensitive skin I would go with the disposable razors.  This type of shaving leaves a slight burning sensation because the razor passes over the skin differently from the other disposable razors.  I tried these safety razors at the suggestion of my dermatologist, but I am going back to the disposables and no longer use these razors unless I run out of the other razors.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades for the money.</li>
    <li> I was initially put off by the immense inexpensiveness of these razor blades, but ordered them because $10 isn&#x27;t much to lose for 100 razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, the multi-language packaging was disconcerting, but I do believe they&#x27;re Russian made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of use, I&#x27;m thoroughly satisfied.  Previously, Wilkinson Sword had been my preferred brand (as they were the only brand Wal-Mart carried).  They&#x27;re not overly sharp, at least in a detrimental sense, and they&#x27;re very consistent.  Packaging is convenient, with 5 blades individually wrapped in wax paper in a small cardboard box - 20 of which fit into the box which can be used as a dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part, though, is that I have exactly zero (0) qualms with using a blade 2-3 times before disposing of it.  In the past, I&#x27;d stretch blades up to 10 uses.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ve used the blades about five times before replacing them.  They maintain a good edge, and I have very coarse, thick facial hair.  However, it&#x27;s still a small luxury to use them only when they&#x27;re ultimately sharp within the first 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will be my go-to blades from now on.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve tried these blades before and like them, this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen on them. They give a great shave.</li>
    <li> Love these astra blades.  Quick and clean shaves.  Durable and long lasting blades.  Very good value.</li>
    <li> These are very nice blades and I prefer them over the Sharks I started out with. Originally i bought a sample pack from Amazon that had several brands including these. They provide a very smooth shave. i have very sensitive skin, especially in the mustache area and these blades do not cause any razor burn or irritation. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> certainly the best I have found so far - They are particularly good at seperating the hair from my face.  Haven&#x27;t tried seperating hair from a different region yet, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll do just fine there as well.</li>
    <li> i like them -seller great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m able to get about 4 close shaves with these blades. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> For 100 blades they sure are sharp and well worth the value. I&#x27;ve tried some other blades here on amazon, and I think I&#x27;ve found the best ones for my face. I use a new blade each time I shave (I mean, they&#x27;re are 100 blades here, so I&#x27;m a little largess when it comes to my blades). They DO dull sort of quickly I notice, but I use one and I&#x27;m done, so it&#x27;s not a big deal to me.</li>
    <li> Been shaving with a DE for about a year. I have tried a multipack that included dozens of brands of blades. This brand was not one of them. I went ahead on a recommendation and bought these blades. I can say with 100% certainty of the more than 12 brands I tried these blades were the best of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far superior quality, exceptional shave. Not once in awhile, but every single time. Nick free, cut free. These blades are the best. If anyone says otherwise they have either a) a defective razor or b) they do not know how to properly shave. You will get about 4 shaves on a thick beard per blade.</li>
    <li> I used a 5 pack of the Astras that were in a blade sample. They are a very nice blade for me in my Edwin Jagger DE89/barley and they are equally so in my Gillette Slim adjustable and Gillette 40&#x27;s Super Speed. They are smooth and sharp at the same time and are a nice balance. They consistently give me a smooth shave without nicks, razor burn, irritation or ingrown hairs. There are sharper and there are more forgiving blades manufactured but the Astra SP is a great all around blade for me with the razors that I use and my beard and skin types. (YMMV).</li>
    <li> Shave with the old Soviet Navy! The ships I mean.  I figure that&#x27;s what these blades are made from. You might want to check these with a Geiger counter. Old Russian inferior steel, made cheap. I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t come with rust. Oh well. Use vodka for aftershave for a real feeling of the Mansk morning.</li>
    <li> I bought a double edge razor for a neighbor who doesn&#x27;t do computers. Obviously one needs the blades to be in the razor to get a shave. I&#x27;ve seen him a few times since he took possession, his face is not all cut to ribbons and he has not issued any threats to me so I&#x27;m thinking he is at least satisfied.</li>
    <li> Are these the bee&#x27;s knees?  Not quite, but dang do I love them.  I started DE shaving eight months ago and have only used two different brands of razor blades so far.  Right after I bought my razor, I purchased Feather blades based on the reviews that I read online.  I have to admit that I only nicked myself a few times until I finally got the hang of shaving.  Although those blades were good, I wanted to try another brand just to compare.  After looking online, I stumbled across this brand and I am very impressed with the quality and sharpness of these blades.  These blades last a few days longer than the previous ones did and get a smooth shave up until I dispose of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with the blades, and it is just a minor thing, is the disposal of them.  The Feather blades came in packs of five and the pack featured a built in slot to store used blades.  The Astra package does not feature such a thing.  I have no problem throwing away the blades individually, but it was a lot easier to store them in the package and then toss that when complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall all, this is an excellent product and I will continue to purchase these blades whenever I begin to run low on numbers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few razors that are a little sharper than this one, but for the price of a year&#x27;s worth of razors - you can&#x27;t beat this. In terms of sharpness, I would put these at a solid Above Average rating.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of blades these are by far biggest bang for the buck</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t glide as well as I was hoping, but they are sharp enough and hold an edge well enough. I could see this being perfect for a lot of people, but it seemed to drag more for me than the Wilkinson Sword, which i have been using more lately.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these blades. They&#x27;re sharp and smooth providing a very close yet comfortable shave. I easily get 3-4 shaves per blade, 300 perfect shaves for under $10, great buy.</li>
    <li> Convenient packaging, very sharp, very good quality.</li>
    <li> These are great blades.  They shave a little different than the feather blades i have also used, but I actually like these a bit better.  They don&#x27;s feel quite as dangerous, and still give an excellent and shave.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical.  I have been paying quite a bit more for razors.  After reading some reviews I decided I would give them a try.  I&#x27;m getting four or five shaves before they start to feel dull.</li>
    <li> Good quality razors, a lot shaper than the Sharks I used before. Be sure to wipe them dry between uses to avoid rust, usually get 3-4 uses per blade.</li>
    <li> These are cheap, decent blades, that are good for 2-3 shaves.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Keep them coming!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nice close shave!!&lt;br /&gt;I personally had little razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;Hope there made in America cause I plan on buying another three hundred</li>
    <li> These are the best blades for the money. Sharks and Gilletes were terrible on my face. Feathers were amazing but are expensive. These blades are just below the sharpness of feathers but much cheaper. At this price you can use a new blade everyday and have a very happy face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many DE razor blades and most have tore up my face but not these Astra SPs.They deliver a very smooth and comfortable shave.I bought a 100 pack of these and will not be going back to the expensive cartridges.</li>
    <li> Astra blades are in my opinion the best for the money. If these blades work on your face, you can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star because of the price per blade and smooth shave.  I have used Merkur, Derby, &amp; Wilkinson Sword razor blades so far.  Of course YMMV applies to razor blades but this specific Astra razor blade has become my number one blade, Derby comes in second.  Merkur and Wilkinson were a little rough for me.  My ritual includes using a pre-shave oil, either TOBS and GFT shaving creams to ensure a good lather, alum block, and AOS aftershave moisturizer.  I recommend this product. I  will be ordering another pack to stock up since I shave my head and face everyday (I change my blades every 2 days because I like the feeling of a new blade.  Maybe I will get the courage to use the feather blades that were included with one of my razors.</li>
    <li> Very sharp razors.  I bought this box of razors to use with my scimitar style shaving razor.  I have had them for a few months and I realized that this purchase will be good for about the next 5 or 10 years.</li>
    <li> The blades are just what my husband needed.  They give him the close shave that he hasn&#x27;t had in years and without skin irritation.</li>
    <li> First, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  $.09 per blade, and for me, with 2 shaves each blade, that is only 4.5 cents per shave for blades.  Feather is more than triple the price even when buying 100 blades. Second, these are very good blades, at least in my Merkur.  I have used these for some time, and ordered another box of 100 so I am set for awhile. Feathers may be sharper, but the Astra Plats are very sharp and 1/3 of the price.  I move rather quickly through a shave and with minimal nicks, so these are probably better for me than something like feather. I typically do 2 passes and am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned glue on the blades.  That seems to be wax for the wrapper instead. I can&#x27;t see how that would affect anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I use this with my beautiful Edwin Jagger De87 Ivory razor and an Ivory Vulfix brush.  It&#x27;s so smooth.  2 passes and I&#x27;m so smooth.  My soap is Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat soap (got it from westcoastshaving with the matching ivory glass jar). That soap is better than Proraso cream, Castle Forbes Lavender, Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado (I could keep going).  That soap is incredible and with these blades I get the best shave.</li>
    <li> After trying a few dozen brands of DE blades, these were the ones I settled on. They are sharp without being TOO sharp, and I get a very close smooth shave while only very rarely nicking myself.</li>
    <li> the shave i get from these blades is quite phenomenal!!!!  it does take a little extra time to shave but its well worth it!!!...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im not blowing smoke when i state that these blades help in my getting my BEST shaves EVER !!!</li>
    <li> When I started using a safety razor, I was spoiled with a trial pack of Feather blades. When I ran out of the Feather blades, I decided to try a few lower cost blades to see how they worked. I started with Derby Extras and they didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Then I saw these Astra blades &amp; the word &amp;#34;platinum&amp;#34; in the title convinced me to give them a try. At first, I was happy with them. Then I noticed that I was changing blades with every shave. If I skipped a day of shaving I was using 2 Astras to get a reasonable shave. I have very sensitive skin and shaving on a daily basis was too difficult on my skin to continue doing. I think these would work fine for the majority people out there, but if you have coarse facial hair and sensitive skin, these may not work well for you. I have come to the realization that Feather blades are the only ones that work for my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product for it&#x27;s price and performs as well as other razor blades I&#x27;ve tried, like Merkur and feathers.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a little over a month now.  I change the blade every 4-5 days and they seem to stay sharp.  A few people mentioned cuts because of blade sharpness, but I have not found it to be a problem.  Nice close shaves with limited irritation.  Great!</li>
    <li> I have tried Feather, Gillette Platinum, Shark, Derby, and Merkur razors, but it is these Astra SP&#x27;s that blow the competition out of the water. They are made by Gillette in Russia just like the Gillette Platinum blades, but these are affordable, sharp, and smooth. They work very well on my sensitive skin. I recommend these before any of the other blades that I have mentioned.</li>
    <li> These are high quality blades made by Gillette (P&amp;G) in their state-of-the-art factory in St. Petersburg, Russia. They are very consistent and produce a smooth shave. Well worth the price and a huge improvement over the other popular DE blade (Derby). Dump the expensive multi-blade cartridges and get a better shave for pennies per blade!</li>
    <li> 100 razors for a cheap price! better than purchasing a box of gilette blades lasting about a month or so</li>
    <li> Considering my local grocery store charges me $3 for 10, this is a good deal.  No issues with them yet, seem to be sharp and doing a great job.  Comes in smaller boxes of 5.  Being double wrapped (paper then a wax) is a bit of a pain.</li>
    <li> I recently made the switch to a safety razor (the Merkur classic safety razor) and picked up a box of these Astra blades after using the included Merkur blade. For me the Astra blades do a slightly better job than Merkur blade and for 9 cents a pop you can&#x27;t really go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave that the blade provided was clean and quick. It was plenty sharp and I didn&#x27;t have any nicks, cuts, or any razor burn from the blade at all. Overall the Astra blades provided a great, clean, and close shave. I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are other packages of 100 mixed brand blades out there for 2  - 3x the price where you can get a feel for and find the exact right blade for you face but I&#x27;m not that picky, so finding the cheapest option was high on my priority list. These were the cheapest blades I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that I&#x27;m never going back to disposable razors again and as long as the Astra blades remain cheap, I&#x27;m sticking with them.</li>
    <li> I tried out a sample pack of razors before going with these. They were one of my favorites of the sample pack, and the cheapest per dollar by far. I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now and have 0 complaints.</li>
    <li> I know everyone raves about feather razor blades. I will admit they are very sharp. I personally don&#x27;t like a blade as sharp as a feather because of using a more aggressive shaving razor. Astra&#x27;s have given me great smooth shaves and at around $9 per 100 pack they are hard to beat on the pricing. I recommend giving one of this packs a try. If for some reason you don&#x27;t like them, which is probably highly unlikely, you will only be out the price of a burger basket.</li>
    <li> If I want a very smooth shave from a new blade, Astra SP is the blade I load in my razor.  I only get about three good shaves before they start tugging a bit, but at less than 10 cents a blade, I can&#x27;t complain.  If you haven&#x27;t tried Astra&#x27;s, you should.</li>
    <li> Great quality, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I shave my head along with my face and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the variety packs and that means a lot of different blades. I settled on a few favorites and over time I&#x27;ve found that by far ASTRA gives me the closest shave and one of the most consistent blades I&#x27;ve found. Safety razors are highly personal, meaning we all have our preferences and there isn&#x27;t by any means a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Compared to  MERKUR - ASTRA is just a better value. Compared to FEATHER - ASTRA matches the sharpness but is more forgiving. Feather was so sharp that I&#x27;d more frequently than I&#x27;d like to admit cut myself. Compared to SHARK - ASTRA is way more consistent blade to blade. At this point there isn&#x27;t another blade for me, I&#x27;ll stick with ASTRA.</li>
    <li> TONS OF RAZOR BLADES.  Unbeatable for the price.  Razors come in packs of five, so this will last a while. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Again, like many have said, no one razor blade will work for everyone. It&#x27;s best to buy a sampler pack and base your decision off of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my Merkur 180 it came with Merkur blades. Those felt like shaving with a piece of broken glass so I purchased a sampler pack. Most of them gave the same experience except for 3 - the Astras, Derbys, and Feathers. The Derby blades were good but gave some razor burn, the Feathers were overkill, but the Astra blades were perfect and I kept going back to those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide that Astra blades are right for your face then you really can&#x27;t beat this combo - at 10 blades for $1 it&#x27;s a steal. They last about 3 or 4 shaves, so since I shave every other day this box should last me 2 years no problem.</li>
    <li> Will have to learn how to shave all over again with this blade and the open cradle safety razor I bought as well.  Been using those over prieced Fusion razors for years.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price.  A great mix when paired with the Micro Touch One Razor!  Shaving quality up, shaving cost way down!</li>
    <li> Great razors but seem to dull mid shave. I find that I get about two great shaves, one mediocre shave, and one half mediocre- half butcher job out of one razor. At least I&#x27;m getting two great shaves out of each blade, which is better than I can say for other brands of blades I have tried.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my dad who still uses the old fashioned razor.  They stopped making his regular blades and he asked me to research another brand for him.  He was pleasantly surprised to find this brand for cheaper than his old one and just as good.  It is a quality product.</li>
    <li> These Astra Premium Platinum DE blades have just the right sharpness. I know some brands out there are sharper but there not forgiving. Just a little extra pressure and nix. No so with these, just hold razor at the very end &amp; get a perfect shave. One blade will last me 5 or 6 shaves, buy them while on sale!</li>
    <li> I typically shave just once a week, so my whiskers are pretty long at that point.  Each blade gives me two quality shaves.  I found the blades to be sharp, yet forgiving.  In my opinion, the closest comparison is the Wilkinson Sword blades.  For the money (just over 10 dollars for 100 blades when I purchased them), they are a great buy and should provide almost four years of shaving.</li>
    <li> The package came earlier than expected, which is a big plus. I have just begun to use these blades after using an electric shaver for many years. I&#x27;ll need a bit more time to re-adjust; however, the shave was quite comfortable.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a double-edged razor shaver, these blades are all you need.  They&#x27;re cheap, sharp and keep an edge for good long time.</li>
    <li> This is the second box I have purchased for my son and he says they are great.  Price is very reasonable and the seller sent them very quickly.  When my son needs more, I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> Clean comfortable shave,no problems, they work fine on my face but everyone is different. So give them a try there well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I like these blades and they are very reasonably priced. This large supply will last for quite a while and I will reorder from same seller again when running low.</li>
    <li> Most of the blades work every well, sometimes others dont.  For the most part, would recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  My safety razor saves me money on shaving by simply buying these packages of razors.  Always sharp and clean, and when you think you need a new blade, its an easy replacement!</li>
    <li> This is a marked improvement over the double edge razors available at the local supermarket. I find them to be easy on my sensitive skin and give a month or so of shaves before needing to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Sharp, smooth, pennies per shave. That is the best way that I can summarize Astra Superior Platinum blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra SP work well for me in my Edwin Jagger DE89, Gillette NEW, Super Speed, and Adjustable. In other words, they work well in everything that I put them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a large number of different blades and some are sharper and many are duller than Astra. Gillette Silver Blue seems a touch sharper and is still smooth. Astra easily beats it in terms of value. I actually haven&#x27;t found any blades that beat Astra for sharpness and smoothness for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not the blade of choice for everyone. No double edge blade is. They seem to work well for most, with only a relatively small number of people disliking them as evidenced by the wet shaving forums.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades. I&#x27;m new to the whole safety blade trend. These blades work wonders for me.  The thing to remember with all safety blades is that they are meant to be changed regularly. They don&#x27;t last as long as other blades but I find that they provide a superior cut. Finding the right pressure for your skin is critical. I have very sensitive skin, so for me I need to change the blades after every 2 to 3 shaves.  It can take some practice but once you have it down, these blades are excellent.</li>
    <li> i have never been able to shave everyday of the week no matter what type of razor that was used. I have been wet shaving for the past year and came across these beauties and now my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Astra blades are the best ever bar none</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and the only blade I&#x27;ve used other than the Astra SP is the Merkur blade that came with my Merkur Long Handle razor.  I bought this pack of 100 before I found out about the sampler packs, and was worried I might have jumped the gun.  But, luckily, these blades have never given me any problems.  No irritation or shaving bumps, and my face is smooth as glass after a second, against-the-grain pass.  The only gripe I have, and the reason these blades get a 4/5, is because of the glue noted by other reviewers.  The third blade I used had glue all over the edge, and while it was pretty easily removed with hot tap water and a thick towel (BE CAREFUL!), it&#x27;s not something I want to do regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for 3 or 4 years now and moved from a cartridge razor to a safety razor almost 2 years ago. Astra Superior Platinum blades have become my normal daily shaver. I own a Merkur 38C (my travel razor), a 1951 Gillette Super Speed Black Tip (my daily driver) and a 1961 Gillette Slim Adjustable (when I want an extra close shave). I have sensitive skin and coarse facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most everyone else, I bought an initial sampler with 60 blades and tried several of them. Once I worked out my technique, I re-sampled to see which blades I actually liked. I won&#x27;t bother talking about the blades I just didn&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Derby Extra was the first blade I liked. But it was only good for a couple of shaves before it had to be tossed out.&lt;br /&gt;2. Then I discovered the Shark Super Chrome. It lasted longer and shaved pretty close. It was the first real winner.&lt;br /&gt;3. When I tried the Astra Superior Platinum, I felt like I&#x27;d mastered my shaving technique and was ready for a sharper blade. I get no irritation. This was the blade I ended up sticking with. My last pack of 30 lasted about 7 months (shaving, on average, somewhere between daily and every other day). I finally ran out and have just ordered another 100.&lt;br /&gt;4. Feathers. These Japanese blades are ridiculously sharp. They require a good feel for your razor and being comfortable with the contours of your face. They are not for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the Astras are legitimately not as sharp as Feathers, but they are consistently great blades. I haven&#x27;t run into any Quality Control issues with them. I get a super close shave with no irritation. And they stand up to multiple shaves.</li>
    <li> very good quality!&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and extremely sharp!&lt;br /&gt;recommended for people who using safety razor!&lt;br /&gt;its a great product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who says that these are fakes. They cut like normal astras, and I have done a side by side comparison with my nearly finished case of astras, and everything looks normal. Great deal, and great blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been enthusiastic to try wet shaving for a few years and recently made the plunge. I tried the one blade that came with my safety razor and it was, well, I was unimpressed. I thought maybe I just need to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then picked up a 5 pack of [[ASIN:B001NTFAG6 Wilkinson sword]]. They were OK, not great. About the same as a Gillette cartridge. I thought I sucked at shaving. I was hesitant to try these Astra&#x27;s because of some of the negative reviews like \\&quot;can only shave one cheek per blade\\&quot;. But I figured, what the heck, it&#x27;s only $10, I&#x27;ll spend more than that trying 20 different brands. And the sample packs are more expensive than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, look at those 5 star ratings, because they&#x27;re right! Shaving with this blade feels like I&#x27;m shaving with a baby&#x27;s butt, and afterward my face is as smooth as one! I&#x27;ve never had such a close shave.</li>
    <li> The platinum tipped Astra razors came new in the box. There are 20 smaller boxes containing 5 razors--each razor covered in protective paper. The \\&quot;glue\\&quot; that holds them in the paper is easily wiped off before you place it in the razor (those reports of it being hard to wipe off are totally unfounded in my opinion). In fact, the \\&quot;glue\\&quot; is more like a cream than glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors themselves are spectacular. I had been using my previous razor too long and was shocked at how easy a shave I could get with a new, good quality razor. One swipe left my face almost completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good price for very good razors.</li>
    <li> I used to use wilkinson before. These are much sharper. My favorite!</li>
    <li> These razor blades have been the best I have used so far, other I tried are shark, Gillette blue, feather and personna. The feather blades are by far the sharpest but if you are new to safety razor not recommended because easier to nic your face.</li>
    <li> These blades are the Russian version of the American Gillette. I have been buying them for my family in Cuba and they say they are the best double edge razor blades they have used in years. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Update********  The ones purchased here on Amazon are not quality Astra blades. Could be counterfeit. They are individually package in white paper. Real ones are packaged in Astra print paper. Quality of shave is also not the same. I bought some here on Amazon and another 100 blades from another supplier and found the paper discrepancy and the quality of shave is not there. All packaging was identical for the exception of the individually wrapped blades paper and most importantly blade quality is different. I&#x27;ll keep buying Astra blades but definitely not from here. Before you buy from anyone ask if it has the Astra print paper. If the answer is yes, then you have the real deal. Don&#x27;t throw away your money to save 1 or 2 dollars.   The below review is on authentic blades.     Best razor for my skin. Leaves me no razor burn and cuts through my facial hair like butter. I&#x27;ve tried others like feather, merkur, shark and derby and this one is the best for me. Barely any nicks and no burn for my skin type. I tried this brand on a sampler and by far the best from the sampler package.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll try to keep this simple and to the point. I&#x27;ve tried several DE razors and currently have settled on two choices: Astra and Feathers. Out of the two the Feathers are sharper and because of this perform better but are more expensive in comparison to Astras. I usually only buy Feathers when I can find great deals on them. Astras perform well and are inexpensive especially when buying the 100 count carton/pack. You could use these blades 1-2 times and still come out ahead in savings compared to the cartridge type loading razors out there. So in my view (in regards to performance and cost) the Astras are just right for my face and wallet.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Carefully wrapped for shipping.</li>
    <li> Worth getting a large carton, more bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few blades now and rate these as one of my top two blades.  The other I like is the Shark SS blades.  These glide easily over the face and leaves the skin feeling smooth. No burns, no irritation after using one blade for a total of 3 shaves.  And at this price you can&#x27;t beat the Astra.  Using one blade a week and this carton will last nearly 2 years!</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome. Plentiful. Cheap. Great shave with very few cuts. I have a beard so I am only shaving around the edges, but a face is a face right?</li>
    <li> These blades will last me 3 years with shaving my legs !</li>
    <li> New to the wet shaving game and was loving it up until I tried these astra blades. They just aren&#x27;t for me. I bought an Edwin Jagger DE89bl and have been using it for about three weeks with the included Derby blades. While using the derby blades I had been getting great shaves with none of the irritation I had experienced with my old mach 3 system. I purchased the Astra blades due to all the great reviews and of course the low cost. Once I ran out of the Derbys I put on an Astra and have had about 4 shaves with them. These blades are just not right for my skin. I&#x27;m 4 shaves in and the skin on my neck is itchy/irritated and I have had breakouts on my chin like I used to get with the mach 3 razors. These blades might work for some but they don&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m switching back to the Derby Extras.</li>
    <li> so much cheaper than blades for the mach 3 and a great close shave</li>
    <li> I went through a large multi-pack of various blade brands and models before settling on these. I really like the blades I get a great shave with them.</li>
    <li> Great shave for a great price</li>
    <li> My favorite DE blade out of the several I&#x27;ve tried, thus the order of 100. They run on the sharp end of the spectrum, without quite hitting the terrifying sharpness of Feather blades. Their edges are also relatively durable, typically lasting me 3 shaves. My face is pretty sensitive and I often have to throw out blades after 1 or 2 shaves, making the Astra SPs an exceptionally good value for me. As with all razor blades, your mileage may vary, but Astra SPs are definitely a blade that all new wet shavers should try out.</li>
    <li> Have gone through 2 blades so far and they&#x27;ve worked really well. These seem to get a nice close shave without irritating my skin. I was previously using the blades which came with my Parker 22R and those used to always nick and cut my skin on the first shave on a new blade. These Astra blades don&#x27;t pull at my skin at all. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for some safety razor blades.</li>
    <li> I liked these ok but I much prefer Feathers.</li>
    <li> Great blades, not the best but excellent for the price.</li>
    <li> Super duper sharp! It has taken a few chunks of my flesh out, probably user error.... I really like how they&#x27;re individually wrapped, to prevent me from cutting myself before I shave. And I like how the box turns into a little dispenser.</li>
    <li> Great shave, great price. More blades does not equal better shave.</li>
    <li> A really good blade, and a great value because of the amount of blades for the price !</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp, and clearly are well-made.  They work perfectly in my Merkeu 34c safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing the cost savings.  A package of 4 Fusion cartridges costs more than 100 Astra blades!  The Astra blades work better than the &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; multi-blade cartridges, and for a small fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100 of these blades will last me roughly two years.  They are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I use these blades in a comb that is designed to trim hair.  I find the blades to be adequate.  They seem to be a microscopic bit smaller than the American made blades, and thus their cutting ability is limited.</li>
    <li> They work well but for one reason or another I enjoy the Shark brand more. Actually ended up not using the full 100 and switching back to Shark.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and super sharp</li>
    <li> Way better than the Dorco&#x27;s I was using.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes these blades, especially now that he&#x27;s used to a sharp blade again.  He&#x27;s been keeping score - last shave was without a blood donation!  His shaves are much faster now, too!</li>
    <li> These are great--best for wet shaving unless you&#x27;ve got skin that doesn&#x27;t mind dry.  Nice to get so many for such a low price--the &#x27;modern&#x27; disposables are just plain too expensive for so few!  These come well packaged--one giant box package to hold the 100, with interior smaller &#x27;boxes&#x27; to divide them up.</li>
    <li> Does just what it says on the tin. Gives me a nice close shave, and despite my lack of skill I have yet to cut myself. Cheap, but sharp. Highly recomend</li>
    <li> Try different blades when you start wet shaving. These work well for many, and the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by the nation who invented the AK-47. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them!</li>
    <li> great blades, long lasting and very cheap. Ive saved so much money since i switched to using safety razors.</li>
    <li> These are the best value.</li>
    <li> Great double edge blades for use in an old fashioned razor. I have purchased a variety pack and decided on using Astra for my face shape and chemistry. They are not the sharpest blade you can buy, but they work better for me and hold up for 4 or 5 shaves.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the cost but dull after one use</li>
    <li> Great blades a heck of alot cheaper than the ones with the expensive throw aways</li>
    <li> I like it, though it&#x27;s true what some say, there are a few of them that are magnificently sharp, and then there are a small number that wont&#x27; last more that a few shaves.  All in all the quality for the price is wonderful.  I have yet to try others, but it&#x27;ll be some time before I run through these, and that&#x27;s a big plus!</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp and long lasting. My husband loves them. And at this price, you can change them frequently but they don&#x27;t dull that fast.</li>
    <li> wish these had a razor disposal box.</li>
    <li> These are decent blades for me.  I only shave 2-3 times a week so a box of 100 will last me quite a while.  The price was certainly attractive at less than $12.</li>
    <li> These things are CHEAP! ...and sharp!  Provides are very close shave.  I&#x27;ve found that I can comfortably get four shaves out of this (on the fifth shave, I started noticing a pull and I had to exchange it out for a new one).  My &amp;#34;four shaves&amp;#34; consists of three passes, 4 different times, once a week, which is quite amazing since there&#x27;s a good amount of hair on my face after one week and I pass 3 times and able to do this four times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve calculated that I could technically get away with using a new razor each week and spend about $11, every two years on these (since it comes with 100 razors).  ... or I could use a new razor twice a week and it would still last a year; pretty crazy if you think about it.  Overall, it depends on how sensitive your face is to a dulling razor.  My face is pretty sensitive, so I&#x27;m finding out that these little razors are very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Want to spend about 10 bucks a year to have a great shave every day? Then chip for a safety razor and get these blades. I&#x27;m getting at least 3 shaves out of a blade and I shave every day. I love these babies.</li>
    <li> Great blades and great cost to boot. I have a course beard and it works great. I&#x27;ve tried Derbys and merkurs. Overall the Astras are very much like derby. also both much better than merkurs.</li>
    <li> these razors are great for me. they get me a smooth shave in about 2 or 3 passes, and last for 2 shaves. well worth the money i spent on them.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp but that&#x27;s all they have going for them. With my skin type these give a close shave but not without all the nicks and cuts (I only use the weight of the razor as pressure). The packaging isn&#x27;t great either because each blade has this gunky residue on it from the individual wrapping. I would highly recommend spending the extra money for better quality blades. Ordering Shark Blades now which I&#x27;ve used before and they&#x27;re great. These blades were very disappointing for me but it may be different for you.</li>
    <li> Great blades, second to Feather, but preferred since they are far more forgiving and provide just as good of a shave.</li>
    <li> So here is the deal sharp razor blades, for a low price, you cannot beat this. Stop filling landfills with your mach razors garbage, buy these and save the earth.</li>
    <li> I used to be of the opinion that sharper was better.  I bought a 100 pack of Feathers and was quite happy until my face started to get irritated.  Could be bad technique but when I switched to the Astras, it went away.  Now I will say, these aren&#x27;t as sharp as some of the uber-sharp blades.  But what they give up in sharpness they gain in smoothness.  In the end, I get just as close a shave with these as I did with the Feathers but with much less irritation.  And the price!  They just can&#x27;t be beat at this price.</li>
    <li> These blades are great.  I get at least 8 shaves per blade and some up to 14 shave (two per blade - Not bad).  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This just happens to be the blade that best matches my face and handle combination. They may not be for you, but I like &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I have found these blades to be high quality, super sharp, and extremely inexpensive. Definitely one that I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> First off, I recommend you try several razors first. I have used probably 20 different types and this razor happened to work the best for my face. My friend uses entirely different razors and loves them. ( I tried them and didn&#x27;t like them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for these, I love these razors. They stay clean and sharp for a while. I have a fairly sensitive face but these don&#x27;t give me any issues. And HOLY COW what a deal! I basically have razors for the year for 10 bucks. That is a heck of a lot better than that disposable crap I used to blow my money on. Take the money you save and buy nice cream (not out of a can).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, word to the wise, dont get suckered into those trial packs. 90% of the razors you get in there are junk and then you are stuck with 18 razors you dont like. Just suck it up the first time and buy smaller packs of a few you are interested in then try them for a while. Try Astra, Feather, and Mekur. Those were the top 3 for me.</li>
    <li> These blades are super sharp and give a very comfortable and close shave. My only complaint is that the blade only lasts about 3 shaves (I don&#x27;t shave everyday so long stubble shave), but from my experience this is only about 1 less than normal. For the price, the blade&#x27;s quality can&#x27;t be beat!!</li>
    <li> Smooth and sharp blades,  good for at least four shaves with a light to medium beard growth.  Cheap as well.</li>
    <li> These are my new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; blades.  They&#x27;re simply awesome, and pair perfectly and enhance the performance of ALL of my safety razors.  I&#x27;ve been a big fan of personnas for their smooth shaves.  But over the past few weeks, i&#x27;ve been comparing the two, and I&#x27;d say these are slightly sharper than personnas, shave even more smoothly, and result in ZERO burn or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;The real TEST was installing and using them in my new Cadet open comb safety razor.  This razor is significantly more aggressive than my EJ, Merkur HD classic, and especially the 25c open comb, and the Vintage Gillette tech.  If you don&#x27;t pay close attention, this razor will bite, and burn the crap out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;the astra blades paired with the Cadet OC provided a bbs shave with zero irritation and zero weapers.  Plus, the sub 9 dollar US cost for 100 blades is a great value.  I easily get 3 shaves from each blade, and have even gotten 4 shaves.  That is approx 300 irritation free, bbs shaves for less than 9 dollars.  How much would 100 Sensor blades, or Hydro 5 blades cost?&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d recommend this blade to be the FIRST choice for anyone starting to wet shave.</li>
    <li> This box will last forever.  Excellent shave and highly economical buy.</li>
    <li> These are my go to blades after trying Feather, all the Gillette brands and many others.  It is smooth and sharp and not harshly sharp like Feathers and they are always inexpensive.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Astra if you use a double edge razor, vintage or modern.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using feathers for a while and I thought they were the best(they are super sharp). I ordered Astra not expecting much but first thing I noticed was at the end of the shave my face wasn&#x27;t irritated(think I have sensitive skin). Now these are still very sharp but not super sharp as the feathers, and maybe that was why my face was getting irritated. Still beats the hell out of all the store bought razors MACH, SHICK, BIC. People need to stop wasting they&#x27;re money on those and start using Double edge safety razors like our Grandpappys!</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price. I even like these better then the Feathers that everyone likes. These blades last much longer and are way cheaper.</li>
    <li> These have been working for me great so far.and I seem to shave regularly and have not noticed the blades becoming dull too quick...but after all I don&#x27;t have much facial hair. Good value and don&#x27;t seem insanely sharp, cuts smooth but you have to use a slow and good technique with angle to get a good shave with any razor on the market. I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality razor that does what it&#x27;s supposed to very well. I can&#x27;t stress enough prep, prep, prep your face well. If you want an outstanding paint job you prep well; hey man I thought we were taking about razors here- it&#x27;s the same principle, great prep, great finish. These razors are a fantastic buy, and I&#x27;m sure we can all find better things to do with our cash than spend it on costly razors. There are many razors on the market but I suggest you give these blades a try because they work. Shave with the grain, perpendicular or against it but never side to side unless you want to see red- literally. Use these razors and make your face a lip magnet. Now go shave with confidence.</li>
    <li> Great blade. Sharp. Lasts a good number of shaves. The pack of 100 will last me for years.</li>
    <li> Best razor blade I have ever used. Not a complaint from me. I think they are the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Good razors for the price.  I&#x27;ve only tried feathers and persona razors from the .99 cent stores in California.  A lot better than the persona razors.  Not as sharp as feathers but does a good job.  I use these in my plastic Japanese feather safety razor I purchased on Amazon as well.  I shave every other day and I change the blades once a week so a 5 pack can last a month.  the 100 blades that I got will last me quite a long time lol.</li>
    <li> I started my DE shaving experience with the blades that came with my starter kit, Derby blades. While they were alright, there is a noticeable difference between the blades and the Astra are way sharper. Highly recommended. Must buy.</li>
    <li> Great shave only 10 cents a blade. Great value great shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for several months now, and the quality of these blades is very consistant. They are very sharp, and such a great deal. I can&#x27;t really think about how much I have wasted in the last decade on disposable plastic razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each one of these blades last me about 3-4 shaves, depending on how long I go without shaving. I trpically shave every day, unless it is my weekend, or I am changing my facial hair style.&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with these blades and I am going to order enough to stockpile for a few years.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and long lasting,,,,im glad i ordered!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades and feel the Astra&#x27;s are the best overall blade for me.  I really liked the feather blades but they are maybe too sharp and much higher price point.  Other blades don&#x27;t seem as consistently good or as sharp as the Astra&#x27;s.  A really great product.</li>
    <li> used shark blades b4 and these work so much better and much more of an easy shave with these blades</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the learning curve with these.  The don&#x27;t appear to be be as sharp as I originally hoped.  I have to make several passes, but still better than diposable and extremely affordable.</li>
    <li> The Blades are perfect. Great price, great product. All my razors are rust free, individually wrapped in boxes of 5.</li>
    <li> I shave with these daily.</li>
    <li> Just ordered more.  Great bald at a great price.</li>
    <li> I recently joined the ranks of wet shaving and was looking for a quality blade to use.  I tried a couple of other brands that were more expensive and thought that they were ok.  Then when I ordered another DE razor, the seller threw in a few of the Astra SP blades.  They are much better than the others that I have used.  So I ordered up this package.  So far they have been one of the best purchases since starting on the Wet Shave Journey.</li>
    <li> Great price but not very sharp</li>
    <li> Gillette built a state of the art plant in St&lt;br /&gt;Petersburg, Russia, that consistently produces some of the world&#x27;s finest DE blades. All products from there are top quality, my favorites are Astra Superior Platinum, Gillette Silver Blue, and Polsilver Super Iridium. The price for a 100 blade sleeve Astras is a steal.  The Astra is very sharp but smooth, I get at least 7 baby butt smooth shaves per blade, and could very well get more. Razorwise, I alternate between a &#x27;56 Superspeed, and an Atlas R1, with the occasional fat handle Tech.  The Astra is definitely my go to blade.</li>
    <li> The Astra&#x27;s are one of my favorite blades.  They&#x27;re sharp without being too sharp and very smooth.  I do like a couple of other blades a little better, but the Astras are so much less expensive that I couldn&#x27;t pass them up.</li>
    <li> A great product for the $$$!  Yes, it&#x27;s cheap but worth the value.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, excellent product in both quantity and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is a slight sticky residue that is in each individually wrapped blade that seems odd. A good rinse is a good fix.</li>
    <li> These are excellent and well worth the price (less than a dime a blade).  If you are looking for bulk blades for your safety razor, I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> sweet price and great shave</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, felt the Derby did a more aggressive shave. However,  the Astra does have a smooth shave, but you will need to make multiple passes.</li>
    <li> I use a combination of these Astra SP blades along with Feather blades (from Japan) in my Merkur 38c double edged safety razor. The Feathers are just a tiny, tiny bit sharper in my opinion but the Astras last about four or five shaves compared to the three shaves I can get from a Feather. That said, I purchased 100 of these blades for less than $10. (100 Feathers in the USA is usually about $27 to $34 on Amazon) Cant beat the price. Currently, I use the Astras as my weekday blades and Feathers for special evening or weekend functions. 4.9 stars out of five.</li>
    <li> I switched over to a double edge safety razor 8 months ago from cartridge razors (mach 3s) and I couldn’t be happier. I read a whole lot about different types of blades and decided to try these out. I couldn’t be happier about the quality of shave, and ecstatic about the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before these, I have only used cartridge razors and disposables (mach 3, Bic, etc.) and compared to those the quality of shave I get from these blades is just excellent. I usually take 3 passes on my face, but don’t really need to. It’s perfectly smooth after two; the third is just for good measure. I use these to shave my face as well as my head, and they work fine for both. When I first started DE shaving I would shave every other day. At that rate each blade would last approx. 3 weeks. Lately, I’ve been shaving every two to three days, and each blade is lasting over a month. What I mean is that I would still get good shaves out of the blade for 3 weeks to a month, depending. The blades do get noticeably duller towards the 3 week mark and I am able to tell when it is time to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid around $10 for pack of 100 premium blades. When comparing that to what I used to pay for cartridge razors it doesn’t get any better. I have read reviews about better or sharper blades. I’m sure there are plenty out there, but these do a great job for an even better price.</li>
    <li> A great deal for the money. Smooth and consistent. There are better blades but this is one of the best values. Some people are put off with the small amount of wax used to hold the wrapping in place. Only a few drops that melt off under warm water but all the better to insure that you get a good blade when when the wrapper is removed.</li>
    <li> Great blades and great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this line of blades as part of a multi-pack this was one of just a few standout models. They aren&#x27;t as sharp or agressive as the Japanese Feathers, but they just glide effortlessly over the face so I get less irritation and never cut myself. That means I can shave more frequently if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can confirm the assertion in other reviews indicating that some glue residue is on every blade due to how they are packaged. It&#x27;s a little annoying to rub them each off but by no means a deal breaker. Untouched the glue probably does not interfere, but just for peace of mind I rub it off quickly. No problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a couple of years when I run out I&#x27;ll try another platinum blade. Until then though, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> 100 blades...wow! This will certainly last awhile.  Product came quickly and as described.  For the price its worth checking out!</li>
    <li> Great value for money. Also the blades are very good quality.</li>
    <li> I have trouble getting the hair above my lip to actually look clean shaven.  This gets the job done, for a dime a pop.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is an Extremely uncomfortable shave. He said these blades shave almost like an old dull blade would.</li>
    <li> DARN good blades for the price! I get 5-6 shaves per 14 cent blade and I have a rough beard. Cost me less than $1 per month in blades!</li>
    <li> Nothing really to write home about.  Opened one up and tried it.  Noticed they were not as sharp or thin as the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; blades.  I am ordering a new razor in the future.  If I get it and notice a difference I will update this review.</li>
    <li> After buying a sampler pack of blades, and slowly working my way through them the Astras remain my favorite blade. At this price these are pretty much $.10 a blade. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would burn their money on the extremely popular overpriced and often crappy cartridge razors. Maybe no one knows about the option?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to keep in mind is that it is very possible you could hate these. This is why blade sampler packs are crucial.</li>
    <li> Really sharp blades that are thin which allow for a great shave. In addition, they are cheap which means that you can use a new blade for each shave. Some blades have glue residue on them when opened, but that doesn&#x27;t effect the shave at all. I would definitely recommend this blades to anybody that wants a great shave for not alot of money.</li>
    <li> I like the razors-especially the number of razors you get for the money. I&#x27;ve only had one of these razors knick my face-don&#x27;t know if it was me or the razor. But, I changed the blade and have had no more issues...remember to change the blade once a week. I have a medium beard thickness, so those of you with heavier beards may need to change yours out more often. The initial cost of getting into wet shaving can be expensive, but in the long run it costs less than shaving with the cheap throw away razors. I will purchase these razors again!</li>
    <li> These blades are incredible.  They offer the smoothest most comfortable shave ever.  They do have to be in the correct razor though in order for them to work properly.  For me, they work best in a Merkur Slant-bar razor.  Really fantastic shave all around!  This is my go-to blade.</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t shave to close I have to keep going over the same place a couple of times.  Then it cuts me.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and price. Use a safety razor and save mucho dinero compared to the &amp;#34;Mach 3&#x27;s&amp;#34; and such. I calculated my average cost per each shave (I change the safety razor blade every time I shave) to be about .20. Not bad!</li>
    <li> Great razors for the $$. I&#x27;ve been using them since the beginning of the year and they work great.</li>
    <li> Not as good as murkur blades. Great price, but sometimes you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I give these a 5 because they are easily the closest shave I have ever had. My face was perfectly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will tell you, they cut me. My skin just cant handle these things. I need something less harsh. I wont be getting more of these. But everyone is different. These will work great for someone else and those blades they dont like will work great for me. Its not just a matter of being sharp.</li>
    <li> Best blade!  Great smoothness and sharpness.  Simultaneously forgiving and efficient.</li>
    <li> Find these to be prone to rusting moreso than Merkur or Feather.</li>
    <li> Upon getting a safety razor, I&#x27;d thought I wanted to try many different blades in order to see what offered the best shave. Since then, I&#x27;ve gone through a whole box of these, and have never really wanted anything else. They are an excellent value and offer a great shave compared to the Merker blades that I started out with..</li>
    <li> Appears to be lacking in QC.  Some of the blades are excellent.  Others leave me feeling like I just shaved with broken glass.  Finally just decided to toss the rest, and spend an extra $10 for some German steel.  Much happier with the new blades</li>
    <li> A great blade , it is smooth, forgiving and it gives a great shave. I  think that the only other blade that comes close to the ASTRA SP is the Blue Bird, which is sharper, but sharpness does not make a blade better. SEE FEATHERS.</li>
    <li> Man, I am here to tell you, yes you MEN. Get rid of that 7 bladed overpriced piece of junk in your bathroom &amp;#34;called&amp;#34; a razor and get back to what Grandpa was using. A GOOD single edge razor, shaving cream that comes in a bowl or tube and a good silver badger brush and lotsa hot water. You will not believe how smooth a shave you will receive. (Remember the SNL skit back in the 70&#x27;s that lampooned multi blade razors that ended with &amp;#34;Because you&#x27;d believe anything?) Well, stop believeing &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34; and go back to the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went backwards in shaving history and found that the overpriced piece of junk I had been using was just that. I was being robbed buying 3 and 4 blade razor blades that cost 10 cents to make and were emptying my bank account.&lt;br /&gt;I have a beard that is like copper wire. I have shaved it for years using a multi blade and thought I was getting a close shave....wrong.&lt;br /&gt;These ASTRA Blades are wonderful. I get the best and closest shave I have ever had with these and do the math. You will save MONEY galore using them. My wife loves the smoothness and so do I! Do it, buy ASTRA, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Super mega-awesome cheap blades that are very sharp and won&#x27;t break the bank. Stop deliberating and BUY BUY BUY!!! :)</li>
    <li> Great blades - higher quality than cartridge razors. When I bought these, they were about $10. $10 worth of these blades goes a lot further than $10 worth of cartridge razors without a doubt.</li>
    <li> These are my go-to blades purchased when I first bought my DE razor (EJ D89) last year. I&#x27;ve tried many different (and more expensive) blades since then and I find the Astras to be the most comfortable and least likely to give me razor burn. No, they&#x27;re not as sharp as Feather but I get a much better shave overall, probably because I have sensitive skin. Plus, you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful price for a great blade!!  I have sensitive skin and these blades are perfect for me!!</li>
    <li> These blades do the job just right. You can get about 3-4 good shaves out of them before they start to get dull and tug on your whiskers. 5-7 shaves if you don&#x27;t mind the tugging every so often.</li>
    <li> 12/2016 UPDATE: Still using these as my primary blade. After a couple of 100 blade boxes every blade is consistently good and the same. Sharp yet forgiving and smooth/no irritation!&lt;br /&gt; These are made by Gillette in their St. Petersburg factory on original Gillette equipment. If you love the old Spoiler Gillette blades or the current Merkur Platinum blades you&#x27;ll love these; like the same thing!  Smooth, no drag or pull. As long as I don&#x27;t push or rush no razor burn. Been using these blades for five years now and love them!  Give them a try!</li>
    <li> These Astra blades are razor-sharp and affordable. I love a close shave at rock bottom prices, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Perfect for fast growing medium beard. Keeps an edge for about a week before needing replacement. Gives a 24 hour shave.</li>
    <li> Good  blades nice price sharp good value  for the price</li>
    <li> I do not have much experience with other blades but these are amazingly cheap and work on my thick facial hair just fine. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good first blade.</li>
    <li> Nice razors. Cheap as all get out too! I went from $20 for 4 cartridges on the Gilette Fusion to $10 for 100 of these bad boys for my safety razor. Make the change, shave like a man, shine in the adoration of women.</li>
    <li> One sharp piece of steel is very much like another.  These are certainly sharp, and a great value - the price is so low that I could use a new blade with each shave if I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are packaged in ten small boxes of ten blades each.  This is useful for discarding used blades.</li>
    <li> Moved from Merkur to Astra, I had heard the blade was a bit harder to use but might handle my beard a bit better for everyday shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the move to safety razors about year ago (May 2012) due to problems with ingrown hairs (and to a lesser extent, the increasing cost of disposable razors.)  I had been pleased with the Merkur blades, but found when I had to shave multiple days in a row it did not do as good a job (although massively better than and multi-blade disposable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was referred to Astra by a friend and wow... I am loving the blade.</li>
    <li> I love these blades!  When I started using a safety razor a few years ago I bought a sample pack of razors and these are by far my favorite of the bunch.  and 100 razors are enough to last me about 2 years!  That is some significant savings when compared to a modern multi-blade one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s face is different so I would suggest getting a sample pack to see what works best for you.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. Can&#x27;t beat it. Especially when local stores mark the price up by 200%.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades to use.  I have sensitive skin and Astra blades do not cause irritation.</li>
    <li> These are very good for the price but I prefer the*stainless they are smoother and less irritation.. Try the stainless</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried feather&#x27;s and the Isreali Personas. Definately like these the best and for the price, they just can&#x27;t be beat. In all my extensive research on DE blades, these seem to be amongst the top 3, if not the most popular.</li>
    <li> I used multiple different blades when I started using a Safety Razor, I was recommended to try these in a sampler pack I said forget that Ill risk it I ordered 100 and havent looked back ... Heres to not giving Gillette $25.00 a month Yipee</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with these blades, made in Russia.  They are very comfortable and last longer than normal blades.  A great match with the Merkur Razor.</li>
    <li> Super happy with this purchase. I think blades vary from user to user, but I love these. Switched from my Shark blades over to the Astra. What a world of difference in my shaving routine.</li>
    <li> After trying many blades, I was torn between these and the shark blades. But after using these blades for a few shaves it is clear this is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, DE blades are different for everyone, but these are quality.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: big gobs of glue on each razor blade from the packaging. Doesn&#x27;t really bother me though.</li>
    <li> Fine razors. I have tried various but these seem to work best for me. I have a medium course beard and this razor cuts fine with no burns.&lt;br /&gt;I usually push 3 shaves out of one razor which is actually stretching it a bit.However at this price you can afford to swap them out more often.&lt;br /&gt;I rate these my favorites, followed by Sharks, then Feathers. Dorcos are last because they just dont seem as sharp for my type of beard.&lt;br /&gt;will definitely stick to these.</li>
    <li> I have to replace after every 2 shaves, so not as durable as hoped.  Will likely go with Feather blades next time.</li>
    <li> If you like an evening shadow this product is for you.  The blade is well dull with two shaves. Manufactured in Russia.</li>
    <li> For the price you can do two fresh shaves and not feel guilty with putting on a fresh blade.  After trying a sample pack, these worked best, closely followed by Wilkinson Sword and Bic.  I have light sensative skin and a thick Mediterranean beard.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades for the money</li>
    <li> I used astra in another variety pack. Those blades seemed sharper than the maga pack I bought. Maybe my face just adjusted to the new razors</li>
    <li> What can I really say about a razor? Every individuals skin is different, so you need to find the right razor for you. The Astra SP works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> The best blades I have found for the price. I used to use Derby but had a few too many bad blades. At their even cheaper price Derbys can be thrown away but it is the frustration of having a bad shave that is the real cost. In my experience Astras offer the best combination of price and quality. These are very sharp blades, even and very consistent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside is they are in cardboard sleeves meaning no plastic container with storage for used blades, which is very useful for travel. I use a small sharps container at home to store used blades, and I find myself bringing a pack of Derby&#x27;s as backup and for use of the used blade storage on their package when on the road. These are great blades, well priced. One of these packages is almost sufficient for a year using two blades a week, an incredible value when you think about it. You can pretty much eliminate the cost of razors by using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used DE razors for 4-5 years now and have no regrets. Every time I see the incredibly expensive packs of cartridges for the latest Gillette razors at Costco I am amazed that so many people pay so much for a product that does not work as well as the 1904 technology in an original double edge safety razor. Modern marketing is powerful stuff. But Amazon makes quality shaving products freely available. With Astra blades and my Merkur long handled razor I am ready to greet each day. These blades are excellent quality and an excellent value, I see no reason to use anything else.</li>
    <li> Great price for 100 blades. Quality is average. 3 shave max/blade. Not especially sharp.</li>
    <li> These are really good quality blades for an amazing price. I have sensitive skin so I am weary about the blades I buy. However, these blades glide smoothly across my face, give me a close shave, and don&#x27;t cause any irritation or razor burn. A definite must buy for anyone who&#x27;s being using a safety razor for awhile or is even just starting out.</li>
    <li> Blades are great, service was wonderful!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Cheap blades, pull hair</li>
    <li> Absolutely Fabulous!  Won&#x27;t buy any other blades. No razor burn.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades, enough said.</li>
    <li> Holy crap I am so glad I got a safety razor, these blades are high quality and durable, I use them for about 2 weeks worth of shaving at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saved so much money over the now standard razors and their &amp;#34;cartridges&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave like a man and be frugal at the same time.</li>
    <li> These work great for me. I purchased some other blades that got good reviews and they didn&#x27;t cut well for me. I guess mens beard thickness would play a big part in that. I like these much better.</li>
    <li> Work great, last two weeks</li>
    <li> I looked at multiple brands when making this decision and for the quality and the price these can&#x27;t be beat.  I tried the Feather&#x27;s and Derby&#x27;s along side with these but I prefer the Astra over any of them.</li>
    <li> I am still a newb when it comes to wet shaving.  I am only a year into it but I know w good shave when I feel it.&lt;br /&gt;I thought feathers were the sharpest out there but these Astras are killing it.  There are a steal at 10 cents a piece.&lt;br /&gt;With a wtg pass it was pretty much the same results from a wtg and a atg pass with the feathers.  The feathers&lt;br /&gt;only last me two shaves and they are finished and that second shave isn&#x27;t the greatest.  I&#x27;m only two shaves into&lt;br /&gt;my first Astra blade but the second shave out of it tonight is still better than any other blade I&#x27;ve used even on&lt;br /&gt;the first shave out of it.  I purchased a whole pile(100) of Feathers and a couple boxes of other random blades in a sampler.&lt;br /&gt;I figured the Feathers were always bragged about, so I would just get a bunch of them.  These Astras just made me waste&lt;br /&gt;my money on the many Feathers I had bought as I have no use for the Feathers any more. It&#x27;s still early to judge the longevity out of these&lt;br /&gt;as I am only on the first blade but judging by that second shave tonight, I think these are my blade for life.</li>
    <li> These were my first DE razor blades and I love them. Much better than cartridge razors. They cut smoothly over the skin and do not irritate it. I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Perfect. No better deal</li>
    <li> Dam these things are still lasting me. They&#x27;re nice and sharp, and they get the job done. Give &#x27;em a shot.</li>
    <li> Fast service very good product.  Also a very good value for the amount of money.</li>
    <li> Good for my face. If you have a safety razor that works. These blades will do the job.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and for me last a long time.  It will take years to go through this box</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price. I suspect that this will keep me going for well over a year. Not bad for eleven bucks.</li>
    <li> Great Shave, Great Price</li>
    <li> seem to do a fine job</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Decent product.  This box will last me a few years</li>
    <li> Awesome price and very sharp blades</li>
    <li> Over six months later and I&#x27;m still on the same box, these blades are great.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I&#x27;ll buy this again!</li>
    <li> While I personally put more value in the quality of the shaving cream/soap being used, the blade itself is responsible for cutting the hair (and other things if not careful).  There are a myriad of razor blade options available, but I wanted affordable quality and was fortunate enough to try ASTRA DOUBLE EDGE RAZOR BLADES from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these blades over 5 months and I have NEVER experienced shaves as close as I’ve been getting in those 5 months.  Remarkably thin, yet durable, I can squeeze a week of daily shaves (moderate-to-heavy facial hair growth) from each blade before needing to replace it.  The math definitely works in my favor as I can get almost an entire year of great, super close shaves from a single box of blades that costs less than one refill pack of the “high-end” disposable 5-blade garbage being peddled to the masses (they’re only good for a handful of shaves before needing to be replaced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the ASTRA DOUBLE EDGE RAZOR BLADES providing the quality I’m looking for at a price that can’t be beat.</li>
    <li> My hubby&#x27;s only complaint would be the wrapper on the blade is somewhat difficult to remove, but the price more than makes up for this.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades, great deal. I have very thick stubborn facial hair and burn through blades very quickly... of all types of razors I have used an old fashioned safety razor has been by far the best, least irritating, and cheapest. These blades have been the best safety blades I have used. I have since switched to a beard and am not currently using them anymore, but highly recommend for anyone who needs to shave!</li>
    <li> These blades offer a really smooth shave and I do not cut my face nearly as much with these ones compared to other razor blades!</li>
    <li> My husband wanted to go back to using his double edge razor since the price of razors has gotten so expensive. This will keep him in blades for a while without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I started my wet-shaving experience with a 10-pack of Feathers.  Sharper is better, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really.  I thought all the cuts and burning were simply de rigeur for wet shaving.  In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that I often experienced nicks around the corners of my mouth and around my throat using disposable razors like the Mach 3.  So I&#x27;m probably at least partly at fault in terms of technique.  However, that same technique resulted in zero cuts my very first time using one of my Astra blades.  Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But clearly there must have been a trade-off in terms of closeness of shave, right?  NO!  If anything, the quality of shave was even better with the Astra!  I think that because the blade is less aggressive, I must have been able to give a little more attention to my problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not to say that the Astras are unequivocally the best choice for everyone.  I don&#x27;t have particularly dense or coarse facial hair, and I image that a sharper blade like the Feather is extremely helpful for those who do in mowing down their facial forrest.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, like this better than the off brand ones that came with my razor.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find a blade I like better than Feathers. These are much smoother with less &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; while still giving a very close shave. They&#x27;re also less expensive which is an added bonus. Longevity is on par with the Feathers I&#x27;ve used, about four great shaves and one decent shave afterward. I will definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only use a couple blades so far and I can only compare with my old derby blades (horrible), but so far, these are great.  I use these with Cremo Shave Cream, makes shaving a little less of a chore now.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> These are the first double edge razors I&#x27;ve used but they are nice and sharp, they provide a close shave without the orientation or burn. I&#x27;m glad I chose these to be my first double razors to try.</li>
    <li> I started out with a sampler pack that had some of these in it and these were hands down the best of the ones I tried for my face.  The biggest issue with these is they are not consistent.  I will either have the best shave of my life or a very sub-par shave depending on the blade that I put in.  I was hoping that it was just the way that I put the blade in my Merkur but I&#x27;ve had plenty of tries to test that theory and it doesn&#x27;t look promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy them again?.... I think I&#x27;ll try Feather next time.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and dependable blade. Works great in my safety razor.</li>
    <li> The blade are not nearly as good as other blades I have used in the past. I don&#x27;t have a thick beard at all and these blades loose their edge after two shaves...I would try some other brand</li>
    <li> Great blades for the money!! You really can&#x27;t beat them for the money</li>
    <li> These were my first Astras, and now I use nothing else - great quality product!</li>
    <li> I really like these.  The only other blade that is comparable for me is Merkur (I use a Merkur razor), and those cost more than 5 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble describing why they&#x27;re better.  I couldn&#x27;t really say if my shave is smooth, soft, sharp, aggressive, tugging, gentle, or whatever other people say in reviews.  All I know is I get a close shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> These Astras are good razors for a good price. Feathers give me a nicer shave, but they&#x27;re not worth paying triple the price for the same number of razors. Astras easily come in second place, giving me a smooth, nick-free shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derby dbl edge blades for the past couple of years.  While I&#x27;m please w/ their packaging of the set and individual blades, I found them to not provide me w/ a truly close shave and left me prone to ingrown hairs.  Why?  Because I recently switched to using Astra blades.  While I don&#x27;t care for their packaging, they make up in providing the closest shave I&#x27;ve had outside of a barber.  It glides so smoothly over my face and neck that I can complete my shaving in less time and not worry about nicks and cuts, particularly below my nose and chin areas.  More importantly, I&#x27;ve witnessed less ingrown hairs...  Hence, I&#x27;m completely sold on Astra blades!</li>
    <li> Quality blades. Each blade lasts for a week or more.</li>
    <li> Really how can you beat this?  100 blades for this price?  That&#x27;s like $.10/each.  They&#x27;re not Feather sharp, but they&#x27;re WAY better than any cartridge razor blade.  I get 3 shaves each and at this price I can replace sooner if need be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two blades so far. They do not seem to be as sharp as feather. 10 feather blades are worth more than 100 of these astro blades. The astro blades cut like dulled feathers (feather that have been used 3+ times). I am very disappointed with these astro blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus side, is they can cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/26/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them for over 4 months. I used a new blade for every shave. Sometimes one edge is sharp, providing a smooth shave. Sometimes both sides aren&#x27;t quite sharp. Today I got a bad nick, going with the grain, first pass. The worst nick I&#x27;ve ever had shaving. Terrible blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s not the safety razor. I&#x27;ve use the same Safety Razor with Feather blades and have never had bad experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shaver, from a $3 pack of disposables, does a better job of providing a close, smooth, consistent shaving experience, than these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bunch more left, but I&#x27;m done with these blades, they are awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a company to sell such a low quality product disgust me.</li>
    <li> These are the lightest touch of a blade that has touched my face in 35 years. I never left DE blades. Shaved a couple of times with bic and other disposable multi-blade crud over the years, usually while away in the Military because at times we couldn&#x27;t have DE type razors (like Basic, AIT, SERE school and a few other bizarre training cycles) always went back to my original Gillette butterfly (don&#x27;t ask a model number cause they don&#x27;t make them nor do I care to find what the model was since they haven&#x27;t been made since before I was born - mine being 2 brand new hand-me down from a Grandfather who hoarded a few before they went off the market). Anyway, to get back on topic, I have used these in my Gilette, my Edwin Jagger De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated, and some cheap Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle (that I travel with and it cost a WHOLE $3). These blades are PHENOMENAL. They cost a penny plus some 100ths of a cent each shave- seriously each blade is less than 10 cents. I get 7-10 shaves from a blade (PS the Military made me shave 2x a day, just about every day since my beard is so noticeable - not quite like Former Pres Nixon but darn close). I am afraid to order more cause like my Grandpappy, I don&#x27;t need to have shaving supplies laying around after I am gone, but I am tempter to stock up so they don&#x27;t end up off the market before I need more.</li>
    <li> These are my go to blades since I switched over from the expensive ProGlide blades. I tried several types from a sampler pack I bought and ended up with these and Feather blades. I should have made the jump sooner. I get two good shaves from each blade. I may be able to get more but at the price they are I just toss them out. At 100 for under $10 bucks shipped I stocked up for a years to come.</li>
    <li> I have been DE shaving now for a few months.  I have tried Feather, Shark, Derby, Gillette, and Astra blades.  Feather are too sharp, it seems hard to not nick yourself.  Shark, Derby, and gilette blades seem to be dull and pull.  Astra blades are perfect.  I get a great shave without nicks.  I get 4 shaves out of an Astra blade, so  at 10 cents a blade ... 2.5 cents a shave ... great.</li>
    <li> These blades are amazing. Review over.&lt;br /&gt;Alright, longer version: I got a 52&#x27; Gillette Super Speed a few days ago, these fit perfectly. They are incredibly sharp, but have a small enough cutting surface so they are easy to hold without slicing yourself. Their packaging is very good, 20 boxes of 5 individually packaged blades. Each blade is in a bit of wax paper, in a paper envelope, then 5 envelopes in a small cardboard box, 20 small cardboard boxes in the full set.&lt;br /&gt;There is one part that threw me a bit. The cut is incredibly smooth, and quiet (If you&#x27;ve used a straight edge razor, you&#x27;ll know what I mean on the later) to the point of having a hard time telling if the blade is cutting, or just brushing hair, believe me: it is cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that Feather blades are sharper, to the point of cutting flesh very easily. They are also far more expensive. Ie. 100 Feather blades are around $25, so roughly twice times as expensive as 100 Astras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I accidentally mistrusted the price on Feather razor blades as 37/100, when on taking another look it is only around 25/100</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades.  At this price, and quantity, you could use a couple a week and still go an entire year before you had to buy more... this is fantastic!  They are very sharp!</li>
    <li> They are ok, they dull faster in my opinion. I prefer derbys or personnas</li>
    <li> These blades are ok.  I get a reasonable shave with these but I think the derby blades are better &amp; cost less.  Blades of course depend upon you skin, beard, razor, shaving cream &amp; other factors so you might like these more than I. I don&#x27;t care for the drops of wax they put on the blades to attach the paper that they are wrapped in but it does not affect the shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these blades are getting such rave reviews.  I found that the ones I got do the job, but just barely.  I based my purchase on the majority of good reviews here, and now I have a bunch of blades that I&#x27;m not too thrilled with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, be advised that if you&#x27;re considering buying these blades, in my experience they&#x27;re not as good as the other reviews would lead you to believe.</li>
    <li> You can not beat the price of this product. 100 razors for 10 bucks will keep you going for a long time to come. That being said, the sharpness of these leaves something to be desired. I have nicked myself a very few times after using them for over a year. It often takes multiple goings-overs to get a completely clean shave. Other commenter have mentioned the glue that sticks to each blade. This is by far the biggest downside to the product. The glue, if not properly removed (which is a pain) will accumulate hair just underneath the razor itself. I am able to use about 1 razor a week, which is just fine. A great deal, but with the sacrifice of cost comes a sacrifice of quality in this case.</li>
    <li> I bought these since they were only $10. Lets just say I&#x27;m trying find ways to get rid of them. They are usually good for about 1-2 shaves before the blades go dull. Even brand new, they aren&#x27;t as sharp as the Derby or Feather razors. After using this product I realized how great Feather blades were. If I have light stubble, this blade will do the work. If I want to have the best shave, Feather wins hands down.</li>
    <li> They are very sharp.  I use them 3-4 times before tossing them</li>
    <li> You cannot beat Astra, the best blades for the price, you can pay the extra 10 or 11 dollars and get 100 feathers which are also great blades, but I don&#x27;t know why you would, because I really don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Astra Platinums.  I&#x27;ve been double edge shaving for about a year.  For the first 3 months I used various razors from a large assortment that a friend had given me who had also given me the razor.  I tried the wide variety of blades and out of the selection he gave me I decided between this blade and another as my favorites.  The astras gave me a great balance of longevity, close shave, and no razor burn.  The other blade I liked was quite a bit more than this one so I bought this one instead.  For me and my old &#x27;56 Gillet handle I can&#x27;t beat the Astra Platinums.</li>
    <li> Great blades excellent price.</li>
    <li> I love the shave that I get with these razors</li>
    <li> Not as sharp or long lasting as Feather, but also not as expensive.  No irritations.</li>
    <li> These are some smooth shaving blades!  I was a little skeptical at first given the price, but they have certainly proven to be a great value.  I&#x27;ve tried Derby&#x27;s, but they cut too roughly.  I&#x27;ve also used feather&#x27;s which shaved well, but were quite a bit more expensive than these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades almost exclusively for over a year.  They are a good balance of sharp and durable.  Even though the blade is still OK after 3 shaves, I like to change it out.  $16 for a year of fresh daily shaving is great!</li>
    <li> Cheap and sharp, what more do you want.. I get three shaves out of a blade and on to a new one..I shave every day and some times twice a day..&lt;br /&gt;My 5 O&#x27;clock shadow  comes in at about noon.. Tried a sample pack from the cheapest to the most expensive, these are great.. About a dime a piece..</li>
    <li> For the price these things are great.  I&#x27;ve been through 3 of the 5 packs now (15 blades for those bad at math), and while they are sharp and perform as they should, they just aren&#x27;t sharp enough for me.  2 of those 15 blades started to pull on their first pass.  I&#x27;d suggest buying a variety pack to try some other blades, feather hasn&#x27;t pulled yet for me, so I&#x27;ll be switching to those even with the considerable price premium.  I&#x27;d rather spend the extra money for less skin irritation.  I&#x27;m not rating this 5 stars because some of the razors are perfect, just a couple weren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Fantastic blades and a fantastic price! For anyone that is thinking about switching to a safety razor the price of blades alone should be enough to convince you. Prior to switching I would spend spend $200+ a year on blades and for $10 i just got high quality blades that will last me for 2 years.</li>
    <li> first time using these bad boys and so far working great !!! saving me huge amount of money from not having to buy Gillette throw away razors. I have very hard hair on my face and these blades cut right through. They last a lot longer than lets say store bought plastic razors,even the expensive ones. stay sharp my freind</li>
    <li> Finally found a blade for me.  I recommend testing a lot of blades amazing to think they will react differently to your face but they do.  I have very sensitive skin and went to a DE because conventional razors make absolutely no sense....5 blades &#x3D; more friction with more surface area...simple science.  These blades are great they shave amd sahve smooth for my skin and again I am a 10 on the sensitive scale some other blades like shark persona have left my face in sad shape.  I also recommend Taylor of Bond Street Cream and Prorazo aftershave perfect combo and shaving is now enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Great value. You will never have to buy razor blades again</li>
    <li> Very sharp!  Handle with great care!!  Care for these the right way, Dry em, a lite oil, and they last a good, long while!!</li>
    <li> Very nice blades. Great shave. Great price!!! Makes shaving more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> These are the best double-edge blades I&#x27;ve used yet, and for the price, I see no reason to buy anything else.</li>
    <li> these are so sharp and exactly what I wanted. My hairdresser always uses double sided razors to shape my eye brows and since Im away at school I got these to do my upkeep. Its a little tricky doing it on my own, especially since these are so sharp..but they do a good job</li>
    <li> This was my second sample pack, I initially worked through a 100 pack of derby blades which are also very smooth, but not as good for me as the Astra.</li>
    <li> Great blades, great price.</li>
    <li> Recent convgs to safety razors. Ended replacements, and these were an excellent buy.  Not only are they a great price, but VERY sharp and get the job done!</li>
    <li> These blades are really sharp out of the package so I use a cork to run the blade over one time to take the edge off of it. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong with them.</li>
    <li> My husband likes to use the feather blades he says that they cannot be beat, but the price of these blades is amazing so we had to just try them out. My husbands facial hair is very coarse and these did an average job, but the difference in smoothness compared to his feather blades is huge. These blades last him about 2 shaves whereas his feather blades last him at least a week. These blades also come wrapped in wax paper and unless you have some sort of blade disposal canister these blades in the trash can be dangerous. He used these blades for about a month before we just ordered him some more Feather blades. These blades might work for you if you have fine soft facial hair, but if it is thick and coarse they aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Reviews on shaving forum were a bit mixed, but tended to weigh in on the positive side.  So far, on blade #2, I&#x27;ve only had one decent shave. The rest have all ended with multiple weepers. I&#x27;ll try a few more, but looks like I wasted my money here.  I&#x27;ll have to go back to my Israel Personna or Derby blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out different safety razor blades for the past two years, and in the end every single one failed one critical test; my mustache. No matter what, it always felt like the blades were tugging and ripping out the hair, rather than gently gliding and cutting. On the recommendation of a friend, I gave Astra a shot. I didn&#x27;t even feel the blade gliding across my upper lip as the hair was painlessly and effortlessly cut away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra has my business for the rest of my life. That&#x27;s the highest praise I could give.</li>
    <li> I use these primarily in my excellent Standard Razors Black, and no other razor/blade combo of the many I have tried gives such a close, comfortable, and effective shave.  Normally, I only attempt to get two shaves from these blades, since the third shave isn&#x27;t quite as good, but with the low price of these blades, the price per excellent shave is still among the lowest you will find anywhere.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love these blades. Close shave, long lasting and good quality! I imagine it will be a while before I have to buy new blades, but when I do, I&#x27;ll buy these again!</li>
    <li> About average blades in cut. Somes other brands cut better, some others not as close as Astra.  But I do have to shave daily and these Astra blades are less aggressive compared to some.  On Sunday&#x27;s or special occasions I use a different brand.  However, these are good for me on a day-to-day bases just going to work.</li>
    <li> For the price and quantity these blades can&#x27;t be beat. I just started DE shaving and have found these blades to be excellent. They give a nice, close shave. Obviously, you need to find what works for you; but I love these.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp and you absolutely cannot argue with the price on them.  2 years of shaving for the price of 2 months?  Count me in.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like to write bad reviews on products but after only using this for a second time shaving, I will not be using this product if I don&#x27;t need to.  I have been using blades to shave now for over 2 years and never experienced blades that were this dull....i tried with the first blade and it just felt like it was dull and didn&#x27;t give me a clean shave....I am used to getting at least 2 good shaves of a single blade...but i decided, to try with a brand new blade for my second shave to see if it was just that single blade....similar experience...I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this large count until trying the blades out for yourself...i am not saying you won&#x27;t be able to shave with these BUT I just am not a fan of the sharpness of these blades personally and I will be looking for a different product ASAP.</li>
    <li> Great value in terms of quality of blades as well as price.</li>
    <li> This is a product you can&#x27;t pass up. Well made and they stay sharp for a long time. I highly recommend these blades!!!</li>
    <li> These blades are my favorite of the few companies I have tried. I don&#x27;t have any razor bumps or cuts from these, which I almost always get.</li>
    <li> Super Sharp &amp; Clean, Keeps the edge well</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with these blades. They work the way they are suppose to. The shave is close, and comfortable</li>
    <li> Love these blades had to give a few away to friends to try and they ordered some also.</li>
    <li> These blades are very good quality and shave like a dream.  I have tried a variety of double edge razor blades, but these are hands down the best!  No tugging and pulling on hairs, just a smooth shaving experience.  These blades work flawlessly and come at a price that make it a no brainer.  Lose the multiblade razors and start shaving a like a man with these little katanas!</li>
    <li> After trying a sample pack I find these the best balance of sharpness and durability. Everyone worships Feather&#x27;s but they are the only blades that consistently give me razor burn/irritation. No complaints at all with Astra&#x27;s and they are a great value as well!</li>
    <li> These blades are a great value and deliver a great shave. I have tried multiple brands and though these aren&#x27;t the best I have used they work very well when shaving my head.</li>
    <li> These are very high quality Double Edge shaving blades at a GREAT price.  When I started shaving with double edged razors, I tried a range of different products and found the Astra Superior Platinum to be the best for my beard and budget.  I tried a few others that were much more expensive that were very good (Feathers) but almost *too* sharp, yet deteriorated quickly.  There were others that were cheaper that I liked but did not retain a sharp blade as long as the Astras.  Of course, if you are just starting your experimentation, you might find that the Astras do not meet your needs.  You should buy a range of blades and experiment for a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I determined I liked the Astras, I was thrilled to find the 100 pack for about 10 to 12 bucks.  I get two weeks out of a blade (see below) so this supply will last me roughly two years.  I&#x27;d spend the same money on Gillette or Schick cartridge blades in under a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE - you can use BOTH SIDES of a double edge razor blade, and one of the benefits of these Astras is that they have four small numerals in the corners of the blade referring to each edge (1 and 2 on one side, 3 and 4 on the other side).  More info at http://wiki.badgerandblade.com/Numbers_on_the_DE_Blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this beneficial?  Because I get a week out of each side of the blade.  I don&#x27;t pay attention to whether I use the 1 edge or the 2 edge, but I get a solid week out of the \\&quot;top\\&quot; of the blade (which I count as 1 and 2 facing me when loading the razor), then after shaving on Sunday, I flip it over so the 3 and 4 is facing me and get another solid week out of it. If you think about it, only one side of the blade (facing down when the handle is facing down) is ever doing the cutting. So the numerals help me remember whether it is a week for me to \\&quot;flip\\&quot; the blade or \\&quot;discard\\&quot; the blade.  I probably could push the one week duration for each side even longer, but I&#x27;m happy with getting two solid weeks out ofit and never cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, in response to someone&#x27;s question, I keep spent blades in a large pill bottle (childproof cap) from the pharmacy, works great, and it will take forever for me to fill it.  I have no kids in my household.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shave I have ever had. I switched to a safety razor a while back and won&#x27;t ever go back to electric or disposable blades again. These are so much cheaper than what you would normally pay for with alternatives. At 10 cents a blade, I use a new blade every time I shave and it is still a fraction of the price of something like a Mach 3 razor at $2 per blade.</li>
    <li> I placed an order for a box of 100 blades alongside the Merkur long handle safety razor. The cut of the blades and overall comfort are matched by no other brand for this price. I will continue to purchase Astra Platinum blades from now on.</li>
    <li> Nice sharp blades, they will get the job done and better than some cheaper blades out there, no complaints. keep on shavin!</li>
