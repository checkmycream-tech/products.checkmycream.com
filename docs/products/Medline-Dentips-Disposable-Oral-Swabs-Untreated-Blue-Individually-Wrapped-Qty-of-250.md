    <li> My husband had surgery for oral cancer and these swabs were very similar to the ones the hospital used.  They are soft and individually wrapped and really helped to keep his lips and tongue moisturized until he was back to normal.  Good value too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on these while searching for tooth brushes for my dogs at Drs Foster &amp; Smith and decided to try them. 2 of my dogs and all of my cats are resistant to regular tooth brushes and these make a good alternative. They are also wonderful for applying a hexachloridene dental rinse to their teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has them in larger quantities and at a much better price. Each pet has their own toothbrush and dentatip - I get a week per pet for each dentatip and then toss. For a dog or cat who has had oral surgery or a tooth cleaning, these are great to start brushing right away without hurting tender gums. They are also a great way to introduce puppies and kittens to tooth brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the pets, make SURE you order the untreated blue dentatips. Human products can be dangerous for pets so the treated ones could cause a problem for your furry friend!!</li>
    <li> We use the oral swabs on mom and it works really well.  The price is much cheaper compared to prices from medical supply place.</li>
    <li> These swabs are too bendy..weak. We also had several lose the foam end in patient&#x27;s mouth. Not good at all and a choking hazard. I threw away 500, and am making sure we order pink next time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product,love that they are individually wrapped</li>
    <li> they are ok but I really need the 7 inch plastic stick with the green sponge, the blue is a little too soft, if you have them please let me know, My 92 year old Mother is total invalid and I go through a lot of these</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my father to use when he is unable to get out of bed. They work great and also are very sturdy. I would defiantly order them again.</li>
    <li> My Dad was on Hospice and we needed some unflavored oral swabs to hydrate him as he was unable to swallow. We could not find these locally, so I ordered them on Amazon on May 23, 2013.  The Delivery estimate: May 28, 2013 - May 31, 2013.  That was 5 days away, so I emailed JDCSupplies and told them my Dad was Hospice and needed these ASAP.  They arrived the next day!  This was a life saver as we were rationing the ones we had gotten from the hospital when we took him home.  Thank you JDCSupplies for expediting this order! Had they not expedited the order the swabs would have arrived too late.  This company is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this tooteth. Each item is individually sealed. Highly recommend this product and reseller.</li>
    <li> The product was sent very quickly to my wife who is in a nursing home. I shall continue to do business with this company.</li>
    <li> I really like these swabs for my 100 yr old aunt.  They clean her gums and tongue really well .  This is the 2nd box I bought.</li>
    <li> What else could I say about these - they work perfectly, taste okay. I&#x27;ll certainly buy them again to keep at my bedside to remedy my \\&quot;dry-mouth\\&quot; I get at night (my medical condition makes my drinking water difficult).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
    <li> worked as advertised -- keeps mouth moist if you&#x27;re unable to drink liquids</li>
    <li> I have ordered and used this product before. They continue to do the job. The only criticism I would have is that they are difficult to open, requiring scissors and as a care giver that takes time. The previous order each individual package could be torn open easily.</li>
    <li> Very good quality at a very good price so rated it top at five stars.</li>
    <li> The toothetts are the sofest brushes to use in the mouth if you have removable plates.  all regular toothbrushes, even infant, are to hard on the gums.  love them</li>
    <li> Great price - enjoy having plenty on hand - they do the job of mouth swabbing very good, and are individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> This product works well for cleaning mouth for elderly,  and probably is good for cleaning other things as well at the shop.</li>

    <li> Help moisten dry mouth very well.</li>
    <li> I bought these untreated oral swabs for my bed-ridden husband who has perennial phlegm he has difficulty expelling. Apart from the suction machine that we use to suction out his phlegm, we also rely on dentips oral swabs. We use these swabs first to take out phlegm. For when his phlegm is stuck in his throat, we use the suction machine. The swabs have the right length for ease in moving around his mouth and around his teeth. Moreover, Its texture provides good surface for the phlegm to adhere to. If you need to draw out phlegm from a similarly situated patient, I would suggest using these oral swabs first. The suction machine can be resorted to if these swabs are not sufficient. The suction machine requires more expertise than these swabs. The swab is also good as a toothbrush. We use it with a good natural alcohol-free mouthwash. For good oral hygiene, I highly recommend these swabs.</li>
    <li> Items are very good and seller expedited package as promised.</li>
    <li> These are exactly as described. They work very well.</li>
    <li> These swabs are a good price value and good quality. It is my first time buying the swabs and I will buy them again.</li>
