      <li>I tried it with me and my girls and had to go and Buy more we love it</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>more orange color than bronze</li>
      <li>Many people who say that this lotion isn&#x27;t working for them..</li>
      <li>Worked better than I had anticipated.</li>
      <li>Either way, I love them both and would purchase again.</li>
      <li>Make sure you rub it in evenly though because it can make you streaky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok saw no difference</li>
      <li>Awesome product, will definitely order again!!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the shower gel, moisturizer and exfoliant.</li>
      <li>I cant say enough how awesome it works!!!  </li>
      <li>Works very well!!!!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty fair</li>
      <li>that one gives a really nice golden tan.</li>
      <li>To my surprise it&#x27;s a fabulous tanning accelerator.</li>
      <li>and my legs are incredibly smooth.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and overall great product!!</li>
      <li>I am pale skin and this has to be one of the best tanning bronzers I have used.</li>
      <li>I had purchased this before at a tanning salon and loved it, it made me nice and dark.</li>
      <li>I had tried Snooki&#x27;s Hot Bronzer before this and love everything about it.</li>
      <li>Overall really good experience with this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I will say one thing that was cool is it DOES inhibit leg hair growth</li>
      <li>Love it and it Really works.</li>
      <li>was just looking for something to help with calves as dark as the rest of me.... smelled great though</li>
      <li>Noticed a difference after first use!</li>
      <li>Helps build your tan very quick, nice golden glow also doesn&#x27;t leave you orange, also has a hair growth inhibitor that actually works very well.</li>
      <li>so I feel like it works better so far.</li>
      <li>100% worth it.</li>
      <li>I was shocked most of the time tanning products do not smell good at all!!</li>
      <li>..?? I do notice from my old bottle and my new that my old bottle smells really good</li>
      <li>This lotion made it that much easier!</li>
      <li>I think the regular lotion works much better.</li>
      <li>The first Snooki brand I have tried using.</li>
      <li>Really like this product!  </li>
      <li>And, it really does work to inhibit hair growth!  </li>
      <li>Use Zero to Sexy for legs usually and that is a whole lot better, cheaper priced and can be bought online or at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Store....</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really hope that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
      <li>I use it all over (except on my face) and it really does the trick.  </li>
      <li>This tanner is too light and doesn&#x27;t have instant color like I like.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s probably why it was so cheap, that they just fill it with regular lotion.</li>
      <li>I got this in today and went straight to the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>I really did not notice a difference in the results compared to the other Snookie lotions, which I love.</li>
      <li>I actually didn&#x27;t notice much color at all!!</li>
      <li>was a little better, but still streaked.</li>
      <li>in my bed with new bulbs.  </li>
      <li>but my new bottle I purchased off here doesn&#x27;t have a smell...</li>
      <li>and I wanted to try something new to get me over a barrier.</li>
      <li>saw results after first use and it only took one use.</li>
      <li>ive used it twice and WOW!</li>
      <li>BTW I don&#x27;t get the same streaks with her ultra dark black bronzer and Snooki in  the spot light which is my favorite cause</li>
      <li>It got my legs SUPER dark in 3-4 tans.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>However, this barely streaks at all!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> liked everything. I use not only on legs</li>
    <li> I had tried Snooki&#x27;s Hot Bronzer before this and love everything about it. I got this in today and went straight to the tanning bed. It smells WONDERFUL!! I noticed after a few hours that I had gotten a little darker on just the first tan! No streaks like I was afraid of either. I&#x27;m a Snooki believer and can&#x27;t wait to see how dark I can get!</li>
    <li> Gave me a rash all over my legs</li>
    <li> Best lotion ive ever used</li>
    <li> Worked better than I had anticipated. I honestly thought I was buying the name. To my surprise it&#x27;s a fabulous tanning accelerator. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time tanning my legs. This lotion made it that much easier! Amazing!</li>
    <li> love this! I have fair skin and freckles, not redheaded but my dad is, I will usually burn once then start tanning. ive been going about a month to the tanning bed and had got a good base tan but my legs were just not tanning like the rest of my body so thought I would give this a try. ive used the reg snooki tanning lotion and love it also. its not just the name, its actually very good products! ive used it twice and WOW! my legs are already as tan as my stomach! did not streak or make them orange. like with all bronzers you MUST wash/wipe your hands off after using. I ordered thru 1901 and bottle came sealed(under the cap) and the bottle was wrapped in plastic so if you order from 1901 you dnt have to worry about getting a fake or something that has been tampered with. also it A LOT cheaper here than the salon, if your on the fence about buying, go ahead and get it! you wont regret it!!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  This lotion made me itch. It also turned my legs orange and left little goopy beads all over my skin.</li>
    <li> OBSESSED with this lotion. I am a regular tanner and have tried just about every lotion you can think of. This was by far the best. Gave me immediate color and it smells incredible. Make sure you rub it in evenly though because it can make you streaky. Awesome product, will definitely order again!!</li>
    <li> i LOVE this stuff!!! i noticed in ONE tan the difference! i am very pleased!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok saw no difference</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this indoor tanning lotion!  And, it really does work to inhibit hair growth!  A little bit goes a long way.  I use it on the rest of my body as well.  Will continue to use this product!  Also, love the fact that Snooki&#x27;s products are cruelty-free, paraben-free, and vegan!!</li>
    <li> Love it and it Really works. I tried it with me and my girls and had to go and Buy more we love it</li>
    <li> more orange color than bronze and I&#x27;m already dark... was just looking for something to help with calves as dark as the rest of me.... smelled great though</li>
    <li> smells pretty good! color was not as dark as I was expecting and I&#x27;m pretty fair but at least it didn&#x27;t turn my skin orange!</li>
    <li> This did not make me that tan and no matter how carefully I tried there was always SOME streaking. I will say one thing that was cool is it DOES inhibit leg hair growth and my legs are incredibly smooth. BTW I don&#x27;t get the same streaks with her ultra dark black bronzer and Snooki in  the spot light which is my favorite cause it&#x27;s white and doesn&#x27;t streak or stain at all. that one gives a really nice golden tan. This is the only product of hers I wouldn&#x27;t rate as 5 stars. I absolutely love the shower gel, moisturizer and exfoliant. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again and I don&#x27;t get all the people raving about the smell - it just smells like tan lotion to me.</li>
    <li> I have tried and tried for years to get my legs to tan as dark as my other body parts!  It just never works for me!  My friend got this and recommended it so i tried it!  I cant say enough how awesome it works!!!  It smells amazing as well!!  Like candy!!  I cant stop smelling it!  After the 2nd day of using this my legs were dark as ever!!  This stuff works wonders!!  Great price! Fast shipping and overall great product!! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I used this once (I had a slight base tan) and it looks like I have been in Mexico for a week.  I&#x27;m as pale as they come (I do tan well, though).  Smells SO good too!!!!!  Don&#x27;t know yet about the hair inhibitors or the firming - will keep you posted!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! This honestly smells so good I was shocked most of the time tanning products do not smell good at all!! Helps build your tan very quick, nice golden glow also doesn&#x27;t leave you orange, also has a hair growth inhibitor that actually works very well. Can definitely be used all over also.</li>
    <li> Many people who say that this lotion isn&#x27;t working for them.. I&#x27;ve read their complete reviews &amp; it&#x27;s because many of the idiots weren&#x27;t tanning in tanning beds, they were using it as an instant sunless bronzer or trying to tan outdoors with it. Complete morons. All snooki lotions I&#x27;ve tried are wonderful but my legs always seem a shade behind, this product DEFINITELY solved that problem for me. 100% worth it.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> This tanner is too light and doesn&#x27;t have instant color like I like.  I actually didn&#x27;t notice much color at all!!</li>
    <li> Great product for legs! My legs are super hard to tan but with this lotion I can achieve the desired color without looking fake or streaky.</li>
    <li> Works instantly, gives you a bronze shimmer and it&#x27;s smells so freaking good!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this before at a tanning salon and loved it, it made me nice and dark. I just received this ^ today and my friend told me that It could be fake that&#x27;s probably why it was so cheap, that they just fill it with regular lotion. I really hope that isn&#x27;t the case. ..?? I do notice from my old bottle and my new that my old bottle smells really good but my new bottle I purchased off here doesn&#x27;t have a smell...</li>
    <li> The first Snooki brand I have tried using. I&#x27;m not a big fan of bronzers due to streaking. However, this barely streaks at all! Also, I get darker faster. I am pale skin and this has to be one of the best tanning bronzers I have used. I do not just use for legs, if you want a bronzer without streaking this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Really like this product!  I use it all over (except on my face) and it really does the trick.  After 3-4 times in the tanning bed, I could totally see a big difference!  My goal was tanning a couple times a week for 2 months before going to Cancun.  I got a great base tan with this product and didn&#x27;t burn at all on vacation!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Gives great color on legs</li>
    <li> Works REALLY good!! It got my legs SUPER dark in 3-4 tans. Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve found in my 15 years of going to tanning salons!!</li>
    <li> 2 great price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Overall really good experience with this lotion.  But this feels and smells like another Supre lotion, Selfie.  Anybody else notice this?  Either way, I love them both and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works very well!!!! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> This will make your legs darker, but it seems to streak them. I even tried rubbing it in better... was a little better, but still streaked. And if it minimizes hair growth, I can&#x27;t tell. I think the regular lotion works much better.</li>
    <li> I really did not notice a difference in the results compared to the other Snookie lotions, which I love. I think the other tanning lotion has the same effect.</li>
    <li> Works great! saw results after first use and it only took one use. With maintenance it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; kind of lotion. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product smells great!!</li>
    <li> So I use solid black by millenium and I wanted to try something new to get me over a barrier. Well I don&#x27;t know if this is it or not yet I will update in a few days. However. It smells really good. And the brozers are nice. The lotion is a brown color so I feel like it works better so far. I don&#x27;t get my stuff at a salon bc I don&#x27;t go to one. I have a commercial tanning bed in my home so I use Amazon and I have never had an issue with fake. My bottle came with a seal under the cap and a plastic wrapping seal over the bottle.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE PURCHASED THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> Love it! Noticed a difference after first use!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, used it and couldn&#x27;t even tell after 15 mins. in my bed with new bulbs.  Use Zero to Sexy for legs usually and that is a whole lot better, cheaper priced and can be bought online or at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Store....</li>
