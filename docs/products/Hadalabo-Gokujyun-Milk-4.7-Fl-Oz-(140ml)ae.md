### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and i like this one the best because it does not contain alcohol.</li>
      <li>This lotion is great.</li>
      <li>That is a great way to use hyaluronic acid.  </li>
      <li>this is a great lotion to use before putting on spf.</li>
      <li>The bottle lasted me for 10 months so moneywise it is a great deal.</li>
      <li>This stuff feels great and even has a nice dewy look on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I like it, and it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>Good under makeup but not moisturizing .</li>
      <li>If it does more than that, it&#x27;s a bonus!  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to go with the ever popular Hada Labo hydrating toner, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
      <li>Very nice light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a great layering moisturizer with lots of lubricious slip, and absorbs quickly with ultra lightweight feel.</li>
      <li>After I have found my ideal skincare routine it changed towards normal.</li>
      <li>but you can layer more than one HL product.</li>
      <li>I decided to check out the milk, which is more like like a lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love Hada Labo products.</li>
      <li>and so there are so many lotions and moisturizers</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so much better</li>
      <li>I see it more as a product you use with the lotion not alone.  </li>
      <li>- it helps to lock in the moisture and hydrates even more.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, Lotion Light is enough for me most of the time, but sometimes I use Milky Lotion and Cream on top of it too</li>
      <li>and I bought Lotion Light, Milky Lotion and Cream.</li>
      <li>The milk is a great second choice as it is indeed milky and seals in the toner.  </li>
      <li>If you like getting  compliments on having fantastic skin-</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>I first got the Hada Labo lotion, which is more of toner,  which is so poular.  </li>
      <li>The seller is sweet, shipped a candy for gift.</li>
      <li>Great for humid climates or oily skin that can&#x27;t take heavy moisturizers.</li>
      <li>already* getting the hyaluronic acid from the clear lotion, right?---so adding the Milky one on top seems extraneous.</li>
      <li>Great texture, just the right amount of hydration without being heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>It strangely isn&#x27;t that effective alone for me.  </li>
      <li>My favorite moisturizer currently.</li>
      <li>But i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a must-have, especially if you own the clear Lotion Moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin hydrated and soft, no greasy shine.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use the whole line</li>
      <li>it is so gentle, that i can also use it under my eyes.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why the Milky Lotion is less popular than the clear Lotion</li>
      <li>But being water-based, the clear Lotion Moist doesn&#x27;t have the retention properties to lock all that goodness in.</li>
      <li>and my skin feels so soft and plump.  </li>
      <li>Your skin can only absorb so much hyaluronic.</li>
      <li>Use it everyday and it leaves me so fresh!</li>
      <li>it leaves my dry and sensitive skin very moist.</li>
      <li>If my skin suddenly gets very dry and flaky (well, even more than usually) - it work very well.</li>
      <li>I am dry skinned and sensitive but can break out from oils</li>
      <li>I use this product for several times, seems a little bit heavy at the beginning of apply, but after a while, it makes your skin comfortable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I first got the Hada Labo lotion, which is more of toner,  which is so poular.  I decided to check out the milk, which is more like like a lotion.  You don&#x27;t need to use the whole line but you can layer more than one HL product. The milk is a great second choice as it is indeed milky and seals in the toner.  The lotion is watery but slightly viscous and you patt it into damp skin as a hydrating toner.  That is a great way to use hyaluronic acid.  This is like a very thin , but not viscous or sticky going in like the other.  Similar ingredients, doesn&#x27;t seem to work the same but amplifies the effects in a big way.  It strangely isn&#x27;t that effective alone for me.  I thought it might be a thicker stronger option. I see it more as a product you use with the lotion not alone.  I will say adding this layer is a big game changer for me though.  I have redness and it&#x27;s so much better and my skin feels so soft and plump.  I am dry skinned and sensitive but can break out from oils and so there are so many lotions and moisturizers I can&#x27;t use on my face. This is a keeper for me. I feel like my skin barrier is repaired. So my skin is happier.  I love Hada Labo products.</li>
    <li> i have tried the majority of Rohto-Hada hyaluronic serums and lotions and i like this one the best because it does not contain alcohol. it leaves my dry and sensitive skin very moist. it is so gentle, that i can also use it under my eyes. this is a great lotion to use before putting on spf.</li>
    <li> If you like getting  compliments on having fantastic skin- you&#x27;ll enjoy this product. Works on  both combination and dry skin</li>
    <li> Horrible awful stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff feels great and even has a nice dewy look on my skin.  If it does more than that, it&#x27;s a bonus!  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this with the toner. Took care of my dry patches. I&#x27;m sticking with this line. I recommend the foam cleanser too.</li>
    <li> Very nice light moisturizer. A bit sticky after application but fear not! It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin hydrated and soft, no greasy shine. It improved the texture of my skin after couple of days of regular use. I have normal skin prone to occasional dryness, however I used to have plain dry skin. After I have found my ideal skincare routine it changed towards normal. I tend to think that it is largely due to this milky lotion. The bottle lasted me for 10 months so moneywise it is a great deal. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> The item came 5 days earlier than scheduled date, total around 20 days to ship. I use this product for several times, seems a little bit heavy at the beginning of apply, but after a while, it makes your skin comfortable.The seller is sweet, shipped a candy for gift. Tks!</li>
    <li> Like this product but prefer the gel.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I bought Lotion Light, Milky Lotion and Cream. Surprisingly, Lotion Light is enough for me most of the time, but sometimes I use Milky Lotion and Cream on top of it too - it helps to lock in the moisture and hydrates even more. If my skin suddenly gets very dry and flaky (well, even more than usually) - it work very well.</li>
    <li> Basic moisturizer, leaves face looking shiny/greasy. If you&#x27;re looking for something to go with the ever popular Hada Labo hydrating toner, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. It&#x27;s a bit thicker than the moist. It also seems to offer a longer lasting feeling of moisture on my face.</li>
    <li> Known as the &amp;#34;ignored, less-favored&amp;#34; sister of the Hada Labo family. It has the same patented Hyaluronic Acid complex as the star-of-the-show [[ASIN:B00BSNBO9O Rohto Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Moist 5.7floz/170ml]], and is just as functional---but the base is composed like a oil/water emulsion that gives it a milky, creamier texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lotion Moist, in contrast, is a clear, watery liquid with low viscosity -- thus able to penetrate skin faster than the heavier Milky Lotion. But being water-based, the clear Lotion Moist doesn&#x27;t have the retention properties to lock all that goodness in. That&#x27;s where a regular moisturizer steps in, like the Milky Lotion. An emulsion does this job by adding a slightly occlusive layer of moisture, that seals in all the Hyaluronic yumminess, while preventing it from evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you could technically use any moisturizer you like that acts as an occlusive cover -- i mean, you&#x27;re *already* getting the hyaluronic acid from the clear lotion, right?---so adding the Milky one on top seems extraneous. Your skin can only absorb so much hyaluronic. Besides, we like to use other moisturizers that offer different ingredients, like peptides and antioxidants. That&#x27;s why the Milky Lotion is less popular than the clear Lotion Moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do buy this, it&#x27;s a great layering moisturizer with lots of lubricious slip, and absorbs quickly with ultra lightweight feel. Great for humid climates or oily skin that can&#x27;t take heavy moisturizers. I like it, and it&#x27;s a good product. But i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a must-have, especially if you own the clear Lotion Moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you run out, this comes in a refill pouch which is less expensive: [[ASIN:B00BS3Q228 Rohto Hada-Labo Goku-jun Hyaluronic Milky Lotion Refill 140ml / 4.7 floz. (Japan Import)]]. One refill pouch fills up an entire empty bottle.</li>
    <li> Good under makeup but not moisturizing .</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer currently.</li>
    <li> Didnt see a difference, skin was still dry. I&#x27;m asian for reference</li>
    <li> Great texture, just the right amount of hydration without being heavy or greasy. Use it everyday and it leaves me so fresh! Would definitely repurchase.</li>
