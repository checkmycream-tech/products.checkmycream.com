<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used Dream by Gap for many years and this time I am totally disappointed by the strength of the smell. Is like alcohol with a very very soft scent. My dream mist is much stronger.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this perfume at the Gap all the time, I was so dissapointed when they no longer carried it. I just happen to look on Amazon to see if they had it and they do! this is my second order of dream, it smells so clean and not over powering. Thanks Amazon! Shpping was free and quick, I will order again.</li>
    <li> My favorite gap scent!!! Great price, always get tons of compliments when I wear it. Very fresh and light, clean  like a fresh breeze.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. I am sensitive to smells and this stuff is a dream truly to a person like me. It is a nice fresh clean smell and last.</li>
    <li> GAP DREAM MADE A GREAT XMAS GIFT ESPECIALLY SINCE GAP DISCONTINUED THIS ITEM MANY YEARS AGO. MY GIRL REALLY ENJOYED IT.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this perfume and I loved purchasing at a lower cost ont his site rather than in the store.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The bottle is very pretty and made out of glass, so there&#x27;s not to much worry if u happen to drop it cause the glass is pretty thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts a long time, I get up at 6:30am and by 2:00pm I can still smell it, obviously it doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as wen you first put it on cause clearly no perfume is like that, but you can still smell it and if you hug someone they&#x27;ll be able to smell it also&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would deffinitaly buy this again</li>
    <li> Wife prefers &amp;#34;Dream More&amp;#34; - so her friends will be getting this for birthday presents...</li>
    <li> Nice perfume I always have one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice perfume..... It&#x27;s too bad was discontinued</li>
    <li> I just turned 30 this past January and have been in a reminiscing sort of mood so I decided to purchase a fragrance I used to wear in high school. \\&quot;Dream\\&quot; was HUGE in the late 90&#x27;s/2000&#x27;s and as soon as I sprayed this on I was immediately swept back to those awkward days. It still smells just as good as I remember even though the product has actually been discontinued for awhile. I hope that GAP decides to bring it back at some point. It&#x27;s such a sweet fragrance. :)</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  I get compliments every time I wear it!!!!</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this on AMAZON but unfortunately the smell is not the way it used to be.. Even I sprayed for like 5x the smell don&#x27;t last long like before..</li>
    <li> Glad I can still find somewhere to buy this.</li>
    <li> great, it is the actual gap perfume. excellent product love it</li>
    <li> I always order it for her when it is time to visit the family in Brazil. I personally never tried but my sister is a very trend yet sophisticated woman, so I believe it must be a great product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to find my favorite fragrance before it&#x27;s all gone after being discontinued! When you find a fragrance you like it&#x27;s sad to hear that it&#x27;s being discontinued!</li>
    <li> love that this is the real dream from the gap.....the smell is amazing</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite fragrances!  Wish it was more widely available!  I will order more if I can!</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume that I can wear without it making my throat hurt or eyes water. Love the scent, not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I used Dreams over 10 years ago and always wanted to get it but couldnt find it at any GAP store. I was very happy to find it online. It smells very good and reminds me of the original smell, however it is definetly not the same. Also the smell doesnt last for long.</li>
    <li> Came early. Perfect!!</li>
    <li> Worn this scent for years.  Still smells as good as the first time I tried the tester at Gap ages ago.  Would recommend the product, and the seller.</li>
    <li> well priced and my mom loved it for mothers day. This is her favorite perfume! i think it smells like fruit loops but as long as shes happy with it.</li>
    <li> When this perfume was sold at the Gap, I would buy the perfume and body spray.  They were sold in a handy purse size too! I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;Heaven&amp;#34; and just kept coming back to this one.  It&#x27;s not too sweet, not too strong and not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s my favorite everyday perfume!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff, can&#x27;t buy in stores anymore, nice light fragrance</li>
    <li> Glad to find this perfume for my daughter. She has always loved it. I am glad to find Amazon and this perfume. It fullfilled a wish for her Birthday. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> So devastated to find out that Gap discontinued my beloved Dream Perfume.  Thankfully, this was the real deal and I can enjoy it for a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> Not the original! The smell is not good... So disappointed!</li>
    <li> brings me back to high school but still love this scent</li>
    <li> It is a great everyday scent.  It&#x27;s not to strong or overpowering.  Great light sweet scent.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this in highschool and I loved it.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a new scent and when I found this on amazon I ordered it immediately. Its still a nice scent but I think I&#x27;ve outgrown it.  Its a little too floral, but definitely not heavy.  I&#x27;d still recommend this scent to anyone.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased to find original item at such great price.  Very pleased with quick shipping.  My husband could not believe I was able to find his favorite scent.  Wish they never discontinued Gap Dream but sure am glad we have option to purchase it from great sites.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! Very sad it has been discontinued. Glad Amazon could help me stock up.</li>
    <li> It is a really a pity they stopped these - were my favorite thing to get from Gap!</li>
    <li> excelent condition, just how they said, love it</li>
    <li> it is not the original Gap Dream!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product since high school ( Im in my 30&#x27;s now) and trust me this is nothing like the original one from the store.You will even notice that the bottle is slightly different after you take it out of the box. Smell might be a little similar but its overwhelmed by alcohol and lasts no longer that 2 min.&lt;br /&gt;I guess its time for a new fave one...too bad ;(</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Went to the GAP to purchase, and they no longer carry it! Or at least at the time, it wasn&#x27;t available. Went online, and purchased right away.  One of my favorite scents.  As long as I can find it online, I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> AS ALWAYS ARRIVED ON TIME AND MY PARFUM I LIKE THE BEST IS DREAM GAP FOREVER</li>
    <li> I got this one year and smells good.  Lasted about 2 hours! Did guys really like smelling this one? It&#x27;s a nice blue color too.</li>
    <li> i was just reminicing about old fragrances i wore back in highschool and was so excited to find this.  I love it and it smells just as amazing as i remember it.</li>
    <li> It has been over a decade since our family shopping trip to Chicago&#x27;s Gap store and my mother fell in love with this scent. Dream by Gap arrived right before Xmas, in box, and packaged safely.</li>
    <li> wonderful buy, excellent price! I am so glad I shopped around and didnt have to go to the mall !</li>
    <li> In love with this fragrance. Uff smell so good I like it very mucho!!! I recommended for anyone to buy it..</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  It is very light.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Dream cologne and lotion.  The smell is wonderful, clean, light, and slightly flowery without being nauseating.  I always get lots of compliments when I wear it even from strangers.  I have hard time finding scents that smell good on my skin or that don&#x27;t make me want to throw up by the end of the day but this one is perfect.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they ever stop making it.</li>
    <li> This product is of good quality. Unfornatunately I ordered the wrong fragrancy. The one I really wanted was DRAM MORE. But it&#x27;s OK, it was my fault. Thank you.</li>
    <li> the package of the perfume was beatiful and no doubt the smell its good the glass is very delicated its not expensive at all compare with the other</li>
    <li> She tried it for the first time and she likes it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 10+ years. It smells amazing and always get compliments. My girls love the body mist and use it every day for school (4 and 6 year old).</li>
    <li> all good, 100% recommended</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for years and when the local Gap store closed I had to turn to online to get it. I bought 3 at one time so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay shipping and handling over and over. Great choice since its been almost a year and i an just now reaching the end of my 3rd bottle. Almost time to stock up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great light scent that does not overpower. They also have the body spray which I also use from time to time.</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent got 20 years now.gap is discontinuing it but it is just as we&#x27;ll. I ordered it and was sadly disappointed in the alcohol content. The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour. I emailed gap about the lack of a quality product that it used to be and they had no apologies just a suggestion to return or exchange at their store.</li>
    <li> Its been years since ive smelt this perfume,&lt;br /&gt;but when i received it (on time) i was honestly kiiindof&lt;br /&gt;disappointed..The smell just wasn&#x27;t what i remembered,&lt;br /&gt;its extremely light, which is okay but it wears off very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong its a familiar smell. And it does smell great,&lt;br /&gt;i just hate that after spraying myself like 10 x&#x27;s it still wears off.</li>
    <li> I am SO glad I was able to find this! I used to wear this years ago and was sad when they stopped selling this in Gap stores. I love this scent!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this perfume, knowing they stopped manufacturing it years ago and wondering if this would be the real thing.  It smells just as I remember it from high school, and it comes sealed in the original box.  I&#x27;ve never found anything that matches the fragrance, light and fruity/floral and not overpowering. I am very pleased with this purchase and might go ahead and order another bottle!</li>
    <li> I am a perfume addict but for some reason I always come back to this scent by gap which is very affordable. I love spraying it on my clothes and in my hair for it to last longer throughout the day. I have loved this scent since college and find it to be very office friendly and appropriate for the day time and night time. LOVE THIS SCENT!!! I have also tried the Pink one which is great but feels a bit young since I am 25 and enjoy less citrus scents. However pink is very refreshing if you love Grapefruit, that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like!</li>
    <li> It smells nothing like the perfume is supposed to.  Im thinking its been repackaged and refilled.  This is so disappointing. Never again!</li>
    <li> I must order more. this is by far my ultimate favorite scent from GAP!! HANDS DOWN. I will definitley order 2 more!</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume a great deal in college, and like others seem to, I find it nostalgic, though it&#x27;s not the sort of thing that I like to wear now. The most prominent note in this perfume seems to be the orange flower. It&#x27;s fairly sweet and fairly floral. I miss the old packaging.  I loved the frosted glass bottles with the icons.</li>
    <li> It was hard to find for a while, but I love it and am looking forward to using it again :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this perfume in many years and forgot how great it smelled...I am only giving it 4 stars because the bottle was leaking when I got it and about 1/4 of the product was gone....a shame.It&#x27;s a great happy daytime fragrance..I even wear to the gym..very light.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents and so sad that Gap does not sell it so to find it on Amazon has been great!! I am about to run out so I will definitely be ordering another bottle soon! The price is great also!</li>
    <li> Super fast on shipping.. product is great ..that&#x27;s y I bought it!</li>
    <li> Just what i expected....</li>
    <li> Favorite subtle floral scent. Can only find it here. Great to wear all day</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 bottles. One smelt just perfect and well the other well let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s not the same. I have worn this sent for over 10 years so I feel like I know it well. The &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; sent isn&#x27;t bad just alittle stronger.</li>
    <li> Customer service was spot on, product doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it used to but it will remain my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Smaller bottle yet more expensive than I remember from a few years back.  Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long after application.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent! I get lots of complements on how fresh &amp; clean it smells!</li>
    <li> Just as I remember from high school - I&#x27;m so glad I found this scent again 15 years later!</li>
    <li> I love Dream.  It makes me feel fifteen again.  It&#x27;s such a fun scent.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it!</li>
    <li> This scent is wonderful I used to wear it in high school and when I found it on here I was overjoyed. It one of those fragrances that is great any time of the year and its not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, but the cap is messed up, so it leaks.</li>
    <li> Best smell ever! Came even faster then I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Had been wearing this for years....lost the bottle....found the bottle and fell back in love with the fragrance! Just had to by&#x3D;uy more. Can&#x27;t get to the mall. This is convenient</li>
    <li> the perfume is awesome but the top doesnt top on the bottle so how would i carry it out of town.....................</li>
