      <li>looks cute to me).</li>

      <li>Super cute...</li>
      <li>big deal lol)</li>
      <li>She must find them comfortable as she doesn&#x27;t fuss in them.</li>
      <li>My 6-month old daughter looked so cute in them!</li>
      <li>I love a cute solid hair bow and this one definitely fit the bill.  </li>

      <li>Absolutely love them they are soft headbands</li>
      <li>soft and adorable, just as described</li>
      <li>The bands were the perfect size but the bows were so poorly made.</li>
      <li>&amp; ships super fast!</li>
      <li>They also came super fast!</li>
      <li>They look very nice not cheap at all!</li>
      <li>They look like a good quality product, but they slide off my very average size toddler&#x27;s head all the time.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Such a steal with how many you get for the price.</li>
      <li>I am so upset because they are cute, and I am pretty sure that all of these are coming from the same or similar people in China.</li>
      <li>but I can fix it because they are just hot glued.</li>
      <li>They fit my 3 month old&#x27;a head very well and has room to grow in them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and we&#x27;ll made!</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
      <li>Two problems though; a couple in my package are coming apart and on most of them, one side of the bow is much bigger than the other...</li>
      <li>Between my 18 month old taking hers off, and my 2 y/o playing dress up.  </li>
      <li>These headbands are well worth the money I spent on them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not tight either.</li>
      <li>The entire bow has completely become detached, and the glue is loose on most of the other ones.  </li>
      <li>They look absolutely adorbale in the pic; however, they are extremely cheap and poorly made.  </li>
      <li>One side of the bow was often about twice as large as the other side.</li>
      <li>Just the right size, not too big or small.</li>

    <li> Love these for my 6 month old daughter!  They look very nice not cheap at all! It&#x27;s very soft and we&#x27;ll made!</li>
    <li> Super cute and soft! They look just like the picture! They also came super fast! Only problem is the red one broke the second I put it on her but I can fix it because they are just hot glued. Overall though I&#x27;m very happy. They fit my 3 month old&#x27;a head very well and has room to grow in them.</li>
    <li> Just got it the other day and it&#x27;s exactly as pictured. My 6-month old daughter looked so cute in them! Just the right size, not too big or small. It&#x27;s not tight either. It will math a lot of her outfits!</li>
    <li> Not only for babies.&lt;br /&gt;My 5yo daughter love them!!!!</li>
    <li> I love a cute solid hair bow and this one definitely fit the bill.  I&#x27;d recommend these for purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item.  They look absolutely adorbale in the pic; however, they are extremely cheap and poorly made.  Between my 18 month old taking hers off, and my 2 y/o playing dress up.  Three of them have already come apart.  The entire bow has completely become detached, and the glue is loose on most of the other ones.  I started to just grab a glue gun because the bow are so cute, butI&#x27;m over it.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to keep reattaching these bows.  I am so upset because they are cute, and I am pretty sure that all of these are coming from the same or similar people in China.</li>
    <li> Beautiful head bands they look great on my baby and fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a neat product. I purchased them on recommendation from the family blog for The Gardener Quad Squad. They look like a good quality product, but they slide off my very average size toddler&#x27;s head all the time. Guess it depends more on head shape than circumference, etc.</li>
    <li> Adorable! They&#x27;re a great price! They don&#x27;t leave big indents in baby&#x27;s head. I do wish there was an option for ordering more colors.</li>
    <li> These bows are so cute on my baby girl. I read some of the other reviews and I was a little wary of purchasing them, but I figured the price is so good I might as well give it a try. Yes they had a little glue on them but all I did was pull it off (big deal lol) and the bow wasn&#x27;t proportioned exactly perfect but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s supposed to be(still looks cute to me). Lastly I had one on my daughters head for a few hours and it left no marks! (I was worried about that possibility) and it has plenty of room for her head to grow more without an issue she&#x27;s 3 months with a head circumference of 38cm-40cm LOVE THESE BOWS!!</li>
    <li> soft and adorable, just as described</li>
    <li> These bows are adorable.. Two problems though; a couple in my package are coming apart and on most of them, one side of the bow is much bigger than the other... A tad disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love these! Perfect size and very soft and stretchy! Perfect colors for every outfit!</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price! They fit and look adorable on my 2-month old</li>
    <li> Love them! My little bald baby girl&#x27;s best friend :)</li>
    <li> Adorable, love the colors and quality. Not too tight.</li>
    <li> Love these!!! Perfect size for my baby since she was born and she is now 3 months! Everyone compliments how cute and perfect they are!</li>
    <li> Smaller than advertised</li>
    <li> HIGHLY recommended. These are so cute! They are everyone&#x27;s fav headbands on my baby. Such a steal with how many you get for the price. I like how the bow doesn&#x27;t match the band because of this, the bows truly match all of her outfits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean really... Look at these photos-- adorable! Lol!!!!</li>
    <li> I had to return these. The bands were the perfect size but the bows were so poorly made. One side of the bow was often about twice as large as the other side. They looked terrible. If the bows had been symmetrical, I would give them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These are gorgeous! Love them!</li>
    <li> These bows were very poor quality and half of them did not even look like bows - they did not look like the pictures at all</li>
    <li> Super cute...these fit my 6-month-old very well.  (Head is average size; they&#x27;re not too tight or too loose.)</li>
