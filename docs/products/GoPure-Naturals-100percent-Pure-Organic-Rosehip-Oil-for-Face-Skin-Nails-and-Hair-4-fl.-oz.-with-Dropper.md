<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great transaction.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this oil. It has tremendously helped with my oily skin, I no longer need a primer under my make up, it actually works better than a primer. It has helped with my deep forehead lines and my fine lines have pretty much vanished. I am so happy with my purchase and will continue with this company.</li>
    <li> As described, packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had about 2 weeks with this stuff now, and So far its been good to my skin, I apply it over night and I wake up with my skin feeling Soft and hydrated. I also use it in the morning on my face, before applying make up, and it leaves my skin with a nice smooth glow. So far so Good!</li>
    <li> I have been using this the last few weeks as a go to dry oil, it&#x27;s good for everything from your face to your body to your hair to scars.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a dropper so you can either get a few drops at a tie for face or hair use or pour some into your palm for larger application areas like your body. The HUGE 4 oz bottle is also dark so it maintains it&#x27;s efficacy; however to keep it at it&#x27;s most effective, I recommend storing either in the refrigerator or a cool dark place- i:e- not your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan, as I&#x27;ve stated multiple times, of natural and organic products as well as multitasking products. Putting this on my legs after shaving made them feel INSANELY soft and smooth, and using this at night under my moisturizer left my skin glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I applied a few drops of this to the ends of my hair and it tamed my split ends. I&#x27;m looking at my hair right now, and I honestly can&#x27;t even see them. (Wow, do I need a haircut!)&lt;br /&gt;My fave use so far has got to be how it&#x27;s making the scars on my foot feel. I had some really major surgery on my foot a few months ago that left positively enormous scars that hurt like heck as the skin fights to stretch and heal. The itching gets so intense that it wakes me up sometimes, but i can put this oil on it and it absorbs immediately and brings up to 12 hours of relief. Ahhhhhhhhh.......And the price? You have to be kidding. This is ridonk cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this to review, but this is absolutely 100% my opinion!</li>
    <li> Dissapointed, the bottle was opened.</li>
    <li> I had never used rosehip oil before getting this. I have some acne scarring on my face as well as having overly dry skin. This oil has done wonderful things to fade my acne scars after even a few days! They aren&#x27;t completely gone but they are less noticeable. I use it in the evenings before bed and it keeps my face moisturized all night.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my skin was dry. I am using it for two weeks now. I apply it to my face every day and every other day to my body. I like the way it penetrate into my skin. I am 189lb and have issues if I am walking for a long period of time dressed with skirt because my skin get irritated and start hurts. When I apply just a few drops of the oil on the problem area I don&#x27; t have any issues all day long. Furthermore my tan looks even and my skin is soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> this is a absolutely awesome product i use it on my babies skin and on my stretch marks it works great it has helped with my stretch marks by making it not so noticeable and so dark.also the people were fast and prompt and sent the product right out i received it in 2 days tysvm goPure Naturals.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Love the way it dissolves quickly and leaves your skin soft and your hair shinny and healthy. And it doesn&#x27;t have any smell.A very natural way to be beautiful.</li>
    <li> my skin looks so much better</li>
    <li> After doing a little more research on this oil, I am loving it lots more...&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t smell like roses, but the quality of this oil won my favor. It&#x27;s absorption is a lot slower than other oils that are currently in my arsenal, so when I need an essential oil to stay topically a little longer, this is now my go-to. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but a little goes a long way, I use VERY sparingly. I also use as a pre-shaving lotion, and on my feet after running at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;*purchased product with a discount code</li>
    <li> I was trying this product after I&#x27;ve been using another one.  I didn&#x27;t like this one at all.  It seemed like it was diluted and didn&#x27;t have any scent of rosehip whatsoever like the other brand I&#x27;ve been using.  I also seemed watery in comparison.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great product.I like to use Rosehip oil on my face and does not irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> Omg the bottle was huge!!!  I started using this to reduce stretch marks from over 25 years ago. You can feel it penitrading in your skin the moment you start rubbing. I am not expecting them to just disappear but at least fade.  I will update when the bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it for my hair. It goes easy and absorbs fast. It also smells good. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought rosehip seed oil several times in the past, and this oil does not have the distinctive smell and amber color of rosehip seed oil.&lt;br /&gt; There is no official logo that shows that this oil is organic as claimed. I return it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I used it on a dry patch on one elbow -it&#x27;s now gone. I am now using it on feet &amp; ankles, they feel so good.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome!!!  Skin is soft and it gives me a glowing appearance.....just what my skin needed......love it!</li>
    <li> perfect for my skin,save my money too.</li>
    <li> My first time trying Rosehip Oil and I&#x27;m sold. The oil absorbs very nicely into my skin with no residue. The bottle says to wait a few weeks to see a difference but it evened out my skin tone and reduced redness the very first time I used it. I am a natural redhead living in the Southwest and am constantly trying to stay moisturized and reduce the uneven tone and redness in my face. Overall I am very happy with this product and will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, pale yellow clear thin liquid with absolutely no smell.  It glides onto skin and absorbs like a dream, instantly.  Excellent for delicate facial tissue.  Even under the eyes, it is not irritating and does not leave behind grease.  Could use before putting on concealer/makeup as an excellent source of nutrients for keeping skin healthy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! 100% Pure Rosehip oil! Great for the face and the hair! What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Before I received this rosehip oil, I&#x27;ve done some research and found so much positive articles about it. When I received it, I just can&#x27;t to wash my hands first then replace it with the glass dropper and of course apply it on my skin. It is truly an amazing oil that soaks into the skin easily and not leave a greasy residue. No special aroma comes from it, which proves that it&#x27;s 100% pure natural rosehip oil with no fillers. Now I start applying rosehip oil on my face every morning before any moisturizer and sunblocks, hope the face could get the most benefits from it, reduced the scars, hydrate dry skin and reduce the wrinkles and fine lines. Glad to order the product with a discount, love it!</li>
    <li> Rose hip oil is wonderful and good for many uses.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best oils on the market. I really like the smell of it and it works great</li>
    <li> This rosehip oil feels wonderful on my skin and absorbs very well.  It has no scent and could easily be used as a carrier oil for other scents.  I use it plain however on my face and body and love how moisturizing it is.  A great product!</li>
    <li> I have had a nasty burn scar on my hand for almost a year now... I&#x27;ve tried all different types of natural oils to reduce the scar, but so far this is absolutely the most effective. I can&#x27;t speak to any of its other benefits, but the scar on my hand is almost completely faded after only three weeks of using this rosehip oil (applied directly every day - usually about twice a day). Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> After using the organic rosehip oil for about two weeks now, I have noticed a slight difference in the smoothness of my skin and a radiance that has not been there for years. I knew I had a bought a great product when my husband asked my what I was doing different to my face, it looked good.  The oil goes on easily and it only takes a few drops. What I really like most is how soft my face feels after using rosehip oil for only a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a week now.  I have used rosehip oil before in other brands and they had a strong scent.  This rosehip oil has no scent at all, so I hope it is really rosehip oil in the bottle.  So far so good.  I use it on my face as a moisturizer and I look forward to seeing how my face looks after a month of using this.</li>
    <li> Mrs C: I&#x27;m using this blended with the sweet almond oil and a few drops of rose oil for a facial moisturizer. It&#x27;s lovely!</li>
    <li> Bought this for the dry skin on my face and eczema on my upper arm. I have only been using it a few weeks, but it does seem to be helping, slowly but surely. I would buy again. Good amount of product for the price, should last a while!</li>
    <li> Love love love! The smell is divine and it feels amazing on the skin. I did a lot of research and price comparisons and this one was my best choice. I am very pleased with this brand, seller, and purchase.</li>
    <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into skin well. It leaves skin feeling oily unlike other brands of rosehip oil I have tried. If it had been the first time trying rosehip oil I think I would have liked it. Not a bad product, just won&#x27;t use on my face.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best products I have ever used. I have very dry and sensitive skin and I do not like to use “chemically based” products. I apply the oil in the morning and before bed time. My skin stayed moisturized throughout the night. I always have a lot of freckles when I come back from the sun and this oil seems to blend them with my skin so they are not so visible.&lt;br /&gt;I will also mention that I had allergic reaction on my cleavage (bad perfumes) that caused small rash and after applying the oil on it, it was gone after 3 days. Again, I didn’t have to use any medication nor chemically produced creams.  It is natural and my skin really stays smooth for very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 2 weeks and I love it. I am hoping after few months I will see even more improvements with my skin…</li>
    <li> 4 ounces of pure gold. I have very dry skin and cant get enough of this product. The bottle looks much smaller on the ad and I was pleasantly surprised to find out in fact how large it was. This is a must have product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about rosehip oil! I recently (within the past few months) started using rosehip oil religiously on my face after showering and my skin has never felt better. I never really liked to use anything on my face but I started noticing my face getting extremely oily by the end of the day. A friend of mine suggested using a combination of using toner and an oil like rosehip or argan on my face. This greatly helped control the oiliness. This rosehip oil from goPURE Naturals comes in a pretty big bottle and is virtually odorless. I love that it comes with it&#x27;s own glass dropper as well. I can honestly say it compares equally to the bottle I paid over $40 for! It absorbs quickly into the skin and feels great. Just keep in mind a little goes a long way! This bottle should last you quite a while even if you use it several times a day. I usually use 2-3 drops on my face and I&#x27;m good to go for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I&#x27;ve been using it as my facial moisturizer morning and night for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve already noticed my fine lines are starting to fade. I need to wait about 30 minutes in the morning for it to absorb before I can apply my make up but that is no big deal, especially when I&#x27;m seeing such great results. I also love the dark glass bottle with eye dropper.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about putting oil on my acne prone skin. I tried the coconut oil and my skin went nuts :( I know it works for many people but not me. So I was really skeptical about putting this on. Omg my.skin loves this oil. It drinks it up!! I have not broken out from it at all!! Just the opposite my.acne is going away. I do have some fine lines they are diminishing. My skin feels more supple. Under my eyes my skin seems to Be plumped up. I do use this with my peels. I do lactic acid and glycolic peels. I am doing my glycolic peel tonight and this will definitely speed up the healing. I know this because I had a pimple popped it caused damage :( but in three days the pimple was gone along with the damage I did to my face. Ok I am a believer now in the rosehip seed oil. I love this stuff!! It should be in every woman&#x27;s skin routine forever!! I am 41 with a newborn son. If I can fit this in to my routine anyone can. I use it morning and at night. It also mixes well with your vit c serum and your cream. Just allow 5 minutes before each so your skin can absorb it. I do my vit c serum then my.rosehip seed oil then my daily cream. I have been using the vit c serum for a while. This seems to enhance it!! My skin is.just plumped up dewy and looking better than ever. This bottle will also last a while as a few drops goes a long way. As for my acne bye bye! What an amazing oil.</li>
    <li> I love this large bottle of Rosehip Oil. You can tell it is high quality and it has so many uses. I use it for my son&#x27;s Eczema and my rough skin on my arms and it works great. But Rosehip Oil has many uses. If you read other reviews people use it for dandruff and all sorts of things. I love using oils because I know they work. You get a good size bottle at a good price. I recommend this to anyone with dry skin or Eczema or a flakey scalp.</li>
    <li> Very good oil for dry skin. It aggravated my acne but this is sometimes expected with Rosehip oil, just avoid using it on your T Zone.</li>
    <li> This is a large 4 oz bottle of GoPure Natural’s Rosehip Oil. I first had a doubt about this oil because it was rather cheap for a 4 oz bottle. After testing the oil myself, I realized that this is not pure rosehip oil. Genuine rosehip oil would have a golden amber color. GoPure’s rosehip oil look like vegetable oil. No offense but it even smell like vegetable oil and nowhere near rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands of rosehip oil and this is one of the most diluted one I have came across.&lt;br /&gt;It has comes to my attention that the seller has mass down voted my review so that people don&#x27;t read or pay attention to this review.&lt;br /&gt;People NEED to examine what they are buying!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of this oil is very light. A transparent yellow.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nothing like rosehip, It smells bland and very similar to the cooking oil at home.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is wrong as well. Very oily like cooking oil. Greasy. Rosehip should be a very gentle oil and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see photo 2 and 3. I have circled the goPure Naturals rosehip oil in red. The oil in the black circle is a genuine rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;After experimenting with this oil. I believe this oil is heavily diluted/ adultered or contain little of the real rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The bottle claims that the oil is certified organic 100% pure and natural but there is no label proving such claim. Also it does not say certified organic &amp;#34;rosehip oil&amp;#34;. Therefore I do not believe this is genuine 100% pure rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received a reduced price for the oil for testing/reviewing purposes. All of my reviews are 100% honest and from my own experience. I do not promise a good rating. I am not affiliated with this company nor compensated in any way. Thank you for reading and I hope this review will help you in your purchase.</li>
    <li> A great product.  I started using it instead of baby oil to remove eye makeup and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
    <li> I use Rosehip Oil in a myriad of ways because it is good not just for my skin but for my scalp and hair as well. I use it to moisturize my body, protect my scalp from dryness and dandruff and on my face as well. I normally mix it with organic essential oils that are safe to use and beneficial to the skin. I also add it to my &amp;#34;home made lotion&amp;#34; mix (fractionated coconut oil, organic raw shea butter, essential oils) and I must say that my sensitive and perpetually dry diabetic skin has been loving it! It&#x27;s an organic product - which is a big plus for me. You really get the most bang for your buck with this product, as you&#x27;re purchasing a big bottle of the product for a reasonable price. Truly worth checking out and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

    <li> Definitely will buy this again</li>
    <li> Appsolutly LOVE this use it for many many things and has had amazing results for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> This is not high quality Rosehip oil.  I have been using Rosehip oil for awhile now and I decided to try out a different brand.  I am shocked that they are able to even market this as Rosehip Oil, it is extremely low quality, if it actually is really authentic.&lt;br /&gt;After the first application, I was able to tell this stuff was not the real thing.  It did not absorb into the skin and was extremely greasy. It did absolutely nothing for my skin, in fact my skin became dehydrated from using this product for only a few days. Don&#x27;t waste you money.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to Life-Flo Organic Pure Rosehip Seed Oil, 1 Ounce, it is the real deal and gives you amazing hydrated glowing skin.</li>
    <li> Great quality and large quantity.  Happy with my order of Rosehip Oil.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I can truly attest to its moisturizing properties. My skin feels so soft and so far no clogged pores. I truly recommend this product if you are suffering with dry skin. I&#x27;m confident you want be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lots of product for the money.  I use it at night over serum and sometimes no other cream.  Has not caused any problem with my skin and my skin feels more moisturized!</li>
    <li> Just getting started in learning more about essential oils, this one seems to be a good quality for the price, again I&#x27;m not expert but for what I know you can get a very good deal with this bottle</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil on my hair, mainly.  I have long curly/frizzy hair that needs moisture. This has been great at keeping my hair smooth. I&#x27;m so happy that it comes in a 4oz bottle because I use this daily, after I shampoo, condition, and towel dry, I put about 8-10 drops in my palm and rub it into the ends of my hair. Then, I put a couple more drops in my palms, and put my mousse on top of it, and put it in my hair. I do not put it on the crown of my hair because I think it would weigh it dow,n due to the length and weight of my hair. If i had shorter hair I would probably use it with the mousse there as well.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my legs after I shave, it gives me a nice shiny glow, and absorbs really well.&lt;br /&gt;This has so many uses that I haven&#x27;t even tried yet. I plan on using it on my cuticles to see if it will help with my hangnail situation. I have a feeling that it is going to work well for that because from just using it on my hair and legs, I can tell a diffference in them. So, that is next on my list.&lt;br /&gt;It is 100% natural and has a Money Back Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as a great addition to your beauty and skin care arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a sample of this product to evaluate and give my honest and unbiased opinion. No other compensatin was provided.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now &amp; can already see improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> fast deliver and LOVE the product it is great</li>
    <li> Unsure yet of the therapeutic effects but it feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! My skin looks and feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> A very nice quality rose oil. The brand I had used previously had a slightly unpleasant door to it. This one is more neutral. I also use a lot less - a drop, really - on my face in the morning. My skin really likes rose oil!</li>
    <li> Good for hair, skin, nails...everything!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!. I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things! This one is clearly a hit and I will be purchasing again another for my daughter! I have already seen a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> Was weary, but thought I&#x27;d try it. So glad I did. My skin feels so soft and smooth. No real smell, which I&#x27;m very glad about!  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> It feels nice on my skin. I haven&#x27;t been using it very long but there isn&#x27;t a strong smell to it and it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this Rosehip Oil. I&#x27;ve used other Rosehip Oils on and off over the years, as part of my skin care regime, and have always had good results with this type of oil. This Rosehip Oil is just lovely, and is especially special because it&#x27;s organic and cold pressed - two important matters to me, that are not so easy to find in a Rosehip Oil. I&#x27;m happy to have quality Rosehip Oil back in my beauty regime again. I usually apply it in the evenings after dinner (a few hours before bed), to allow the oil to be fully absorbed before I place my face on a pillow, or one can just lightly dab their face with a tissue to get any excess oil off before bedtime. Even though it comes in a tinted glass bottle, I store this oil in a cool dark cabinet to further preserve it&#x27;s raw delicate qualities. I purchased this product as a promotional sample in return for an honest and objective review.</li>
    <li> Great oil! Doesn&#x27;t leave face feeling greasy. Great to use before my moisturizer or night cream.</li>
    <li> I use this rosehip oil in replace of my moisturizer because I feel like it really gives my skin a lot of moisture. I have oily skin and at first I was nerves this oil will make my skin more oily but it didn&#x27;t do that. Once it was fully absorbed into my skin there wasn&#x27;t a sticky or greasy feeling on my face. I read on the bottle that it helps with stretch marks so I have been putting it on my stretch marks and so far nothing but it does take awhile. I put this rosehip oil on my back to help with acne because a friend told me rosehip oil is suppose to help with acne. My acne seems to be less red than it was before using this rosehip oil. My scalp is dry with flakes and I put a few drops of this rosehip oil in my scalp 10 minutes before showering. I have notice my scalp being less itchy and having less flakes. I got this 100% rosehip free to review to give my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. i have used it in my mixtures to keep my hair healthy by mixing it with coconut oils, tea tree,lavender, and peppermint oils. i have also used this product to hydrate my hands and feet, which are usually pretty rough but after trying this product for almost 2 weeks, i have noticed that my feet are less dry, they look more healthy and even my nails are starting to look more healthy. i have also used this in my DIY mixture of argan oil and coconut oil to keep my eyelashes healthy and to grow them out. And yes i have noticed a huge difference in my eyelash length since adding this to my mixtures. its very gentle so that if any accidentally gets into my eye, it does not irritate it at all….instead it just leave me with blurry eyes for the next hour..but that’s entirely my fault for not watching how much i use, so its nice that this product is so forgiving when i decide to be reckless and YOLO this stuff onto my eyelashes every few hours..every day…</li>
    <li> I have heard about the benefits of Rosehip oil for both face and body for quite some time, especially from my friends in Spain. I did some research before deciding on this product, and I am not disappointed in the least. I have been using this daily in lieu of my facial serum, and my skin is glowing. My family has asked me what I&#x27;ve been using, because even without makeup on, my skin looks good! I&#x27;ve recently started using it on my body after showering, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with those results as well. A little goes a long way!  I will definitely be buying this item again, many thanks!</li>
    <li> I have started using the oil from past 6 days. So far no result, I bought this based on the reviews. After few weeks I will update with exact review</li>
    <li> A beautiful oil for a magnificent price! The quality &amp; integrity of the company is 1st class. Love it!!</li>
    <li> great product, i have been putting in in my hair after I wash it to keep the tips fresh and healthy, lightweight, not too strong of a smell.  also great for many uses not just hair.</li>
    <li> Planning to use it for soap making for my mom. Came in a glass bottle with a glass dropper in a bubble wrap bag l Iol.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil for a lot of different things. It has little scent, and works great as a carrier oil. I have used it for chapstick and heel balm so far, and I&#x27;m happy with the results. Great product!</li>
    <li> This oil works great for my face. I leave it on at night and wake up with very soft supple skin. It is not oily once you apply to your skin. I also put a few drops in my favorite body lotion. I recommend it....</li>
    <li> Excellent Moisturizer. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I love natural oils for moisturizing, reducing acne, scars, etc. Rosehip oil is a great product for that, and the free dropper makes it super easy to use. I love that the bottle is large enough that you get quite a bit, but small enough that I can take with me on trips if I want to. The oil is super moisturizing, works great on it&#x27;s own or with essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
    <li> i really like this product for my itchy skin and i like that a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help with my dermatitis, scars and hair. So far, my skin is softer and less irritated. Time will tell with the scars. My hair is softer and more manageable. Thanks.</li>
    <li> wonderful product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice....leaves skin soft, not oily.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;m extremely picky about the oils I use and this one hit 5 stars all around. The packaging was nice, and the glass dropper doesn&#x27;t give too much or too little flow. There was no leaks during shipment, and it was refreshing that the seller was conscious about making sure the product made it safely to my doorstep. I can&#x27;t stress enough how competitive the pricing is for organic oils. The product leaves my skin feeling very smooth, the only thing comparable is my Vitamin E oil, but this is also much less greasy with the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t attest to how this works on stretch marks because I was lucky enough not to have any, even after children. However, this product does make an excellent homemade massage oil. It&#x27;s worth it just for that. I also have chronically dry skin and eczema, not only does this product not irritate my skin but it seems to help with issues that the seller doesn&#x27;t boast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent does not overpower at all, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals, to which I have a very sensitive nose. This product does not disappoint at any turn, it&#x27;s well worth the price-tag, and going into my regular skin regimen. Thank you goPURE naturals, for bringing such an excellent product to the market.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, leaves my skin soft and it smells nice</li>
    <li> As of now I love this oil.  I bought it because it had such good reviews.  It absorbs very fast and without leaving an oily residue on your skin.  I am using this oil for some stretch marks that I have on my hips.  I have only used it for a few days, so I cannot say if it is working or not, but I trust that it will in the long run!  I would recommend this product, just because it is so much better to get things that are natural and put that on your body then all the chemicals that we daily intake in many forms into our bodies.  Oil of any kind is good for your skin.  I have very oily skin as is, but because I work in an office, and handle a lot of paper, my skin dries out pretty fast.  Go ahead and buy it.  It will last you a long while with 4 ounces of oil, plus a dropper to help you place a small amount of oil on your palm.  I would not use more than the size of a quarter.  Plus if you like essential oils, this is a great carrier oil as well.</li>
    <li> Natural and organic, ths has to be great for skin.  Great moisturizer!  Will need to stick with it a longer time to see results.</li>
    <li> I never found such a big bottle, much less @ that price. Love it!</li>
    <li> When I read reviews talking about the smell of this oil, it makes me wonder if I got a bad batch.  The oil I got is nearly odorless and is a very light, translucent yellow.  It&#x27;s not a deep amber like some reviews suggest.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for around 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin good or bad.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, the smell of rose hip oil isn&#x27;t fantastic.  I&#x27;ve tried a myriad of brands and they all smell the same/similar, so I know it has nothing to do with brand.  With that being said, I love this product and I love the way rose hip oil works on my face.  It absorbs quickly and easily and the smell is gone almost the minute you put it on your face.</li>
    <li> I love rosehip oil.I use another brand religiously. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this particular rosehip oil just doesn&#x27;t work well with my facial skin. I broke out and never do when using RHO. I do break out when using other oils on my face such as sweet almond oil..grapeseed oil..even jojoba oil..This particular oil doesn&#x27;t have the scent that traditional RHO has and is not dark in color like other brands are.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it serves my purposes very well. It,mixes with my others oils very nicely.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful addition to my essential oil collection. So many of my recipes call for it. The quality is excellent and there was no leakage during shipping!</li>
    <li> I purchased the goPURE Naturals Rosehip Oil about 3 weeks ago and have added it to my daily skincare regimen.  I love the fact that I can apply it to my face and neck, wait a few minutes and then apply my moisturizer, a little make up and I&#x27;m out the door.  It absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy!  It is also such a great value that I find I&#x27;m using it on my arms and legs on a daily basis.  I will definitely be keeping this as part of my anti-aging arsenal!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I put it in my face before my make up and my skin looks so smooth. I get complements on how my make up looks all the time!  I also have super dry skin and this is wonderful for that. Best stuff I have bought in a long time!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 1 week.  So far I like it and it seems to calm my rosacea.  I&#x27;m using this instead of moisturizers.  I like it better and it makes my face softer.  So many lotions seem to wear off after a few hours and my face gets dry again but the rose oil lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I add a few drops (1-2) of this to my moisturizer morning &amp; evening and love the extra oomph it seems to give my skin. My skin is mature + sensitive, and have had no issues using this 2x a day.</li>
    <li> My skin has never been so soft!  The bottle is HUGE, especially for the price. Every other essential oil I have purchased has been in a 5-15mL (1-3tsp), this is 4 oz!  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It soaks in easily and quickly and does not leave oily residue to stain clothes.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Using on face as a moisturizer.  Very pleased and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use this rosehip oil as a a facial moisturizer and as a nightly treatment on my stretch marks. So far (in two weeks of use) I really like how it feels on my skin. I can&#x27;t say I have seen any immediate results but I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate, so this is a nice addition to my skin regimen.  Really hydrates the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I use it on my face with jojoba oil in the a.m. Oil cleansing style.</li>
    <li> Oh how much I love my rose hip oil &amp;#60;3</li>
</ol>
