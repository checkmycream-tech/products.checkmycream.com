<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The hold and fragrance are excellent.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product several times.  I like the Moroccan scent.  However, it does not have much holding power!</li>
    <li> Light hold and nice fragrance</li>
    <li> This hairspray smells good - which i really like - but the hold isn&#x27;t very strong so I probably wont buy it again</li>
    <li> I love and use the Moroccan oil every time I wash my hair, so after having read the reviews, I was excited to try this hair spray.  What a disappointment.  This doesn&#x27;t smell nice at all- just like your average cheap-o stuff.  Also, it does gunk up enough that I have to use a deep-cleansing shampoo to remove it.  That kills it for me.  Sorry I dropped such a chunk of change on something I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
    <li> Great, healthy for your hair hairspray.</li>
    <li> Beautifully smelling hairspray.</li>
    <li> Works really well on curly hair</li>
    <li> Holds nicely without dragging hair down.  Also does not get sticky after several days use. It really smells good too</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray and the price and availability but......mine came with the cap broken to bits. Bummer!</li>
    <li> This hairspray has a light-medium hold and the finish keeps my hair from looking stiff. I like the smell, however someone that&#x27;s sensitive to scents probably wouldn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Did not really need a spray. I LOVE all of Morroccan oil products. Just not much for sprays</li>
    <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as I thought it would. I&#x27;ll use a different product next time....</li>
    <li> Great product ! Will buy again ! Thanks !</li>
    <li> All Moroccan Oil products are great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really get the rave of Moroccan oil.  I find coconut oil conditions hair SO much better and you only need a pea size dab.  As for this hair spray I didn&#x27;t find it held my hair for more than an hour really.  At best.  IF you stray too much, hoping for some kind of hold, then you get a greasy look. It was a good idea in theory but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> The spray is nice and light, and is very fresh smelling.  Because my hair is very fine, I use it to style.  I wish the hold was a little stronger, as it doesn&#x27;t keep my style for the day.</li>
    <li> I will never change from this brand. This was my first time ordering the strong hold vs. medium.  I like it a lot!! And it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Love Moroccanoil, and the price was fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> It holds the style without making the hair stiff.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair and this isn&#x27;t the best &amp;#34;holding&amp;#34; hairspray for my hair but I love the smell and it keeps my fly aways down!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Delivered as stated!</li>
    <li> Very light weight, smells nice. Seems to have a good hold. I use it on my girls too. Will Recommend</li>
    <li> I love the smell and you can&#x27;t tell that there&#x27;s hairspray in your hair.  Yes, you can brush it out, but your hair may feel a bit dry.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product but arrived with dents in the can!</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan Oil products! I use the shampoo, conditioner, root boost, mask, hair spray, heat spray, and oil. I like to layer the products to extend the scent. This product smells great and does not weigh down  my fine hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing - it smells incredible. There&#x27;s no sticky build-up, which is a good thing because you have to use a lot of this product to hold your style. I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the pricetag.</li>
    <li> Does not provide a good hold.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and recommend it to everyone. Thanks for the efficiency and honesty. Buy more time with you</li>
    <li> Smells just like the treatment...amazing! Makes my hair so shiny and holds without making my hair crunchy or hard. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Good light hold. I have to keep another firmer spray for my bangs but this is a terrific spray for a light hold that is never stiff.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive for hairspray, but worth every penny!  It keeps your hair in place without being heavy and sticky.  And the smell is great, which is a big plus!</li>
    <li> Have fine hair.  Not as good as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this product, have used for about three years now. Will not change.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has a very distinct odor to it. It also doesn&#x27;t hold my hair well and leaves a residue. I will finish the can but won&#x27;t repurchase it</li>
    <li> I have a very fine, limp hair. When I use this hair spray my hair has body and the style stays in place even when I wake up in the morning, without appearing stiff.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray!  And it smells sooo good! I use this throughout the day because it is not sticky, yet it does hold. Great spray!</li>
    <li> Great product and was delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> NOT the same product as sold in salons.  The smell and texture is different than the one I purchased from a salon.  This one has some foreign language written on it which seems to indicate that it is a fake product.</li>
    <li> This hairspray holds wonderfully without any stickness.  I have was introduced to this product at a salon and have used this product for years.  Love this product</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair bouncy and soft-can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccanoil Hairspray.  It has a strong hold yet it is never stiff or sticky and leaves your hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. I don&#x27;t think this is a strong hold, however I still recommend it.</li>
    <li> I keep trying other less expensive hairsprays but always come back to Moroccanoil hairspray.  It is simply the best if you want a style that holds and a great scent.  It will make your hair a bit stiff but if holding a curl is what you want, look no further.</li>
    <li> expensive for a hairspray but it works well for my hairstyle</li>
    <li> I cannot understand how people say it has a nice scent. I sprayed my hair and could not stand the smell. It lasted for hours. I had to wash it out quickly. Threw it out!</li>
    <li> Excellent hairspsray by Moroccanoil.  I used to use Sebastian for years but now love this hairspray.  It is much lighter and the hold is excellent.</li>
    <li> Great price, all good</li>
    <li> this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to work the same as the version I bought in the salon. I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s counterfeit so instead of 1 star I&#x27;ll give them 3 but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same or seem to hold the same. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Soft hold great smell.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It works pretty well but it only makes it hold a little longer</li>
    <li> Luv luv this hair spray but this last can I purchased is not spraying. Also, the shipping charges were high, I thought. I will just purchase in a salon next time.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray ever!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a light hair spray, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good hold, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> The strong hold is not stiff, heavy or sticky.  Has a nice fragrance.  You can redo your do and get a lovely result.  No more expensive than the typical hairsprays in retail stores.</li>
    <li> Ordered first can on amazon, holds without stiffness, smells good too.Fine mist finishing spray with morroccon isy number one hair must have.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite hairspray.  I can&#x27;t believe how light it feels on my hair but yet it holds wonderfully and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> My problem I do not like this long lasting, to me cheep smell to this line, also noticed sticky on my naturally curly, freeze prune, dry hair in dry Colorado climate,  of cause not worse spent money for me, I may try it humid climates, may be it will work? I think would never buy it again. Do not buy all different products of same line, just try one if you like the smell, unless you are not sensitive to smells, my favorite perfumes are almost all Sisley parfumes, currently# 3, if you are similar, this review may be helpful.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> My hair usually don&#x27;t hold a spray, but until tried this brand.  Wow just a little spray goes along way, &amp; also holds my style most of the day!</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil Hairspray holds well without weighing down my fine hair, but does not feel &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; either; wonderful scent.  My favorite hairspray.</li>
    <li> This product is great - does not dull hair, gives it a gloss (low level) and holds it really good.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used hairspray in decades but this one I use to add volume.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the only one I buy over and over again! A little pricier than others, but works great. Natural look and fabulous scent. Best price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> i love this hair spray ,, but i can get it cheaper through my hair dresser</li>
    <li> Satisfied.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Very fine mist, perfect hold, even in humidity. And wonderful fragrance!</li>
    <li> I basically buy it for the good smell, but it works well too.  A bit pricey.</li>
    <li> This hairspray &amp;#34;holds&amp;#34; while still feeling light, and it smells wonderful.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Holds hair really nicely.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccanoil!  Best hairspray I have ever used!!  It arrived in great condition and I am buying more right now!  Excellent!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not provide a very strong hold.  In fact, after spraying, I could not even tell anything had been sprayed on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this hairspray before and loved it but this is the first time I bought it via amazon and something is off. It does not feel, act, or smell like the previous product (I bought at a local retailer). I am not sure if this product was not genuine or if it was old, but it is not the same. After four uses I threw it away, such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Seems to make my fine hair feel dirty. If i spray lightly it doesn&#x27;t hold well. All my friends use it and love it..just not for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair spray for over 4 years. Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair, has a nice scent and isn&#x27;t stiff.</li>
    <li> Buy this hair spray at the request of my mom and I liked it so much that now I&#x27;ll buy it for my personal use.</li>
    <li> This is hairspray is amazing. Great hold without the sticky or crispy feel. Leaves hair in place without the plastered look.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a firm hold, this is not the product you want.  But, if you&#x27;re looking for a hairspray that will help shape your hair while you&#x27;re styling it and that keeps the style/curl in without being stiff, you can&#x27;t find better...  Or, at least, I haven&#x27;t.  We live in a humid part of the country and this never never gets sticky.  You can always run your fingers through your hair. It smells very nice, too.</li>
    <li> Love love love this hairspray.  This is the strong hold which I definitely recommend.  The medium hold just doesn&#x27;t give that much hold.  The smell is wonderful as always.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Curls held well into the night</li>
    <li> Works amazing!!  Doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and fragrance is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I received the product in a timely manner and I really like this hairspray.  It gives a soft hold so you hair is still soft to the touch after using it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE all my Moraccanoil Hair Products.  The Hairspray was a disappointment.  It does not hold my style in place.  It is not strong enough and after a few hours my hair is flat and the style is gone.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite every day hairspray.  It smells great and is very lightweight.  I have straight fine hair and prefer natural hair as opposed to over styled or crispy hair.  This isn&#x27;t my choice for very humid days, but my go-to on most days and for work.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The produc was as advertised and was received in reasonable time.  Hairspray appears legitmate.</li>
    <li> Smells good but flipped hair out on the ends</li>
    <li> awesome product. superfast delivery. great packaging</li>
    <li> Gives a nice shine to your hair without the stiffness</li>
    <li> Love the product...holds my heavy hair &amp; smells fabulous</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it made my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Used this for years, still do, always will.  What can I say? It works!  Nice subtle hold &amp; gentle scent.</li>
    <li> Love the smelll of Moroccanoil products.  Holds nicely.</li>
    <li> This well and doesn&#x27;t make your hair too stiff or shiny. My only issue is that while I like the scent, it gives me headaches (but I&#x27;m sensitive to most scents, unfortunately). If the smell were milder, I&#x27;d be able to give it a 5-star rating. Great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t now I still useed</li>
    <li> Too heavy for fine hair, but smells amazing</li>
    <li> Love it.  Can&#x27;t use anything else.  Also smells amazing</li>
    <li> What captures your attention at first is the wonderful scent......but then you realize that the biggest plus is the wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair and is now thinning as I am 66yrs old.  This will hold your fine hair with a shine and not a bit of the cement hair look that often occurs with fine hair.  you can comb it out and redo your hair style and it will look clean and neat.  I have used it for 10 months now and although it might be a little more costly, I find that it lasts a lot longer than the average can of hair spray.  well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is strong but light and has a refreshing smell. It holds for long periods of time without reapplying.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite sprays to use during the styling stage.</li>
    <li> I like it otherwise I would not have bought it</li>
    <li> I had used the Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray, Medium Hold and found that it just did not hold well enough. This product is perfect! It does have a strong hold without being stiff or gunky. It smells wonderful, works well and is a keeper!</li>
    <li> One of the best harsprays I have ever used. Not hard or sticky. I would reccommend it to anyone with fine hair that needs spray to hold without feeling like a rock.</li>
    <li> Eh, makes my hair dry, coated and adds to static.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is the best!</li>
    <li> This is the only product use..</li>
    <li> I bought my last bottle of pray from a salon.... and it worked great!!! This product does not even hold my hair!!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!</li>
    <li> Learned about his product from a local hairdresser.  It holds very well without being too stiff and it also adds a little sheen to your hair, which I find very becoming.  I&#x27;ve tried using a firm hold hairspray and then a \\&quot;shine\\&quot; spray, but usually that just \\&quot;melts\\&quot; the spray and leaves my hair a little greasier than I&#x27;d like.  This product brushes out easily and doesn&#x27;t keep your hair \\&quot;matted\\&quot; to your head.  My hair&#x27;s very thick and heavy and can stand up to most any product and this one carries the style through the entire day.  Plus it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Great transaction!! Super fast shipping and fair price for a great product!! I would purchase this product again! I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other products made by this brand.</li>
    <li> Not a strong hold. Fragrance not as pleasing as other products.  Wish it really did hold and smell as nice as the other products.</li>
    <li> Product is great BUT I will not buy anymore because the shipping charges are to high and makes it easier and cheaper to but at a retail store.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great andh as great hold. It even worked on my hair when i was in Jamaica with the humiditiy.</li>
    <li> Fabulous smell and more amazing soft, long hold. No other hairspray shall be good enough any more!</li>
    <li> This product performs as advertised. I live in a small town the tropics, and I only saw this product advertised on Amazon.com. This product holds up.</li>
    <li> Love all moroccanoil products! They smell so good and def do the job</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and the product is great</li>
    <li> always good. have used it for past year or so. not sticky, smells great and keeps&lt;br /&gt;my hair from frizzing</li>
    <li> It is ok but as good as exsepted.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair spray gives my hair a lot of shine !!!!</li>
    <li> The perfect hairspray! love It.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It makes my hair smell amazing!</li>
    <li> This hairspray is light, but definitely gets the job done!  Can hardly believe how well it holds my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I was disappointment with this product.  Do not like the scent that it leaves nor the the texture of my hair  after I spray it on.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Holds my hair very well without making it stiff.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve purchased this hairspray before from another seller (no longer available) and it was great, but when i bought it from UltrabeautyDaySpa, it smelled the same but felt much different and did not hold my hair well at all like the old bottle did.  also gave my (temporary) waves a greasy look. both were called &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; hold but the bad bottle had the &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; at the top of the bottle and and the good one had it halfway down.  terrible, i want the old stuff back!</li>
    <li> It is a light, good smelling hairspray that holds well.  It is not sticky like most hair  sprays.  You don&#x27;t&#x27; even know you have put it on.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this on my hair and I loved the smell...I had to get it!  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and I&#x27;ve got to say, it isn&#x27;t the strongest hairspray.  I don&#x27;t personally think it holds as well as some others too.  But, it smells good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big hairspray user, but when I do, I always use Dos Equis!  KIDDING!  For the rare times that I do use hairspray, I will reach for this one because it smells really good, no typical hairspray smell at all, and it actually holds hairstyles very well without making hair crispy.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I think it&#x27;s worth spending that much for something that works well!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. It smells great and it does it&#x27;s job. I used to use Sebastian products and since the Morroccan line came out, that&#x27;s all I use now.</li>
    <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, but I&#x27;m not throwing it out, either.  I switched from Rave because it put white flakes in my hair and made it stiff and unmanageable.  Overall, this product smells very nice, but speaking as a person with a lot of heavy, wavy hair, it doesn&#x27;t last any longer than something you could buy at a grocery store.</li>
    <li> Best smelling hairspray ever!</li>
    <li> Great product, timely service, and reasonable price!</li>
    <li> This hairspray is excellent! I just love it. It is holds well but you can brush through your hair after it is sprayed on,</li>
    <li> This hair spray is the bomb.  It&#x27;s expensive but it really is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  It holds but seems to do better with my hair and condition it somewhat.  And it comes out of your hair easier.</li>
    <li> Makes hair stiff and not manageable. Dislike not would recommend. Makes hair very stiff and unmanageable. Didn&#x27;t even finish the can.</li>
    <li> The price is good. I used it on straight hair and I found that it worked better compared to when I used it on my curly hair do. I found that after a little while my curls fell out. Nice that it doesn&#x27;t leave hair crunchy though. Also, Great delivery time!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  It is not very strong, however, so if you are looking for a real holding spray, this isn&#x27;t it.  What&#x27;s great about this hairspray:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells GREAT!  People are constantly asking me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing when I&#x27;m not wearing any - it&#x27;s always the hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is fabulous for spraying and giving light hold, but still leaving your hair feeling really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to help style my hair just after I&#x27;ve blown it dry.  It gives some light hold and helps style, while smelling great.  At night it is really easy to brush out, so the next day there is no heavy feeling where your hair gets tangled if you try to brush it.  My hair is always flexible and soft, yet it has a light hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is slightly expensive but I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It has just enough hold without being stiff or sticky, plus it smells great!  The seller was awesome as well;  my first bottle arrived and the nozzle stopped working after the first use.  I emailed them asking to exchange and they got right back to me saying they would ship me another bottle at no cost at to keep the bottle I had.  The new bottle arrived two days later.  Extremely happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Another awesome product by Moroccan oil. I&#x27;ve tried all types of hairs sprays from Sebastian, Alterna, and my more. I am willing to pay money for good products. Well, this hair spray smells good an holds well all day. My daughter tried it, and wanted her own. I  also bought her the hair spray. Great hair spray!</li>
    <li> Good price and quality.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairspray for a while and am very happy with the results.  Roulala 18 had the best price and delivery was very prompt.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Seen this in magazines and celebs use - great smell on your hair too!</li>
    <li> This was the first time I tried this product. I love it. It does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky nor does it produce any flakes. I have curly hair so I don&#x27;t wash it everyday. This can be used the next day and your hair still looks as great as&lt;br /&gt;the day before. The light scent is also nice.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has a very nice fragrance and leaves hair soft yet under control.  Like all Moroccanoil products, worth the rather hefty price tag</li>
    <li> I discovered this hairspray at my hair salon and never changed to any other product. It leaves your hair held in place without stiffness. It does not build up and soil the hair with regular use.</li>
    <li> Never using another hairspray again! This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair looks better than it ever has now and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product works like I want it to. Was trying different products but never found what really works for my hair.</li>
    <li> Good product, but don&amp;#34;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Love it and the price here makes it even better</li>
    <li> I really love this spray. I was looking for hair spray that would give my graying hair some shine without it looking stiff or making my thinning hair brittle. While it doesn&#x27;t hold the style, it does leave a beautiful, healthy-looking shine. Nice scent, too. I use my reg. spray for the hold, then a light spray of this on top. Perfect. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I Love it! It holds great. Smells good. First time user and will continue to use this product and brand.</li>
    <li> Smells great and good hold</li>
    <li> I really like this brand, but this hairspray leaves your hair feeling heavy and dirty. It&#x27;s not stiff, but it&#x27;s weighty. I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This is really good! It leaves my hair luminous, I&#x27;m loving it!!</li>
    <li> I like this hairspray a lot.  Unfortunately, I just can&#x27;t get used to the smell.  It&#x27;s very musky, which isn&#x27;t something I like.  If it weren&#x27;t for that, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
    <li> Perfect hold, scent - I&#x27;m ready in minutes with this making me all set to go!</li>
    <li> Great hair spray even for a man , awesome hold and yet light</li>
    <li> I have short, very fine, thin, curly hair. This hair spray helps to give my hair lots of body.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray it has the perfect amount of hold without leaving your hair crunchy and stiff</li>
    <li> Good hairspray but it has a very, very strong scent. No need to wear perfume, this hairspray&#x27;s scent will last all day and is not a good scent at all, it&#x27;s powdery, sweet, kind of old-ish smelling fragrance. My great-grandmother would&#x27;ve love it but I can&#x27;t stand it. I didn&#x27;t pay lots of money for perfume to smell like a grandma all day because or hairspray.</li>
    <li> Product was just as expected.  Quality met my expectations and shipping was prompt.  Makes the wife happy at Christmas.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this line of products</li>
    <li> Love this has an awesome smell and great flexible hold</li>
    <li> Came quickly and exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mother.  She loves the hold yet it looks as though she&#x27;s not wearing any hairspray at all.  She can brush thru it with no stickiness.  Great product.  My only complaint was in delivery, the can had a dent in it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a flexible hold, but does a good job keeping curly hair from frizzing without looking stiff.  Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Smells great and holds well while being flexible</li>
    <li> This is the greatest hairspray,it  smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave crusty residue. I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day and you can use it over and over without hair being gross</li>
    <li> It is a great hairspray with a soft hold and a mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> It does not make your hair stiff and sticky!! Holds your hair in place--bonus it smells wonderful too! A little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> After purchasing Moroccanoil products for myself, I loved it so much that I now make gift baskets with them for my friends and family.  This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Perfect for using on a finished hair style.</li>
    <li> While I love the scent of this spray and lightness, it doesn&#x27;t hold my curls that great and it makes my scalp itch - but I do have sensitive skin. I guess I expected more with all the raves.</li>
    <li> I bought the morrocan oil hairspray as I already have the oil that I use to keep my hair in tip top shape.  It holds my hair in place after styling.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and a little goes a long way. Keeps hair in place so spray when you are truly ready for it, if lightly sprayed will not flake.</li>
    <li> Most hair sprays on my hair are either too thick, or when you spray it&#x27;s so forceful it blows your hair out of form. Then it&#x27;s like plaster and you can&#x27;t fix or fuss with your hair to get your hair right.  This spray is a lighter mist type that will allow you to fuss with your hair after a spray.  Also next day, your hair does not feel full of product or matted to your head from sleep.  I bought this product local to me, but found on Amazon $7.00 cheaper.</li>
    <li> Loving this hairspray. Fresh and works.</li>
    <li> This was my first hairspray by Moroccanoil, but I LOVE their products and especially the smell.  This scent is still amazing, however the hold is a little too stiff for me, I prefer a more flexible hold rather than extra strong.  I thought it was a more natural hold but it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is pricey but lasts ( for me) a long time. The smell is really fresh. The hold is not very firm so your hair is not left stiff.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I had been using  John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease Moisture Barrier Firm Hold Hairspray daily for a long time. It held like a rock, but as I wash my hair only twice a week, it really built up a lot of flakes and fuzz in between washings. I had used a few other Moroccan oil products and liked them, so I decided to try the hairspray. The scent, of course, is great. I use hot rollers to give my hair lift on top and soft curls on the ends. This spray holds the style lightly, without any stiffness or build up. I can use it day after day and my hair remains soft. It holds the curls pretty well, very naturally. Of course in very breezy conditions it goes everywhere, but seems easier to put back in place, where the stiffer Frizz Ease seemed to hold the hair in whatever position the wind blew it into. I like this product very much and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair too stiff. It holds it, but is more flexible.</li>
    <li> Best smell, use for a light hold.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this. I just feel like it leaves hair super stiff and then frizzes if you brush it out. The oil is great!</li>
    <li> I love this product and will order it again. Great smell, does not gunk up hair and has a medium flexible hold.</li>
    <li> LOVE the entire Moroccanoil line!</li>
    <li> Authentic and smells great</li>
    <li> I buy this mostly due to the smell, love it. It has ok hold, flexible. If your looking for strong hold, like the old aqua net this is not it.</li>
