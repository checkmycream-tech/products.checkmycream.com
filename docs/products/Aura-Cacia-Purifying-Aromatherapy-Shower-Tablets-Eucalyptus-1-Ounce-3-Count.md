      <li>These are great for opening my sinuses w/o adding more pills to my already large quantity of meds</li>
      <li>These smell better in the box and does not work in the shower.  </li>
      <li>: I will not be purchasing these again, I will be searching for another brand as I was not fully satisfied with the Aura Cacia Shower Tablets.</li>
      <li>These were alot better than the Level tablets.</li>
      <li>I love using these shower tabs.  </li>
      <li>The smell is not what I would call eucalyptus but more of a cleaning product.</li>
      <li>I love them.  </li>
      <li>REALLY ENJOYED IT</li>
      <li>stock up on more.</li>
      <li>A nice hot shower with one of these in it decongests you and wakes you up so you can face the day, they are a staple in our house for sure!</li>
      <li>Good as the real Shower Soothers?</li>
      <li>I bought this item looking for a substitute for no longer available Sudacare tablets.</li>
      <li>These shower tablets smell great and they take a long time to dissolve but the smell fades really quickly.</li>
      <li>The scent was strong when first in contact with water then nothing.</li>
      <li>Thought this item would be great for colds.. like other product,(sudacare)</li>
      <li>The tablet dissolves quickly:  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to find this product in any of our local stores, so I was glad to find it on line.  </li>
      <li>It is released really quickly and towards the end of your shower, even if the tablet hasn&#x27;t fully dissolved yet, the smell fades away.</li>
      <li>But they still do not have the stronger vapors that the old Sudacare, ones had sure</li>
      <li>Will pay more next time for another product that emanates the odor</li>
      <li>I followed instructions exactly, and you could not tell it was even in the shower.</li>
      <li>Hot, steamy shower and Aura Cacia Eucalyptus tabs.</li>
      <li>AND IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try a home made remedy first.</li>
      <li>These are the best for those mornings you have a cold and really don&#x27;t want to get ready for work.</li>
      <li>but the cost was not that much....</li>
      <li>Not as much scent as I wanted...</li>
      <li>Not worth the money, save it and go for a better product.  </li>
      <li>So if they would last longer I would have given them a higher rating.  </li>
      <li>I even end up having to then put it under the direct shower so it will disintegrate.</li>
      <li>Definitely didn&#x27;t release as much menthol or eucalyptus as Shower Soothers used to.  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t come near to it.  </li>
      <li>I believe the directions say to place under direct water</li>
      <li>It lasted around 4 minutes in the shower without it being in the direct flow of water.</li>
      <li>terrible-I should&#x27;ve just bought a bottle which would&#x27;ve been much stronger and given 10 times the use for the same price</li>
      <li>so the water did not stream directly onto it.</li>
      <li>Scent is barely recognizable, and does not last long.  </li>
      <li>Could barely smell it in the shower.</li>
      <li>The scent lasts barely a minute.  </li>
      <li>Used one of these for the first time yesterday.. Couldn&#x27;t even smell the Eucalyptus unless I was bending down.  </li>
      <li>Great product for a head cold or headache to steam yourself in the shower!</li>
      <li>is that they don&#x27;t last but barely 3 minutes in the shower.  </li>

<li> Great product for a head cold or headache to steam yourself in the shower!</li>
<li> is that they don&#x27;t last but barely 3 minutes in the shower.  </li>
<li> I could barely even smell any eucalyptus far less</li>
<li> The fragrance does not last very long.</li>
<li> ok if you had a cold, if you used 3 of them.&lt;br</li>
<li> Strangely, the instructions tell you to let the water hit the tablet</li>
<li> Not realistic.</li>
<li> Have to sniff the tablet in order to smell the odor even when wet.  </li>
<li> Not really.</li>
<li> The eucalyptus fragrance is not very strong compared to their other products.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
<li> Not worth it</li>
<li> However, definitely not worth the price.</li>
<li> less than 5 minutes.</li>
<li> This is a waste of money.</li>
<li> Evaporated in just a few minutes and wasn&#x27;t as strong/potent as I would have wanted it to be.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> waste of money.  </li>
<li> They let off a subtle eucalyptus effervescent smell.  </li>
<li> Thought I&#x27;d would be relaxing but no good.</li>
<li> If you have a cold or flu, I would recommend using all 3 of them to get the effect that you will probably want because it is not very strong</li>
<li> Not a great substitute for Shower Soothers.  </li>
<li> Our family had a horrible upper respiratory virus, and nothing was helping with the sinus and nasal congestion....</li>
<li> I&#x27;m just not impressed with them.</li>
<li> false advertising!</li>
<li> Allergies, cold and flu season?  </li>
<li> The aroma was stronger and did help in soothing my cold.</li>
<li> Tablets aren&#x27;t bad, but if you say 24 pack, I expect atleast  a pack of 24 tablets</li>
<li> I purchased these tablets in place of the discontinued Sudacare tablets and was greatly disappointed.  </li>
<li> I am very unhappy with this product.</li>

    <li> Easy way to put this JUNK!  Not worth the money, save it and go for a better product.  These smell better in the box and does not work in the shower.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The scent lasts barely a minute.  (I have lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint.)  The tablet dissolves quickly:  You blink and it&#x27;s gone.  Strangely, the instructions tell you to let the water hit the tablet and you face the tablet.  Not realistic.</li>
    <li> Tablets aren&#x27;t bad, but if you say 24 pack, I expect atleast  a pack of 24 tablets&lt;br /&gt;not 3 measley tablets</li>
    <li> Not as much scent as I wanted...but the cost was not that much....compared to others...</li>
    <li> Not a great substitute for Shower Soothers.  Definitely didn&#x27;t release as much menthol or eucalyptus as Shower Soothers used to.  Would not buy again.  I&#x27;ll try a home made remedy first.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  Have to sniff the tablet in order to smell the odor even when wet.  Will pay more next time for another product that emanates the odor</li>
    <li> Thought this item would be great for colds.. like other product,(sudacare) but it doesn&#x27;t come near to it.  Great aromatherapy if that is what you looking for.</li>
    <li> The item was described as a 24 pack.  I received three tablets.  I have requested the balance of my order, so we&#x27;ll see what happens.</li>
    <li> Says 24 pack but only got a box with 3 in it.  false advertising!</li>
    <li> Works great. However, definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Good as the real Shower Soothers? No. Did they work great for my sinuses? Not really. Cure for writer&#x27;s block!? Why, yes. It does appear that knock off Shower Soothers may be the cure for writer&#x27;s block, and for that they get 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this item looking for a substitute for no longer available Sudacare tablets. I am very unhappy with this product. I unwrapped and placed in the back of the shower so the water did not stream directly onto it. It did not even last 3 minutes. The scent was strong when first in contact with water then nothing. I would not recommend buying these to anyone. Make your own..</li>
    <li> have spa day every Sat. good thing</li>
    <li> These are great for opening my sinuses w/o adding more pills to my already large quantity of meds</li>
    <li> REALLY ENJOYED IT AND IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES..WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IT ! IT SMELLS GOOD TOO!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great for that spa smell!</li>
    <li> I love using these shower tabs.  They let off a subtle eucalyptus effervescent smell.  I just wish they lasted longer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these! Great product for a head cold or headache to steam yourself in the shower! Smell great!</li>
    <li> I purchased these tablets in place of the discontinued Sudacare tablets and was greatly disappointed.  While it possessed the scent of eucalyptus, it had no strenth for clearing sinus blockage...I say get a Neti Pot</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find this product in any of our local stores, so I was glad to find it on line.  The eucalyptus tabs work great in the shower to relieve sinus pressure.  I would recommend these to any one.</li>
    <li> I have always liked the Aura Cacia product line so I thought that I would try their shower tablets after seeing them in the store. You are suppose to unwrap them and place them on the shower floor and allow the shower water run over the tablets and allow it to bring the aromatherapy scent into the air. If you have a cold or flu, I would recommend using all 3 of them to get the effect that you will probably want because it is not very strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- I think these would work ok if you had a cold, if you used 3 of them.&lt;br /&gt;- They do take a while to dissolve, but the fragrance goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The eucalyptus fragrance is not very strong compared to their other products.&lt;br /&gt;- The fragrance does not last very long. It lasted around 4 minutes in the shower without it being in the direct flow of water. The tablet lasted around 7 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: I will not be purchasing these again, I will be searching for another brand as I was not fully satisfied with the Aura Cacia Shower Tablets.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all.  I could barely even smell any eucalyptus far less have it be therapeutic or pleasurable .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;total waste of money.  I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> These are the best for those mornings you have a cold and really don&#x27;t want to get ready for work. A nice hot shower with one of these in it decongests you and wakes you up so you can face the day, they are a staple in our house for sure!</li>
    <li> Add these to your shower to open up those sinuses! I love them.  Allergies, cold and flu season?  Load up on these.  Hot, steamy shower and Aura Cacia Eucalyptus tabs.</li>
    <li> ...sinus congestion. Our family had a horrible upper respiratory virus, and nothing was helping with the sinus and nasal congestion....until this product.&lt;br /&gt;It soothed emotionally, as well as physically.&lt;br /&gt;Will stock up on more.</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday.  I like the scent especially battling a infection with my sinuses.  The only draw back I have is that they don&#x27;t last but barely 3 minutes in the shower.  And when I am needing to take a shower that&#x27;s longer For the vapors and the steam to help with my breathing I ended up having to use 2 out of the 3 in the package.  So if they would last longer I would have given them a higher rating.  But they still do not have the stronger vapors that the old Sudacare, ones had sure miss those.</li>
    <li> Tablet last about 5-10 minutes. Could barely smell it in the shower. Thought I&#x27;d would be relaxing but no good. Definitely would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> terrible-I should&#x27;ve just bought a bottle which would&#x27;ve been much stronger and given 10 times the use for the same price</li>
    <li> Love love love love these tabs!! I have tried the peppermint and the lavendar. Next up is the eucalyptus and I cant wait. I also cant wait to share them with others as a stocking stuffer this holiday. The tabs stay the entire shower. I believe the directions say to place under direct water but I out mine in the corner of the shower and the let out tons of aroma. I even end up having to then put it under the direct shower so it will disintegrate. Love it love it love it!!!! Wish I could find them in bigger packs though.</li>
    <li> Evaporated in just a few minutes and wasn&#x27;t as strong/potent as I would have wanted it to be.  However, they did work as advertised.  I&#x27;m just not impressed with them.</li>
    <li> These shower tablets smell great and they take a long time to dissolve but the smell fades really quickly. It is released really quickly and towards the end of your shower, even if the tablet hasn&#x27;t fully dissolved yet, the smell fades away. Wont spend money on these again. Not worth it</li>
    <li> Scent is barely recognizable, and does not last long.  The smell is not what I would call eucalyptus but more of a cleaning product.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money. I followed instructions exactly, and you could not tell it was even in the shower.</li>
    <li> They smell great but just disappear too quickly...less than 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> These were alot better than the Level tablets. The aroma was stronger and did help in soothing my cold. I would try them again.</li>
    <li> Used one of these for the first time yesterday.. Couldn&#x27;t even smell the Eucalyptus unless I was bending down.  As for clearing sinuses... Yeah, didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
