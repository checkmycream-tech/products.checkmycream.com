      <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>It would also make a top notch gift for someone you care about; it shows thoughtfulness to give something that shows they deserve to be pampered.</li>
      <li>More than 1/2 the time it doesn&#x27;t even heat up at all.  </li>
      <li>The Hot Lashes Heated Eyelash Curler is without a doubt the absolute best eyelash curler ever made!!  </li>
      <li>I have Loved the Hot Lashes heated eyelash system for many years, truly curls my eyelashes beautifully and the curl last all day.</li>
      <li>The cheap heated eyelash curlers you can get at any drug store work better.  </li>
      <li>This product has a great premise but that is as far as it went.</li>
      <li>I would strongly advise you to give Luminous Lashes a try.</li>
      <li>I bought a second one just in case the first one wore out, but it still works perfectly.</li>
      <li>i enjoy this eye lash curler..</li>
      <li>This is a item with great potential!</li>
      <li>Thanks for such a great product!</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>The best thing this curler has its the heated machine but is very pricey and its job can be substituted with a simple hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I bought the Hot Lash unit when it came out 12 yrs ago and loved it so much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited about getting this product.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly as described and more.  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to use the product yet, but I certainly wanted to correct the 1 star I gave based on receiving a product that did not work.</li>
      <li>He came through for me and is giving me a full refund.</li>
      <li>It usually takes me a good 20 minutes of fighting with it to get warm at all</li>
      <li>I am a big fan and so supportive of the Luminous Lashes Beauty line of products, They are all top notch~</li>
      <li>I contacted the company and they seemed very willing to replace the unit.</li>
      <li>I have been using hot lashes for years now!  </li>
      <li>This one is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Love the concept though because it curls better than any other curler.</li>
      <li>The lash curler does not stay on the heated portion of the appliance, it always snaps right off and the heating mechanism shuts off.  </li>
      <li>This gave me the best curl that I have ever had, but sadly, it only lasted a few weeks before it broke.</li>
      <li>I use it once a week on very straight, unruly lashes.  </li>
      <li>Nothing curls like Hot Lashes.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it will get so hot you can&#x27;t touch your eyes without getting burned.</li>
      <li>TRY HOT LASHES NOW</li>
      <li>I have tried many different types of &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; curlers and none work as well as this one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to duplicate the curl with a regular eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>or like I said, then it will get really really hot.</li>
      <li>I ordered this to replace my Hot Lashes unit which I purchases in February, 2007.</li>
      <li>I owned one of the first models and after 2 years, it died.  </li>
      <li>I do wait a second when I take it out of the unit and test it on my hand to make sure it&#x27;s not going to burn the tender skin around the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They were very understanding about the lost shipment and did try to do the right thing.</li>
      <li>If you have stubborn lashes this is answer &amp; if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have easily curled lashes you would enjoy this for the obvious glamor, efficiency &amp; mmmmm....</li>
      <li>Keeps my eyelashes curled all day and can&#x27;t live with out it!!  </li>
      <li>On 5/29/2012 the company made good on the missing item and sent me a new one.</li>
      <li>Unlike the original unit, this one heats the metal lash curler to a hot temperature and you have to wait for it to cool down before you can even get it close to your eyelashes.</li>
      <li>If anyone can help me find out if my replacement shipped, it would be greatly appreciated.</li>
      <li>the soothing feel of the heat really is comforting somehow.</li>
      <li>It works very well and takes about 10-20 seconds on each eye.  </li>
      <li>I then put mascara over my lashes and i am ready to go.</li>
      <li>I have those eyelashes that stick straight out</li>
      <li>It really works, and my eyelashes stay curled much longer.  </li>
      <li>and you know you are ready to use it.</li>
      <li>It works very well to curl my lashes...</li>
      <li>I plug in the eyelash curler and in 60 seconds the eyelash curler is ready to use.</li>
      <li>This gets too hot on the part that will actually touch your face, if it gets hot at all!  </li>
      <li>so it is cool enough to use.</li>
      <li>The second is this particular device gets extremely hot making my curler so hot that it will literally cause a severe burn to your eyelid.</li>
      <li>With this particular purchase the adaptor is still working 1 month after purchase.</li>
      <li>It heats quickly, and curls lashes in seconds with all day lasting</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best heated eyelash curler I have ever used. Keeps my eyelashes curled all day and can&#x27;t live with out it!!  Love the adaptor, gets warmer faster than by using the batteries:)  Must have for my daily beauty routine~</li>
    <li> This is a item with great potential! However, it is made of perhaps the flimsiest piece of plastic I&#x27;ve ever owned. The other problem is as the curler is being heated it wants to pop out of its seating constantly. Sometimes I have to manually hold it in the seating to start the heating element. What&#x27;s great about it and why I even bother is the non-crimped curl it gives to the lashes~really beautiful. I&#x27;ve not been able to duplicate the curl with a regular eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyelash curler on april 5th, 2012 and its been a almost a month since I have it and so far is still working. I have purchased curler before from different sellers and normally they will only last between 2-5 months depending on manufacturer and quality. The heater of the curler takes about 2 minutes to heat and once is ready the red light stays red and you know you are ready to use it. The problem with this curler is the curler itself which is very bad quality and doesn&#x27;t fit or curl nice because of it poor shape. I have a shu uemura curler that i bought in ebay for a dollar and its quality its outstanding! It fits perfectly in eye and curls nicely.It has last me for a year and is still working as new. The other problem with this curler is that the adaptor stops working after a couple months.With this particular purchase the adaptor is still working 1 month after purchase.The best thing this curler has its the heated machine but is very pricey and its job can be substituted with a simple hair dryer. I bought this curler because I can curl faster than with hair dryer and the black pad of curler doesn&#x27;t melt like when heating curler with a regular hair dryer.Overall I give this curler 2 stars because it does the job somewhat good yet price is high, durability short and bad curler. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Update- On 5/29/2012 the company made good on the missing item and sent me a new one. They were very understanding about the lost shipment and did try to do the right thing. I have not been able to use the product yet, but I certainly wanted to correct the 1 star I gave based on receiving a product that did not work. Thank you for a great customer service effort. More on the product itself after I have used it.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited about getting this product. Sadly it arrived with a broken case. I contacted the company and they seemed very willing to replace the unit. They did not even require that I send the broken one back.Accidents do happen and I respect any merchant who goes out of their way to make sure the client receives a good product in perfect condition. As I have been waiting for the product, nothing has arrived. I am trying to be patient, but the time is exceeding normal/ customary time. As a result I have paid for a product that I can never use. Therefore rating the product is impossible. I do not want to give the company a bad rating as I am thinking that my product could still show up anytime, which would verify that thy kept their promise. If anyone can help me find out if my replacement shipped, it would be greatly appreciated. I have not received any notice of such.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to actually receiving,using and reviewing this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Jan</li>
    <li> I owned one of the first models and after 2 years, it died.  I saw this one and liked the updated version which has the metal heating unit. Love--love, love this product---I use it every day and my lashes have the best curl ever!that lasts and lasts!  Thanks for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I have those eyelashes that stick straight out and although I curl them with a standard eyelash curler I only get so much curl and it doesn&#x27;t last very long (better with waterproof mascara).  Now that I have this little wonder my lashes stay curled ALL day long no matter what kind of mascara I wear or even if I don&#x27;t wear mascara.  Woohoo!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I click it down for it to heat while I do my undereye concealer and any plucking and then by the time I&#x27;m done with that the little red blinky light is solid and off I go with the curling.  I do wait a second when I take it out of the unit and test it on my hand to make sure it&#x27;s not going to burn the tender skin around the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a BIG fan although I&#x27;m nervous from other reviewers that this thing is going to croak since I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks.  Please don&#x27;t die on me my little miracle worker!!!</li>
    <li> This gave me the best curl that I have ever had, but sadly, it only lasted a few weeks before it broke.</li>
    <li> Awesome....lashes look long curled and stay that way. Alittle shea butter on lashes after curled keeps them conditioned.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever purchased! I have tried many other types &amp; they were just a waste of money! This one is worth every penny. I LOVE IT! Thank you</li>
    <li> Have had two in the past years,  both stopped heating.  So far so good but it did have directions to not put batteries in and run on electricity.  Hopefully that was the problem before.  I have short lashes and it curls enough to see them.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  It is great for enhancing the look of one&#x27;s eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This is the best heated eyelash curling system out there!  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheaper knock offs..... TRY HOT LASHES NOW and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  I&#x27;ve used HOT LASHES for years and the improvements to this system are excellent!  I use it every day and get tons of compliments all the time.  This is a definite MUST HAVE in your Beauty regimen!  And if they still sell the awesome mascara that goes with it, try that as well !</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say at all. I&#x27;m 54 and have long lashes but just like my hair no curl ever lasted. If I used primers and extra coats of mascara it looked even worse. These beauties give me a perfect curl, which in turn does stay curled without 1/2 gallon of mascara. If you have stubborn lashes this is answer &amp; if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have easily curled lashes you would enjoy this for the obvious glamor, efficiency &amp; mmmmm....the soothing feel of the heat really is comforting somehow. It would also make a top notch gift for someone you care about; it shows thoughtfulness to give something that shows they deserve to be pampered. Where to buy it? I would strongly advise you to give Luminous Lashes a try. They are fast, good pricing, &amp; most importantly, their customer service is absolutely as good as it gets; they listen and they literally do LOVE their customers. Be prepared to look, feel and be treated like royalty!</li>
    <li> I have Loved the Hot Lashes heated eyelash system for many years, truly curls my eyelashes beautifully and the curl last all day. Great beauty purchase at a great price. I am a big fan and so supportive of the Luminous Lashes Beauty line of products, They are all top notch~ Hope this review helps, 5 starts all the way! the best, Ingrid</li>
    <li> Just recieved the unit today and tried it out. Not that impressed at all especially for the price I paid. The curler got extremely hot and after letting it cool for a few seconds it still burned the tender part of my eyelids. Once cooled enough to apply to lashes it doesnt want to curl the lash because its not hot enough. They should make a rubber guard for the edges of this curler and it would work better. Plus the unit itself is too big and bulky. I should&#x27;ve just went for something cheaper and smaller.</li>
    <li> This product has a great premise but that is as far as it went. I bought it because I was tired of using the blow dryer to heat up the curler for optimal results. The problem was with the design not following function. The eyelash curler would not stay in position long enough to heat up.. …..just kept popping up off the base. The only way I could make it work was to hold it down the entire time. I could do it quicker the old blow dryer way. I should have tried to return it but waited so long I finally put it in the Goodwill box.</li>
    <li> I gave a bad review yesterday about this seller and I did it to soon. He came through for me and is giving me a full refund. I bought 2 -- 1 works and the other did not.     Sondra</li>
    <li> The cheap heated eyelash curlers you can get at any drug store work better.  This gets too hot on the part that will actually touch your face, if it gets hot at all!  More than 1/2 the time it doesn&#x27;t even heat up at all.  Would NOT recommend</li>
    <li> The lash curler does not stay on the heated portion of the appliance, it always snaps right off and the heating mechanism shuts off.  This is a defective product and I would not recommend it.  This appliance is useless and I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I love this product except for a couple of issues. One being that my eyelash curler won&#x27;t stay down so I have to put a piece of paper in the slot and wedge the handle in between to keep it down. The second is this particular device gets extremely hot making my curler so hot that it will literally cause a severe burn to your eyelid. I&#x27;ve heard that this is not normal and that its suppose to get hot,&lt;br /&gt;just not that hot. The device has been this way since the day I received it. Love the concept though because it curls better than any other curler. I&#x27;m sure I have a defective device and others won&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
    <li> Excellent! love it works great</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described and more.  I have been using the standard eye lash curler for years and decided to try out the Luminous Lashes.  The heated curler really does the trick with longevity and really helps my lashes stand out all day, especially coming from someone with shorter lashes - I HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
    <li> I use it once a week on very straight, unruly lashes.  It works very well and takes about 10-20 seconds on each eye.  Does not burn skin if accidentally touched.</li>
    <li> This is my second Hot Lashes unit.  My first lasted several years.  When it finally died, I ordered this one.  I like the plastic cover.  Nothing curls like Hot Lashes.  I&#x27;ve tried many small battery units in the $10 - $15 range and I&#x27;ve only ever found 1 that worked at all.  The Hot Lashes unit is the best.  It heats quickly, and curls lashes in seconds with all day lasting power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sometimes gets a little too hot.  If so, just hold it away from the heating unit a few seconds so it is cool enough to use.</li>
    <li> Mine never heated up so i returned.  Did not re-order.</li>
    <li> I have been using hot lashes for years now!  I must say its the best invention ever!!  I get the best curl every time I use it, my lashes look so sultry when I apply mascara.  Almost like I got extensions</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. Not sure what effect the heat does but she now just uses the eyelash curler thing and not the heated pad</li>
    <li> It works great.  Makes perfect eyelashes. You have to measure the heat.  It is very easy to handle.  I was very pleased with this fine product.</li>
    <li> I have deep set eyes and it is very difficult to get my lashes into the curler.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It was a birthday gift and I have been using it for 5 months and it is still functional and my eyelashes have never looked so good.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different types of &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; curlers and none work as well as this one.  It does get a little hot, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to cool down.  It works very well to curl my lashes...they just don&#x27;t want to stay that way for some reason.  However, I do like the look I ultimately get and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> love it - my lashes stay curled.</li>
    <li> I bought the Hot Lash unit when it came out 12 yrs ago and loved it so much. My old unit still has not gone bad but I wanted a new one so I just ordered the new and improved model and I am so happy with the product. I would recommend that you try it.</li>
    <li> Wow!! i enjoy this eye lash curler..it looks professional as well. But the biggest thing i liked about this purchase was the EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE above and beyond my expectations!!!!! Lets put it this way, the lady i worked with over the phone who represented this product/company- was a little slice of heaven! There are still good people and good companies who make sure you are 100% satisfied and care about service. She was so kind and appreciative of my patronage.  I wish everyone was this professional. Kudos to this representative and company. I recommend the product and the people who sell it! Bless them.</li>
    <li> The Hot Lashes Heated Eyelash Curler is without a doubt the absolute best eyelash curler ever made!!  It really works, and my eyelashes stay curled much longer.  I&#x27;ve had mine for at least 3 years.  I bought a second one just in case the first one wore out, but it still works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have small eyelashes so this curler helps with my eyelashes. I plug in the eyelash curler and in 60 seconds the eyelash curler is ready to use. I just have to crimp my eyelashes once to get that nice curl. I then put mascara over my lashes and i am ready to go.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace my Hot Lashes unit which I purchases in February, 2007. When I received the new unit, I plugged it in and waited for the light to go off just like in the past. Unlike the original unit, this one heats the metal lash curler to a hot temperature and you have to wait for it to cool down before you can even get it close to your eyelashes. Also, because the top portion of the lash curler is wider than the original lash curler, you cannot get it close to the base of your eyelashes like before. I am no longer a fan of this product and will be shopping around for something that works!</li>
    <li> This is my second Superstar Hot Lash  My 1st I had  for 20 years!!  I Love It!!!</li>
    <li> Cover broke immediately. It is never consistant with temperature. Sometimes it will get so hot you can&#x27;t touch your eyes without getting burned. After a few months, lash curler would not stay in the down postion to heat. It usually takes me a good 20 minutes of fighting with it to get warm at all or like I said, then it will get really really hot. I also ordered it with a 5 year deal where they would send me a new lash curler every year. I have yet to receive the first one and it&#x27;s been over a year and a half. Not pleased at all and would not re-purchase nor recommend. Way to expensive for the quality.</li>
