### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but I love the nails but not glue !!!</li>
      <li>Good for beginners like me</li>
      <li>The nails, instead of falling wiggling off because of a lack of good glue, were BREAKING OFF.</li>
      <li>I think is the good one but no</li>
      <li>I ordered these nails and they took a while to come but are very cute and cant wait to start using them</li>
      <li>Love this poduct!</li>
      <li>The nails are nice</li>
      <li>got it was in good shape love it happy to use it and much more of it thank so much</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered them.</li>
      <li>and I still have more to do.</li>
      <li>Otherwise the product is wonderful and i will be ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s probably because I need some more practice.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t crack and seem to stay on pretty good</li>
      <li>These tips break off WAY too easily.</li>
      <li>The themselves and the glue were fine</li>
      <li>I tried to put them on and they didn&#x27;t fit</li>
      <li>The glue is very strong, nails have not broken yet and it has been 3 days.</li>
      <li>The glue is good and sticks strong, but it is not the same brand used in the picture.</li>
      <li>Gonna be fun.</li>
      <li>For the price is ok if you are a professional at home works well</li>
      <li>I started doing my own nails at home rather than going to the salon, and these nails of the same quality as at the salon.  </li>
      <li>But they arrived about a month later maybe more.</li>
      <li>I used them the exact day they came in.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the item came in tact.</li>
      <li>It will  be a great way for her to do her own nails and quite a bit less expensive.</li>
      <li>Nails are good, can&#x27;t really mess up white tips.</li>
      <li>I really like the shape of these nails they stay on flat nails very well</li>
      <li>so i can still use them, but they did take a LOT longer than I thought they would and the nails were not in the best shape. :(</li>
      <li>and she was really estatic that she received the french white tips for the price they had them listed for!</li>
      <li>very cheap and poor product.</li>
      <li>First, the glue was not strong enough to hold the nails on, so I bought a stronger glue.</li>

<li> but, good grief!!!</li>
<li> I stopped using them and with half the amount of nails still there (having gone through half the container replacing and re-doing my gel as well) I have given up on hoping these nails would hold up even under the gel.</li>
<li> I will say though that some of them seem to be shaped a little oddly and need to be filed before putting them on.  </li>
<li> Never stick to my nail or my friends nails, horrible and cheap.</li>
<li> These White Acyrlic false nails were truly FALSE!</li>
<li> Im not happy with the quality</li>
<li> When the package arrived it was no glue and box was broken.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t stick even with crazy glue.</li>
<li> These nails are SORRY!</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t rate this bad cause</li>
<li> very unhappy with this product DO NOT BUY</li>
<li> I was very unhappy with their lack of strength.</li>
<li> Worst nail tips I&#x27;ve ever bought!  </li>

    <li> Never stick to my nail or my friends nails, horrible and cheap. Do NOT buY</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my girlfriend and even though the shipping was extremely long she did finally receive them and she was really estatic that she received the french white tips for the price they had them listed for! It will  be a great way for her to do her own nails and quite a bit less expensive.</li>
    <li> These tips break off WAY too easily. I was very unhappy with their lack of strength. First, the glue was not strong enough to hold the nails on, so I bought a stronger glue. But that was not the saving grace. The nails, instead of falling wiggling off because of a lack of good glue, were BREAKING OFF. Literally, one small slip of the finger and the nail would split down the middle. I stopped using them and with half the amount of nails still there (having gone through half the container replacing and re-doing my gel as well) I have given up on hoping these nails would hold up even under the gel. All they do is split and break and take my gel manicure with it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Worst nail tips I&#x27;ve ever bought!  When they are cut with bunny clippers they instantly break in half</li>
    <li> I started doing my own nails at home rather than going to the salon, and these nails of the same quality as at the salon.  I save a ton of money doing them myself!  Love this poduct!</li>
    <li> I think is the good one but no</li>
    <li> got it was in good shape love it happy to use it and much more of it thank so much</li>
    <li> I ordered these about two months ago and knowing I oredered them from Hong Kong or whatever i knew they would take a long time. But they arrived about a month later maybe more. When i got them the box was very damaged and one of the hinges was broken, the box was cracked so i cant really even close it. The themselves and the glue were fine so i can still use them, but they did take a LOT longer than I thought they would and the nails were not in the best shape. :(</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rate this bad cause well they&#x27;re nails. But one thing about the buyer I was upset about was it said, I read it, the nail glue was included. And it wasn&#x27;t. But that&#x27;s being petty.</li>
    <li> I like these nails  hshahahhahahhahahahahababababahahahahahHahahahHa plus we also like everything else well not every thing but every thing Mahan man</li>
    <li> very cheap and poor product. you can not file the nails because they bend. very unhappy with this product DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> For the price is ok if you are a professional at home works well</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several months.  I have never had one break.  I do put acrylic over them.  I will say though that some of them seem to be shaped a little oddly and need to be filed before putting them on.  Thankfully that isn&#x27;t the case for every size.  If it wasn&#x27;t  for that, I would have given them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I really like the shape of these nails they stay on flat nails very well but that&#x27;s probably because I need some more practice. They don&#x27;t crack and seem to stay on pretty good</li>
    <li> totally what i expected.Glad I ordered them. Will be using them for manicures for a long time now. Gonna be fun.</li>
    <li> I ordered these nails and they took a while to come but are very cute and cant wait to start using them</li>
    <li> The day I got it I use it for me and my sis and I still have more to do.</li>
    <li> The glue is very strong, nails have not broken yet and it has been 3 days. Good for beginners like me</li>
    <li> These nails are SORRY! PERIOD! They don&#x27;t stick even with crazy glue. I will never purchase this again! EVER!</li>
    <li> The glue bottle has no glue in it but I love the nails but not glue !!!</li>
    <li> they weren&#x27;t what I thought they were....</li>
    <li> These nails where inexpensive I knew that but, good grief!!!! I guess you truly get what you pay for! These White Acyrlic false nails were truly FALSE!</li>
    <li> I used them the exact day they came in. Shipping was fast and the item came in tact. The glue is good and sticks strong, but it is not the same brand used in the picture. Otherwise the product is wonderful and i will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Im not happy with the quality</li>
    <li> I just wish the box were a little bigger</li>
    <li> The nails are nice but mine didn&#x27;t come with any nail glue. But overall I like them and plus they came 2 weeks before they were suppose to</li>
    <li> I got the nails in a bag. NO GLUE OR BOX included. I was disappointed considering i already had white tips and was buying this mostly for the box.</li>
    <li> they aren&#x27;t even nails there just shaped like it didn&#x27;t even come with glue I tried to put them on and they didn&#x27;t fit and they didn&#x27;t even stck to my nails theses suck don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Nails are good, can&#x27;t really mess up white tips. But the reason I ordered this was because of the glue included and the box. When the package arrived it was no glue and box was broken. Not a big deal but it was the reason I ordered this one.</li>
