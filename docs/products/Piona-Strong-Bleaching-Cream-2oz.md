### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great!!</li>
      <li>This cream gave me great skin tone and lightened to perfection.</li>
      <li>It smells good.</li>
      <li>However, I gave it a fair shot.  </li>
      <li>my sister started and she happy with the results too:)</li>
      <li>This product has a very strong industrial scent that makes it almost impractical to use.  </li>
      <li>Its very very strong.</li>
      <li>I have tried stronger bleaching creams that have been more effective.</li>
      <li>Honestly ambi would do a better job of lightning discolorations  if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, me</li>
      <li>This cream is now a very important part of my beauty regiment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not much better using night time.  </li>
      <li>but know I will need more than 2oz.</li>
      <li>now I love it</li>
      <li>Well, this cream is not as strong as it claiims to be.</li>
      <li>Just smells like strong lemons.</li>
      <li>It really works!!!</li>
      <li>This jar was 3/4 full and there was no sign of leakage which tells me this was shipped in that state.</li>
      <li>this is so creamy that it spills everywhere all the time you can&#x27;t really get your money&#x27;s worth because if you carry it around or turn over on accident it&#x27;s spilled all out on the outsides of the container, and it didn&#x27;t help much with lightning the skin I am on a quest for a better bleaching cream</li>
      <li>The only thing is that it can be very drying to your skin so use a good moisturiser.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t want to use first thing in the morning because I hesitate  being close to business associates in the event they notice</li>
      <li>Thanks Piona</li>
      <li>but I gave it a 4 star because after a couple of use it started to break my face ,but  it will bleach you really fast.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal for this type of cream.  </li>
      <li>i like it because it works fast.</li>
      <li>and it really works.  </li>
      <li>Finished the whole bottle nd</li>
      <li>This cream really works.</li>
      <li>works but after consistent use, the sides of your face might darken, and skin very very sensitive to the sun.</li>
      <li>You have to make sure you use it everyday and night and put it on evenly.  </li>
      <li>It does help with helping new breakouts.</li>
      <li>The only thing I need to really say is be careful because you will look a lilttle different because it is a strong bleaching cream.  </li>
      <li>I like it so far</li>
      <li>So, in my opinion, I would advice to use a different cream with effects that last much longer.</li>
      <li>After just a couple of weeks the spots are barely noticeable!</li>
      <li>gives you a very smooth brightened complexion in a few weeks, not oily, will remove dark spots from skin.</li>
      <li>the 4oz was 40$ waste of money o an, I used it on a consistent basis night and morning!</li>
      <li>I jst want the darker spots on my face to actually vanish and it is working thus far.  </li>
      <li>and I had more than a few dark spots.</li>
      <li>The change was gradual but after just a week my skin was radiant and dark blotches had faded so much</li>
      <li>The price is ok it could be a little cheaper for it being so small.  </li>

<li> Waste.</li>
<li> And Esoterica and Porcelana both have strong bad smell!  </li>
<li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it just a small amount.  </li>
<li> separate and together in the past &amp; never broke out.</li>
<li> I do reccomend this cream for anyone trying to remove ugly marks due to acne or scarring.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not that bad</li>

    <li> THIS PRODUCT AS A CHEMICAL THAT DAMAGES SKIN CALLED  HYDROQUINO, I SENT IT BACK IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a 61 year old Black woman with caramel skin. It was drab and I had more than a few dark spots. This cream gave me great skin tone and lightened to perfection. It really works!!! I was careful to use it twice a day. The change was gradual but after just a week my skin was radiant and dark blotches had faded so much my husband even noticed. This cream is now a very important part of my beauty regiment.</li>
    <li> Great!! See a different in days I&#x27;ve been use for a while now I love it my sister started and she happy with the results too:)</li>
    <li> i like it because it works fast. i don&#x27;t like it because once you stop using it, your skin will break out and become very dark</li>
    <li> I like it so far but know I will need more than 2oz. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I can see small changes in new spots but not yet the old. It does help with helping new breakouts.</li>
    <li> This cream really works. It lightened my complexion in about a week to two weeks, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Well, this cream is not as strong as it claiims to be. I have tried stronger bleaching creams that have been more effective. It smells good. You can try it, but it takes a long time to work. its not a miracle cream.</li>
    <li> Alright actually I bought the four oz size and already did a review on it. Number one this is so creamy that it spills everywhere all the time you can&#x27;t really get your money&#x27;s worth because if you carry it around or turn over on accident it&#x27;s spilled all out on the outsides of the container, and it didn&#x27;t help much with lightning the skin I am on a quest for a better bleaching cream the 4oz was 40$ waste of money o an, I used it on a consistent basis night and morning! Waste. Honestly ambi would do a better job of lightning discolorations  if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, me I&#x27;m a mutt I have a really pale face with dark arms and hands(hereditary)....</li>
    <li> When I received this product it was wrapped in bubble wrap. Once I opened the jar, it,didn&#x27;t have a protective plastic cover or the round styrofoam disc that cosmetic products have. This jar was 3/4 full and there was no sign of leakage which tells me this was shipped in that state. After using it for 10 days, the only difference is small pimlpes on my face that,will become dark! have used G+G (gylogic acid) &amp; Fair&amp;White (Hydro) separate and together in the past &amp; never broke out. I want my money back!</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong industrial scent that makes it almost impractical to use.  Don&#x27;t want to use first thing in the morning because I hesitate  being close to business associates in the event they notice the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much better using night time.  However, I gave it a fair shot.  It&#x27;s been several weeks using at least once per day with zero noticeable difference in the area that I was trying to lighten.</li>
    <li> The cream works well but I gave it a 4 star because after a couple of use it started to break my face ,but  it will bleach you really fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who had dark spots due to ache. After just a couple of weeks the spots are barely noticeable!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal for this type of cream.  I have been using this cream for a while now and it really works.  It may take ome time but it does work.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it just a small amount.  If you are trying to get your skin to be all one color then this is the cream for you.  You have to make sure you use it everyday and night and put it on evenly.  The price is ok it could be a little cheaper for it being so small.  The only thing I need to really say is be careful because you will look a lilttle different because it is a strong bleaching cream.  I did notice if you stop using it even though the marks are gone you might be back to your same complexion.  I jst want the darker spots on my face to actually vanish and it is working thus far.  I do reccomend this cream for anyone trying to remove ugly marks due to acne or scarring.  This is no hype this stuff does work.</li>
    <li> works! gives you a very smooth brightened complexion in a few weeks, not oily, will remove dark spots from skin.</li>
    <li> Finished the whole bottle nd nothing not even a slight difference. .I used it for over 2 weeks day and night ..</li>
    <li> Its been 3 weeks and I already see a difference. this product rocks! I will defintely purchase again. thank you</li>
    <li> And Esoterica and Porcelana both have strong bad smell!  This product smell but it&#x27;s not that bad and it goes away. Just smells like strong lemons. So going to keep using it and I&#x27;ll let you know!</li>
    <li> I have tried other lightening creams that did not meet the standard of my expectation. Piona has indeed came through for me. I only use it to lighten acne spots which clears up after one week of continued use morning and evening. The only thing is that it can be very drying to your skin so use a good moisturiser.  I have recommended this product to my family and friends... Thanks Piona (:</li>
    <li> Its very very strong. I am African American with blackspots it evened it out in 2weeks.The product does what it advertise</li>
    <li> works but after consistent use, the sides of your face might darken, and skin very very sensitive to the sun. You will also notice that the minute you stop using it, your skin will immediately start to get darker as it were before you started using it. So, in my opinion, I would advice to use a different cream with effects that last much longer.</li>
