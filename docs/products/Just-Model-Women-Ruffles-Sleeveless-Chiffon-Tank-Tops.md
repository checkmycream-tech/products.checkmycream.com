    <li> Tops are pretty, light and very feminine...I ordered brown and green. Thank goodness I read the reviews before I ordered.  I am 5&#x27;02&amp;#34;, 119 lbs. and generally wear a Petite Small.  Due to previous comments about sizing, I ordered them in XL.  They fit nicely, other than slightly snug around my chest - I am a bit chesty for my size (wear 34D).  Hope this helps out when ordering.</li>
