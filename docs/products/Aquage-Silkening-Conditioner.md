      <li>Awesome stuff.  </li>
      <li>The product smells delicious.</li>
      <li>Very good conditioner!</li>
      <li>The best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is also the best.</li>
      <li>Even my hairdresser made a comment about how great my hair feels, before I even told her I had switched conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>

      <li>Never ever used a better conditioner!</li>
      <li>I have used this conditioner many times before and love it!</li>
      <li>Great for daily use or when your hair just needs a great conditioning treatment.</li>
      <li>I would rate it a step above the healing conditioner (although I think that is also a great product and leaves my hair feeling great).</li>
      <li>It came on time but with tape over the top that I struggled to peel all residue off.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>This is a great conditioner for dry hair.</li>
      <li>I would still purchase again without a pump as it&#x27;s an excellent conditioner for course dry hair that tends to frizz in high humidity.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the past 50 years and this is by far the best I have found.</li>
      <li>It has never failed to meet my expectations, and it doesn&#x27;t strip my color.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I got ripped off on the smaller container, but this one has much more than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I saved it thinking it may be useful in the future and after cleaning it up the pump works fine.</li>
      <li>This would still be a little more than I like to pay, but it is worth every cent.</li>
      <li>hair is growing faster and is much stronger and healthier feeling and looking.</li>
      <li>My hair is totally managable, silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Did not come with a pump, but i dont really care for one anyway.</li>
      <li>No they want me to ship them back in original box - post office will not accept a package with goo coming out of it.  </li>
      <li>also love that this conditioner does not leave my hair heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I waited a few weeks to leave a review for this product.</li>
      <li>Received my product today, since i live in the sellers area it was hand delivered to my door.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Aquage products in general</li>
      <li>I thought I would try the Aquage Silkenin Conditioner, and WOW.</li>
      <li>I am nearly a month into my use and have barely scratched the surface.</li>
      <li>Arrived very time and just as expected.</li>

<li> Keeps my crazy curly hair nice and soft with less frizz.</li>

<li> I spent 40 minutes on hold to talk to customer service rep, thinking there would be no issue in resolving, I offered photos of the containers.  </li>
<li> My wife will not buy this size product, or any other, from Sleekhair again.</li>
<li> I have never used the Aquage conditioner, but i do use other Aquage products.</li>
<li> Digging it out with one hand while holding the container with the other and then trying to get the lid on while in the shower can be a hassle.</li>
<li> Fragrance.net is not worth the hassle - use another supplier.</li>
<li> It was a mess.  </li>
<li> LUV LUV LUV this product for my thick curly long hair.</li>
<li> A little problem with shipping, but the seller correct the issue.  </li>
<li> No more store bought for me,ever.</li>
<li> Nor were e-mails to Amazon about the false advertising.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you are looking for a conditioner that makes your hair feel like silken strands.  This is the one for you!!!  I&#x27;ve tried many products over the past 50 years and this is by far the best I have found.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I waited a few weeks to leave a review for this product. I started out with the 5.6 ounce tube, which lasted me about 5 weeks and cost about $25. I was hoping that this 16 ounce bottle would last about 4 months for $45. This would still be a little more than I like to pay, but it is worth every cent. However, this container is going to last me forever. I am nearly a month into my use and have barely scratched the surface. Maybe I got ripped off on the smaller container, but this one has much more than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is growing faster and is much stronger and healthier feeling and looking. Even my hairdresser made a comment about how great my hair feels, before I even told her I had switched conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this conditioner does not leave my hair heavy or greasy. My hair greases up easily, and I have to wash every day, and I have not had a problem with this. I will say that I use my usual shampoo - Neutrogena clean volume shampoo - with this, but even with this shampoo I am not able to use any moisturizing conditioners, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I would give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would prefer some type of pump bottle or something. Digging it out with one hand while holding the container with the other and then trying to get the lid on while in the shower can be a hassle. But I can just find a pump bottle somewhere else to use.</li>
    <li> Received my product today, since i live in the sellers area it was hand delivered to my door. I have never used the Aquage conditioner, but i do use other Aquage products. Delivery was prompt. The product smells delicious. Did not come with a pump, but i dont really care for one anyway. Will be doing business with seller again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does not come with the pump but I had one from the Aquage healing conditioner I bought years ago. I saved it thinking it may be useful in the future and after cleaning it up the pump works fine. I would still purchase again without a pump as it&#x27;s an excellent conditioner for course dry hair that tends to frizz in high humidity. I would rate it a step above the healing conditioner (although I think that is also a great product and leaves my hair feeling great). After moving to Florida I needed the extra silkening effect so I went chose this one instead of the healing conditioner, which I&#x27;ve used for years. If the price decreases it&#x27;s worth 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner for dry hair. My hair is softer while using it.</li>
    <li> LUV LUV LUV this product for my thick curly long hair. Great for daily use or when your hair just needs a great conditioning treatment. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as leave-in; might cause an oily gummy look. It definitely tames my fro in any type of weather and humidity.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for years.  It has never failed to meet my expectations, and it doesn&#x27;t strip my color.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Despite pictures of a jar with a pump to ease uzse. The product was delivered by Sleekhair without any pump. E-mails to Sleekhair requesting a pump were not retsponded to. Nor were e-mails to Amazon about the false advertising. The conditioner itself is excellent but balky to have in a shower absent a pump attachment. My wife will not buy this size product, or any other, from Sleekhair again.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I have ever used. The shampoo is also the best. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Arrived very time and just as expected. I love this product and am so happy I can save money buying online vs in the salon.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser introduced me to Aquage Shampoo and Conditioner. I just love it. My hair is totally managable, silky and smooth. I thought I would try the Aquage Silkenin Conditioner, and WOW. Nothing else like it.Will use nothing else. No more store bought for me,ever.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these - both arrived in damaged (shattered) containers with the contents spilled out throughout the box.  It was a mess.  I spent 40 minutes on hold to talk to customer service rep, thinking there would be no issue in resolving, I offered photos of the containers.  No they want me to ship them back in original box - post office will not accept a package with goo coming out of it.  And it is odd that I ordered 4 items, 2 of which was this product and both of those containers where damaged, the other two of different products were not damaged, just covered in the contents of the two shattered containers.  Fragrance.net is not worth the hassle - use another supplier.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon LLC.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  A little problem with shipping, but the seller correct the issue.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very good conditioner! I prefer a pump but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I highly recommend Aquage products in general</li>
    <li> Never ever used a better conditioner! I would never switch to anything different. My hair is way more manageable than ever before and looks shinier and healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  Keeps my crazy curly hair nice and soft with less frizz. I would recommend it to anyone with dry/dull hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner many times before and love it! It came on time but with tape over the top that I struggled to peel all residue off.</li>
