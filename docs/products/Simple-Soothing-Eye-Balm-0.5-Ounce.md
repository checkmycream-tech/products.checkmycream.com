      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>For now I will continue using Palmer&#x27;s, while searching for an eye cream that is as effective but without dyes or fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This eye balm has a really nice, tingling sensation.</li>
      <li>Nice eye balm.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find a good one yet.</li>
      <li>It gives the area under my eyes a nice dewy glow w/o being too shiney.  </li>
      <li>light and very nice for eyelids</li>
      <li>Although this product doesn&#x27;t contain any distinguishable ingredients that specifically target aging, it is still a very good, light product that I enjoy putting around my eyes.</li>
      <li>On a whim I purchased this eye cream and so far I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
      <li>A very light weight, almost greaseless formula that still makes your eyes feel moisturized without feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>It is very light, but doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>It nicely hydrated my under eye area, making it healthier and much more easy to apply concealer over.</li>
      <li>I guess I was hoping for something more.  </li>
      <li>Better than the Murad eye cream that costs upwards of $20.</li>
      <li>With that said, I haven&#x27;t found anything better specifically for the skin under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It is just okay eye cream.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve found, and it does last a while if you use it as directed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my experiment in buying something different for my eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>How this product received so many 4 and 5 star ratings is a mystery.</li>
      <li>It is nice and light with no noticeable scent.  </li>
      <li>This is great and effective for aging, sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>:) Also, in terms of rating this product, I gave it a 4.</li>
      <li>Soon I&#x27;ll get more.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
      <li>So far, so good!</li>
      <li>This product smells pretty darn good but for sure wakes my eyes up.</li>
      <li>I have no idea if this works, but it feels nice and cool on my face when I apply in the mornings after working 13 hours.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>It is great for sensitive eyes, but if you are looking for something to help with crow&#x27;s feet, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>I love love love this line!The packaging and shipments were great besides the box being crushed!</li>
      <li>Shipped to me very quickly.</li>
      <li>This eye balm goes on easily and does not irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I have bought a lot of eye products that were high dollar that aren&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but it does its job just fine and moisturizes well without causing irritation.  </li>
      <li>I find it soothing and hydrating, softening the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>The price is also very good and reasonable through amazon, I paid more in the store for the same tube.</li>
      <li>I found that my concealer went on really smooth after applying this product, it did not cause my mascara to flake or smear</li>
      <li>Light and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>Relax and enjoy a soothing eye balm.</li>
      <li>I feel like it helps to smooth the  wrinkles around my eyes too.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s light.</li>
      <li>This eye balm is light weight and soothing.</li>
      <li>Feels smooth upon application.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good for the sensitive skin and the vitamin it contained is helpful to solve the problem of my skin.</li>
      <li>after the first application I felt relief from itching, burning, and didn&#x27;t feel the need to rub my eyes!!</li>
      <li>This is wonderfully suited to sensitive skin (which apparently I&#x27;ve got now).  </li>
      <li>The texture is fine, perhaps a tad greasy, but really not bad at all.</li>
      <li>The value is so worth it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different eye creams - and this one is the best by far.</li>
      <li>and this is perfect for cooling and soothing that irritated delicate, tissue around one&#x27;s eyes.</li>
      <li>it really does soothe my eyes love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like a good foot lotion which will, over time, heal the skin if used properly.  </li>
      <li>This is great for short term use - very soft and fine textured.  </li>
      <li>Gentle, so far so good.</li>
      <li>After a couple of months use, my wife sees a smoother and more vibrant skin</li>
      <li>However, the effect wears off too quick.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>After Origins changed their formulas or discontinued the products I used, I needed to find a replacement that was suitable for sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really like this eye balm. Lasts a long time, you only have to use a small amount and leaves skin soft with no burning for my sensitive eyes. Great Price!!...and good product. I ordered several more.</li>
    <li> Bought this eye cream for my son&#x27;s wedding, and read the good reviews it has.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is too early to leave a product review, since many things are in my head because of the wedding and I forget to put it on... I will write more in the near future....</li>
    <li> Very nice, hypoallergenic product for a competitive price.</li>
    <li> dissapointed -it really doesn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that helps to moisturize my dry eyelids. I put it on every morning before my eyeshadow and it works great and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> Though not a miracle worker, it was not marketed as one. It nicely hydrated my under eye area, making it healthier and much more easy to apply concealer over.</li>
    <li> It is too lightweight, maybe a little soothing.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price! Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This is great for short term use - very soft and fine textured.  BUT - it sinks in rapidly, so I use it during the day when I am out but not at night.  If used at night, it is absorbed so quickly that by morning it is gone and my eyes are dry.</li>
    <li> This is a very basic eye cream but when I had a terrible reaction to a retinol product I was using and broke out in a horrendous rash, I had to be careful about using skincare products.  This is wonderfully suited to sensitive skin (which apparently I&#x27;ve got now).  It won&#x27;t reverse the signs of aging and it&#x27;s not a heavy cream but it&#x27;s unscented and basic unfortunately is quite runny.  But I will be using it until my skin calms down.  Amazon&#x27;s price was a fraction of the drugstore price for some odd reason.  The product was unused and sealed and had no expiration date but it was unspoiled and in good condition.  It&#x27;s a large tube and since you only need a few dots, it will last quite a while.  I definitely recommend this for those with extremely sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it doesn&#x27;t contain any anit-aging ingredients and isn&#x27;t creamy enough to really have much of an impact on fine lines but is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> This product smells pretty darn good but for sure wakes my eyes up. Having to wake up early everyday is a pain, but what&#x27;s more painful is staying awake. Without a moring shower, I&#x27;m like a sleeping zombie, but with this I feel like an awoken zombie (yay), but seriously, this is amazing and definitely keeps your eyes from drooping back to sleep again. Reccommended to all &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this eye cream.  I am always on the lookout for new, cruelty-free products to try.  I was extremely impressed with how creamy and hydrating this balm was.  Because I have very oily skin I am always concerned about eye creams being greasy.  This one was not.  It gives the area under my eyes a nice dewy glow w/o being too shiney.  I am a licensed esthetician, so I have tried eye creams that ranged from $5-$100 over the years.  This one is just as effective and pleasant to use as an expensive one.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup except for a little concealer under my eyes, mascara and lip gloss.  I found that my concealer went on really smooth after applying this product, it did not cause my mascara to flake or smear and I also dab some on my lips under gloss or before I go to bed.  If you have dry skin around your eyes or are trying to prevent lines/help minimize existing lines, this cream is a great one to try.  It is like a drink of water for the delicate skin around the eyes.  I will definitely be ordering it again and have recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this works, but it feels nice and cool on my face when I apply in the mornings after working 13 hours.</li>
    <li> This productbis not harsh on my under eye area. It is not thick so I forget I am even wearing the product. Im in love with it!! It moustrizes well and hydrates my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different eye creams - and this one is the best by far. Soothing, seems to be reducing visible lines and puffiness, not oily and best of all - does not irritate my eyes. Very pleased with this product and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Something in the ingredients just didn&#x27;t agree with me. See pic</li>
    <li> it really does soothe my eyes love it</li>
    <li> Five stars for a great product.  It is nice and light with no noticeable scent.  I have been using for a month and have had no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> This made my eyes watery and itchy, I ended up having to throw it away!</li>
    <li> Great product, makes your eyes feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> When my allergies are really bad, I can&#x27;t really seem to use anything around my eyes without lots of eye watering...except for this eye cream. It is fairly moisturizing and soothing, and that&#x27;s about it. But, that&#x27;s all I really want it for, so I think it&#x27;s a pretty good eye cream for those who just want something gentle and basic.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use product that come in tubes, not jars, so this was ideal for me.  I use other Simple brand product and like them.  This eye balm goes on easily and does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s not anything out of the ordinary. It does what it says and moisturizes the eyes. Would I be faithful to it?...probably not.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time since you only need to use a little bit under each eye. It is soothing to tired eyes and provides refreshing moisture where you need it most. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This eye balm is very soothing on my tired allergic eyes. No perfumes or dyes &amp; hypoallergenic. Use it morning and night. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is  gentle on my eyes. I need something without a lot of harsh ingredients and this fits the bill. Love this product line and recommend it for others that have dry skin and need something soothing.</li>
    <li> As with many of my favorite products, the eye gel that I once used has gone missing. The reviews for &#x27;Simple Soothing Eye Balm&#x27; seemed to offer what I needed and that it did!. Allergies aplenty and this is perfect for cooling and soothing that irritated delicate, tissue around one&#x27;s eyes. Eye lids or underneath, this is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for taking the time to add your reviews, it does help one to decide what might be the best choice!</li>
    <li> I really like simple products, and this is no exception.  The price is good.  This is a thick eye cream which isn&#x27;t greasy and hydrates as well, or possibly better than more expensive brands (I usually use clinique eye cream).  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> A very light weight, almost greaseless formula that still makes your eyes feel moisturized without feeling greasy.  Hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, and does seem to help my skin.  I&#x27;m very happy with my experiment in buying something different for my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes,  this went on smooth and absorbs quickly, non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;no heavy smell...I would reccomend this product</li>
    <li> I like Simple brand but this eye product doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my eyes. Maybe it&#x27;s meant for skin that is not dry. ?</li>
    <li> Relax and enjoy a soothing eye balm. Helps to smooth and relax the skin in this very delicate area. A little dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! First time trying their eye cream and I like it. Seems to reduce the dark circles some and it&#x27;s light.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s just regular lotion.</li>
    <li> Does the job and DOES NOT sting my eyes, which just about every eye cream I have used does. Good buy for the price!</li>
    <li> As a man I never thought I&#x27;d use an eye balm.  But upon urging of my wife I tried it.  Excellent product.  Not greasy or oily.  Feels smooth upon application.  After a couple of months use, my wife sees a smoother and more vibrant skin and I agree with seeing a difference.  Well worth a try for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much more liquidy than I expected and there&#x27;s nothing really soothing about it.  All it does it make my undereye area greasy.</li>
    <li> After Origins changed their formulas or discontinued the products I used, I needed to find a replacement that was suitable for sensitive skin.  The “Simple” product line was the answer.  The Simple Foaming Cleanser, Simple Soothing Facial Toner, Simple Soothing Eye Balm, Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, Simple Soothing Facial Scrub are gentle, effective, and do not cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and I&#x27;m always looking for ways to hydrate my skin. Most eye creams I&#x27;ve used burn really bad. Some have even dried my under eye area completely out until the skin starts peeling. I&#x27;ve even had rashes. But this cream doesn&#x27;t have any side effects for me. It simply hydrates the areas around my eyes. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I liked Simple products but this one is not effective to my eyes. Not sure how well it works for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little skeptical about the benefits of using an eye cream in addition to facial moisturizers, so that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s insane when I see people spending ridiculous amounts of money for all of the eye creams out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this one is that a little goes a long way, there is no scent to cause any irritation, and I can have it auto-delivered by Amazon at an even lower cost than buying it anywhere else.  It goes on smoothly and after using it for about 7 days, I can say that the area around my eyes does not appear dried out or tired looking.  Perhaps the benefits will be even more so as I continue to use it, but so far I have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I found this product on a vacation in Ireland a couple of years ago. I have very sensitive skin, and I have tried just about every under eye product that exists. No matter what, I eventually get a rash under my eyes, so I end up with red blotches on top of my dark circles (not pretty). It does not matter how much I spend or how \\&quot;natural\\&quot; the product claims to be.   This is the first product I have ever found that helps moisturize the sensitive area around my eyes with no redness, irritation, or rash. My eyes do not burn, and my under eye area feels refreshed and the wrinkles and dryness are reduced. I cannot recommend this product enough for those who, like me, usually go without any product under their eyes because of sensitive skin. At this price (even some \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; eye creams can cost as much as $35!) this is a real deal.</li>
    <li> On a whim I purchased this eye cream and so far I&#x27;m impressed.  I use it along with my reg eye cream and I can see a subtle difference in my eye area.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. N the delivery was very fast.</li>
    <li> Works great love it. Soon I&#x27;ll get more.</li>
    <li> It is just okay eye cream. It is very light, but doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Highly moisturizing. You do not need a lot. Just a very small dot goes a long way!</li>
    <li> great stuff. has it been discontiued?</li>
    <li> Very soothing eye cream.  Light and non-greasy.  I use it often.  The provider mailed it promptly and was received in good condition.  I would recommend this provider.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to work well for me.  No miracles but it does the trick of moisturizing without being too oily.</li>
    <li> Gentle, so far so good. Been using it for about a week and i can see that is working. Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I use this on my eyes at night, it is missing an anti-wrinkle feature. It is great for sensitive eyes, but if you are looking for something to help with crow&#x27;s feet, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Really does the trick on puffy eyes.  Not just \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep\\&quot; puffiness either.  No, I got the flu nasal mist (never again) and it irritated something in my nose and the next day, my eyes started watering horribly.  Within 5 minutes, my eyes were all but swollen shut.  I dapped some of this one, and just as fast as the swelling came on, it went away.  Even my mother was impressed.  I&#x27;ve even dabbed a bit of it on the redness that is left after a pimple, and overnight the redness is gone.  It normally takes about a week without.  Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> My eyes are red around the outside and it seems to calm this issue.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have very very dry under eye area so i use this cream between daytime and nighttime skin care routine nor any of them. Love that this refreshes my skin so beautifully!</li>
    <li> This is one of the very few eye balm that give enough hydration and not irritating my eyes.  I use La Mer at night and use the Simple during the day.  Love it!</li>
    <li> the eye cream helps reduce the puffiness and swollen eye look...but i noticed that it somehow gets in my eyes during the day and that leaves the red,blurry,and a little burning</li>
    <li> I love love love this line!The packaging and shipments were great besides the box being crushed! The value is so worth it!</li>
    <li> light and very nice for eyelids</li>
    <li> This is an amazing eye moisturizer!  it&#x27;s so lightweight, but really moisturizing.  and the moisture lasts all day!  not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for the sensitive skin and the vitamin it contained is helpful to solve the problem of my skin.</li>
    <li> After using this product my skin still felt dry and it felt as if I hadn&#x27;t applied anything to it. I haven&#x27;t bought it again and won&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have dry or combination skin.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing. Was at least expecting a slight change.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eye skin like most eye products do, but it&#x27;s not super moisturizing. I was hoping for a nice thick moisturizing eye cream, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Product Description lists 9 ingredients; only 2 are the same as the 19 ingredients listed on the package. I applied the product several times, always with the same results: &amp;#60;5 minutes after application, the skin under my eyes was extremely dry – as if I had washed with a harsh soap and not applied any cream. I found this product drying, not hydrating or soothing. At $10 per 1/2 ounce, I expect more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year ago I switched from more expensive eye creams to Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Smoothing Eye Cream. I find it soothing and hydrating, softening the fine lines around my eyes. It contains cocoa butter, Vitamin E, peptides and retinol to soften skin and help prevent wrinkles. It&#x27;s only negative is a slight fragrance; while pleasant, I prefer to avoid dyes and artificial perfumes whenever possible, especially in skin care products. That is why I decided to try the Simple Soothing Eye Balm. For now I will continue using Palmer&#x27;s, while searching for an eye cream that is as effective but without dyes or fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful. When purchasing new products, I read and consider Amazon&#x27;s Customer Reviews. How this product received so many 4 and 5 star ratings is a mystery.</li>
    <li> This is great and effective for aging, sensitive eyes. I love all the Simple products that I have used to date.</li>
    <li> What a great idea making a short list of essential simple ingredients that include what&#x27;s needed and not a lot of other junk to irritate your eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, very soothing but too bad it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    <li> Meh. Feels about like rubbing aloe vera on your eyes. Even at this low cost I would say it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great. Shipped to me very quickly. I use it every morning and it definitely moisturizes the delicate under eye area. Also helps with dark circles and fine lines. I have eczema and very sensitive skin, and this cream is gentle and does not bother me. The price is also very good and reasonable through amazon, I paid more in the store for the same tube.</li>
    <li> This eye balm is light weight and soothing. It has a sort of cooling sensation when first applied. I have paid much more for similar products that I didn&#x27;t like nearly so well. It is hot and humid where I live now and I have no problem with this running  into my eyeas and causing discomfort. [[ASIN:B005TI7Q3C Simple Soothing Eye Balm, 0.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Nice eye balm. Not greasy, smelly or sticky. I also use above my upper lip. Pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! You can’t beat the price for this. It’s extremely moisturizing and soothing without being heavy or greasy. I use it every night and I can feel the difference it makes. Better than the Murad eye cream that costs upwards of $20.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say.  I had higher hopes for this balm.  I don&#x27;t have issues with wrinkles.  The skin under my eyes is dry, and I wanted something that would make them feel moisturized.  This product does make the skin under my eyes feel better for a while, but it seems to make it worse when I stop using it.  It&#x27;s not like a good foot lotion which will, over time, heal the skin if used properly.  With that said, I haven&#x27;t found anything better specifically for the skin under my eyes.  My dermatologist has said that it&#x27;s hard to find even prescription medications that are of much help.  I&#x27;ll likely buy it again.  It&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve found, and it does last a while if you use it as directed.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of lotion to cover the area.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and does seem to really relax and depuff.  Yay!  I have bought a lot of eye products that were high dollar that aren&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
    <li> For my skin type and concerns, this product hasn&#x27;t really done much for me.  On a positive note...it&#x27;s thin and it doesn&#x27;t get in to the eye.  I guess I was hoping for something more.  For the price, I would just use my regular face lotion instead.</li>
    <li> Works great and no irritation.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream for the price.  Does not have a scent or irritate your eyes.</li>
    <li> after the first application I felt relief from itching, burning, and didn&#x27;t feel the need to rub my eyes!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! So good for use under my eyes and with good ingredients as well. It revitalizes my eyes after a long night!</li>
    <li> This eye balm has a really nice, tingling sensation. It&#x27;s not overwhelming, but subtle and soothing. There isn&#x27;t any specific fragrance that I can detect. The texture is fine, perhaps a tad greasy, but really not bad at all. I would probably buy again.</li>
    <li> Amazon lists the ingredients with \\&quot;MINERAL OIL\\&quot; being the first ingredient. This is not true. The ingredients are as follows: Water (Aqua) , Glyceryl Stearate , PEG 100 Stearate , Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter , Panthenol , Tocopheryl Acetate , Bisabolol , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil , Sodium Hyaluronate , Cyclohexasiloxane , Chlorhexidine Digluconate , Laureth 7 , BHT , Phenoxyethanol. I thought I would clarify this as I have been using this balm for months, and when I saw that Amazon had mineral oil listed as the main ingredient, I had a mini heart attack because I do not like to use mineral oil on my skin (and was astonished that I thought I had been using mineral oil around my eyes for months without knowing it because I&#x27;m pretty big on ingredients in my skincare). Just so you know.. :) Also, in terms of rating this product, I gave it a 4. It is very moisturizing for my skin. I am 22 and using this as preventative care. Although this product doesn&#x27;t contain any distinguishable ingredients that specifically target aging, it is still a very good, light product that I enjoy putting around my eyes. They feel very hydrated when I use this balm, and I&#x27;ve grown to feel naked without using a moisturizing agent such as this around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and have noticed no changes in under eye puffiness or darkness. I think that any moisturizer would do the exact same thing as this product. Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. However, the effect wears off too quick. It has to be reapplied or supplemented with something else.</li>
    <li> I got to quit wasting my money on these so called beauty products</li>
    <li> Feels good going on but I don&#x27;t really feel any after effects.  It did sooth the existing tired feeling for the moment.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but it does its job just fine and moisturizes well without causing irritation.  I will probably purchase this again unless I decide to experiment with a new under eye cream.</li>
    <li> I love the Simple brand so I assumed I would like this product also. I didn&#x27;t. The texture was too runny and left me feeling dry under my eyes minutes later. I also felt a weird sensation on my skin the 4 times I tried this product. Sadly, I had to toss it. I think I need to stick to real eye creams instead of eye balms in the future. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a good one yet.</li>
    <li> Everything I&#x27;ve tried stings my eyes but not this one! It is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t sting at all! I feel like it helps to smooth the  wrinkles around my eyes too. I will definitely be buying this product again. Also when I ordered it they sent me the wrong product. I called and the woman was very accomodating and sent the right product out fast!</li>
