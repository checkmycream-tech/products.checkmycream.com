<li> That&#x27;s very disappointing when it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Eau de Parfum&amp;#34; and costs so much.</li>
<li> Very disappointed, never blind-buy fragrances, get samples first.</li>
<li> If I could I would have the company make a laundry detergent,dryer sheets,&amp; delicate wash to smell like this!!!!!MMMMMMM HEAVEN!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> I was highly optimistic about this scent after reading all the positive reviews but was so very disappointed when I received it.  It does not smell clean or fresh- it quite frankly smells like a deodorant feminine hygeine product.  I wish I could smell another bottle to see if I got a bad one, but no one sells it where I live.  Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> When I get out of the shower I love to smell &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;.  I use this along with the body wash and lotion afterwards.  And if I am going out later it doesnt Clash with my &amp;#34;going out perfume&amp;#34; that I will use.  I get alot of compliments on how good it smells.</li>
    <li> Received a little sample of this and am in love....glad I could get it thru Amazon...</li>
