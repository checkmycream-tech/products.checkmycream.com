      <li>Curlformers are amazing.</li>

      <li>I love curlformers.</li>
      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to hold a curl and these did the trick.  </li>
      <li>Better than a curler iron and more safe.</li>
      <li>I could have used about five more.</li>
      <li>I got so many compliments on my hairstyle every time I used them.</li>
      <li>i got so many compliments.</li>
      <li>I wish there were more than 6 in here.  </li>
      <li>Love these I just have to figure out how to keep my curls up</li>
      <li>When they came, I noticed that they looked more official than these.</li>
      <li>If I have to buy more I will purchase this brand.</li>
      <li>Air drying took more than an hour.</li>
      <li>Make sure to apply on damp hair after products are applied (leave in, mousse, etc).</li>

      <li>These were really easy to use and with two packs I was able to cover my head easy!  </li>
      <li>I have used them on relaxed hair, and they are great as I am transitioning to my naturally kinky hair.  </li>
      <li>then you know that it drys very quickly with out the crispyness, unlike styling gel or the \\&quot;brown\\&quot; protein gel.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are easy to go in, even for me.</li>
      <li>They are easy to come out.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>The upsides: they are easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This stuff isnt cheap, but it does work and it is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of them (which didn&#x27;t take me long), they are easy to use and produce reliably beautiful results.  </li>
      <li>The results: fantastic.  </li>
      <li>but they are not designed to be comfortable while doing so.    </li>
      <li>I purchased the off brand and they worked well, but the hook that came with those was so cheap it broke halfway through the process.  </li>
      <li>Although it is recommended that hair is clean.</li>
      <li>so that was a huge plus, that I could use them right out of the box.    </li>
      <li>Other than that they worked great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a costly investment, but one that I truely believe is worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently been interested in curling my hair, but since I&#x27;m fumble fingered, finding a good way to do it is the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so excited when i was first introduced to curl formers.</li>
      <li>Really liked them &amp; have recommeded to several friends already.</li>
      <li>irons and curling wands are right out.</li>
      <li>Curling irons have virtually no effect on my hair and foam rollers never come out looking right.</li>
      <li>do create beautiful, long, spiral curls that last all day.</li>
      <li>Keep a spray bottle handy for setting dry hair.</li>
      <li>But these actually do make perfect, natural-looking curls with very little effort.</li>
      <li>I imagine they will only get better with practice.      </li>
      <li>Although I haven&#x27;t found a method to up keep the curls w/o putting them back in the formers, I have to say that I love this product.</li>
      <li>(My first attempt to get consistent 3a hair.)</li>
      <li>Last but not least they weren&#x27;t very comfortable to sleep in.</li>
      <li>and then I want a really curly look.</li>
      <li>(Just don&#x27;t try to put too much hair in at once.)</li>
      <li>Everytime, without fail, they are perfect curls, and even the flawed ones look great.  </li>
      <li>so I couldn&#x27;t imagine sleeping with my whole head done.</li>
      <li>My hair is a bit beyond chin length with most of the length in the center.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to do a whole head</li>
      <li>However, i had to sacrifice the top part of my hair being curled because these were not long enough for my just longer than shoulder length hair.  </li>
      <li>If you can manage to sleep on them, you&#x27;ll wake up with some nice curls, which I prefer as second day hair when they&#x27;ve fallen and look more loose and less defined.</li>
      <li>and i will definitely continue to use these and try many different hairstyles.</li>
      <li>There should be 12 or 20 pks with no hook included for those who need just a few more.</li>
      <li>The price is a bit steep, but they definitely work and are worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will be purchasing the actually $60 kit soon worth the money</li>
      <li>I own long and wide</li>
      <li>They were not good curlers for me but you can try them at your own risk.</li>
      <li>and if you want a full look you definitely need to use smaller sections &#x3D;</li>
      <li>My goal is to avoid direct heat to minimize damage, and so I set these with damp hair, wrap foam (varying brands), and no frills aloe vera gel.  </li>
      <li>cause I&#x27;m a wild sleeper.</li>
      <li>only issue was with the instructions, they aren&#x27;t really very clear at all.</li>
      <li>I have long, thick, super straight hair.</li>
      <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars, is that it takes my hair so much longer to dry in these.</li>
      <li>Although in theory the product was genius - i slept in them with damp hair and awoke to curls that caused much less damage to my hair than blow drying and curling my hair with a hot curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair to my natural texture with out the big chop and the two very different textures</li>
      <li>of the things that I really didn&#x27;t like about it was that I bought two packs, due to another review saying that it was enough for their hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m learning to switch my look up a bit as far as pinning some of my hair back and curling only the back.</li>
      <li>I currently own the short and narrow (for the back and bangs) and long and narrow (for the body).</li>
      <li>I already had a set of long and narrow curlformers but needed just a few more to do my entire head.</li>
      <li>I myself have seriously fine and thin hair, but two packs was not enough for me.</li>

<li> If you have long hair you will need to invest in the pink and orange formers per your use (some even the yellow and pink).</li>
<li> I heeded two packages to do my whole head of thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have been using Curlformers for a few years and I am a big fan.  </li>
<li> If your hair is dripping wet</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the curlformers! Using these I had a great curly hairstyle. I got so many compliments on my hairstyle every time I used them. I recently cut my hair shore so I purchased the short ones. This is a staple item for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fumble fingered women with shoulder length hair that is either 2a to 3a, depending on the weather. I&#x27;ve recently been interested in curling my hair, but since I&#x27;m fumble fingered, finding a good way to do it is the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fragile, and prone to breakage since I got a perm last year. (My first attempt to get consistent 3a hair.) That was not a good choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curling irons and curling wands are right out. (Fumble fingered, remember?) Also, I&#x27;m afraid of burning myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curlers. Every once in a while, I&#x27;ll use some curlers that kind of \\&quot;velcro\\&quot; into my hair. They don&#x27;t need pins, but it takes too long to put into my hair on a daily basis. Also, getting them out means they pull on my fragile and breakage prone hair. Not what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across a review of these at naturallycurly.com and figured I&#x27;d try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to go in, even for me. (Just don&#x27;t try to put too much hair in at once.) They are easy to come out. They don&#x27;t pull on my hair, or hurt at any time during the process. (And I have to admit, I was worried about the giant crochet hook thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do create beautiful, long, spiral curls that last all day. (One of the only benefits of \\&quot;A\\&quot; type hair is that I do hold a curl well.) I heeded two packages to do my whole head of thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars, is that it takes my hair so much longer to dry in these. Air drying took more than an hour. Next I&#x27;ll try air drying my hair, and then just spraying it damp before using these.</li>
    <li> These are a really great investment if you have patience to put them in. The first time I used these, it took me nearly two hours and my hair is just a little past my shoulders. You have to take somewhat small sections of hair or it won&#x27;t even work, and the hook is completely necessary to have. A few of the reviews have said that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to do on yourself, which is untrue, it just takes a few times of actually using them to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the things that I really didn&#x27;t like about it was that I bought two packs, due to another review saying that it was enough for their hair. I myself have seriously fine and thin hair, but two packs was not enough for me. I could have used about five more. I also had problems with some of the ends of my hair sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides those few bad things, it&#x27;s really worth learning how to do it or finding a friend to help you. If you can manage to sleep on them, you&#x27;ll wake up with some nice curls, which I prefer as second day hair when they&#x27;ve fallen and look more loose and less defined.</li>
    <li> I am not a big \\&quot;beauty product\\&quot; gal - but every now and then I get a yen to change my look. So, I tried these curlers, to see if I could get nice, uniform curls.  The upsides: they are easy to use.  Again, not a big \\&quot;beauty product\\&quot; gal - so that was a huge plus, that I could use them right out of the box.    The downsides - if you have a tender scalp, beware.  You can really pull your hair without intending to, and once the curlers are in, they grab on tight and this can be uncomfortable (although not hideously so.)  Sleeping in them is also a problem - you can do it but they are not designed to be comfortable while doing so.    The results: fantastic.  I have only used them once but I was very pleased with the results.  I imagine they will only get better with practice.      I am hoping that someday someone will develop a product that doesn&#x27;t subscribe to the \\&quot;beauty is pain\\&quot; theory, but overall these curlers work as promised.</li>
    <li> I have been using Curlformers for a few years and I am a big fan.  Once you get the hang of them (which didn&#x27;t take me long), they are easy to use and produce reliably beautiful results.  I use them on wet hair with Motions Foaming Wrap Lotion and then sleep with them (which is admittedly uncomfortable, only downside), or sit under the dryer for less than an hour.  Lately I&#x27;ve been using Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel and that also works well.  Sleeping with a silk scarf across my pillow, I get decent curls for up to a week, freshening a few curls each morning with a curling iron.  I have used them on relaxed hair, and they are great as I am transitioning to my naturally kinky hair.  Did I mention that I LOVE CURLFORMERS?!?!</li>
    <li> Really liked them &amp; have recommeded to several friends already.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when i was first introduced to curl formers. I already had a set of long and narrow curlformers but needed just a few more to do my entire head. These things are like heaven for your hair. Perfect.....Im talking PERFECT curls. i got so many compliments. Everyone thought i got it done at a salon and it feels great say you did it yourself. Better than a curler iron and more safe. no hair damage and they last up to four days(if maintained). I have thick curly hair and i DID NOT have to straighten my hair for these to work and come out great. Although it is recommended that hair is clean. Great shine great texture overall satisfied and i will definitely continue to use these and try many different hairstyles.</li>
    <li> I love curlformers. I have relaxed hair and every now and then I want a really curly look. Although I haven&#x27;t found a method to up keep the curls w/o putting them back in the formers, I have to say that I love this product. PLEASE BUY ROLLERS FOR YOUR HAIR LENGTH! I can&#x27;t stress this enough. Long and narrow is for MEDIUM length hair which is the length of my hair at it&#x27;s longest point (at this moment in time). If you have long hair you will need to invest in the pink and orange formers per your use (some even the yellow and pink). I&#x27;ll admit sleeping in them is a hassle and if you want a full look you definitely need to use smaller sections &#x3D; more formers, however beauty doesn&#x27;t come w/o a price. I&#x27;m learning to switch my look up a bit as far as pinning some of my hair back and curling only the back. I&#x27;m going to try a spiral ponytail soon. Make sure to apply on damp hair after products are applied (leave in, mousse, etc). If your hair is dripping wet IT WILL RIP. Keep a spray bottle handy for setting dry hair. Otherwise it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I currently own the short and narrow (for the back and bangs) and long and narrow (for the body). I own long and wide but I use them very sparingly usually when I run out of my green and blue.</li>
    <li> Curlformers are amazing. I have long, thick, super straight hair. Curling irons have virtually no effect on my hair and foam rollers never come out looking right. But these actually do make perfect, natural-looking curls with very little effort. I&#x27;ve been sleeping on them, and yes, it is a little bit uncomfortable -- but definitely preferable to thirty minutes with a blow dryer. The price is a bit steep, but they definitely work and are worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue was with the instructions, they aren&#x27;t really very clear at all. I recommend you look up one of the instructional videos on Youtube before you start and save yourself a lot of tangles and grief.</li>
    <li> Although in theory the product was genius - i slept in them with damp hair and awoke to curls that caused much less damage to my hair than blow drying and curling my hair with a hot curling iron.  However, i had to sacrifice the top part of my hair being curled because these were not long enough for my just longer than shoulder length hair.  I purposely bought the products for long hair and they still were way too short.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Easy to use</li>
    <li> Love these I just have to figure out how to keep my curls up cause I&#x27;m a wild sleeper. Will be purchasing the actually $60 kit soon worth the money</li>
    <li> Bought these to go along with a starter pack.  I wish there were more than 6 in here.  There should be a 12 pack.  Other than that they worked great, it doesn&#x27;t come with a hook, which is also great because the starter pack gives you two hooks.  It would be a bit annoying to have a hook with each and every pack as I feel I needed two of these instead of one.  There should be 12 or 20 pks with no hook included for those who need just a few more.</li>
    <li> I bought these curlers and they were pretty useless!! After youtubing how to put them on I still had an issue at times with my hair getting tangled. Then although they were suppose to be for long hair they weren&#x27;t long enough for my hair (my hair is a little past my shoulders). Last but not least they weren&#x27;t very comfortable to sleep in. I only managed to put a few in my hair, and just those few we&#x27;re painful so I couldn&#x27;t imagine sleeping with my whole head done. They were not good curlers for me but you can try them at your own risk.</li>
    <li> It did not come with the stick thingy to pull the hair thru. It may have said it in description but I might have missed it, not sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to hold a curl and these did the trick.  These were really easy to use and with two packs I was able to cover my head easy!  My little girls look darling in these curls too.  I do have to say, they are a little tricky to sleep in, but we all know, beauty hurts. :)    Oh, and the trick to not letting them rip your scalp out is to unwind before you pull the curler out.  If you unwind, it won&#x27;t hurt.    I also uploaded a pic.</li>
    <li> Love love these, tried one other kind cheaper, but these are the best even if they ate more</li>
    <li> The product came without the hook needed in order to place the curlers in the hair; therefore, it is useless. My daughter can&#x27;t even use it. It is just a bunch plastic in a bag.</li>
    <li> These are great! My hair was too long for these so I bought the extra long version from the curlformers website. When they came, I noticed that they looked more official than these. These lack the curlformers logo melted into the rubber ends which makes me think that maybe they are not actual brand name curlformers. The paper on the packaging looked legit though so who knows. Curlformers are the best though!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big reviewer, in fact I hardly ever do it.  I absolutely love curlformers, the creator is a genius in my book.  I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair to my natural texture with out the big chop and the two very different textures would be a nightmare if I hadn&#x27;t heard about these on youtube. My hair is a bit beyond chin length with most of the length in the center.  My goal is to avoid direct heat to minimize damage, and so I set these with damp hair, wrap foam (varying brands), and no frills aloe vera gel.  If you have ever used aloe vera gel then you know that it drys very quickly with out the crispyness, unlike styling gel or the \\&quot;brown\\&quot; protein gel.  If I set them late at night then I use my hooded dryer for about 15-20 minutes to give the drying some help.  Otherwise I sleep on them as is.  Everytime, without fail, they are perfect curls, and even the flawed ones look great.  The curls last 2-3 days, but then I like to wash my hair atleast twice a week, so I haven&#x27;t tried to maintain for longer.  It&#x27;s a costly investment, but one that I truely believe is worth the money.</li>
    <li> wish they made them in black</li>
    <li> I would have given this a 4 if it came in a SET and were long enough to cover the hair.  This stuff isnt cheap, but it does work and it is easy to use.  I need about 11 packs it seems like to do my hair.  On the flip side, your hair will come out with nice curls.  I have yet to do a whole head so I dont know what to say about the end result :(.  Why would they make the big ones in a set and not the small ones?  I guess they are that pressed for sales.</li>
    <li> I purchased the off brand and they worked well, but the hook that came with those was so cheap it broke halfway through the process.  If you have the money I say go with this brand.  I use these along with the off brand.  If I have to buy more I will purchase this brand.</li>
