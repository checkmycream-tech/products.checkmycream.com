      <li>I will not repurchase for my hair, but may be a good option for wavy girls :)</li>
      <li>This product smells nice and all..</li>
      <li>This product was suggested to me by a friend, the smell is light and pleasant and the texture is not too watery.</li>
      <li>I knew it was the product because my hair was just as healthy as it could be.</li>
      <li>I like to layer it with my favorite hair butter.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I now use Organix nourishing coconut milk conditioner as a leave-in (which works a lot better with no build-up and controls frizz).</li>
      <li>My curls LOVE it.</li>
      <li>it did leave the top my head frizz</li>
      <li>love product</li>
      <li>The Curls Milkshake Light Curl Styling lotion was okay.</li>
      <li>GREAT product for my naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine wavy/curly hair</li>
      <li>but is too light for my 3b/3c curls.</li>
      <li>Curls Milkshake is light and provides ton of moisture.  </li>
      <li>okay at first i did not like this product.</li>
      <li>Also, if your significant others like the smell of coconut milk and almond milk, you will find them attempting to eat your hair.  </li>
      <li>, I really wanted to love this product because my hair was absolutely beautiful the first few days , I got so excited I even made a video and post it on Facebook telling people to try this product.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair that can frizz easily.  </li>
      <li>I feel that I did not get my money&#x27;s worth and</li>
      <li>Use the Curls Milkshake FIRST on damp, freshly washed hair.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair soft, with smooth curls.  </li>
      <li>now i think it left the top my head</li>
      <li>i did not put enough on the top.</li>
      <li>I have never used any curling prodcuts before and this was my first.</li>
      <li>Just tried it today for the first time.  </li>
      <li>First of all, none of the description or reviews inform you that this line of products (Curls) is for MULTI-ETHNIC women, and my review is one of a \\&quot;caucasian curly.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>On a positive note, it is non-greasy and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it</li>
      <li>When I use it alone I will have to lightly moisten my hair with water in my hands by scrunching and add champagne and caviar on the 3rd day.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery...</li>
      <li>It may or may not make a huge difference, and their website does mention that the consumer base includes more than multi-ethnic women, however, I might have liked to know that, as my hair isn&#x27;t really dry enough for me to notice that this product did a lot of good.    </li>
      <li>B001OOLOPQ Curls Milkshake Light Curl Styling Lotion, 8-Ounce Bottle]] left my curls really soft to the touch and</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for curly-heads that want smoother, softer curls.  </li>
      <li>mostly b with a little c.</li>
      <li>Giovanni organic hair care direct leave-in conditioner also works well but is much lighter.</li>
      <li>a few hours went by and the more my hair dried up the more</li>
      <li>then I can wet - or just dampen - my hair and apply the milkshake at any time and my curly natural hair is soft and frizz free all day!</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews for this product, I was very excited to use this product, however, I had to wait a very long time for it to actually arrive..    </li>
      <li>thats ok for me as long as my hair does not look dry and brittle.  </li>
      <li>Soft, moisturized hair with NO CRUNCH!</li>
      <li>I am trying a lot of new products when I am wearing my hair natural again.</li>
      <li>My current product is nice, but leaves my curls crunchy and hard and a bit frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really mind not having the pump, but for the sake of future purchasers, I figured I&#x27;d let people know that it may not have the pump.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been natural for three years,  </li>
      <li>I would probably use it again since I am trying to find out which products work for me and my natural hair.</li>
      <li>It is all natural plus it makesmy curls pop.</li>
      <li>First, a minor thing -</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about the smell.  </li>
      <li>The moisture factor for my 4a curls left much to be desired.</li>
      <li>This makes this product not worth the money because I use the whole bottle so fast for the price.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read carefully the first time around and used the curls quenched spray and then the milkshake.  </li>
      <li>From the other reviews, I expected better of this product (especially at that cost!)    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m natural and this stuff is one of the only moisturizers I buy.</li>
      <li>Another caution, don&#x27;t mess with it too much much once you put it on</li>

<li> A little goes a long way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the curl creams on the market with mixed results. One common thread was the crunchy hair. I hate crunchy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried the Curls souffle and milkshake. The souffle was okay, but the milkshake is just great. Soft, moisturized hair with NO CRUNCH! My hair is the healthiest it has been in years - I think that must be the coconut oil at work. I sometimes use the product with the Quenched Curls as recommended, but it works beautifully on its own. I wash my hair and put some shea butter in when it&#x27;s still damp then I can wet - or just dampen - my hair and apply the milkshake at any time and my curly natural hair is soft and frizz free all day!</li>
    <li> okay at first i did not like this product. i felt like it was a waste of money and i was upset!! a few hours went by and the more my hair dried up the more i loved the this suff.now it did leave the top my head frizz but every where else it looks GREAT!! now i think it left the top my head a little frizz becasue i did not put enough on the top. over all i love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine 3b curly hair and this is the BEST leave in conditioner I have ever found.  I use in conjunction with DevaCurl Angel.  Unlike other products, this doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed down or sticky.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave me with nasty build up.  Gone are the days of white flakes coming from my head due to product build up.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!!  Just tried it today for the first time.  I am a product junkie with dry, winter frizzy curls (type 3a/3b).  My current product is nice, but leaves my curls crunchy and hard and a bit frizzy.  And, while I love the control, I really hate crunchy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B001OOLOPQ Curls Milkshake Light Curl Styling Lotion, 8-Ounce Bottle]] left my curls really soft to the touch and NO FRIZZ!!!  One caveat:  I used the Curls Quenched with this product [[ASIN:B001OOLOP6 Curls Quenched Curls Daily Leave In Moisturizer, 8-Ounce Bottle]], and you have to follow the product label carefully.  Use the Curls Milkshake FIRST on damp, freshly washed hair.  Wait for a bit (about 10 minutes) THEN use the Curls Quenched spray and scrunch it in.  I didn&#x27;t read carefully the first time around and used the curls quenched spray and then the milkshake.  UGH.  I ended up with a foamy mess on my head, and ended up having to rinse it out and start over.  Another caution, don&#x27;t mess with it too much much once you put it on, just scrunch it in, then leave it alone.  Voila, wonderful curls with no frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for a product, but this one deserves it.  I have very curly hair that can frizz easily.  This product leaves my hair soft, with smooth curls.  I never go away without it.  It&#x27;s my one MUST HAVE for my hair.  I highly recommend it for curly-heads that want smoother, softer curls.  These products are for everyone, regardless of your background.  If you have curly hair, give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product smells nice and all..but is too light for my 3b/3c curls. I have to use a crap load just to feel like it&#x27;s doing something (and also everyday). This makes this product not worth the money because I use the whole bottle so fast for the price. I now use Organix nourishing coconut milk conditioner as a leave-in (which works a lot better with no build-up and controls frizz). Giovanni organic hair care direct leave-in conditioner also works well but is much lighter.</li>
    <li> GREAT product for my naturally curly hair. I use to for twist outs, bantu knots etc...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural and this stuff is one of the only moisturizers I buy. It is all natural plus it makesmy curls pop. Can&#x27;t beat it with a stick!</li>
    <li> I have 4a hair texture, my hair was very healthy, strong and beautiful. I saw this product and all the great reviews so I said I&#x27;d give it a try, I really wanted to love this product because my hair was absolutely beautiful the first few days , I got so excited I even made a video and post it on Facebook telling people to try this product. I used it for 1 week but then my hair started falling out in big pieces, I can just touch my hair and it falls off. I knew it was the product because my hair was just as healthy as it could be. i stopped using it for 1 weeks then tried it again just to make I was giving the product a fair chance. I hair became so weak and brittle it was just falling off. It&#x27;s just sad really cause I work so hard at retaining my length and now it&#x27;s just falling off.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I was very excited to use this product, however, I had to wait a very long time for it to actually arrive..    First of all, none of the description or reviews inform you that this line of products (Curls) is for MULTI-ETHNIC women, and my review is one of a \\&quot;caucasian curly.\\&quot; It may or may not make a huge difference, and their website does mention that the consumer base includes more than multi-ethnic women, however, I might have liked to know that, as my hair isn&#x27;t really dry enough for me to notice that this product did a lot of good.    This product worked just alright. It did not completely eliminate frizz and the smell was too over-powering for me. From the other reviews, I expected better of this product (especially at that cost!)    On a positive note, it is non-greasy and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it (and I usually need a ton of product for my very thick hair.) I will use it, it is good to nourish my hair with I suppose, but my hair needs more control than this product gives.     I feel that I did not get my money&#x27;s worth and I was disappointed. My quest for the perfect hair product goes on, as I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> First, a minor thing - the bottle I received did not have the pump dispenser shown in the image.  I don&#x27;t really mind not having the pump, but for the sake of future purchasers, I figured I&#x27;d let people know that it may not have the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, on to the review.  I have fine wavy/curly hair and I use this product as a leave-in conditioner and a curl revitalizer.  It works great for both, and oh, the smell..... It&#x27;s divinity.  If you like coconut milk and almond milk scents, you will feel like you&#x27;ve gone to heaven each time you use this.  Also, if your significant others like the smell of coconut milk and almond milk, you will find them attempting to eat your hair.  :)  I really can&#x27;t say enough about the smell.  I feel a little happier every time I use it.  Even if it didn&#x27;t help my curls, I&#x27;d probably continue using it just because it smells so dang yummy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing - this 8 oz bottle looks like it&#x27;s going to last me a LONG time.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am trying a lot of new products when I am wearing my hair natural again. The Curls Milkshake Light Curl Styling lotion was okay. I would probably use it again since I am trying to find out which products work for me and my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie!  I need to set up some meetings for myself because I try everything.  I have been natural for three years,  As my hair grows, it requires different products.  Curls Milkshake is light and provides ton of moisture.  I like to layer it with my favorite hair butter.  It does give some shrinkage but thats ok for me as long as my hair does not look dry and brittle.  I think every curly girl should have a bottle of this in thier repertoire.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Best to be used over a light leave in. Can be used alone, too. I have used it both ways. When I use it alone I will have to lightly moisten my hair with water in my hands by scrunching and add champagne and caviar on the 3rd day. I would say it is great for sealing moisture. I have type 3 curly hair...mostly b with a little c.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested to me by a friend, the smell is light and pleasant and the texture is not too watery. The moisture factor for my 4a curls left much to be desired. I got this on a sale so the cost wasnt an issue. I will not repurchase for my hair, but may be a good option for wavy girls :)</li>
    <li> My curls LOVE it. I have never used any curling prodcuts before and this was my first. It is great and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a cream before that had such a weird combination on my 3C curls. It would weigh my hair down. By the afternoon it felt oily. It didn&#x27;t do anything to eliminate frizz - I mean, I could have used no product and my hair would have been just as frizzy. Altogether a gross look for me.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Perfect weight and texture to help with nurturing your curls. The fragrance is divine and the outcome will not be disappointing .</li>
    <li> These products are the only thing that has ever worked for the texture hair that I have. Would recommend to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery...love product</li>
</ol>
