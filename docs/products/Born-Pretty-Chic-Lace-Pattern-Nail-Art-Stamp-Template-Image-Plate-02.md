      <li>Beautiful lace designs make it easy to stamp your nails at home so many different ways.  </li>
      <li>Seller is soooo great to do business with..plate stamps clean and clear....</li>
      <li>Fast shipping will be buying more!</li>
      <li>I enjoy using these nail art stamps.</li>
      <li>It is worth the effort!  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I loved this plate!</li>
      <li>But that is true of almost any &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;border&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Now, a quick word about the lace edges on this plate.  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>Every intricate detail is crisp and well balanced, no thinning images here!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun</li>
      <li>I have purchased Born Pretty products (directly from site) and have always been pleased with their products.</li>
      <li>Love this cute little stamper!</li>
      <li>Shipped pretty fast!</li>
      <li>These types of plates with borders do make them pretty close together, so it is an issue I&#x27;ve learned to compensate for in order to get pretty borders on my nails.  </li>
      <li>As an avid stamper I purchase many different brands of stamping plates.</li>
      <li>but if your looking for extra discs these ones are lovely 😃</li>
      <li>I will need to hone my skills and color choices so the images show up better, but overall.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be purchasing more from this brand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first experience with them</li>
      <li>Thanks!)</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>So far, I coupled the &amp;#34;lace&amp;#34; edge with the flower patter of plate 17 and made a really pretty diagonal tip that looked like lace on my nail.  </li>
      <li>They came fast and cute little sleeves which I lovedx will buy from them again.</li>
      <li>Came early!</li>
      <li>It arrived far ahead of the estimated delivery date.</li>
      <li>Old school feel.</li>
      <li>The design is not wide, and the polish does tend to get onto the adjacent border image, necessitating your rubbing off the excess from your stamp before applying to the nail.  </li>
      <li>Came really fast, weeks before I expected.  </li>

Every intricate detail is crisp and well balanced, no thinning images here! I am very happy and highly recommend those Born Pretty plates to any discerning nail art enthusiast!</li>
    <li> Really great plate.  Came really fast, weeks before I expected.  So far, I coupled the &amp;#34;lace&amp;#34; edge with the flower patter of plate 17 and made a really pretty diagonal tip that looked like lace on my nail.  [I&#x27;ll try to post a photo later].  Now, a quick word about the lace edges on this plate.  I must admit that it took multiple tries to always pick up the border image.  The design is not wide, and the polish does tend to get onto the adjacent border image, necessitating your rubbing off the excess from your stamp before applying to the nail.
