<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent shadows, great variety. Some of them may look like they are the same colors but they are not, they are all different and they are a good size with alot of powder! Will be ordering again. I use a base on my eyelids to really make the color pop but they can be used without a primer</li>
    <li> I had expected to receive bright colors: blue, yellow, green, purple, red. Instead, every color is a pastel shade. Plus, there are at least 4 golds and 3 silvers. This is fine, but I would have rather had fewer silver and gold and more bright colors. If I had known it would all be pastel colors, I would never have bought it. This was a gift for my teenage daughter and, although she likes many of the colors, the reason we bought it was for the brighter shades. Value wise, there is a lot for the money, but I feel the colors in the photo are very misleading. The description should say &amp;#34;colors may or may not be contained in kit&amp;#34;. If you want 40 pastel shades, go for it. If you want even one red (of which there is none), don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> is wonderful, the colors are so nice, incredible is my shadow prefer</li>
    <li> I just received my eyeshadow set! Let me start of by saying that it is perfectly packaged in a neat black box, when I opened it all the shadows were neat and in place. When I opened one of the shadows up and tryed it the color was beautiful ans vibrant and very shimmery !!!! If you want lots of sparkle I would define till recommend getting this kit. I&#x27;m taking it to vegas so I can look sparkly every day!</li>
    <li> Im in love with this product. Best make up purchase from Amazon yet.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing all the great reviews and overall the product was ok i received this product very quick which I always do with all my shany products I was kind of disappointed when I started to look at the colors because I didn&#x27;t feel like they reflect the colors in the pictures or even the box some of the colors looked the same to me I noticed from reading a lot of other peoples reviews this was a problem for them as well but on a positive for less than 50 u get all these great eyeshadows so I would recommend buying this just don&#x27;t expect all the great colors you see in the pictures</li>
    <li> This set is worth hundreds if bought individually. The jars are double the size of the average jar. The pigments can be used to mix with nail polish, lip gloss, white/clear base mascara color, body shimmer as well as wet or dry. The metallics are very intense.</li>
    <li> OMG! I brought this as graduation gift for my self ( s/o to class of 2012! ) AND I love it so much! Some colors do look the same but I swear they are not!. Its proven to be very useful and it doesnt sweat off! I went to a party and did my glam style make up ( super heavy/glittery) and I was to tired to wash my make up off when I got home.(GROSS). But the next morning my make up was still in place looking amazing! This is a great gift to give anyone or just to have yourself! I will be ordering more products . The one downside I do have is that the glittery pigments get kind of itchy on the eyelid. That may just be , because of my sensitive skin! IDK nor do I CARE I love this product btw.... follow me on twitter @viva_de_glam</li>
    <li> Very nice just as described.</li>
    <li> Really great colors. I usually use MAC pigments. I was truly surprised how lightweight the Shany pigments are. Not even heavy at all.  I will recommend this set to any who love cosmetics.  #reviews@ShanyCosmetics</li>
    <li> Wow!!! All I can say is wow!! I compared this beautiful white opalestant color next to my MAC brand loose shadow. I like this better !!  I did think I got a few of the same colors nope absolutely not. The corals and oranges look the same but they most definitely are not. Wow these are extremely pigmented Beautiful easy to work with eyeshadows. Its great because you have a few fun colors for the weekend and the glitters!But you have enough colors to wear every day. I am in love with the mint green one. It&#x27;s Beautiful and my eyes are a Blue green. It just makes them pop. That&#x27;s all have to use a little of the mint green and I love the white. I love the kawaii look as well. A wash of white with a wash this pink in here perfect On your eyes. Seriously you can get any look with adding these shimmers. I love glitter so it will get used on the weekends. There are only about 6 in your kit Maybe two more. If you don&#x27;t like glitter give them to your little girl or use them for crafts. They are so fine milled I love them. As for these beautiful deeply pigmented colors with staying power. These stay on all day!! Ladies always use an eye shadow primer. It is a must!! I got this kit for 20 some dollars with a coupon. In my opinion it is definitely worth the money or more actually...I did compare them to MACS Loose powder shadows!!! I do believe that I know what I am talking about with these beautiful fine milled highly pigmented shadows. I was a make up artist for a high end company!! So every day of my life for years not only did my make up have to be perfect but everyone else&#x27;s too that came into the high end store to buy the high end make up. I am a stay at home Mom. I still get dressed every day. Oh I did fall asleep with these one and I woke up with the shadow still on just lighter!! Thats staying power. I am so impressed with these beautiful colors. They look great on in my train case and on my face. One of my girl friends always goes through my stuff lol and she said whendid you start buying this brand ??? I never heard of it!! Then I hear were did you get these ...these colors are beautiful and so many. I told her so Shanty you have another order. Great quality great shipping. The company has offers for you as well after you buy. Thats so nice and important. I really want to try there lip glosses. I am a lip glossaholic so I took a chance on these shadows did not go to MAC store so now I will try the lip glosses to see how they do. Thank you Shanty for this beautiful kit that I adore!! Oh also these came in a beautiful box that u could store them in. Each one was labeled on the bottom with the number so when you run out of the color you know which one to order. They were also sealed very very well. If you love smoky eyes dramatic eyes just a slight wash of color on your lid...this kit works for all your needs. Oh the two brushes were excellent!! Great quality As well. I used the end to draw a fine line under my eye and perfect line!! I can&#x27;t say enough about these obviously. Take a chance you wont be sorry!! Have fun with your new kit. Dont be afraid to be bold no matter what your age. I am 41 and this kit works for me. I never thought I would love orange shadow but when blended with gold oh how beautiful!! I never would have picked out an orange shadow and now I am so glad I have one!! Its a beautiful shimmering orange. I have my fave every day ones And love that I have some bold colors for the weekend. I am just thrilled with these!! Also these pots are big!! These will last a while. Oh if you are new to using loose shadow. Do your eyes first then the rest of your make up. I say to do this because if you accidentally get some loose pigment shadow on your face you can just wipe it off with a make up remover cloth. Then you wont ruin the rest of your make up :-). Thank you Shanty for this beautiful kit. It exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> sooo worth it and amazing colors 10X10!!!!</li>
    <li> Such a great deal! You don&#x27;t get all of the colors shown in the photo, but I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the product it self.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors and it came very well packaged!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!arrived on time and colors are very pigmented</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter and her friends loved this so much we are going to order another set.  My daughter said she wishes it had more purple so hopefully the next set will have a few more purples.  Love how it looks wet too!</li>
    <li> I got these on a whim and I love them only down fall is that the sifter for the powder to come out is to large of holes and so you get alot of powder instead of just a bit making you super shiney.</li>
    <li> There are some bright colors in this set. I just wish there was less orange and more purple and pink. Each bottle is a nice size so you&#x27;re getting your monies worth.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, the mineral wear, there are so many assortments in the package and I love all of the different colors it binds well with my primer.</li>
    <li> This colors in this set are so brilliant and vibrant. They are WORTH the money. And the brushes are so cute. They&#x27;re perfect, I&#x27;m glad it comes with two because I&#x27;m pretty bad with my eye shadow and liner brushes... haha</li>
    <li> This set is so nice. I just love looking at them in my makeup display. They are around the same quality as the TKB pigments, except these are cheaper. Its good to use these wet for optimal color payoff but I also use them dry to blend out the edges of my look. Be careful to store them somewhere where they can¡¦t be broken because they do sometimes crack ¼</li>
    <li> Great price and a great product!  I use these everyday and get tons of complements. Came in nice packaging and all were individually sealed, so no product was lost.</li>
    <li> Love love love this set. It arrived in perfect condition. The colors are fantastic. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Plus-- I saved a ton buying on AMAZON! You wont be sorry. The product is easy to use. If you have any trouble consult YOUTUBE as they have tons of videos on this particular set. It&#x27;s fabulous! No regrets on this one other than I waited to long to buy :)</li>
    <li> its good because it is a lot of product, is very pretty ...however if u are expecting actual glitters... then don&#x27;t buy it. it is shimmery eyeshaddows and is very good for professional makeup artists.... also a primer is needed for the shimmer to stick to the lids</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this purchase! There is a great variety, here and the colors are bright. I have used them with and without primer and both ways, the colors show up well and stay on all day! I will definitely be getting more products from Shany Cosmetics!</li>
    <li> if you are obsessed with glitter or loose pigments like i am, then this is heaven for you. You get so many different colors for a great price, I am in love with every color in this set because the colors are so vivid and bright its so great for summer when i just wear it as eyeliner, I am in love with this (:</li>
    <li> I cant believe the price of this eye shadow! You get so much for so little and it really is better quality than that of the company that we always compare to. Just a tip: Mist your brush with make up setter before you dip your brush into the pigment it will reduce the amount of fall off an will make it appear more vibrant</li>
    <li> I love loose eye shadows and glitters and these do not disappoint. I also think it&#x27;s great that the two brushes are included, as well.</li>
    <li> These pigments are a great way to experiment and even make your own eye shadow colors! With the variety of colors you can&#x27;t go wrong with these. Be more creative with your makeup routine. Match your clothes. Shine!</li>
    <li> The colors are extremely bright and work really well! They are so sparkly and pretty, and there isn&#x27;t a color you cant have by combining them</li>
    <li> Wow! Were do I start. Divas it a must! Pigments are extremely High Quality and LONG lasting. You can use for regular use but if you do photoshoots THIS IS A MUST! The color are Rich! The glitter are great to. But im more of a fan of the rich Pigments.</li>
    <li> Great pigments! Nice, deep rich colors as long as water is applied, but it doesn&#x27;t need much. The sheer ones though need a lot of layering to get to work. I stay away from the sparkle one&#x27;s because I have yet to successfully place them, but the price is still worth all the other ones that work.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and has many bright colors to choose from.  I have had a lot of women ask what kind of eye shadow I was wearing and even to do a make over on them.  I am not a make up artist just someone who loves make up.</li>
    <li> Very shimmery... I love the colors!!! Plus its a good price for just 40 loose eyeshadows. I recommend this for you ladies.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this as it is hard to tell from a picture if the colors are something you might like but much to my surprise I love this set and would say that if you want to have alot of different colors then you will like this set. It comes in a nice box and the brushes it comes with are nice. I am happy I bought this and would say give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my sister and she hated it and laughed when she got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality was poor but the brushes are good</li>
    <li> 2-3 colors families look exactly a like throughout this set</li>
    <li> nt as pigmented as expectbut still good if you use primer</li>
    <li> Just received my beautiful pigments and this was a great purchase. I absolutely love the colors and can&#x27;t wait to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this buying experience!</li>
    <li> They are ok for foiling eyeshadow but not usable alone.  Most of the colors repeated 3 times.  It was great for my clients that wanted a heavy shimmer as I could only foil it.</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t wet my brush to apply then it seems more glitter than any color. It is hard to blend but once the final art design is done it still looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I just got this last night and I love it! Looks just like the pictures colors and all. I am going to start using them today. I can&#x27;t wait!!!!</li>
    <li> A few years ago i gave up on eye shadow completely no matter what i did it always stuck in the creases I was given this product as a gift and now I cant get enough ... I love this product it stays on well and looks great ... A few of the colors are similar but if you know your colors you can tell the different undertones ... Its great for any outfit you can imagine :)</li>
    <li> Overall, this is an excellent deal for mineral makeup.  That being said, I am a little disappointed in the colors received since I seemed to get more yellow and orange shades than expected.  I received no greys or blacks, and only one purple.  I am happy with the neutral colors, pinks, blues, and two green I received though. I still gave four stars because you can&#x27;t beat the cost.</li>
    <li> For what your getting for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. I just have share time getting the powder out of the container. I have to bang a few times. However, it is nice to have a selection to choose from.</li>
    <li> ive had these for awhile but recently started playing around with them...theyre awesome for creating looks with just about every color but if youre looking for super intense color they probably wont live up to expectations. aside from that, i would definitely buy them again because for the amount of money spent it is worth every penny because they have lasted and they give you a lot in every container.</li>
    <li> Love it I will buy it again.I would suggest this to anyone.I&#x27;m going to buy another one and use it on my clients.</li>
    <li> Keep in mind that these colors do change every year. If you order two you will get the same exact colors in each one, but each year they come out with a new one. I wish they had a black or two in it but for the price and amount of color you get it can&#x27;t be beat. There are some duplicates which I was a little irritated with. The quality of the shadows are fantastic. Mix them with a bit of water for more pigment. The set I got was ALL glitter. NO matte colors at all. I am really hoping Shany comes out with a set that is matte. I would order that in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my makeup!  Excellent quality and the shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I purchased this item. It came with all the colors shown in the picture and it is just perfect. I already tried using one last weekend and I just love everything about it. I&#x27;m an inspired cosmetologist so i cannot wait to play with all of these colors and try all different thing. I was really skeptical about ordering this from looking at some of reviews but i was very happy that I went with my gut and it came in perfectly. From the packaging to the colors. Nothing was spilled or opened. And being overseas I got it in a matter of a week. I would def recommend this to any one!! Click the ADD TO CART BUTTON now!!!!</li>
    <li> The colors are very pigmented and beautiful! It is very fun to mix the colors to get a very nice shade! Perfect to play around with!</li>
    <li> 40 pcs with two free brush for the price? I think that is so cheap since the eyeshadow quality are amazing! I got this as a gift for my early birthday and I have to admit, I am in love with all the eyeshadow because of the beautiful colors and the quality! The brush itself is amazing because it is so soft and makes the eyeshadow applies on beautifully.</li>
    <li> If you love pigments, these are for you.  These are affordable pigments that comes in a variety of colors.  You will never need to buy any more pigment after you buy this set.  The color are pigmented and very bright and vibrant.</li>
    <li> Wow, amazing selection! Like any pigments, you&#x27;ll want to use a primer or glitter glue underneath. Some of the colors look very similar and I wish there was a black! But for this price, I won&#x27;t complain too much :)</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought it today! I see its cheaper but I still got a great deal thank God! lol its worth it too. This is my Christmas present to my self. I always wanted this and now I got it. Nice size for each Color individually. Great colors too.</li>
    <li> I love the pigment of this eye shadow and it goes on so smoothly. I will buy this again when I run out. Love this companies product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this set of eye shadows! They are vibrant and shimmery and I did not see any duplicate shades, which I was worried about based on another buyer&#x27;s comments. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Came quickly and exactly like it stated it would come. Great quality product for sure!</li>
    <li> The pigments are bright and last all day/night especially when used on primed lids.  Loving the different combinations I have created so far.  I get so many compliments on my makeup.  Will definitely buy more products from Shany!</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed in these eye shadows.  The consistency and coloring of each shadow is different for every container.  For a lot of the eyeshadows it seems like the color and glitter look disappears almost completely even if you&#x27;re using a lot.  Also when using a lot, the glitter tends to run down your face as the day progresses, so you look like you&#x27;re crying glitter.  On a separate note, the bright orange shadow made me look like an alien.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Pretty expensive product for what it turned out to be, I would have been better off buying individual eye shadows with glitter already in it...that way I would have only the colors I want.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this as it is hard to tell from a picture if the colors are something you might like but much to my surprise I love this set and would say that if you want to have alot of different colors then you will like this set. It comes in a nice box and the brushes it comes with are nice. I am happy I bought this and would say give it a try.</li>
    <li> awful quality and disgusting colors!!! nothing but glitter!!</li>
    <li> Seriously the best make up I&#x27;ve ever bought! I won&#x27;t use any other makeup since I&#x27;ve gotten this set! Shany is amazing, well worth your money(:</li>
    <li> Was not as pictured.  Did not receive any reds and only one purple.  I can work with what I got, but definitely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recently was on vacation and purchased 4 mineral based eyeshadows from a high end boutique!  I paid $45.00 for ONLY 4 colors because I was impressed with all the stuff you could do with it!  So i decided to search for a lower cost item and found it here on amazon!  I purchased this 40 shadow kit and I feel like a kid in a candy shop!  Let me tell you... with this product you not only have eye shadow, you have lip shades, nail polish, eyeliner, mascara, and blush!  You never have to search for that perfect shade of lipstick or nail polish to match your eyes again!  You take plain lip gloss and mix a little color of whatever shadow and you have a perfect lip gloss!  Same with nail polish... pour a little bit (and really a little goes a long way with this) of shadow on a cleanable surface/pallet and take clear nail polish to it.... then paint your nails!!!  for eye liner... put some powder on the back of your hand and put s liner brush in a bit of water (do not soak) then rub in powder and line your lid!!!  its awesome, affordable, and fab!!  does not sweat off or crease either!</li>
    <li> Amazing variety of pigmented eye shadows! plus two free brush with the set of 40 shadows! great deal : )</li>
    <li> The color is really pretty and pigmented. The texture is finely milled and super fine like they said in the description which is true. And it comes with 2 free eye shadow brush ! :)</li>
    <li> Why buy a MAC pigment when you can get a much more affordable set from Shany, with equal quality. The brushes are perfect for packing on the pigment for a vibrant burst of color! Not only can these be used for shadows, but you can also use some of the colors for blushes! The pigments can also be mixed with clear gloss for great lip colors (you can use more than just one to mix, for a custom color!) They are super shimmery, and so beautiful anywhere on the face! I also love using them as liners, you can create such fun, colorful looks! I love love LOVE these pigments!</li>
    <li> JUST GOT MINE YESTERDAY IN THE MAIL, I LOVE ITTTTT&lt;br /&gt;GREAT QUALITY, GREAT COLORS, I LOVE IT &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BUY !!</li>
    <li> These eye shadows are very much worth the buy. I had originally seen these eye shadows in a make up tutorial and thought they were vibrant. I did go to the Shany website but they were all sold out of this product so I decided to check here. As I read the reviews I noticed that a few buyers complained about the colors they had received so I was a little nervous. The shipping was on time which was two days and the item was packaged nicely. The colors are just as they seem in the photos posted on the page. At first glance the colors seems as if you have multiples of the same color but if you look closely they are not. One of the photos shows the colors in numerical order in which they are shipped. They do not have names for the colors but they do have a stickers on the bottom with numbers. That&#x27;s how I checked to make sure I was getting different colors and not the same. I found it strange that a lot of people had that problem when in fact they are all different. If you were to also take a picture with your camera the colors shows in the photo as being different.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with the size of the containers these eye shadow come in. You are getting a lot of looses powder for a great price. The quality is also amazing. These colors are not matte. They are all shimmery and a few that seem more glittery. I would recommend this product to beginners and professionals.</li>
    <li> I have this 40pc set and I find that if applied wet, the colors reeeeally POP!  just ordered a bunch of other products yesterday..... ORDER FROM SHANYCOSMETICS.COM they are cheaper and with free shipping and samples with orders over $50 and they&#x27;ve got a great sale going on for the holidays :)</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying Shany cosmetics and I really time it, really nice colors and very pigmented. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love all these color eye shadows and they are very pigmented. I&#x27;m so glad that I ran across these because they will last me a very long time it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to go through them like that but I thought that it was a great price for these and it&#x27;s also a great product from Shany, they have other make-up products out as well and I will be looking into getting more of their products pretty soon. I love the colors and they are so vibrant so I love vibrant colors when I&#x27;m feeling spunky and want to be different but other than that I can&#x27;t complain about it because I bought it and I love it and I love how it looks on my eyes when I put it on! I will be referring some friends to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for the price. A large range of glittery colors and comes with two brushes. These are a fine and not chunky glitter and beautiful.</li>
    <li> this was wayyyy above what I expected! absolutely loved it and it had every single color in it! I was just absolutely satisfied with it</li>
    <li> very pigmented, i love the loose pearl shadows and i love the glitter on them makes my eyes pop! so many colors they are amazingggg! i can&#x27;t say it enough its a must have!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say about these pigments! These are truly amazing. There are so many colors and so many ways to use these. The brushes that come with it are so awesome too. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about these pigments at all.</li>
    <li> Some of the reviews stated they got several shades of whites, and no bright colors, but my set game with vibrant oranges, blues,reds, yellows, and greens, along with browns, pinks, purples, ect.  great deal, especially for the price.  plus the containers are pretty big for loose powder, and filled to the top.</li>
    <li> these are so versatile..great quality and amazing deal</li>
    <li> Ugh, gorgeous!! These pigments are amazing. So many colors, and hugeeee color payoff. The brushes that come with the kit are amazing as well. And at that price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for glitter eye shadows and I prefer loose over pressed any day! This set is AWESOME for creating fun, bright looks that are really \\&quot;eye catching\\&quot;.  Plus it includes two brushes!</li>
    <li> Ok first of all.. ORDER FROM SHANYCOSMETICS.COM they are cheaper and with free shipping and samples with orders over $50. Sure it doesn&#x27;t have all the colors that appear on the image however it has I think abut 25 or so colors. They are super pigmented and there is a lot of powder so definitely they will last a really long time. I truly love it. Even with repeated shades if you really want one specific color you can buy it separately from another place. Another thing, even though many of the colors of the same there is a difference in the amount of glitter they have. For example you may have 2 yellows of the same color but one will be more glittery than the other.</li>
    <li> I found a good quality product, I was pleased.</li>
    <li> Though I don&#x27;t have this product, I really like the look of it.  I also LOVE eyeshadow, along with shimmery eyes.  I spend a lot of time every day trying to create the perfect \\&quot;look\\&quot; with eyeshadow, and do believe that this \\&quot;look\\&quot; would be attainable with this set of eyeshadow, because, morning, noon, or night, what people notice on a girl, is her eyes.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Beautiful color and excellent quality</li>
    <li> FAST DELIVERY, GREAT COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM AND TWO NICE BRUSHES THAT I WAS NOT EXPECTING.  WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE BROWN NATURAL COLORS.</li>
    <li> This set of shimmery pearl touched mineral shadows adds fun to any look.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit put off by the number of similar shades but I have found them to have a wider  range of colors than I initially thought. When placing these on the skin slight color variations that can be seen in the seen in the jar take on a new depth and the color changes dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;You will want to take a few days to sit back and play with the set to find your favorites. Some have larger bits of glitter than others but all have some shimmer to them. Don&#x27;t let that stop you from trying these! The colors look amazing on the skin and the color payoff is awesome too. A little goes a long way but you get more than a little of each color. A full 40 jars of shadows, yes forty, are included in the set in a beautiful display box with a plastic tray that holds the jars neatly in the box. These are not sample size jars, they hold quite a bit of product in each of the jars. For the price you cannot beat these!</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the intentions that I was getting 40 different colors, im looking through these and i have 5 colors that have been repeated twice I have two number 02, 24, 05, 12 and 38 I&#x27;m annoyed!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these shadows!I have some micabella mineral shadows also but the colors of these are great looking.some people commented that they had a problem with the wear of the shadows but I have not. Wish they would come out with an time set.</li>
    <li> despite what the pictures show and the description says,  there were absoloutely no kind of any kind of reds in there at all nor any light red regular red or dark red and/or burgundy, no kind of any kind of red you can think of whatsoever in there, secondly about 4 or 5 of the colors in there were like a white/cream,--- all look the same; thirdly  where it says in the description \\&quot;there are all shades of green\\&quot;- there was only one shade of green in mine.  their description- \\&quot;assorted among the following colors: Soft white- (i got about 5, they really look the same,), honeysuckle, sunshine, lollipop, radiant, and black pearl- (no black in mine either \\&quot;sunshine\\&quot;..)gold, nude pearl, all shades of green  (huh, only got one.), blue, purple, red (..you would think with all those beautiful reds in the pictures&#x3D; zip, zilch, nada..), pink, and etc. Please check picture for more details. (maybe, just check my description after-all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three out of 5 cuz I can still work with what I got, hope this works for somebody that needs some truth.  And about 5 of them were like a peachy/coral color which all looked, about the same as well.  Similar to the creams/whites I talked about earlier.  im guessing they ran out of the reds and the greens they were talking about.  and gave me a bunch of creams and corals, but i wil use what i got to get what i want, and am gonna use it to the best of my ability, which i hope comes out superb and marvelous.</li>
    <li> Perfect shades very vibrant and sparkling they also last all day and then some I love playing with the many different colors!! So worth the money spent</li>
    <li> I was so surprised on how pigmented the eyeshadows were! When I applied it on my lids it was absolutely gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This is the best loose mineral shadow on the market....I would even say it is better than the other name brand ones that sell for a ridiculously high price for 1. These are EXCELLENT quality and an amazing array of colors....all that are wearable. Purchase this NOW...you will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I was so surprised on how pigmented the eyeshadows were! When I applied it on my eye lids it was absolutely gorgeous! and 40 of em for $45?!!! that&#x27;s insane, but incredibly awesome!!</li>
    <li> These pigments are so pretty, they can do anything you want them to and you can expect the colors to just absolutely pop. I love them, they are gorgeous.!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic collection of eye shadow with shimmer and shine, just enough glitz not to be garish. They are trendy and chic. Their application is so smooth and I can regulate the degree of color by the amount of pressure I apply. Considering the cost of buying a single item similar to these, it is very reasonably priced - a fraction of the cost. I love them! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I debated on ordering these... the size?? the color?? would I like them?? Well let me tell you the size is about 1oz. each and the colors AWESOME not super brilliant just right... and I LOVE THEM!!!! I only wish they sold singles now to replace the ones I am going to use up :) maybe by the time they run out they will be selling them individually. :) I must say i looked at these for the longest time and just could not justify the money but i am glad I finally ordered them .... YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are great, lots of pretty colors to enjoy!  I&#x27;m having lots of fun with them...The brushes work very well too.</li>
    <li> I loved this purchase some of the colors are bright and then you have those you can wear any time. Great set!!</li>
    <li> OMG These pigments are AMAZING definitely worth super worth their prize, long lasting, super pigmented, and a lot comes in the bottle. I loved them!</li>
    <li> The colors arent as vibrant as I wouldve wanted, but they still show up very well.  And don&#x27;t get confused like me every single color contains glitter.  I thought just a few of them would but they all do.  It would be great it some of the shadows didnt contain the glitter.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to try a new brand, but WOW the eye liner, powder and shadow are all amazing. They stay on and are such vibrant/sharp colors. SHANY is my new make up line!</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have shimmery and glittery eyeshadow in nearly every color in the rainbow and MORE!!! This is a GREAT DEAL. I&#x27;m won&#x27;t need to buy eyeshadow for years!</li>
    <li> i love the loose eyeshadows -- I&#x27;m a makeup artist and it works out so well for pictures because the pigments come out much better than regular shadows</li>
    <li> YOU DON&#x27;T EVEN NEED A BUNCH TO GET AN AMAZING EFFECT!!!! I literally only put enough for the tip of the brush and applied to almost my entire eye!!!  And they&#x27;re not cheap and give you small tubes, they&#x27;re full-sized ones!  They&#x27;ll last you forever!!! I love it and when I run out, I&#x27;m gonna buy more and more and more!!! BEST THING EVER!!! But I suggest buying from the real website because I bought this at 50 and on the website I would&#x27;ve gotten it for 40 with a 20% off coupon on retailmenot.com.  It was only 48 on their website, but who knows, maybe shipping was more expensive (I have prime for now so I got free expedited shipping!)</li>
    <li> Excelente embalaje y rapidez de envio, son justo lo que se anuncia, los envases son mas grandes de lo que pensaba y los colores son muy hermosos, Lo amo!!!</li>
    <li> OMG These are the best, you will be complimented on these colors. Use them with glitter adhesive, it will look amazing!! you can get creative with these. great for Arabic applications,, or cut crease looks.. the best ever, affordable, a must buy. Great for makeup kits, I&#x27;m an esthetician with highly sensitive skin, and recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I waited for a while because it was out of stock and I think first order lost some where. But thank you so much AMAZON you are amazing like your name they send me new package one day delivery and I&#x27;m so happy. Going to attend a wedding and will show everyone. The colors are incredible for me, I&#x27;m in love with this. I think I don&#x27;t need to order for a while or look for any eyeshadow so bye bye Sephora and thank you Shany.</li>
    <li> These are great! They arrived as per the scheduled delivery date, and came excellently packaged. Some of the vials look like the repeat but they don&#x27;t; the repetitive looking ones have a glittery addition to them. The Eye shadow themselves maintain the Shany Cosmetics quality, and are just perfect.They are well made, and apply well. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is such a fun set!! And these pigments are easy to use- thank god no fallout unlike other high end brands I&#x27;ve used!!! These are build able as well - so you can go from shimmery to glittery depending on your mood!!!</li>
    <li> I have been waiting sooo long for Shany to come out with loose pigment eyeshadows! There are so many colors and it comes with brushes that are just a bonus on top of everything! The price was reasonable and the colors are vivid! Wonderful glitters and pearly colors to choose from! YAY!</li>
    <li> Awesome pigments and so much ...so colorful...so beautiful....I love the colors and u can use this for so much and its great to pair with ur style of clothing. Worth the money :)</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter that loves makeup. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I enjoy seeing her express herself through her makeup. She loves it and I&#x27;ve. Even used it a few times without her knowing. :)</li>
    <li> I love the idea behind minreal make up as it can be less toxic and more natural. Look at all those colors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a week ago and recieved it on time. Once i opened up the packaged everything was still in tack. Nice size pigments, almost the same size as MAC. The colors are beautiful, however out of 40 set of \\&quot;different colors\\&quot; exspect 2 sets of 3 to be the same pigments. i received 3 of the white/ cream color pigments which were all the same, as well as three orangeish redish pigments that were all the same. Despite the duplicate colors, im still inlove with them. They are true to color. Nice and bright and gliterie. This item is great for a beginner. Did i mention that two brushes come with it as well. Overal i give it 3 stars, just because i expected all my pigments to be different colors.</li>
    <li> I love the price, Color pay off. I am Blue girl though. I love my royals and midnight&#x27;s but out of this kit all i received is one light blue and a teal. I have 6 reds though... not as many browns either. Plus no neutrals. So if your into reds and oranges, plus yellows go for it! If not don&#x27;t. now keep in mind THE COLORS VARY PER ORDER. The color pay off is great.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful!! Very vibrant and great for going out. The brushes are very nice and soft as well.  The capsules are a great size and this whole set should last anyone for a LONG time. Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Beautiful  colors more vibrant and great colors than it shows in photo, really like the packaging&lt;br /&gt;and plus the two brushes !&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for home or professional use .</li>
    <li> GREAT COLORS!!! VERY PIGMENTED, GO ON WITH EASE, BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING A BASE SO IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO APPLY. BUT I LOVE THIS PIGMENT!!</li>
    <li> These are so beautiful.... worth it... i love the shine and sparkle make .net reality happy... great die everyone who loves makeup</li>
    <li> some of the colors i was unsure about,  but after wearing them and getting lots of complements i now use them all on a daily basis.  Great colors and highly pigmented</li>
</ol>
