    <li> Have used these for quite a while and absolutely love them I thought I better buy some to keep on hand . I purchased some of the microfiber ones they&#x27;re just do not absorb the water as well</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering.</li>
    <li> I use these to keep my hair protected in the sauna. They are thick cotton and look like they will last. I am very happy to have quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair that fits perfectly in these and dries without my hair being pulled. Makes it easier to get ready with a lightweight towel holding my hair rather than a full sized towel. Make sure you get these because they are terry cloth. The microfiber ones don&#x27;t work that well.</li>
    <li> These are nice and thick.  Very soft terrycloth.  They work so much better for young girls than a regular towel but they also fit an adult well.</li>
    <li> These turbie twist towels are so thick and fluffy. Love how well they absorb the water and keep my wet hair from dripping all over. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love these.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremly long hair, and they may now dry my hair completly, but they keep my hair from dripping while I get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;Love them.</li>
    <li> Gave as gift and it was a hit!</li>
    <li> Love love,this product. Ordered a second set for my sister. So plush!!</li>
    <li> Love these, with three girls in the house we go through tones of towels. Will be buying more. All the other ones I ordered were itchy and made for children.</li>
    <li> Thick,absorbent, wash nicely, fast ship, just PERFECT! Would order again.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. They are made of nice thick terry and not the thin microfiber. My only complaint is they got a little linty when I washed them (see photo) The photo compares these Turbie Twists to my microfiber Turbie Twists.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the terry cloth version of these for a while now.  Very soft and much more absorbent than the microfiber version. Such a great deal for four!</li>
    <li> I love these towels. Just received this new set and  I am not sharing! I love having the set so I always have a clean one available. I use them after every shower. Sometimes if I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair I will put one of these towels on instead of a shower cap, obviously it&#x27;s not waterproof but keeps my hair up and out of the water.</li>
    <li> I love turbie twist. I might buy more of these if they are still in stock bc the cotton ones are hard to find.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on beauty products; but these looked convenient and they are.  They&#x27;re nice to wear after you wash your hair while putting on your makeup, etc - not heavy on your head  and these don&#x27;t occasionally fall off like the wrapped towel does.</li>
    <li> Worked really well, I was surprised how well it actually worked.</li>
    <li> I love these!! I hate the new microfiber and it jacks up my hair! these are beautiful, arrived in 2 days, and are 100% cotton! Just like the ones I used to purchase in store!</li>
    <li> These are the brand of turbans you want to dry your hair. They are thick, absorbent, and well-made!  I recently purchased a different brand and was extremely disappointed. I left feedback on Amazon to help others avoid wasting their time and money. These are the ones you want!  My first purchase of these were at least 10 years ago and I am just replacing the set of three I bought all those many years ago.</li>
    <li> Do the job comfortably</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.....turbies are exactly as I expected and worth the money.  Well constructed and very absorbent!</li>
