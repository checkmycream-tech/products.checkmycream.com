      <li>| 20 more words</li>
      <li>Literally my favorite scent ever.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite colognes is Chanel Allure.</li>
      <li>Love, love this scent.  </li>
      <li>When it was presented to me by the saleswoman, she said that it was the most edible scent they had.</li>
      <li>has a nice semi sweet smell and lasts</li>
      <li>The fragance is strong so recommended for people that like it like that.</li>
      <li>Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>

      <li>and I very much enjoy it.</li>

      <li>hey if she thinks its hot!!</li>
      <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Tiene un aroma excelente, el producto lleg&amp;oacute; en su empaque original y la entrega en tiempo oportuno.</li>
      <li>Aunque en realidad prefiero el aroma de la versi&amp;oacute;n original, este huele bien, tiene una buena duraci&amp;oacute;n y un aroma agradable.</li>
      <li>like it, has a clean smell</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;ll end up paying 10x&#x27;s more constantly clearing up the STDs you&#x27;ll be catching.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sweet, chocolatey, synthetic, a bit offensive and all man.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, I received a full refund from the seller, FN.</li>
      <li>If I get a strong positive review from them...</li>
      <li>buy this, drop it on the floor, pull away the green stuff and display it proudly.</li>
      <li>It was a big seller, and those that own it understand why.</li>
      <li>The juice inside is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first encounter this overseas, wow, i have been using it for over four years, I love it.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor, go light on the trigger, steer clear of Bingo halls and grab a bottle for those cool summer days.</li>
      <li>My son loves this stuff and I wasnt able to find it in the local stores</li>
      <li>was my first thought.  </li>
      <li>The first time I purchased it, I went through over 20 scents before picking this one.</li>
      <li>and it was sent right out and its the real thing.</li>
      <li>Smell good and I revived a NEW perfume not like the other one.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colognes, very unique and long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>I really like Animale Animale and my girlfriend</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Instead, all I got were very pungent and overpowering spicy, citrus notes...</li>
      <li>WOW !!!</li>
      <li>Is a hybrid scent between a classic and modern aroma.</li>
      <li>has finally gotten my skin more tolerant to keeping colognes lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend getting it.</li>
      <li>Amen has the superior dry down, longevity and projection.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with those old school glass case fragrances you saw in Mexican or Persian owned, flea market-style clothing stores, you might remember this.</li>
      <li>secretly good stuff - horrible old packaging lol</li>
      <li>required.&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue - Women (Similar) Designer Fragrance Roll On Perfume - .3 fl.</li>
      <li>(9 ml)&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue - Women (Similar) Designer Fragrance Roll On...</li>
      <li>Old man in bottle!.....</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although, as far as longevity goes, this actually last pretty well on my skin.</li>
      <li>It is definitely not an A*men pure malt substitute.</li>
      <li>Smells great, but for cold or at least cool weather only IMO.</li>
      <li>It gets a little cloying when it&#x27;s hot and humid.</li>
      <li>I cannot stress this enough, go light on the trigger for all that is holy and try not to wear it on hot, muggy days.</li>
      <li>I just know what smells good or bad) .</li>

<li> , I am no professional and my nose isn&#x27;t that trained to pick up different scents.</li>
<li> Smells distinctly different than other men&#x27;s colognes.  </li>
<li> Last week I accidentally knocked it off of my etagere onto my tile floor and the green plastic fascia shattered.</li>
<li> guys like to smell cologne for themselves because it gives them a mental boost.</li>
<li> I have yet to find anyone wearing it other than myself, but it is always complimented.</li>
<li> I have a very dry skin and nothing last past a few hours on me</li>
<li> A slight resemblance to Thierry Muglers Amen, but with a dated feel.</li>
<li> This reminds me of that fragrance but is less than 1/3 the cost.</li>
<li> Feels a little dated</li>
<li> I was unable to find it for some time and ran across it through Amazon at a terrific price.  </li>
<li> Now it&#x27;s just the clear plastic bottle without the stupid green marbled lightning bolt cloak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s missing the coal tar whiff, expert formulation, heavyweight marketing and legions of tipsy Jersey Shore clubbers behind it.</li>
<li> If you like a subtle spicy aroma - this is it.  </li>
<li> name is ridiculous and the packaging is even worse.</li>
<li> Longevity is weak.</li>
<li> While it&#x27;s highly unlikely anybody will mistake this for A*MEN, they will mistake you for a super-sexy millionaire playboy...and therein lies my dilemma.</li>
<li> I bought a bottle from Fragrance Net, and it smells horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells like Cartier Santos for a fraction of the money</li>
    <li> A slight resemblance to Thierry Muglers Amen, but with a dated feel. Opening of this fragrance is very different to Amen, only the middle is somewhat similar. Amen has the superior dry down, longevity and projection.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find anyone wearing it other than myself, but it is always complimented. I&#x27;ve worn it for years and I very much enjoy it. The first time I purchased it, I went through over 20 scents before picking this one. When it was presented to me by the saleswoman, she said that it was the most edible scent they had. I agree.</li>
    <li> secretly good stuff - horrible old packaging lol</li>
    <li> Very Happy with my purchased.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like the wonderful 90&#x27;s fragrance I remember.</li>
    <li> Smell good and I revived a NEW perfume not like the other one.</li>
    <li> Tiene un aroma excelente, el producto lleg&amp;oacute; en su empaque original y la entrega en tiempo oportuno. Buen precio comparado con el tama&amp;ntilde;o del producto. Recomiendo este perfume y este vendedor para sus futuras compras.</li>
    <li> ANIMALE ANIMALE is an outstanding fragrance for the money! As stated elsewhere, it&#x27;s a bit similar to Mugler&#x27;s A*MEN but it&#x27;s missing the coal tar whiff, expert formulation, heavyweight marketing and legions of tipsy Jersey Shore clubbers behind it. While it&#x27;s highly unlikely anybody will mistake this for A*MEN, they will mistake you for a super-sexy millionaire playboy...and therein lies my dilemma. The price point may be low but you&#x27;ll end up paying 10x&#x27;s more constantly clearing up the STDs you&#x27;ll be catching. Do yourself a favor, go light on the trigger, steer clear of Bingo halls and grab a bottle for those cool summer days. I cannot stress this enough, go light on the trigger for all that is holy and try not to wear it on hot, muggy days. Your fellow Pace Bus riders will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sweet, chocolatey, synthetic, a bit offensive and all man. If you&#x27;re familiar with those old school glass case fragrances you saw in Mexican or Persian owned, flea market-style clothing stores, you might remember this. It was a big seller, and those that own it understand why. BADABOOM!</li>
    <li> Great fragance, bought this on behalf of a cousin and everyone like it. The fragance is strong so recommended for people that like it like that.</li>
    <li> like it, has a clean smell</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews about this scent, I had to buy one for myself and I was not disappointed. The dark chocolate scent is perfect for evening dates when the air is cool. It gets a little cloying when it&#x27;s hot and humid.</li>
    <li> What a great deal and a great scent.  I get comliments everytime I wear this cologne. I was unable to find it for some time and ran across it through Amazon at a terrific price.  I will order it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It was not the product I ask, the product I ask was animale, and not Animale Animale I open the box thinking that change the presentation but  it was a diferent product.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells very good, i never had used it, but when i opened the box, inmediatly i liked the frangance!</li>
    <li> Old man in bottle!.....was my first thought.  But its actually starting to grow on me. Its a bit of a gourmand scent.  Feels a little dated but I can&#x27;t seem to part with it.  Lets see how the ladies respond to it.  If I get a strong positive review from them...I&#x27;ll  keep it.</li>
    <li> Literally my favorite scent ever. I look forward to buying again.</li>
    <li> My dad has been wearing this for years, but can no longer find it in stores here at home.  So I was thrilled that I could get this for him for Father&#x27;s Day on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a timely manner and he loved it!</li>
    <li> WOW !!! I WORE THIS TO WORK AN GOT BIT ON THE NECK BY A FEMALE CO-WORKER,...ENOUGH SAID!!! AGAIN WEAR WITH CAUTION !!!</li>
    <li> My son wanted this for christmas. He had never smelled it before I ordered it. He loves it. It has a great smell, not too strong.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my husband</li>
    <li> My son loves this stuff and I wasnt able to find it in the local stores so I found it at my favorite place to shop..... and it was sent right out and its the real thing.</li>
    <li> The fragrance has been diluted</li>
    <li> It was Excellent. Nice doing Business with you. Thanks. Keep up the good wroks.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but for cold or at least cool weather only IMO. Projects a good six feet for 6 to 8 hours. Lasts on skin another 4.</li>
    <li> I first encounter this overseas, wow, i have been using it for over four years, I love it. i will use it for ever.</li>
    <li> View tips and guidelines | 20 more words required.&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue - Women (Similar) Designer Fragrance Roll On Perfume - .3 fl. oz (9 ml)&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue - Women (Similar) Designer Fragrance Roll On...</li>
    <li> Not the same parfum,does not last for up to an hours,disappointed.Thought getting this from Amazon will guaranty the quailty,I was very wrong.</li>
    <li> give it try, if you like perfumes</li>
    <li> This smells great. Always get compliments when wearing it. I highly recommend getting it. Its one of my top scents.</li>
    <li> The smell is alright. I&#x27;ve never smelled the popular cologne that came after Animale Animale, however I would probably purchase that one before I purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is longevity. Smell is good. Projection is good. Longevity is weak. I can still smell it after 6 hours, however no one else can smell it.&lt;br /&gt;Some guys like to smell cologne for themselves because it gives them a mental boost. I like others to smell my cologne so that they get a boost (in my direction).&lt;br /&gt;Oh well. I will make the best of it.</li>
    <li> Did not reach the shipment. You to inform you of. Was the amount of money recovered until today  this is what happened to me</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle from Fragrance Net, and it smells horrible. Nothing at all like I was expecting. Based on others&#x27; reviews, I was hoping to get a pleasant, sweet gourmand fragrance, with hints of vanilla, honey, and chocolate. Instead, all I got were very pungent and overpowering spicy, citrus notes... even after hours of drydown. The bottle I got was nothing like others described so maybe I got a bad bottle, or it was reformulated. Thankfully, I received a full refund from the seller, FN.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes is Chanel Allure. This reminds me of that fragrance but is less than 1/3 the cost. I really like Animale Animale and my girlfriend does too. This is probably the fifth or sixth time I&#x27;ve purchased it over the last fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name is ridiculous and the packaging is even worse. Possibly the ugliest and cheapest packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen. Last week I accidentally knocked it off of my etagere onto my tile floor and the green plastic fascia shattered. Voila! Now it&#x27;s just the clear plastic bottle without the stupid green marbled lightning bolt cloak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: buy this, drop it on the floor, pull away the green stuff and display it proudly. The juice inside is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it five stars because, for the money, it&#x27;s an incredible value for how wonderful it smells (which I know is subjective but I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments on it). If it was twice the price I&#x27;d give it four stars. For the same price as Chanel Allure I&#x27;d give it three.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes, very unique and long lasting scent. Is a hybrid scent between a classic and modern aroma.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great. lots of compliments. has a nice semi sweet smell and lasts</li>
    <li> From all the reviews they all said it had a nice gourmand scent but I don&#x27;t get it at all (mind you, I am no professional and my nose isn&#x27;t that trained to pick up different scents. I just know what smells good or bad) . Then it just smells like something cheap that you picked up at a gas station. It is definitely not an A*men pure malt substitute. I am planning to get the 24 gold cologne and I hope that has a better vanilla/ chocolate scent that is pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, as far as longevity goes, this actually last pretty well on my skin. I have a very dry skin and nothing last past a few hours on me but I had this and for 4 hours I could still smell it good compared to 1 million and a*men that I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have 212, 212 vip, 1 million, a*men, nautica voyager. Just to let you know my taste. All those fragrances dont last on my skin as long as this for some reason or maybe the lotion I bought recently has finally gotten my skin more tolerant to keeping colognes lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update... I must be spoiled from hoping this will be like a*men but it isnt bad. My girlfriend seems to like it alot, so hey if she thinks its hot!! Then I have no complaints at all. its definitely a solid bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Very nice price and he has tried before .</li>
    <li> Love, love this scent.  I&#x27;m always asked what I&#x27;m wearing when I have it own.  Smells distinctly different than other men&#x27;s colognes.  If you like a subtle spicy aroma - this is it.  Guarantee guys you wear this - people will notice - in a good way!</li>
    <li> Aunque en realidad prefiero el aroma de la versi&amp;oacute;n original, este huele bien, tiene una buena duraci&amp;oacute;n y un aroma agradable.</li>
