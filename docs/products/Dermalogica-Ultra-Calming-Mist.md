      <li>I love it !  </li>
      <li>My favorite product!  </li>
      <li>I love this mist!  </li>
      <li>Im sure this is good for most people, but I got contact dermatitis all over my face from this product, ironically.</li>
      <li>Has so many amazing uses.</li>
      <li>good product quick shipping</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such a wonderful product!</li>
      <li>Also love the Antioxidant Hydramist spray..</li>
      <li>smoothing protection spray is much better, hydrating, and soothing, calms the itchness and redness.    </li>
      <li>Truly like a magical potion and worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>Great products, recommend  them to anyone with sensitive and reactionary skin.</li>
      <li>It gives you a refreshed cool feeling!  </li>
      <li>I have to use this every time I clean, even with the most moisturizing cleanser.</li>
      <li>The money is in the fine ingredients and science, not in the packaging and advertising.</li>
      <li>I spray it on a cotton ball and use it more like a toner than spray and find that it does a good job removing anything left over after I wash.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that being paired up with the cleanser of the same product line, it would feel good and refreshing</li>
      <li>Use from anything from a mild skin irritation to an allergic reaction to helping cuts and scrapes heal faster to skin rashes, etc.</li>
      <li>I bought this to help calm my rosacea and it works well.</li>
      <li>I use it every night to tighten my pores and calm my skin after using [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>For sensitive skin, put this under and over make-up and spritz throughout the day instead of using more lotion.</li>
      <li>I was able to save considerably by buying it through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have been prescribed adderall for managing my adult ADD for many years.</li>
      <li>amazon is the bomb, you all always come through for me on the products i like and with awesome pricing as usual...!!!</li>
      <li>Or, if you&#x27;re close to a Dermalogica salon or retailer, they&#x27;re usually very generous with samples!</li>
      <li>fabulous for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This product has taken the place of an even better (and 2 ounces larger) version.</li>
      <li>, i buy larger sizes to get better pricing.</li>
      <li>I have  noticed a positive  change in my skin  since using this product.</li>
      <li>I honestly believe it will work for most people, especially as I&#x27;ve tried nearly every \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; product at Sephora not to mention the regular brands like Aveeno, Clearasil, and Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
      <li>These products are pure.  </li>
      <li>From age 14 to 22 I had acne and now (at age 28) I still battle pimples, large pores, and oily skin.</li>
      <li>and it really calms it and helps prevent any blemishes.  </li>
      <li>The redness has almost gone away and my skin is much smoother.</li>
      <li>I really notice a difference in redness reduction, and it is very soothing after chemical exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I will be using some other product unless their other formulation has the great scent.</li>
      <li>Additionally, if I ever apply makeup long after cleansing, I reapply only the toner as it seems to add a nice bit of moisture without caking anything.  </li>
      <li>My skin is known as \\&quot;senile\\&quot; at my age and the water where I live is very drying.</li>
      <li>This regimen has cleared up my skin (actually better than I expected considering how gentle the cleanser is) and almost totally evened out my skin tone (nearly ZERO rosacea!).</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it and you will find you can&#x27;t, as well.</li>
      <li>I relax my mind and look in the mirror and the huge embarrassing red blotches that would have started going nuts on my neck and chest calm down.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin with rosacea.</li>
      <li>After the earlier version was discontinued, I tried many other mists that did not work.</li>
      <li>Plus, I&#x27;m allergic to some random synthetic stuff (mostly in shampoos and conditioners) and allergic reactions have made my skin super sensitized.</li>
      <li>My skin still gets pink, but the embarrassing hot feeling has stopped!</li>
      <li>If this sounds like you, but you still were having issues (either your skin was breaking out or really irritated), then I&#x27;d definitely recommend Dermalogica&#x27;s UltraCalming line.     </li>
      <li>I have slightly sensitive skin and it cleared up immediately after a week of use.</li>
      <li>(I even use it on my dog&#x27;s with sensitive skin and on their paws.).  </li>
      <li>This toner says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, and I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d nearly given up on anything that promised to reduce redness AND keep my skin clear.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m not sure what kind of sensitive skin it is intended for, but clearly not everyone.</li>
      <li>I use this twice a day, and a bottle generally lasts 3-4 months.</li>

<li> One of the few products I can use on my face if my very sensitive skin is inflamed.  </li>
<li> I often get anxious and blotchy red in social situations or when public speaking.</li>
<li> It definitely calms down the burning And discomfort in my face!</li>
<li> Came as expected...</li>
<li> Expensive but worth it.  </li>
<li> Not what I was expecting, for a product specifically formulated/made for those with sensitive skin, why does this product leave such a film behind?  </li>
<li> (I no longer use Dermalogica moisturizer other than Barrier Repair because it has a musty odor.  </li>
<li> I used 2 other moisturizers for about 15 years before this problem surfaced--probably outsourcing some ingredient manufacture overseas.)</li>
<li> I have extremely thin and sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> I spray this before I know an uncomfortable event is approaching and breathe deeply.</li>
<li> Recently my skin has broken out with itchy patches on my face.</li>
<li> I just could not stand it, I had to rinse it off within minutes as it felt disgusting to have this kind of sticky weird feeling junk on my skin after it was properly cleansed just moments</li>
<li> Not sure  what it does, doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  </li>
<li> but I mean it.</li>
<li> No more redness!</li>
<li> I have bad skin.</li>
<li> This one doesn&#x27;t, very disappointing.  </li>
<li> Used as a base for moisturizer</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This toner says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, and I have extremely sensitive skin - however, it made my face, neck and chest breakout into a red, itchy rash. So I&#x27;m not sure what kind of sensitive skin it is intended for, but clearly not everyone. Also, I tried to return the product once I realized it wasn&#x27;t suited for my skin, but it is non-returnable!</li>
    <li> I love it !  Goes with the Serum concentrate.  fabulous for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This spray has been really good for my skin. I have been using it for years now. I am in my 30&#x27;s and still prone to breaking out. I spray this on my skin after I wash my face and it really calms it and helps prevent any blemishes.  I have also sprayed it on my sun burn or razor burn and it calms the irritation. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this line two months ago while having a facial, and purchased the starter kit.  I can&#x27;t get over the results!  No more redness!</li>
    <li> I have bad skin. I know, everyone says that... but I mean it. From age 14 to 22 I had acne and now (at age 28) I still battle pimples, large pores, and oily skin. Plus, I&#x27;m allergic to some random synthetic stuff (mostly in shampoos and conditioners) and allergic reactions have made my skin super sensitized. I&#x27;d nearly given up on anything that promised to reduce redness AND keep my skin clear. That was until I stumbled upon the UltraCalming line. I honestly believe it will work for most people, especially as I&#x27;ve tried nearly every \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; product at Sephora not to mention the regular brands like Aveeno, Clearasil, and Clean &amp; Clear. If this sounds like you, but you still were having issues (either your skin was breaking out or really irritated), then I&#x27;d definitely recommend Dermalogica&#x27;s UltraCalming line.     This toner is awesome!  I use it every night to tighten my pores and calm my skin after using [[ASIN:B003OL2ER4 Dermalogica Ultracalming Cleanser 16 oz]] and before using the [[ASIN:B003QDAZAI Dermalogica UltraCalming Serum Concentrate - 1.7 oz]].  Additionally, if I ever apply makeup long after cleansing, I reapply only the toner as it seems to add a nice bit of moisture without caking anything.  This regimen has cleared up my skin (actually better than I expected considering how gentle the cleanser is) and almost totally evened out my skin tone (nearly ZERO rosacea!). I understand everyone is different and so would recommend purchasing the Dermalogica The Ultra Calming Treatment Kit 5 piece before investing in the full-size products. Or, if you&#x27;re close to a Dermalogica salon or retailer, they&#x27;re usually very generous with samples!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help calm my rosacea and it works well. I spray it on a cotton ball and use it more like a toner than spray and find that it does a good job removing anything left over after I wash. I have  noticed a positive  change in my skin  since using this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure  what it does, doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  just like mist of  water.  smoothing protection spray is much better, hydrating, and soothing, calms the itchness and redness.    Dermalogica Soothing protection spray on ebay    [...]</li>
    <li> I have extremely thin and sensitive skin.  I use this as a second step after cleansing.  Calming layer with no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it everyday..perfect before makeup application! Also love the Antioxidant Hydramist spray..both products are excellent and keep you skin hydrated and balanced!</li>
    <li> This toner used to have a great calming fragrance that I loved.  This one doesn&#x27;t, very disappointing.  I will be using some other product unless their other formulation has the great scent.</li>
    <li> I love this mist!  It gives you a refreshed cool feeling!  It definitely calms down the burning And discomfort in my face!</li>
    <li> My skins best friend...been using it for years</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!! Can&#x27;t live without it and you will find you can&#x27;t, as well. Has so many amazing uses. (I even use it on my dog&#x27;s with sensitive skin and on their paws.).  The calming mist is one if the best kept secrets and I am SO very glad I found it. Use from anything from a mild skin irritation to an allergic reaction to helping cuts and scrapes heal faster to skin rashes, etc. Truly like a magical potion and worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> very nice! I have slightly sensitive skin and it cleared up immediately after a week of use.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and feel the product does a good job.</li>
    <li> Works great good product</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  And the price on here is excellent. I use this twice a day, and a bottle generally lasts 3-4 months. I really notice a difference in redness reduction, and it is very soothing after chemical exfoliation.</li>

    <li> amazon is the bomb, you all always come through for me on the products i like and with awesome pricing as usual...!!!</li>
    <li> Helps a rash that I keep getting on my face.  These products are pure.  Do some research.  Expensive but worth it.  The money is in the fine ingredients and science, not in the packaging and advertising.</li>
    <li> good product quick shipping, i buy larger sizes to get better pricing.</li>
    <li> Im sure this is good for most people, but I got contact dermatitis all over my face from this product, ironically. I wonder what it was...</li>
    <li> My skin is known as \\&quot;senile\\&quot; at my age and the water where I live is very drying. I have to use this every time I clean, even with the most moisturizing cleanser. This product has taken the place of an even better (and 2 ounces larger) version. After the earlier version was discontinued, I tried many other mists that did not work. Then I found this replacement product. It is more expensive, a smaller bottle and not quite as moisturizing but it is the best thing I&#x27;ve found. I was able to save considerably by buying it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is good to use with the ultracalming serum. Recently my skin has broken out with itchy patches on my face. These two products together helped &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; my skin.</li>
    <li> Save&#x27;s my skin in the winter. For sensitive skin, put this under and over make-up and spritz throughout the day instead of using more lotion. A wonderful product. Youth in a bottle.</li>
    <li> One of the few products I can use on my face if my very sensitive skin is inflamed.  Used as a base for moisturizer (I no longer use Dermalogica moisturizer other than Barrier Repair because it has a musty odor.  I used 2 other moisturizers for about 15 years before this problem surfaced--probably outsourcing some ingredient manufacture overseas.)</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin with rosacea. I never know when my skin will flare up. These products have helped my skin a great deal. The redness has almost gone away and my skin is much smoother. Great products, recommend  them to anyone with sensitive and reactionary skin.</li>
    <li> I have been prescribed adderall for managing my adult ADD for many years. This product is a lifesaver for me. I often get anxious and blotchy red in social situations or when public speaking. I spray this before I know an uncomfortable event is approaching and breathe deeply. I relax my mind and look in the mirror and the huge embarrassing red blotches that would have started going nuts on my neck and chest calm down. My skin still gets pink, but the embarrassing hot feeling has stopped! Thank you for making such a wonderful product! I am reordering every month!</li>
    <li> My favorite product!  Came as expected...wonderful service :)</li>
