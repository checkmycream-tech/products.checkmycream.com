      <li>It never lets me down from the he first use to the last!!!!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to people with thicker, coarser hair who want a little less frizz and volume and a little more softness and luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I normally have very dry, damaged, brittle, and coarse hair - so this hair repair conditioner is a GOD SEND!</li>

    <li> Really like this. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I would still order it again. I&#x27;m a sucker for good hair products.</li>
    <li> This hair repair product does just as it says -- I used it as directed and my hair was silky smooth afterward. I have curly hair that tens to frizz, so this is a great product for me.</li>
    <li> does a good job! nice smell of the sea</li>
    <li> That being said, I&#x27;ve used conditioners of similar or better quality at a much lower price point.  I received this product as a sample in my Birchbox subscription.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 10 months ago and haven&#x27;t even used half yet. I use this 2-3 times a week. This was a great buy and it lasts forever! It leaves my hair so soft and shiny. I use it together with the Leave In Conditioner and it rejuvenates my bleached-out hair. I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> Really love this product. It made my hair really soft. It&#x27;s a little pricey but you don&#x27;t need too much to coat your hair and mine is very thick. I use it as a leave in treatment overnight and wash out in morning and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor complaint is the scent--it&#x27;s kinda cheap smelling. Not the high end product smell I was expecting (like Oribe for example). But some people love the scent so that&#x27;s a personal opinion only and it doesn&#x27;t affect product efficacy.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely OBSESSED with this hair repair serum!!! I use it once a week, and my hair is left so insanely soft, smooth, and silky that I&#x27;m always surprised when touching my own hair. I normally have very dry, damaged, brittle, and coarse hair - so this hair repair conditioner is a GOD SEND! I highly recommend it to people with thicker, coarser hair who want a little less frizz and volume and a little more softness and luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair repair products.  It is pricey but worth it!!!  I use it anytime my hair is beyond repair.  It never lets me down from the he first use to the last!!!!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine frizzy hair, this conditions is great, but you can&#x27;t use it every time, it seems to start leave a build up on your hair, I recommend using once per week. I like the smell, but it can be a little strong at first.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser. But the Salon discontinued it so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  I have very fly away hair and this helps it to be manageable.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist (at one of the top salons in San Francisco) recommended this conditioner as a once-weekly deep moisturizer. It works best when left on for 5-10 min and when the hair is combed with a wide-tooth comb after the product is put in. Love it! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel super soft and healthy!</li>
    <li> Did not weigh down my shoulder length hair.  Adds body and depth with a pleasant scent.  Would highly recommend.  Not shipped by Amazon, so packaging left a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for better results...</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for both hair and beards! I use this product every couple of days in addition to a daily conditioner and it keeps my curly hair &amp; beard very soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair treatment expensive though</li>
    <li> I ordered the hair repair but got the dry hair conditioner instead. Bad service. Took a long time for this to ship as well.</li>
    <li> i agree with other reviewers and felt my hair was a little straw-like after using.  even when i apply in the shower and it is still in my hair it doesn&#x27;t feel as silky smooth. i&#x27;ve used the EVO protein treatment, and prefer that. my hair dresser had recommended this product.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me as one of my holiday gifts. The smell and the texture is very luxe and I love the way my hair feels. It&#x27;s soft and I actually saw less hair fall out in the shower than usual.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST investment I have ever made on my hair. I have bleached, dry and overworked hair and when I leave this on for 10 mins it&#x27;s like having a head of new hair. My hair is silky, shiny and manageable. I LOVE IT  LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!! If they ever stop selling it here in the USA I will fly to Sweden to buy it!</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner, it softens up your hair and repairs it! it is great for people who swim alot</li>
    <li> great product great price</li>
    <li> Found the product originally via a Birchbox sample.  I am a guy, and this is the best hair product I have ever used.  My hair has never been softer and less frizzy.</li>
