### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best for me to use as a treatment cream.</li>
      <li>Perfect amount of drying and medication</li>
      <li>This product works best for me for overnight spot treatment.</li>
      <li>That is the best part about this product and why I would continue to use it.</li>
      <li>this gives splendid results...</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say the smell is great - but it is not too off-putting.  </li>

      <li>This really is a great product.  </li>
      <li>works great for me.  </li>
      <li>Great addition to my skin care regime.</li>
      <li>I also noticed that when I break out around my time of the month, that any pimples that I have are greatly reduced.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve always loved the Purifying Mask and continued to buy it, even though it costs what seems like a lot for what I use it for: spot treatment.</li>
      <li>so I guess it is a good value.</li>
      <li>Always loved this mask.  </li>
      <li>She said it didn&#x27;t smell particularly great, but it didn&#x27;t bother her at all, and it didn&#x27;t matter because she really liked the way her face felt after using it.</li>
      <li>knocked one star off because it promises to be a good spot treatment, yet it does literally nothing in that capacity for me, my husband, or my daughter.</li>
      <li>Proactiv+ has a good reputation for eliminating breakouts and also helping those suffering from acne.  </li>
      <li>really good drying face mask.  </li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t have especially good results using it as an overnight treatment, but I suspect it would have worked much better had she been able to use it as the pimple was forming instead of once it became established.</li>
      <li>This skin purifying mask does nothing for blackheads (as most products don&#x27;t!)</li>
      <li>Shockingly effective.</li>
      <li>but this is a 90-day supply, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the appearance of my own skin and</li>
      <li>/&gt;Things I liked about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is so popular,</li>
      <li>Sulfur is excellent in treating the acne I get from Rosacea, and because the main ingredient in Proactive+ is sulfur, Proactive+</li>
      <li>The one thing I have always liked and found the most effective is the mask.  </li>
      <li>My Daughter, who has a more widespread acne problem has also using been using it and her results from using it just twice have been remarkable, she is going to start using the full pro-active line after trying this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;&#x27;ll eventually get another chance to try it.</li>
      <li>The best way to use it, in my opinion, is as an occasional spot treatment for small-to-medium whiteheads, pimples and blackheads.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, great product</li>
      <li>Even more so at $40.</li>
      <li>product doesn&#x27;t produce stunning results, but when used as intended it does help.</li>
      <li>They both love the Proactiv+</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s potent but non-drying for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I love Proactiv+ products and it&#x27;s one that you can say</li>
      <li>still love it</li>
      <li>I like the product and plan to get more.</li>
      <li>I use it more as a spot treatment when i go to bed.</li>
      <li>The smell is innocuous, and more of a non-smell than anything.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
      <li>compared with it&#x27;s competition, I would not rate it any better than it&#x27;s cheaper competitors.</li>
      <li>Better yet, schedule an appointment with your aesthetician and they will map your face.</li>
      <li>Better yet, schedule an appointment with your aesthetician and they will map your face.ht of tossing and turning.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel after using it as a mask.</li>
      <li>Most all products in this line</li>
      <li>the plus side, sulfur doesn’t seem to cause the problems with skin irritation and uv sensitivity that many acne treatments may promote.</li>
      <li>The gist of the article is that sulfur improves, though perhaps not cures, many skin conditions, including acne and rosacea.  </li>
      <li>and then wash it off - and both say that afterwards their skin is better.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s keeping the fourteen year-old&#x27;s acne mostly under control, a miracle</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hopeful that as I continue using the product, I will have a better outcome with my oily face.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>It is a natural mask that tightens as it dries, rinses cleanly and has a wonderful organic scent.  </li>
      <li>It is a natural mask that tightens as it dries, rinses cleanly and has a wonderful organic scent.  </li>
      <li>I think that Proactiv is one of the most, if not THE most, advertised over the counter acne treatment regimens available.  </li>
      <li>Clay works fine and has for many years.  </li>
      <li>So, I can foresee this situation being the primary caveat for many consumers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>albeit rinse easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is too strong to use all over my skin.</li>
      <li>This mask seems to reduce redness and smooth out my skin texture.</li>
      <li>primary source I went to was an article in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, from 2004, by Aditya K. Gupta.  </li>
      <li>It can be a challenge to get completely off; I use it before showering and find that the most effective way to rinse it off.</li>
      <li>trial using a lotion with 5% sulfur and 10 % sodium sulfacetamide was very effective, but note that this Proactiv+ mask doesn’t contain that second ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That worked well for me in making my skin smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t wash off the skin very easily, and lasts the whole night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I stopped using this product because it did nothing for me, even after I continued to use it once I wrote my original review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as successful overall that I wanted</li>
      <li>In fact, she deemed the latter  arguably more effective.</li>
      <li>Tried it the way the instructions on the back label were written and the method of keeping it on for a longer period (about an hour) and found it was more effective the longer</li>
      <li>Like the old version better!</li>
      <li>This product holds true to the quality and effectiveness</li>
      <li>That is what finally piqued my interest to accept this product and see if it will stand up to my beloved Dermalogica.  </li>
      <li>Good for even occasional use.  </li>
      <li>It is good to use on a weekly basis to up your game, but the thing I liked most is to use it as a spot treatment.  </li>
      <li>It also did not leave my skin with that fresh, clean, tingly feeling. ....</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Luckily, ProActive shrink-wraps their products before putting them into the retail box as a tamper-resistant measure that also prevents product spillage during shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a a sulfur-based acne treatment that luckily does not smell like sulphur (rotten eggs).at the product would have spilled and leaked.  </li>

      <li>Perhaps others will find more to love in these as facial cleansing agents, but not in this household.</li>
      <li>Sulfur has mild antibacterial and antifungal properties.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>These blemishes quickly went away.  </li>
      <li>the very first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>have very sensitive skin, and most acne products irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>their products work and they are worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Definitely WORTH the price because of the quantity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>But one will need to decide if it&#x27;s worth paying $40 for a 3 ounce tube.</li>
      <li>Completely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I said, I (and now the fourteen year-old too) didn&#x27;t think the rest of the total system that much effect on my acne and while this is a great spot treatment, if you have a larger problem you may want more.</li>
      <li>And the products seems worth it to people who use it -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Proactiv over the years and have had a lot of success with it.</li>
      <li>If it does work, then it would be worth the splurge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was excited to find that it left my skin VERY smooth.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Always loved this mask.  I also spot use over night, if I have a blemish I just leave a dab on overnight and it works miracles.</li>
    <li> The mask works for me.  I use it twice a week for 10 min before shower.  It is easy to use.  Yesterday I felt a breakout starting on my chin, so I used the mask for 10 min before shower and in the morning the breakout was gone.  I would have rated it 5 stars if not for the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sulfur-based masks in the past, but never liked them because of the smell.  When I opened up the tube and took a whiff of this one, I was pleasantly surprised that it had virtually no odor at all. Well, that was until I applied it to my damp skin.  Ugh, the same rotten egg smell as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick mask,like toothpaste.  You simply apply to damp skin, and rinse off after 10 minutes.  I was excited to find that it left my skin VERY smooth.  Unfortunately, even after washing my face and applying my usual products, I could smell the sulfur all day.  Not very strong, but an unpleasant whiff every once in a while.  Probably not something you&#x27;d want to use on \\&quot;date night.\\&quot; ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is very drying.  The outer portions of my face are drier now that I&#x27;m middle aged, so I only use this in my T-zone.  But my younger, oilier self would have benefited from a full face of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like what it&#x27;s doing for my complexion, but that smell...</li>
    <li> Used for over 14 years.....still love it</li>
    <li> My husband and my daughter swear by Proactive products.  I am pretty lucky to not need much in the way of acne medication - but they use many of the products - especially the cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they have a breakout - they use this mask.  I wouldn&#x27;t say the smell is great - but it is not too off-putting.  They leave it on for a short while (10 minutes?) and then wash it off - and both say that afterwards their skin is better.  They don&#x27;t have to use it all the time - just during periods of acne flare ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the price is a bit high - but this is a 90-day supply, which is nice.  And the products seems worth it to people who use it - so I guess it is a good value.</li>
    <li> really good drying face mask.  Tried it the way the instructions on the back label were written and the method of keeping it on for a longer period (about an hour) and found it was more effective the longer it is kept on.  Drastically reduces the swelling in whiteheads and brings blackheads to the surface.  Great for sensitive skin, I had no adverse reactions to any of it&#x27;s ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When compared with it&#x27;s competition, I would not rate it any better than it&#x27;s cheaper competitors.</li>
    <li> The mask goes on well and it seems to help, although I don&#x27;t notice a massive difference, especially for the price. Still, I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to get this, Now I feel happy, this gives splendid results... Thanks Proactive...</li>
    <li> Proactiv is a product I&#x27;ve tried off and on for the past 20 years or so.  Some work, others don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not a mask in the sense that it tightens on your skin and you peel it off.  Rather, it&#x27;s a paste that sits on your skin and then you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the mask smelled terrible, definitely would not buy this product in the future due to the smell.  It also did not leave my skin with that fresh, clean, tingly feeling. ....and the smell lingered, and lingered....and then lingered some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If using as a spot treatment you don&#x27;t have the strong smell factor since you&#x27;re using just a small amount, so in that respect it&#x27;s much better.  I have not noticed a huge difference in my overall skin appearance.</li>
    <li> Good for even occasional use.  I don&#x27;t have serious acne, just a tiny issue here and there.  Mostly my pores want to enlarge a little and let impurities do the damage after settling on my skin.  My complexion is sensitive and does not accept moisturizers or stringent cleaners.  Using this product a few times per week ( or less) keeps me ahead of the game by thoroughly deep cleansing and minimizing pore size.  This mask does more for me than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of drying and medication</li>
    <li> I started using this mask back in 2008. I use it more as a spot treatment when i go to bed. If i&#x27;m breaking out, at night i&#x27;ll dab a little on the spots and wake up to them being gone or significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not apply it to my entire face a s full mask because i find that it is too drying. It also can be a bit smelly due to the sulfur even after washing off. I do not use the other proactive products anymore as they became too harsh but the mask i&#x27;ve kept up with because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big issue is that its super expensive. Being I use it as a spot treatment, it lasts a very long time. Probably a year or so. And that makes the cost not so bad.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive, (adult) acne prone skin.  This was my first time using a proactive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I liked about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Despite being for acne, it did not dry out my skin.  Many purifying masks burn once they are dry...no burning at all&lt;br /&gt;2.. This mask has small particles that exfoliate your face while applying the mask.  The exfoliant was not too rough on my dry sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It really works.  I had several blemishes on my skin when I applied this.  These blemishes quickly went away.  The only one that did not was a cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I found this product to be great for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Love the product.</li>
    <li> I rated this proactive 4 stars deep-cleansing sulfur mask formulated to clear acne blemishes. I&#x27;m not sure this can help prevent new breakouts from forming, since mine are hormonal pimples. This treatment does helps to absorb excess oil but is drying all over my face. I Use the mask as a cleansing one time a week to refine the appearance of pores, or as an overnight spot treatment to clear emerging acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is too strong to use all over my skin. Best for me to use as a treatment cream.</li>
    <li> This mask in just a week has resulted in noticeable changes in my skin. I have rare acne but uneven texture and some red tones to my pale complexion. This mask seems to reduce redness and smooth out my skin texture. It takes 10 minutes to work and doesn&#x27;t really harden. It can be a challenge to get completely off; I use it before showering and find that the most effective way to rinse it off. I find that if I doesn&#x27;t get every bit if, it can be gritty on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important to me, it does not leave my skin dried and tight. Great addition to my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I cannot use Proactiv&#x27;s other products with Benzoyl Peroxide, they gave me a chemical burn and my skin was painful and tortured. This mask has sulphur, no peroxice, so it&#x27;s ok to use if you can&#x27;t use their other line. No stinky smell either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few scattered tiny PMS-inspired zits to try this on, and when I removed the mask they were soft enough to just pop with the washcloth as I wiped off the mask! By the next morning they were mostly healed. I like this mask and that it didn&#x27;t dry out my face like a clay mask would. I would buy this.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Shockingly effective. I left it on longer than directed. Large, ugly cysts shrank 2/3 in size, and patches of smaller bumps disappeared completely, leaving the skin smooth. I love this product. Completely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Although previous reviews were mainly positive and the few negative ones revolved mainly around smell, not effectiveness, I looked into the science behind the use of sulfur to treat acne.  What I found encouraged me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary source I went to was an article in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, from 2004, by Aditya K. Gupta.  The gist of the article is that sulfur improves, though perhaps not cures, many skin conditions, including acne and rosacea.  Sulfur has mild antibacterial and antifungal properties.  It also forms hydrogen sulfide when applied to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trial using a lotion with 5% sulfur and 10 % sodium sulfacetamide was very effective, but note that this Proactiv+ mask doesn’t contain that second ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, sulfur doesn’t seem to cause the problems with skin irritation and uv sensitivity that many acne treatments may promote.</li>
    <li> This is not the thick clay mask that I was looking for - it&#x27;s very thin, watery and higher sulfur content.  I was (still am) looking for the Proactive thick clay mask that used to come in a similar tube however I&#x27;ve been told they replaced it with a new formula. That worked well for me in making my skin smooth and clean.  This product does not and caused a burn like allergic reaction however the good thing is because it&#x27;s so thin I just tried a tiny bit on a small area just in case.  Most all products in this line I have been sensitive to and had reactions to except the thick clay mask in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Am trying to avoid anything with microbeads (read up on the toxic plastic nightmare microbeads are creating).  Clay works fine and has for many years.  Microbeads are polluting everything including our water and food and the plastics used are known endocrine disruptors.  I&#x27;m still looking for a good non mircor bead green clay mask.</li>
    <li> Like the old version better!</li>
    <li> Came on time and as described. Item was a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermalogica products ever since my first facial appointment back in 2005.  Not only do I believe in them but I will let any individual within fifteen feet know that their line really does work.  I used to have uneven skin tone with pimple flare-ups all over my face.  After a few microdermabrasions and consistent use of that line, I no longer suffer from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard of Proactiv products while late night viewing and forced to sit through the informercials.  That is what finally piqued my interest to accept this product and see if it will stand up to my beloved Dermalogica.  Although I do not currently suffer from acne, just the occasional pimple or so, my youngest daughter is affected.  My daughter is an eleven year old that is actively going through puberty.  Recently she has been suffering from severe break outs to her forehead, chin area and severe black heads on her chin, forehead and nose.  We were applying this product for a three week period, approximately three times a week.  Over the course of time, the pimples began to fade and eventually new breakouts became very sporadic.  When there was a pimple, it would be a single one opposed to a mask on her forehead.  This skin purifying mask does nothing for blackheads (as most products don&#x27;t!) unfortunately.  I have unfortunately discarded the original packaging that the tube arrived in.  The only active ingredient listed on the back is SULFER 6%.  I would love to know if there are other additives.  I have become accustomed to and spoiled by Dermalogica&#x27;s first ingredient always being ACQUA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has helped my daughter&#x27;s face in relation to acne and a somewhat clearer complexion.  Last night before I wrote this review, I used to the mask as an overnight spot treatment for a few areas that I had picked at.  I woke up and had forgotten about it, until my kid&#x27;s questioned what the white dots were!  The Proactiv+ skin purifying mask had remained after a restless night of tossing and turning.  I felt a bit of burning on a few places and even after removal I still feel a bit of discomfort on the same locations where I had spot treated.  It did reduce the redness in a few, but did not perform a miracle.  Sadly, I cannot shake the sulfer scent off my my fingers or face.  Would I use this product again? NO!  Would I allow my daughter to use?  Yes, because it has not seemed to irritate her and has helped with the acne.  I will stick to my DERMALOGICA SEBUM CLEARING MASK.  It is a natural mask that tightens as it dries, rinses cleanly and has a wonderful organic scent.  After that mask, my face feels clean, even and tight, while my pore have been not only cleaned but refined.  This product does not have that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend only for acne sufferers!  Be aware that you might be sensitive to the sulfer.  It is recommended that you use SPF 15 when going outside after use of this product.  As I write this, my face is still burning slightly.  Luckily I do not see any indication of that on my face.  I do believe that I would see evidence of the discomfort if I continued to regularly use.  At this price, check out Dermalogica.  You will not be disappointed.  Better yet, schedule an appointment with your aesthetician and they will map your face.ht of tossing and turning.

    <li> I found this masque to be very effective in helping to clear up my minor break-outs.  It has a clay like smell, not unpleasant, with a slightly gritty, rough texture that felt good when applied.  I would definitely caution to careful to not leave it on too long, it can be very drying and would recommend applying a light moisturizer after using it.  My Daughter, who has a more widespread acne problem has also using been using it and her results from using it just twice have been remarkable, she is going to start using the full pro-active line after trying this.  We&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I think that Proactiv is one of the most, if not THE most, advertised over the counter acne treatment regimens available.  I had never tried this line before, since it was not available when I was a spotty teen girl, and my spotty teen daughter&#x27;s acne treatments are covered by our insurance.  So, when I was offered the chance to review the Proactiv + Skin Purifying Mask, I decided to take a chance, since daughter&#x27;s treatments do not include a mask, and she likes the Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tube, the mask is a pale creamy color with flecks of a slightly deeper shade.  The smell is innocuous, and more of a non-smell than anything.  The instructions say to apply to a dampened face and leave on for ten minutes (or you can use it as an overnight spot treatment).  Following the instructions, I dampen my face and apply a thin layer of the cream.  And immediately smell the aroma of rotting eggs or the sulphur springs my parents live near.  Needless to say, I was unable to keep the mask on for the recommended ten minutes-I made it just over four minutes before I could not take the smell any longer.  After rinsing, I still could smell lingering traces of sulphur, even after washing my face twice.  My hands still smelled for what seemed like hours after several washings with scented soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell, the product worked okay, providing exfoliation in the areas to which it was applied.  My husband left it on for the required ten minutes (he said it did not smell bad at all, but spent all day at a weapons range, so...), and decided that it made his skin a bit smoother, but left it feeling tight and a little itchy.  the teen daughter whom this product was supposed to be for refused to use it because &amp;#34;it stinks&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Proactiv+ has a good reputation for eliminating breakouts and also helping those suffering from acne.  And I have not had any issue with the products I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is how I felt about the Proactiv+ Skin Purifying Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is moisten your face, rub the mask and massage around your face and wait 10 minutes.  Wash away the mask and you can feel your face immediately feel smoother and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is supposed to be use around two days a week, so I chose to use it on a Monday and a Thursday because I didn&#x27;t want the skin on my face to dry up or peel, so planning on the use of the product days from each other worked effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love Proactiv+ products and it&#x27;s one that you can say, you get what you pay for.  I know for lot of people, $40 for 3 ounce tube is expensive and there are other products in the market for the same size that are under $10.  So, I can foresee this situation being the primary caveat for many consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Proactiv+ products do work and the Skin Purifying Mask does make the skin on your face feel fully cleansed.  But one will need to decide if it&#x27;s worth paying $40 for a 3 ounce tube.</li>
    <li> I have occasionally used Proactiv products over the years, especially in my 30&#x27;s as I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; oily skin.  Now, in my middle 40&#x27;s, I STILL have the occasional breakout and now have combination skin.  I have had skin sensitivity issues with products that have sulfur in them so I used this on a couple of pimples and did a &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treatment.  Boy, does this stuff WORK!  It&#x27;s potent but non-drying for me.  I have an 11 year old granddaughter who has breakouts on her forehead, nose and chin and she ALSO has very sensitive skin.  This stuff works wonders for her also!  If you use it only as an overnight spot treatment, the 3 ounces will last QUITE A LONG TIME.  Definitely WORTH the price because of the quantity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the mask as a cleansing ritual two to three times a week to refine the appearance of pores, or as a rapid response overnight spot treatment to clear emerging acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product works best for me for overnight spot treatment. The instructions on the bottle don&#x27;t explain how to do the spot treatment, but I just apply a tiny dab to the area and leave it overnight. This treatment seems to stop it from worsening, so it can start to heal. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t improve overnight, so there is still a visible mark, but not as bad as it would be without the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used as a mask, it only seems to reduce acne slightly. I don&#x27;t use it as a mask very often; maybe regular use would do more. Still, I would have expected more apparent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem when used as a mask is that it smells like sulfur. I don&#x27;t mind the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t seem very strong anyway, but if somebody didn&#x27;t like the smell it would probably be very annoying. The smell doesn&#x27;t wash off the skin very easily, and lasts the whole night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t produce stunning results, but when used as intended it does help. There are much cheaper alternatives, however. For example, Amazon sells many salicylic acid acne treatments, including blemish control apricot scrub which has worked well for me in the past. I would recommend looking into some of those.</li>
    <li> First things first: I saw little difference between the Proactiv+ Skin Purifying Mask and it&#x27;s significantly less expensive counterparts. Thus, if this wasn&#x27;t a review product, I would likely feel quite disappointed by the extra investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To explain, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for skin care products capable of shrinking nasal pores, also remove dirt/oils from skin facial surface. Florida + very sweaty workouts can wreak havoc on skin tone and complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with normal/dry skin, the Proactiv+ Skin Purifying Mask unfortunately provided almost no noticeable benefit in exception to a surface cleaning. My wife - who has the opposite skin type (oily) likewise found little difference between this and Queen Helene offerings. In fact, she deemed the latter  arguably more effective. We both complained of extreme dryness and subtle redness after recommended ten minutes of drying (then removal) time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Proactiv+ Skin Purifying Mask reminded me of another review product, that being the Bjore charcoal facial cleansing bar. Both clean...but severely dry out skin...albeit rinse easily. Perhaps others will find more to love in these as facial cleansing agents, but not in this household. Even more so at $40.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive combination skin.  Frequent travel for my job often irritates and stresses my skin and I often break out in my T-zone and sometimes oddly in the middle of my check, chest or at a certain spot on my neck or chin.  When this happens, it&#x27;s usually an angry, ugly zit that is too deep to be drained and requires a visit to a dermatologist to decrease the potential damage.  Without treatment, it often leaves a red angry spot that takes months to calm down and another few months to fade after that.  I found that using ProActive masks help prolong periods between these nasty angry blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is your basic Kaolin mask infused with peeling acids and disinfecting botanticals, texturizing agents and unfortunately fragrance.  It absorbs extra oil, plus works to shed the outer layers of dead cells to prevent and clear clogged pores.  I like to use this as a spot treatment since I mainly get random angry spots, but sometimes I use this as an area mask for my entire T-zone from my chin, nose and forehead to prevent a  breakout just after a very long trans-Pacific/Atlantic flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work to absorb the oil and to decrease pore size.  I use it as needed when traveling which is twice a week (outbound and inbound).  The recommended dosage is not more than three times a week as the face can be overly irritated by over drying and over peeling.  For travel, I put a bit in an contact lens case and keep it in my 3-1-1 baggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried this, and there is a mall with a ProActive kiosk near you, I would recommend asking for a sample to try out first.  It is a bit stronger than your drugstore/supermarket peel and mask and would be an expensive mistake if it doesn&#x27;t work out.  If it does work, then it would be worth the splurge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package was delivered I was a bit worried as it was packed in a simple padded envelope.  Upon opening the mailing envelope the product box was crushed and I was afraid that the product would have spilled and leaked.  Luckily, ProActive shrink-wraps their products before putting them into the retail box as a tamper-resistant measure that also prevents product spillage during shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a a sulfur-based acne treatment that luckily does not smell like sulphur (rotten eggs).at the product would have spilled and leaked.

    <li> My daughter suffers from ordinary teen acne. Not the cystic, horrible stuff that screams &amp;#34;find a dermatologist NOW&amp;#34; but breakouts that come and go and the occasional embarrassingly large pimple.  This is the first Proactiv item she has tried. She really likes the way her face feels after using the mask -- she said it felt refreshed and soft and using the mask was relaxing. I asked her about the smell. She said it didn&#x27;t smell particularly great, but it didn&#x27;t bother her at all, and it didn&#x27;t matter because she really liked the way her face felt after using it. She didn&#x27;t have especially good results using it as an overnight treatment, but I suspect it would have worked much better had she been able to use it as the pimple was forming instead of once it became established. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;&#x27;ll eventually get another chance to try it. I look forward to using this for a spot treatment myself.</li>
    <li> Update:  I stopped using this product because it did nothing for me, even after I continued to use it once I wrote my original review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have greasy skin. My pores get clogged with grease and that turns into pimples. Sometimes the grease gets stuck in my pores and a hard formation of grease is created. I also suffer from minor acne on my forehead and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product for the last two weeks (six applications). The only change that I noticed is that my face is not that oily as it used to be. However, there is no change in the pimples. I do still have eruptions regularly all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hopeful that as I continue using the product, I will have a better outcome with my oily face.</li>
    <li> This is a very standard clay mask with oil reducing properties. That said, the cost is outrageous considering how many clay based masks are available here on Amazon, in much more reasonable sizes and price points. I bought the kit for my teen daughter thinking she&#x27;d be more willing to care for her skin if she used the step by step system and face brush, and have used the products myself. As a cosmetologist, I&#x27;ve found many clay based masks, dead sea mud masks and even fruit acid masks that have similar oil controlling and redness reducing properties and suggest you try one of those before paying for this company&#x27;s infomercials and poor business practices.</li>
    <li> Nothing special in comparison to other acne masks. id recommend someone give it a try</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I was diagnosed with Rosacea, which can cause debilitating acne.  At age 50+, I was hoping my days of acne were long gone, but the Rosacea dashed those hopes.  Sulfur is excellent in treating the acne I get from Rosacea, and because the main ingredient in Proactive+ is sulfur, Proactive+ works great for me.  I noticed a difference the very first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, and most acne products irritate my skin.  Not so with Proactive+.  In fact, my skin feels softer and smoother than it has in a very long time.  It is quite pricey, so if other acne products work for you, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.  However, when absolutely nothing else works, this is the one to try.</li>
    <li> I used the full Proactiv system for about six months a couple of years ago when I needed a gentle overall acne treatment. It wasn&#x27;t as successful overall that I wanted so I moved on to other products but I&#x27;ve always loved the Purifying Mask and continued to buy it, even though it costs what seems like a lot for what I use it for: spot treatment. Now that I have another fourteen year-old in the throes of acne h-e-double hockey sticks, I can&#x27;t go without it in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this as a full face mask as Proactiv originally intended a few times and it didn&#x27;t really do anything. The mask doesn&#x27;t harden or even get firm and won&#x27;t give you that \\&quot;aaaaah\\&quot; feeling of having all that bad stuff being sucked out of your skin. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the appearance of my own skin and the fourteen year-old definitely didn&#x27;t. If anything, her skin looked worse for even the gentle rubbing with a washcloth. The best way to use it, in my opinion, is as an occasional spot treatment for small-to-medium whiteheads, pimples and blackheads. It doesn&#x27;t have much effect on papules but it does super things for the rest and isn&#x27;t overly drying. Yes, it actually can get rid of a small pimple or blackhead overnight! The teen kidlet finds it helpful around her hairline and nostrils where blackheads congregate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I (and now the fourteen year-old too) didn&#x27;t think the rest of the total system that much effect on my acne and while this is a great spot treatment, if you have a larger problem you may want more. If you&#x27;ve got stubborn acne, I recommend using [[ASIN:B000I7S8XG Thylox Medicated Soap Grandpa Soap Company 3.25 oz. Bar]] along with this. The double sulfur punch knocks out acne better than any benzoyl peroxide or alpha hydroxy cleanser. It&#x27;s keeping the fourteen year-old&#x27;s acne mostly under control, a miracle since I&#x27;m always nagging her to wash her face at night.</li>
    <li> There is a reason Proactiv+ is so popular, their products work and they are worth the money.  This product holds true to the quality and effectiveness the other Proactiv+ products have worked for my family in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife still gets occasional blemishes, and my teenage daughter is in her prime zit fighting years (dont tell her I said that).  They both love the Proactiv+ Skin Purifying Mask, in fact they like it so much they have already ordered another one.  It is easy to apply, works well to dry out zits and blemishes, and washes off cleanly and easily afterward.  It doesnt leave their skin red and burned looking like some other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family swears by Proactiv+ products, and this is another one of their favorites from the line.  It comes highly recommended from us.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have used the system in the past and thought it was OK to other products I have used.  The one thing I have always liked and found the most effective is the mask.  It is good to use on a weekly basis to up your game, but the thing I liked most is to use it as a spot treatment.  You can leave the mask on a blemish overnight and it really dries it out and makes it heal quicker.  That is the best part about this product and why I would continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel after using it as a mask. It feels soft and clean, although I HAVE to put a generous amount of lotion on because it&#x27;s a bit drying. It does leave me with a touch of redness, but that usually goes away within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have a big issue with acne, but I do have some ugly pore stuff going on around my nose, and this smooths it out and minimizes blackheads nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked one star off because it promises to be a good spot treatment, yet it does literally nothing in that capacity for me, my husband, or my daughter.</li>
    <li> I am using this product alone, not with other Proactiv products.  It drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel to harsh.  My pores feel and look tighter after use.  It is not overdrying, I don&#x27;t have flakiness after using.  I have used it as a spot treatment on acne as well and it seems to dry zits up overnight.  I would not say it is a miracle product that completely eliminates acne, but overall a good treatment to have in your arsenal.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv over the years and have had a lot of success with it. This skin purifying mask was no different. It cleans well and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I also noticed that when I break out around my time of the month, that any pimples that I have are greatly reduced. I like the product and plan to get more.</li>
    <li> This really is a great product.  I always make sure I have this in the house, works well if all of a sudden you get a pimple.  All you do is put in on the pimple leave it on all night and in the morning it&#x27;s gone.  Love this.</li>
