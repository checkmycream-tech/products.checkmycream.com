      <li>The green tinted cream is perfect for under makeup.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out skin, does not leave residue, feels great while washing my face and leaves it feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>, I am now using the Eucerine Hydrating facial wash which rinses clean and makes my skin feel really good.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products for my face and really nothing else works as Eucerin Redness Relief.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle and get rid if oil with iut over drying my face has been getting better</li>
      <li>A dermatologist diagnosed me with mild rosacea.</li>
      <li>It is fragrance free, and very gentle.</li>
      <li>So, I do enjoy the product, more so than many other abrasive cleansers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years now,very mild on my face,I leave it in the shower,a great cleanser.</li>
      <li>It does seem to calm my Retinol Redness.</li>
      <li>But I was surprised it does better at removing make up then Cetaphil which does nothing for removing make up.</li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and I will continue to use especially because it&#x27;s a good value in a three pack.</li>
      <li>I recently went for a facial, and she commented on how great of shape my skin was in.</li>

      <li>in all though it does feel very gentle on and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>OR if it keeps more red from coming.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far works great for my red sensitive face</li>
      <li>When I use it consistently, it doesn&#x27;t just help soothe and reduce redness from dermatitis, it seems to prevent flare-ups.  </li>
      <li>Helped at first for the redness</li>
      <li>Takes makeup off pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I have used eucerin for a long long time and my face is just beautiful</li>
      <li>I have dry sensitive skin, and Eucerin softens my skin and removes my make-up, so it&#x27;s a good combo product.</li>
      <li>Very gentle to my super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Amazon offers a very economical package of 3 which I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>so I am very particular about what I put on my face.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is nice, but it makes me break out a little.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge different in my rosacea,</li>
      <li>and my skin really cleared up since using this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle gel that is not abrasive</li>
      <li>my son &amp; have roseca, this is a gentle face wash.  </li>
      <li>I saw that Amazon had it much cheaper than Walgreens, so I stocked up (got the three tube deal).  </li>
      <li>This product is a gentle face wash that helps to keep redness under control.</li>
      <li>works very well for me.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best daily or twice daily facial cleaner for Rosacea that I have tried, and I have tried several.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s very gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I use this cleanser for several years now, it is mild, but still can remove dirt and oil from my very oily skin without irritation, although I do need to apply it twice.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it if you have rosacea!</li>
      <li>I stumbled across this product in the local CVS and fell in love with how my skin changed over the next weeks.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good Cleanser. I used it for about 2 months. Unfortunately it did not do anything about the redness. I felt that my face was cleaner after using it but the redness did not go away.</li>
    <li> I started using this product several years ago.  I read an article that as you got older, not to use the harsher cleansers - that is probably what was making my skin read and dry.  I stumbled across this product in the local CVS and fell in love with how my skin changed over the next weeks.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars b/c as much as I love the product, it is difficult to find and I can only buy it online now.  My fingers are crossed that I can buy this for years and years and years to come!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and very dry skin, I used this and my face broke out into acne and I HAVE NOT HAD ACNE since I was 16 years old. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING ever gives me oily skin or acne except this product, I am sorry I bought it, I am now using the Eucerine Hydrating facial wash which rinses clean and makes my skin feel really good.</li>
    <li> I thought I had reviewed this before, but perhaps not. At any rate, I&#x27;m 64 years old and for the past 8-10 year have had bouts with patches of red, rough skin on my cheeks. They seem to match the definitions I&#x27;ve seen of Rosacea. At the same time, I still have oily skin on my forehead, nose and chin. Cleansers that are too moisturizing inevitably lead to pimples, which is just as bad as the Rosacea! The Eucerin cleanser is wonderful; it is very gentle but still cleans thoroughly. As some have noted, it can leave your skin a bit dry, so I follow it up with the Eucerin redness-relief moisturizer on my cheeks. Since I started doing this, I&#x27;ve not had any problems with the red rough patches.</li>
    <li> Eucerin is the only product I can use on my face. I have rosacea and take a daily antibiotic. My Cleveland Clinic dermatologist highly recommended their products. I have started using their nightly face cream as well. The product came in a three pack and a very excellent price I must say. At Walgreens a single tube is often well over $10, not a good price.  I have tried so many products for my face and really nothing else works as Eucerin Redness Relief.  I will have this skin condition until the day I meet my maker so I need to make the best of it and deal with the cards I was delt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my last visit a dermatologist fellow examined me and could not believe how well I was doing. I hate the fact I will need to take an antibiotic long term, but I really think Eucerin Redness Relief makes the difference.</li>
    <li> Help to reduce redness...but you will also lose some of your eyebrow with continued use.</li>
    <li> The cleanser is awwwwwwesome!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It completely removes makeup and leaves my skin feeling soft, with no dryness that other cleansers typically leave.  I am using it in combination with the Eucerin Redness Relief lotion and the night crème, and the difference with my rosacea is amazing.  I am thrilled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years now,very mild on my face,I leave it in the shower,a great cleanser.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for roseacia (sp).  This, combined with metrogel, and Olay Sensitive Skin, works for me.  In fact, my new physician didn&#x27;t even believe I HAD a problem.</li>
    <li> This actually work it&#x27;s gentle and get rid if oil with iut over drying my face has been getting better and I can see that it&#x27;s not as red.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for awhile now, and I would never switch to anything else. I am approaching age 60, but not so long ago I would get an occasional break out. I would try different cleansers to see if they would work on my very sensitive, blotchy, acne-prone skin. The other cleansers would either cause breakouts from oil in the product, or else dry my skin terribly. When I found this cleanser, it was the answer I was looking for. Does not dry out skin, does not leave residue, feels great while washing my face and leaves it feeling clean and fresh.  I saw that Amazon had it much cheaper than Walgreens, so I stocked up (got the three tube deal).  My greatest fear is that one day they will quit making it....so I have several tubes of it stashed away.  One tube will last a long time, you only need about a nickle-sized amount to wash your face.  I just love this stuff.  I would encourage anyone to try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years with success.  Gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> There are generally two types of &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; face washes: foaming, and non-foaming. The non-foaming, like this one, wont strip the skin of moisture. When I am finished washing my face, it feels moisturized and plump. However, sometimes my face will sting if my skin is already irritated. I use chemical exfoliation (Retin-A, AHAs, BHAs, etc) which increase the sensitivity of the skin. I get a similar effect from CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, which is also a non-foaming cleanser, but the two do not have many ingredients in common. I have yet to find a non-foaming cleanser that does not sting.   The foaming &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; face washes like CeraVe Foaming Cleanser, Cetaphil, Purpose Gental Cleansing Wash, etc. do not sting, but they strip my skin a lot more. My skin will feel tight after washing if I do not apply a moisturizer right away, which is also problematic for me.    For now, I am sticking with this product. I am very happy with how moisturized it leaves my skin, and it does a pretty good job at removing makeup and dirt from my skin. I use a toner afterward, and the cotton pad never has residual makeup or dirt on it.  Cleansing: 5 stars Moisturizing: 5 stars Irritating: 4 stars &amp;#34;Redness Relief&amp;#34;: 4 stars  Total: 4.5 Stars</li>
    <li> A dermatologist diagnosed me with mild rosacea. I suppose that seems reasonable given the persistant redness on my cheeks and how my scottish pale skin seems to flush rather easily (d*mn highlander blood).I found Eucerin products here on Amazon and gave them an earnest effort; sticking to the routine of sunscreen, this cleanser and evening lotion. As far as diminishing my redness, the cleanser generally does the job for my slighly oily skin. Also, I recommend developing a slight tan too further hide one&#x27;s red tinged skin. So, I do enjoy the product, more so than many other abrasive cleansers. It has also diminished my breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and had given up ever having calm-looking skin again.  This cleanser made a HUGE difference for me.  It&#x27;s the only gentle cleanser that I&#x27;ve found that actually removes make-up.  All the other gentle cleansers that I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t completely remove make-up.  This stuff does - and it does it without irritating my sensitive skin.  Thank-you, Eucerin, for making this line of products and for making fragrance-free products.</li>
    <li> During my second pregnancy, rosacea started making an appearance on my face. It was nothing major, just some minor redness by my nose and cheeks. I am fair with normal to dry skin, and have never had problematic skin. Went to my dermatologist, and this is what she recommended. I saw results within days! I also use the redness relief daily lotion, as well as night creme, and have been for a year now. My skin is in great shape, and I always receive compliments. I recently went for a facial, and she commented on how great of shape my skin was in. I also had very minimal extractions - the least in my entire life!! I highly recommend this product. Although I do agree with another reviewer in that it is increasingly difficult to find in store. I, too, have to purchase online now.[[ASIN:B000P1S0NI Eucerin Soothing Cleanser, Redness Relief, 6.8 oz.]]</li>
    <li> Smooth and creamy. It does seem to calm my Retinol Redness.</li>
    <li> My face will dry up like the desert with soap, and I used to be convinced that one needed bubbles to be clean.  This isn&#x27;t a cream, more like a gel and it works quite well.  I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Takes makeup off pretty well.  Will have to see if it decreases facial redness.</li>
    <li> I am taking this product to Thailand for friends.  It is very popular in Thailand and it is very expensive there.</li>
    <li> Makes my face break out. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this stuff but I probably won&#x27;t rebuy. I unfortunately noticed after purchasing that there are sulfates and parabens in this cleanser which I try to avoid in my beauty and hygiene products. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge different in my rosacea, sadly nothing I have tried has helped to reduce it, not even rx creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though it does feel very gentle on and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I just wish they&#x27;d lose some of the sketchy ingredients.</li>
    <li> Very soothing facial cleanser. Easy rinse - no heavy feeling or drying. GREAT ITEM _ GREAT DEAL</li>
    <li> It is a basic cleanser but, so far, I have not seen any improvement in the redness of my skin..</li>
    <li> I have Roscea and this is an excellent cleanser and was recommended by my dermatologist. Amazon offers a very economical package of 3 which I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i like it. good price and good product. my skin improved alot after using this product. i will buy it again</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years but can no longer find it in stores. Now I get my supply through Amazon.  I have sensitive skin and other face wash cause skin irritation . This works for me,</li>
    <li> This is good for women who have a problem with redness on their face</li>
    <li> I developed a very bad case of rosacea several years ago and tried all kinds of prescription remedies, cleansers and medications. But the best cleanser that I found was this one. It is somewhat like a gel, but goes on easily. It is soap-free, as well as scent-free. One tube lasts a long while. I use this with a combination of an over-the-counter topical called Prosacea and after a short while, I didn&#x27;t need to go back to the dermatologist. My symptoms have been reduced significantly, I can partially attribute this to this cleanser. In fact, my wife uses it as well, and she has no skin blemishes or problems. She just likes the soap-free cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t leave you face dry and &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;. Great buy!</li>
    <li> A big bottle of, can be used for a long time.i will try it and see if it good for red face</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my face. I have eczema and this product made it worst. I&#x27;ve been using it as a body wash in order to give it some use.</li>
    <li> Nice cooling relief cleanser.</li>
    <li> Excellent for rosecea</li>
    <li> Any one with itchy skin give it a try</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser for several years now, it is mild, but still can remove dirt and oil from my very oily skin without irritation, although I do need to apply it twice.</li>
    <li> I used to get windburn in the winter until I started using this face wash. I have dry sensitive skin, and Eucerin softens my skin and removes my make-up, so it&#x27;s a good combo product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years and it&#x27;s my only winter face wash. (I switch in the warmer months because there&#x27;s no chance of windburn.)</li>
    <li> works very well for me.  I haven&#x27;t figured out if I like it because it reduces the redness OR if it keeps more red from coming.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, its the best for me for now at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this a couple of times now. I LOVE it. It is fragrance free, and very gentle. I have extremely sensitive skin that is&lt;br /&gt;prone to acne. I use this with my Clarisonic and have great results. This is also a great value.&lt;br /&gt;RoseVignettes@blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Great deal, great product!</li>
    <li> Helped at first for the redness but now I use it just because my face hardly ever breaks out.</li>
    <li> I suffer from Rosacea and this has become my regular face cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t really get rid of the red, but it keeps me from getting any worse and I&#x27;ll take that!</li>
    <li> This is a nice cleanser. Very gentle to my super sensitive skin. I use it once a day and African black soap once to try and combat my rosacea. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it helps.</li>
    <li> Wonderful as a hand soap in the winter if you have cracked skin on your hands and fingers... very gentle and won&#x27;t sting.  Also a great facial cleanser in the winter weather - won&#x27;t overdry your skin.</li>
    <li> So far works great for my red sensitive face</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive so I am very particular about what I put on my face. I had tried this product several years ago when my local pharmacy carried it. When I found it on Amazon I bought 3 tubes. Good product</li>
    <li> Works well for sensitive face redness and rosacea.  No need to spend an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> Used the entire content, with the night cream, did not see any improvement.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea, and everything makes my face sting when I wash it,  except this.  It was late arriving, but I&#x27;m not complaining too much about that since it actually got here.  I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding it in the local drug stores.</li>
    <li> This product is a gentle face wash that helps to keep redness under control. It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry my face.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very nice to use, cleanses well and is gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Apparently this product wasn&#x27;t seal properly.  I used it and made my face worse.  I have had to purchase a different product and used it for several days to get rid of the full faced red and blotches that I have from using this product.  I will not recommend it.  Be careful when you purchase something from here, make sure the product is secure and it has a security seal on it.</li>
    <li> Use this every time I wash my face.</li>
    <li> I use this twice per day and my face is not as red as with other products.  Plus it&#x27;s very gentle on my sensitive skin.  Works better than a lot of more expensive products at reducing redness.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different cleansers and face lotions. This has been the only product that I can use and have been using it for 5 years now. I also found the temperature of the water adds to the flare ups of rosacea too. Luke warm water is best. Adding a good moisturizer  with haver use is good too. Nothing else other than Eucerin seems to work on my skin. It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> Received with no problem&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Whether or not products like this work is a matter of each individual&#x27;s skin type, but I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s been remarkably good for me.  When I use it consistently, it doesn&#x27;t just help soothe and reduce redness from dermatitis, it seems to prevent flare-ups.  A friend with rosacea says it helps her too.  Also, a tube lasts a while--you really only need a tiny bit at a time.</li>
    <li> I would not be without this product.  I always have 2 spares so I won&#x27;t run out.  It manages my rosacea along with periodic trips to the derma.</li>
    <li> Cause my face allergy.</li>
    <li> personally, I did not like it.  My face still felt slimy after washing it off.  Only used it about 5-6 times so no idea if it helps with the redness or not.  I do however LOVE the Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Night Creme.  I&#x27;m on my second jar of that!</li>
    <li> Very thankful for this product, I&#x27;ve been buying it religiously for years now.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well for me.  There may have been a BIT of a difference, but not enough to justify the purchase.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is gentle on my Roscea and leaves my skin soft. It is perfect for taking off makeup. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Most cleaners irritate my skin and cause my psoriasis to flare. This one is gentle and also helps reduce the redness and irritation that I feel from other cleansers.  I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> my son &amp; have roseca, this is a gentle face wash.  love it</li>
    <li> This is a mild facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying 3 new products including this one, to reduce or eliminate the redness around the nose and cheeks. Using all 3, the perfecting lotion, the night cream, and this cleanser, I&#x27;m still not getting complete redness relief, probably 2 or 3 weeks now. Thought it would work better. But I do like the consistency and feel of all 3 products, particularly the jel of the cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best daily or twice daily facial cleaner for Rosacea that I have tried, and I have tried several. It does not dry out my skin at all and gives your skin a clean felling after rinsing and patting dry. It&#x27;s a gentle gel that is not abrasive and my skin really cleared up since using this product.</li>
    <li> I had rosacea for over 6 months.  I was about to go on 8 weeks of antibiotics when I tried this cleanser and the night cream as well.  My rosacea is completely gone.  My skin feels and looks soooo much better.  I got 3 tubes of this, but a little goes a long way.  The moisturizer is nice, but it makes me break out a little.  I only use it like every other day or sometimes just around the eyes and on cheeks. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best cleansing product ever. It helps my reddness from rosacea. Finally a product that really works.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it if you have rosacea!</li>
    <li> my wife loves this and uses it daily..</li>
    <li> This cleanser has a different feel to it.. It doesn&#x27;t lather and it has a ointment type consistency almost... Hard to describe.. But I was surprised it does better at removing make up then Cetaphil which does nothing for removing make up. After a few uses I got used to the consistency and I like it a lot. My skin is extremely sensitive and I will continue to use especially because it&#x27;s a good value in a three pack.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Redness Relief is a bigger help for my roseasa than prescription meds and creams.  I have used these products for years and have stopped taking using anything else.  The green tinted cream is perfect for under makeup.</li>
    <li> Ok but after using for a few weeks, face started breaking out. Allergic to everything so that is probably the problem-worked good until I became allergic to it.</li>
    <li> This is getting harder to find but it is the best product for my rosacea.  Thick, soothing, gentle and helps calm the redness.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work... At least it did nothing for me</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, and this cleanser never irritates my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a number of years, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use to wash my face at night. Takes off all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling great :) I love that I can order these products in bulk!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love eucerin products.  they are the best.  I have used eucerin for a long long time and my face is just beautiful</li>
    <li> It definitely works.  Usually my face gets very red when I wash it. This product made a difference!</li>
