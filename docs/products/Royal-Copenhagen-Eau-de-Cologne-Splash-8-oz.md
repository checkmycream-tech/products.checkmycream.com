<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have looked for this for a long time.  Love the aroma also drives women wild LOL.</li>
    <li> The product stills smells great and works fine!  No problems. I am required to add more letters to this review.</li>
    <li> My husband smells real nice</li>
    <li> I have used this product for decades. It is still as great as the first time!</li>
    <li> Using it for years good product</li>
    <li> First time buying this version of Royal Copenhagen. I like it. Has a very nice scent. FYI It is not a spray.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne before and have received positive comments, especially from my wife.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is soft and light</li>
    <li> Item was just as advertized and exactly what I have been looking for.  Can&#x27;t seem to find this product line in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> This cologne is great and if you like it try the aftershave as well. I highly recommend it and it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> All men&#x27;s fragrances smell the same these days--EXCEPT this one.  The cologne lingers for hours and is positively heavenly.  My husband has worn it for years and it seems everyone comments on it.</li>
    <li> Got this Cologne yesterday and opened it was not what I ordered at all. I have been using Royal Copenhagen for over 30 years now and have never had a problem like this. Something is really wrong either its old or something. The smell/odor is not the same. Love this Cologne and now I am stuck with an 8 oz. bottom of crap that will be going down the toilet.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the price for this amount of Royal Copenhagen, which I have bought for my husband for years from drugstores and mall stores! Fast service and perfect product, as described by the seller!</li>
    <li> Damn, this stuff smells good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for many years. This is a very good price for this size. I am not an expert, but when I opened the bottle, the perfume seemed quite fresh, so I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not quite as it used to be. I am not using.</li>
    <li> purchased for my dad for christmas - he has always used this product but i have never been able to find it for such an excellent price!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the quick turn-around.  My father was very surprised on Father&#x27;s Day!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne after doing research and reading the reviews.  Prior to my research for an affordable cologne that would not break the bank, yet still smells good, I had never heard of Royal Copenhagen.  My initial fear was it would remind me of my father, then realizing I&#x27;m from the Brute, Jade East, and English Leather generation, why not try it.  I chose the regular cologne over the musk because the musk tends to be too heavy for my tastes.  In addition, I was looking for a quality product of at least three ounces and at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read most of the reviews, made my choice and ordered the Royal Copenhagen Cologne on a Thursday.  I love the Prime program and sure enough the product was delivered the following Monday.  I was impressed with the solid protective packaging, visual design of the bottle, and great aroma of the cologne.  I tried just a very little bit and I was surprised with the fresh full aroma, but with no heaviness normally found with this type of product.  The longer I wore it the better smelling it seemed to get, light and not overbearing in any sense.  This product is one where a very little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I am very surprised and impressed with the quality, quantity, fresh aroma, excellent price and value of this cologne.  This is a \\&quot;keeper\\&quot; in my book.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne.  I have received numerous positive comments about it.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;wearing\\&quot; this perfume for years.  And I&lt;br /&gt;could not find it.  There is no other men&#x27;s fragrance around and I&#x27;m a&lt;br /&gt;woman and I LOVE IT!!!!!  Cool, refreshing, not cloying or spicy. Just&lt;br /&gt;fantastic!  I&#x27;m glad I finally found it.  Try it, whoever reads this,&lt;br /&gt;it is GREAT!!!!! A \\&quot;true\\&quot; Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Bought for gift, brother loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Been using this for many years great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Great aroma, reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this 33 years ago when I was in high school.  It was one of the cleanest, freshest colognes I had.  I don&#x27;t know what was done to it but it is now overpowering and peppery.  Too bad.  I guess I should have known with it selling kind of like gasoline.</li>
    <li> I have been using royal Copenhagen for over 30 years. I like very much</li>
    <li> This cologne is an old standard of mine. It has a light fresh just bathed fragrance. It&#x27;s a great cologne for every day or for special events. Goes well with business or party atmospheres. If you&#x27;d like a soft but memorable aroma, you should buy this cologne.</li>
    <li> Perfect cologne, perfect price.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores. Glad it&#x27;s available this way. Hope it never changes and you have a customer for a long time. thanks</li>
    <li> The bottle that was sent only smelled and looked kind of similar to genuine Royal Copenhagen.  I have used Royal Copenhagen daily and exclusively for many years---and what was sent to me was  like a watered-down version, and it rapidly evaporated.  Color was darker than the genuine bottle.  Amazon urged me to contact the seller before posting a negative review, which I tried to do, and waited four days for a reply which never came. I will not do  any further business with this seller.</li>
    <li> This cologne is so &#x27;80s, but it has an extremely unique and crisp scent.  Unlike so many of the recent scents that are much more intense but all smell the same, Royal has a sort of hard, yet, sweet, almost metallic quality that doesn&#x27;t remind one of anything else.  Nothing like its contemporaries.</li>
    <li> First has a strong scent of baby powder, then settles down into a spicy derry sweet scent</li>
    <li> not only did I get this with in 3-5 business days I got a great deal from ordering it! thank you&lt;br /&gt;Packaged amazing thank you for keeping my gift safe... its for my father who LOVES this!!!</li>
    <li> Lot of compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Plastic that cap is wrapped in wants to come off in many pieces--so that is a slight problem. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be a spray bottle.i only buy spray bottles. Of cologneroyal cophenhagen. Is a very nice smelling cologne</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne he wears.  And he wears it daily.  I bought this for him the first time in 1982 and he has been wearing it ever since.</li>
    <li> I love the cologne but hard to find anywhere even close to this price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for approx 2 decades. My last bottle included an atomizer (spray cologne)  but was the identically named Royal Copenhagen Cologne. Though this recent purchase does have a somewhat familiar scent, it is much weaker than the spray bottle I purchased several years ago. I did notice both have stickers with &#x27;Five Star Fragrance&#x27;, though with different cities. I also noticed the new bottle&#x27;s label was slightly crooked with a few air bubbles trapped behind it. It&#x27;s in the process of being returned to the helpful 3rd party seller.</li>
    <li> ROYAL COPENHAGUEN is by far, one of my selected scents since I knew about it. It&#x27;s an austere, refreshing suggestive cologne, propitious for the daily use and early evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it in case you are a ceaseless hunter of scents.</li>
    <li> Not a bad scent, but very strong and lasting.  It gets to be too much after awhile.</li>
    <li> I got this for a birthday present about 20 years ago. I&#x27;ve been using both the regular cologne and aftershave ever since.  I don&#x27;t like the musk as much, as there is a distinct difference.</li>
    <li> The chicks won&#x27;t leave me alone when I wear this.  My wife is concerned but at seventy years old I can only remember the last five minutes !!</li>
    <li> This works go for me.</li>
    <li> My husband was very pleased with his gift. And I was VERY pleased with the price, almost 85% off store prices!</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne and he wears this more than any other.  He couldn&#x27;t wait for it to be delivered and he also brought the After Shave as well.  He&#x27;s very happy!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND HAS USED ROYAL COPENHAGEN FOR AT LEAST 20 YEARS AND IT IS THE ONLY COLOGNE I LIKE TO SMELL ON HIM. HE ALWAYS GETS COMPLIMENTS ON THIS. WE LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. Great price. Great value for the money. I use it almost every day since I \\&quot;discovered it\\&quot;. The aftershave is great too. What else is there to say. Try it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> since i was young i loved it scent, my father used to use this one, and when i use it it brings me a loot of good memories, i just love it</li>
    <li> this product looks and smells the same as when i was a kid.  i haven&#x27;t used it in years so i just had to try it again, glad i did</li>
    <li> Another item that I took a gamble on. I had not seen this cologne in stores but I had heard the name tossed around before. Looking at reviews and the description, this was more in line with what I was looking for in a product.  I am tired of the generic smells I get when trying to pick out something in Macy&#x27;s. It all smells the same and over chemicalized. There&#x27;s no life, no gusto to a lot of the stuff I have come across. It&#x27;s just as important for something to smell good to me as it is for it to impress someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m terrible at picking out exact scent descriptions, however cool light spice with a touch of old school manhood is how I would describe it. I feel like a man that just worked on a car then decided to rummage in a spruce forest. Afterwards I have come back and cut up some fruit and added some spice to it , and accidentally spilled scotch on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complaint I most often see and can almost agree with - longevity.  Some days it sticks in key areas longer than others but don&#x27;t expect this to be something that stays an hour later as powerfully as you put it on. Still, it has a nice linger to it and it won&#x27;t completely disappear  throughout the day so don&#x27;t get too discouraged by it. Plus what are you doing dousing yourself in this stuff anyway? You shouldn&#x27;t be applying cologne to cover any smell up.  Are you trying to attract ants? Because that&#x27;s how you get ants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really though, a great product, great price, nice size, and it has character.</li>
    <li> While I like the price of the cologne, I found that I am sensitive to it.  I much prefer the Musk.  Still, I could not find a better price for the the large bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used it for over 40 years and have had nothing but complements .  From WOMEN.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Royal Copenhagen.  The color does not match, I think it is a knock off product</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent on my husband.  Bought it as a Christmas gift.  The price was very reasonable, especially for a scent that&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
    <li> it was great.Thank You</li>
    <li> It was what my husband of 28 yrs. was wearing when we met. And he still uses it daily, enough said!</li>
    <li> The perfume I received did not have the same strong scent as the one I purchased before from Sephora .&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good product and good price.</li>
    <li> Very nice aroma and am looking forward to wearing it on my next foray into the social world.</li>
    <li> I always get complements on this one, I&#x27;ve had it in my collection for years. 2 days and it was in my bathroom, I love Amazon Prime...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royal Copenhagen cologne only for 40+ years.  I always get compliments on the scent.  Need I say more?  I only wish that they would offer their after shave balm and face moisturizing balm again.  The best.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for almost 20 years and will continue using it. Not overpowering just a nice fragrance that I&#x27;ve received many compliments on.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells excellent! For those of ya&#x27;ll that are wondering, it&#x27;s not a spray bottle. I made the assumption that it was and ordered it. Regardless, the essence of Royal Copenhagen is very pleasing!!</li>
    <li> This scent is a classic.</li>
    <li> Was so pleased to find these as I have used them for over 50 years, very good price and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this fragrance for years and it is one of his favorites.  So keep it in your stock, because we will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> My Dad has worn Royal Copenhagen for as long as I can remember.  Recently he contacted me to say that he was unable to find it any longer.  (He lives in Florida.)  I went onto Amazon and found it right away.  While he does prefer the spray bottle he was very excited when it arrived!  Thank you Amazon for once again saving the day!</li>
    <li> I have been using Royal Copenhagen for over 30 years.  I love it and my wife does too!  I hope to never change.</li>
    <li> If I use the same fragrance every day, my fragrance enters the room a long time before I do and this works well as an every-other-day product.  The price was very a good value.</li>
    <li> I  love this cologne, been wearing it for about 30 years (maybe 40) and this is a big bottle, love the smell so I have fun using it after showers, etc.</li>
    <li> BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED</li>
    <li> Great price and size. Great seller.</li>
    <li> My friend loves this cologne.</li>
    <li> Brings back good memories of when my Grandpa used to wear this cologne. Very spicy, warm feel to it. You can&#x27;t beat 8 ounces at this price.</li>
    <li> This smell is not good. The package was terrible. Leaked all over during shipping and due to Amazon&#x27;s return policy. You cannot send it back. That&#x27;s what you get for ordering cologne over the internet.</li>
    <li> this was a present for my dad, it&#x27;s his favorite cologne and it&#x27;s hard to find at a price like this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Royal Copenhagen for years and this was the best price that I could get it at.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royal Copenhagen for the past 40 years and this is absolutely NOT Royal Copenhagen.  The smell is similar when smelling it in the bottle but remarkably different when applied.  It has a muskier smell and is nowhere near as pleasing is REAL Royal Copenhagen.  This knock-off is going down the drain because neither my wife nor I can tolerate the smell.  What a waste!</li>
    <li> Really smells good.. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. I pick my husband&#x27;s colognes and this is a favorite. Clean and fresh! Thanks for providing! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Decent cologne at a reasonable price. Its the kind you &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; on, doesn&#x27;t spray. The smell and scent of it is not my cup of tea. The aroma is that of which an older person would have on. Too much musk for my taste.</li>
    <li> Outstanding men&#x27;s cologne.  Great value for quantity, beats any departmart store or men&#x27;s shop on price.  Will come back to Amazon for future needs.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance I just wish it had a sprayer!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance!</li>
    <li> A good product at a fair price... Delivery was late by 2 days...</li>
    <li> Quite simply put, &amp;#34;It works for me.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great cologne. It&#x27;s hard to find so I was happy Amazon had it. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Dad and was surprised at how huge the bottle was! Got it for a great price and it was in super condition in the original packaging. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love that I can find this on line.  My Dad has been wearing this for as long as I can remember.  I find the fragrance just okay, but he loves it and I know where to get it for him.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Royal Copenhagen as an after-shave for more than 40 years. Tried others but this is the most pleasing to me and others who sense it on me. A pleasant, subtle clean scent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for my husband. He has used this same cologne for 40 years, ever since we were married.</li>
    <li> Super impressed with the large bottle for the price!  The only thing I was a little disappointed in is that it says &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; next to it...however it did not come in two days.  I made it by one day to make the date I needed it by for a present for my dad.  This is his favorite cologne and since I live in across the country, I love that I can go onto amazon and purchase this without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Royal Copenhagen is not available in our local stores, so it is great to be able to go online, pull it up, order it, and have it delivered within a few days. Thanks to Amazon, I didn&#x27;t have to drive 30 miles!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always wear cologne but when I do...  Been using this cologne for decades.&lt;br /&gt;Stay smelly my friends.</li>
    <li> Not an aerosol as expected</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 30 years and hope to be able to use it for 30 more.</li>
    <li> This is my dads favorite cologne! It&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores. He was so happy when he got this for his birthday!</li>
    <li> This stuff is an old &amp;#34;Stand-Buy&amp;#34; for Me  .....  Have used for 45-Years. One of My favorite Scents. Their old &amp;#34;Logo&amp;#34; was ... &amp;#34;Porcelain made for Her Majesty The Queen&amp;#34; ~or~ something to that effect if I remember correctly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and all I want to do is cuddle up with him when he&#x27;s wearing it.  Definately a girlfriend magnet!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn in Clearwater</li>
    <li> Always liked this cologne when  I use to wear it in the 80&#x27;s, but unable to buy it at the mall. Good cologne for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used this product for years. Very useful as a gift. I would like the price to be less.</li>
    <li> Royal Copenhagen By Royal Copenhagen For Men, Cologne, has been a long standing pleasing fragrance and has been used for years.</li>
    <li> We order this all the time and are always happy with it. No one sells it locally so this is our vendor of choice every time we order.</li>
    <li> The price is fantastic for 8oz.  Any size equivalent in the stores, from current cologne companies, would run you around $120. Not sure you could even find this scent in the stores, as it was popular many years back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and smell all seem to be as they were back when it was popular.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1W50U Royal Copenhagen By Royal Copenhagen For Men. Cologne Spray 3.3 Ounces]]I purchaced 2 bottles of copenhagen cologne and the fragrence is not the smell i usally get and the color of each bottle is not the same color.&lt;br /&gt;I think i got a bad batch and i want to return these bottles for new ones.&lt;br /&gt;Ive used this cologne for over 30 years and this is the first time i ever had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;How do i get in touch with this company for replacements?&lt;br /&gt;Peter Lelievre.</li>
    <li> Royal Copenhagen is the best:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Royal openhagen for over 40 years and plan to use it until I die. Its the best Cologne ever made. I tried many before I started Royal Copenhagen and none compared. The fragrence is long-lasting and I have had many compliments on the fine smell of the product.</li>
    <li> After having used Royal Copenhagen cologne for at least two decades and having purchased it from the same Amazon store for more than two years, I have to agree with some reviewers that the scent of the product received most recently is distinctly different from that of previous purchases, both online and in retail stores. I think it is still a decent product, but not up to the standards that originally drew me to use Royal Copenhagen cologne. Can anyone offer an explanation?</li>
    <li> Not as strong , but my husband says it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> sort of silly to rate what I ordered - I ordered it because I like it - duh.</li>
    <li> Upon opening I discovered that the lids were not on tight and one bottle was half empty and had leaked inside the container.</li>
    <li> Just does not seem to be the same formula as in the past. Also took a long time to receive the product but was received with no leaks as others have reported.</li>
    <li> I would consider this for anyone I got it for my father-n-law for Christmas because this is his favorite..I WAS very pleased with everything the sz the price..</li>
    <li> My father has used this brand since I can remember. I am 36 and have had this smell around all my life. I have been using it for at least 15 years now myself.  It is clean, fresh, serious, but sporty at the same time.</li>
    <li> My dad wanted this for Christmas, cause my mom used to buy it for him in the past. He loves it, and the price is better than what it was back then, so I heard.  Came on time, and in good packpaging.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this since the 1970s and I have had trouble finding it.  I was thrilled to fine it through Amazon.com and be able to include it in his stocking for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. It suits me and my chemistry and blends well with my other toiletries.</li>
    <li> I was a little upset at first because it did not have the smell that I was so accustomed too, but I figured the cold air had something to do with it. After letting the bottle warm to room temperature, this is just as fantastic as I expected. Love the subtle powdery fragrance.</li>
    <li> Could it be old?  It has a dusty smell, not fresh at all!  I think the bottle must have been sitting around for years.</li>
    <li> ran out of royal Copenhagen six years ago, retail stores stop carrying my favorite cologne.  I tried amazon, sure enough, you carried it, so from now on, anytime I need something, check with amazon. p.s.women love the fragrance------thank you--------from froggie</li>
    <li> Larger than the standard Department store size of 4 oz at a great price.</li>
    <li> got it for my son whi is only 12,wanted something that would smell nice to not strong, he loves it</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the real RC..has been remade by a licensee and they missed the mark. Weak essence. Save your money.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite &amp; mine too</li>
    <li> my favorite for 30 yrs.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product 30 yrs. ago, and liked it. I stopped because it would not last more than hour. So after all this time,I thought would give it another chance, same results. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Ok, my husband loves his cologne, however, I am not happy about the price reduction right after I received the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great choice and love the scent...so does my wife..</li>
    <li> The purchase was good.  It&#x27;s hard to find this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Purchased for an uncle. He likes it and that&#x27;Royal Copenhagens all that matters.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you buy this for the man in your life.</li>
    <li> I buy this every year for my Son and Husband for Christmas Love the smell</li>
    <li> Meet my expectations. Good for day to day activities.</li>
    <li> I love the way it spells on my husband .</li>
    <li> I bought it for an older friend that does not have internet excess and they do not sell this around here. He was very pleased!!</li>
    <li> This is not the same cologne as I have used in the past, Manufactured is ustin synthetic fragrance and has change the smell completely and did not tell anyone. Cnnot reach the manufacturer as number disconected and web site no longer exist. After many years of using royalcopenhagen I will change and never use it again. REAL RIP OFF.</li>
    <li> Every day after shaving and after using Royal Copenhagen After Shave Lotion. I&#x27;ve been using Royal Copenhagen for over&lt;br /&gt;20 years</li>
