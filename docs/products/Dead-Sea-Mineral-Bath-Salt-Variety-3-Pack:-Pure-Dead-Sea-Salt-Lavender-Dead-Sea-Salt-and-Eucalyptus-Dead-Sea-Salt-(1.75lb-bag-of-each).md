    <li> I gave the mixed package of lavender, eucalyptus, and plain Dead Sea salt to my wife for her birthday.  She is in heaven.  The bags are hefty and should be good for multiple soaks.  The aromas are good and don&#x27;t smell of perfume but smell like very pleasant natural scents.  Not a cheap seeming gift.  Very luxurious.  Attractive packaging.  I&#x27;m giving them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product</li>
    <li> I thought it would be bigger packages but this is perfect.  I used the lavender mineral sea salt ahh my ankle hurt one thing I do its take a mineral bath.  Not only is my skin is baby soft and ankle is like new.  My daughter stomach aches she wants to use it.  I am permanently living this on my list so I can keep stock of these salts always.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son and he really has enjoyed it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and the company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a gift, and I have to say it was a game changer. I had not been a bath person, but this product (a gift) swayed me big time! The benefits of Dead Sea salt are legendary, and of course I can&#x27;t prove them, but I know that as soon as I soaked in this bath water, the stress melted away. Here&#x27;s what I found on Google about why that is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The waters from the Dead Sea are unique in that they contain 27% of various salts as compared to 3% in normal sea water. Further, while sodium accounts for approximately 80% of the salt content of normal sea water, it comprises much less of the salt total in water from the Dead Sea. The balance of the salts in Dead Sea water are magnesium, potassium, calcium chloride and bromides”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Magnesium is important for both combating stress and fluid retention, slowing skin aging and calming the nervous system. Calcium is effective at preventing water retention, increasing circulation and strengthening bones and nails. Potassium energizes the body, helps to balance skin moisture and is a crucial mineral to replenish following intense exercise. Bromides act to ease muscle stiffness and relax muscles. Sodium is important for the lymphatic fluid balance (this in turn is important for immune system function). So we can see that bathing in high quality sea salt could replenish the minerals which are critical to our skin metabolism”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: attractive packaging makes this a nice gift idea!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!!!  I am already ready to buy some more.  I can&#x27;t believe I did not know this exist.</li>
    <li> Love the variety pack! Great products!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the Dead sea Mineral bath salt variety 3 pack.  Skin has taken on such a smooth and soft texture.  I fought with a ton of items to keep dead skin off of my feet, now with the continuous  use of this bath salts I do nothing other than soak and bath and no more difficulty with my dry hard heels.Lavender has become my favorite night time delight.  So soothing .  When my last 1/2 bag is finished I will be re ordering.  Minerals sure to wonders for my body and even hair, face also has benefited.  Runs around the same price as Dr. Toms Epson salt from WalMarts, I used to use but with 100 percent more benefits.  I do use a larger scoop and soak longer. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Love these salts. They smell great, dissolve completely, and I feel so good after nice bath using them.</li>
    <li> What I love about them: very reasonable prices for the large amount of product per package, incredible scents like lavender, eucalyptus and more, real muscle tension relief.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Good scent.  Great for soaking stressed out muscles and hemorrhoids in.  I will have to chekc out their other prodcts</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling bath salts.  I would like them even more if the package was bigger.</li>
    <li> My bath salt arrived timely and in perfect condition. It smells wonderful and I even got a large sample of another scented bath salt.</li>
    <li> These smell heavenly.</li>
    <li> The eucalyptus and the lavender smell great. Make your skin feel soft. Great value too!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I mix eucalyptus salt with the lavender and it&#x27;s heavenly!</li>
    <li> Soothing, lovely Bath Salts, my hubby loves them in his tub. They make his skin feel soft and he smells nice. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> People travel from all over the world to soak in the Dead Sea.  Many folks believe that the mineral content and high salinity are therapeutic.  You can have the salt and minerals come to you with these products.  These are NOT food salts.  They are for your bath.  You can add it to your bath water for a  soak, add it to your body wash and use it in the shower, put it in olive oil and rub it onto and into your skin, or just rub it directly on your body in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can obtain it scented or unscented.  This three pack lets you try three different versions and see what you enjoy most.  The crystals are large and light.  It dissolves quickly and easily, and the packaging is done thoughtfully and with care.  The scents are nice, but never overpowering.  Well, unless you are a person with sensitivity to scents; in which case just get the unscented version.  I am sure they can help you if you call them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not enjoy your bath or shower more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Saline, MI</li>
    <li> Delectable scents, dissolves quickly and is wonderful in your bath.  Note:  These are NOT Epsom Salts ... these are pure mineral bath salts.  I love these and highly recommend.</li>
