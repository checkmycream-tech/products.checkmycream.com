<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If I could give half-stars, I would rate it 4 1/2.  I only use it with the Right to Bare Lege product.  It is very smooth and silky and helps the  &amp;#34;Legs&amp;#34; product to go on evenly.  Considering how inexpensive it was, I wish I had bought more.  Shipping cost was well over the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> At 58.5 wearing bare legs to a summer wedding seemed daunting. But \\&quot;Right to Bare Legs\\&quot; let me do just that. The moisturizer is the key to a great application of product. Although I have lots of the moisturizer left I&#x27;ve read that just using any moisturizer really doesn&#x27;t give the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to keep this in my anti-aging arsenal!</li>
    <li> It covers a multitude of flaws, and the color is good, especially from a distance.  I found that it came off on everything!  I used a little on my arms, and it came off on the white table cloth at the formal dinner I attended.  Also came off all over my car door, console, etc.  My dress and shoes are colored with it, too!  The cream was really thick, so you really had to work with it.  Maybe mine was a bad batch!  Looked good, though!</li>
    <li> Leg stay soft and smooth, make it easy to use leg makeup. I would recommend this product as a foundation for corrective coverup</li>
    <li> Great comb with &amp;#34;Joan Rivers The Right to Bare Legs Corrective Cover Up&amp;#34; :)! It was the best leg make up ever!</li>
    <li> The best product for covering vains and age spots, only one draw back you have to wait for it to dry or it will rub off on your clothes, but once it does, it last all day, have used it on my arms and even my face.  Recommend this product and have purchased 3 tubes, I mix it with hand lotion to make it spread easier, maybe this is why it takes longer for it to set up, but it last, and last and covers great.</li>
    <li> I have had skin problems since age 40.  Use all dermatology suggested products.  JR lotions works well and promotes spreading of prduct.</li>
    <li> this moisturizer works great with the Right to Bare Legs self tannng. The two in combination is a must. Looks great on  legs.</li>
    <li> It has a very bad smell to it...I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very bad smell to it</li>
    <li> ...Am experiencing good&lt;br /&gt;results with the Joan Rivers products.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I would order this again.</li>
    <li> It has allowed me to bare my legs on which I have many, many spider veins; so even though I am 85 years old I still prefer not to look dowdy!  Thanks..</li>
    <li> I always use this product before applying The Right To Bare Legs.  It is creamy and makes the coverup smooth on more&lt;br /&gt;evenly.</li>
    <li> DRY AS A BONE EVERY TUBE</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and stays on all day long! I am so grateful for this product. My fair Irish skin has numerous spider veins. I tried scherotherapy....and the veins came back. This covers them really really well.</li>
    <li> This was very disappointing and made my skin itch like crazy ! I now have to go to a dermatologist for the fungus it has caused.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says, cover my spider veins, and even bruises very well. I have an iron deficiency and bruise very easily, and this helps hide those. No one wants to look like someone beat their legs just b/c their body brusies so easy. This product fixes that. You do need to wait for about 10 mins like it says on the back of the tube for it dry, but otherwise it&#x27;s wonderful and no one can tell. I have fair and it works but I am gonna try a medium one now to see if it will look like I have a tan. Reviews for that later.</li>
    <li> The Right to Bare legs does not work on dark skin people.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product as directed, but it was a waste of time&lt;br /&gt;and money.</li>
    <li> this product worked real good with joan&#x27;s bare legs color</li>
    <li> The Moisturizer really makes it all work.  It is a nice big size tube and the moisturizer disappears easily and quickly.  It really feels good putting it on your skin and then you are ready for The Right To Bare Legs.</li>
    <li> The Right to Bare Legs Moisturizer is a must-have in order for the leg cosmetic to go on correctly.  I have even used this moisturizer with other brands of concealer, and it is the magic that makes it all work.  Love it.  Have to have it.</li>
