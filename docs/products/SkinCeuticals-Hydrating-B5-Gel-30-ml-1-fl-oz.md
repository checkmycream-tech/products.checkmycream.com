<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wish it was more reasonably priced. but its good</li>
    <li> I USE THE PRODUCT EVERY DAY BEFORE THE TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream.IT IS THE BEST HYDRATING B5 PRODUCT I HAVE USED IN A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks but already notice my skin is more hydrated.  I was very pleased with how quickly the product was shipped to me and will definetly order again.</li>
    <li> I Started using this a few weeks ago and really like the skin hydration benefits. I use it an hour after my retin a and allow the B5 to set in for a few minutes and then follow with my moisturizer. I love skin ceutical products and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> It seems every time I  use this product, I break out.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is a coincidence or not, but I have very sensitive skin and mine does not seem to like this.  I will probably give it to someone I know with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love my skin on my face and I believe this product has a lot to do with it.  I go through a facial cleansing routine every morning with my skin which it positively worth the 10 to 15 minutes everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I turned 46, I am now 51, I started to buy better products for my face.  STOP buying the stuff from the grocery stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start with a light exfoliator scrub then Vitamin C Serum by Earth&#x27;s Glow (found on Amazon) with the B5 gel and finish with a moisture tint.  My skin glows and any age spots are not present and I have no wrinkles.  Now I do have to say some of that could be due to genetics.  I am Asian and many Asian people I know do not wrinkle very much with age but I know by taking care of my face it plays a huge factor in the way my face currently looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> As stated in the docs for the product, it is absorbed into the skin quickly so there is no greasy feeling. I found I can wear it It can be worn under moisturizer or alone, depending on how dry my skin feels, just as it&#x27;s directions states.

    <li> Great product. It is very light use as a base before your moisturizer. It really moisturizes deeply then with your moisturizer skin looks awesome</li>

    <li> Love SkinCeuticals! Love saving $ on their products! Product arrived on time in good, authentic, unopened condition. Recommend seller.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for your face. Everyone with dry skin should use it. The vendor was great to work with and I received my package on time!</li>
    <li> This is like having gold in a little bottle for your face.  Its amazing, the results are after just 3 days of using amazing.  I have this wrinkle that automatically goes away for a day if I use it.  When I run out of the product and use other products it returns so now I have an extra bottle just in case I can not get this product in time back.</li>
    <li> Use this and a Vitamin C moisturizer and it&#x27;s the equivalent of 500 dollar moisturizers in ingredients.</li>
    <li> i would get dry patches when using retA or dry skin. when i applied this product it moistured and softened the area. I did about 2-3 applications or as needed.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist turned me onto this product but their office charges too much for this so I was glad to be able to purchase it at a much better price than their office.  Helps moisturize but won&#x27;t bother oily or acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Watered down version of actual product.Have used this product for years but got it from the spa where I got my facials done and was fantastic.  I knew the moment I tried this product first on my hand that something wasn&#x27;t right.  It left a funny white film and felt like slimy water.  It did absolutely nothing for my skin and felt like I was rubbing slimy water on my dry areas...ick!  Also knew something was wrong because the bottle came wrapped in bubble tape with no protective seal on it.  This was a very expensive fraud!I wrote to the company asking for my money back.  Will never order from them again.  I found an excellent substitute from Peter Thomas Roth called Oilless Oil that works just the same and is so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Skin feels and looks healthier and softer.  This product locks in moisture all day. I only wish it was not in a glass bottle. Flopped in bathroom and broke and lost a lot of it.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly as it was recommended by my dermatolagist.  It feels soft and silky and seems to help hydrate my skin</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer.........It is excellent I love this product! Makes my face so soft and supple. I feel like my cheeks are a little more plump too......please always keep this product!</li>
    <li> After I put it on my face, it dried very fast. I feel water more than anything. I don&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money just put the water on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes your moisturizer work even better</li>
