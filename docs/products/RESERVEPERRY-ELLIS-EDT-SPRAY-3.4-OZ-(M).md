      <li>Highly highly recommended!!!!!</li>
      <li>Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom and all of the higher end retailers don&#x27;t sell it!!!  </li>
      <li>Very quickly delivery.</li>
      <li>nothing strong</li>
      <li>this perfume smells good brings much and cheaply</li>

      <li>This is one of my favorites Eau De Toilette, I could not get it for a while until I decided to check Amazon website, and it was available here.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and it&#x27;s got (to my nose, anyway)</li>
      <li>Cheap as dirt&lt;</li>
      <li>but if your just going on dates and don&#x27;t care to impress all day at work this is a great price and will last you quite a while assuming you don&#x27;t bathe in it</li>
      <li>I really enjoy wearing this cologne.  </li>
      <li>I must say, this cologne has a unique smell.  </li>
      <li>So I really recommend it, the fact that it&#x27;s been more than 10 years and people are still using this perfume is a proof itself.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even describe the sweet smell</li>
      <li>Sweet and tender</li>

      <li>This fragrance smells like it costs a lot more than it really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>kind of dated as far as scents go</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>All in all, a very clean smell and everyone I&#x27;ve worn it around has had very favorable comments.</li>
      <li>Light and crisp.</li>
      <li>For those who just want to smell fresh and citrusy.  </li>

      <li>I LIKE it very much.</li>
      <li>exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>smells great, complimented often, but i feel like the smell doesnt last as long as id</li>
      <li>Since trying this on the first time, this is my weapon of choice.  </li>
      <li>Plan on ordering more in the future.  </li>
      <li>This fruity but crisp fragrance can be used for all occasions.</li>
      <li>The first thing that caught my eye was the packaging.</li>
      <li>Then the bottle design, simple but stylish, and looks fab on the dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is especially good for casual evening wear when your going out for a night out.  </li>
      <li>tried to return it, and could not, but the GOOD thing about it, is that Amazon credited my account, and I ordered Perry Ellis 360 Red for the 3rd time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells good but doesn&#x27;t last for long.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So a guy walks in my barber shop wear this scent.  I&#x27;m thinking WoW, I gotta try that cause women dig guys that smell good.  So I ask him what he&#x27;s wearing.  He says Perry Ellis Reserve for Men.  So I look it up on Amazon knowing it better to go through them rather than going to a mall because the cost will be less.  So I order it.  Get it two days later through my Prime membership.  I spray it on.  It smell sooooooo good, I wanted to gobble up myself.  I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist wear I sprayed it.  Didn&#x27;t want to stop.  I can&#x27;t even describe the sweet smell but it&#x27;s not musky.  Reminds me of some kinda berries but it&#x27;s not feminine.  Everyone says it smells great.  It last a while too.  It has this tall elegant black cylinder container which is neat.  I think it&#x27;s to protect the cologne from heat or UV rays.  I know that stuff can ruin a good cologne so it good to have protection.  I have allergies and most cologne/perfumes bother my sinuses, affect my asthma, give me headaches cause I have mild multiple chemical sensitivity.  This doesn&#x27;t do any of that to me.  So I finally have something I can enjoy and recommend knowing I left a good impression wherever I went.</li>
    <li> his was a gift and my brother liked it and so do I...wears out, but I like the light stuff..nothing strong</li>
    <li> Its cologne, What is there to review?&lt;br /&gt;It smells like it should?</li>
    <li> smells great, complimented often, but i feel like the smell doesnt last as long as id like, after 3 or 4 hours it becomes very very faint</li>
    <li> This cologne is one of my favorites.  I brought this cologne after reading other reviews.  I took a chance.  I must say, this cologne has a unique smell.  I get compliments from people all the time.  I really enjoy wearing this cologne.  It is especially good for casual evening wear when your going out for a night out.  Women will definitely notice you.</li>
    <li> This Perry Ellis has a nice fregrance, but since it is a spray it makes it difficult to control the amount that is being applied.</li>
    <li> Smells like Sprite. Very citrus and perfect for the summer. Not as good as 360 red, but decent. Overall, something for the gym, or a hard days work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap as dirt&lt;br /&gt;- Nice bottle&lt;br /&gt;- Refreshing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Longevity ( 4hr&#x27;s max on my skin)&lt;br /&gt;- Sprayer wasnt that great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using perfume, only for 6 months now I guess. Perry Ellis Reserve is the 4th product that I&#x27;ve tried and I have to say that I really like it. The smell is demanding but not overwhelming, very manly. It lasts from the morning until 10pm for me, with the intensity goes down of course. So I really recommend it, the fact that it&#x27;s been more than 10 years and people are still using this perfume is a proof itself.</li>
    <li> I would say that Perry Reserve is an anytime cologne that would never get overpowering even in warmer weather. For those who just want to smell fresh and citrusy.  This is a very safe bet for anyone, even a blind buy.  ALL Perry Ellis colognes last a very long time, easily 10 hours.</li>
    <li> Great product; great price.  Why buy cologne in the retail store when you can get it off Amazon at a deep discount?</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Perry Ellis Reserve for my husband for many years but this year it was difficult for me to find it locally. I received the order fast.  A few days later my husband it used this Perry Ellis Reserve for the first time and it did not smell like his previous bottles. It smelled of a very watered down version of the Perry Ellis Reserve and yes all his previous bottles were Eau De Toilette.  It was still pleasant just not concentrated enough and after a few hours I couldn&#x27;t smell it on him at all. I&#x27;ve asked my husband to use it only while his at home and not to go out.  Very disappointed! I gave it two stars because I believe the word hate is very strong and negative.</li>
    <li> i love the scent, it is my all time favorate, perfect for a gift, has a clean smell to it</li>
    <li> this is a very good smelling product i always order perry ellis and alwys get good compliments on the way it smells on me from females</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this cologne again...great product!!!  Plan on ordering more in the future.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> this perfume smells good brings much and cheaply</li>
    <li> Nice, refined scent. This fruity but crisp fragrance can be used for all occasions.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for me as a Father&#x27;s Day gift and I liked it immediately. The scent is light and it&#x27;s got (to my nose, anyway) a subtle citrus overtone with a nice woodsy undertone. All in all, a very clean smell and everyone I&#x27;ve worn it around has had very favorable comments.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is one of my &#x27;go to&#x27; colognes. Lasts for a long time and keeps me fresh.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for a friend that loves Perry Ellis. Prompt delivery and much larger quantity than shown. Can&#x27;t wait for him to open it.</li>
    <li> My man wears this all the time. I cant keep away from him! This scent is intoxicating!!! Highly highly recommended!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Perry Ellis Reserve for years and have always bought this online. I always get a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; version, which is the exact same thing, only without the packaging, because it saves money. But when I purchased this one, it was cheaper than anywhere else PLUS it came in the original packaging which was awesome! VERY pleased!</li>
    <li> The smell is very soft and gentle. However it usually fade away after 2 3 hours. Wish it would last longer</li>
    <li> This smells amazing on my husband</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase for the money.  Will buy PE 360 next.</li>
    <li> Not as long lasting as I would like but the fragrance is very pleasant and noticeable and I LIKE it very much.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and a nice smooth transaction</li>
    <li> It smells good but doesn&#x27;t last for long.  Maybe two hours at the most then no trace.</li>
    <li> Of course he liked this gift when he opened it on his birthday because perry Ellis has the best fragrance in town for the money! 😘</li>
    <li> kind of dated as far as scents go but I keep this in my locker at work and still get compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> Light and crisp. Sweet and tender this scent will embrace the whole body. Be ready for lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this is the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn...women I know and around me just love it.  Since trying this on the first time, this is my weapon of choice.  It makes a huge difference in your dating/romantic adventures...</li>
    <li> Como siempre Perry Ellis se destaca con este perfume a un muy buen precio. 100% recomendable!!!</li>
    <li> I love the way this cologne smells on my husband but it is very hard to find. It is very affordable.</li>
    <li> Nice, great price, prompt service</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied...exactly what I ordered.  Nowhere around the Sacramento region sells this (with the exception of Perfumania at the Factory Outlets in Folsom).  Seriously....Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom and all of the higher end retailers don&#x27;t sell it!!!  Thanks for saving me a trip to the Outlets to pick this up for my hubby.  :-)</li>
    <li> I always like this brand. The 360 is my favorite but this one is also nice.</li>
    <li> I always get complimented on my perfume! I have had several folks stop me, and ask what I am wearing! My wife loves how it smells. She uses it on several occasions as well! Money well spent!</li>
    <li> GOT IT FOR MY DAD MY MOM LOVES IT</li>
    <li> Love the cologne. Very quickly delivery.</li>
    <li> This cologne was a great deal.  Two large bottles for a very good price.  My husband loves this cologne and so do I.</li>
    <li> Great item, just this time the bottle cap was missing :(</li>
    <li> I will be purchasing this one for years to come.  Be wise and invest in this cologne!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome best cologne and the first price is perfect</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It&#x27;s not very strong or overpowering.</li>
    <li> The first thing that caught my eye was the packaging. Then the bottle design, simple but stylish, and looks fab on the dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume itself is nice, striking but not overwhelming, and the fragrance lingers on for over ten hours. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for years, and I still love it. It is not too strong, especially after a half hour of putting it on, but stays lightly until the end of the work day. Would recommend to men looking for a new scent!</li>
    <li> I have used this numerous times.  The only complaint with this and other Perry Ellis colognes is that the bottles are small. They do not last that long, but they smell very well.</li>
    <li> Perry Ellis change the way the perfume smell. I will no going to order this perfume any more. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I get very good compliments on this but it is very unfortunate that it fades after about 3 hours but if your just going on dates and don&#x27;t care to impress all day at work this is a great price and will last you quite a while assuming you don&#x27;t bathe in it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother as a gift, its smells so good, when u have it on and u walk the scent just travels with u were ever u go. Its really nice, a very lovely scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using the cologne for years, and love the smell.  I often get compliments on it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order did not have the usual smell, I am not sure if the formula has changed or if what I received had gone bad.  It smelled spoiled to me.</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne love it and it is a very good price i got it very fast i would def buy stuff from here again in the near future</li>
    <li> I saw this at one of the stores at an outlet mall. They wanted $40+ and you got a deal if you ordered another one.  I do not like those silly games. I got this at a good price. It was delivered on time. What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Great product every time I purchase it.</li>
    <li> Right product... right price... delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> product as described, I like it</li>
    <li> I purchased this Perry Ellis Reserve September 13th. I have just to words to describe it,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE&amp;#34;!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it, and could not, but the GOOD thing about it, is that Amazon credited my account, and I ordered Perry Ellis 360 Red for the 3rd time.&lt;br /&gt;360 RED is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I wore it, I went to the grocery store and got 3 compliments in less than. 15 minutes. I just ordered another bottle of Perry Ellis 360 Red.&lt;br /&gt;GET IT, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> Not like the Perry Ellis that I ordered from Perry Ellis.com I think at was too old or something. One spray used to last all day, but not this bottle. so I have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase for my dad and he loved it. The price and ship time was reasonable and so was the packaging.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites Eau De Toilette, I could not get it for a while until I decided to check Amazon website, and it was available here. Well in a nut shell, my wife loves the aroma so do I. I will continue buying as long as it is fulfilled by Amazon stores.</li>
    <li> Fresh an excellent smell . I will recommended to my friends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is excellent for the summer time , it is fresh an relaxing smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIMMONS</li>
    <li> Perfect. I love this cologne for my husband.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of this cologne and my wife bought me a new bottle for my birthday.  The scent has changed and am not a big fan of it.  I won&#x27;t wear it so I have a wasted bottle.  Tried to contact Perry Ellis but have been shuffled around.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Perry Ellis 360 Black for 6 years and this isn&#x27;t 360 Black that was delievered to me, it&#x27;s either a knock off or the wrong spray. It kinda smells and look like the 360 Pearl. I am not happy and I bought 2 bottles of this!</li>
    <li> My spouse loves this cologne.  It is hard to find.  He was very satisfied.  We had no issues with it and it was what we expected to receive.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very fast, and Excellent presentation!</li>
    <li> Read all about what this should smell like but to me it&#x27;s a ladies cologne.</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells like it costs a lot more than it really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance smells to me of Anise and Cinammon.  It lasts too.  Good fragrance.</li>
    <li> good price, good product, came on time</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly and at a reasonable price.Have used this fragrance for work now for going on 2 years.Seems to be a favorite with the people at the work place</li>
    <li> I regifted this to myself while holiday shopping some years ago. I was never positive was the name of it was until I did a visual inspection of perry ellis cologne bottle on amazon. I horded my limited supply and plan on stocking up. This is MY scent, I am told.</li>
    <li> actually i&#x27;m recurring a buyer of this type of perfum and is the first time that i did not like it because it is very different from what it is supposed to be. I had to give it away, it did not smell as a regular Perry Ellis Reserve i&#x27;m used to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this kind of situation you like you&#x27;ve been stolen.</li>
    <li> Perry Ellis is great......I had not used the particular one, hence, my decision to try it.... I was not unhappy with the purchase...</li>
    <li> Smells good. Fast shipping will buy again thanks.</li>
