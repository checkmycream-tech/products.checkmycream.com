      <li>easy to work with on the eyes.</li>
      <li>This pencil is a beautiful shade and really I don&#x27;t have any complaints, but it isn&#x27;t my first choice in my makeup bag.  </li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t drag or skip across the skin, but instead leaves a solid line that, for the most part, stays in place.  </li>
      <li>I do use it, but it isn&#x27;t quite the same as some other products that I do love.  </li>
      <li>Dark black no mess easy to clean</li>
      <li>It looks so natural</li>
      <li>But I will be looking for something different in the future that hopefully stays vibrant and lasts longer!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price because it&#x27;s such a nice product and doesn&#x27;t have bad ingredients.</li>
      <li>Soft pencil but not so soft like some brands that it just pushes the tip down immediately.</li>

<li> (I actually just use this as my &#x27;base&#x27; and then use loose minerals with a flat or pointed brush to make a very dramatic 1940&#x27;s/60&#x27;s inspired line.)</li>

    <li> Great eye pencil -- I&#x27;m extremely selective about makeup brands (ingredients really do matter) and almost unreasonably picky about the intensity of the pigment when it comes to black. I like it JET BLACK. With this product, my search is over. It doesn&#x27;t drag or skip across the skin, but instead leaves a solid line that, for the most part, stays in place.  (I actually just use this as my &#x27;base&#x27; and then use loose minerals with a flat or pointed brush to make a very dramatic 1940&#x27;s/60&#x27;s inspired line.)</li>
    <li> This pencil is a great color, thank goodness for something besides black!  It is very soft though and takes a steady hand&lt;br /&gt;to use it..&lt;br /&gt;I also find that it smears easily, doesn&#x27;t seem to last well and you wind up with that slept in my make up all night look.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I would buy again...</li>
    <li> I love how you don&#x27;t have to use much, wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Smudges and wares off quickly. I like that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;healthy ingredients&amp;#34;. I like the color. But I will be looking for something different in the future that hopefully stays vibrant and lasts longer! And doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
