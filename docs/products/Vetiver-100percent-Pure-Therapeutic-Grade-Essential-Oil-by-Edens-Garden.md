      <li>I would buy it again for sure</li>
      <li>And I have heard wonderful things about essential oils</li>
      <li>I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of Edens Gardens Essential Oils.  </li>
      <li>Got to love any knowledge you didn&#x27;t already have :)</li>
      <li>Very bark-y root-y LOL</li>
      <li>Love edens garden.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I wouldn&#x27;t be able to describe why it works, it just does.</li>
      <li>oils!&lt;br /&gt;I got this oil because it sounded more manly smelling</li>
      <li>Glad to have this pleasing scented oil</li>
      <li>I love all of the oils from Edens Garden.  </li>
      <li>I like them better than Aura Cacia, and they are significantly more economical, since you&#x27;re not paying for branding.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;(you also get a free complimentary leaflet with some combinations of oils and how to make your own blends)</li>
      <li>/&gt;The oil is very strongly scented and brings to mind the scent of fresh cut wood, or of wood that&#x27;s been in the fireplace.</li>
      <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Vetiver is super stinky!</li>
      <li>So happy I can find any essential oils I need on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is definitely the most powerful Vetiver I have experienced.</li>
      <li>These are always fresh and top</li>
      <li>Always fantastic and quality products.</li>
      <li>The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous.</li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>Just a few drops are all that you need -Any where you have wood you can revive with vetiver oil- very nice scent !!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many different ones from Edens Garden and have loved them all.</li>
      <li>There is something about the clean scent of wood that I enjoy -</li>
      <li>I thought it was super strong - and so did he.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m familiar with in mens&#x27; cologne</li>
      <li>They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and how fast it shipped.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE Edens Gardens oils and highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>Sweet, spicey, earthy, smoky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve liked Vetiver so far.</li>
      <li>However, if you don&#x27;t care about the smell and just want something to help calm tantrums, fits, rages, insomnia...this is very worth a try.  </li>
      <li>First, let me say the smell is a very manly, earthy smell, very strong.  </li>
      <li>This most likely isn&#x27;t appropriate for a warmer.  </li>
      <li>I love most of the oil scents and use them differently, vetiver oil I use on cedar blocks and put them in my closet and attic</li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>Am very pleased with all the essential oils I have purchased from Edens Garden.</li>
      <li>Surprising how a bottle lasts so long.</li>
      <li>I agree with the many other consumers that have stated that the smell is strong!</li>
      <li>Combine with Valerian for a powerful relaxant.  </li>
      <li>For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly (within a week), and was packaged exceptionally well: in bubble wrap and in a small padded envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>very pure</li>
      <li>Quality product (therapeutic grade), fast shipping and much better value than most other suppliers.</li>
      <li>My favorite essential oil.  </li>
      <li>I love all eden&#x27;s garden essential</li>
      <li>The oil arrived on time and is exactly what I wanted...</li>
      <li>One of my favorite brands of essential oils.</li>
      <li>First time to purchase vetiver.</li>
      <li>Vetiver is one of my favorite essential oils.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work, even from the first time I used</li>
      <li>These are much cheaper than doterra and since I&#x27;m not ingesting them therapeutic grade works for me!</li>
      <li>I love Edens Garden Essential Oils!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands of essential oils for use in homemade bath products and as room fragrances, and I really like this manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>I purchased vetiver wanting a very woody scent, and this certainly delivers.</li>
      <li>Product arrived fast and it is pure.</li>
      <li>Very earthy and relaxing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to really have to play with mixing it.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this product after much research regarding it&#x27;s therapeutic uses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pretty good a little different than I am used to with doterra</li>
    <li> Recommend Edens Garden to all!  Product arrived fast and it is pure. EG added 101 ways to use #&#x27;s of oils. Got to love any knowledge you didn&#x27;t already have :)</li>
    <li> I love Edens Garden! I&#x27;ve not been disappointed with any of their products. I&#x27;ve liked Vetiver so far. Been sharing with my daughter, and she loves it too!!!</li>
    <li> Smell is awful. And I have heard wonderful things about essential oils so I gave it a try for my 8 year old who is combined type ADD/ADHD and was previously on Ritalin, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t help him so we started him on a different medication that has made him a different child in the classroom. But every person/child is different so the only thing to do is try until you find the right thing for your situation.</li>
    <li> Happy with my oil, cannot wait to add more.</li>
    <li> Like this product. Am very pleased with all the essential oils I have purchased from Edens Garden.</li>
    <li> I love most of the oil scents and use them differently, vetiver oil I use on cedar blocks and put them in my closet and attic Just a few drops are all that you need -Any where you have wood you can revive with vetiver oil- very nice scent !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather new to the different essential oils out there, but there are some I buy merely for their scent. I purchased vetiver wanting a very woody scent, and this certainly delivers. Having no experience with vetiver outside of this, I can only describe it&#x27;s qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is very strongly scented and brings to mind the scent of fresh cut wood, or of wood that&#x27;s been in the fireplace. I have some stained wooden boxes I made years ago that have lost their woody scent, and it&#x27;s this that I intended to use the oil for. There is something about the clean scent of wood that I enjoy - what can I say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil came with tips for different ways of utilizing the different essential oils, and has a dropper top seal on the brown glass bottle.  I&#x27;ll be looking at some of their other oils as well.</li>
    <li> The oil seemed like it was high quality, but I did not enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> I have a large collection of perfumes of high quality and I find that vetiver is in lots of my favorites. I like natural smelling perfumes that remind me of the woods and nature.&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver has that grassy woodsy scent I crave. I have over two dozen of these oils from&lt;br /&gt;this company and prefer them to other brands which sometimes have an off or rancid quality. These are always fresh and top quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put these in my bath water, disperse them in oil warmers, and mix my own perfume blends with my favorite oils. This one goes nicely with juniper berry essential oil and bergamot, two other woodsy earthy scents. Try getting an assortment of these oils and experimenting with different mixes of them to find your own personal scent that lifts your mood, clears your mind and relaxes your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver is one of the great woodsy scented oils, in addition to rosewood, sandlewood,&lt;br /&gt;cedarwood and bergamot. Try using combinations of these in your oil burners for a delicious naturally woods scented home.</li>
    <li> I love Edens Garden Essential Oils!  This oil was purchased for my son&#x27;s ADHD.  We homeschool and I can diffuse, so I bought it to try out. We have only used it once so far in the diffuser.  I have used it twice in my own bath, and it is very nice.  First, let me say the smell is a very manly, earthy smell, very strong.  Literally one drop is all you need in an entire bath!  I just read about warming up the bottle in your hands or using a tooth pick to try and get it out.  For me, I popped off the dropper lid, and used the end of the dropper to dip and drip one drop off.  VERY thick and will not come out of the dropper like normal.  I look forward to trying this out in the diffuser more to see the benefits with the ADHD.</li>
    <li> The bottle was empty when I went to use it.</li>
    <li> thanks, great product</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - I mix it in fractionated coconut oil and add in some lavender EO. I dab a bit on my toe and the balls of my feet before bed - extremely relaxing and seems to be helping my insomnia. Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> In comparing to other Vetiver Essential Oils.........this is not what I expected.  This is like the bottom of the barrel of oils.</li>
    <li> Smells great!!  I am using it in homemade items like body butters, chopsticks, deodorants and shower fizzies!!!</li>
    <li> Always fantastic and quality products.</li>
    <li> Very thick!  Difficult to get drops into diffuser.</li>
    <li> I use it for calming and grounding for my daughter who has sensory issues.  I place it on her feet and put it on the inside of her wrist and by her head on the bed.  It seems to work, even from the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wouldn&#x27;t be able to describe why it works, it just does.</li>
    <li> Is there anyway to know if the Vetiver is an absolute or essential oil? Mislabeled products, mislabeled websites, uninformed and unknowledgable staff! Lots of wasted money on products that were misrepresented!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of essential oils for use in homemade bath products and as room fragrances, and I really like this manufacturer.  The oils don&#x27;t seem diluted, the smell lingers for a long time and they don&#x27;t irritate the skin or eyes.  I am very pleased with this purchase, and I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> My son is active and doesn&#x27;t concentrate in school. So I bought him this to concentrate. He loves that I massage his feet with it and coconut oil along with ceded wood and lavender.&lt;br /&gt;He also laughs as we joke that it smells like BBQ!! Smoky and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;We put it along other the other oils I mentioned in a lip balm and now he can apply it in school without breaking the glass bottle or getting it taken away.&lt;br /&gt;Since we&#x27;ve been applying oils, praying, talking with him about focusing in school his marks have improved for the last three weeks! He&#x27;s still really active, gets bored easily, and finds it hard to pay attention at times at home...but we will keep working on it and let his body absorb it more.&lt;br /&gt;(I think I should mention that at first I only applied lavender for a few weeks. I don&#x27;t see a difference after adding vetiver and cedar wood yet. But studies showed the biggest difference in brainwave activity with vetiver. So I&#x27;m trying it!)&lt;br /&gt;I know I feel really tired after applying them at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of Vetiver and this is one of the worst!  It smells like gross smoked meat..  I can&#x27;t even use it.  Also, the color is very dark like molasses.  All of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried were a light amber color.  I&#x27;m a fan of other Eden Gardens oils, but not this one!  Guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> The Ventiver I ordered was more oil for the price of similar offers, which is why I opted for this one. When it arrived, some had leaked out. I did not see the ring under the cap which is usually attached to the cap, either. It appears to be an older bottle with a white cap. After further inspection, it did not look like there was a locking ring to begin with on this one. For me, lesson learned! Will buy oils now from a local shop.</li>
    <li> I rub some this stuff on my arm at first, it smells very concentrated, so concentrated that you think i&#x27;s not vetiver, but on your skin this stuff airs out a little and it smells great!  very pure</li>
    <li> The oil arrived on time and is exactly what I wanted...EXCEPT the oil does not drip from the bottle like it&#x27;s supposed to. I  have to take the top off and use a small dropper to get it out.</li>
    <li> I love all eden&#x27;s garden essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;I got this oil because it sounded more manly smelling&lt;br /&gt;than the others I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has anxiety and concentration issues&lt;br /&gt;and this seems to help!</li>
    <li> not what i expected at all! oopsie.</li>
    <li> i use this oil in my relaxation and bedtime blends.  it is very nice.  super thick consistency so using a dropper isn&#x27;t even necessary.  i love the earthy, grounding scent.  will buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if perhaps it&#x27;s this brand, or what...  I&#x27;ve heard about this being tranquil and earthy, woodsy, with a little smokey masculine tone... but WHOAH!  This smell just like a campfire with some type of salty marinated animal cooking on it.  I REALLY love woodsy, cedar-ish smells... but this is like liquid smoke.  I&#x27;m going to really have to play with mixing it.  Maybe something really sweet will turn this into something awesome, but just so you know, if you&#x27;ve never smelled vetiver, this stuff is a lot more smokey than woodsy.</li>
    <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle... it seems thicker than others.</li>
    <li> Good quality oils, fast delivery, very pleased with this company, will order again from Edens Garden :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(you also get a free complimentary leaflet with some combinations of oils and how to make your own blends)</li>
    <li> Vetiver is like the kid you made fun of in middle school who turned out to be a millionaire one day. The scent is dark earthy and a bit bitter, but compliments many other oils in concoctions. It is a good base note smell with a dark chocolate type of sweetness.</li>
    <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
    <li> Love edens garden. quality oils at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and works great for my deodorant that i make.</li>
    <li> Glad to have this pleasing scented oil</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of Edens Gardens Essential Oils.  They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
    <li> I feel like this is good stuff.  I have not used this before but I believe it will help me.</li>
    <li> Very strong but relaxing</li>
    <li> My favorite essential oil.  I&#x27;ve ordered this oil from other places, but keep coming back to Edens Garden because of the quality.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and has a very earthy, grounding yet attractive scent and is a quality product!  I absolutely LOVE Edens Gardens oils and highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Great Vetiver. Sweet, spicey, earthy, smoky. This oil will be a good addition to many bodycare products and perfume blending Well packaged timely delivery</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how fast it shipped.  Price is pleasing too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dog to learn the scent for the dog sport of Nosework.  It&#x27;s working well:  my dog is learning!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite brands of essential oils. I&#x27;ve bought many different ones from Edens Garden and have loved them all.</li>
    <li> Its a little hard to get used to the smell at first but good once you do.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes to get some sleep, and didn&#x27;t. It stinks too. It may work for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; people, however I recently learned that I have a high cortisol level in the eve and early morning. That&#x27;s probably why it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden oils, as a rule, are excellent.  I like them better than Aura Cacia, and they are significantly more economical, since you&#x27;re not paying for branding.  This company deserves your business if you are into Aromatherapy, fragrance blending, soap making etc.  you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> just started will update</li>
    <li> Vetiver is one of my favorite essential oils.  So happy I can find any essential oils I need on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to perfumes &amp; colognes...my husband wears this &amp; it smells so masculine &amp; woodsy &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze. Haven&#x27;t tried in my essential oil diffuser yet.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful! It is definitely the most powerful Vetiver I have experienced. A little goes a long way. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Would buy it again. recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after much research regarding it&#x27;s therapeutic uses. It arrived very quickly (within a week), and was packaged exceptionally well: in bubble wrap and in a small padded envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this product is definitely acquired:  It has a very raw undertone that is somewhat woody.  This most likely isn&#x27;t appropriate for a warmer.  The product is very thick, and the color of molasses.  Also, as a precautionary note, this product can be very harmful to cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is likely unfair that I am rating this product a 4, as I received wonderful service.  I took off one star (sorry) because I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  (Personal preference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use the product - - and I will use this vendor again!</li>
    <li> Great, i actually love the smell. It is very thick though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 5-star rating because there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the oil... it&#x27;s just not the smell for me. I bought it on a whim because it is good for calming and grounding. It may be. I just can&#x27;t get past the smell long enough to experience those sensations. Personally, I think vetiver smells like a wet ashtray. Had I known that I abhor the smell of vetiver I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. I&#x27;ve bought many of the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils that I absolutely love. Just not this one.</li>
    <li> Well...it reeks. However, if you don&#x27;t care about the smell and just want something to help calm tantrums, fits, rages, insomnia...this is very worth a try.  It is surprisingly thicker even than doterras vetiver, and I have tried both, and surprisingly more potent.  I did have to take out the stopper to get it to drip out, as it is too thick otherwise.  Combine with Valerian for a powerful relaxant.  This combo works for my husbands psychosis that he refuses to take medication for.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden is the way to go.  Quality product (therapeutic grade), fast shipping and much better value than most other suppliers.</li>
    <li> Not the Vetiver I&#x27;m familiar with in mens&#x27; cologne so I was a little disappointed. Very bark-y root-y LOL</li>
    <li> I am waiting for my order to arrive, but found that my mom in law used this product and loved it. I hope to become a continuous client, as I do healing tinctures... and parfumes for the body and overall well being.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this seller and their products, which are Pure, grown and harvested in the old ways. I am so eager to try mine for a medicinal need that has been bothering a friend for a long while, this herbal oil blended withn certain others... should bring her permanent relief she has sought for years.&lt;br /&gt;Author~Artist, Artist~Photographer, Actress~Producer, Holistic Medicine Woman~Master Gardener,&lt;br /&gt;Jewel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If you are given talents, use them for the good of God and man... do not waste a single one.

    <li> To pungent. Not a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I use this for my 7 year old that suffers from extreme anxiety - the first time I smelled it I thought it was super strong - and so did he.  But after the 3rd application we both like it - alot.  We use it in conjunction with Cedarwood and Lavender - after a few weeks of semi regular use I think my little one is feeling better.  I would buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> Edens Garden is great!!  Vetiver is super stinky! Recommended by a friend as a sleep aid, but way too stinky to even be in the same room with.  Love my other products from Edens Garden.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I&#x27;m newly addicted to essential oils, mostly to make beauty products...creams, deodorants and some aromatherapy. These are much cheaper than doterra and since I&#x27;m not ingesting them therapeutic grade works for me!</li>
    <li> I agree with the many other consumers that have stated that the smell is strong! I purchased this because I researched that this, along with Lavender and Cedarwood, are good for children that may have ADHD or the symptoms there of. I have not seen a huge difference in my wild and precocious 4 year old, but it has only been a few days. I am not giving up, because I&#x27;ll be damned if my gremlin goes on medication!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this oil!! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love all of the oils from Edens Garden.  Surprising how a bottle lasts so long.</li>
    <li> More than expectation!!!</li>
    <li> First time to purchase vetiver. It has grown on me. Very earthy and relaxing.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant</li>
