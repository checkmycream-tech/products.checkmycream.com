### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>For my hair, the Tea Tree works the best.</li>
      <li>I purchased the &amp;#34;Fig&amp;#34; by WEN and I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as I was with this product.</li>
      <li>I do believe this is the best version of WEN for my hair.</li>
      <li>Wen cleansing coniditioner is the best product i have used for cleansing my hair.  </li>
      <li>Another thing I love is when I get out of the shower and comb my hair - NO SNARLS!!!!</li>
      <li>BEST thing about this conditioner is how your scalp tingles as you rub it all in.</li>
      <li>When I found this on Amazon I was so happy!</li>
      <li>Happy Wenning!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is amazing!!</li>
      <li>Have been using it for two months now, and except fot he cost, I find it to be a very good product.</li>
      <li>This is a very good product when coloring your hair, as it gets out the colorant without harming your color.  </li>
      <li>And it works great for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
      <li>BUT I am happy I purchased this</li>
      <li>but it works great.</li>
      <li>I also like the L&#x27;Oreal product, and think it  is a great \\&quot;compromise.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>It is a great hair conditioner.</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>Also, the Tea Tree scent is very strong, and smells like Pine-Sol (Great for floors, not so great for hair!)</li>
      <li>(I went 8 mins just to be sure that it soaks in real good)..</li>
      <li>Great product at a good price.  </li>
      <li>It still works great and leaves my hair amazing though.</li>
      <li>It is a good product and i would use it</li>
      <li>This product is good</li>
      <li>When I saw my friend&#x27;s Wen in her shower, I laughed.</li>
      <li>Good smell to conditioner.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because i bought into the hype that it was great for my hair, and healthy.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how healthy my hair looked after one use!</li>
      <li>On top of that, it smelled rancid and looked diluted!  </li>
      <li>WEN is amazing.</li>
      <li>Thus, it might be cost effective for me.</li>
      <li>It contains some kind of wax, because it coated both my hair and my scalp.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shipped really quickly,&lt;br /&gt;package was excellent</li>
      <li>It is nice to use this a couple times a week though.</li>
      <li>So far, I am quite impressed.</li>
      <li>It has body and looks thicker in general, and the best part is that it seems to help my nails grow as well-added bonus!  </li>
      <li>Hair and scalp do feel nice, and it is a good product, but would never spring for the large bottle.</li>
      <li>love the smell</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use nearly as many pumps as they say to use, so</li>
      <li>I love Wen.  </li>
      <li>It keeps it moisturized for sure.</li>
      <li>Now my hair looks fuller, feels softer and my scalp is in better shape.</li>
      <li>I will stick to my fairy tales rosemary shampoo which is natural/ organic and works great and is much lighter on my pocket.</li>
      <li>used it 3 times and it was just okay</li>
      <li>It is okay product.....</li>
      <li>No chemicals and makes your hair better over time.</li>
      <li>I have bought many thing from watching infomercials..</li>
      <li>Thank you and Enjoy!</li>
      <li>rather use Treseme moist conditioner instead and get better results.</li>
      <li>Unless you just love throwing your money away for a product that does not deliver on any of its promises, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
      <li>but I love it</li>
      <li>Okay so I got this WEN cleaning conditioner to see how it would respond to my hair.</li>
      <li>I love the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>After using the Tea Tree  my scalp is healthy.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>my hair has never been more healthy</li>
      <li>hair has never felt softer,looked more healthy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE all of the Wen products, however the Tea Tree is definitely not the best scent for me.</li>
      <li>tried one more time and ordered 1 16 oz.</li>
      <li>I love Wen products.</li>
      <li>But I love cucumber aloe and fig.</li>
      <li>You will love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, unruly hair responded and looked better than usual.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I clarify many of my clients before I even give them a haircut-</li>
      <li>UPDATE: Ordered and used the Fig- love it even more.</li>
      <li>I use as many products with Tea Tree in them as I am a diabetic.</li>
      <li>My hair started really growing after I started using Wen Tea Tree.. Love it !!</li>
      <li>so the flat iron is my best friend.  </li>
      <li>And it seems to stay nice and fresh looking longer between washes, too.</li>
      <li>However, it does not leave the hair anything except soft and shiny, very nice result.</li>
      <li>but its not painful or itchy at all!  </li>
      <li>This is really easy just rinse hair with water for 1 minute, apply as directed and rinse.  </li>
      <li>so I figured the product was probably too strong for their hair type and decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>So, this product worked just fine for that.</li>
      <li>What a pleasant surprise after just one use my hair is soft, shiny and the dryness is gone.</li>
      <li>After rinsing and hopping out of the hot shower, my scalp and neck were still tingling and it felt sooo clean and nice.</li>
      <li>It does clean my hair nicely on the first wash, but I can&#x27;t use it two days in a row.</li>
      <li>I started using only Wen products at home about a year ago, and I am happy with them.</li>
      <li>Initially, even though it styled great, i was leery about build up.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the smell though and use it as a leave in conditioner sometimes.</li>
      <li>However, I have gotten a few \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; things that have been wonderful.</li>
      <li>This is so gentle and gives amazing body</li>
      <li>I did not see any great difference between Hair One and a regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>My hair is natural now and this feels so good going through it.</li>
      <li>end.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is true tea tree, so it is strong.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the scent, but it did seem to do a nice job for my hair.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s unique smell.</li>
      <li>I had to still use my special shampoo seperate for that which dries out my hair.</li>
      <li>and boy were they right!</li>
      <li>I have thick curly hair, the perfect profile for this product</li>
      <li>It was not as aromatic as the Sweet Almond and the results does not warrant the price.</li>
      <li>Very Impressed to say the least.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Sweet Almond Mint, Pomegranate, Fig, Cucumber Aloe, and Tea Tree.</li>
      <li>Along with my hair is now lovely and soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>But other than that I believe it is a great product.</li>
      <li>Using as many pumps as it suggests would use this bottle up in about two shampoos, so again, not very cost effective.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t cry if I couldn&#x27;t ever buy it again, but if I can find it at a decent price, I&#x27;ll probably buy more.</li>
      <li>my scalp felt more clean from this stuff than a shampoo ever did, yet, my hair was so soft and bouncy!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair started really growing after I started using Wen Tea Tree.. Love it !!</li>
    <li> I have used WEN before in the past and it made my hair so much better. When I no longer could afford it I switched to the cheaper alternatives with no avail. They just didn&#x27;t do as much for my hair as WEN has done. When I found this on Amazon I was so happy! I could actually afford it and was pleased with how quickly it came. When I first used it my hair was very silky and soft. My hair with the sweet almond mint version took longer to get that same result. This did it the first time. I do believe this is the best version of WEN for my hair. I would highly recommend this to anyone with dry, thick, curly, frizzy hair like mine. You will be amazed with your results!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product.  After using the product, and blow drying my hair, I did not like the end result.  It took a long time to actually dry, and it still looked wet and greasy.  I would not recommend WEN Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Was not good for me, had a medicine  smell to it that lingered in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, shoulder length highlighted hair.  I usually stop highlights in the winter because my hair gets to dry and damaged, but I may not have to.  After using this once, I could feel and see the difference in my hair.  It is actually shiny and soft.  It took less time to blow dry, straighten and I didn&#x27;t need to use any products to tame my frizzes cause there wasn&#x27;t any!! If you have hair like mine and you are scared to try it...don&#x27;t be.  I would pick a scent that you will like, cause it is a little overwhelming.  [[ASIN:B0006Q0HEC WEN® Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]</li>
    <li> Hopeful and skeptical after watching the infomercials.  Followed directions and used the product for about 2 weeks. Left my hair looking greasy and feeling like I didn&#x27;t rinse it out at all. Read previous reviews from people with thin hair so I figured the product was probably too strong for their hair type and decided to give it a try.  I have very thick, wavy, mid length hair which is frizzy after blow drying and if I air dry it&#x27;s too full so the flat iron is my best friend.  This product made my hair feel soft but it didn&#x27;t reduce frizz or cut down on drying/styling time.  Maybe I&#x27;ll use the little that&#x27;s left as a once a week conditioner instead.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this product at all! It didn&#x27;t do anything that this line claimed for my curly hair. It was still frizzy and the texture did not improve, and I even used it to the last drop just to be sure. Save yourself the trouble and money...DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have moderately fine hair and dry scalp.  I discovered tea tree shampoos and conditioners several years ago, and won&#x27;t use anything else because they work so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my first Wen products as a result of a TV offer, and got the Almond Mint because I didn&#x27;t have a choice. I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the scent, but it did seem to do a nice job for my hair.  However, just recently, I bought the Tea Tree, and that did the trick. So, if you&#x27;re going to buy this, look at the different ones and see if they&#x27;re formulated for the kind of hair and scalp you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Yes, but for me, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be all that much better than my other tea tree shampoo and conditioner.  The main thing I like is having the shampoo and conditioner all in one, so it cuts down on my hair washing and conditioning time. My hair does appear to be a bit softer and shinier, but not so much so that I&#x27;m wowed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to getting it cheaper is to buy the bigger bottles. The price per oz. goes way down if you get the 32oz. It still costs more than most normal shampoos and conditioners, but it isn&#x27;t as horrible if you buy the bigger size.  For instance, I bought a 32oz bottle on eBay for $58, which included shipping.  That made it about $1.81 an oz. On Amazon, if you buy the 16oz from one particular seller, with shipping, it&#x27;ll cost you $2.55 an oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other price factors include how you use it, and how often you use it.  I have very short hair, and I wash it once a week. I don&#x27;t use nearly as many pumps as they say to use, so I&#x27;m probably going to make it last a very long time. Thus, it might be cost effective for me. If I had long hair and washed it several times a week, I definitely couldn&#x27;t afford to continue with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I continue using Wen once I run out?  I wouldn&#x27;t cry if I couldn&#x27;t ever buy it again, but if I can find it at a decent price, I&#x27;ll probably buy more.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.  I use this product often.  It really does work well and helps to revitalize and replenish your hair.  I would highly recommend this product.  It is expensive, so I often shop Amazon and Ebay for deals.  Thank you and Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Wen Tea Tree cleansing conditioner after previously using Hair One (a \\&quot;generic\\&quot; Wen sold at Sally Beauty and Amazon) and the new L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme cleansing conditioner, so I will mention all three products in this review. The pluses for Wen:  it made my hair softer than either Hair One or L&#x27;Oreal, or any other traditional shampoo I have ever used.  I take a medication that causes hair loss and brittle hair as a side effect, and every day I almost cry at the amount of hair in my shower drain.  There was definitely less hairs in the shower with the Wen.  I think that is because Wen makes your hair easy to comb, and since you \\&quot;comb thru\\&quot; the Wen while in the shower, it is much easier to comb when you are done.  I also noticed my hair looked alot shinnier using Wen.  I went two days between shampoos, and by the 2nd day my hair felt a little greasy, but was still very easy to comb and style.  The negatives with Wen:  you need to use ALOT ( the bottle says 20-30 pumps), and it takes forever to rinse out. I am going to cut back on the amount I use and see how that works. Also, the Tea Tree scent is very strong, and smells like Pine-Sol (Great for floors, not so great for hair!) I think the higher price for Wen compared to Hair One is worth it- I did not see any great difference between Hair One and a regular shampoo. I also like the L&#x27;Oreal product, and think it  is a great \\&quot;compromise.\\&quot;  Unlike Wen or Hair One, L&#x27;Oreal is a \\&quot;low sudsing\\&quot; shampoo (with Wen or Hair One there are no suds and that is a little strange at first).  The L&#x27;Oreal is very creamy, and the scent is nice, but my hair did not feel nearly as soft as with the Wen, and I did use a small amount of conditioner after.  I will probably rotate between Wen and L&#x27;Oreal. If you have problem hair-dry, brittle, hair loss, I think Wen is worth it. If you have healty hair, or just want to try a \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot; try the L&#x27;Oreal product first</li>
    <li> I gave it 1 star for effort, and well because they don&#x27;t offer negative rating. I bought this product because I have long hair (down to my elbows) that I have been growing out now for 5 years; after years of doing a ton of damage to my hair in my youth (coloring almost every shade under the sun, and perming then straightening, etc.) I don&#x27;t let any harsh chemicals go near my hair now... no dyes, perms, etc. i wash my hair every other day. i only comb when wet, brush when dry. let it air dry as often as possible, and only pull out the blow dryer and curling irons for special occasions. my hair is oily/normal combo, naturally wavy, dark blonde, and thick. I purchased this product because i bought into the hype that it was great for my hair, and healthy. I was wrong, first of all it recommends that you use 15-20 pumps, if you go by the recommendation you would use up the entire bottle in 3 washings! it smells like menthol chapstick, and started to make my eyes water while I waited around with the goop on my head for a solid 5 mins (I went 8 mins just to be sure that it soaks in real good).. no big deal, so long as the product works right? -- wrong... It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything different to my hair, I put in a half of a full pump as a leave in conditioner (a full pump is way too much product for me) even with half a pump my hair felt barely degreased at my roots and limp/and sticky at my ends (where i focused the leave in conditioner)... I didn&#x27;t like the product i thought it was a waste of hard earned money... i don&#x27;t have the slightest idea of why it has to be so expensive. but seeing as how i spent the money i was determined to use the product, so i tried it out for a 2nd time... no go... same results, only this time i was throughly irritated... its been sitting in my shower for 2 months now and i just can&#x27;t bring myself to use it again... maybe this product will work on badly damaged hair... but if you have healthy hair and want to use this product in your normal routine then please do not waste your money on this.routine then please do not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I have a hard time finding products that work on fine and thin hair. This product is good but I didn&#x27;t find it that much different than other cleansers. I gave it five stars because I think it&#x27;s worth the price but it&#x27;s not a miracle product for hair.</li>
    <li> Must be said that it does the job, however as overpriced as it is I am not going to continue using it. I got small sample size bottles on Amazon just to try it out to avoid the automatic renewal loop-hole that you fall into if you order it directly from the  WEN site.  It leaves the hair smooth but it gets greasy after less than 1 day. The price is way to high.   Not worth spending money on.</li>
    <li> I would like this product if it did not have such a &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; smell.  It works just as well as the other WEN products I have tried but won&#x27;t order it again because of the smell.</li>
    <li> I finally gave in and tried Wen out! I knew that it was a little spendy but everyone says it so worth and boy were they right! I bought this 6 oz. bottle just to try it out.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! I went onto QVC and bought 2 of the 32oz. bottles and threw out all of my shampoo conditioner and I will never go back to them again.  I have baby fine hair that is easily weighed down and usually gets oily by the end of the day and also have dry scalp issues.  This is so gentle and gives amazing body and I can&#x27;t believe how healthy my hair looked after one use! It did not weigh my hair down at all, like I though it would, and it smells divine! I have been using it daily now for about two months and my dry scalp is completely gone (major plus is that it doesn&#x27;t give me acne around the hair line like a lot of other conditioners did) and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as frequently, which I have to say I could never ever go a day with out washing my hair before because my hair would be oily by the end of the day.  This is a miracle product and I can&#x27;t believe that I waited so long to try it out.  EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with severe psoriasis on my scalp for years.  I have steriod medication that worked only as long as I was using it, then I became pregnant and had to stop.  It was horrible,on a recommendation from my sister decided to try WEN and it has changed my life.  I&#x27;m still a bit flakey here and there but its not painful or itchy at all!  It has literally kept me from ripping my hair out.  Along with my hair is now lovely and soft and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo 3 times.  My hair felt like there was a weird coating on it.  It became flat and greasy looking.  Not a good product for fine hair!</li>
    <li> It is a good product and i would use it all the time&lt;br /&gt;But 30 dollars for 6 oz. thats outragious</li>
    <li> Okay so I got this WEN cleaning conditioner to see how it would respond to my hair. I&#x27;ve seen the informercials and thought why not?&lt;br /&gt;I used as directed and then air dried my hair till it was 90% dry and then blow dried it.&lt;br /&gt;I saw no difference. My extensions however suffered. The ends became dry and sticky as if I applied wax on it. I did not blow out the ends of my extensions at all. So overall, it&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I rather use Treseme moist conditioner instead and get better results.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting it to be. Not like the infomercial. It may work better for a different hair type though. (I have natural light blonde, long, very thick and wavy hair).</li>
    <li> I have had course hair that is very dry for years. Ever since my hair started to grey it has been like bristles on a brush. I have tried every conditioner known to man including leave in, hot oil treatments etc etc. I just bought this and wasn&#x27;t expecting anything big, especially after the first use. What a pleasant surprise after just one use my hair is soft, shiny and the dryness is gone. It also stopped the itch. This is truly a miraculous product. I have bought many thing from watching infomercials..juicer, rotisserie oven,sandwich toaster, you name it and I bought it. They were all crap. This is the first product that matches up with what the infomercial said. I have been using it now for about a month and my hair is like new again. It even appears that the new hair coming in is less grey and thicker. I recommend this to anyone. I am a guy in my late 40&#x27;s and don&#x27;t spend a lot of time grooming myself. This is really easy just rinse hair with water for 1 minute, apply as directed and rinse.  This is easy and any guy or gal with bad hair should give it a try.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the WEN line for my long, thick hair. I started using Wen a year ago because I hated the static in the winter. I got so much more with this product - my hair is shiny, healthy, soft, and NO STATIC!! Another thing I love is when I get out of the shower and comb my hair - NO SNARLS!!!! It&#x27;s so much easier to comb now after a shower and in general. I&#x27;ve tried the Sweet Almond Mint, Pomegranate, Fig, Cucumber Aloe, and Tea Tree. For my hair, the Tea Tree works the best.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well. This is the first time that I can believe an infomercial. I will definitely buy the product again.</li>
    <li> First of all:  I live Wen and will only use wen products.  I have never had a problem- until I opened this package up.  I ordered a small, 6 oz size because i normally use the sixthirteen and the pomegranate and i wanted to give the tea tree a try before ordering the larger size.  what i found when i opened up the box from amazon was this: The bottle had conditioner all over it on the outside and the pump had obviously been opened and the product had obviously been used already.  On top of that, it smelled rancid and looked diluted!  Wen products are only good for two years because of all the natural extracts that they contain.  This is obviously a very old bottle that had already been used.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not live up to expectations, Loreal total repair works just as good but at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try Wen hair products so when I read that the Tea Tree line helped with an itchy scalp I went for it. The first time I used it it felt really strange. The thick no lather conditioner formula has an odd feel to it and takes some getting used to but it works great. It rinses out thoroughly and leaves my hair squeaky clean, soft, it works really well on my itchy scalp (not dandruff, just itchy) and It has a cooling, tingly sensation. I can skip a shampoo and my hair is still clean and soft. The directions call for 20-30 pumps but 5 pumps filled my hand completely. I have very short hair and with a little experimentation I found that 4-5 pumps does the trick quite nicely. I do not use leave in conditioner so I left that step out but I do not need it because I get plenty of conditioning from the shampoo step. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product worked. I like it a lot and will buy it again. That said, there are a few drawbacks:  1) the information on the label is so tiny that even with my glasses on I could not read it. I had to look it up on the Internet.  2) after rinsing, the shower floor is slightly slippery.  3) Tea Tree has an unpleasant aroma, not so bad that I collapsed a lung, but kind of stinky. However, once my hair dried I didn&#x27;t  notice it anymore.  4) it&#x27;s expensive, especially if you need 20-30 pumps.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE all of the Wen products, however the Tea Tree is definitely not the best scent for me. It still works great and leaves my hair amazing though.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, since 2 years ago my curls are not the same, so I thought that by using this product I will had my curls back, well not really, I just like the movement of my hair  that&#x27;s all.... :(</li>
    <li> Love this product my hair has never felt so clean or soft</li>
    <li> The fear, with  a product like this, is that it may leave the hair greasy or oily, as it&#x27;s basically a cleaning &#x27;conditioner&#x27; with no surfactants in it. However, it does not leave the hair anything except soft and shiny, very nice result. Have been using it for two months now, and except fot he cost, I find it to be a very good product. Just don&#x27;t buy it from the home site of the creator, or you will find yourself automatically enrolled in a &#x27;club&#x27; which will send you products monthly unless you go through the cumbersome process of un-enrolling.</li>
    <li> I like the concept, and it makes my hair feel soft while it is wet, but that is the end of anything good I can say about the product.  Wen is advertised to be less damaging and more conditioning to damaged hair.  It is neither.  The product dried out my hair more than the shampoos I used before, and stripped out any oils in the hair completely.  It contains some kind of wax, because it coated both my hair and my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair, and have never had difficulty with fading.  Wen stripped all the color out of my hair on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wen is EXTREMELY expensive.  Unless you just love throwing your money away for a product that does not deliver on any of its promises, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> The product is great for managing my dry, curly hair but it is hard to get past it&#x27;s unique smell.</li>
    <li> It is okay product..... Costly....and can&#x27;t be used as the only alternative to wash your hair as it builds up and will need clarifying shampoo to remove the build up!&lt;br /&gt;I used it 3 times and it was just okay I exactly used it the way they have told!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy  it again.... I will stick to my fairy tales rosemary shampoo which is natural/ organic and works great and is much lighter on my pocket.</li>
    <li> Wen cleansing coniditioner is the best product i have used for cleansing my hair.  This is great to tame thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love Wen.  It helped me get my hair back to my natural texture.  I don&#x27;t use any other shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> Live the cream.  Had to get used to using it since I never used wen before. Vi would buy again. Always watching Amazon for specials on wen</li>
    <li> Awesome- cleans beautifully, not oily or heavy, rinses clean and styles great. Initially, even though it styled great, i was leery about build up. After washing my hair about 7 times, it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any harmful residue. I have long naturally curly hair which i often blow out and flat iron. I was able to blow out my hair and don&#x27;t always need to flat iron it with this. I just ordered the fig cleanser too. So far, I am quite impressed. My clients that use Wen have noticeable improvement in the hydration of their hair as well as improved color retention. Very Impressed to say the least.  UPDATE: Ordered and used the Fig- love it even more. May I make a suggestion to first time users? You may have years of build up on your hair. Before starting the Wen system, use a clarifying shampoo twice in the shower, and then use the Wen. I have been trolling around the web, reading reviews. It seems to me, many people start the new system w/o properly cleansing their hair first. If you have residue from cheaper products, like Pantene, on your hair, the waxy build up may not let the Wen through to do what it needs to. I clarify many of my clients before I even give them a haircut- I can feel the buildup. ...Just a thought. Happy Wenning!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty small bottle BUT I am happy I purchased this so I could try it out - now I will only buy this instead of regular shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s weird not getting a lather - but make sure you rub it in as if you were washing your hair with standard shampoo and rinse well.</li>
    <li> Shipped really quickly,&lt;br /&gt;package was excellent&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell omg so fresh and the tingle ..&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair just wake up. really.&lt;br /&gt;my hair has never felt softer,looked more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;even my husband is using it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you WEN !!!</li>
    <li> When I saw my friend&#x27;s Wen in her shower, I laughed. Cher endorsed Wen. SNL made fun of it. I need a hardcore shampoo to clean my scalp but an extreme conditioner to protect my bleached hair. I don&#x27;t need some thick mayo looking stuff to clean my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I tried this is because of tea tree oil- I love the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST thing about this conditioner is how your scalp tingles as you rub it all in. After rinsing and hopping out of the hot shower, my scalp and neck were still tingling and it felt sooo clean and nice. My hair lacks a good &#x27;bounce&#x27; if I don&#x27;t roller brush it while I blow dry. I don&#x27;t roller brush it often because it takes too long but with this Wen Tea Tree, my hair was bouncy and fresh all day. And my hair is oily and limp by 6pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t add it in as a &#x27;leave-in conditioner&#x27;. I just use a few sprays of It&#x27;s A Ten and a tiny bit of hair serum after I blow dry and before I straighten. Literally- it&#x27;s perfect. And this is coming from a oily-scalp chick who lives in Texas heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be scared to use this- my scalp felt more clean from this stuff than a shampoo ever did, yet, my hair was so soft and bouncy!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite product. I purchased the &amp;#34;Fig&amp;#34; by WEN and I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as I was with this product. My hair is natural now and this feels so good going through it. It keeps it moisturized for sure. A must buy in my opinion especially if your hair is natural and thick.</li>
    <li> I started using only Wen products at home about a year ago, and I am happy with them. I still have thin wispy hair, I don&#x27;t think anything is going to change that. But with Wen, my hair is shinier and looks healthier -- even when I have it colored or bleached. And it seems to stay nice and fresh looking longer between washes, too.</li>
    <li> i have to use it as a conditioner or it makes my hair oily but I love it my hair has never been more healthy</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  I enjoy the smell though and use it as a leave in conditioner sometimes.</li>
    <li> I love Wen products. I have relaxed hair and Wen works well for me. But Wen Tea Tree Cleanser is very drying. I probably would not purchase this flavor again. But I love cucumber aloe and fig.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product when coloring your hair, as it gets out the colorant without harming your color.  Leaves hair manageable. Only I need a larger bottle. I use as many products with Tea Tree in them as I am a diabetic. I have use this on my grandchildrens toy poodle.  It leaves her very soft.</li>
    <li> I bought WEN as a last resort. My hair looked fried, limp and my scalp was in awful condition. Now my hair looks fuller, feels softer and my scalp is in better shape. WEN is amazing. I&#x27;ll never go back to shampoo again.</li>
    <li> It was not as aromatic as the Sweet Almond and the results does not warrant the price. Does not out perform Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
    <li> This product is not what I had expected. It left my hair oily, scalp itchy and got worse as the day progressed. I have thick curly hair, the perfect profile for this product and I will never use or buy it again. I should have done my research and read reviews before I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> I have not been kind to my hair over the last few years and combine that with medication that made it fall out and break, and I was desperate. I went back and forth with which scent and variety to get. I decided on Tea Tree. I had previously tried the Loreal one and hated it. It made my hair so slimy. I have very thick, medium length, bleached, and damaged hair that I straighten with my blow dryer and occaional flat iron. It started breaking off and leaving me with short pieces.  I typically wash my hair every 3 days if I can get away with it. Sometimes a 4th in a bun. So, this product worked just fine for that. I saw another review where she recommended a cider vinegar rinse first to clarify. I did that. The combo of the vinegar and tea tree was pretty gross, but I was thankful that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with other reviews, I can recommend that you take your time. And RINSE!!! I always give it a cold water shock at the end.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is true tea tree, so it is strong. But it fades.&lt;br /&gt;It did give my hair a lot of body, which I dont really care for since my hair is super thick, but a swipe with the flat iron, and I was good to go. I cant wait to try the fig next.  I bought the pomegranate for my daughter who has thin, highlighted spiral curls. And it works great for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont forget to have a wide toothed comb in the shower with you. I also didnt use the 20 pumps recommended. Just seemed like too much</li>
    <li> I bought the Tea Tree.  I have terrible dandruff and my scalp gets so dry ,  it hurts.  After using the Tea Tree  my scalp is healthy. No more&lt;br /&gt;dandruff or dry scalp. I told my niece about it and now she is going to use the Tea Tree also. I love this product and I tell everyone about it.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use any other product to clean my hair .</li>
    <li> 2 weeks ago I bought the 16 oz. tea tree Wen cleansing conditioner. I ordered 1 bottle, was sent 3 packages. one I sent back unopened, one I opened and there were 2 bottles, I returned it. the one I kept was ok but fake. if Wen products are real they will have the word Wen embossed on the bottom of the bottle. I am working on getting a refund as they did refund the others I sent back. tried one more time and ordered 1 16 oz. bottle of the spring gardenia tea tree product. on the bottom is Wen embossed, can&#x27;t wait to try it. no invoice arrived in package, that&#x27;s somewhat scary.</li>
    <li> I have always kept my hair really short as it is thin, dull, and frizzy.  I finally decided that maybe if I used a better &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;, my hair might actually look better/feel better.  Only used this for 3 days before I noticed a significant change in my hair, and now that I have been using it for 3 weeks, people have actually commented on how much better my hair looks!  It has body and looks thicker in general, and the best part is that it seems to help my nails grow as well-added bonus!  So hopefully, with my new cleansing conditioner I can let my hair grow out for a change!  Thanks Wen!  Can&#x27;t brag about you enough!</li>
    <li> This product creates not only healthy hair, but works very well for the scalp.  The Tea Tree ingredient feels invigorating, especially when you leave it on for five minutes for additional conditioning.  My very curly, unruly hair responded and looked better than usual.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice since the product is both cleaning and conditioning, so only one step.</li>
    <li> Infomercials scare me, cause most are crap. However, I have gotten a few \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; things that have been wonderful. This would be 1 of them.&lt;br /&gt;I first got the whole thing. But my hair is short, so I&#x27;m not quite finished with the other stuff it comes with. So I got the conditioner by itself.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try the tea tree oil one just to see how that one is. Also, tea tree oil smells and I wanted to see if it stuck as bad.&lt;br /&gt;It still does but not as bad. My hair is weird and loves tea tree. It grows and looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;With Wen, it does what it says. My hair is thin, damaged, brittle, frizzy, you name it. I kind of reminds you of that blonde on the infomercial. After I washed it the first time I was in love.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing!! I would recommend trying it out from amazon first, only because there are some people that don&#x27;t like it and on the Wen site, it&#x27;s autoship and that&#x27;s a pain to stop.&lt;br /&gt;So it maybe a little more on here, but if you don&#x27;t like it, then you don&#x27;t have the frustration of calling customer service and answering all kinds of questions. IDK what product it is, but I hate dealing with customer service.&lt;br /&gt;But definitely buy this. You will love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ruined me from ever using regular shampoo and conditioners. LOL</li>
    <li> I use wen products to help keep my waves under control.</li>
    <li> It is a great hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product is quite expensive for what it delivers. The ads would suggest it is a miracle product, which, of course, it is not. Using as many pumps as it suggests would use this bottle up in about two shampoos, so again, not very cost effective. Hair and scalp do feel nice, and it is a good product, but would never spring for the large bottle.</li>
    <li> My only disappointment was that it didn&#x27;t take care of my dandruff as I&#x27;d hoped. I had to still use my special shampoo seperate for that which dries out my hair. But other than that I believe it is a great product. It left my hair clean but light and not weighed down with product. Hair looked and felt soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Use only wen products in my hair. No chemicals and makes your hair better over time. I use this formula and others.</li>
    <li> My friend is blind and does not have good luck with ordering for herself from Amazon, so I will make purchases for her...have them shipped straight to her and she reimburses me.  It&#x27;s worked well so far and she likes the WEN, but the Tea Tree scent is a bit too much for her.  Since she told me that I have sent her the remaining half bottle of my original WEN purchase (the Sweet Almond Mint beginner kit) and she likes that one better....so it has worked out.</li>
    <li> Still turned my hair yellow. Love the way my scalp feels but yellow hair doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Good smell to conditioner. Leaves hair soft and easy to comb ethnic hair.Just ordered the larger size, a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair gets very oily if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday, so I was skeptical of a cleansing conditioner. It does clean my hair nicely on the first wash, but I can&#x27;t use it two days in a row. If I do my roots look oily and my hair is weighed down. It is nice to use this a couple times a week though. In the winter it did help my hair to be less static-y.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s making my hair fall out. I switched to another shampoo and not near the same strands in the drain as when I use Wen.</li>
</ol>
