      <li>Smells pretty good though.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for the beach look</li>
      <li>Gives body to fine hair and makes it more manageable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very rooty and organic smelling which can be good if you&#x27;re into that.</li>
      <li>It is most effective with hand styling (versus heat and tools) and dries to a much softer finish than any hair spray I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I have tried almost every texture/beachy/wave products out there ranging in price from $4-$30 and this one is hands down the best.</li>
      <li>and I have fine but lots of hair,</li>
      <li>, it creates light wispy waves and gives my hair kinda the Nicole Ritchie hair feel.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy Bamboo shampoo, so I decided to try this product to hold my hair without adding weight or stiffness.  </li>
      <li>I have to use this product because it is sulfa free</li>
      <li>and when I take my hair down in the morning I have the most beautiful beach waves.</li>
      <li>No waves at all no matter how much I try to style it !!!</li>
      <li>I should add that my hair is super fine</li>
      <li>People with fine hair may not find it as useful.</li>
      <li>The smell is the only good thing about it.</li>
      <li>Really sprays on nice and hair holds really well.</li>
      <li>This spray smells great and gave my naturally wavy hair soft body.</li>
      <li>I was really worried that it looked frizzy and greasy in some areas, but after brushing and re scrunching my dried hair I was thrilled as my hair smoothed out into gorgeous voluminous  beach waves.</li>
      <li>great for preventing frizz and taming down curly unruly hair.  </li>
      <li>Ordered a full size bottle right away.</li>
      <li>My hair is a bit fine, so when it grows to any length, it doesn&#x27;t hold shape very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to keep my products more natural for my hair</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Makes me feel fresh like a beach.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this mist and it does wonders to perk up my long, fine, stringy hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, limp hair and this product gives me more fullness than any product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Amazing even on dry hair</li>
      <li>Works pretty well</li>
      <li>The first time I did this</li>
      <li>I love the non greasy spray that adds tons of volume to next day hair or after the gym hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Previously, I used Fekkai Marine Hair Beach Waves, which I really loved, but I had trouble finding it</li>
      <li>It gives you nice loose waves or curls, depending on how much you twist each area with your fingers.</li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s still very damp, I spray the top and underside of my hair, probably about 8-10 sprays total.</li>
      <li>If you want texture, soft but full, this is the product for you.</li>
      <li>This product smells great and gives just enough hold without weighing hair down.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly, and most of the time, I use hot rollers and/or a flat iron to style it.  </li>
      <li>Their salt spray [...] has coconut oil in it too so its very moisturizing rather than drying out the hair.</li>
      <li>When I do wear it curly, this product really works.  </li>
      <li>My hair is really straight as a pin.  </li>
      <li>This is a gentle hair spray for creating a tousled, wavy , piece-y , semi-curly look.</li>
      <li>i have dryish hair and found it very drying...</li>
      <li>It just really works.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it with a hair dryer because I really try not to use heat on my hair.</li>
      <li>I was slightly disappointed after reading so many great reviews, I was eager to try it.</li>
      <li>A little is a lot of this product, so just give hair a light, even, all over dusting and it will be more than enough.</li>
      <li>Some days I get pretty soft ringlets,</li>
      <li>I love Alterna products in general, so checked out this spray when looking to replace the Salt Spray I&#x27;ve been using that makes my hair sticky and dry.</li>
      <li>I noticed that my hair gets a better outcome from this product if it is almost dried.</li>
      <li>After a few spritzes of this, I get much more &#x27;tousle&#x27; in the ends.</li>
      <li>can give it a touch of crunch every once and again, but not usually.</li>
      <li>Gives it nice big waves and hides imperfections from &amp;#34;bed&amp;#34; hair if I want to wear my hair down the next day without having to completely re-style!</li>
      <li>and also if you don&#x27;t have time to fully dry your hair, you can add this, and it will add a little wave, and let your hair dry naturally, and look very cute, and I do that very often!</li>
      <li>I bought this because I was looking for a natural product to give me beachy waves.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. I have to use this product because it is sulfa free and it was the only product that worked well on my hair, this product helps to hold my curly hairstyles all day long.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and wavy/frizzy hair. I was hoping to be able to use this product as a way to get out of blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair every time I wash it. Unfortunately when I used it that way it did nothing but leave my hair every bit as frizzy/horrible as it would have been without any product whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars because I have found that if I use it AFTER blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair (like on the 2d day after washing especially) it will give me a sort of acceptable wavy look. It&#x27;s not really frizzy anyway, provided I also use my Frizz-Ease hair serum and gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, meh. But I warn that it could be that my hair is just so awful that no product will be able to tame it properly.</li>
    <li> Spray this on after shampooing your hair and let it dry naturally.  Gives body to fine hair and makes it more manageable.  Does not weigh down your hair and adds shine.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but it does leave my hair a little crunchy. I prefer sea salt spray. This works well enough that I&#x27;ll use it up, but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing even on dry hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK. Didn&#x27;t work as I expected it would. Not a great hold.</li>
    <li> I love Alterna products in general, so checked out this spray when looking to replace the Salt Spray I&#x27;ve been using that makes my hair sticky and dry. This spray smells great and gave my naturally wavy hair soft body. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is really good for nice beach waves or that tousled look. It is not as drying as most sea sprays are. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> You easly can get the same result without this spray...</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this mist and it does wonders to perk up my long, fine, stringy hair.  The only downside for me is that it does dry my hair out, so I only use it occasionally.</li>
    <li> Perfect no fuss do. I have bayalaged hair(colored) my hair is to the middle of my back and I have fine but lots of hair, some wavy when wet. I love blowing out my hair but hate the time it takes, especially here on East Coast when humidity hits. This is great, here is my preferred style process:&lt;br /&gt; I towel dry thoroughly, then spray on hair starting at roots and spray to ends, I scrunch my hair repeatedly as it air dries, then when dried completely I use my soft cushioned paddle brush and brush out. The first time I did this I was really worried that it looked frizzy and greasy in some areas, but after brushing and re scrunching my dried hair I was thrilled as my hair smoothed out into gorgeous voluminous  beach waves. For 2nd day hair I lightly mist this onto my dry hair in the morning, then scrunch and let dry, to enhance my waves I may touch up areas with a curling iron but that&#x27;s it! Non greasy, gives me pretty loose wave, shine and volume without using heat. This will be my summer daily style, and the added bonus of saving my hair from thermal damage.</li>
    <li> I love using this when I either don&#x27;t have time to dry my hair or just want to be lazy and not dry it! Ha! It really gives your hair a natural wave without weighing it down. My only complaint would be that I had to use a lot to get the waves I wanted. This could be because I have long hair, though. Also, it didn&#x27;t help with friz...if anything I think my hair may have been frizzier with this product. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, but it was kinda frizzy.</li>
    <li> I liked how it textured my hair but it did dry out my hair a bit which is why I stopped using it. I liked it but not liked it enough to keep using it on my dry and color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my curly hair.  This product is not sticky or greasy, yet helps you give your hair that styled and finished look.  Smells great, and works great.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but worth it.  Versatile.....if you&#x27;re looking for that sleek backed look or soft waves.  A little is a lot of this product, so just give hair a light, even, all over dusting and it will be more than enough.</li>
    <li> Eh not so sure about this one</li>
    <li> Finally!  Something that actually works. I have tried lots of products on my curls and nothing comes close to this one.  My curls are gorgeous!  The turn out soft and touchable, not hard or crunchy feeling like some products i have used in the past. It&#x27;s a little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a natural product to give me beachy waves. I&#x27;m trying to keep my products more natural for my hair and I searched for a long time before I decided on a product. I&#x27;ve only used this a few times and each time it turned out well. I haven&#x27;t used it with a hair dryer because I really try not to use heat on my hair. So, I can&#x27;t tell you how well it works with a hair dryer. I just used it on damp hair, twisted certain areas and let it air dry. It gives you nice loose waves or curls, depending on how much you twist each area with your fingers. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try. The only thing I didn&#x27;t realize was how small the bottle would be. That&#x27;s my fault though. I should have read the description. The price is a bit high for the little bottle, but it definitely works.</li>
    <li> It works ok. I hAve to use a lot to get desired results. Smells pretty good though. Probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> i have dryish hair and found it very drying... maybe perfect for those with oily hair though. Contains alcohol in ingredients list.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair so dry. The waves dont hold. I have generally frizzy, dry , non-colored hair but this particularly makes my hair very dry.</li>
    <li> Ever since Redken Spray Starch went away, I was looking for a product which would help help my curls during the final blow drying and this did it.  I love it</li>
    <li> This is a gentle hair spray for creating a tousled, wavy , piece-y , semi-curly look. You can also use it to restyle curls/waves that have gone astray. It is most effective with hand styling (versus heat and tools) and dries to a much softer finish than any hair spray I have ever tried. My hair is thick and wavy with lots of body and this works for me. People with fine hair may not find it as useful.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I can style my hair, spray this on my hair and off I go. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, but gives it a very natural look. It has a very light scent which is a plus in my book. I don&#x27;t want to smell like a flower shop  walking outside or at work. I have bought it a few times, and I still would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works ok but thought would hold better</li>
    <li> This product did not work well with my hair. I found it very drying, and although I had high hopes based on the great reviews I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> great for preventing frizz and taming down curly unruly hair.  can give it a touch of crunch every once and again, but not usually.</li>
    <li> Stinks...doesn&#x27;t work that well and like I said, stinks. Like literally. I can&#x27;t explain the smell...just like old mothballs or something? I don&#x27;t know...reminded me of my great-grandma which is why I&#x27;m referencing that.</li>
    <li> I use this product in combination with a curling cream to help give that beachy wave to my hair. This product smells great and gives just enough hold without weighing hair down. I use this on dry hair and scrunch to give that tousled look.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for my straight thick hair. :-(</li>
    <li> Great texture and a great scent. Makes me feel fresh like a beach.</li>
    <li> This is the stickiest spray I have ever used. I would go with a Davines or one from a company called La Tierra Sagrada. Their salt spray [...] has coconut oil in it too so its very moisturizing rather than drying out the hair. The 2 I mentioned in this review aren&#x27;t sticky AT ALL and have a natural feel once they dry. This one is terrible and even hard to wash out. The smell is the only good thing about it.</li>
    <li> Great product that helps my hair curl but doesn&#x27;t add weight.</li>
    <li> Works great when paired with the cream. I brought the duo with me when I went on a cruise and it got the job done</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells, I love the way it feels!  Great Product.  When you need that \\&quot;touch up\\&quot;, this product works. (wife speaking!)</li>
    <li> I was slightly disappointed after reading so many great reviews, I was eager to try it. However, the smell is truly a little bit weird and not very fresh. It&#x27;s very rooty and organic smelling which can be good if you&#x27;re into that. It&#x27;s not terrible and you can get used to it though. I noticed that my hair gets a better outcome from this product if it is almost dried. When you put it on soaking wet hair it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
    <li> Great for refreshing curls and waves to hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my hair. Helps keep my hair from frizzing and my wavy-curly hair mostly manageable. And keeps a tousled light-damp look to it.&lt;br /&gt;Here in Florida where the humidity&#x27;s high most of the time this is great for me. Where hairspray just doesn&#x27;t work. In a dry zone like Dallas Tx, you can also keep frizz down with this and not have to deal with a lot of fly-away hair when the winds blow</li>
    <li> So disappointed.  This did not do at all what it said.  It made my hair look dull and my scalp itch.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  I use it every time I wash my hair.  If you want texture, soft but full, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of using salt spray/texture spray during high humidity to help my hair achieve its potential in waviness. I have a thick head of long, fine hair, and it has natural wave when the weather is humid, though it definitely needs help to achieve it. This works pretty well when layered on mostly dry hair that has already been prepped with wave-creating products (I like a mixture of Bumble&#x27;s Texture and Grooming cremes on damp hair, then blow dry to 90% dry). After a few spritzes of this, I get much more &#x27;tousle&#x27; in the ends. However, it is finicky - sometimes it&#x27;s not terribly effective on second day hair, making it go flat instead of re-waved. However, unlike most tousle spray, it does NOT make my hair dry or dull, so I consider it a keeper, all things considered.</li>
    <li> My long hair is wavy to curly and so far I really like this product after using it for a few weeks. It&#x27;s a lightweight formula that isn&#x27;t sticky and has a pleasant but not overwhelming scent; it&#x27;s also free of a lot of synthetic crap that doesn&#x27;t need to be on our bodies. The spray mechanism is also really nice and disperses the product evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning my hair, I wrap it in a towel for a while to soak up some water. When it&#x27;s still very damp, I spray the top and underside of my hair, probably about 8-10 sprays total. I gently scrunch my hair and lift up at the roots so that it&#x27;s not all flat (I&#x27;ve heard that overworking curly hair when wet is what makes it frizzy). Then I just let it air dry. I never use my diffuser so I don&#x27;t know how it works with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I used Fekkai Marine Hair Beach Waves, which I really loved, but I had trouble finding it so I switched products. I would recommend this for people who already have curly hair and want to give some definition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many, many waving beach potions over the years. This has few ingredients and really springs lifeless hair back to a bouncy wave. It will leave hair crunchy so you have to figure out the best amount to use for the look you are going for and whether to separate the crunch with your fingers or a pick. My hair is dry so I use a leave in spray conditioner and air dry a bit, then rub a little glossing cream onto dry ends. I arrange with a pic,&lt;br /&gt;then spray this on, scrunch a bit and it springs uniformly into beach waves! It also works great on bed head,. Just spritz on dry hair and arrange with fingers separating to avoid any crunchiness. I have told everyone how great this product is!</li>
    <li> My hair is really straight as a pin.  I spray the Alterna Bamboo into my hair and scrunch it and let it go and I get really nice waves.  Sometimes I use a diffuser to dry to get a little more volume.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Wish this was a magical wave producing product, but it isn&#x27;t, at least not for me.  Some days I get pretty soft ringlets, some days I don&#x27;t... about the same as any other product I use on my natural curl.</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; hair product. I use it as a finisher after I&#x27;ve used mousse and blown dry my wavy hair.</li>
    <li> It just really works.  I have very fine, limp hair and this product gives me more fullness than any product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It gives me curly waves.  All I do is spray and scrunch.</li>
    <li> The smell is okay but nothing great. The mist does not do what it is supposed to at all. It just makes my hair greasy and weights it down to the point I look as if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in days. No waves at all no matter how much I try to style it !!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Really sprays on nice and hair holds really well. Not sticky and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the beach look</li>
    <li> Tried this product as a sample fell in love with it. Ordered a full size bottle right away. I love the non greasy spray that adds tons of volume to next day hair or after the gym hair. Leaves hair feeling clean and smelling great.</li>
    <li> Not pleased....  no boho waves for me. I tried Alterna Bamboo Style Boho Waves a couple of times just to make sure, but both times it left my hair messy &amp; unattractive. Returning.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Super lightweight, doesn&#x27;t bog my hair down.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, it creates light wispy waves and gives my hair kinda the Nicole Ritchie hair feel.  I should add that my hair is super fine yet I have a LOT of hair and it DOES NOT HOLD curl...so I was worried that this stuff wouldn&#x27;t work either.  But it did and it looked amazing.  I would totally recommend it to everyone I know what to achieve a textured/separated look.  Oh, and my hair is layered so that probably makes a difference as well.</li>
    <li> My hair is a bit fine, so when it grows to any length, it doesn&#x27;t hold shape very well.  I enjoy Bamboo shampoo, so I decided to try this product to hold my hair without adding weight or stiffness.  It gives my hair just enough texture.</li>
    <li> Awesome texture spray! However, a little goes a long way. Would only recommend for curly/curled hair, not so much for stick-straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every texture/beachy/wave products out there ranging in price from $4-$30 and this one is hands down the best. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down. Gives it nice big waves and hides imperfections from &amp;#34;bed&amp;#34; hair if I want to wear my hair down the next day without having to completely re-style!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly, and most of the time, I use hot rollers and/or a flat iron to style it.  When I do wear it curly, this product really works.  When my hair is dry, the curls are rather tight and my hair is frizzy.  This product defines the curls and stretches them out to look longer and more wavy and tousled, just as the product is named.  It also adds shine and tames the frizziness.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, which I am a big fan of alterna products, however I do use this quite often, exspecially when I just want a few small waves in my stick straight hair, it does add some waves, and it is also easy to use when in a hurry, and to make a messy look, which is really in style right now, this does the trick for the messy look sooo well! and also if you don&#x27;t have time to fully dry your hair, you can add this, and it will add a little wave, and let your hair dry naturally, and look very cute, and I do that very often! I would recommend this to anybody, it is a must have for me, and I will (hopefully) never be without it!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff. I spray it on damp hair at night before I put my hair up in a bun and when I take my hair down in the morning I have the most beautiful beach waves. They last all day long.</li>
