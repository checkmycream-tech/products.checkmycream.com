<li> is the brush is alittle too wide.</li>
<li> The picture does not accurately reflect this... will upload a photo shortly.</li>
<li> Not a large amount, but there is some in it.</li>
<li> so it turned out to be POLLY POCKET PINK!</li>
<li> Only complaint</li>
<li> I also use  Essie cuticle oil, base coat and top coat.</li>
<li> It has a slight silver sparkle to it that is hard to see online.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s a small one-</li>
<li> Received a few compliments on it already!</li>
<li> It was also extremely thick.</li>
<li> Overall, you cant go wrong with Essie!</li>
<li> Seriously this color is a must for spring and summer.</li>
<li> It was just bad.</li>

    <li> this product is really great. i love essie nail polish it is one of my favorites. received the item in great time</li>
    <li> Essie is always spot on with their colors. No matter the shade you can find every color with this brand. I originally tried this color at the nail shop and I haven&#x27;t changed brands since. Excellent color, durability, and brand!</li>
    <li> So cute.....added a little glitter over top......Only one coat need for full coverage.  The price was really awesome too!! Perfect for a little girl first nail polish</li>
    <li> The color is deceiving... it was a bit darker than the picture so it turned out to be POLLY POCKET PINK! I gave it to my 5 year old niece so that I wouldn&#x27;t feel like a child wearing it. It was also extremely thick. It didn&#x27;t spread well, and it dried to fast so that my fingers looked goopy. It was just bad.</li>
    <li> This is a great spring color. I love Essie polishes especially when you can get it at a great price!</li>
    <li> Beautiful pink color with shimmer, Great girly color. Opaque, only 2 coats needed to achieve bottle color. All season color.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color that is just the right mix of pink and purple! Will be my go to for spring and summer!</li>

    <li> Seriously this color is a must for spring and summer. The color has some shimmer to it but its nothing to explosive if you aren&#x27;t into glitter polishes. Very nice durability on my nails and the color pay off is great. One coat did the trick with this color so definitely a good polish.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a flat gloss and not one with a glittery finish.  would prefer it not have the frost effect.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I were surprised that this item has glitter in it. Not a large amount, but there is some in it. The picture does not accurately reflect this... will upload a photo shortly. The colour is nice though, and it&#x27;s a nice pink. Haven&#x27;t used it quite yet.</li>
    <li> I have several Essie polishes and love them all.They dry super fast.Only complaint and it&#x27;s a small one-is the brush is alittle too wide.Otherwise the polishes are wonderful The color is pretty and gets me compliments.</li>
    <li> I love this color.  Two coats is perfect for full coverage color.  Perfect spring/summer pink!!  Highly recommended.  I love the little gold flecks in this polish.....had a manicure in this color and had to add it to my collection.</li>
    <li> This polish is great.  It goes on nice and smooth. I also use  Essie cuticle oil, base coat and top coat. The polish lasts over a week and that is with cleaning and gardening.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this color from Walgreens for $8. If I would have none it would have been cheaper on Amazon, I would have totally purchased it on here. Anywho, great color. Its actually more \\&quot;pink\\&quot; than I expected it to be because it actually looks more purple in the store. Either way, I am impressed by how great and easy it applies. I needed only two coats and it came out great. It has a little shimmer to it as well, which I what I liked about it. Overall, you cant go wrong with Essie!</li>
