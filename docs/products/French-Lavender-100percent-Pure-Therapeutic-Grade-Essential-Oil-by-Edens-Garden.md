      <li>Like many product reviews these days - I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT in exchange for my biased review ;-) .  </li>
      <li>Like many product reviews these days - I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT in exchange for my biased review ;-) .  </li>
      <li>They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
      <li>My oils arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
      <li>I bought this scent for the first time and IT WORKS!  </li>
      <li>When I first bought this oil,I could not wait to get it!  </li>
      <li>For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
      <li>I make my own laundry detergent and used this lavender oil in my final product!</li>
      <li>This French Lavender is really nice.</li>
      <li>My favorite one is adding a drop of this oil to a full, brand new, clear tube of mascara.</li>
      <li>Again, just one drop for the whole tube!</li>
      <li>, this was my first purchase from this company, and I WILL be purchasing from them again.</li>
      <li>I love this essential oil!</li>
      <li>and/or rest peacefully.  </li>
      <li>I love Lavender oil and use it for several reasons.....to help sleep at night</li>
      <li>I have bought many of Edens garden essential oils.</li>
      <li>The funny thing is, is that most of these oils are purchased from the same sources and repackaged.</li>
      <li>The French lavender smells so lovely.</li>
      <li>I use it for cuts, it works better than any commercial product.....</li>
      <li>Also, Eden&#x27;s garden has some great deals on their website, not to mention that any order over $50 receives free shipping (sorry Amazon).</li>
      <li>I order as much of my essential oils from Eden &#x27;s Garden as possible , as I have found them to be a good quality , yet affordable .</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s strong but no strange after smell.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so pure</li>
      <li>And it is a oil that I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I hope you like it as much as I do.  </li>
      <li>I really like Eden Gardens</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>So many other companies are trying monopolize the market by saying that any EO that is affordable is not the real deal.</li>
      <li>Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  </li>
      <li>( I can see and feel the difference from other products that I&#x27;ve tried) top notch in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I purchased this lavender and many other oils.  </li>
      <li>I am not a big fan of Lavender but the French Lavender I really enjoy.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to order more and hope they are around for a long long time.  </li>
      <li>I prefer to use my clear lavender mascara before bed.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have to be clear, it could be whatever color you want.</li>
      <li>My picky 17 year old daughter has already confiscated my diffuser.</li>
      <li>I never knew so much about how you can use essential oils</li>
      <li>and I was transported to a lush spa.  </li>
      <li>The key point here is ONE drop in a brand new unopened tube!</li>
      <li>Not even half as strong as Eden&#x27;s Gardens regular lavender, which apparently I prefer.</li>
      <li>(French Lavender 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil - 10 ml)</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really diffuse into the air or linger very long.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s nice... only a drop or toe is needed...it&#x27;s strong but no strange after smell.</li>
    <li> Well, this item looks or seems very good and natural but probably not so this is not 100% pure lavender , and it smells good but not that good .</li>
    <li> Love it! Quality is excellent. Fast shipping.</li>

    <li> I love Lavender oil and use it for several reasons.....to help sleep at night I place a drop on my eye pillow and place over eyes the smell is just enough to relax the body......I use it for cuts, it works better than any commercial product.....use it in a mix with vinegar as fabric softener.....I never knew so much about how you can use essential oils but now that I have discovered them I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I am so very pleased with Eden Gardens products. This French Lavender is really nice. IM so glad I tried it! I order as much of my essential oils from Eden &#x27;s Garden as possible , as I have found them to be a good quality , yet affordable . ( I can see and feel the difference from other products that I&#x27;ve tried) top notch in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Always in my cupboard. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smell is great when mixed with carrier oil.</li>
    <li> I have bought many of Edens garden essential oils. I love them and find them to be just as good as the high end brands. If you have any doubts, please go to there website and read what they have to say. So many other companies are trying monopolize the market by saying that any EO that is affordable is not the real deal. The funny thing is, is that most of these oils are purchased from the same sources and repackaged. Give this company a chance and if you are not happy, at least you didn&#x27;t lose a ton of money. Did I mention that Edens garden is a woman owned company? I just love that too (sorry guys). Anyway, back to the oils. A little goes a long long way. I have used my lavender many many times and it stills looks like I have a full bottle. My oils arrived quickly and well packaged. The French lavender smells so lovely. It goes with almost any EO recipe. It is so versatile, not to mention the healing properties it has. My picky 17 year old daughter has already confiscated my diffuser. I added a few drops each of lavender, lemongrass, neroli and Rosemary and she was hooked! I got many amazing recipes and ideas from Pinterest. My favorite one is adding a drop of this oil to a full, brand new, clear tube of mascara. The key point here is ONE drop in a brand new unopened tube! It doesn&#x27;t have to be clear, it could be whatever color you want. I prefer to use my clear lavender mascara before bed. They say that adding this to your mascara will help your lashes grow longer and fuller! I have only been doing this for a few days, so I will update this to let you know how it went. Again, just one drop for the whole tube! Adding any more than one drop could irritate your eyes and you don&#x27;t want to get any EO in your eyes! So, if you have any doubts please check out there website! Also, Eden&#x27;s garden has some great deals on their website, not to mention that any order over $50 receives free shipping (sorry Amazon).

    <li> I needed a calming scent to help me sleep.  I bought this scent for the first time and IT WORKS!  It has a light fragrance, not overpowering which allows me to sleep and/or rest peacefully.  If you have trouble sleeping and/or need to rest buy this item, I guarantee you will love it. Thank you.  (French Lavender 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil - 10 ml)</li>
    <li> You cannot always get French Lavender in Essential Oils.  I really enjoy it so much better.  I am not a big fan of Lavender but the French Lavender I really enjoy.  I hope you like it as much as I do.  I really like Eden Gardens, their brands are very good.</li>
    <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>

They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
    <li> this essential oil is absolutely delicious. It has a much different aroma than the standard lavender and I love the scent. I&#x27;m quite happy with this French Lavender! And it is a oil that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> wonderful even more than lavender alone. great for diffusing and a drop on my pillow helped with sleep as well.</li>
    <li> Not even half as strong as Eden&#x27;s Gardens regular lavender, which apparently I prefer. If you want a strong lavender smell I wouldn&#x27;t choose this one.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this oil,I could not wait to get it!  Not only did it come in a timely manner, but that night, I put it in my humidifier and I was transported to a lush spa.  The smell is ahhmazing, the quality is very, very good and I know my oils!  I can&#x27;t wait to order more and hope they are around for a long long time.  Just the simple act of adding it to a warmer or in your bath will make you feel like a million bucks!</li>
    <li> beautiful fragrance, works well in all of the products i make like body scrubs, lotions, salves and deodorants</li>
    <li> I love this essential oil! It smells amazing and it&#x27;s so pure, this was my first purchase from this company, and I WILL be purchasing from them again. They provide a fantastic product and plenty of information on their products!</li>
