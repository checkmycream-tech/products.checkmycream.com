      <li>Amazing I love them.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re beautiful, affordable and very durable.</li>
      <li>You can get many uses out of them.</li>
      <li>I love this lashes</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more &amp; telling my girlfriend about KoKo Lashes!😍</li>
      <li>They are beautiful, but they dont have a natural bend</li>
      <li>These spiky beauties really make your eyes pop, no other lashes will do for me.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the thicker band these lashes can be worn many times provided that you take care of them,  which make these lashes a great value!</li>
      <li>and I love them sooo much!  </li>
      <li>The band is extremely thick, otherwise a great lash</li>
      <li>I will most definitely be reordering soon.</li>
      <li>By da way I love it so much I bought total #10 boxes!</li>
      <li>Beautiful dramatic lashes.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend the koko goddess lashes and if your on the fence about these just buy them you will not regret it!</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>They are full and thick but also very light in weight</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these lashes, they are a little heavy if you are not used to wearing lashes other than that they are amazing!</li>
      <li>Definitely stocking up on the other styles once they become available!</li>
      <li>They are heavier because of the thick band and may take some getting use to for beginners or those that wear the invisible band type lashes, but so worth it!</li>
      <li>I love this koko goddess lashes it adds glam to your looks without looking to dramatic.</li>
      <li>The Goddess lashes are the same as House of Lashes Iconic lashes for less then half the price!</li>
