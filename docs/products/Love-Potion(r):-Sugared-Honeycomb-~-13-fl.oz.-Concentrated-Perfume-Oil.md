### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>People I just met were commenting on my wonderful, beautiful, amazing perfume!!  </li>
      <li>This is gorgeous!</li>
      <li>This is a great &#x27;go to&#x27; honey scent.</li>
      <li>Great longevity.  </li>
      <li>LOL - great group, completely safe!!  </li>
      <li>A very effective cover scent for phero blends.</li>
      <li>This is a great stand-alone perfume, but it&#x27;s also surprisingly handy!</li>
      <li>This is the most delicious honey fragrance known to man!  </li>
      <li>It is attractive but doesn&#x27;t smell brazen, just gorgeous.</li>
      <li>It is perfect alone, however, as others have said, this is an easily layerable fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful honey scent--full and rich.  </li>
      <li>I decided to give this product a try since it had so many great reviews.</li>
      <li>Sugared Honeycomb is a great layer able scent.</li>
      <li>Sugared Honeycomb is sexy!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing honey scent that must be tried to be believed.</li>
      <li>It is like some kind of ripe fruit except it is not fruit.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m actually kind of iffy about using it again.  </li>
      <li>This is the nice thing about the perfume oils from this company, there aren&#x27;t any fixatives in them.</li>
      <li>Which is why I can&#x27;t imagine this scent as &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;syrupy.&amp;#34; On me, Sugared Honeycomb wears very light, floral, &amp; powdery (in the good way that I love).</li>
      <li>They are finely crafted and like good wine, age and change magically.</li>
      <li>It smells like powder and honey, but it is so bright, fresh, and juicy!  </li>
      <li>I also love it with Sugared Hay, which adds a touch of earthiness.</li>
      <li>but I love it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Potion Magickal Perfumes are my favorite products out there on the market--with or without pheromones.  </li>
      <li>have received many compliments on this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely sexy.</li>
      <li>I also love this product with Sugared</li>
      <li>Has become a go to favorite.  </li>
      <li>It is such a wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>I love ALL things honey and Sugared Honeycomb</li>
      <li>Honey is thought by many to be one of the sexiest scents there is.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>It is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sexy, but not in a way that&#x27;s inappropriate for daytime.</li>
      <li>I particularly love layering the honey with Sugared Oranges, Apricots or Pears &amp;/or Sugared Velvet Vanilla.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>Layers wonderfully with other perfumes as well.  </li>
      <li>It covers them perfectly and also blends with every other scent that I wear.</li>
      <li>will not disappoint you if you love the sweet, sexy, sticky goodness of the precious golden treasures of the hive.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the kind of perfume i&#x27;m used to, but i just can&#x27;t stop sniffing my wrists whenever i apply it ;)</li>
      <li>Its sort of the \\&quot;lingerie\\&quot; of perfume -- goes under everything, or by itself is super sexy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a great scent to layer with other fragrances when you want to add a sensual, sexy spin.&lt;br /&gt;Sugared</li>
      <li>In addition to being lovely on its own, it&#x27;s lovely layered with other perfumes, and works well for softening sharper notes and preventing them from becoming too \\&quot;pointy\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Honeycomb is a great starter honey scent for those who are new to the whole idea of Honey perfume.</li>
      <li>This was one of the first perfumes I ever used from Love Potion, about 6 years ago.  </li>
      <li>It feels like a rich buckwheat honey, robust and bursting with flavour and sweetness.</li>
      <li>Every scent is going to smell unique anyone wearing it.</li>
      <li>This is so absurdly rich and indulgent.</li>
      <li>Mara Fox serves up a beautifully rendered version of it too, so that it comes off smelling natural, not plasticky as many commercial honey interpretations can.</li>
      <li>Honey is amazing on its own, OR you can use it to layer with other scents.</li>
      <li>It does have a sweet honey scent, when I can smell it.</li>
      <li>This is not at all sweet or cloying.</li>
      <li>Smells just likes dripping sweet, syrupy honey but settles into an almost floral skin scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of sweet scents, and this one is a big WIN!</li>
      <li>As far as I am concerned, everything goes better with honey.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I wonder if I could send this back, or trade it for something else.</li>
      <li>Sexy, not obviously perfumey, provocative and rich.</li>
      <li>It softens while on the skin, and envelops you in your own sweet little cloud.</li>
      <li>I have several of Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie&#x27;s Sugared Scents (which are designed to be layerable).</li>
      <li>It smells like real honeycomb dripping with real honey, not the cloyingly sweet stuff out of the bear shaped squeeze bottle.</li>
      <li>Seriously, it makes my mouth water, lol...</li>
      <li>I love the refined, delicate sexy feel I get when wearing this.</li>
      <li>On a positive note, adding sample perfumes really works.</li>
      <li>but it has a slightly more powdery quality than I had expected.</li>
      <li>It really melds with my skin chemistry really well.</li>
      <li>I wear this warm scent year &#x27;round.</li>
      <li>I was totally unprepared for the positive response I received!!  </li>
      <li>A very thick, very sweet honey fragrance with a fairly strong powder note.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet, yet there&#x27;s a little darkness around&lt;br /&gt;the edges, and that darkness gives it a real OOMPH!</li>
      <li>I went (with DH) to a party, and met a lot of new friends.  </li>
      <li>Super sweet, thick, chewy honey.</li>
      <li>I also layer it with other Love Potion perfumes anytime I want to add a honey note to what I&#x27;m wearing, and finally, I use this scent as the cover scent for unscented pheromone blends.</li>
      <li>Another plus is I love dealing with a small, artisinal business where things are crafted with attention and all of the TLC that  Mara puts into each and every aspect of her business.</li>
      <li>On my skin, I get pure honey with a hint of white or purple clover.</li>
      <li>Apply with a light hand - it is a downright DIRTY, SEXY honey scent...</li>
      <li>Granted, I don&#x27;t want to attract bees with it&#x27;s sweet smell, but I hoped it would be a little stronger.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, it&#x27;s quite strong.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend that anyone new to LOVE POTION add this to their first order, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
      <li>Took a while to get used to it, much stronger than the other &amp;#34;potions&amp;#34; I am acquantaided with...</li>
      <li>This is a lovely, thick honey that turns slightly powdery and lets a touch of floral perfume come through on dry-down.</li>

<li> green-</li>
<li> but the scent still seems shallow.</li>
<li> However, I was a little disappointed in the size of the bottle and the strength of the scent.</li>
<li> This stuff could be dangerous!!</li>

    <li> This is a lovely, thick honey that turns slightly powdery and lets a touch of floral perfume come through on dry-down. It is attractive but doesn&#x27;t smell brazen, just gorgeous. Oh, and if you think honey plus five sugars is enough to make your teeth fall out don&#x27;t worry! This is not at all sweet or cloying. It&#x27;s just exactly what you need to be the flower all the bees want to buzz round!</li>
    <li> This is a great &#x27;go to&#x27; honey scent. I love the refined, delicate sexy feel I get when wearing this. It&#x27;s also a great scent to layer with other fragrances when you want to add a sensual, sexy spin.&lt;br /&gt;Sugared Honeycomb is a great starter honey scent for those who are new to the whole idea of Honey perfume.</li>
    <li> This product is a daily scent for me.  I use it alone, or layered under different scents when I want a sweeter, sexier smell.  I like amber and resin scents but find they are very sharp for me so Sugared Honeycomb softens the smell.  I also love this product with Sugared Amber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Potion Magickal Perfumes are my favorite products out there on the market--with or without pheromones.  They are finely crafted and like good wine, age and change magically.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing honey scent that must be tried to be believed. It smells like real honeycomb dripping with real honey, not the cloyingly sweet stuff out of the bear shaped squeeze bottle. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Took a while to get used to it, much stronger than the other &amp;#34;potions&amp;#34; I am acquantaided with...but I love it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick with this one is a little goes a looooooong way. I don&#x27;t even roll it, I just dab dab my wrists, behind my hears, neck and any other places that comes in mind. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received many compliments on this.</li>
    <li> Sugared Honeycomb is a great layer able scent. It&#x27;s extremely sexy. Smells just likes dripping sweet, syrupy honey but settles into an almost floral skin scent. It&#x27;s a must have for your perfume collection.</li>
    <li> To begin.. summery sigh..This is gorgeous! On my skin, I get pure honey with a hint of white or purple clover. It is perfect alone, however, as others have said, this is an easily layerable fragrance. I have several of Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie&#x27;s Sugared Scents (which are designed to be layerable). I particularly love layering the honey with Sugared Oranges, Apricots or Pears &amp;/or Sugared Velvet Vanilla. I also love it with Sugared Hay, which adds a touch of earthiness. I wear this warm scent year &#x27;round. I hear Van Morrison singing &amp;#34;Tupelo Honey&amp;#34; every time I roll on this intoxicating scent.</li>
    <li> Two things I would like to add:  For one thing, I actually purchased this oil a year ago and it has LITERALLY turned green- So I&#x27;m actually kind of iffy about using it again.  And finally?  The fragrance seems to remind me of plastic, then it settles to an odd floral scent.  Honestly, I wonder if I could send this back, or trade it for something else.</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance but it has a slightly more powdery quality than I had expected. A little goes a long way, it&#x27;s quite strong. A very thick, very sweet honey fragrance with a fairly strong powder note. A very effective cover scent for phero blends.</li>
    <li> This is the most delicious honey fragrance known to man!  I love this.  It is my favorite.  Everytime I wear it I get compliments!  It really melds with my skin chemistry really well. It smells like powder and honey, but it is so bright, fresh, and juicy!  It is like some kind of ripe fruit except it is not fruit.  This is truly a mouth watering fragrance.  It will remind you of sex, but don&#x27;t be put off by it.  It is such a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this product a try since it had so many great reviews. However, I was a little disappointed in the size of the bottle and the strength of the scent. Granted, I don&#x27;t want to attract bees with it&#x27;s sweet smell, but I hoped it would be a little stronger. It does have a sweet honey scent, when I can smell it. I used the product as directed on the instructions (thank you for that!) but the scent still seems shallow. I will continue to use it as directed and see if anyone can pick up the smell. On a positive note, adding sample perfumes really works. I would like to try one of the perfumes with the pheromones. We shall see.</li>
    <li> Honey... I love ALL things honey and Sugared Honeycomb will not disappoint you if you love the sweet, sexy, sticky goodness of the precious golden treasures of the hive. Honey is thought by many to be one of the sexiest scents there is. I share that belief! This is so absurdly rich and indulgent. Honey is amazing on its own, OR you can use it to layer with other scents. As far as I am concerned, everything goes better with honey. Mara Fox serves up a beautifully rendered version of it too, so that it comes off smelling natural, not plasticky as many commercial honey interpretations can. Another plus is I love dealing with a small, artisinal business where things are crafted with attention and all of the TLC that  Mara puts into each and every aspect of her business. I can not praise the perfumes or the service enough.</li>
    <li> Not terribly sweet, this reminds me of the scent of burning beeswax candles. A little goes a very long way. It smells mysterious, somewhat gothic, and would be a terrific cold weather scent. Sexy, not obviously perfumey, provocative and rich.</li>
    <li> I wear this on days that I don&#x27;t feel like wearing perfume. It is my imagined \\&quot;skin scent\\&quot; perfume. I also layer it with other Love Potion perfumes anytime I want to add a honey note to what I&#x27;m wearing, and finally, I use this scent as the cover scent for unscented pheromone blends. It covers them perfectly and also blends with every other scent that I wear. Its sort of the \\&quot;lingerie\\&quot; of perfume -- goes under everything, or by itself is super sexy.</li>
    <li> This stuff could be dangerous!! Apply with a light hand - it is a downright DIRTY, SEXY honey scent... Super sweet, thick, chewy honey. Seriously, it makes my mouth water, lol... I can wear this alone, or with other scents to \\&quot;sex\\&quot; them up a bit. Love it!</li>
    <li> Sugared Honeycomb is sexy!  I&#x27;m a big fan of sweet scents, and this one is a big WIN! It&#x27;s sweet, yet there&#x27;s a little darkness around&lt;br /&gt;the edges, and that darkness gives it a real OOMPH!

    <li> This was one of the first perfumes I ever used from Love Potion, about 6 years ago.  I was totally unprepared for the positive response I received!!  I&#x27;ll never forget it!!  I went (with DH) to a party, and met a lot of new friends.  People I just met were commenting on my wonderful, beautiful, amazing perfume!!  One man sat so close to me and actually nuzzled my neck!!  LOL - great group, completely safe!!  Anyway, I have never forgotten that experience and I highly recommend that anyone new to LOVE POTION add this to their first order, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
    <li> This one definitely smells like sex on me! It&#x27;s not the kind of perfume i&#x27;m used to, but i just can&#x27;t stop sniffing my wrists whenever i apply it ;)</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful honey scent--full and rich.  Great longevity.  Layers wonderfully with other perfumes as well.  Has become a go to favorite.  Highly recommended.</li>
