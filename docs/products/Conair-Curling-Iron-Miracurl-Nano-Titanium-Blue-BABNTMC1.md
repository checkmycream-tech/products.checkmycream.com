      <li>Easy to use!</li>

      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>Love love love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Everything is OK in this purchase.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I made sure to detangle the hair &amp; comb every section before using this item.&lt;br /&gt;5).</li>
      <li>My hairstylist first introduced Miracurl to me, using it for my wedding, and I just had to have one of my own!</li>
      <li>so if she sent it to me to order I know she will love it.</li>
      <li>And its an excellent product because I don&#x27;t really know how to curl my hair and with this its super easy</li>
      <li>It was easy to use</li>
      <li>Strongly would recommended for people to purchase this machine.  </li>
      <li>This curler is really effective if you separate your hair and spray that portion FIRST, before putting it into the machine.</li>
      <li>With Miracurl it was still curled and beautiful 24 hours later--</li>
      <li>but I manage to do it just fine</li>
      <li>(Good for lazy women like myself!)It beeps to let u know curl is ready too, so all curls are perfectly even.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s important to save the manual</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>,I was so excited because it came way before the estimated date.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the original.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Curls are amazing and they look cute the following day as well.</li>
      <li>a quick 10 min process for her, 35-45 mins for me...</li>
      <li>Christmas request from daughter who is super picky about her hair</li>
      <li>It is so fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is indeed the original one, not fake.</li>
      <li>Though I was skeptical about the cost, I&#x27;m really pleased with how easy it is to use and how great &amp; long-lasting the curls are.</li>
      <li>but well worth the purchase and effort.</li>
      <li>For me, it was absolutely worth it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This arrived super fast!  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Just received mine and first impression was was pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its not as heavy as I thought, also a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;3).</li>
      <li>Great product, easy to use, but beware of fakes sold cheaper, the don&#x27;t work, burn your hair and overheat, and they&#x27;re almost impossible to spot until you&#x27;ve used them, the paint rubs off too, always ask the seller if this is a genuine product.</li>
      <li>I was worried about a slight change to the device from original model but was able to confirm with conair that the change was legitimate and that this seller is as well.</li>
      <li>I just make sure my hair is totally dry</li>
      <li>Your choose,that,s what I like so much &amp; with this</li>
      <li>It does get a little hot to the touch around the face area, just made sure not to come to close &amp; when I did, I didn&#x27;t get burnt</li>
      <li>I definitely get better &amp; longer-lasting results using the Miracurl than a regular curling</li>
      <li>first use, I got luxurious lose curly hair, it was easy to use, not too heavy at all.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
      <li>The one thing I DO NOT like, is the fact the the settings are not listed on the wand; meaning the temperature, timing &amp; curling direction settings are not indicated directly on the wand.  </li>
      <li>will last me two days (and that&#x27;s without using much product).</li>
      <li>Love this product, I have very thick, long, coarse, wavy hair.  </li>

<li> Love this product, I have very thick, long, coarse, wavy hair.  </li>
<li> I like loose spirals and generally find the curls</li>
<li> Men, buy this for your wife if she has long hair!</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m using small sections (no more than 1&amp;#34;).</li>
<li> I did feel the need to grasp it tightly which is not necessary, this is just getting used to</li>
<li> only gripe about this product is that due to the length of my hair ( small of my back just pass the bra strap)</li>
<li> It takes a couple tries to get the hang of it</li>
<li> When it did jam, which was three times, &amp; it got jammed because my sections of hair were a bit thicker.  </li>
<li> or it gets stuck and jammed..</li>
<li> Money well spent</li>
<li> My hair is long and thick with lots of layers, so would barely hold a curl with other appliances and products.</li>
<li> Oh &amp; doing the back of my head was very odd.  </li>
<li> It is performing just as expected!</li>
<li> Loose Curls,med or Tight.</li>
<li> Be careful not to put too much hair into the roller, it will get angry with you and tangle.</li>
<li> I have to use less than 1/2&amp;#34; of hair</li>
<li> have hard to curl long hair</li>
<li> Did my entire head of hair in less than 45 minutes, my hair is just below the shoulders, its thin &amp; wavy.&lt;br /&gt;4).</li>
<li> My hair is long, thick, and wavy and can be hard to manage, so I&#x27;m always looking for something that will be idiot-proof and save me time.</li>
<li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I did have one bad tangle (the machine shut itself off, and then it took me a couple of minutes to work the hair out)</li>
<li> Product that was delivered was fake in obviously opened then resealed packaging</li>
<li> For those who have a hard time curling hair</li>
<li> I can curl my hair in 25mins, I have thick hair</li>
<li> I´m not saying about this seller, but I bought it Mira Curl – Bayliss at amazon.com totally FAKE.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome and so easy to use...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have very thick, long, coarse, wavy hair.  Had doubts that it would keep the curl and make my&lt;br /&gt;hair look good but it did.  Strongly would recommended for people to purchase this machine.  It was easy to use and I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have to worry about burning my hands or hair.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It takes a couple tries to get the hang of it but well worth the purchase and effort. Curls are amazing and they look cute the following day as well. Be prepared for the Shirley Temple look...lol...I reccomend you practice before you actually need the curls...lol</li>
    <li> I love this. Great curls, hair looks amazing. Very easy to use. This is indeed the original one, not fake.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, thick, and wavy and can be hard to manage, so I&#x27;m always looking for something that will be idiot-proof and save me time.

For me, it was absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I did have one bad tangle (the machine shut itself off, and then it took me a couple of minutes to work the hair out) but since then, I&#x27;ve had no problems. I just make sure my hair is totally dry and I&#x27;m using small sections (no more than 1&amp;#34;). I like loose spirals and generally find the curls will last me two days (and that&#x27;s without using much product). I definitely get better &amp; longer-lasting results using the Miracurl than a regular curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: I purchased from an online beauty supply store because I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon at the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Make&#x27;s Beautiful spiral curls.You have the option of having them 3 ways you like.Loose Curls,med or Tight. Your choose,that,s what I like so much &amp; with this BabylissPRO your hair will hold the curl all day!! Also,when I ordered my, I received it in within 3 to 4 days.Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Received the item within 3 days! Curls come out PERFECTLY! Money well spent</li>
    <li> I give 5 star review amazing speed for delivery, and looks nice</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the original.</li>
    <li> This was a counterfeit product.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and the hair is beautiful</li>
    <li> loved it! perfect curls!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have hard to curl long hair and this does the job! And the curls stay for hours without product&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe about this product is that due to the length of my hair ( small of my back just pass the bra strap) I have to use less than 1/2&amp;#34; of hair or it gets stuck and jammed..a friend w shoulder length hair did 1-1/2 to 2&amp;#34; chunks of hair and it worked for her..I get why but I&#x27;ve got a ton of hair..a quick 10 min process for her, 35-45 mins for me...</li>
    <li> Product that was delivered was fake in obviously opened then resealed packaging</li>
    <li> I have hair that doesn&#x27;t curl.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried (until now), not even my swanky stylist could make the curl hold...But this did it!  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Just received mine and first impression was was pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Its thinner &amp; smaller than I had thought, this is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;2) Its not as heavy as I thought, also a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;3). Did my entire head of hair in less than 45 minutes, my hair is just below the shoulders, its thin &amp; wavy.&lt;br /&gt;4). I made sure to detangle the hair &amp; comb every section before using this item.&lt;br /&gt;5). When it did jam, which was three times, &amp; it got jammed because my sections of hair were a bit thicker.  It was really no big deal, &amp; it automatically releases your hair &amp; you simply lower the wand &amp; your hair is released with no damage.&lt;br /&gt;6). It does get a little hot to the touch around the face area, just made sure not to come to close &amp; when I did, I didn&#x27;t get burnt just felt it&#x27;s heat.&lt;br /&gt;7). Oh &amp; doing the back of my head was very odd.  I had to take the sections of hair &amp; move them toward the side of my head to position the wand upright...Doing the back of my head will take some getting used to but I manage to do it just fine, just felt odd.&lt;br /&gt;7). The one thing I DO NOT like, is the fact the the settings are not listed on the wand; meaning the temperature, timing &amp; curling direction settings are not indicated directly on the wand.  So it&#x27;s important to save the manual should you need to change your settings until you memorize them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first use, I got luxurious lose curly hair, it was easy to use, not too heavy at all.  I did feel the need to grasp it tightly which is not necessary, this is just getting used to it&#x27;s weight.  I didn&#x27;t get burnt, it didn&#x27;t smell burnt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will come back with an up date as I experience with the curling styles &amp; I will also do an up date as to the curl life.</li>
    <li> The most amazing curling machine ever!</li>
    <li> I´m not saying about this seller, but I bought it Mira Curl – Bayliss at amazon.com totally FAKE. The hair tool Stays on just for 10 min.  It smells “ burn” all the time. At the time I ordered the review was very good.  So beware!!!</li>
    <li> I like it and the product arrived in my home at time</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. BeautyAnd sells 100% authentic models and is great at communicating. I was worried about a slight change to the device from original model but was able to confirm with conair that the change was legitimate and that this seller is as well.</li>
    <li> Fake product . Broke in a month.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel I was going to get one and I did. I feel excited and so happy. It came faster than I thought. So happy.</li>
    <li> I love it! Easy to use! I can curl my hair in 25mins, I have thick hair but this truly is a miracurl! For those who have a hard time curling hair</li>
    <li> I love this curler! It is so fast and easy to use. Plus my curls actually stay for days! I would highly recommend it and I&#x27;ve tried all of them out there...</li>
    <li> I think it works well. Wish the curls were bigger, yet it does what it says!</li>
    <li> This curler is really effective if you separate your hair and spray that portion FIRST, before putting it into the machine. This method might be time consuming, but I found it to be the best way to make my curls last. Be careful not to put too much hair into the roller, it will get angry with you and tangle.</li>
    <li> This arrived super fast!  Christmas request from daughter who is super picky about her hair so if she sent it to me to order I know she will love it.</li>
    <li> I got this tried it and my curls have lasted 3 days. Works great.</li>
    <li> I received the regular product</li>
    <li> Ordered mines Oct 31 and received it today ,I was so excited because it came way before the estimated date. And its an excellent product because I don&#x27;t really know how to curl my hair and with this its super easy I love it</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and the result is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Amo esse produto. O cabelo fica maravilhoso e é muito facil de usar!</li>
    <li> worked just as advertised</li>
    <li> Bom equipamento, porem precisa melhorar a segurança. Quando o Cabelo prende o dispositivo continua aquecido podendo causar uma queimadura na região capilar</li>
    <li> Easy to use! Curls last all day. I&#x27;ve tried curling irons, curling wands, curlers and none of them work as great as this product.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It is performing just as expected! I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and the service.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! Curls hair beautifully &amp; does the curling-wrist work for you! (Good for lazy women like myself!)It beeps to let u know curl is ready too, so all curls are perfectly even. Took me about 5seconds to get the hang of it-- to figure out how to not get hair tangled in it lol, but its so so so easy after the first couple strands to learn what not to do! My hair is long and thick with lots of layers, so would barely hold a curl with other appliances and products. With Miracurl it was still curled and beautiful 24 hours later--no lie. Unheard of and amazing! My hairstylist first introduced Miracurl to me, using it for my wedding, and I just had to have one of my own! Ive had mine a month now and loved loved loved how my hair looks everytime I use it! Men, buy this for your wife if she has long hair! Women, buy this for yourself, u will not regret.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, but beware of fakes sold cheaper, the don&#x27;t work, burn your hair and overheat, and they&#x27;re almost impossible to spot until you&#x27;ve used them, the paint rubs off too, always ask the seller if this is a genuine product.</li>
    <li> Everything is OK in this purchase.</li>
