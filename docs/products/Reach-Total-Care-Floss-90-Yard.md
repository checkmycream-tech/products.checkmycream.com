      <li>We liked the number of yards per unit.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is our favorite dental floss at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>Great stuff, worth the price.</li>
      <li>Good and useful.  </li>
      <li>Why is it better?    </li>
      <li>It is very durable and stretchy...a great floss.  </li>
      <li>Like so many others, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review for floss...</li>
      <li>but hey it&#x27;s better on the floss than it is in your mouth.</li>
      <li>I have tried many dental floss from all over the world</li>
      <li>Glad to find a volume supplier.</li>
      <li>I love that it stretches.</li>
      <li>I love this floss.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dental flosses over the years.  </li>
      <li>It seems to pull the gunk out from between my teeth better.  </li>
      <li>I love this floss.</li>
      <li>I can get it around my teeth better</li>
      <li>IT CLEANS OUT THE PLAQUE BETTER THAN ANY FLOSS</li>
      <li>I said almost :)  </li>
      <li>The floss is strong, is flexible, and very easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>Does a much better job, is pleasantly flavored, and it works so well that you don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
      <li>Pretty good deal from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Floss does a great job of wrapping around tooth to effectively remove particles above and below the gum line.</li>
      <li>Was so glad to see that this product was available through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Reach is the best floss I&#x27;ve used - it&#x27;s wide and stretchy and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>taped and mint flavored and easy on the teeth.</li>
      <li>The floss easily fits between teeth and does a thorough job in removing particles.  </li>
      <li>While perhaps not quite as gentle as some of the super-soft Glide products, I feel it is more effective.  </li>
      <li>An amazing advance really.</li>
      <li>I ordered this floss thinking it was the blue REACH wooly floss that does a great job.  </li>
      <li>Slides smoothly between teeth.</li>
      <li>Great product and 3 pack will last us a year.</li>
      <li>Floss is actually surprisingly important to me.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great, quiet and won&#x27;t break.</li>
      <li>I was given a bag of free samples from school and upon trying it myself I can see why they say this.</li>
      <li>Almost makes flossing your teeth fun!</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s like a tape it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;edge\\&quot; that the thinner flosses have, kind of \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; into the gum, but I alternate the different flosses, and I&#x27;m really happy with my cleaner teeth.</li>
      <li>Other brands don&#x27;t compare and it is much more comfortable and effective than string floss.</li>
      <li>I tried Reach Total Care out from a local store and was impressed by the product but not the price.</li>
      <li>Reach is highly recommended by my dentist and the 90-yd box is the most economical.  </li>
      <li>The 90 yard size lasts for over half a year and has a great taste as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a whole new flossing experience, because the tape is kind of sticky.  </li>
      <li>This was recommended by my dentist over the older ribbon floss because the older floss does not remove plaque as effectively.</li>
      <li>This floss is great - it doesn&#x27;t shred and works between tight spaces.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making it available to me.</li>
      <li>Buying the 90-yd pack is economical too.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Seems to clean more significantly more thoroughly than typical floss; pricey for floss, but I consider it inexpensive &amp;#34;preventative care.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It seems to be better in every way than the old fashioned floss and tapes that I&#x27;m used too.</li>
      <li>It leaves your mouth fresh but not feeling minty all day.</li>
      <li>Not only does it rarely break, but it seems to clean better as well.</li>
      <li>He was right on both points.  </li>
      <li>The rubber band texture really grabs the plaque and leaves my teeth feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only kind she will willingly use.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t be going back to the old fashioned kind!</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great product, which has helped turn me into a daily flosser.</li>
      <li>I floss every day and get my teeth cleaned pretty often.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently in dental hygiene school, so I have the plus of being taught why this product is better.</li>
      <li>When you first use this stuff, you will compare the sensation to floss with a rubber band and worry if you have made a mistake.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product I have ever found that makes</li>
      <li>The only way to get the floss out then is to break the top off and unspool it by hand.</li>
      <li>Well, it is stretchy and it has tiny microfiber holes in it to help attract the plaque better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a floss that is really good! You pull it to get it in between the teeth, let it go slack just a very little bit and floss. You&#x27;ll feel the teeth cleaning the sides of your teeth and my dentist loves it. Other flosses just slide over the plaque but this grabs it and pulls it out. Good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED ALMOST EVERY FLOSS ON THE MARKET AND THE SHARP ROOT CANAL EDGES OF MY TEETH SHREAD ALMOST EVERY FLOSS I&#x27;VE TRIED. THIS ONE HANGS ON UNTIL I&#x27;M DONE AND THEN SOME. I HAVE CUT IT A FEW TIMES BUT IT SELDOM HAPPENS. IT CLEANS OUT THE PLAQUE BETTER THAN ANY FLOSS IVE TRIED DUE TO IT&#x27;S PORUS CONSTRUCTION AND GET THE JOB DONE VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> Like so many others, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review for floss...BUT IT&#x27;S THAT AWESOME! Truly the best floss out there!</li>
    <li> This floss works just great for me. It seems to be better in every way than the old fashioned floss and tapes that I&#x27;m used too. Does a much better job, is pleasantly flavored, and it works so well that you don&#x27;t need too much. Won&#x27;t be going back to the old fashioned kind!</li>
    <li> Perfect floss for people with a lot of crowns and fillings between teeth as it does not shred and knot up on the dental work.</li>
    <li> Flossing will never be the same.  This floss is AMAZING!  It&#x27;s kind of like flossing with a rubber band.  Your teeth feel cleaner than when using &#x27;normal&#x27; floss.</li>
    <li> I love this floss. Got it as a sample from my hygienist. Pretty good deal from Amazon. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m terribly sorry for the pun. Look, I&#x27;ve heard people say, \\&quot;floss is floss.\\&quot; Until this product emerged from the Reach laboratories, I just may have sided with them. You&#x27;ll immediately notice how streets ahead the competition this floss really is. Why is it better?    1) It doesn&#x27;t fray. Ever.  2) It&#x27;s just thick enough to deep clean your gums without getting stuck between your teeth.    I really wanted to come up with 3), but we&#x27;re talking about floss, and there&#x27;s just not that much else to say about it.</li>
    <li> This is without doubt the best dental floss on the market.  It is a little expensive, but well worth the price.  The floss is strong, is flexible, and very easy to manage.  Try it once and you will be hooked, if you value your dental health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently in dental hygiene school, so I have the plus of being taught why this product is better. Studies are showing that this floss gets out twice as much plaque as your average floss. Why? Well, it is stretchy and it has tiny microfiber holes in it to help attract the plaque better. I was given a bag of free samples from school and upon trying it myself I can see why they say this. You can SEE the plaque it collects on it, which is disgusting of course but hey it&#x27;s better on the floss than it is in your mouth. When I used to use other brands of floss I never saw plaque on it.     Anyway, as a soon to be dental hygienist and a person who uses this floss myself now ever since my professors taught us about it, I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Was so glad to see that this product was available through Amazon.  We can&#x27;t get it locally, and the three pack is cheaper than buying three individually.</li>
    <li> I have tried every floss out there and this is the best I have found. The rubber band texture really grabs the plaque and leaves my teeth feeling clean.  The only problem is finding it in stores.</li>
    <li> This is the best bang for the buck. I was buying the same product in lesser quantity at the local drug store. When I started buying it from Amazon I found the savings was astronomical. This is the same size they use at my dentist office.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a whole new flossing experience, because the tape is kind of sticky.  It seems to pull the gunk out from between my teeth better.  Because it&#x27;s like a tape it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;edge\\&quot; that the thinner flosses have, kind of \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; into the gum, but I alternate the different flosses, and I&#x27;m really happy with my cleaner teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth have a habit of shredding normal dental floss, and I think that Glide is too slick and doesn&#x27;t remove enough plaque.  This floss seems like the perfect balance of being &#x27;slick&#x27; without being too slick.  It is very durable and stretchy...a great floss.  I bought a lot of it.</li>
    <li> The floss I was using (Glide) started cheaping out and making thin floss that breaks 3-4 times every time I use it. I tried Reach Total Care out from a local store and was impressed by the product but not the price. Not only does it rarely break, but it seems to clean better as well. I looked it up on Amazon, and found it was half the price. (Buying 3-packs of 90 yd instead of single 30 yd packs.) Great deal for great floss.</li>
    <li> This floss was able to do the impossible: get me to floss every day. Flossing is an awkward chore that I admit I didn&#x27;t do as often as I should, but this floss has made it go a lot faster and my dental hygienist has commented that it seems to be doing a great job. I really like how elastic it is. I can get it around my teeth better and I don&#x27;t feel like the blood supply to my fingers is being slowly cut off with each wrap of the old string floss. The 90 yard 3-pack is an excellent way to save money too.</li>
    <li> I love this floss. It has a great stretchiness to it that makes it easy to use and has a texture that gently scours the build up without irritating gums! Dentist recommended it and I&#x27;m glad she did!</li>
    <li> Great floss, a little pricey and tough to get it rolling out the first time, but once you open it and fix it a little rolls out fine. Have not  tried using the other three yet, so Im not sure if the problem was only the first one.</li>
    <li> Floss does a great job of wrapping around tooth to effectively remove particles above and below the gum line.</li>
    <li> Last time I buy these in bulk...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve opened 2 of the 3 packages that came with this pack and they both immediately jammed up. The only way to get the floss out then is to break the top off and unspool it by hand. It doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal, but it doubles the hassle of flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little QA, Reach?</li>
    <li> I floss every day and get my teeth cleaned pretty often. Floss is actually surprisingly important to me. This is the only floss that isn&#x27;t a compromise. Every other floss I&#x27;ve used (perhaps 10 other types) is either too slippery (doesn&#x27;t get stuck but does nothing) or too sticky (cleans well but breaks and gets stuck in my teeth). This floss cleans effectively and in two months I&#x27;ve managed to break it only 3 times and I&#x27;m not especially gentle with it. It&#x27;s a single, slightly elastic, slightly sticky ribbon that doesn&#x27;t leave bits of itself behind in your teeth. An amazing advance really.</li>
    <li> I ordered this floss thinking it was the blue REACH wooly floss that does a great job.  This stuff is like stretchy fishing line. It bounces and snaps from between your teeth like a transparent rubber band. I will use it to tie my tomato plants. What a waste money.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this type of floss in stores. Great product and 3 pack will last us a year. Doesn&#x27;t fray like the Teflon type flosses</li>
    <li> This floss is great. I love that it stretches. Slides smoothly between teeth. Almost makes flossing your teeth fun! I said almost :)  The only critique I have is that the wax sometimes flakes off and is a little annoying. Great stuff, worth the price.</li>
    <li> Good and useful.  Worth it and many thanks to our dentist for introducing us to this the other day. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I used Glide for as long as it&#x27;s been around until I got a sample of this from my dentist and now this is all I use.</li>
    <li> This is some terrible floss. For those out there who floss daily, what do you rely on? Tension. Yes ma&#x27;am, tension. And what do you get with this floss??? Suspension. You might think you can throw this floss around and get into the nitty gritty like you&#x27;d like, but no. It will bend and stretch like you&#x27;d like. And you get nothing in return. I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I floss I like to FLOSS where I can get into those trouble areas where brushing don&#x27;t get to. So bottom line folks, this floss stretches, like really stretches. I&#x27;d recommend the simple as simple comes floss, don&#x27;t waste your time on fancy stuff, just go with some good brushing and some good ole home flossing.</li>
    <li> This floss is great - it doesn&#x27;t shred and works between tight spaces. It&#x27;s hard to find in the local drugstore.</li>
    <li> Reach is the best floss I&#x27;ve used - it&#x27;s wide and stretchy and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;And the 90 Yard pack - which has available refills if you can find them - is the best deal for the family bathroom.</li>
    <li> My favorite floss and I am a dental hygienist!</li>
    <li> Slightly elastic stretch, doesn&#x27;t cut off circulation in your fingers, nice minty flavor, and has little grooves that really get the job done. Once you fall in love with it and want to stock up, definitely go for the 90-yard three-pack.</li>
    <li> Seems silly to like a kind of dental floss, but this is thick enough not to hurt my fingers. Worth the extra cost, and a bit container like this makes it not too bad.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss I&#x27;ve found to work due to tight teeth and adherent plaque.  The other floss has gotten stuck between my teeth and broken, but not this!  Great product!  Glad to find a volume supplier.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss EVER.  It does not get stuck between my teeth.  It is thin enough to do the job but doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy residue (because it&#x27;s not waxed).  Lifetime customer here.</li>
    <li> Best floss ever.  Since I changed to reach total care floss I don&#x27;t like any of the other brands.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dental floss from all over the world but nothing like this one. taped and mint flavored and easy on the teeth. look no further. I am addicted to this floss</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed in the economy size Walgreens no longer carries.  Total Care is soft and wide enough to prevent cutting your gums.</li>
    <li> Seems to clean more significantly more thoroughly than typical floss; pricey for floss, but I consider it inexpensive &amp;#34;preventative care.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is the best floss out there. Other brands don&#x27;t compare and it is much more comfortable and effective than string floss. 270 yds should last me the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> What happened to this product?  I can no long find it in stores.  And now it&#x27;s selling for almost $70 for a three pack?  WTF?</li>
    <li> I just went to re-order this product and the price has tripled in a year!  I think it&#x27;s no longer being made.  It was/is the best floss out there and this was the best price around.</li>
    <li> This floss is the brand favored by my periodontist.  These 90-yard rolls are much longer than I can find in walk-in stores, and even with shipping, in the three-pack, much cheaper than in the walk-in stores.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist over the older ribbon floss because the older floss does not remove plaque as effectively. The rougher surface found in this product does feel like it is scrubbing better while the tape is still thin enough to get in between tight teeth. A bit pricy but appears to work well.</li>
    <li> This is the best dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is more expensive than most but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This floss was getting hard to find in the local stores.  It has an elastic consistency rather than the string or smooth tape of other floss.  I have such tightly spaced teeth that regular floss breaks and frays between my teeth, making it difficult to get the broken bits of floss, leaving me with that uncomfortable feeling of something stuck in my teeth.  The floss has never got caught in my teeth when it has broken and it seems to do as good a job as the other types of floss.</li>
    <li> We liked the number of yards per unit.  Convenient.&lt;br /&gt;It is our favorite dental floss at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;We shall order more later.</li>
    <li> Except for the very, very few lucky ones, flossing is mandatory.  If you want to maintain healthy teeth for the long run, you have to do it. So, why not use some of the best and easiest floss I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it can be held between your fingers without slipping. Second, it slides between teeth as easy as its competitors. Third, it is oddly stretchy and grabby, which helps clean material off the tooth surface. Finally, It is rather difficult to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful... Like any other other floss, you must keep it away from pets and wildlife and dispose of used material properly.</li>
    <li> After years of having dentists preach the virtues of regular flossing, my poor habits finally caught up with me.  At a recent exam, I was told that my gums were in poor condition, and that if I couldn&#x27;t get them to shape up on my own, more involved methods may be in order.  The dentist recommended this brand, touting both its comfort and effectiveness.  He was right on both points.  While perhaps not quite as gentle as some of the super-soft Glide products, I feel it is more effective.  As to the elasticity others have mentioned, I personally like the little snap you get when pulling the floss out from between your teeth.  Overall, this is a great product, which has helped turn me into a daily flosser.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product at Shands dental clinic in Gainesvile, Fl.  It is a great product and I will reorder it again.&lt;br /&gt;Gator1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a drawer full of various types of dental floss that I&#x27;ve tried over the years. I like this one the best. Does not shred in tight spots like woven, but it will sometimes break if you force it too much. I can&#x27;t always find it in stores so instead of having to hunt for it I just stock up from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to use only woven dental floss but it was hard to find locally some what pricey online so I gave this a try about 2 years ago.  I have been using it ever since.  Still not the least expensive floss out there it is comfortable to use, lasts a really long time, and the fact that I can buy it in a 3 pack means I can almost go a year before having to restock.</li>
    <li> the best floss ever!  love it!  good for teeth that are close together, as well as not.  expensive but worth it!</li>
    <li> I started using this floss several years ago because it was a little thicker than most floss and it didn&#x27;t break while I was flossing. Unfortunately, just like so many other products, the manufacturer appears to have cut quality and increased the price. It&#x27;s not made like it used to be and I would recommend that you not buy it.</li>
    <li> This is a large amount of floss, should last much longer than the smaller packs of similar product.  Would buy again, but I won&#x27;t run out for awhile.</li>
    <li> I hate the sound of regular dental floss scraping against my teeth. This stuff is great, quiet and won&#x27;t break. Buying the 90-yd pack is economical too.</li>
    <li> The floss is of very good quality. It will not break or fray after use. Will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few different types of floss and none of them have been as comfortable as reach total care floss. It will never split, fray, or break, and it is so thin that it can get between even the closest of teeth. I have never injured my gums using this item and have never found myself in any pain whatsoever like i have with other brands of floss. The mint flavor is not overpowering like a lot of other dental products. It leaves your mouth fresh but not feeling minty all day. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a brand of floss but just haven&#x27;t found the right brand for themselves yet.</li>
    <li> When you first use this stuff, you will compare the sensation to floss with a rubber band and worry if you have made a mistake.  After about a week, you will never return to the standard high-end floss.  The floss easily fits between teeth and does a thorough job in removing particles.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Flexible material with microfibers designed to remove debris.  Will not damage gums like some firm floss will.&lt;br /&gt;Tape design enhances the comfort.</li>
    <li> tough but resilient floss. Cleans well. Long enough so that it last a reasonable time in our household. I use small packs for travel.</li>
    <li> Reach is highly recommended by my dentist and the 90-yd box is the most economical.  Of course, Target stopped carrying it.  I was getting it from Amazon on a regular basis as part of Subscribe &amp; Save, but they have recently discontinued the practice for the product which is sad.  I am glad, though, that I can still get the product at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best floss on the market. Gets through tight spaces without shredding. It is also pleasant tasting.</li>
    <li> My teeth are very tightly spaced. Most floss shreds, or does a poor job. This floss holds together and cleans out the junk.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this particular floss in my surrounding area, so purchase it on line.  Thanks for making it available to me.</li>
    <li> I started flossing regularly because of this floss.  My teeth are tight, and this allows for smooth flossing without getting stuck.  The strength lets me use it rather vigorously without worrying about snapping or fraying.</li>
    <li> I find pieces of floss all over the house. I ordered her three football field lengths of Reach Total Care. It&#x27;s the only kind she will willingly use. As soon as I run out of my Glide Pro-Health, which is good, I&#x27;ll probably start using hers. She&#x27;s got plenty.</li>
    <li> I have never loved to floss.  Other Flosses often break or shred.  This is the first product I have ever found that makes&lt;br /&gt;you actually like to floss.</li>
    <li> This floss really polishes off those pearly whites and has some give so it doesn&#x27;t tear up your gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dental flosses over the years.  Most snap or are cut by sharp edges on my teeth.  Although this is not perfect, it works better than any I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The 90 yard size lasts for over half a year and has a great taste as well.</li>
    <li> This floss is superior to any we have used - ever.  It doesn&#x27;t break off while in use so you won&#x27;t find yourself with floss stuck between your teeth.  Yuk!  Terrific!</li>
