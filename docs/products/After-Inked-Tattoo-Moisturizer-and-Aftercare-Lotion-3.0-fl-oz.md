      <li>I got a super colorful tattoo and used this</li>
      <li>This stuff is great - feels nice, smells lovely &amp; if it&#x27;s the reason that the annoying healing stage was so damn quick, then it&#x27;s a miracle moisturizer!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use anything else for my fresh tattoos</li>
      <li>I got a sample from my tattoo artist after some recent ink, and really liked the product.</li>

    <li> This is AMAZING for tattoos! I got a sample from my tattoo artist, and when it was gone I had to buy more. Makes old tattoos look more vibrant, and is great for healing tattoos, keeping them hydrated and helps with itching. Also goes a long way, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Best tattoo care product out there, helps stop the itching too.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use now after getting fresh ink and for continued care. I was introduced to this product a few years ago and I&#x27;ve never looked back. Best used as soon as the tattoo has scabbed and a small amount rubbed gently into the skin every time it starts to feel dry really helps to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; everything.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! I don&#x27;t use anything else for my fresh tattoos</li>
    <li> I  got this lotion to take care of the tattoo I got. Guess what? It goes way, way farther than tattoos. I use a little around my nose during winter to keep it moisturized. It is the only lotion I have ever found that keeps my face from breaking out. I use it on my heels, on my hands and anywhere that is dry. It keeps my tattoo absolutely moist. You have to try this whether or not you have a tattoo. It is 100% cruelty free and vegan. Paraben free, fragrance free, gluten free and non-petroleum. You will love it. I promise.</li>
    <li> Irritated my skin! If you fair sensative skin you may want to try another product.</li>
    <li> It does a pretty good job in helping with the healing process, but only after peeling is mostly over. You should still use Aquaphor up to that point. Also, this lotion irritated my graylines a lot. I had to switch back to the Aquaphor for those sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it smells nice, and it&#x27;s a lotion. Probably not worth its price tag over other quality name brand lotions.</li>
    <li> Happy customer! Great tattoo moisturizer without being goopy like an ointment. Also, my partner and I both noticed that it brought out the color. Will order again. Thanks After Inked!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I have yet to try it on a fresh tattoo because I am scared of having it become infected since some of my tattoos have become infected in the past but either way it makes the ones I already have look nice and it smells really good too.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick lotion. Absorbs quickly. Doesn&#x27;t sting. Leaves my tattoo moisturized for hours. Used it on a fresh one and it was a great product.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th tattoo &amp; my 1st time using After Inked. Usually the really annoying scabby stage lasts a week or two for me, but this time it was just 3 or 4 days - I&#x27;m assuming After Inked was the difference. This stuff is great - feels nice, smells lovely &amp; if it&#x27;s the reason that the annoying healing stage was so damn quick, then it&#x27;s a miracle moisturizer! My artist also says it&#x27;s great to keep using to maintain color, so I&#x27;ll be doing that.</li>
    <li> I really liked it, didn&#x27;t have a lotion - y feel too it but it moisturized my tattoo really well and turned out looking really good, after my 1st tattoo got infected, I got nervous on what I needed to put on it so I spent a little extra and got after inked after I read all the good reviews on here. And I was very happy with my purchase. I will be ordering more when I run out!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for keeping your tattoos from fading.  Not cheap, but after two years of use, my ink still looks fresh.</li>
    <li> Keeps my tat moisturized and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading</li>
    <li> All organic, much better than a&amp;d or aquaphor. I used it during and after the heal process on my last two tattoos. I healed a lot faster than normal, took about a week. Great moisturizer</li>
    <li> Works great and much cheaper here than the tattoo shop.</li>
    <li> Totally helps my tattoo healing process and seems like they heal twice as fast. I am working on a huge back piece so this product feels nice, no build up, and immediately absorbs into skin. I recommend it for anyone getting tattoos regularly that values a great product.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I picked up the sample size at a tattoo show and used it for my wrist piece. The cream felt so good during the healing process I bought more once I was all out.</li>
    <li> this is 100% my favorite tattoo aftercare product. i use it immediately after my tattoo all the way through until its fully healed. i like the non greasy way it drys while still leaving my skin and new tattoo feeling moisturized and refreshed.  i also really love hustle butter as a tattoo after care and daily use moisturizer. the hustle butter does however have a slight greasy feel to it.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  Best after care around.</li>
    <li> I am well inked and this is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lotion after a tattoo.  I have VERY sensitive skin and After Inked helps me manage the post-tattoo healing.  Excellent lotion.</li>
    <li> I got a sample from my tattoo artist after some recent ink, and really liked the product. The 3 oz size is lasting a long time. I would re-purchase. It seems to do a better job than other good quality lotions I have tried. It is not sticky, and does not stain clothes.</li>
    <li> Keeps my tattoos nice and moisturized. A little bit goes a long way. I use it on new and old tattoos alike.</li>
    <li> Not only did great when my new tattoo was healing but is also great on my existing tats. Keeps them looking like new!</li>
    <li> Worked great I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I got my first tube after getting inked at a tattoo convention. I&#x27;ve kept a tube on hand since then for all new tats. It&#x27;s the only thing I use. It won&#x27;t ruin clothes or sheets. Amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> Better than tattoo goo, love this , basically same ingredients as burts bees</li>
    <li> Love this lotion so much.  I bought it for a new tattoo and ended up buying another for a friend.  A little goes a long way and there is no sticky residue or strong scent.  Will definitely continue to purchase after tattoo heals for dry/sunburnt skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m actually using it for my eye cream -- replaced a much much more expensive product. Works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome... My tattoos look brand new</li>
    <li> good quality and no parabens! has good ingredients and goes on smooth. this is the best one ive found!</li>
    <li> Excellent product recieved on time</li>
    <li> I got a super colorful tattoo and used this and the color has faded. I uses it on a new tattoo and it&#x27;s making it scab very badly. I don&#x27;t know if it has anything to do with my very sensitive skin but none of my tattoos have had this happen til I started using this. And I have quite a few tattoos so I know how to take care if them.</li>
    <li> Good natural product a little thick tho for me</li>
    <li> Best product EVER!  Its a must have!</li>
    <li> Wow..great product...repeat buy ...use for large leg tat...keeps colors bright and good for skin and does not harm the ink.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for year and it heals a tattoo fast.</li>
    <li> used this for years. It is the best product.</li>
    <li> this is a perfect moisturizer for after tattoo care. it is soothing, smooth and creamy but not greasy or sticky, and absorbs nicely into my skin. all of the ingredients are natural and the scent is really nice ... very light and clean. for me, this worked much better for tattoo after care than any of the other moisturizers that are sometimes recommended. also, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works well and only requires a small amount.</li>
    <li> This was nice feeling at first but after a couple days it broke out my skin into a horrible rash, so now I have a still healing tattoo that burns like hell. I would be really careful using this especially if you have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve had reactions to products with beeswax or honey in the past and its not an uncommon skin allergy, so please do a test before you use.</li>
    <li> Works great no greasy feeling or oily I will buy again when I run out perfect for tattoos after care</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. it way better then a&amp;d for your tattoos. a most buy for anyone getting or all ready have tattoos</li>
    <li> exactly what i was looking for</li>
    <li> Great for new and old tattoos!</li>
    <li> Worked well on my tattoos, but wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I had hoped. Felt like it wore off about a half hour on fresh tattoos. Might be much better for the 3-4 days after. I wanted to use this for sleeping so I wouldn&#x27;t have aquaphor all over my sheets if possible.</li>
    <li> Great stuff - I highly recommend it on your new ink.</li>
    <li> Man this stuff is the best I will not use any other moisturizer on another one of my tattoos.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I recently got a medium-size tat which ran over my wrist onto my hand and involved a fair amount of finer lines, etc. Thanks to After Inked, it has healed at twice the speed of my earlier tat and -- barring the differences in location and size -- with far less overall aggravation and itching. Even after applying generously for a minimum of 3-4 times a day over 4+ weeks, I still have at least half the tube left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current seller, Top Shelf Barber, was ace, too. In fact, had Amazon not screwed up my requested (and paid for) expedited shipping, I would have had a totally perfect experience with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will definitely be buying again as a maintenance lotion -- and will know to be sure to have some on hand for the next tattoo!</li>
    <li> Have used each time I get a new tat and it does seem to help the healing process move along. I would highly recommend this product for after ink care.</li>
    <li> Always will use this for my ink, 3rd bottle ordered</li>
    <li> Great from start to finish of the healing process. No need to use oily aquaphor or A and D anymore, this is all you need. For the first day or two i used this about 4-5 times but went down to 2-3 after that. I saw a significant decrease in healing time with the tattoo peeling in about 4 days and the colors seemed to stay darker than with other healing methods i have used.</li>
    <li> Package came on time and the product worked wonderfully, my tattoo healed very quickly and stayed moisturized longer without any mess or problems.</li>
