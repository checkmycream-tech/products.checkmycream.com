      <li>it´s really bright and girly, i highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t go this bold with a fingernail color (I am fair skinned) but it looks great!  </li>

      <li>Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured!</li>
      <li>I especially like this color because it reminds me more of a spring color.  </li>
      <li>but I really like it.</li>
      <li>This color on the screen comes off more pink than what I felt it was in person.</li>
      <li>I ran out of my original bottle sometime last year and have been on the hunt  for another.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more red than it seems in the picture but has a nice pink tint to it.  </li>
      <li>This color is a little more brighter than others I have</li>
      <li>This is a pretty color but it looks very orangey especially in the sunlight.</li>
      <li>I must own at least 100 different shades.</li>
      <li>It is not a red red, it is very orangey.</li>
      <li>The polish shipped much sooner than promised (arrived in 2-3 days rather than the expected 6-8 days).</li>
      <li>I just had a professional mani done with OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Red lights ahead...</li>
      <li>no matter how many base/top coats you apply, which makes it not worth the effort at least for me.</li>
      <li>I recomend this to anyone that wants to add a little pop to their apperance.</li>

    <li> I LOVE THIS COLOR!! IT&#x27;S SUCH A WONDERFUL COLOR FOR SUMMER!!! I RECEIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER!!!! THIS WILL BE MY GO TO COLOR FOR SUMMER!</li>
    <li> I just had a professional mani done with OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Red lights ahead...where?\\&quot; and can I say I am obsessed with this color now!  I am so looking forward to wearing this all summer long- I have a new pair of red skinny jeans that match perfectly with this!  The color is more on the orange side of red but very bright and highly pigmented.  I usually don&#x27;t go this bold with a fingernail color (I am fair skinned) but it looks great!  Two coats look exactly like the color in the bottle, and the coverage is nothing less than to be expected by OPI.</li>
    <li> I had tried a sample of this color from my aunt so I decided to order this. Love the color!</li>
    <li> I saw this color based off of a youtube video about how to get a good manicure. This color on the screen comes off more pink than what I felt it was in person. It&#x27;s more of a red orange to me, but it&#x27;s still a pretty color.</li>
    <li> I love this color. And it is actually way cooler than depicted in the photo above. I ran out of my original bottle sometime last year and have been on the hunt  for another. Found it online and am happy to have it back. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite nail polish color .</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Color, texture, everything was good about this purchase. Recommend seller. Had no issues. For a good price too.</li>
    <li> the color is really great, however, it chips within 1-2 days no matter how many base/top coats you apply, which makes it not worth the effort at least for me. I don&#x27;t plan on buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty color but it looks very orangey especially in the sunlight. It is not a red red, it is very orangey.</li>
    <li> I love this color from OPI, is a really nice summer shade. it´s really bright and girly, i highly recommend it!!</li>

    <li> This is a GREAT Color.  It&#x27;s a little more red than it seems in the picture but has a nice pink tint to it.  It&#x27;s a great everyday color.  I&#x27;m a big fan OPI nail color....I must own at least 100 different shades. This shade in particular is one of my most favorite! If you&#x27;re looking for that perfect color to compliment any skin color and any outfit this is the one.</li>
    <li> I especially like this color because it reminds me more of a spring color.  I like to wear reds during winter and red blends during spring.  This color is a little more brighter than others I have but I really like it.</li>
