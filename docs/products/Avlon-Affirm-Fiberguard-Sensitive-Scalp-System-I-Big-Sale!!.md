      <li>I absolutely love Affirm!</li>
      <li>(NONE!!!)and best of all my hair is BONE STRAIGHT and so SHINY.</li>
      <li>However, I really liked the sustenence.</li>
      <li>I used to use it many years ago, and I am glad to know that Avlon still produces exceptional products.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to say that for the FIRST time ever in 25 years, there was NO tingling, burning or stinging</li>
      <li>If you have a sensitive scalp and easy breakage this is a great product!</li>
      <li>However when I started doing my own hair using Precise</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite relaxer system.</li>
      <li>my hair never quite felt as healthy.  </li>
      <li>Affirm my hair looks and feels extremely healthy again.</li>
      <li>probably because I&#x27;ve been relaxed for so many decades.</li>
      <li>The relaxer is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have been using Avlon products since 2012 and this entire system is great.</li>
      <li>I am happy to say that the now that I am back to using Avlon</li>
      <li>, so I recommend avoiding I Enjoy Beauty.</li>
      <li>I decided it was time to make a switch from using Precise Relaxing system to Avlon.  </li>
      <li>I measured for and used the mild formulation which really did a great job of getting my hair straight.</li>
      <li>Loved it easy to use last me over 7 months</li>
      <li>The first time my hair was relaxed, 7 years ago, my hairdresser used Avlon Affirm and  my hair was healthy.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was quick and all the items were securely wrapped.</li>
      <li>This pack is a great deal, as you get all the other items you need.</li>
      <li>It is shiny, but most of all, it isn&#x27;t dry and it&#x27;s very strong.  </li>
      <li>I also have never been able to follow the rules about never scratching my scalp because it seems that when my roots are growing in and I get closer to the time for a touch up, my head itches me the most!!---Another thing that creates a high probability for tingling and burning.</li>
      <li>I permed my hair last weekend and honestly my hair is like &#x27;wig hair&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for over a year now, my hair is so healthy and it works well for my sensitive scalp</li>
      <li>it is very easy to use professional or not the mixture is not hard to do</li>
      <li>Last more that a year</li>
      <li>I ordered the 9-application pack, and used two of them the first time.</li>
      <li>The preserve (my first time using the product) kept my relaxed ends from getting damaged.  </li>
      <li>This does exactly what it says it will.</li>
      <li>After 25 years of relaxing my hair with various brands of relaxers including other sensitive scalp types and so-called kiddie perms, I decided to try Affirm Fiberguard after hearing so many good things about the product.</li>
      <li>I tried going natural but found that was far more work for me</li>
      <li>Also my scalp is very tender which makes tingling a higher probability.</li>
      <li>I have issues with dermatitis, which causes my hair to break after it grows to a certain point.  </li>
      <li>The order was well&#x3D;packaged with everything included though I did order the Gentle Assurance</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>my hair is really straight when I get through also</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I will never use anything else and comparing the cost I&#x27;ve spent at the salon, I couldn&#x27;t have found a better price.  </li>
      <li>The only thing is I find that even at normal strength it still seemed pretty mild.  </li>
      <li>but it certainly was better than others I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
      <li>Packaged carefully and accurately.</li>
      <li>My hair felt really smooth and soft for the first few day.</li>
      <li>My hair has been beautiful since switching to the Fiberguard relaxer, and is currently past my shoulders with minimal breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Avlon!!!</li>
      <li>and I have very sensitive scalp and tender headed</li>
      <li>My hair feel straight and the perm seems to have taken, but after that when I run my fingers through my hair starting at the scalp I feel new growth.</li>
      <li>hair has always required a relaxer that was mild, so for the several times I used this product thats how I mixed it.</li>
      <li>I wanted a product to loosen my hair, not straighten it completely.</li>
      <li>Since I cannot afford to use Phytospecific relaxer, I researched my options and found Affirm Fiberguard Sensitive Scalp.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B004CG0RLK Avlon Affirm Fiberguard Sensitive Scalp System</li>
      <li>I which I had not wasted my money.</li>
      <li>If you want your hair completely relaxed, you can just leave it on the fully recommended time.</li>
      <li>Thinner than the ready mixed</li>
      <li>when I take my braids out my hair I can use this relaxer directly after</li>
      <li>My beautician uses Affirm, but it couldnt possible be this exact same one.</li>
      <li>Anyway with some skepticism I followed the Affirm Fiberguard instructions carefully and mixed in the amount of activator to achieve the mild formula.</li>
      <li>My hair is not breaking, is not dry, has not reverted, and is soft and well conditioned.</li>
      <li>The product was delivered fast and it was everything I expected.</li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling soft and manageable.  </li>

    <li> I permed my hair last weekend and honestly my hair is like &#x27;wig hair&#x27;.  It is shiny, but most of all, it isn&#x27;t dry and it&#x27;s very strong.  The preserve (my first time using the product) kept my relaxed ends from getting damaged.  I have arthritis so I am slow to work the relaxer through, but my scalp was protected and my hair got straight.  I will never use anything else and comparing the cost I&#x27;ve spent at the salon, I couldn&#x27;t have found a better price.  I saved a 1/2 day of vacation,  a 1/4 tank of gas, plus the $75 dollars for the actual service  and $10 tip.  You cannot go wrong if you follow the directions.  Great products.</li>
    <li> Awesome Relaxer ~ Easy to Apply ~ No Burning ~ Healthy Hair</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best relaxer I&#x27;ve used but it certainly was better than others I&#x27;ve tried in the past. My hair felt really smooth and soft for the first few day. Unfortunately, after about the third day, it felt dry and stiff. I am not sure if it was over processed or not. However, I really liked the sustenence. It made my hair feel like silk when applied. It is a great conditioner and a must buy.</li>
    <li> Excelente la compra de los productos... Envio rapido y excelente producto... Seguire comprando con ustedes en el futuro. Los he recomendado a todos quienes usan ese tipo de producto. Gracias mil!</li>

I ordered from Ugly Beauty. They are a little slow on the shipping compared to Amazon&#x27;s usual fast service; it took a week and a half to receive my order. The order was well&#x3D;packaged with everything included though I did order the Gentle Assurance separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend Avlon Affirm Fiberguard Sensitive  Scalp Relaxer purchased from Ugly Beauty.</li>
    <li> After 25 years of relaxing my hair with various brands of relaxers including other sensitive scalp types and so-called kiddie perms, I decided to try Affirm Fiberguard after hearing so many good things about the product. Well I can now attest to it myself: I always relax at home and my hair is APL so I tend to move slower than the time limits for leaving a relaxer in and it usually begins to tingle (sometimes burning) before I have finished applying the product. Also my scalp is very tender which makes tingling a higher probability. I also have never been able to follow the rules about never scratching my scalp because it seems that when my roots are growing in and I get closer to the time for a touch up, my head itches me the most!!---Another thing that creates a high probability for tingling and burning. Anyway with some skepticism I followed the Affirm Fiberguard instructions carefully and mixed in the amount of activator to achieve the mild formula.

I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and I trust none other. Get the desired results by measuring the activator to adjust the strength. All that you need to relax a beautiful head of hair is right in this very nice package.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product as described. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite relaxer system. When I get done with my hair it does not feel like straw, it is well conditioned. Too bad they don&#x27;t sell it near me.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the money. Packaged carefully and accurately. I will definitely continue to order!</li>
    <li> If you have a sensitive scalp and easy breakage this is a great product! I have been using Avlon products since 2012 and this entire system is great.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004CG0RLK Avlon Affirm Fiberguard Sensitive Scalp System I Big Sale!!]]&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always required a relaxer that was mild, so for the several times I used this product thats how I mixed it. I do have highlights in my hair so it is often on the dry side. My hair feel straight and the perm seems to have taken, but after that when I run my fingers through my hair starting at the scalp I feel new growth. My beautician uses Affirm, but it couldnt possible be this exact same one. I like how the Affirm relaxer makes my hair feel...but this particular one my hair just sucks up when I apply it. I assume that bc my hair is thick that this specific one is not right for my hair type.I which I had not wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says it will. I will continue to use these products for both me and my daughter.</li>
    <li> this was a great product, I love it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years on my color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I decided it was time to make a switch from using Precise Relaxing system to Avlon.  The first time my hair was relaxed, 7 years ago, my hairdresser used Avlon Affirm and  my hair was healthy.  However when I started doing my own hair using Precise my hair never quite felt as healthy.  I am happy to say that the now that I am back to using Avlon Affirm my hair looks and feels extremely healthy again. No excess shedding or breakage or burning during the relaxer process.</li>
    <li> Must order again, great deal... Last more that a year</li>
    <li> Loved it easy to use last me over 7 months and I shared some of the containers. my scalp does not burn when using this. no breakage the good thing about this is even when I take my braids out my hair I can use this relaxer directly after and I have very sensitive scalp and tender headed as well so I would say this product is very safe and good for your hair. my hair is really straight when I get through also it is very easy to use professional or not the mixture is not hard to do</li>
    <li> Thinner than the ready mixed but does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Good product. Would buy again.kit has all that you needs.</li>
    <li> This product was fairly simply to use.  It left my hair feeling soft and manageable.  The only thing is I find that even at normal strength it still seemed pretty mild.  I don&#x27;t mind but it but some of you with different hair types might not like this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now, my hair is so healthy and it works well for my sensitive scalp</li>

    <li> Great bargain to be had with purchase! Will use this for the next 2 years!</li>
    <li> I wanted a product to loosen my hair, not straighten it completely. My hairdresser tried several others, but they didn&#x27;t give me the look or feel that I was looking for. My cousin in Texas recommended the Affirm Fiberguard, and it was perfect! I ordered the 9-application pack, and used two of them the first time. This pack is a great deal, as you get all the other items you need. If you want your hair completely relaxed, you can just leave it on the fully recommended time. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
