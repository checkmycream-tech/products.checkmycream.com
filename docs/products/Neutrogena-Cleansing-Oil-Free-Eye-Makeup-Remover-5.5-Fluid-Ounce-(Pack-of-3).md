    <li> I love this eye makeup remover.  I have given up on any other brands.  This is just the best.  I always wear waterproof mascara and this removes it with ease.  No pulling or tugging.  Love it. HG eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This remains my favorite eye makeup remover. My eyes are incredible sensitive and I have problems with almost every remover out there. My eyes will sting, itch or water if I try to use anything but this. It&#x27;s incredibly gentle and never irritates my eyes. I use it on a cotton pad to remove makeup and then swipe the other side of the pad quickly under warm water and wipe my eye one last time. This removes the sort of &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; residue left by the remover. It works very well on even waterproof mascara and eyeliner, too.</li>

    <li> As usual... this is my only go-to eye makeup remover product.  I haven&#x27;t found anything else I like.  This takes off stubborn waterproof mascara well.  It has like an oil/water mixture you can see in the bottle.  Putting a small amount on a cotton ball does the trick..  No need to rub hard either.  I like buying this in bulk, because I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> great product, removes make up easily. no build up. arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena Cleansing Oil-Free Eye Make up remover is truly one of the best eyeliner/mascara removers that I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just pour some on a cotton ball, soak it on my eyelids for 30seconds, and then wipe. Almost all of my eyeliner, comes off immediately afterwards.</li>
