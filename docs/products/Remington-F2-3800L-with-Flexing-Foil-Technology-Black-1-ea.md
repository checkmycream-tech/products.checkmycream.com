      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and a great price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cost effective</li>
      <li>however I find this does the job perfectly well and don&#x27;t feel the need to spend that much.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if Remington had included a multi-voltage charger (100-240 VAC, 50/60 Hz), but that might have driven the price up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fitting in the hand like the proverbial glove, the Remington F2-3800L shaver looks as good as it fits.  </li>

      <li>wow this works perfect</li>

      <li>It is easy to clean and the size if great.</li>

      <li>like the Remington foil shavers better than rotary shavers.</li>

      <li>The F5 is much better all around</li>

      <li>This razor like all foil razors, works best on short stubble.</li>
      <li>THE EA- 307 WAS MUCH BETTER ,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love this shaver because the top blade does not provide a close shave.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>Problem is the shave is just ok.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It shaves my face.  I keep buying the cheap remington 2-foil razors because they do the job and last a year or two.</li>
    <li> works great love the razor purchased it for $18.70 instead of buying the blades for $15$.99</li>
    <li> took about 2 1/2 weeks for face to adjust to it , works as well as expected for the price.</li>
    <li> The price/performance ratio is very good. A bit noisy</li>
    <li> No way to beat it for the price. And way faster than rotary shavers.  I&#x27;m taking a star away.  The battery ain&#x27;t much force.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for under 6 month.  I shave every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor doesn&#x27;t really get all that close which is exactly what I was looking for due to ingrown hairs on my neck . . . so for me that&#x27;s a pro and not a con.  having used many foil razors in the past, I would say that this is average for closeness and speed of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that bothers me is how quickly the foil got holes in it and I&#x27;m back looking for parts when appear to be consumables.  It&#x27;s also very loud to the point where I have to repeatedly turn it off in the morning if there is on going conversation and ask for repeats.</li>
    <li> A perfect shave!  Why spend more money for a big name?</li>
    <li> Very poor quality - spend a little more to get something that works well.  I have purchased several of Remington&#x27;s low end razors over the years and watched the quality decline. I returned the last one I bought in late 2014 as it was simply worthless - very noisy, poor shave, can&#x27;t handle thick stubble, 16 hour charge time and 30/min run time.  I upgraded to the F5 category at around $55 bucks and am very happy with that product.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. He claims to like it, the shave seems close. It is a tad bit loud but moat foil razors seem to be</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington shavers since about 1980 and IMHO this is best one they&#x27;ve ever made, combining the best features of the past into a solid but light - 4.9oz shaver, 3.7oz adapter and cord - and an inexpensive package. It is a little noisy and vibrates a lot, but very fast, meaning it cuts well. The cutters and screens are joined like the older model, but the cutter is joined to the shaft better, a problem in them. The trimmer has been separated from it, Braun-style, eliminating drag and saving battery, thus the batteries may be smaller than recent models, but still provide at least four ten-minute shaves. When depleted, speed drops off sharply, and without warning, but this is easily remedied by adopting a charging schedule, for instance, Wed or Thurs, and Sat or Sun overnight. Not good to leave NiCd batteries on a charger or charge too fast, anyway. Batteries should be depleted and recharged twice a year to prevent shaping. It hasn&#x27;t got a pivot head, but who always shaves up and down, over even with a circular motion as they always recommend? It doesn&#x27;t have a charging stand, but who wants to pack that? It doesn&#x27;t self-clean, but who needs it? Shaving immediately after washing will produce the best results, and keep oils out of the head. Just remove the head, which it does more easily and positively than more recent Remingtons, and blow it out before putting away. Brush once in a while if powder builds up on the cutter. The switch is also better than models where it was rubber-covered, eventually tearing. It is not dual voltage, but an adapter will take care of that, which you might need for other appliances, and a 220v version is available overseas (and from Amazon.de at roughly the same price). It does shave as well, or better, than a blade, but blade users must realize that it takes a few weeks for your beard to adapt and a little time for new cutters and screens to settle in, and that hair recedes into skin after shaving. It comes with a 60-day money backguarantee. Did I mention it&#x27;s cheap?</li>
    <li> OK for travel. Takes a little longer to shave than their better shavers.</li>
    <li> This item is a lower level shave</li>
    <li> Bought it for my Fiance, doesn&#x27;t shave hair off at all. He said I should put 0 stars, but unfortunately it is not an option.</li>
    <li> Works good for my beard.  I use it everyday and a razor blade once a week.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I bought this to replace my existing Remington shaver (same model) whose micro screen started wearing out.  I wanted to just replace the screen, but it was cheaper to just replace the entire razor.  The replacement screens are a rip off!</li>
    <li> Somewhat okay expected much more. Guess it&#x27;s the price. Should have paid a little more money for a better product.</li>
    <li> is effective and excellente product</li>
    <li> Item met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Was a gift and recipient loved it.</li>
    <li> Charge lasts maybe 3 shaves, not very powerful and takes a while to shave unless you only have a 5 oclock shadow. Would make a great travel shaver but not every day home use. The F5 is much better all around</li>
    <li> Considering the price of this shaver, it is just awesome! Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Love it, great for quick shape ups!</li>
    <li> The shave is on par with a Braun I purchased for 3x more money.  Great value.  Comfortable shave.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> IT WAS A SLOW MOTOR. THE EA- 307 WAS MUCH BETTER ,VERY GOOD MOTOR.FOR A THIN FACE IT DID NOT CUT WELL AT ALL. GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. IT SUCKED.</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave my head. It is fast and powerful. It works best with no more than two days growth.  Prior to this purchase I was using a Remington rotary shaver which cost $99.99. I still switch between them occasionally but the foil is cheaper, faster and cuts closer.</li>
    <li> Good back up shaver and quieter than my F-3790.</li>
    <li> good price...excellent shave..</li>
    <li> It can turn a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow into a 3 O&#x27;clock shadow but thats about it.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s barber recommended this shaver for the same clean and close shave he gets when he goes to him. With a job in a 5 star restaurant, my husband needs to keep a well maintained appearance and usually needs to shave every day. This shaver is great and he loves it! We now will be able to save money by not having to go to his barber every week. This shaver is gentle on his sensitive skin. It made a great Father&#x27;s Day gift as well. My husband recommends this Remington shaver for it&#x27;s high quality and low cost.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor. Received it today and used it for the first time. It seems to be of pretty good quality, however the shave is not as smooth as using a regular razor such as Schick or Gilette. I guess I should have expected that upon ordering. It is a good alternative to regular razors because you don&#x27;t need to buy shaving cream or razor refills. It&#x27;s cost effective but you have to settle for a lower quality shave. I use this to shave my head. It leaves my scalp feeling a little razor burned even though my skin does not show any visual signs of razor burn. After applying some after shave it feels better. One point I feel prospective buyers should know is that you need to be careful when cleaning blades with the provided brush. I removed the foil head (there are buttons on each side that release it) and started to brush the hair off the blades. If you are not careful, the piece that holds the blades on will pop right off. It took me a while to get it back on but it doesnt seem to have suffered any damage in the process. Overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this purchase because the price was right and it&#x27;s a pretty good product. When I want a cleaner, smoother shave I will still resort to using a regular razor.</li>
    <li> This is the fifth one I have purchased over the years, I am in my eighties and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Remington shaver, tried othe brands but never was happy with hem</li>
    <li> Although I purchased this as a gift and cannot speak for another person....he really does seem to like this product</li>
    <li> Having used Braun and higher-end Remington foil razors for years, I am very familiar with how close this type of razor should cut.  The F2-3800L barely made a dent on my day-old stubble.  I returned the product to Amazon, and bought a Philips.</li>
    <li> This shaver did not shave at all. I had 3 friends try it to verify it wasn&#x27;t just me. If you went over one area literally about 7 - 10 times it would pull out some hair and cut off the tips of a few hairs. I got a refund for this product and bought a $20 one at walmart that works just fine.</li>
    <li> ZS USUAL A GOOD PRODUCT BY REMINGTON, 86 YRS OLD BEEN USING THEM FROM EARLY NAVY DAYS.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price. I would have been happier with a closer shave tho. But the price is good.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver.  For me, it works as well as a much higher priced shaver.  In fact, better than most.  The only problem I have is that the foil and blade replacement set costs more than a new shaver.  I think this is very wasteful.  It somehow bothers me to throw away a perfectly good shaver when the new one arrives.  I have a couple of battery powered travel shavers.  I plan to use my F-3800 until the foil breaks or the blades get to dull to cut and then use the travel shaver until my new one arrives in the mail.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do a good job at anything. I&#x27;ve tried using this thing to shave numerous times the results have been lackluster.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I bought this for shaving those difficult areas under my chin. Very effective with no razor burn. Small but effective.</li>
    <li> Gets pretty close to the skin, I like this product and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Works great! the battery on this thing lasts forever and i find myself using the sideburn trimmer more than I would have imagined.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. It&#x27;s light weight and a great price. They don&#x27;t last more than a couple years but again, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Misses some hairs, I end up having to shave with a disposable to get the sparse hairs, the trimmer is nice though :)</li>
    <li> Does the job. My hair is coarse, and it works well. Saw it in CVS for about $6.00 less though.</li>
    <li> Razor works OK but trimmer does not function, not worth returning for that minor malfunction.</li>
    <li> I use an electric shaver only occasionally, so this one is perfect for me. At about $23 it&#x27;s basically a throw-away shaver with a 2-year warranty.....Once the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge just toss it.  The performance is excellent......It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> The shave is good but not great. The noise level is high. Comfort is good. Speed is on the slow side for me, I have a gray beard which is very course so it takes a while to get it off. The original price is great, but, the foil only last 6 months as opposed to 18 for a others. The charge light does not go off when charged and does not come on when it needs charging. Won&#x27;t shave when plugged in.</li>
    <li> all ok&lt;br /&gt;works good&lt;br /&gt;trimmer good</li>
    <li> I endured this razor for about a year before switching to a Norelco 6948XL/41, which I found infinitely better. The Remington was so loud I resorted to using it only in a downstairs bathroom to avoid waking the family when shaving in the morning. I truly have an electric hedge clipper that&#x27;s quieter. I could excuse the racket if it cut well but it doesn&#x27;t. For me it did okay only on my cheeks. It was hopeless on my neck and jawbone and I have only a medium thick beard, no bear-like growth.  The trimmer did pretty well. I used it around my ears now and then to delay a trip to the barbershop for a week or two. But even the trimmer disappointed. One time on pushing the slider to pop up the trimmer, the flat cutting head sprung loose from the unit and clattered into the sink. I fussed a long time with the flimsy mechanism, finally getting the tiny spring back in place only to find that the cutting heads were no longer properly aligned, causing it to cut very poorly.  In the end I threw the shaver in the trash rather than even try giving it away.</li>
    <li> I liked this product!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see anything in the specs to indicate that this was a rechargeable.  Based on the price, I mistakenly assumed that it was just a regular corded razor.  I didn&#x27;t want a rechargeable because, let&#x27;s face it, batteries have a limited life.  But, as long as I plug the razor in, in the morning before I get in the shower, I can shave with it (still plugged in) after I get out of the shower and then put it away for the next day.  (If I don&#x27;t plug it in before I get in the shower, then it will run down and stop, even while plugged in.)The shave is about as good as my previous regular (non-rechargeable) Remington.  It will take me a while to get used to the trimmer -- it&#x27;s much more aggressive than my previous razor&#x27;s trimmer -- but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll eventually learn to live with it.</li>
    <li> It gives a decent shave and was a step up from the older Remington I had from 10 years ago, but as usual, the foil screen completely falls apart within the first year. You&#x27;d better be ready, because there are no warning signs! You&#x27;ll know there&#x27;s a big hole in your screen when you&#x27;re halfway done shaving and you suddenly feel the blades cutting you! At least my old one you might notice a little crack or a sting while shaving. This just went from fine to a 4mm hole in the course of one shave. It reminds me of that old Zappa album cover, &amp;#34; Weasels Ripped My Flesh.&amp;#34; Ya know, Remington, I&#x27;d have gladly paid more if you&#x27;d guarantee the screen to last, say, 4 or 5 years.</li>
    <li> Keeps a strong battery charge for several weeks.</li>
    <li> For the price hard to beat.  There are a multitude of razors with more options, technology, and even bells and whistles.  But for the cost this is the best daily shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do great on a three-day (weekend) growth, but I usually use an old fashioned blade at that point anyway.  The charge is excellent, minimum 20 solid shaves for me before I hear that slow drop in power level, though it will last quite a few more shaves after that.  No worries to grab and go for a vacation if you&#x27;ve charged it recently. The trimmer works well for a quick touch up.  Fits well in my hand and moves over the curves and edges very well while not being heavy either.  Also, the foil comes off easy for cleaning by depressing the buttons on either side of the head but the latches help it sit very tight; this makes it feel more solid which I appreciate as I have had other electric razors where the foil head will eventually come loose or even fly off at some point if you don&#x27;t maintain the right pressure at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic and parts feel as though they may eventually wear out, and I don&#x27;t think it will survive a drop to the floor very well, but this is exactly what I was looking for and it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> The first on that was bought wore out rather quick, we will see if this one holds up</li>
    <li> My hair started falling out on top and I didn&#x27;t relish the idea of looking like Rob Reiner so I started shaving my head. Some razors specify that it is not for use on the head, but this works just fine on mine. It is also the cheapest one for the job. I&#x27;m buying this to replace one just like it that I wore out, so that should tell you that I thought it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> Remington is the Timex of electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;Not fancy but affordable and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement screens and cutters about $16.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
    <li> This was a gift for some one in their 90&#x27;s who stills likes to shave himself but could not handle the more complicated shavers out there. This one works great for him, and for the price I do not have worry if it breaks ...just get a new one.</li>
    <li> I have and had several foil shavers from Remington; bought first one in 1990.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is very thick and requires a rotatory head first and than the foil head.&lt;br /&gt;Remington, though very good and with several foil shavers options, never had any one less noisier.&lt;br /&gt;This model in particular is very efficient but noisier than the formers foil shavers I had before</li>
    <li> This shave is awesome! I have very coarse hair and the clippers on this thing shear right through it with no problem, razor is excellent too I&#x27;ve been using it for several months everyday and it&#x27;s just as sharp as when I bought it. Going to buy another before they get discontinued or sold out. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This item replaced my old razor I had for more than ten years, (same model). You will not go wrong for the price and it may not be for everyone but I love it. Works very well for me and hope it will last another ten years.</li>
    <li> Blades get dull incredibly quickly.  Great form factor and battery life, but cheap blades that don&#x27;t have much longevity.</li>
    <li> This razor was purchased for my elderly father-in-law because he should no longer be using a safety razor. He was able to do a pretty good job with it. However, when he declined, and I needed to do the shaving for him, this went into the trash. It took forever to get the whiskers off and was leaving long hairs that required the accessory shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give this thing credit because he was able to get an ok shave with it, but when I needed to use it, it got a thumbs down. Although the price is great, this razor makes shaving more difficult than it needs to be. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I tried an imitation of this razor and it only lasted 3 months. Remington is good quality. My last one lasted 2 years. This razor like all foil razors, works best on short stubble.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T know how there is such a price range from $14 to $300 for an electric shaver.  I do all the work moving it all over my face,  I don&#x27;t need it to start my coffee pot or boil my eggs, play music, or read to me,  just cut my beard.</li>
    <li> Remington will never be better than braun! This can&#x27;t operate while it&#x27;s charging.......</li>
    <li> I now have two of these. Forgot and left the other in Florida. I use the electric for area around my mouth and chin and Adam&#x27;s apple. Rest is done with a wet blade. The Remington is perfect for the job and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> This is a good close shaving razor. I was VERY disappointed I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement foil for my old Remington razor so I was forced to buy another new one.</li>
    <li> I got the Remington F2-3800L Electric Shaver after Christmas.  I got it mainly for the  price (around $20.00) and I was very pleased with the product, it was an attractive shaver with user friendly on/off buttons &amp; a good sideburn trimmer.  It shaves relatively close (for an electric shaver), as long as you use an alcohol based cleanser to make the hairs stand up, you should be good.  The item is easy to clean, with the enclosed small brush and the rotating blades come off easily for a quick cleaning.  Overall, I really like this shaver and I would buy another one as soon as this one wears out.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Been using and repurchasing this razor for over a decade. I&#x27;ve even tried more expensive razors, but keep coming back to this one. Price is incredible, and it gives a great shave. Even if there is a stubble or two remaining, I use the clipper on the back to remove the stubble. Blades and foil last a long time. Wish it had a low battery indicator, but can&#x27;t complain for the price. I normally get through the 5-day work week with one charge.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave well. don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> This product was useless.  I just wanted a shaver to use on my legs for light hair and it did not work at all.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Dont use the fancy Remingtons just more money for nothing.  Best thing to do is buy a base model like this and change every 6-8 months if you shave regularly. Best price around and they have them in stock.  Stay away from triple headers or moving heads.</li>
    <li> Not the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This is my daily shaver.  Maybe if I paid an additional 50 to 100 bucks I would get a more refined shave however I find this does the job perfectly well and don&#x27;t feel the need to spend that much.</li>
    <li> Great transaction. Just as promised. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Horrible razor but I guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> A very fair seller, nice product  would recommend!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. This product doesn&#x27;t do anything except for turn of and off and make noise. Doesn&#x27;t shave or trim facial hair.</li>
    <li> This shaver gets the job done as well as $100+ shavers I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  It works well and quickly for daily shaves. It won&#x27;t cut a growth of soft whiskers which bend in its path, however. But then few electrics will.  Cut them with a blade.</li>
    <li> works so far, not bad.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have found for a woman&#x27;s under arms. Other brands that I have tried have cut me.</li>
    <li> Good razor , screen seems a little soft but should last 6-8 months</li>
    <li> ordered not knowing exactly what would receive.  shipping and packing beyond excellent, and received very promptly.  the shaver/clipper is a complete winner.  very good close, and with distant stubble..  will try to obtain more for X-mas gifts..  a very good product, delivered moe quickly that I thought possible,  exceptionally well packed with amazon prime, and gave a very impressive shave on its first use..</li>
    <li> It actually does a pretty good job for a $20 shaver. It seems well made for the price, with a powerful motor,  a great trimmer and it feels solid. It&#x27;s a little noisy, with no counter-vibration action (unlike a no-name shaver from China I owned a few years back) and like most foil shavers, tends to get annoyingly gummed up. The biggest negative, though is the short lived foil/cutter that costs 80% of the cost of a new shaver. This is particularly depressing, since the cutter will probably outlast not just the foil, but the rest of the shaver. If Remington made the foil available alone for a reasonable price, I could recommend it more enthusiastically. I&#x27;ll live with it for now, but since I tend to start with a beard trimmer, then this shaver, then touch up what it missed with a disposable, I could probably get by with a $10 special from the dollar store, and the foils on those last a lot longer. FOLLOWUP: The trimmer fell apart in my hands shortly after I wrote this. The aftermarket foil did last longer than Remington&#x27;s; it might have been thicker. But when it failed I grabbed a 10 year old travel shaver (Shave Man) out of the closet and it did a better job than the Remington ever had. I won&#x27;t consider another Remington until their quality improves and reasonably priced parts are more easily available; a few spare screens should be included in the original purchase.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  Quality razor at a very reasonable price.  Remington improved protective cover which no longer falls off.  These units cost about the same as replacement components (screen, cutters).  When the screen wears out I just order a new razor.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this rayzor. His only complaint is for the price of buying new blades you can buy a whole new rayzor.&lt;br /&gt;He uses the flip out trimmer as much as the rayzor to trim other area, side burns. It stays charged a long time my husband travels he leaves one in his suitcase and one at home.</li>
    <li> I have found that the features on more expensive shavers do not improve their performance or reliability, particularly in proportion to their increased price.</li>
    <li> Worst shaver I have ever tried - does nothing but pull at my facial hair, yup, it was cheap but should not be junk, but it is. Purchase a Braun Series 3-340s Wet &amp; Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver well worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Nice inexpensive electric shaver</li>
    <li> I love these shavers.  Cannot be beat for the money.  I never order replacement blades, a new shaver costs the same, so I just order it instead.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, good value.</li>
    <li> It does not give a clean shave as advertise, I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> It is not work as I expected It just work with little beard</li>
    <li> wow this works perfect and if you miss or hair grows to long just use the trimer , its sick thx amazon , guys buy this one</li>
    <li> Good value for low Amazon price (got for less than $ 20). Shaves well, close shave with good battery life and comfortable to handle.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Remington foil shavers better than rotary shavers. They give a closer shave for my beard. The downside is the foil screens are fragile and don&#x27;t last long. Mine got holes in the screens after 2 months. The razor has a 2 yr. warranty but screens and cutters are not covered. Replacement screen (and cutter) costs around $ 16 from Amazon. That is why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars. I am careful with the razors and hold them at 90 degrees to facial skin surface as recommended by Remington. Still, the screens never last long. Recommended replacement is at 6 months.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teen son as a beginner shaver after his battery powered travel shaver. He likes the shave it gives and especially likes te flip up trimmer. Good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY  GLAD I BOUGHT IT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good value, perhaps not for everyday use but as a touch-up. The pop-up trimmer works surprisingly well too</li>
    <li> Was noisy and did not give close shave. If that is new technology then they need to go back to drawing broad.  Returned for refund</li>
    <li> Christmas present for a grandson.  He was happy to receive it.  It seems to work well, I;ve not heard anything different.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Worked OK on my face, but not so much on my head.</li>
    <li> Although the product details lists this razor as corded/cordless...it is not. This is a cordless only razor. Very disappointed with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Since this is an electric shaver, it should come as no surprise to you that it won&#x27;t quite give you the smooth shave that a real blade will. That being said, it does a pretty good job nonetheless, and the flip-out trimmer is a definite boon as well. Unlike lesser models that might get choked up over a couple days&#x27; growth, this bad boy can eat right through the scraggle with the trimmer, and then smooth out whatever is left using the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing I could really say is that it can have some difficulty cleaning up hair on the neck due to the softness of the skin there, but with a little effort, it&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. It is a light weight, works well, and is very compact. One charge can last almost a whole week.</li>
    <li> Does not shave close. I thought this would be an ohm razor since battery replacement in electric razors is overpriced. Just throw this out when it needs new batteries. Problem is the shave is just ok. I have had Remington&#x27;s in the past and I do not remember them shaving as bad as this. I did come from a Norelco but I would expect a closer shave than this provides.</li>
    <li> You cannot possibly get better bang for your buck.  This is a great electric shaver and it&#x27;s astonishingly low priced.</li>
    <li> It is a decent razor for the price, but it still has a cheap feel to it. It doesn&#x27;t provide a very close shave nor does it want to chop hair that has any length to it at all.</li>
    <li> it does an ok job, but takes a long time.  meh what do you expect for 20$.  the hairs dont seem to get guided into the holes well, especially longer hairs, so you tend to miss the longer hairs...but for a quickie it works</li>
    <li> Ignore my lengthy review!  This razor has betrayed the Remington name and is nothing less than trash!  Ignore Following:  With this superb bargain priced shaver that will meet the most demanding standards of anyone, Remington&#x27;s design team has done it once again.  This particular model is breathtaking in both functionality and execution.  Fitting in the hand like the proverbial glove, the Remington F2-3800L shaver looks as good as it fits.  This one will definitely take pride of place in your bath and is light to have the mobility required when travelling.  The exceptional rechargeable battery has a brightly luminous green signal light that announces loudly it is in recharge mode and provides the warning one needs that the device is plugged in to electricity.  Remington&#x27;s Flexing Foil Technology is put to its most perfect use as integrated into the shaver when it goes into action.  A gently comfortable shaving experience results in a stunningly close shave.  Say goodbye to irritated skin and razor rash when the baby&#x27;s kiss like assault on your whiskers goes all-out upon initialization of the conveniently located power switch.  You will be amazed!  This shaver does a better and less painful job than similar devices costing 8 times the price of what is fast becoming a star attraction to Remington&#x27;s classic line-up.  Perfect as a gift for any man or as a very special present to oneself, The F2-3800L cleans-up easily and stores simply.  The cord is extra long and makes charging the exquisite battery easy in the most trying conditions one might possibly encounter.  A small plastic tie is included so the cord can be secured compactly with little to no effort. However, the real standout feature of this shaver is the Remington name itself.  Since the beginning of the electric shave, Remington has blazed new trails across the shaving scene and is the most highly respected name in razors.  No one who has ever owned a Remington has ever turned to another brand once they have allowed themselves to be embraced in that utterly distinctive and uniquely wondrous Remington experience.  With the F2-3800L model, Remington has incorporated the most modern technological advances with the excellence of the Remington Classics.  With superb Functionality, Durability, and Attractiveness, Remington has produced the finest shaver on the market today at a price that truly astounds.  Remington stands for All American quality, trust and competence as few other manufacturers can claim.  The integrity and honesty of the company is without question as demonstrated by the 2 year warranty that comes as a standard with this outstanding product.  Remington obviously believes in this shaver and after your first utilization of it you will as well.  If you have been pleased with electrically powered shavers in the past, it will be difficult for you to come close to grasping the intensity of your initial feelings when the F2-3800L finishes working on your face.  So, do what I did and millions of others are doing every single day: Add the Remington Experience to your daily hygiene routine.  You will never go back to any other brand shaver.  I certainly won&#x27;t!  The shockingly inexpensive Remington F2-3800L With Flexing Foil Technology is the ultimate shaver and simply can not be surpassed in my book.</li>
    <li> A splendid value--quite satisfactory and reasonable.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT MET ALL I EXPECTED....I AM QUITE PLEASED..LOOKING AT BUYING THREE MORE ...AS GIFTS..</li>
    <li> Does not really clear my beard completely, my good old philips did a much better job, and that stuff was 8 yrs old.</li>
    <li> If you are an adult with a shave every day beard, this razor is in my personal opinion is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two because I had satisfying results with a similar Remington shavers that were no longer available. The razor is not sharp and does not cleanly cut hairs. Propensity is to press harder and stretch skin to get closer result. Definitely leaves razor burn. I would only recommend this razor for a young man just starting to shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price, would recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> Husband loves it. Great price, close shave, fast charge.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the shaver while it worked.  For the price it gave a decent shave and the charge lasted for about 5 - 7 shaves.  Unfortunately it just stopped charging after 6 months.  It was not dropped or damaged.  One day it just stopped charging and the charge light would not come on.  I really cannot recommend this particular model although I am still a fan of the Remington razors.</li>
    <li> I have used these Remington shavers for many years, am happy with their performance and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get a close shave</li>
    <li> It is good razor for the price. I&#x27;m please witth it. It is easy to clean and the size if great.</li>
    <li> Not the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had. The main blades have a lot of trouble catching hair. The trimming arm works really well though, I even use it before shaving 2 weeks of growth. But even though it has dual blades it will never give you a close shave. I&#x27;m considering normal razors again...</li>
    <li> This shaver is a good value.  It gives a reasonably close shave.  It charges fast but only lasts 3-4 shaves.  Easy to clean.  Small size makes it good for travel.</li>
    <li> Not effective on thick facial hair</li>
    <li> First month or so the shaver was great - gave me about as good a shave as I have ever had, especially for the price.  Then a place on the screen bulged out for some reason and then the unit failed to hold a charge for more than a couple of shaves.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I USE IT FOR EMERGENCIES AND AN OCCASIONAL TRIM</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this shaver because the top blade does not provide a close shave. However, the blade that folds out is very good and provides a close shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s stable,confortable and cheap, It&#x27;s very worth.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this so much he got an extra so when this one dies he has a new one right away.</li>
    <li> Worst shaver I ever purchased!! You have to stretch your skin greatly, press down hard, and go over the same area several times and still it does not give a decent close shave. No wonder Amazon has discounted this and I found it new discounted at a major chain pharmacy for $10.99. It&#x27;s not even worth $10.99. In order to get a halfway decent shave you need to first use the trimmer, which I would only have had to use with other shavers for tough longer beard situations and go over the same area at least 6 times over the same area. Pls. do yourself a favor, buy a decent shaver... this unit is JUNK!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not worthy to be associated with what was a respectable name brand &amp;#34;REMINGTON&amp;#34; nor the quality you would expect.</li>
    <li> I am VERY disappointed - I expected a lot more from Remington.  I have other Remington shavers and this is the first time that I bought one that does NOT work.  If trying to use, you have to push the foil HARD against your face to trim off a portion of facial hair but it STILL leaves about 1 mm of hair length. I am not sure if this shaver was designed to just trim or to actually shave.  Definitely NOT RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product for a full refund.</li>
    <li> What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The unit is well suited for travel use. The shaver and wall charger are small and light enough to fit inside a toiletries pouch without taking up a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The unit is exceptionally easy to take apart and clean. Disassembly for cleaning consists merely of pressing two spring-loaded buttons on each side to pop off the hair pocket, removing the screen from the hair pocket by pushing in two tabs inside the housing, and then removing the cutters by rotating them 90°. With little practice, one can perform the disassembly in under five seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The battery seems to last quite a while between recharges. The manual indicates that each full charge is good for 40 minutes of continuous use; I shave about two minutes per day, and have gone a full month between charges. That&#x27;s 60 minutes per charge, for now. Perhaps that&#x27;s because the unit is still fairly new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. A replacement foil and cutter set (SP-62) seems fairly reasonably priced. Amazon currently sells it for $16, and I&#x27;ve seen it at local retail stores for under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you&#x27;re travelling and intend to bring this unit overseas, think again. The provided charger only operates on 120 VAC @ 60 Hz. It would be nice if Remington had included a multi-voltage charger (100-240 VAC, 50/60 Hz), but that might have driven the price up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The unit doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as other more costly electric shavers. Not really an issue if you shave everyday. My previous shaver was a Remington MS-280, and the difference in the closeness of the shaves is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO-TIP: When using the pop-up trimmer, remove the hair pocket and cutters. This eliminates unecessary wear on the screen and cutters, and reduces battery drain since the cutters aren&#x27;t being driven.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver! Gets a very close shave. It is a little on the loud side, but still a great shaver for the price! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and charged it the first time as per the instructions it stayed charged for over three weeks and still it didnt need to be charged yed and its powerful and gives a nice close shave for the price you cant beat this shaver</li>
    <li> Apparently my hubby likes this shaver as it is identical to the one he wore out.  So I&#x27;d have to give it a good rating.  And I&#x27;m guessing he will buy the same when this ones hits the trash can.</li>
    <li> come good condition, but don&#x27;t working</li>
    <li> not as close shave as i wanted.</li>
    <li> Well received:  It shaves A-ok!  However I do not shave every day and at 3 days, it will not cut off my whiskers very good.  I will have to run the razor 15-20 times over every area of my face.  My old razor will cut off the hair within 3-5 passes on my face.  I have to use this razor on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the basic foil razor. I must admit, it hurt against my face for a few days to &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; but afterwards it otherwise works well and holds a decent charge. The only drawback is that it takes longer to shave if some hairs are larger than 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;I can see myself upgrading in a year or so to a real coil one that doesn&#x27;t take so many passes.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny, Cheaper than the replacement blade &amp; foil.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Light, Powerful, Inexpensive</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor. I have coarse hair and I use this in between shavings. Its a close shave and well worth the money. Best razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Good, simple razor.  Good value.</li>
    <li> ive only used it a couple times, but it does a pretty good job</li>
    <li> Cheaply built. Screens do a poor job of shaving.</li>
    <li> Chintzy as all getout.  Cuts nothing and I mean nothing. The beard trimmer is actually in an upside down location making it impossible to trim neatly. I put this in the yard sale for a buck. Let the buyer be smarter than me</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s fine.  Seems like the batteries don&#x27;t hold a charge as long as my previous ones.  This is the 3rd one of this model I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Works great. I shave my entire head. Like all electric razors, it takes a few days for my hair to adjust to a new razor.  After that, very good.</li>
    <li> got this for my husband so far he really likes it</li>
    <li> i like it charges fast  good shaver</li>
    <li> works with my beard but the reality is everyone is different.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington shavers for a long time - since back in the day when the Victor Kiam &amp;#34;I liked the shaver so much bought the comapny&amp;#34;  commercials were on TV.  While there are fancier and more expensive shavers out there, I chose to stick with what worked for me.  Given how different the shapes, contours, skin sensitivities, etc. on faces are from person to person, I have no idea how to select a &amp;#34;best shaver&amp;#34; other than to try a few brands to find what works for you.  However, in terms of performance and reliability, I&#x27;d say Remmington should certainly be on your list of brands to try.</li>
    <li> Shaver fell apart when I cleaned the heads.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t cut for sh@t</li>
    <li> Gotta push very hard to shave, too useless.</li>
    <li> I am not someone with a thick growth, just average.  I love the shape of this razor when I hold it, seems very well designed.  I think the heads do a great job, especially above my lip which is a tough area and where the 3-head razors always gave me trouble.</li>
    <li> I have had many razors over the years. I have mainly used the rotary type ones, but this time I wanted to try this foil type. I&#x27;ve only had it about a month, but it seems to work really well. I find it easier to shave around my chin and upper lip area with the shape of this razor head than the rotary heads.</li>
