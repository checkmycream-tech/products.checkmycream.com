    <li> So relaxing I love this!!</li>
    <li> OMG I love this stuff! I work 2 jobs and am on my feet a LOT, so when I can come home and soak my feet after being on them for 18hrs, I&#x27;m having a really good day. The foot soak is so relaxing, and the peppermint helps relax my mind as well.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and reasonably priced if you buy at the Big Box store for about one third the price here. I quite like it. It smells like peppermint to me and makes my feet feel better at the same time. I plan on trying other Dr. Teal foot soaks as well.</li>

    <li> I purchased my first bag at a local retail store and used it in the bath, Ladies I can not use bubble bath so this is very different. Plan on a long soak in the tub the aroma and the way your skin and body feels after a soak with this product will make you a believer, you will be hooked. This is not just for the ladies or a foot soak you can use it in the bath as well.Ok guys don&#x27;t be shy you know you like to be pampered just as much as us gals do.</li>

    <li> This really helps to relax you and you can feel it working pretty fast.  Also helps kill odors and soften feet.</li>
    <li> This really wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, and the scent is very very strong. Could be this is my first time buying something like this but it caught me off guard. Seems like a good product overall and great price though.</li>
    <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s foot scrub is excellent. I use it regularly to ease foot pain from being on my feet.</li>
    <li> I just love Dr.Teals salts. They leave my feet feeling soft and refreshed. I try and soak my feet about once a week. It feels really great with Dr. Teals. The smell is very refreshing also, my fav is peppermint.</li>
    <li> I wake up late at night unable to sleep and pour a bucket of warm water and use this I it.  And within about 10 minutes, I am ready for buddy-bye.  Nice scent.</li>
    <li> i used this with my foot bath and omg soft hevanly clouds for my footies! i love my feet so much more now!</li>
    <li> I love it. I should buy more. I think I will.</li>
    <li> Searched around in all the beauty stores for something like this.  Prices were starting at $25.  I reward my tred feet with a soak that makes they soft again.</li>
    <li> Always soothing and relaxing.</li>
    <li> makes my feet feel so refreashed</li>
    <li> They put some sort of strange fragrance in this and it smelled awful.  I love peppermint, but this had other stuff in it too and was not pleasant.</li>
    <li> So soothing.  Great for my arthritis feet!</li>
    <li> This product is great! Smells great and is a nice touch to add to an at-home pedicure! It shipped fast and I would recommend it</li>
    <li> This works a lot better than the listerine/apple cider vinegar trick. Smells great! I work full time at a job where I can&#x27;t sit down. This helps.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good and is so relaxing in a foot bath</li>
    <li> This soak is great for tired and sore feel.  Feels nice after long day on my feet or working out.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I am famous for taking aleve after working 8 to 12 hour shifts on my feet BUT after soaking in this my feet felt better immediately, I was ache FREE!! it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful item that has a great smell to it. It makes my skin so soft it feels new.  That being said I give less that a star to the price of the item. After purchasing this item on Amazon my husband purchased  it for me at the local Wal-Mart without realizing I had bought it through Amazon. I paid over 12 dollars for this item and he purchased for 3.50 at the Wal-Mart up the street. That is over 8 dollar difference which is highway robbery. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves. I have noticed this with a lot of items now and am more careful about just purchasing blindly from them.</li>
    <li> Super relaxing!!! Must have!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a family member and she loves this product. She soaks in it and it helps with minor aches and pains.</li>
    <li> very soothing and relaxing the scent fills the room and makes for a very relaxing soak.  Dead skin slides ride off.  Gross I know but that&#x27;s what you want :)</li>
    <li> Great Product -Will order again!</li>
    <li> Very soothing!!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is not your mother&#x27;s Epsom Salts. It smells great and very soothing. I would encourage anyone to try this product.</li>
    <li> I like the product. Its so soothing to be able to soak your tired feet with a product like this. Ive added it to my pedicure  regimen. I would buy again in bulk if given the opp for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and price. I highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Very soothing.  My husband and I both use it and love the way our feet feel afterwards.  The scent relaxes your whole body too as you breathe in.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a new product to try so i came across this product.I have tired achy feet and on my feet hrs and this product works very well.Im very pleased with the scents available its amazing.I will defiently by more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> It does what it says...........great product!</li>
    <li> I have always used epsom salts for soaking my feet, but the peppermint was a nice new touch.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> It smells great! Envigorating! Feel so nice to soak my feet in this especially since im on my feet all day!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, its refreshing but not overpowering, like sweet peppermint tea. I use this product with a conair foot bath. [[ASIN:B004D22N2E Conair True Massaging Foot Bath With Bubbles and Heat, White]] For bad calluses I add Dr Teals, plus baking soda to very warm water and soak feet for 20 minutes. Then I use this pumice stone, wet [[ASIN:B000HZ9L8K Earth Therapeutics Natural Sierra Pumice Stone]] to remove the dead skin. Next, I pat my feet dry and coat them with petroleum jelly and put on socks. It takes about an hour for jelly to absorb into my skin and voila! My dry, cracked, and callused feet are vastly improved.</li>
    <li> Unlike some reviewers, I did not find the peppermint epsom salts overpowering; however, I only used about one-half cup in a foot soaking tub.  Although I have used epsom salts for decades, this is my first experience using Dr. Teal&#x27;s and I would recommend them and I most certainly will purchase The Dr. Teal&#x27;s variety of soaking solutions again.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this foot soak. It is refreshing after a long day of running around in the summer heat and the scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering - just right.</li>
    <li> Did ok. Wasn&#x27;t very powerful relief</li>
</ol>
