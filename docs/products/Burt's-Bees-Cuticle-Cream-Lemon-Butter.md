      <li>I love the lemon scent.</li>
      <li>I have a better cuticle pen with Avocado and Almond oils that I use that leaves them</li>
      <li>do, however, love the lemony scent</li>
      <li>The lemony scent is refreshing without being overwhelming</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s addictive to keep reapplying because it smells and feels so great, but the novelty will wear off.</li>
      <li>the scent is amazing, and my nails and cuticles are so much healthier now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s lemony scent is not too strong, smells just right!</li>
      <li>The cream has an enjoyable light lemon smell and soaks in pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a lovely lemon smell and really softens and moisturizes my cuticles, which are prone to splitting and cracking!</li>

      <li>Or, I smooth it on my hands right before bed, which gets rid of chapping.   </li>
      <li>The tin is also great; it closes tightly so you can stow it in a bag.</li>
      <li>Wow, I love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Our family has used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for many years with complete satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Also, a bit overpriced for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Only ok.  </li>
      <li>this continues to be a favorite product, no different with this one!</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this cuticle cream out for myself based on the wonderful reviews but sad to say it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The effect of this cuticle cream took about a week, but it was been really positive and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I expected MAGIC.</li>
      <li>If too much is applied it does get to feeling &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; until the cream is soaked in by your cuticles.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After using this cuticle cream for about two weeks, my nails are already stronger &amp; looking so much</li>
      <li>&amp; it seems like it will last me a great while, even though it&#x27;s a small container.</li>
      <li>Will also smear on anything you pick up if you are not careful right after use.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and it works very well to moisturize my extra dry cuticles.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and use it year round.</li>
      <li>I also love to paint my nails and dry my fingers out frequently with acetone, so my cuticles definitely needed some help.</li>
      <li>&amp; having acrylic prior for three months straight didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
      <li>I always keep it with me and apply at least once a day, usually more.</li>
      <li>I was expecting something called &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; to be soft and creamy, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>Within a few minutes my cuticles are softened and easy to push back &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I live in the Midwest and spend a lot of time outside.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey for such a little container but very worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also smells AMAZING, goes on thick and feels soft and slightly greasy.</li>
      <li>All natural ingredients is a big bonus.  </li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t like about it is it goes down too fast for the price.  </li>
      <li>nails naturally grow quickly, but they&#x27;ve always grown out so weak.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> smells great and works quickly to smooth and soothe cuticles that are hardened and/or thickened.  I would like a much larger package tho.  this is excellent to carry in my purse for when you are out and about.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and use it year round. It has a lovely lemon smell and really softens and moisturizes my cuticles, which are prone to splitting and cracking!</li>
    <li> Does what it claims, and beautifully. I&#x27;m a California girl, relocated to the harsh wintery locale of Chicago, and my hands have suffered badly from the dry and the cold. This stuff has helped from the moment I put it on.</li>
    <li> This is a winter must-have. The balm is thick and moisturizing. It keeps nails from cracking and cuticles from getting ragged. The lemon oil makes it smell absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s a little sticky, since it&#x27;s so thick, but I find that this is not a problem if you just dab a little on your nails and work it in. Or, I smooth it on my hands right before bed, which gets rid of chapping.   The tin is also great; it closes tightly so you can stow it in a bag.</li>
    <li> The skin around my nails always gets dried, cracked and cut, especially during the dry winter months. I had been using Neosporin type ointments to help heal the cuts. That&#x27;s until I found this stuff. I put it on at night and it helps heal the damages caused during the day. It&#x27;s a little greasy, but this is the only stuff that not only heals but also moisturizes. Lotion just stings on nicks but this stuff doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s pricey for such a little container but very worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the lemon scent. This product works great to heal dry damaged cuticles. A must have for winter. A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> Like all Burt&#x27;s Bees products, it&#x27;s great . . . love the lemon scent. Keep it on my desk and use it several times a day.</li>
    <li> I love this! I carry it everywhere and just continue to massage into my cuticles. It smells lovely too!</li>
    <li> Within a few minutes my cuticles are softened and easy to push back &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;This also works very good for cracked fingertips during the winter,&lt;br /&gt;and softens knuckles, elbows.The cream has an enjoyable light lemon smell and soaks in pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our family has used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for many years with complete satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;This cuticle cream is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains Sweet almond oil ~ beeswax ~ lemon oil ~ tocopheryl acetate ~ tocopherol (vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;coca butter ~ candelilla wax ~ rosemary extract ~ beta carotene.</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love this product. I keep this cuticle cream on my desk at work and apply it two to four times a day. Using it regularly has dramatically improved the look and health of the skin surrounding my cuticles! I live in the Midwest and spend a lot of time outside. I also love to paint my nails and dry my fingers out frequently with acetone, so my cuticles definitely needed some help. The effect of this cuticle cream took about a week, but it was been really positive and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells AMAZING, goes on thick and feels soft and slightly greasy. Your nail bed will absorb the cream in 5 to 10 minutes. It&#x27;s addictive to keep reapplying because it smells and feels so great, but the novelty will wear off. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this! the scent is amazing, and my nails and cuticles are so much healthier now.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it works very well to moisturize my extra dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My cuticles get really dry and painful in the winter but this helps a lot. I always keep it with me and apply at least once a day, usually more. My manicures seem to be lasting longer since I started using this too. Aside from that it smells great! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> love it, especially in the cold winter months.</li>
    <li> Only ok.  I expected MAGIC.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this cuticle cream out for myself based on the wonderful reviews but sad to say it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I like my nails to look shiny but rubbing this on my nails and cuticles makes them look dull.  I have a better cuticle pen with Avocado and Almond oils that I use that leaves them shinier.&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, love the lemony scent but that&#x27;s about it. Also, a bit overpriced for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I ordered this &amp; got it two days later!&lt;br /&gt;Which was perfect because I wanted to start treating my nails with it as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails naturally grow quickly, but they&#x27;ve always grown out so weak. &amp; having acrylic prior for three months straight didn&#x27;t help at all. After using this cuticle cream for about two weeks, my nails are already stronger &amp; looking so much healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lemony scent is not too strong, smells just right! If too much is applied it does get to feeling &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; until the cream is soaked in by your cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase! &amp; it seems like it will last me a great while, even though it&#x27;s a small container.</li>
    <li> What I don&#x27;t like about it is it goes down too fast for the price.  Here in out dry climate, I&#x27;m constantly using it.  Will also smear on anything you pick up if you are not careful right after use.</li>
    <li> After years of waiting tables and constantly washing my hands I found my cuticles were dry and cracked.  I love this cuticle balm! After one week of use my cuticles are healing.  They are softer, more supple, and look amazing!  The lemony scent is refreshing without being overwhelming and it&#x27;s not greasy.  All natural ingredients is a big bonus.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells really nice.</li>
    <li> The name of the product is misleading. I was expecting something called &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; to be soft and creamy, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s hard and oily, like an ointment. I find it hard to apply. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> this continues to be a favorite product, no different with this one!</li>
