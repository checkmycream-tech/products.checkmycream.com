      <li>/&gt;Thank you for making a product that both myself and my husband can enjoy.</li>
      <li>a cheap ................</li>
      <li>Nice gift set fast shipping</li>
      <li>Luckily my dad is easy going and said just forget about it</li>
      <li>I love this warm, unique and exotic fragrance, it is great for casual wear or to the office.</li>
      <li>Also came in a nice bucket to put on a young man&#x27;s dresser.</li>
      <li>It has a somewhat pleasant scent, but nothing like I expected.</li>
      <li>I do a lot of face-to-face customer interaction and this scent is great because it is light and not overpowering with that musky smell so common in men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
      <li>Products were intriguing.  </li>
      <li>He is young and I am sure will use them all pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>purchased some of these sets for gifts and even though they are inexpensive, they are visually impressive in the little wooden bucket.</li>
      <li>My dad love this gift set and it was a big hit.</li>
      <li>I will pay the Thirty bucks at the mall from now on for the large bottle.  </li>
      <li>he likes the smell as much as I do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>bought it for my 18 y.o. son and he really likes it too.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve realized this whole thing had lasted 11months.</li>
      <li>counter.this smells really nice,cant keep my hands off him.</li>
      <li>I works very well with my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for this item, I brought it for my fiancee for our Anniversary</li>
      <li>I am very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>My father has tried looking for this at several locations and could never find it available.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this fragrance for over ten years, and this is not the original Cuba Gold Fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Definitely well worth it!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is great, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
      <li>I normally wear Opium</li>
      <li>They take really long for a delivery.i got all the products that I order after this order before this one I got all my gifts quick except this one it took almost two weeks</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been hesitant to try anything new.  </li>
      <li>Amazon did give me a refund, but, my gift is spoiled; I mean, how do you give a present to an acquaintance with a piece of the all-enclosing-plastic-wrap-missing, right at the top?  </li>
      <li>this stuff really surprised me.  </li>
      <li>I am prone to getting migraines from overly &#x27;loud&#x27; fragrances, whether they be colognes for men or for women.  </li>
      <li>whenever he&#x27;s near me</li>
      <li>I am a substitute teacher and at a high school I saw several of the young men smelling and passing around what looked a cigar.  </li>
      <li>but when I received it I was surprised to see a real wooden bucket with all the included sprays and after shave held in place with a plastic tray.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didnt give it more stars is because one of the bottles were broken at the bottom when it got to him.</li>

    <li> Got this for my husband as a present. This is one of his favorite colones and he totally loved it. I was satisfied with its arrival time and its presentation.</li>
    <li> Great item at a great price. If you like this cologne you will like this gift set. The &amp;#34;bucket&amp;#34; makes for a nice carry-all for the colognes and keeps them from rolling all over the counters.</li>
    <li> great product,met all expectations</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband. It has a somewhat pleasant scent, but nothing like I expected. One of the spray bottles did not work.</li>
    <li> My husband enjoyed this gift!!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves cuba everything! The bucket that comes with it was a nice touch to his bathroom counter.this smells really nice,cant keep my hands off him.</li>
    <li> Got this years ago in Puerto Rico. I broke necks in college because women loved the smell and it was a smell not many people is using today. Love it, Recommend to try it!</li>
    <li> They take really long for a delivery.i got all the products that I order after this order before this one I got all my gifts quick except this one it took almost two weeks</li>
    <li> Thanks this set was great !</li>
    <li> This gift was ok, but wat I didn&#x27;t like is that the small skinny bottle was broken when my boyfriend open it there was glass all over and perfume all over. I think Amazon should check there products before shipping it</li>
    <li> My father has tried looking for this at several locations and could never find it available. Luckily I found it on here and was able to order it for him. The product makes a great gift, and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just a little satisfied, the base came departure!!</li>
    <li> For the price it is not worth it - smaller product than what one would expect for the price.  The scent is good.</li>
    <li> My dad love this gift set and it was a big hit. The samples were good size and good varitey.</li>
    <li> Brought this cologne for my man,and it smells so good,makes me wanna💏whenever he&#x27;s near me</li>
    <li> Products were intriguing.  But, packaging was AWFUL.  Entire top of the plastic wrap was missing!!!!!  (And no, it was NOT &amp;#34;lost in the packaging.&amp;#34;  It was nowhere to be found!  I was hoping I could find it and tape it together, but, no.)  Amazon did give me a refund, but, my gift is spoiled; I mean, how do you give a present to an acquaintance with a piece of the all-enclosing-plastic-wrap-missing, right at the top?  (Guessing responses:  &amp;#34;Well, she just got this out of the closet and gifted it to me&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;What a cheap ................Don&#x27;t I mean anything to her?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> is a good perfume and I really liked the people that he loved Give the gift I recommend it to my family and friends</li>
    <li> Hubby is very happy!!! I bought this last yr around Father&#x27;s Day 2nd time around I bought this again &amp; it amazes with my husband working helping raising our kids non stop active he always smells great! &amp; I&#x27;ve realized this whole thing had lasted 11months. Definitely well worth it!</li>
    <li> this item was exactly what I wanted to give my hubby for Christmas, unfortunately when it arrived the package was torn completely, and one of the items was leaking. could have been careless people transporting.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for this item, I brought it for my fiancee for our Anniversary and HE LOVED IT!!! AMAZON IS AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I have the say the basket of Cuba was a big HIT! my husband loved it.and most of all it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Beautiful classic scent, smells great on my man! Wooden bucket adds extra pizzazz to the gift.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of everything but I thought it was coming in a bucket and it was also late by 10 days</li>
    <li> this is a great cologne if you looking for a cheaper price cologne also it stays on for a long time on your clothes.</li>
    <li> It smells good and the bucket was nice but it was poorly packaged and arrived with the travel bottle broken and leaking all over everything.</li>
    <li> I am prone to getting migraines from overly &#x27;loud&#x27; fragrances, whether they be colognes for men or for women.  Because of this our choices of colognes have been limited to very few and I&#x27;ve been hesitant to try anything new.  I am a substitute teacher and at a high school I saw several of the young men smelling and passing around what looked a cigar.  I had to step in and investigate.  Turns out they were passing around one of these Cigar products.  It smells wonderful and it did not give me a headache!  I had to have some.  I ordered this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  It came in today (weather related delays) and he likes the smell as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making a product that both myself and my husband can enjoy.</li>
    <li> Packaging came torn and sloppy and it was a gift for my dad and arrived that way to him I was disappointed</li>
    <li> This was a nice gift for my dad to have since he likes the cologne. The only reason I didnt give it more stars is because one of the bottles were broken at the bottom when it got to him. Luckily my dad is easy going and said just forget about it cause I surely was going to complain.</li>
    <li> Not sure who did it but wrap around basket was ripped open, bottles all over shipping box, dented aluminum bottles, paint chipped off glass bottles and of course no time to return before it had to get wrapped.</li>
    <li> My husband like it. My son too and I shared between them. My son friends like its and he told them that I ordered this set on amazon.</li>
    <li> This, in my opinion, is NOT Cuba Gold! I have been wearing this fragrance for over ten years, and this is not the original Cuba Gold Fragrance.  It has a slight similarity, but is a bad copy, and even the lables on the bottles seem fake to me.  Why would someone want to make a knockoff of an obscure fragrance that isn&#x27;t super expensive to begin with?  I will pay the Thirty bucks at the mall from now on for the large bottle.  I am very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> My fiancee lived it. He smells so good with it on. I would recommend it to any man.</li>
    <li> The Fragance is perfect</li>
    <li> It supposed to be a gift, but it was not wrapped at all and above that the gift message was on Amazon order paper.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered gift before and it was wrapped and the gift card was separate from the order paper.&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> great gift idea A++++++</li>
    <li> The fragrance is great, don&#x27;t get me wrong. However it&#x27;s the packing which gets me. Once the box was opened and packing paper removed, the plastic around it was cut and damaged. There was also damage inside the box, but not outside. The product itself was in great shape, but seeing as I got this for my uncle as a gift I was not happy.</li>
    <li> I often wear Cuba Gold for men....and every time I do , I get so many compliments on the scent.  I works very well with my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> this stuff really surprised me.  It really has a great scent. bought it for my 18 y.o. son and he really likes it too.</li>
    <li> Smelled all of the colognes and they are all the gold. They smell delicious. He is young and I am sure will use them all pretty quickly. Also came in a nice bucket to put on a young man&#x27;s dresser. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this fragrance when I ordered the Cuba 4-pack sampler (also available from Amazon)... this was my favorite one in the sampler pack. I love this warm, unique and exotic fragrance, it is great for casual wear or to the office. I do a lot of face-to-face customer interaction and this scent is great because it is light and not overpowering with that musky smell so common in men&#x27;s fragrances. I receive many compliments on it from women and I&#x27;ve had a few men ask what the fragrance is because they are impressed by it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased some of these sets for gifts and even though they are inexpensive, they are visually impressive in the little wooden bucket. If you are looking to buy a gift for that man who has everything and enjoys wearing different fragrances, you&#x27;ve found what you&#x27;re looking for, my friend.</li>
    <li> good smell, cool design</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance, last all day and the price is great. I normally wear Opium and I like this just as well.</li>
    <li> when i open the cologne one of them was broking and so i want a refund. so you just made your self look bad</li>
    <li> Great value and I love the smell . Get plenty of compliments</li>
    <li> Nice gift set fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very nice gift set aftershave spray body spray and cologne!</li>
    <li> Very nice set to give to a young man. My son loves the fragrance, not too strong. Since he travels with sports the little one in tube he brings with him., which is convenient.The larger one is in a glass bottle.</li>
    <li> my husband love it but one of  the item came broke but over all its still A+++++ thank you and god bless</li>
    <li> Wonderful Value and Great Scent!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and it&#x27;s such a great set! It&#x27;s a great value and very cute set up.</li>
    <li> Very nice for a young man</li>
    <li> This gift set should have included a warning sticker letting you know whoever receives this is officially spoiled. I ordered this set thinking it would be just a nice gift set for a family member but when I received it I was surprised to see a real wooden bucket with all the included sprays and after shave held in place with a plastic tray. For the price I could not possibly ask more and the smells were great too!</li>
