      <li>order was quick and that was good as I&#x27;m  almost out.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find any others that I like...</li>
      <li>I find so many of them with a redish tint</li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t; love it and hope it never leaves me.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>They love this product and I assume are purchasing it.</li>
      <li>Love to buy them in stacks of 3 or 4</li>
      <li>Have used it for years and have never found any product better in this category.</li>

      <li>Terrific value for a great product.  </li>
      <li>Never irritating and so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The color looks just right on the pencil, but it goes on my eyebrows looking dark, and isn&#x27;t very easy to smooth out with an eyebrow brush (which I need to do with my eyebrows).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s waterproof,  a real plus!</li>
      <li>Produce was exactly as advertised.</li>

      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>The blonde is the perfect  color for me with lasting power, only have to retouch for those occasional nights I&#x27;m going out after wearing it all day.  </li>
      <li>They last a long time and for me, the blond one is a really nice color.  </li>
      <li>I have been using these for years, very natural looking.</li>
      <li>Even though my brows are dark, I use the blonde eyebrow pencil and it magically makes my brows darker.</li>
      <li>Most blonde eyebrow pencils are either red or dark.</li>

    <li> love my Avon j&lt;br /&gt;glimmersticks!!!!</li>
    <li> The best eyebrow pencil for me.  I have not been able to find any others that I like...and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.  I hope Avon keeps making them.  Even though my brows are dark, I use the blonde eyebrow pencil and it magically makes my brows darker.</li>
    <li> Have used this for a long time.  Very great product.</li>
    <li> Happy with product and shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched far &amp; wide to find an eyebrow pencil that works for me. I&#x27;m naturally blonde. These are amazing. If they ever go out of stock I pray the tattoo lady can do them as good as this pencil does.</li>
    <li> Love these eye brow pencils.  They last a long time and for me, the blond one is a really nice color.  I find so many of them with a redish tint and this is not.  I use a small brush to even it out after using it and it stays on all day.  I have been using these for years, very natural looking.</li>

    <li> The blonde is the perfect  color for me with lasting power, only have to retouch for those occasional nights I&#x27;m going out after wearing it all day.  Never irritating and so easy to use.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of eyebrow pencils and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Love to buy them in stacks of 3 or 4 so I have a future supply.  Good job, Avon..</li>
    <li> This item was just what I expected and I am very happy with the price and quality</li>

    <li> I have been using the blonde eyebrow pencil for years. It&#x27;s the only eyebrow pencil that isn&#x27;t too dark or has a reddish blonde in it. It stays put even on the hottest days of summer, The best part it&#x27;s not a pencil that we have to sharpen. The tip is always consistant, just twist it up.  I&#x27;ve never found a better pencil. I&#x27;ve never bought it from Amazon before but I will from now on. I don&#x27;t want anyone coming to my door. Glad as can be that Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> Produce was exactly as advertised. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been asked twice &amp;#34;Who does your brows?&amp;#34; and given two people a Glimmerstick/blonde to try.  They love this product and I assume are purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Just what I was looking for. Great price</li>
    <li> Very good, and the delivery was free.  However I think that one of the pencils enclosed was a silver color, which I did not order.  I will use it as an eyeliner, so am not too concerned.  Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and they&#x27;re exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Love these! Best eyebrow pencil out there!</li>
    <li> my brow gal turned me onto these and the tawny works great for my brunette brows and stays put all day!</li>
    <li> I needed these for a friend who was only in the country a short  period of time,  these are exactly as I wanted and shipped in excellent condition and super fast</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil appears taupe, not blonde, and is too dark.  Threw them out.  The pencil did go on easily, though.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal on these! I don&#x27;t use any other eye or brow liner except Glimmersticks. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Used for years &amp; still continue to use them.</li>
