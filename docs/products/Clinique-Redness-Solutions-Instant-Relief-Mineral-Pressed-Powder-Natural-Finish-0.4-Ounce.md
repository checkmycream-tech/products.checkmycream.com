<li> Would rather have the loose powder, but I will use this since I don&#x27;t have the option anymore.</li>
<li> It tones down the redness - it works instantly for me.  </li>
<li> Definitely tones down the redness in your face.</li>
<li> This product was definitely not worth the price--would not recommend it to anyone----did not live up to description</li>
<li> I have due to lupus.  </li>
<li> A poor, very poor replacement for the original loose powder.  </li>
<li> So if I ever find something that works as well and costs less</li>
<li> for application: throw the brush away and get a round, flat-ish make up sponge to apply.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a dude with really bad rosacea and while this is embarrassing to admit to purchasing makeup, this stuff really works!</li>
<li> I usually reapply at night if I am going out.</li>
<li> the coverage was not very good.  </li>
<li> so I was a little disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t work for my reactive redness.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just expensive.  </li>

    <li> For people who have problems with pimples as I do. It helps to dry and camouflage them very well. Its the best powder ever</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and does what it says, buy like all makeup it has to be reapplied after a few hours. It also has a tendecy to turn greasy later in the day. I use it to cosmetically cover up my rosacea. I just wish someone woud discover cure.</li>

    <li> This product is wonderful.  It is light and covers really well.  It last for me all day.  I usually reapply at night if I am going out.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the loose powder did.  I like the case and the storage for the brush.  Would rather have the loose powder, but I will use this since I don&#x27;t have the option anymore.</li>

    <li> A poor, very poor replacement for the original loose powder.  Clinique stopped production of a product that worked beautifully and put a pressed powder in a clumsy case.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I hit the Etsy market for a custom made product for 1/5 the cost.</li>
    <li> covers the redness and looks very natural</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have rosacea and I use this over my other makeup in those places that are especially red.  Works great!  It&#x27;s just expensive.  So if I ever find something that works as well and costs less I will go to that.</li>
    <li> Clinique has helped hide the redness and blotchy complexion I have due to lupus.  It is light feeling on my skin and does not cause blemish breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude with really bad rosacea and while this is embarrassing to admit to purchasing makeup, this stuff really works! It can pretty much cover over anything. While your skin won&#x27;t look perfect, it can make a HUGE difference...especially for those important social events.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and this powder is terrific at calming the redness I experience.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!

    <li> I&#x27;ve always had exceptional results from the Clinique line so I was a little disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t work for my reactive redness. To its credit I&#x27;ve used many different anti-redness concealers, primers and moisturizers to no avail. If your skin is hyper sensitive then this product might not work effectively in terms of coverage as it is very light. I use it to set my foundation and minimalize any redness that peaks through my liquid foundation.</li>
