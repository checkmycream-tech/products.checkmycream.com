      <li>Was just surfing my favorite online retailer Amazon and came across this product, I like Mizani  products</li>
      <li>However if I used more than a teaspoon, I felt that rather than penetrating the hair shaft, it sat on top of my hair making it look greasy instead of</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is light and not greasy so it won&#x27;t weigh your hair down. It does not dry it out like I was worried it would but it does need to be applied 2-3 times a week.  It is not hair grease after all.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product.  Did not work as well as Rose H 20.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product.  Took a while to receive the package though</li>
    <li> Mizanis Coconut Souffle is great for your hair ends; it keeps them moisturized. It&#x27;s also great for you scalp. My hair and scalp are extremely dry and I use it everyday-right before bed and again in the morning. There is no buildup and the scent is wonderful.     I did not care for the H20 Intense Treatment. It made my hair shiny and not moisturized.     Although this product might be a bit pricey for some, I trully believe that there are no short cuts in promoting hair growth. You will find some products that are expensive and some inexpensive that will work. Mizanis Coconut Souffle is worth every dime and depending on your situation, it may last atleast a month or so.     So, in a nutshell, if you have a dry scalp and want to prevent your ends from becoming dry and brittle, purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using a shampoo and conditioner that smells extremely good but extremely drying to my hair.....got a cut and hair looked horrible.  Was frizzy and very dry after washing and blow drying.  Went to get this at lunch and had to choose between three Mizani moisturizers quickly.  This one works very, very well.  It calmed my relaxed, parched hair down and relieved the dry puffy new growth.  I paid about $20.00 for it but I have paid higher for products that didn&#x27;t come through.  Bottom line, this works with no cakey build up or greasy feel.  I love it and will use daily.  This one is a winner. And I agree with the other reviewer.  This is great for your hair ends.  Now my hair looks and feels like it received a fresh cut yesterday.  :o)</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer , i&#x27;m so happy to find a staple moisturizer .It&#x27;s so light and it don&#x27;t weight your hair down just moisturize and seal with your favorite hair oil.I am relaxed 4a-4b hair  and my daughter 3c4b hair natural .it works for both.</li>
    <li> I WILL CONTINUE TO TELL YOU GUYS THIS PRODUCT IS  VERY GOOD  AND DOES NOT WEIGHT DOWN YOU HAIR, A MUST TRY IT</li>
    <li> i am a fan of Mizani products. This conditioner is the only one that does what I want a conditioner to do...provide me with silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Coconut Souffl&amp;eacute; is another winning product for my hair. It provides me with lightweight, non greasy smoothing that does not take away any bounce or curl-just makes it all so much smoother and better. I even use it on my ends between washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see this listed on their website though and I sure hope that it will never be discontinued !</li>
    <li> Once again another Mizani product lets me down :(    Pros: It is very light. This moisturizer will not weigh your hair down. I do like the smell which is a plus.    Cons: However, it&#x27;s almost too light. I don&#x27;t think it gives my hair enough moisture, which can be a bad thing. IDK maybe I should have tried the Butter Rich instead. Its also very expensive, i paid $20 for this. I have never paid $20 for a moisturizer before.  I really wanted to like this product. Normally, I love light moisturizers, but Mizani&#x27;s Coconut Souffle is so light that half of the time I&#x27;m not sure if it is working or not.    Update: i hate this stuff!!!! It dries out my hair.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 3/2015 - just about 4 years later I&#x27;m finally getting to the bottom of the jar! It is STILL the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  That is, I&#x27;m a white (pink actually) old lady with the frizziest pure white, wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many &amp;#34;frizz control&amp;#34; products I&#x27;d just about given up hope to find some lite dressing that could be applied to my hair after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, I gave it a try. Oh yeah!  My broken ends (a bad dye job bleached out) just soaked it up, and yes weighted it down too. But it was just the right combination to smooth out the frizz on the ends as well as soothing the grow out bits into submission. I could blow it out straight without looking like I&#x27;d been attacked by the straw hair demon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now morning and just a simple comb through brought my hair into shining compliance. My fingers can run though and it actually blows in a breeze. Other dressings held it all in place like helmet hair from the movie Steel Magnolias.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try it on clean hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive? Yes. But a small dime sized bit did the trick. This jar is going to last a looooong time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I checked out the Mizani web site that these products were mostly for black hair. Well, who cares? It works for this little old white lady. Yaaaaaaah</li>
    <li> In love already! Just opened and used it on my hair right after I washed it. It is an amazing moisturizer and feels as though I just had an relaxer. This product is a high recommend. Just hoping for even more amazing results after using it more.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this product but it leaves the driest part of my hair feeling a bit drier. **sigh** I paid twenty bucks for this ( no slight against the seller because mizani is WAYYYYY expensive so this is a decent price) and just feel that this product is so-so.   I have coarse hair that has some spots that get really dry ( picture so kinky and dry that it sounds like dry autumn leaves when touched). This stuff made it slightly moisturized, a little more shiny, but not enough that I can say it does a good job.On my freshly relaxed hair it gives a beautiful shine, but i have to mix it with some jojoba oil because it has a weird dry wax feeling to it.   As time goes on I will see and probably update this review. I&#x27;m going to try rollersetting with it.Maybe it&#x27;&#x27;ll be better that way or maybe not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American and have very kinky, tightly curled hair which is very difficult to manage.  Women in my family &amp;#34;hot press&amp;#34; their hair with a hot iron comb which is heated on a gas stove flame.  I don&#x27;t know how to do that, so I just normally have my hair braided to keep it under control.  But even when braided my hair is dry and unhealthy and damaged.  This product keeps my hair soft and healthy.  I keep it on my hair every other day or so, along with spraying my hair with bottled water.  Then I just twist my hair and place it under a wig.  I&#x27;ll soon learn how to hot press it, but for now, at least my hair is soft and comb-able and healthy... and smells good.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed but very spongy hair. It eats up anything that can absorb. Most of the time my hair is dry within 20 minutes from washing on its on, because it is so porous. I LOVE the way this product feeds my hair, without adding any weight to it. My hair stays soft and silky, especially after a flat iron. I cannot go anywhere without it! Also - great in kids hair! I do not use grease in my house at all, so my daughters use this as well. Its a great way to maintain the moisture in your hair, especially for African American women.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I was having some serious issues with my hair feeling dry and brittle.  I actually bought this product from my local beauty supply shop when I was desperate to restore some moisure to my hair.  It is mid-high price range, but I prefer to spend money on a product that works rather than trying multiple cheap alternatives.  I use this moisturizer in combination with other products.  The problem I had is I would find a product that gave me cute curls, but did not moisturize my hair, so even though my curls looked nice, my hair felt dry and brittle.  I like products Curl Keeper and Curl Junkie Curls in a bottle.  They give me nice curl defintion, but did not provide moisture.  After using them, my hair would look cute for one day then the next day, the curls would tangle because of lack of moisture.  Now, I use the products then apply a dime-quater size amount of Mizani coconut on top, and perfecto!  Looks good, has moisture, and curls maintain for 3 days.  I also like the Mizani intense H20, but use it only on my ends and the top.  Use the H2o sparingly, too much and your hair looks heavy.  I have type 3b/3c hair.</li>
    <li> I love Mizani but am not totally in love with this product. I love the smell, lightness and the feel of my hair when I first use it but after a while it seems that it has a drying effect after a while.</li>
    <li> This has been the best product for my 3b/3c hair and it has been working wonders, along with smelling fantastic. The hold lasts and keeps my curls soft, shiny, and refreshed even through humidity.</li>
    <li> This product I used for the first time. I was trying to find out whether it was suitable for my hair. I can only use it after I shampoo My hair only. It wasn&#x27;t what I really expected. i thought that I might be able to use it at all times. It&#x27;s not really for my grade of hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair creams I have ever used. It leaves my hair very soft and I no longer have to use gel to keep the frizzies in the front of my hair down. This works better than gel for me and it lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> We usually use mizani butter rich which we really like but decided to try this to change things up and this sounded like it would smell good. It doesn&#x27;t smell much like coconut. Has a chemical, perm like scent and doesn&#x27;t seem to condition well. My daughters are bi-racial and don&#x27;t need much conditioning but this didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
    <li> this product does make my hair softer and more manageable. I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t seem too greasy. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have petroleum or castor in it like most hair products for black women&#x27;s hair. I think it&#x27;s just enough moisture so that my hair is softer and shinier but not too greasy where it&#x27;s on the pillow.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has fickle hair. It smells great and is very light and didn&#x27;t seem to damage or weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair feels soft, moisturized from root to tip.  Previously used Marguerite&#x27;s Magic from Carol&#x27;s daughter... it was ok but this is great.. I love applying this to my ends along with Carol&#x27;s Daughter Mimosa Hair Honey as a sealant and my ends stay soft, very moisturized and tangle free unlike Marguerite&#x27;s Magic after a while.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells fantastic, and leaves my hair very shiny... It&#x27;s a bit pricey... but I will definitely purchase again until shown a cheaper product that works just as well or better.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair soft,  glossy and highly perfumed.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEEEEEE THIS PRODUCT!  I not only use it for my hair, but also for my face and the scent is wonderful!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very light weight and moisturizing once applied to the hair. The hair-dress is thick, but once you rub it between your palms, it spreads easily on your hair. Your hair will be soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have natural afro (4b/c) hair.  On the plus side, it smells great, has a light texture and, when you first apply the product, it leaves my hair feeling soft manageable and moisturised.  On the bad side, this feeling doesn&#x27;t last long and quite quickly afterwards my hair feels dry (or, if I apply too much, greasy!).  I will finish the product, but probably wont repurchase ...</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Not too sweet or overpowering. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed down or greasy. I went with this moisturizer because it&#x27;s okay for daily use and is mineral oil free! I don&#x27;t like Mizani&#x27;s rose h2o leave in (that one contains mineral oil, btw). The coconut souffle is the one for me. Just don&#x27;t use TOO MUCH of the product at once.</li>
    <li> I really love this mizani product. I use it every time I wash my hair and my hair ends so soft and silky. The coconut smell is awesome.</li>
    <li> My hair felt moist and silky when I first applied the product, but the feeling didn&#x27;t last long. It then had a drying effect.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! A little greasy so a little goes a long way. Great for hydrating your curls and holds good definition. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I needed to find a &amp;#34;hair grease&amp;#34; as some would say, that did not have a lot of water in it. For some reason any hair grease that has too  much water in it, turns my hair into a curly mess as if I just took a dunk in a pool. Well not this product. If you use a small amount (quarter size to half dollar) it goes a long way. This stuff not only makes my hair smell good, but it is not greasy and does not leave you wanting to scrub your hands with dish soap and paper towel. This product revitalizes my hair and brings back both a sheen and renewed texture to it. For me that means a little curl. I do use it as a helping agent for rolling my hair and it is awesome.</li>
    <li> omg this is beautiful and good, it makes my hair soft and manageable shine. its weightless, love it love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male and I love the fragrance and the texture that coconut souffle gives to mu hair. It leaves my hair soft all day long, and the coconut fragrance lasts all day too!</li>
    <li> Was just surfing my favorite online retailer Amazon and came across this product, I like Mizani  products so it was a no brainer to purchase.  I normally have greasy hair and was a little scared and to my surprised it wasn&#x27;t at all. it just dissolves into your hair with no greasy build up I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times and love it. And the smell is great</li>
    <li> I am a mulatto male with fine, yet course hair and this product gave me the moisture i needed in the north dakota climate i&#x27;m in and works very well to style my hair too!!</li>
    <li> I have ethnic hair and my husband has mediterranean hair. We both use it.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Mizani Coconut Souffle. It is exactly what my hair and scalp were craving. It absorbed right away and did not leave a greasy residue. I could barely wait to give my hair the much needed moisturizing treatment that it needed. My hair is more manageable and well conditioned. I am adding it to my new hair care routine.</li>
    <li> I love to use the Mizani moisture stretch on my daughters hair, So I thought we would give this coconut soufflé a try. To say the least I was disappointed in the product. It smells wonderful but that&#x27;s about it. If you want great-smelling natural hair,then use this product.</li>
    <li> My 1 year old granddaughter moved from Alaska in September. That climate is extremely harsh on black hair. She had hair all over but it was very short and always dry. I started washing her hair with Keracare Hydrating and Detangling shampoo and I bought this moisturizer because I personally like a cream rather than an oil based product. Well here we are 5 months later and she has a head full of healthy, shiny hair. It is still growing beautifully. Even using it on her hair everyday, the 8oz jar lasted almost 4 months. Well worth the price. If you search the net, you can find it some places for $15.</li>
    <li> Like it smells great. Could be better.</li>
    <li> The smell is not how it&#x27;s supposed to smell. after testing the same product is a shop. I definitely know it&#x27;s a fake product! The second fake one i bought from this very same shop!</li>
    <li> Amazing product with a great smell to it.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Works well with African American hair.  Keeps hair moist without a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. It made my natural 4C hair super dry and brittle. I washed it out the next day. Unfortunately, the seller has a no return policy. Boooo!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s so light and it smells great. It does not weight your hair down and can be used everyday. I can&#x27;t find this scent anywhere but on here so it&#x27;s s great buy for me.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughters&#x27; hair. It&#x27;s greasy and it smells nice. It gives their hair a nice sheen and keeps it moisturized and soft. It can get pricey so I only order it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> does not make your hair too greasy.  smells great.  not too thick or thin.  makes your hair very shiny and bouncy.</li>
    <li> thanks to UglyNBeauty, there&#x27;s no need to go to beauty school and receive a beauticians license, just to get a beauticians discount on a unique hair care product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the local retail vendor that sells Mizani products in my area continually overcharges the average consumer (in upwards of 2x&#x27;s the original value), since they&#x27;re the only vendor in the area that carries this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks to UglyNBeauty, i can buy in bulk and still save money.</li>
    <li> Great product. Adds moisture to your hair without adding weight. Highly recommend this product for just a light hair dressing.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t hold the moisture in for my natural textured hair.  Would be better for permed hair or for a daily moisturizer for someone with normal to oily hair.</li>
    <li> Smooths the hair and the smell is wonderful Great on African american hair, just the right amount of fragrance and oil.</li>
    <li> It is OK.  I do not like the smell.</li>
    <li> Always use in my hair. Use as a daily moisturizer with my oil.  Small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have definitely had very good results with the product. My hair is thicker and long. It is not a greasy product and leaves my hair manageble. Love it!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended that I use the souffle to build strength in my hair. Went to the beauty supply store and almost fell on the ground when I saw the regular price! But this seller&#x27;s offer for the product was unbeatable, and it came in two days after buying it. I hope to do business again soon. :)</li>
    <li> well i have not used the product yet and i am thinking of returning it, of course without opening and using the product</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it smells great, leaves my hair moisturize, and my edges intact. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hydrating for my hair and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell! It&#x27;s very light so your hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down after applying this product</li>
    <li> Great product, got this product fast will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing ... It &#x27;s lite, water based, and thick. I moisturizers without weighting my hair down .</li>
    <li> This product is so light abd smells amazing. I put it in my hair and it made it feel so soft yet so moisturized.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this at the salon. I LOVED it. So glad I found it on Amazon. it&#x27;s very light and the coconut smell is light. I only have to use about a dime-size amount about every other day so it should last a very long time. Not greasy at all. Quickly absorbs into the hair and adds great moisture.</li>
    <li> This is Amazzzzing, keeps my hair moisturized, hydrated, and manageable for styling. I have natural hair its great for when the frizz is getting out of control, for example I went and got a blow out and went out for my MIL&#x27;s birthday. We went to a club, danced the night away, and when I looked in the mirror I looked like a mix of a Chia Pet and Don King. When I got home I applied a quarter sized amount massaged it well into to my hair, wrapped it and called it a night. In the morning, my hair was back to normal, not as bouncy as my fresh blow out but much normal that I could go to work out and not be concerned with others looking at me as if I were crazy.</li>
    <li> So happy you are carring this product.&lt;br /&gt;And what a unbelievable price.&lt;br /&gt;Mizani is the best hair products on th market.</li>
    <li> Im looking for hair mousturizers to add to my hair growth regimen and so far this has been the best.I have relaxed hair and after a week i saw less breakage and it keeps my new growth under control.I also use coconut oil with this and together they work wonders.I was gonna try maybe a different product(because i like trying everything,lol)but i think i will stick with this..Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my thick, blonde, wavy/curly hair. Gives me softness and holds the curl better than no product. Leaves hair soft and shiny looking. You&#x27;ll need to experiment with the right amount of product. Too much leaves hair oily looking and heavy-- but I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now and will keep buying over and over. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Mizani brand so I was so excited to purchase this, I wouldn&#x27;t say I was dissappointed but it wasn&#x27;t wowed!&lt;br /&gt;You can use it as a grease twice a week. I&#x27;d rather buy Blue Magic for $10 cheaper and get the same results.</li>
    <li> The smell was very alcohol like. Not similar to what you buy in store.</li>
    <li> I have tried every product you can find.  I love this product!  It&#x27;s light, makes your hair soft without any greasy feeling at all.  Since I started using this product, the ends of my hair have stopped breaking off! I would recommend this product to &amp;#34;anyone&amp;#34; that desires soft, shiny, healthy hair without a weighed down greasy feel.</li>
    <li> This product is great for your hair and it smells good. It is lightweight and does not hold your hair down.</li>
    <li> Good product. Seems a little wet on the scalp. Smells good. Not at all heavy.</li>
    <li> I love my curls but this was sent to me as empty jars.  I cannot express my deep disappointment when feeling how light these jars were.  What&#x27;s more is that the seller has stopped selling this product and would not attempt to have the manufacturer exchange the empty jars for full jars--gone are the days of customer service.  I have enjoyed Ultra Black Hair&#x27;s Lotion Creme with olive oil for years.  I love my curls with that product.  I guess i&#x27;m going to stay with them since Mizani has no desire to \\&quot;do the right thing\\&quot;.  Or, at least this seller doesn&#x27;t wish to even attempt to make them do the right thing.</li>
    <li> I realize that everyone&#x27;s hair is different--I have relaxed (Mizani Relaxer) and dyed shoulder length hair. This product was really light at times and smells great. However if I used more than a teaspoon, I felt that rather than penetrating the hair shaft, it sat on top of my hair making it look greasy instead of moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, I used it on my child&#x27;s hair which is short and naturally curly and it is perfect! The texture is extremely soft after using it.</li>
    <li> Just used this product today for the first time it has been over 6 hours and my daughters hair is still nice and shiny and it isn&#x27;t oily! But it is a thick cream when applying it to the hair I would be worried it would weigh my hair down. I will try it soon.</li>
