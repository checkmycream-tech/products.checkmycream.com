      <li>I&#x27;m fair</li>
      <li>She has loved the color for years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful, rich color that stays on all day and remains moist.  </li>
      <li>(I have a light complexion with olive undertones).Regardless, it&#x27;s still a great color and great product.</li>

      <li>One of the better shades for colored people !</li>

      <li>Love this color.</li>
      <li>I love the color and formula</li>
      <li>I love this one.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite color lipsticks but the stores do not carry it.  </li>
      <li>Deep redish brown, looks good on fair skin tones.</li>
      <li>Order arrived very quickly, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love my lipstick and the color - and quick quick service!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the fabulous fig</li>
      <li>Also, they do not have a lot of matt lipsticks available.  </li>
      <li>Great color full opacity..lasts a long time on lips.</li>
      <li>Perfect dark red lipstick for olive skin.  </li>
      <li>Revlon lipsticks are first, class quality, lipsticks.</li>
      <li>This is my first time buying it in Matte</li>
      <li>Revlon lipstick is very quality.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was really fast</li>
      <li>Also very creamy for a matte, not drying.</li>
      <li>I really like this lip color.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks a lot for the fast shipment.</li>
      <li>The color looked tremendously pretty and I will be reordering another lip stick of the exact same color for back up :)</li>
      <li>so it really translates into a darker hue on my lips in comparison to my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I live in Georgia and i have got my order very fast</li>
      <li>Easily a dupe for mac Russian red.</li>
      <li>Fabulous Fig is a basic, matt brownish red colour.</li>
      <li>and it clearly looks dark, but it was a really light color.</li>
      <li>The lipstick stays on most of the day and is a matte which is hard to find.</li>
      <li>get a lot of compliments when wearing and this shade is not clownish as a classic red lipstick shade tends to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can wear it bold or lightly for casual day to day.&lt;br /&gt;The color, (in my opinion) is a rich/deep brown-terracotta color.</li>
      <li>Not too pink like so many other red lipsticks are.</li>
      <li>I really wish Revlon would bring this shade back or something similar.</li>
      <li>Color stays true and fades only slightly after eating.</li>

    <li> Perfect dark red lipstick for olive skin.  Not super dark, just right.  Also very creamy for a matte, not drying.</li>
    <li> I found this lip color in my sisters lipstick drawer. When I tried it on it looked so good on me then I decided to order one for myself. It&#x27;s a perfect color for my skin. I&#x27;m obsessed with this lipstick color. I will purchase this lippie again.</li>
    <li> Great fall color. Deep redish brown, looks good on fair skin tones. Won&#x27;t dry out your lips like some matte lipsticks do.</li>
    <li> They use the same picture for a couple different colors. Ugh! Went by photo and it clearly looks dark, but it was a really light color. Doesn&#x27;t look good on my skin and not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> MY FAV LIP STICK, can&#x27;t believe they quit making it...</li>
    <li> i gave this away to my aunt. they sent me the wrong color and without even looking at the bottom label I applied it but the color they sent that was wrong looks fabulous I didn&#x27;t like the fabulous fig</li>
