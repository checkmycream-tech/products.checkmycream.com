      <li>The bottle is huge and when comparing prices, this deal couldn&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
      <li>Huge bottle.</li>
      <li>Simply put it was what I wanted and it was at a great price compared to that at the department stores.</li>
      <li>Smells great, but scent is short lived.</li>
      <li>The smell differ from the original fragnance</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m familiar with the scent</li>

      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>my boyfriend first time using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>We purchased this cologne several years ago in Europe and it has remained a favorite.</li>
      <li>I first came across this cologne while walking through Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Liked this one due to size.</li>
      <li>This product has an outstanding and long lasting fragrance, and, when I wear it, I receive many positive responses from ladies.</li>
      <li>Authentic box factory sealed and would recommend to anyone that wants real cologne for the low.</li>
      <li>Very upset...</li>
      <li>Smells really good&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the real deal.smells amazing,great deal .</li>
      <li>AS MUCH AS DEPARMENT STORE.</li>
      <li>HOW EVER FAST DELIVERY.</li>
      <li>Got this for my son a few years ago, and guess he liked it as much as I did.  </li>
      <li>I prefer this over my others (Polo Blue, D&amp;G original, Burberry, Lacoste and Eternity).  </li>
      <li>I am not sure why a Prime product takes more than the two days, must have something to do with it being a brand name cologne, but so worth the cost savings.</li>
      <li>It smells just a little bit like Apple Pie, and who doesn&#x27;t love that?</li>
      <li>as normal Dolce &amp; Gabbana just makes quality products</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very nice but its projection is very weak.</li>
      <li>My Husband loves his new cologne, The One.</li>
      <li>My new fragance.</li>
      <li>my wife was able to buy the massive size bottle on Amazon for the same price as the middle size would cost in a department store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lines over the past 25 years and am picky about what I like.  </li>
      <li>Then it settles down and develops into a smooth lady killer.</li>
      <li>Huge bottle, but scent does not seems to last as long as it should.</li>
      <li>When I first put this on, the ginger was slightly overpowering most of the other notes in this scent.</li>
      <li>The same product was purchased prior to at a local department store and it was fine, stronger scent, and lasted all day.  </li>
      <li>You can get MORE for cheaper than the small bottles at the mall!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>My last bottle was much stronger and longer lasting.  </li>
      <li>I can barely smell it on myself and no one can seem to smell it on me..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this will be a repurchase down the road (it is hard to find what exactly I&#x27;m looking for as I can&#x27;t describe it), but I&#x27;d revisit the vendor for sure.  </li>

<li> I hope dolce gabana will keep this one in production for a long time.</li>
<li> A few squirts last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There - product and seller feedback in one.</li>
<li> It was what our son wanted for Christmas and it was cheaper here then at other sites.</li>
<li> Paid less for this than what a 3oz bottle costs at Macys.  </li>
<li> The product however must be old and outdated because the scent is weak and doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
<li> cologne everyday.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t wear everyday it because its almost unfair, almost like cheating.</li>
<li> Broken spray.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the large bottle size, the deal was too good to pass up and it is my wife&#x27;s favorite of all my cologne&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> A classic scent at a great buy.  Have ordered this multiple times.</li>
    <li> I recommend, great product</li>
    <li> Excelente in every way!</li>
    <li> Delivery was great and product is authentic. The fragrance is very nice but its projection is very weak. Also it does not last very long.  That being said it is still a good value because it smells so pleasant.</li>
    <li> My son lived it.  Delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> This is legit. Authentic box factory sealed and would recommend to anyone that wants real cologne for the low. I was skeptical too by reading others horror stories but I&#x27;m here to tell you fear not.</li>
    <li> I first came across this cologne while walking through Macy&#x27;s.  Saw the price and decided to give Amazon a look.  Wife eventually bought it for me as a gift and this is now my &amp;#34;goto&amp;#34; cologne everyday.  I prefer this over my others (Polo Blue, D&amp;G original, Burberry, Lacoste and Eternity).  I never realized how big a 5oz bottle was...</li>
    <li> You can get MORE for cheaper than the small bottles at the mall! I am not sure why a Prime product takes more than the two days, must have something to do with it being a brand name cologne, but so worth the cost savings.</li>
    <li> Amazing perfume. Smells grest and the bottle is huge for the price. It&#x27;s a great buying I strongly recommend you.</li>
    <li> We purchased this cologne several years ago in Europe and it has remained a favorite. I love the way it smells on him and this purchase was a HUGE bottle at a great price. Can&#x27;t go wrong with that combo!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend likes it and that&#x27;s all that matters :))  She says that it smells so good on my body ;)</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments in this cologne. I don&#x27;t wear everyday it because its almost unfair, almost like cheating. When I first put this on, the ginger was slightly overpowering most of the other notes in this scent. Then it settles down and develops into a smooth lady killer. I like wearing this dressed up.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but it does not appear as concentrated as the tester that i used while traveling through airport.  Huge bottle, but scent does not seems to last as long as it should.</li>
    <li> Chose this product because it has a scent that my wife loves and sold at the right price. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my son a few years ago, and guess he liked it as much as I did.  Now it&#x27;s on the standing order list .</li>
    <li> The order/shipping process was fine and fast.  The product however must be old and outdated because the scent is weak and doesn&#x27;t last.  The same product was purchased prior to at a local department store and it was fine, stronger scent, and lasted all day.  Not the case this time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last even for hour</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband because of all if the favorable reviews. I had never smelled tthis fragrance before. It is a wonderful fragrance. One that I think a woman could wear, too. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. The price was good, too.</li>
    <li> I paid 58 dollars. The bottle is huge and when comparing prices, this deal couldn&#x27;t be beat.  The box comes sealed.  I had to go online to &#x27;find&#x27; my scent. I&#x27;ve tried many lines over the past 25 years and am picky about what I like.  I was looking for musk, and this product delivers.  I&#x27;m not sure if this will be a repurchase down the road (it is hard to find what exactly I&#x27;m looking for as I can&#x27;t describe it), but I&#x27;d revisit the vendor for sure.  A few squirts last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There - product and seller feedback in one.</li>
    <li> one of mt husbands favorite fragrances</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the scent</li>
    <li> 100% Authentic, when it says ships and sold by Amazon it&#x27;s the real deal.smells amazing,great deal .</li>
    <li> My new fragance. Everybody loved it the first days I used it.</li>
    <li> Broken spray. Tried to return but unable. Will have to figure out a way to use it. Very upset...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  The price was good, the delivery was on time and will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> The smell differ from the original fragnance</li>
    <li> very good, on time, excelent product</li>
    <li> Love it. Huge bottle. Great price.</li>
    <li> I have ordered The One from several sources before and this one came quickly and is an awesome size for the price.  I am thrilled.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this cologne. It smells just a little bit like Apple Pie, and who doesn&#x27;t love that? It lasts enough so by evening I can still smell him (up close anyway) but it is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m familiar with the scent and I almost fainted when I saw a 5-ounce bottle at this price. Purchased - packaging was great, everything was direct from manufacturer (I was suspicious at this price point that I&#x27;d get a knock-off or something), factory sealed, everything was top-notch.</li>
    <li> Best deal anywhere on my favorite cologne. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I actually love the scent - but this bottle was VERY weak for some reason, sort of like it was watered down.  My last bottle was much stronger and longer lasting.  Maybe they changed the recipe...</li>
    <li> Great deal for this cologne very happy.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this cologne and I love it.  Best part is the price...my wife was able to buy the massive size bottle on Amazon for the same price as the middle size would cost in a department store.</li>
    <li> Ok.  Here goes  I own BOTH  the one from MACY&#x27;S the $110 version and I bought this one from AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both smell the same. I would wear 1 one day to test it then Amazon one the next for week asking people what they thought. I would use same people for a week. They all said same thing couldn&#x27;t tell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:::  Amazon one DOES NOT LAST. Maybe 4-6 hrs as for Macy brand 8 hrs  Not that bad.  I have the Macy&#x27;s bottle at home n carry the Amazon &amp;#34;The one&amp;#34; in the car.  or in my tool bag got to smell good so if I break bottle not my good one</li>
    <li> Smells great, but scent is short lived.</li>
    <li> It was what our son wanted for Christmas and it was cheaper here then at other sites. He was happy.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT , THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST , ALL THE ITALIAN  COLOGNE, ARE THE BEST I PERFER THIS COLONGE FOR EVERYONE</li>
    <li> Smells really good&lt;br /&gt;Just my favorite</li>
    <li> I DID NOT LIKE THE SCENT AS MUCH AS DEPARMENT STORE. THE SCENT SEEMED NOT AS GOOD. HOW EVER FAST DELIVERY.</li>
    <li> very good I liked it because its a nice product,&lt;br /&gt;its my boyfriend first time using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Its great.&lt;br /&gt;its came on time for my boyfriend. Shipment was great, thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it... he says it&#x27;s one of the best cologne&#x27;s he has ever used... as normal Dolce &amp; Gabbana just makes quality products</li>
    <li> This product has an outstanding and long lasting fragrance, and, when I wear it, I receive many positive responses from ladies.</li>
    <li> is not authentic.&lt;br /&gt;not recommended, because in addition can not be returned.&lt;br /&gt;I made a very bad bargain with this fake perfume</li>
    <li> love it. I hope dolce gabana will keep this one in production for a long time. Liked this one due to size.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING, but the smell fades very quickly. I can barely smell it on myself and no one can seem to smell it on me..</li>
    <li> Simply put it was what I wanted and it was at a great price compared to that at the department stores. I saved 35 - 40%.</li>
    <li> I like the smell a lot, I just wish it would last longer (of course, maybe I just get used to it and don&#x27;t notice it after a couple of hours). Good price, glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments from the ladies and the guys...</li>
    <li> The price was real good and the time that it got to me was fast I would buy this product again and recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> Same cologne i always buy.  Paid less for this than what a 3oz bottle costs at Macys.  Great deal for the money.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves his new cologne, The One. It smells great also.</li>
    <li> dolce and gabbana is one of my best colon I&#x27;ve bought</li>
    <li> the best.... i love it</li>
