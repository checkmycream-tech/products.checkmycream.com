<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got these to try something different from the Neutragena oil blotters I usually get. I like how I get more for my money and that they&#x27;re organic. They do what they say and more these is better for my extremely oily skin.</li>
    <li> Works great and has simple ingredients!</li>
    <li> I use these when my forehead gets oily. Love them!</li>
    <li> Great at removing oil from my face (and from my fingers).</li>
    <li> These work very well. I don&#x27;t think they get out as much oil as some of the ones that I have bought in store, but they do a pretty good job all the same!</li>
    <li> This keeps my face matte and cool at all times</li>
    <li> Very nice large sized sheets.  Much larger than the regular kind of buy in the store.  Works well for my oily skin!</li>
    <li> These oil absorbing sheets are simply amazing. They work perfectly, and they absorb the excess oil from my face in a matter of seconds. After applying them, there&#x27;s zero shine on my face! I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone fighting with bad skin, or even for those with good skin that just want to take care of themselves the way they should. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> They okay. I find the boscia much better</li>
    <li> I used to buy little blue sheets like this, I have not seen them in retailers in a long time. I love how they absorb all the extra oil from my face. They are in a small pack perfect for my purse. I can use them over makeup, so touch up without interfering with my makeup.</li>
    <li> **Pros**&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderfully&lt;br /&gt;Size&lt;br /&gt;Eco-friendly&lt;br /&gt;Not too thin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Cons**&lt;br /&gt;Crinkly sounding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always looking for eco-friendly products so when I was asked if I would give an honest review of this product in exchange for a discounted price I quickly agreed. I&#x27;ve always used the little blue oil absorbing sheets from Clean and Clear, but after trying these I could never go back to those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that these weren&#x27;t super thin, they&#x27;re about as thick as a piece of paper, with them being that thick they did have a crinkly sound to them that I found annoying, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal. I love the size of these, they&#x27;re big enough that I can blot my whole face. The packaging is small/slim enough that it&#x27;ll fit right in my smallest purse without taking up room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed that they didn&#x27;t take any make up off. I always had that problem with the blue sheets. I would blot my face and my makeup would be missing from the areas I blotted my face. These LiveFresh green sheets kept my makeup in place, but took the shine out. That&#x27;s an A+ from me!</li>
    <li> Truth be told I don&#x27;t wear make-up. It&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m some flawless cover girl. It&#x27;s mostly because I&#x27;m a combination of lazy and very concerned with putting chemicals on my skin. These little oil absorbing sheets come in real handy in the afternoon to remove natural oils from the skin. They&#x27;re really big so I usually just use half a sheet and save the other half for later. Yeah, that&#x27;s a pro tip for doubling your absorbing sheets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw this bugger in your purse and use it on the go. Oh, I did wear make-up recently for a wedding and these guys worked well over make-up too. Very minimal &amp;#34;run off&amp;#34; onto the sheet.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:89a4049da07f5a2731a796d4d751d8e6]] These blotting sheets are small pieces of thin paper (sized 3 7/8\\&quot; x 2 3/4\\&quot;). They are a little stiff, I expected a velvety finish of a paper blotter but they are not velvety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that originally I did not like how the sheet felt against my face straight of the package. However, I found that if I crumple each sheet first it feels less stiff and more pleasant to touch when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blotting paper removes access oil and shine from my face or even access face cream or sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sheets are provided by LiveFresh Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> Like rubbing paper on my face, also doesn&#x27;t appear to absorb up much of the oil.</li>
    <li> These are nice blotting sheets!  Unlike other brands I have tried, one sheet will go a lot further in terms of removing extra oil from your face.  I especially like that they are made from natural materials.</li>
    <li> I really like these, they don&#x27;t leave any powered residue. They really absorb the oil on my nose.  I&#x27;m gonna give these to my mom hopfully she&#x27;ll enjoy them.</li>
    <li> I got a good deal on these, so I bought them without much thought. When they came I saw they were organic so I knew they would be safe for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m so impressed with these. They take so much shine off my face! Excellent quality. I know keep this pack in my purse to use on the go and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my &amp;#34;tween age&#x27; daughter who has combination skin; oily in the T zone. Surprisingly she knew just what these were and just what to do with them ( thanks, YouTube). She was really happy I bought these for her; I almost had thought she would take offense. I was given the opportunity to test and try these. I put her to work. She immediately used one and did not have much to say. About an hour later on our way to dance, she said, &amp;#34;Mom, you know, I think those blotting things really works. My nose doesn&#x27;t look like a hub cap.&amp;#34; Exact words. That&#x27;s 2 thumbs up, right??&lt;br /&gt;I really like these for her. They are gentle, all natural and there are 100 of them! Great purchase for a young tween.</li>
    <li> Received these a couple of days ago they are amazing! I like how absorbent they are and how much they take in you only have to use one for your whole face! These are going to be a repurchase for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of blotting paper. I was surprised at how large the sheets are and how absorbent they are as well. The package was generous with the amount of sheets too. This is great for some one with oily skin to help get the oil of without screwing up your makeup. I use these a few times a day on my forehead and just love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> VERY WONDERFUL SHEETS ABSORB OIL VERY GOOD WITHOUT REMOVING MAKEUP</li>
    <li> Good price for a good product. My son has oily s join and uses these. No powder like some have. Just absorbs oil and leaves nothing behind on his face.</li>
    <li> Love the size of these and that they are organic. Best oil absorbing sheets that I have tried</li>
    <li> They work just like they are supposed to and I was surprised how well they work.</li>
    <li> Great at removing oil but it also removes my makeup.</li>
    <li> Amazing Oil Absorbing sheets!!! I just bought these for my wife to try, as she was complaining about the heat &amp; humidity and how oily the face becomes, working long hours... Although I was expecting these to be a bit bigger in size (I had not read the dimensions), this seems to be the perfect solution for her and she is really happy. its the perfect compact size to fit in her purse, pocket or clutch. I did not think I would write be happy but here I am.. happy and also writing a review about it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these!  Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Yay I am so excited to have found this product! IT WORKS! It&#x27;s a nice little pack that gets rid of that excess oil and it&#x27;s small enough to keep handy in my purse so I can take it on the go!</li>
    <li> Does not do great job; will be sticking with neutrogena</li>
    <li> Works for my bridal kit</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL!! Sheets do a terrific job of removing oil from face. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> My son loves using these!! This is a great find!!</li>
    <li> I love having these in my purse!</li>
    <li> Horrible! i tried many and this have to be the worst, the quality is like toilet cover seat paper. not worthy.</li>
    <li> I have had a chance to try these out at a great rate! I used them thinking I had very little oil on my face to begin with. So to my surprise just about the whole cloth was oily afterwards. I&#x27;ve attached a photo. I Have to say these were packaged great and easy to handle when using. At the same time they are very sturdy and strong. I would suggest these sheets for anyone who has a oily skin problem. You will not be disappointed with the quality you are getting for your money! Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are more effective than I had thought blotting papers would be. I have extremely oily skin, so I can use more than one sheet at a time, but they actually do take away shine at the moment and keep my skin shine-free for longer. I was surprised. I plan on buying these again.</li>
    <li> These oil absorbing oil sheets do exactly what they say..absorb oil. I try to purchase these when I can especially during promotional offers. They are a must to have in my purse. By mid-day, my face starts to get shiny and oily. These sheets help take away the oily and shiny look. After blotting my face with a sheet, I refresh my make-up and I look like I did in the morning after applying fresh make-up.</li>
    <li> I like the sheet size, but I wish the package had an adhesive that would separate the sheets when needed, sometimes I would grab 3 or four at a time because they stick together. Also, the sheets do as they are supposed to: absorb my nasty grease and oil throughout the day. These are not my favorite sheets though, I still prefer the drug store brand. This sheet absorbs my oil but it is very spotty. I have an oily face EVERYWHERE so I have to get every spot!</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very oily. My entire face is oily on a daily basis.  These oil absorbing sheets work well. You will never know how oily your face really is until you have use one of these just to see if there is oil present. Using these will find all the  oil on your face and absorb it right into the paper thin sheet.  These are great for traveling.  You&#x27;ll never know when you might need one</li>
    <li> I do not like the material of these. It&#x27;s similar to that of the toilet paper seat covers.</li>
    <li> I love it, they work great</li>
    <li> These work VERY well! Used to think blotting paper was for girls only, and would laugh at my girl when she used them. I started using them a few months ago, and what a HUGE difference. I&#x27;ve notice not only I look a whole better (your don&#x27;t realize how oily your skin is until you use these) and I also notice I don&#x27;t get any acne or spots anymore. Even if you try to wipe off excess oil with TP or a paper towel it still hardly does anything. Try it, use a paper towel, and use these right after. These papers will STILL pull up a lot of oil from your skin to give your skin a natural flat look. No more shiney face! I still feel less manly using these, but damn they work good so who cares. Better than a greese-face.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i ordered or received such a product.This is very nice quality blotting paper!  I love the little pack they are stored in, easy to remove one sheet of paper at a time and store the rest in your purse or makeup bag .These absorb  excess oil or shine on your face. These sheets are nice and thick too so they won&#x27;t tear while you use them and  can see the oil that they absorb so you know they are working.&lt;br /&gt;I really do like how these oil absorbing blotting sheets work. I tend to moisturize my face quite a bit, even before I put on my makeup, so quite often that shine will come through.Samples provide to test and review.</li>
    <li> the LiveFresh Organic Oil Absorbing Sheets works great. it&#x27;s been over 100F outside today and my oil production has been crazy on my face. I do have some mineral makeup on my face to help control the oil production. But mid-day, I used two of the absorbing sheets to help tame the mess and it worked very nicely. the sheets are nicely scented, nothing over empowering. the size is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** i received this with a discount to provide my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> Great costumer service. Works fine. Thought them were smaller, good thing they are bigger than expected.</li>
    <li> Large enough to do your whole face. Does not remove makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. I formerly used the clean &amp; clear product, but this organic alternative is much more pleasant in its sustainability and value.</li>
    <li> I love these oil absorbing sheets. I have oily skin and and use them frequently during the day. I will order again and again.</li>
    <li> What can I say about oil absorbing sheets? Most of us gals need them and they&#x27;re super handy to have around, especially in the hotter months of the year. I got to try these free and they work great. I like that they&#x27;re organic but mostly I like the size of the pack, it fits perfectly in a purse or even wristlet so you can keep these handy on those nights out on the town. Would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Its the bestttttt product i used for oil absorbing, when you use your face look like the matte effect, really love it!</li>
    <li> I discovered oil blotting sheets when I was in my 20s and clubbing, because sweat &#x3D; oil, and I didn&#x27;t like having a shiny nose and forehead. A nice thin pack fit into even the tightest pants, and it was an easy fix that didn&#x27;t even require a mirror. Oh, and FYI, it&#x27;s great for blotting lipstick, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LiveFresh Organic has taken it up a notch by making Oil Absorbing Sheets infused with soothing green tea. In addition, they&#x27;re made from 100% abaca leaf fiber, making them green on top of it. Interestingly enough, they are green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very thin and have a texture similar to rice paper, but hold up well to use. I tried it on my nose, which is both oily and reddish, and it eased both problems right away. The soothing aspect lasts, too...I didn&#x27;t even need powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There doesn&#x27;t appear to be a scent or any allergy concerns, other than green tea, but as with any new item, testing on a small area is probably a good idea. The package is super slim, about 1/2 inch, but it holds 100 sheets, so you&#x27;re good to go for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may not hit the clubs anymore, but these will still be a regular in my purse, for all those touchups a busy mom needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for testing and review purposes. My opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of absorbing the oil from your face.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter had hit that phase when her forehead and nose are starting to look greasy so when I was given the opportunity to purchase the oil absorbing sheets at a special price to test for quality, I was excited.  The are compact, around 4&amp;#34;x3&amp;#34; and about 1/4&amp;#34; thick, small enough for her to throw into her backpack and have them whenever she needs them.  They dispense one at a time and work really well.  I tried one on my face that did not seem that oily and you could see the grease marks on the sheet.  I was amazed.  They do not leave any residue on your face and are organic which means they are safe to use on sensitive skin.  These blotting papers are a life saver for anyone who experiences that embarrassing oily look.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try these out because my teenage daughter is prone to very oily skin that causes break outs and can be embarrassing at times. You can clearly see that her skin is oily and she hates it. She has a good skin care routine, but, it seems at certain times of the day she just produces more oil.&lt;br /&gt;  We had her try the LiveFresh Oil Absorbing Sheets to see if it could pose as a solution for those times when she is out and about and has skin issues. She carried them in her purse at school and when she was hanging out with her friends . She used them whenever she noticed she was getting a little oily. She says she loves them. I could see a big difference in the appearance of her skin and most of all, the amount of breakouts that were occurring.&lt;br /&gt;  I like that the sheets are organic. Our family likes using organic products. I feel better about using organic and non chemical options when purchasing products for my family. These are great! I will be a returning customer for sure!</li>
    <li> Great oil absorbing sheets! My only gripe is that it is difficult to just get a single sheet out of the package- I always end up pulling more than one out at a time</li>
    <li> I received a discount on this product, but all thoughts are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer with oily skin in my T-Zone and on my chin. It can make it frustrating to keep my makeup looking fresh. I use makeup as a cover up to my breakouts and so the last thing I need is MORE oil developing to cause more breakouts. The packaging for these was small enough that it fit in my purse and didn&#x27;t take up much space. I was able to use them on the go and keep myself looking fresh without having to wash my face all over again and reapply my makeup cover. Also with the sun beating down, I live in my sunglasses. I hate that excess oil that builds up on my nose from this and so these sheets were GREAT for making that a non-problem. I think it&#x27;s great that there are oil absorbing sheets out there that don&#x27;t remove our makeup. Sometimes you want the shine gone, but you don&#x27;t want a makeup remover. These are perfection.</li>
    <li> I have never tried absorbing paper before, lucky me, I was looking for something different when I found this, this product is excellent and it does what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> My skin can become very oily through out the day and especially with the weather warming up it does not help. I have tried other oil absorbing sheets and they just do not work. This livefresh oil absorbing sheets have been the best one I have used. The sheet really absorbs the oil from my nose and face, after blotting the oil off my face there is no oil left. I was shocked after seeing the sheet after I used it, I never realized I had that much oil on my face, other sheets did not absorb as much oil from my face as this one. I am so glad I got this during my promotion to try, I really did not want to spend too much but now I will be getting more of these and passing them around to my girlfriends. Already got a few ordering these sheets.</li>
    <li> My face is SUPER oily so I was a bit hesitant to see if these actually worked. Guess what?? They DO work!! Only 1 sheet was needed to take care of my face, and didnt mess up my makeup. These are now in my makeup bag in my purse because I cannot leave home without them. This is a definite in my beauty arsenal. ((sample provided))</li>
    <li> These really help to keep my pores clear by absorbing the oil on my skin.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter&#x27;s engagement photo shoot; she really liked them.  She said they didn&#x27;t disturb her makeup at all, but they were very effective at soaking up oil and sweat.  The day of the photos was 90+ with high humidity, so she need two sheets per &amp;#34;mop up,&amp;#34; but thinks one would be plenty under more normal conditions.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product ! Easy to use anywhere and leaves your skin refreshed and oil free. Love that it is eco friendly and has natural ingredients. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I needed to purchase some of these for myself and my daughter and when I saw these on a promo to give them a try I was so excited. I LOVE that they are organic! I dont like putting junk on my skin! They really take away that shine and oil to keep your skin blemish free! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been noticing how oily my face tends to get around my nose. It&#x27;s been bothering me so I decided to buy some of these. They work and that&#x27;s all that matters. My face feels oil free. It&#x27;s also nice that these sheets are organic.</li>
    <li> One of my students commented that I look shiny. I immediately searched for oil blotting sheets. I&#x27;ve never used any kind before (I didn&#x27;t realize I had a shiny issue). I blotted about three times a day. After each blot my skin would feel extremely dry in those spots so naturally my skin would produce more oil to moisturize. I used it for a few days but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This is just ok and it does take off your makeup</li>
    <li> excellent product to give teenagers to carry in their backpack or use at home.</li>
    <li> It sounded good and I wanted to try something different. Each sheet is very thin and it is easy to be torn when you try to use it on your face.  I just pressed this sheet a few spots on my face and it was torn so easily. It does a job but I don&#x27;t think it is as good as &amp;#34;Clean &amp; Clear&amp;#34;. I am going back to &amp;#34;Clean &amp; Clear&amp;#34; sheets.</li>
    <li> These blotting sheets are just okay.  They do not have the same texture as other oil absorbing sheets I have used and don&#x27;t seem to do the job as well as others.  I have tried many different oil absorbing sheets and I have to say that Selma Hayak&#x27;s brand is the absolute best.  They are more pricey, but like the say...&amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  I had high expectations for these as there are promoted as organic...but I don&#x27;t think this makes any difference.</li>
    <li> I love these for my face.  They help keep the shiny at bay on my t-zone area.</li>
    <li> Daughter said they did not work as well as other much cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> NOT GOOD WIPES! They rip after a few swipes because you have to apply a decent amount of pressure for them to pick up any oil! All around, not a great experience - they&#x27;re even hard to get out of the container. I grab 2 sheets at a time because it&#x27;s so hard to maneuver the container. Not a great product, I recommend using others!</li>
    <li> Love the organic and natural product</li>
    <li> These work great. My teen and I both have been able to make good use of them.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> My face is oily in the T-zone area.  These large sheets work great to absorb excess oil. I blot my nose and forehead before applying makeup, and usually once again in the afternoon.  They eliminate shine and don&#x27;t disturb my makeup.</li>
    <li> small package but easy to carry in my purse  ... so much better than caking powder on</li>
    <li> Great item.Highly recommended</li>
    <li> These blotting papers by LiveFresh Organic are fantastic. In the past, I&#x27;ve used the Clean &amp; Clear version which work perfectly fine, but you only receive 50 sheets per package. If you are using these pads 1 to 3 times per day, you can imagine packs do not last particularly long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being organic and made from all natural ingredients, LiveFresh Organic&#x27;s blotting paper comes in a pack of 100 sheets which is far more convenient and requires less frequent purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of oil absorption, these blotting papers collect/absorb just as much if not more oil than Clean &amp; Clear (they are slightly larger in width / length). As an added bonus, LiveFresh Organic provides a 27 page e-book on healthy skin tips which was an unexpected surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that battles heightened levels of oil production throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Fantastic sheets, it really feels you are fresh all the time when using them. I have tried lots of different brands and I&#x27;m happy to say I have found the best ones! Recommended!</li>
    <li> Its hard to find products that are easy on your skin and that can be used with make up, but this is one of them. They fit perfectly in my purse and I have caught my husband using them :) I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> These are great for travel.  I love to take them on overseas flights to keep from having oily skin.</li>
    <li> Great product and works great. Small pack fits well into the smallest purse.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and it is so frustrating!  Over the years, I have faithfully carried Clean and Clear oil absorbing sheets in my purse but not now since I have tried these sheets!  Before I would have to use two sheets within a few hours of putting my makeup on but with these sheets I only need one.  I will be buying these from now on.</li>
    <li> Great to have during the day. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> These absorbing sheets are the best ones. I love them even more because they&#x27;re organic and they don&#x27;t have a scent or anything. These things come in handy too.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these sheets would be as good as everyone said they were, but I see no difference between these and regular oil blotting sheets. I had to use two to get oil off of all of my face and I found myself using them every couple of hours, which is the exact same use as generic brand ones. The sheets are also very brittle and they tear easier. They also take off a lot of makeup which is something regular oil sheets don&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> They are okay. I usually use the oil sheets from Proactiv which are a whole lot better, which rhey dont sell anymore. With the Proactiv sheets I can put it on one spot and it will immediately pick up all the oil without me even having to apply pressure. But with these oul sheets I have to apply a good amount of pressure and press it in the same spot a few times before it picks up. So they are decent, closest thing to the Proactiv ones.</li>
    <li> Very good product and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  These papers aren&#x27;t shiny like some others; the shiny ones don&#x27;t absorb as much oil, I think.  My only quibble is that I wish they were larger!</li>
    <li> amazing product, by far the best ive tried over the years!</li>
    <li> Nice product, I appreciate the fact the sheets are organic and safer for the skin.</li>
    <li> Good product, good value, prompt shipment</li>
    <li> The oil sheets absorb alot of the oil on my face, but they are a bit thin and rip easily. Sometimes I need to use more than one sheet for my entire face. Would purchase again as well as recommend.</li>
    <li> SIZE MATTERS!  I am use to the smaller little sheets of oil absorbing sheets and was HAPPY to see the size of these!  Will order again!!!!</li>
    <li> Not bad, not the best. I&#x27;ve tried several brands of these and still like Clean n Clear the best. Those seem to be higher quality, and the paper has some sort of plastic content, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb water I might have on my fingers or on the sink.</li>
    <li> These blotting papers are terrible! They are no better than using a disposable toilet seat cover. That&#x27;s what these feel like, a toilet seat cover!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  They arrived quickly and are all natural.  Perfect size to fit in your handbag.</li>
    <li> These are nice to have, they work just like any other blotting paper! Very good for people who have oily skin like me</li>
    <li> I love that these are a little bigger than brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past. They are very efficient; I only use 1-2 sheets at a time rather than 3-4. I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Good quality product!  Perfect for quick touch ups!  Definitely buying this again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I guess my skin isn&#x27;t greasy enough because I didn&#x27;t really notice much on the sheets.</li>
    <li> I like em...control shine without adding powder.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;oil absorbing sheets&amp;#34; are described as &amp;#34;The #1 Best New Organic Blotting Paper&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Our product is also eco friendly and uses 100% natural abaca leaf fiber.&amp;#34; The item does not have the certified organic stamp on it. Plus nowhere on the item or packaging does it indicate what the product is made of (e.g., abaca leaf fiber).</li>
    <li> Unlike the ones from the store, which are more soft/plastic-y in feel, these feel like a thicker tissue paper. However, they work just as well as the store-bought ones I typically use, and are much larger. I cut mine in half and they are almost the same size as the store-boughts. And now instead of 100 sheets, I have 200 sheets. I occasionally need to use two of them when I am particularly oily, but I did the same with the others. For the price, I&#x27;ve just doubled the amount I normally got. These papers don&#x27;t &#x27;slide&#x27; across my face, as I could with the others. You do have to press firmly and move from place to place without sliding, or they rip. They are absorbent, though. The one downside I am still trying to figure out a way around is how to get them out of the box easily. Double sided tape might work, but I suspect the paper would rip. I&#x27;ll likely buy them again.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic - big oil blotting sheets for my big ol&#x27; face and T-zone! I&#x27;m not really big on wearing makeup but I live in a really humid city and my face will glisten pretty regularly. I love that these are twice as big as the fancy ones from Crabtree and Evelyn, they&#x27;re half the price of the fancy kind, and they work just as well. When you think of it that way, it&#x27;s a total bargain! These do exactly what they say they do - they allow you to dab away the shine on your face and stay fresh-looking all day.</li>
    <li> These work great! Very convenient to take on trips.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I never had problem with excessive oil on my face, so I found a perfect way to use the oil absorbing sheets. Recently, I have started to use more oil products on my hair and  when I get around my  edges, I tend to have excessive oil left there. So these sheets are perfect for removing that oil from around the edges of my face. I always like to find additional ways to use anything I get and this works perfect for me. In addition to get the most out of things, you probably can tell I like to get the best price too. The answer is  yes, I got this at a great price and I hope that my experience with the oil sheets can help you out too.</li>
    <li> Does its job. Its amazing to see the oil on my face at the end of the day</li>
    <li> Little weird to get used to, but I&#x27;m going to blame that on me never using these blotting papers before. They do the job and do the job VERY well. I have a very oily face complexion and these things soak the oil up like a sponge.</li>
    <li> This are great papers. I&#x27;m used to the blue ones, but these are much more discreet when throwing them away.  Glad they weren&#x27;t loud either, thought it would be similar to throwing away a tampon wrapper, but no stealth mode was needed to dispose of these. They do tear if you&#x27;re not careful, but hey it&#x27;s paper... paper tears. The thing I really like about these are that they still leave a healthy glow but not a shine on my face after I use them.  No one likes an oil slick for a face, but I also don&#x27;t want to walk around like I used some weird phone filter on my face to make it look super matte. Get these.. they are worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> At any given time I would have to say I have combination skin. Especially when I&#x27;m wearing make up. Sometimes different areas of my face will look oily if I&#x27;ve been wearing make up on all day. These blotting papers work exceptionally well. I think that&#x27;s because they are naturally infused with green tea, which soothes, protects and freshens my skin. They are perfect for that mid day touch up because it doesn&#x27;t smudge my make up, it just removes the excess oils and shine leaving me with healthy naturally glowing skin. Plus they do not irritate my sensitive skin. I love that the sheets are in a cute purse size pack that makes them perfect on the go. Please note that I received these organic oil absorbing sheets for the purposes of product testing and reviewing. All statements made in this review are solely my own personal experience using this product. That being said, I would absolutely recommend these to friends and family members. Also they make perfect gifts.</li>
    <li> Soaks up oil, and works as it says. I&#x27;d buy these again for sure. The paper wasn&#x27;t thin enough to be easily broken as I was using it. I like the packaging and the quality of sheets. These are the best quality of oil absorbing sheets I have ever used. I never knew that these could be made organically but since they are, that is definitely a plus. I received one of these to test and review and to give my honest opinion. These are the best, I like them and I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are amazing. I pulled one out and gave it a wipe and there was a lot of oil on the paper. I went over the same spot with another section of the wipe and there was nothing. My skin felt smooth and clean (non oily).. This is an amazing product that is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I am constantly on the lookout for products that will help me eliminate the shininess that I get every day. I was super excited to buy these Oil Absorbing Sheets at a promotional price and be able to share my experience with them here with you. Theses sheets arrived quickly and undamaged. They were nicely packaged in a clear plastic wrap. I&#x27;ve tried oil blotting sheets in the past and while they worked fine I have never seen an organic variety like these so I was excited to see how they were compared to others and honestly these worked just as good if not better than other types I have tried! They are very soft and gentle and you can use them on top of your make-up and they won&#x27;t cause any smudging you will only be left with awesome matte skin! These are perfect to put in your purse or travel bag as they come in a nice little dispenser. These would also make the perfect edition to a little gift bag, basket or stocking!</li>
    <li> bye, shiny face now. Great product</li>
    <li> Best blotting sheets I&#x27;ve used ever (way better than the Clean and Clear blue ones). The sheets are large and I only need one for my entire face and i have oily acne-prone skin</li>
    <li> WOW!!!!! This is definatly a good and truth showing product!!! I was surprised to see how much oil came off my face, especially since I really didn&#x27;t think my face was oily!!! These are not full of chemicals like many other beauty products nowadays, which is a wonderful thing! You get one hundred in the pack, so these will last a very long time. The package is very easy to use and its very easy to get one out at a time(other blotting oil absorbing papers I have used get stuck to each other so its a mess). Normally after applying a light cover up and powder I see the oily shine from my moisturizer come right through, which I hate!!! Now I can use one of these(yes one does do entire face) and get rid of the unwanted shine and not mess up and leave marks on my face. These fit in my make up bag, not taking up much room, so I can always be prepared to unshine myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these oil absorbing sheets at discount for an HONEST review</li>
    <li> These are the best oil blotting papers I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and works great.  Like the fact they are all natural with no odor.  Didn&#x27;t realize my skin was so oily until I started using these.  Using a sheet before putting on makeup makes for an easier time smoothing it out..</li>
    <li> I use this after I work out from the gym and it gets up all the oil on my face.  I don&#x27;t like to wash my face aftee a workout because I do want to see some of my natural oils but I also don&#x27;t want to look shiny. This gets out all the shy without drying my skin.</li>
    <li> Great sheets- fits in purse nicely and helps eliminate oil and shine throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is very nice quality blotting paper! These sheets are 3.93&amp;#34; x 2.75&amp;#34; in size and are packaged in packs of 100 sheets, they will last quite awhile. I love the little pack they are stored in, easy to remove one sheet of paper at a time and store the rest in your purse or makeup bag without taking up a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work great at absorbing excess oil or shine on your face. I used them after I applied my makeup today and they worked very well keeping my makeup looking nice throughout the day. While wearing glasses sometimes my nose will perspire under the nose pads, these wipes worked great absorbing any excess oils without disturbing my makeup. These sheets are nice and thick too so they won&#x27;t tear while you use them.  You can see the oil that they absorb so you know they are working, yes I know,...ewww.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like how these oil absorbing blotting sheets work. I tend to moisturize my face quite a bit, even before I put on my makeup, so quite often that shine will come through. These work great as a final touch before walking out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free product sample received for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well! I loved the promotional offer and will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> These blotting papers work good, they don&#x27;t leave behind extra powder and they are in a thin small package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I had with the packaging was they were a little hard to get out, but I managed it just took an extra second and a moist finger to slide it out, I don&#x27;t know that there is a solution to that but maybe having them a little tighter in the package. I&#x27;m not sure. However that didn&#x27;t effect the effectiveness of these blotting papers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no noticeable scent with these papers so this was good. They are a pretty color and I could see that they were working, that something I like about blotting papers, you can see that they are doing what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
