<li> Love this product for volume and lift it gives my roots when I blow dry upside down.  </li>
<li> will probably last a long time</li>
<li> I&#x27;m always feeling self conscious about how little volume/density I have to my hair and it makes it a constant challenge to style.</li>
<li> The bottle lasts a long time and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with the sprayer clogging or not working.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have fine, thin, limp hair.</li>
<li> It thickens my hair from the root and absolutely delivers volume and height in the root of my very heavy hair for days!</li>
<li> Product works well to give volume but it made my hair dry.</li>
<li> I have also read reviews on Sephora where a few people reported it stopped working if used daily</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll be using this as long as its in production!!!!</li>
<li> It is unlike any other volume product I have used because my hair does not get tacky and it fluffs up my hair, for two days.  </li>
<li> And unlike some other products it does not irritate my scalp.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and have never found anything even remotely close to giving my hair volume!  </li>
<li> I generously mist it into my damp hair around the roots, comb it through and flip my head over to blow dry and round brush it upside down.</li>
<li> Did not work as advertised, and certainly not worth the money.</li>
<li> I have thin hair and it usually falls flat.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone with thin hair needing a boost.</li>
<li> I have a difficult area in my bangs and this manages it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped, but it does give my hair some extra texture.</li>
    <li> Smells GREAT.  So-so for 48hr volume.</li>

    <li> I have tried all types of products for adding volume but this is the only one that does not make your hair greasy feeling after a day.  It leaves a clean feel to your hair and for me it lasts for up to 4 days.  I have very fine hair and cannot wash my hair every day.  It is pricy.</li>
    <li> I get this product from my hair dresser it&#x27;s creates lasting fullness for my fine hair w/out weight or stickiness.</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised.  Will not reorder</li>

    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. It thickens my hair from the root and absolutely delivers volume and height in the root of my very heavy hair for days! I absolutely recommend it! :-)</li>
    <li> This is the best new product Ihave purchased in years.&lt;br /&gt;The shine, the control and the volume just the absolute&lt;br /&gt;Best.  No heavy products on your this does not weight down&lt;br /&gt;Your hair, it does not make your hair feel as if you have product,&lt;br /&gt;Just a clean moveable shine hair.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair has thinned out and with the Alterna Bamboo I get volume and my hair really does look full and bouncy the next day.  I purchased two.  Don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.</li>

    <li> Awesome product. I have a difficult area in my bangs and this manages it so well I don&#x27;t need to touch up my bangs all day.</li>
    <li> I try a LOT of hair products but this is one of the TOP ones. Their hairspray is also terrific!</li>
    <li> Works for some volume if used in addition to mousse. Did not work as advertised, and certainly not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It is unlike any other volume product I have used because my hair does not get tacky and it fluffs up my hair, for two days.  Really!</li>
    <li> On my second bottle, love this it ads volume and shine, will always try to keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> The Best.  I have really fine hair...this stuff is MAGIC!  I instantly and ALL DAY have volume.  I literally cannot believe this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and have never found anything even remotely close to giving my hair volume!  Hallelujah! :)</li>
    <li> product is authentic and as promised .It came fairly quickly .Product in and of itself it slightly drying but after I washed my hair most of the residue came right out.I would use it when I go out or need and extra oomph but I would not use it every day or would just use it at the roots so the ends stay silky.I have also read reviews on Sephora where a few people reported it stopped working if used daily but this was not everyone &#x27;s experience .It will probably last a long time bc I will use this on occasion not all the time .For everday I really love callista tools embellish expand thickening styling cream bc it gives my hair a soft non-stiff volume. The alterna product is great for day one but It feels kind of dry and stiff on day two.</li>

    <li> Product works well to give volume but it made my hair dry. Had to wash it out the following day and reapply.</li>
    <li> This has really worked for my hair.  It actually does give me more volume and I need that.</li>
