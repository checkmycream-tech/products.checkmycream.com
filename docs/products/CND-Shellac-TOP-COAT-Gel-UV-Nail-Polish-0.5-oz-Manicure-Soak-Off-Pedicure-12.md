### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s been the answer to getting beautiful looking nails that don&#x27;t split, crack, and break.</li>
      <li>Great price on a product of the highest quality.</li>
      <li>Best top coat I have found for Shellac nails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for me because the quality of this product is good and my varnish is good for many days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am really happy this is an awesome product definitely worth the money-</li>
      <li>Definitely good value - just make sure you compare prices!</li>
      <li>and you have to take a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and rub the top sticky layer off and viola!</li>
      <li>I love CND!</li>
      <li>now that I can do this on my own</li>
      <li>This polish process is phenomenal and it looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>I was just looking for a nice top coat...</li>
      <li>I  love  the quality and durability of shellac.</li>
      <li>The top coat is fantastic and self-levels nicely and keeps its shine for weeks.</li>
      <li>But then, I read online more about shellac</li>
      <li>and  top  </li>
      <li>Genial con el vendedor y el producto también :)</li>
      <li>Another useful note is that the top coat when cured can even be filed like an acrylic nail.</li>
      <li>When cured the nails look smooth and even.  </li>
      <li>I find the CND line fantastic.</li>
      <li>it is ok, there&#x27;s no other better top coat at Amazon.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re perfect and shiny and dry ready to go</li>
      <li>v e r y was fast, all the appropriate quality.</li>
      <li>The only issue I had with ordering this online was whether it would be authentic Shellac top coat, and it is and it works like it is supposed too.</li>
      <li>I am not a nail professional and honestly didn&#x27;t really understand the product I was buying.</li>
      <li>product was packaged nicely and arrived earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Last longer which is nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to grow my natural nails out to a reasonable length for me (longer, if I wanted)</li>
      <li>several  other  brands of  gel  polishes  with  very  good  results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommend this product and the whole SHELLAC line of colors!</li>
      <li>This product is exactly like the product only available to nail technicians in Canada.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend the entire system (although I got my light from a different brand)!</li>
      <li>A little more work, but worth it to me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I apply another color coat and a final clear top coat.</li>
      <li>I had tried many other gel brands before hearing that this one applied like a polish and much easier to use.  </li>
      <li>Had been going to local salon for shellac but after hubby commented on how nice my nails looked decided it meant a long term comittment.</li>
      <li>Then I use my fine buffer file and remove any height differences off the nail surface and dry wipe to remove filing</li>
      <li>I just probably should have looked into directions a little better haha.</li>
      <li>After 2-3 times I have been able to do a french manicure as well as the local salon.</li>
      <li>By the time the first one was getting to be too thick and not as easy to work with, I was wondering wether it made sense to buy the bigger size, but then checked &amp;, realized I had had the first bottle for more than 1 year &amp; used it regularly for my french manicures.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time in new condition.</li>
      <li>Love the hard cast shell look</li>
      <li>paintbrush is a little bit big, but I have a bigger quantity than usuel, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Well, in my case, I have nails that are a little bit wavy or irregular when they get to a certain length.</li>

<li> Yes, it works, finish result is nice and shiny, i have a little problem when applying because it is so thick and being clear sometimes is hard to avoid cuticle</li>
<li> I only use this brand and contrary to others who say if ruins your natural nails, it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> I was SUPER annoyed when this stuff wasn&#x27;t drying...</li>
<li> Seems to dry out on the brush over time.  </li>
<li> I fix this issue by doing the following: apply the SHELLAC base coat, a SHELLAC color coat, then a thick clear SHELLAC top coat and cure each as directed and wipe with the ISP alcohol as directed.</li>
<li> Because of this system, my nails are hard and last the 2 weeks as promised.  </li>
<li> Everyone should try it at least once.  </li>
<li> I thought it was a bunch nonsense about an expensive product.  </li>
<li> But I was unable to grow nails before CND.  </li>
<li> I was soooooooo wrong.  </li>
<li> I also  use  the  shellac  base  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I  will never use regular  polish again, I  have  been  using shellac  for  over 2  years  at  home. I  love  the quality and durability of shellac. I also  use  the  shellac  base  and  top  coat  with  several  other  brands of  gel  polishes  with  very  good  results.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly like the product only available to nail technicians in Canada. This saves me lots of money and time by having the opportunity to have this product at home</li>
    <li> The only issue I had with ordering this online was whether it would be authentic Shellac top coat, and it is and it works like it is supposed too.</li>
    <li> I am not a nail professional and honestly didn&#x27;t really understand the product I was buying. I was just looking for a nice top coat...&lt;br /&gt;So I was SUPER annoyed when this stuff wasn&#x27;t drying... FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking, what a rip off. But then, I read online more about shellac and you have to take a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and rub the top sticky layer off and viola! They&#x27;re perfect and shiny and dry ready to go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am really happy this is an awesome product definitely worth the money- I just probably should have looked into directions a little better haha.</li>
    <li> I only use this brand and contrary to others who say if ruins your natural nails, it doesn&#x27;t.  Because of this system, my nails are hard and last the 2 weeks as promised.  I&#x27;ve been able to grow my natural nails out to a reasonable length for me (longer, if I wanted) and I get compliments on them wherever I go.  I strongly recommend the entire system (although I got my light from a different brand)!</li>
    <li> Genial con el vendedor y el producto también :)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as described. Love the hard cast shell look</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in new condition. Great price on a product of the highest quality. I love CND!</li>
    <li> Until I tried shellac I thought it was a bunch nonsense about an expensive product.  I was soooooooo wrong.  This polish process is phenomenal and it looks amazing.  Everyone should try it at least once.  now that I can do this on my own I may never go back to regular polish!</li>
    <li> Of course you will need the entire line of products to keep your nails protected.  But I was unable to grow nails before CND.  I had tried many other gel brands before hearing that this one applied like a polish and much easier to use.  Last a couple of weeks if care is taken in applying.  I have been using this product for just over a year and can&#x27;t imagine living without it.</li>
    <li> Had been going to local salon for shellac but after hubby commented on how nice my nails looked decided it meant a long term comittment. After 2-3 times I have been able to do a french manicure as well as the local salon. What a savings in $$$ and time. I learned to keep all product out of even indirect sunlight as it will start to harden at exposed neck of bottle.</li>
    <li> SHIPPING AND HANDLING:&lt;br /&gt;This product was packaged nicely and arrived earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY &amp; APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the CND Shellac products for 12 months now.  The top coat is fantastic and self-levels nicely and keeps its shine for weeks. Another useful note is that the top coat when cured can even be filed like an acrylic nail. Why would you want to do this?  Well, in my case, I have nails that are a little bit wavy or irregular when they get to a certain length. I fix this issue by doing the following: apply the SHELLAC base coat, a SHELLAC color coat, then a thick clear SHELLAC top coat and cure each as directed and wipe with the ISP alcohol as directed. Then I use my fine buffer file and remove any height differences off the nail surface and dry wipe to remove filing dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I apply another color coat and a final clear top coat. When cured the nails look smooth and even.  A little more work, but worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product and the whole SHELLAC line of colors!</li>
    <li> it is ok, there&#x27;s no other better top coat at Amazon. I wish I knew if there is...haven&#x27;t found it yet</li>
    <li> Best top coat I have found for Shellac nails. I also like the larger size bottles.  Last longer which is nice.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works, finish result is nice and shiny, i have a little problem when applying because it is so thick and being clear sometimes is hard to avoid cuticle</li>
    <li> I find the CND line fantastic. It&#x27;s been the answer to getting beautiful looking nails that don&#x27;t split, crack, and break.</li>
    <li> D e l i v e r y was fast, all the appropriate quality. G o o d 100 %.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I bought. By the time the first one was getting to be too thick and not as easy to work with, I was wondering wether it made sense to buy the bigger size, but then checked &amp;, realized I had had the first bottle for more than 1 year &amp; used it regularly for my french manicures. Definitely good value - just make sure you compare prices!</li>
    <li> The bottle had leaked when I received it.  Seems to dry out on the brush over time.  Still works well.</li>
    <li> I use this product every two weeks. It&#x27;s perfect for me because the quality of this product is good and my varnish is good for many days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paintbrush is a little bit big, but I have a bigger quantity than usuel, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
