      <li>It worked great on my hair!  </li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>And the seller are great</li>
      <li>Although this is attractively designed, it has rubber tips in place of bristles.  </li>
      <li>This is a most excellent product for scalp massage, even distribution of hair and leaving your hair on your head and not in the brush.  </li>
      <li>We tried the Crave brush and we all loved it.</li>
      <li>I love that it works great</li>
      <li>i love this brush!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Amazing how this works.</li>

      <li>I also tried the brush on my own hair.  </li>
      <li>She has very fine hair</li>
      <li>Really glad I got it.</li>
      <li>and i love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I am sure we are going to fight over this one.</li>
      <li>I really do love this brush.  </li>
      <li>This brush feels good on your scalp, really does get out tangles by magic and it looks and feels nice.</li>
      <li>Ingenious design.</li>
      <li>We got the pink Crave Naturals brush to try for free and my son was so impressed he wanted one for his own.</li>
      <li>My grand daughter age 10 says the brush is very good in detangling especially after shampoo.  </li>
      <li>love the handle... easy to use, A+++ product ... will order again since NOW</li>
      <li>Ordered two .... works better than the original HAIR BEAN ...</li>
      <li>This goes through easily and breaks up the tangles well.</li>
      <li>The brush can be cleaned easily.  </li>
      <li>so it gets tangled easily.  </li>
      <li>Right now the way its configured, it fits my left hand the best.  </li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t stop brushing her own hair all night last night after I opened up this box, and again this morning she was able to comb through her own hair by herself without pulling out a bunch of hair.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t find it helpful for fine hair.</li>
      <li>have fine curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair that tangles when I wash it like something fierce.  </li>
      <li>got one of these brushes free for review.</li>
      <li>So naming the original a lefty and making a new one with the opposite curves and calling it a righty would be great!</li>
      <li>When I looked up the similar detangling brush, it did not have as good reviews.  </li>
      <li>My hair is always full of tangles I sometimes cut out.</li>
      <li>The bristles are close together and when my hair dries, it really looks fine and smooth.</li>
      <li>But I LOVE how shiny, soft, and untangled it makes my hair look</li>
      <li>It is suitable for all different types of hair too.</li>
      <li>This works exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>my husband wants one too!</li>
      <li>/&gt;We received a pink Crave Naturals brush in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>I sleep with my hair braided to keep it from getting as tangled as it could but the braids still get loose at night and the hair around the bottom of my neck (top of the braid) gets tangled.</li>
      <li>It probably works well for a child, coarse hair or to detangle, but I have fine hair</li>
      <li>I like this brush so much</li>
      <li>I also really put the brush to the test when I tested it on my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>The brush is really neat because it can be used as a scalp massager too.</li>
      <li>Mom, It really works.\\&quot; He was sold and so am</li>
      <li>We got this brush for our six-year-old daughter who often has very tangly hair.</li>
      <li>I really can run my fingers through it.</li>
      <li>Works really well</li>
      <li>it really works the tangles out.  </li>
      <li>This really worked for us.  </li>
      <li>It would cost too much to return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  </li>
      <li>None have really worked until now.</li>
      <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I will be buying more for my other daughters.</li>
      <li>It deals with tangles better than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Contacted the company and got an almost instant response, they immediately sent out a replacement in the beautiful dark pink color just like her Mommies.</li>
      <li>My one suggestion to this company would be this:  Make a right and a left hand style.  </li>
      <li>I typically have to spray in a ton of water or detangling spray to get a brush through it easily.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s been using the brush every day for about a week and instantly it got all her tangles out in the first use.</li>
      <li>My grand daughter used to have the worst hair and refused to brush it because it hurt and now she loves to brush her hair and it works beautifully for my hair as well.</li>
      <li>The specialized brush works very well for fine and delicate hair.</li>
      <li>This one he said, \\&quot;Wow,</li>
      <li>I cannot say how surprised I was at the wonders of this brush.</li>
      <li>I have a curly perm and frequently find knotted up hair after sleeping.</li>
      <li>My 6 yr old daughter has a lot of fine, wavy hair that&#x27;s usually a struggle to get through in the mornings or after a shower.  </li>
      <li>BUT he wants long hair.</li>
      <li>I have long, straight hair that always seems to look tangled.  </li>
      <li>I can finally brush my 3 year old daughters hair without her complaining.</li>
      <li>I can see in the near future</li>
      <li>keep my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair on the short side because it can be a hassle to comb through before school in the mornings.  </li>
      <li>It left our hair looking soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>It really does everything it&#x27;s supposed to - DISCLAIMER: I NEVER brush my hair while it&#x27;s wet</li>
      <li>I am not left handed though so it does make using it a little ungainly but not impossible.  </li>
      <li>She has waist length, thick lovely hair (and not much tolerance for my pulling and tugging to undo the plentiful tangles).  </li>
      <li>i have straight, long, but dry hair (i am 65).</li>
      <li>So definately not for thin or fine hair.</li>
      <li>It really does glide through hair with ease and little effort.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just ordered another one to have as a backup.  My 6 yr old daughter has a lot of fine, wavy hair that&#x27;s usually a struggle to get through in the mornings or after a shower.  She didn&#x27;t stop brushing her own hair all night last night after I opened up this box, and again this morning she was able to comb through her own hair by herself without pulling out a bunch of hair.  This really worked for us.  The box also came with a coupon code so I got a discount on my second order.</li>
    <li> This definitely helps in detangling and combing my wet hair. The bristles are close together and when my hair dries, it really looks fine and smooth. It does take awhile to comb but wait pays off.</li>
    <li> We got this brush for our six-year-old daughter who often has very tangly hair. She&#x27;s been using the brush every day for about a week and instantly it got all her tangles out in the first use. She loves this brush.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever used. The customer service for the company is amazing. I am looking forward the the next email from them with hair care recipes included. I will probably be purchasing another brush like this. Thank you for a great customer experience!</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair on the short side because it can be a hassle to comb through before school in the mornings.  It is even difficult when her hair is kept short.  She has very fine hair so it gets tangled easily.  I typically have to spray in a ton of water or detangling spray to get a brush through it easily.  I want to introduce you to the glide through Detangling Brush from Crave Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a brush that can be used on children and adults.  The brush helps reduce breakage and split ends.  I love that it works great and my daughter doesn&#x27;t get upset when I comb through her hair.  It really does glide through hair with ease and little effort.  It makes our mornings easier.  I also tried the brush on my own hair.  My hair is very similar texture to my daughter&#x27;s.  It worked great on my hair!  I also really put the brush to the test when I tested it on my husband&#x27;s hair.  He has very thick wavy hair.  It usually takes him a bit of effort to comb his hair out.  The Detangling Brush made brushing his hair very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has some additional benefits as well.  It smooths the cuticle layer.  It left our hair looking soft and shiny.  The brush is really neat because it can be used as a scalp massager too. My daughter loves this feature.  The brush can be cleaned easily.  It is suitable for all different types of hair too.</li>
    <li> i love this brush! i never write reviews but this brush And the seller are great and i had to say it! ill be ordering more for my mom and sister and every lady in my family lol</li>
    <li> I sleep with my hair braided to keep it from getting as tangled as it could but the braids still get loose at night and the hair around the bottom of my neck (top of the braid) gets tangled. I also had a bad habit of letting it go for a day without brushing (if I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere). I hated to brush it because of the tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush changed that. Even after two days of not brushing it got the tangles out without hurting. I have used it every day since I got it and I love it! I will be using it till it falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got one of these brushes free for review.</li>
    <li> This brush delivers as promised. Ingenious design. Highly recommend. The specialized brush works very well for fine and delicate hair. I am ordering extras!</li>
    <li> My definition of a brush is something made with bristles.  Although this is attractively designed, it has rubber tips in place of bristles.  It works to massage the scalp, but not to actually brush hair.  This is the one, big disadvantage to buying on line.  Had I actually seen it, I would not have bought it as not what I was looking for.  It would cost too much to return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  It probably works well for a child, coarse hair or to detangle, but I have fine hair and I don&#x27;t find it helpful for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Ordered two .... works better than the original HAIR BEAN ... love the handle... easy to use, A+++ product ... will order again since NOW my husband wants one too!</li>
    <li> I did not see how this helped at all.  For me, it was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that tends to tangle after I have been out in the wind.  This goes through easily and breaks up the tangles well.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter age 10 says the brush is very good in detangling especially after shampoo.  She has waist length, thick lovely hair (and not much tolerance for my pulling and tugging to undo the plentiful tangles).  It is a winner!</li>
    <li> This works exactly as advertised. I can finally brush my 3 year old daughters hair without her complaining. I like this brush so much, I will be buying more for my other daughters.</li>
    <li> I cannot say how surprised I was at the wonders of this brush. I have a curly perm and frequently find knotted up hair after sleeping. Two or three swipes through my hair with this brush solves the problem.</li>
    <li> i am ordering a second brush...  i have been using one for about 3mo. and i love it.  i have straight, long, but dry hair (i am 65). and this brush is just the best.  it really works the tangles out.  i must have 2...one as backup!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical seeing a similar brush on TV.  I have long, straight hair that always seems to look tangled.  I also have issues with breakage.  When I looked up the similar detangling brush, it did not have as good reviews.  So I got this one instead when it went on sale.  It really does everything it&#x27;s supposed to - DISCLAIMER: I NEVER brush my hair while it&#x27;s wet so I don&#x27;t know how it works on wet.  But I LOVE how shiny, soft, and untangled it makes my hair look/feel.  I really can run my fingers through it.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for my daughter and when it arrived it was a little off from the picture on amazon.  Contacted the company and got an almost instant response, they immediately sent out a replacement in the beautiful dark pink color just like her Mommies. This is a most excellent product for scalp massage, even distribution of hair and leaving your hair on your head and not in the brush.  Works so well, I had to buy one for all my family members.</li>
    <li> A total game changer!! I was dreading this fall with my twin girls heading off to preschool and oldest daughter in 2nd grade. No worries now!</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life!??&lt;br /&gt;Love it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine curly hair. Threw away everything else . I only need this for wet or dry hair</li>
    <li> Awesome &amp; durable! My daughter says it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
    <li> I sent this back. Was for myself and my youngest girl. We both have thin curly hair and it pulled our hair out. So definately not for thin or fine hair.</li>
    <li> Having two girls with medium to long hair, brushing hair has been a battle over the years. Not doing so just makes the task more difficult. We have tried a variety of different brushes and detangling brushes. None have really worked until now. We tried the Crave brush and we all loved it. I am sure we are going to fight over this one. I can see in the near future I am going to have to buy another one if not two.</li>
    <li> My son hates getting his hair brushed BUT he wants long hair. We got the pink Crave Naturals brush to try for free and my son was so impressed he wanted one for his own. That is how we ended up with the white one. (Boys don&#x27;t want pink brushes). We even bought a Michel Mercier brush prior to this one and he really disliked it. This one he said, \\&quot;Wow, Mom, It really works.\\&quot; He was sold and so am I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received a pink Crave Naturals brush in exchange for an honest review. We did this review because we were so impressed! [...]</li>
    <li> Amazing how this works. My hair is always full of tangles I sometimes cut out. This brush feels good on your scalp, really does get out tangles by magic and it looks and feels nice. Really glad I got it.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter used to have the worst hair and refused to brush it because it hurt and now she loves to brush her hair and it works beautifully for my hair as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works really well</li>
    <li> I really do love this brush.  I have baby fine hair that tangles when I wash it like something fierce.  This brush has bristles long enough to work out the tangles without pulling my hair out by the roots.  My one suggestion to this company would be this:  Make a right and a left hand style.  Right now the way its configured, it fits my left hand the best.  I am not left handed though so it does make using it a little ungainly but not impossible.  So naming the original a lefty and making a new one with the opposite curves and calling it a righty would be great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, and I love it. It deals with tangles better than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My daughters fight over this comb it works so well.  I might be forced to buy another.</li>
