      <li>Thanks a bunch!!</li>
      <li>I continued using twice a day &amp; the soft tissue hardened very quickly into what seemed to be new healthy nails.</li>
      <li>However, once I switched to direct application, my results got much better much faster.</li>

      <li>I bought into the hype that this was somehow different (or better) than tea tree oil.</li>

      <li>This product is everything we expected and more...</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Manuka oil cured my toenail fungus &amp; restored my toenails so fast</li>
      <li>The oil is amazingly effective at treating these problems; I had results in less than 12 hours!</li>
      <li>Make sure you get UMF-certified Manuka Honey because others are not pure and will give you only a fraction of the true healing power of UMF honey.</li>

      <li>If you are a parent of young children battling MRSA, then I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I had thr impression it was diluted with other cheap plant oil. ..</li>
      <li>I say use this stuff if you have skin issues as it does help but be prepared and have an air freshener nearby plus a natural fragrant oil!</li>
      <li>You should still get good results with the diluted version but mine were not as dramatic as from direct application of the oil.</li>
      <li>If you find direct application of the oil too strong for some reason, you can try diluting it by placing just a few drops in a little water and/or witch hazel, mixing, and then dabbing it on the area to be treated with a clean cloth.</li>
      <li>WOW    </li>
      <li>I used the oil over the paint &amp; achieved a complete cure.</li>
      <li>I have had this problem since I was a seven years old.</li>
      <li>I am also an esthetician and have access to so many different products, but I prefer to use this for breakouts due to it&#x27;s instant results, and the fact that it is all natural.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Manuka Oil, and I believe everyone should keep a bottle of it around for various purposes.</li>
      <li>It works very well for fungus and dry skin.</li>
      <li>We saw a marked difference before the third day of use (applying morning and evening each day) with lightening of his nails and the splitting of his nails has not progressed.</li>
      <li>and you can barely smell it.</li>
      <li>I use Manuka Oil to clean, numb and quickly heal minor wounds as well as a spot treatment for adult acne and fungal infections.</li>

<li> I ordered the Manuka Oil and after a few the days the rash was over 50% reduced.  </li>
<li> I bought this to help with my husbands nails, as his toenails have been discolored and heavily ridged for years.</li>
<li> It actually dried up the loosened fungal part of the nails, which then cracked off.</li>
<li> Only downside is it smells bad so only use at night.</li>
<li> smelled like and felt like an ordinary plant oil..</li>
<li> It reduces red, angry, inflammed pimples overnight and clears small ones in a day or two.</li>
<li> I will not claim that Manuka Oil &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; MRSA, but it most definitely helps heal the nasty boils that are a symptom of this nasty infection.</li>
<li> I ordered it, but not impressed..</li>
<li> A bit expensive but the bottom line is it works.</li>
<li> I was absoultely shocked to get these results.</li>
<li> I have ordered from this company for years and never been disappointed.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s awful.</li>

    <li> it&#x27;s not that I disbelieve that manuka oil has helped others with toe nail fungus...but for whatever reason my nail fungus got FAR FAR worse. It was only in the upper corner of one nail at start and now it&#x27;s gotten deep into my nail bed and there is a hole in my nail at the bed...it&#x27;s awful. I don&#x27;t know why this happened, but it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find out why this happened.</li>
    <li> The oil works great on my stubborn toe nail fungus. A bit expensive but the bottom line is it works.</li>
    <li> I used this for an itchy scalp issue and it totally helped within a couple uses but the smell! Oh man! It reeks! I had to douse my hair with deep conditioner and lavender oil to get rid of it! I say use this stuff if you have skin issues as it does help but be prepared and have an air freshener nearby plus a natural fragrant oil!</li>
    <li> Odor is overwhelming.  Might be a good product, but didn&#x27;t get past the smell.  You wouldn&#x27;t want to be around people after application.</li>
    <li> This product is everything that Dr. Oz said it was.  It is awesome!  I think everyone should have this product in their house! Fast shipping and well worth the money!!!     Thanks a bunch!!</li>
    <li> I bought into the hype that this was somehow different (or better) than tea tree oil. I&#x27;ve used the product for a week and have experienced none of the miraculous fungus (ringworm) healing that many have claimed. Could have saved money and stuck with tea tree oil since the results in my case were the same</li>
    <li> This manuka oil is amazing! This is my second bottle from this company and not only is the price affordable, but the quality is top notch. This is my hg for acne. It reduces red, angry, inflammed pimples overnight and clears small ones in a day or two. The smell is very, very strong, but for results like that I can deal with it. I am also an esthetician and have access to so many different products, but I prefer to use this for breakouts due to it&#x27;s instant results, and the fact that it is all natural.</li>

The oil is amazingly effective at treating these problems; I had results in less than 12 hours! It&#x27;s got a strong medicinal smell but for results like these who cares? If you find direct application of the oil too strong for some reason, you can try diluting it by placing just a few drops in a little water and/or witch hazel, mixing, and then dabbing it on the area to be treated with a clean cloth.

    <li> Used this oil, didn&#x27;t work, still have the toenail fungus infection.  Thought I&#x27;d add some perspective.  Doesn&#x27;t work in every case,  I wonder how often it doesn&#x27;t work?</li>
    <li> The 100% Pure Manuka Oil was exactly as described &amp; it works great. Delivery was prompt&amp; I look forward to doing business with them in the future.</li>
    <li> I have had a skin rash for over two years and nothing was clearing the issue. I had been to several skin doctors with no success. The rash was speading each time I shaved. I ordered the Manuka Oil and after a few the days the rash was over 50% reduced.  I was so amzed. I continued to use the product and the rash is disappearing. I have ordered more and will always use this as a part of my skin routine. I was absoultely shocked to get these results. It was a shot in dark that definitely hit the mark. WOW    Ruffus L Stokes  Phialdelphia, Pa</li>
    <li> I bought this product not knowing what it&#x27;s potential was! I gave it to my sister in law because my niece had a ringworm. They had been using an anti fungal for about about 3 weeks. I gave her the manuka oil and the ringworm was gone in about a week! I&#x27;m a true believer.</li>
    <li> Manuka oil cured my toenail fungus &amp; restored my toenails so fast I was truly amazed. It actually dried up the loosened fungal part of the nails, which then cracked off. I continued using twice a day &amp; the soft tissue hardened very quickly into what seemed to be new healthy nails. I was able to paint them just like nails. I used the oil over the paint &amp; achieved a complete cure. I also cured a staph infection &amp; a wart with the oil. The wart took quite a while, but it did go. I had tried over the counter medicine for the wart without success, so I was very pleased. It has helped arthritis in my finger joints as well. I highly recommend Manuka Oil, and I believe everyone should keep a bottle of it around for various purposes.</li>
    <li> If you are a parent of young children battling MRSA, then I HIGHLY recommend this product! My 3.5 year old twins have MRSA and we have been on round after round of sulfa-based antibiotics, and the infection keeps returning. I will not claim that Manuka Oil &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; MRSA, but it most definitely helps heal the nasty boils that are a symptom of this nasty infection. I will continue buying this product, and the service from Harmonic Skin Tones is excellent.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!  Used for cystic acne and it worked!  Only downside is it smells bad so only use at night.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff - my son had recurring acne and we used ProActiv plus a prescription medication prescribed by a dermatologist.  Neither was working, but Manuka Oil definitely does - we&#x27;re on our third bottle now.</li>
    <li> This product is everything we expected and more...I bought this to help with my husbands nails, as his toenails have been discolored and heavily ridged for years. We saw a marked difference before the third day of use (applying morning and evening each day) with lightening of his nails and the splitting of his nails has not progressed. This is absolutely amazing stuff! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The manuka oil from this company used to have a powerful&lt;br /&gt;scent, almost overwhelming - which I liked. It came in&lt;br /&gt;the blue-label bottles as pictured at the top of the page.&lt;br /&gt;The last two bottles I ordered came in white labelled bottles (same company,&lt;br /&gt;same label wording, 100%, etc.) and you can barely smell it. Seems&lt;br /&gt;denatured somehow.</li>
    <li> nice ad&lt;br /&gt;Used it up&lt;br /&gt;didnt get rid of my problem</li>
    <li> This ia a great product! It works very well for fungus and dry skin. I have acrylic nails and I mix this oil with solar oil and apply to my nails at night. I have no fungus or cuticle problems. I have used tea tree oil but this oil has a much better aroma. It does not smell like medicine. It has worked well for every pupose that I have used it for!!</li>
    <li> The purity and excellence of the Manuka Oil from Harmonic Skin Tones is unsurpassed!  I have ordered from this company for years and never been disappointed.  It is always packed so well that there is never any breakage or leakage of the oils.  And the shipping is beyond fast!  I love this company and these oils.</li>
    <li> I ordered it, but not impressed..smelled like and felt like an ordinary plant oil..I had thr impression it was diluted with other cheap plant oil. ..</li>
    <li> Medicinal/peculiar aroma (some may or may not like). Good for useful purposes.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Definitly should try this. I have had this problem since I was a seven years old. Finally something works.</li>
    <li> Nice oil.  Just wish the bottle was bigger!  It works on cases of jock itch!  I believe it would on any fungal related skin problem.  The seller is great.</li>
    <li> While I had heard this oil was great for treating skin fungus, it didn&#x27;t help at all that I could tell.  The smell is ok, but a bit medicine-like.</li>
