      <li>Love this color!</li>
      <li>I love this color!</li>
      <li>Love this color!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with my first self-manicure.</li>
      <li>I got comments on how nice it looked.</li>
      <li>so this gives me a nice hint of color and, of course, the strength from the gel.  </li>
      <li>I love it because it leaves a great polished look without attracting too much attention, so it&#x27;s great for work.</li>
      <li>Love love love this gel polish!  </li>
      <li>However, don&#x27;t do more than 2 coats of it or it will peel off/bubble underneath very easy.  </li>
      <li>It would be perfect for a French manicure, however.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also perfect for a french manicure.</li>
      <li>Love the OPI products.  </li>
      <li>Would return the product if I was able to.</li>
      <li>It also didn&#x27;t stay on for more than 5 days.</li>
      <li>Would be perfect for french.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I recommend it over Shellac.  </li>
      <li>I guess the benefit of that is that you won&#x27;t be able to tell if it</li>
      <li>The best with a hint of pink.</li>
      <li>and it is a perfect shade of light pink.  </li>
      <li>I use a UV light but may upgrade to an LED.</li>
      <li>Great and long lasing</li>
      <li>Definitely a nice classy and light workable color.</li>
      <li>Have found OPI gel colors to be great to get the color effects that I am looking for and the wide choice of colors.</li>
      <li>Good price and neutral color to wear with white tips or not.  </li>
      <li>I am a loyal OPI girl and have been for years.</li>
      <li>Very nice nude pink!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale so it blends in with my skin tone pretty perfectly.</li>
      <li>Love the gel polishes that OPI offers.</li>
      <li>I have a very light complexion and this color is not pink on me at all.  </li>
      <li>I ordered it because I am trying to do my own gel manicure for the first time, and such a light natural color does not show flaws and chips.</li>
      <li>It took a couple extra coats before I was satisfied.</li>
      <li>One coat was very sheer and elegant.  </li>
      <li>This color is nice to wear with a French tip or standalone for a natural look.  </li>
      <li>My nail technician said that these colors typically chip easier than more bold ones.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s actually much more peach than  a light orchid pink, also it&#x27;s not opaque enough.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a light, milky peach or salmon color which is also not a good look.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is high quality gel polish, but the color is VERY neutral.</li>
      <li>the gel in this bottle is old or got too hot or something.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s classy not flashy and works well with any outfit you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
      <li>This is a natural, very light pink color for neutral nails.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty neutral color, less peachy than Samoan Sand and more solid than Bubble Bath by OPI.</li>
      <li>The color was too peachy compared to the the normal OPI color.  </li>
      <li>This would be fine over the white of a french manicure.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>Colors are very soft and no glitter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very very pale pink that is perfect for a french manicure, especially with just one layer.</li>
      <li>Love this as a stand alone or under other sheer colors to build on.</li>
      <li>Its transparent with a hint of natural pink which makes it a nice stand alone color because you can see the lighter part of your natural nail under it giving it an easier quicker french without painting the white on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going on job interviews and this natural finished look is what I need.</li>
      <li>This is my least favorite OPI color that I have encountered.</li>
      <li>This is my go to nail gel when I want a soft, neutral look.  </li>
      <li>I contacted OPI and they told me it was an old batch number.</li>
      <li>This is a very pale shade - which is fine with me, but for those who don&#x27;t want a see-through polish, you might not like it.  </li>
      <li>Light pink, not tan, orange or off pink.</li>
      <li>Passion is a very pale natural pink: ideal for a working professional who needs a subtle but polished look.</li>
      <li>The picture looks like a really pretty opaque pink, but in actuality it&#x27;s a very, very sheer peachy-pink that is almost invisible.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other brands but no problem with these.</li>
      <li>Though it would be more french pink, but it was a darker pink and after a few days it looked like a granny color.</li>
      <li>The OPI brand doesn&#x27;t peel and actually  lasts as long as the gel nail polished used when I go to a professional manicurist.</li>

<li> In fact, &amp;#34;Passion&amp;#34; was so similar to my natural nail color that I could hardly tell the difference between one of my nails that had regular clear polish and another nail that had this polish.  </li>
<li> , that definitely lacked any sort of pink hue.  </li>
<li> Not too pink, not yellow.</li>
<li> This color is not as pink as it appears in the photo.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t even look pink</li>
<li> Color not right compared to other lots I&#x27;ve used at nail salon, very peachy, should be subtle nude pink.</li>
<li> It lasts longer than all other gels,  It doesn&#x27;t peel and stays on for weeks.  </li>
<li> Has a pale pink tone.  </li>
<li> and i&#x27;ll be getting other colors soon!</li>
<li> However, I did notice that the brush was slightly bent.</li>
<li> So bummed, when I received this product it was dried and chunky in the bottle.</li>
<li> The color of the bottle is definitely not accurate.</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> I put on 3 coats and it hardly  shows.  </li>
<li> The color barely shows, I am very disappointed with the product!!!!</li>
<li> Something is definitely wrong</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got nothing bad to say about the product itself.  </li>
<li> It was slightly annoying.</li>

    <li> Good price and neutral color to wear with white tips or not.  Has a pale pink tone.  Not too pink, not yellow.</li>
    <li> Love this color! I have gotten so many compliments on my nails!</li>
    <li> Love the OPI products.  I don&#x27;t like nail polish so this gives me a nice hint of color and, of course, the strength from the gel.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this gel nail polish is the best on the market. I have tried others that peel off within a couple days. The OPI brand doesn&#x27;t peel and actually  lasts as long as the gel nail polished used when I go to a professional manicurist. I am very pleased and recommend OPI gel color!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I recommend it over Shellac.  Shellac tends to peel in a relatively short period of time.  I can wear my OPI for 3 weeks before I start getting peeling around the tips.</li>
    <li> Love the gel polishes that OPI offers. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other brands but no problem with these. I use a UV light but may upgrade to an LED.</li>

    <li> Passion is a very pale natural pink: ideal for a working professional who needs a subtle but polished look. It&#x27;s also perfect for a french manicure. I ordered it because I am trying to do my own gel manicure for the first time, and such a light natural color does not show flaws and chips. I am very happy with my first self-manicure. It took three coats to be opaque, but two would work for a French manicure. I&#x27;m going on job interviews and this natural finished look is what I need. if you want color, Passion is not the shade for you.</li>
    <li> Used one coat of this over my french manicure. Very nice nude pink!</li>
    <li> the gel in this bottle is old or got too hot or something.  It has a yellow orange tint to it.  Something is definitely wrong</li>
    <li> Have found OPI gel colors to be great to get the color effects that I am looking for and the wide choice of colors.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish isn&#x27;t what I thought I was getting. Though it would be more french pink, but it was a darker pink and after a few days it looked like a granny color.</li>
    <li> This is a very pale shade - which is fine with me, but for those who don&#x27;t want a see-through polish, you might not like it.  It stays on for a couple of weeks - I like it.</li>
    <li> I like the quality but it&#x27;s actually much more peach than  a light orchid pink, also it&#x27;s not opaque enough.  This would be fine over the white of a french manicure.</li>
    <li> I bought the salamon color thinking that was nude - it is too orange for me - I bought this and it is a perfect shade of light pink.  Would be perfect for french.</li>
    <li> Love love love this gel polish!  This is a natural, very light pink color for neutral nails.  My manicure looks wonderful! And it lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> The perfect neutral for me. Light pink, not tan, orange or off pink. Love this as a stand alone or under other sheer colors to build on. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great color! It&#x27;s a very very pale pink that is perfect for a french manicure, especially with just one layer. I&#x27;m pretty pale so it blends in with my skin tone pretty perfectly.

    <li> Color not right compared to other lots I&#x27;ve used at nail salon, very peachy, should be subtle nude pink. I contacted OPI and they told me it was an old batch number. Threw it in garbage.</li>
    <li> It took a couple extra coats before I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> Definitely a nice classy and light workable color. Can wear with anything! Great and long lasing</li>
