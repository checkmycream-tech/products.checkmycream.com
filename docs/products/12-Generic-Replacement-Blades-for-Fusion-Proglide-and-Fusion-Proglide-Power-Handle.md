      <li>If you were buying and were used to the Gillette name brand blades; don&#x27;t buy these blades.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette blades seem to give a nice close shave &amp; the precision blade on the back side of the head is very useful for harder spots.&lt;br</li>

      <li>This is a pretty classic &amp;</li>

      <li>I now use something exactly like it on fb, the blades last me over a week, where as these lasted me once, maybe twice.  </li>
      <li>After trying 5 of the generic new blades I ordered the real fusion blades.</li>
      <li>Dulls out after one use, first I tried lasted around 3 but after that has lasted one</li>
      <li>had a hard time getting 2 clean shaves from one unit</li>
      <li>Generic blades get dull quicker than the actual Fusion, but not bad for the cost.</li>

    <li> I.. sadly used these for about three years and never really thought much about the negative reviews. They worked well enough. Then, I turned off my amazon subscription (I had a number of blades that hadn&#x27;t been used) and when I re-subscribed to the actual blades I was blown away by the difference. These are MUCH less sharp and last about half as long as the regular blades. This is a pretty classic &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; ordeal.</li>
    <li> an excellent product and a smart buy</li>
    <li> The generic blades work just as good as regular pricy Fusion Gillette blades.</li>
    <li> Dulls out after one use, first I tried lasted around 3 but after that has lasted one</li>
    <li> they dont last as long as the originals but you still save money</li>
    <li> I was afraid these might not work because they were generic and they did not say POWER on packaging. No need to be afraid! they work wonderfully on my power razor</li>
    <li> I was very please with my order and will order more later.</li>
    <li> very dull it seems, if i remember when i bought the original in the store they were great.  Because I bought these, I will never use this system again.  I now use something exactly like it on fb, the blades last me over a week, where as these lasted me once, maybe twice.  R these seconds?or rejected?and that is how they make money by selling on net?if so does the manufacture know it cost them a continued sale with their customers?Just had a hard time getting 2 clean shaves from one unit</li>
    <li> not bad for generic &amp; good price</li>
    <li> If you are used to/like a really close shave; don&#x27;t buy these blades. If you were buying and were used to the Gillette name brand blades; don&#x27;t buy these blades.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette blades seem to give a nice close shave &amp; the precision blade on the back side of the head is very useful for harder spots.&lt;br /&gt;These blades will cut the hair short, but not anything like a close shave, and if u are used to using the precision blade on the back of the Gillette blades, then stay away from these.</li>
    <li> Generic blades get dull quicker than the actual Fusion, but not bad for the cost. I would not purchase them again though</li>
    <li> The blades will not cut a heavy beard. It&#x27;s like plucking out a hair at a time. Worst saving experience of my life. After trying 5 of the generic new blades I ordered the real fusion blades. Night and day difference. In fact my 2 month used fusion still saved me better than a bran new generic.</li>
    <li> These cartridges have lasted me longer than the name brand ones I purchase from the store. I will always buy the generic from now on.</li>
    <li> Simply put they suck. Had to throw them out.</li>
    <li> Great way to purchase the razors affordably.</li>
    <li> Amazing blades, work very well. They last longer the original Fusion blades.</li>
    <li> The worst blade I have ever tried to shave with. The blade I inserted in my Fusion was duller than the one I took out that had been used for over 2 weeks. I could never recommend these blades to anyone. It was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> they were just just what I expected</li>
    <li> Great, great deal. Can&#x27;t go wrong here. Best deal around. Buy these here while you can.</li>
    <li> I have used generics before that worked almost as good as the real thing. These blades are not of that quality. Blades are dull. Tend to tug and pull even on light beard.Trim blade on back is too short, so have to hold blade at awkward angle to get to work. Cheaper per unit, but not cheaper per use.</li>
    <li> THESE BLADES ARE HORRIBLE!!!  I WOULD&#x27;VE DONE BETTER SHAVING WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE.  DON&#x27;T WASTER YOUR MONEY ON GENERIC BLADES!!!</li>
    <li> Not even close to the real thing.</li>
    <li> gets the job done... but doesnt feel as sharp as original.. tends to pull a little when you have a little bit of stuble..  Saved 10 Bucks... Think I&#x27;d rather get the real thing.. much smoother.</li>
    <li> blades came on the dull side.  they still get the job done, but you&#x27;re likely to cut yourself.  i&#x27;ll pay the extra couple bucks for official blades next time.</li>
    <li> these blades are not worth the money. You can get a better quality blade at the 99 cent store. Save your face and spend the extra buck appeice for the Gilette blades.</li>
    <li> Very poor blade. It pulls on my beard, does not work as the actual blades at all.</li>
    <li> Item did not perform as expected. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Just as good as name brand and half the price!</li>
