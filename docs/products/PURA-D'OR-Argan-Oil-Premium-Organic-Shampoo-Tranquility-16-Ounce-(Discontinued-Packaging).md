<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not a miracle shampoo (but I don&#x27;t know if such a thing exists, either).  However, I must say that it appears to have stabilized my thinning hair on one side of my head (started a few years ago for unknown reasons), and it stopped my wife&#x27;s hair loss.  My wife stopped using it only because she didn&#x27;t like the way it dries out her hair - she says even her hairdresser noticed that it makes my wife&#x27;s hair &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; looking.  I still use it as my daily shampoo - definitely a keeper until if/when I find something better.</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle, and very clean product. The aromas were subtle and the foamy suds tingled slightly on my scalp. Washed out easily without any residue and left my hair clean and soft.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of very high quality Korean shampoos and while I LIKE THEM A LOT, probably more than this shampoo, the fact that this is all organic makes me feel good about putting it on, and by default in, my body and also about buying it and about supporting the organic industry in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo today and used it for the first time. It is gentle, mild, clean, plus no strong fragrance. I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner after this shampoo and my hair is soft and shiny. I really love this shampoo. Thank you for the great product.</li>
    <li> I love how light this is and how it feels on my head.  I love how it makes my hair feel.  There is a significant healthier glow and my hair is softer.  And no oily residue in my hair.  No harsh odors, no harsh chemicals.  What more could I ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the name...Tranquility.  That is how the soft scent makes me feel.  Hopefully this is doing all it promised and my mind isn&#x27;t playing tricks on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my daughters seem to love the changes and have started sneaking it away to use for themselves.  They think I don&#x27;t know.  Silly girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to have to purchase some for them now too.</li>
    <li> Perfect product! Help me to solve my hair problems</li>
    <li> I woke up this morning and was shocked by how soft, smooth and shiny my hair was.&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of hair but it is thin so I tend to shy away from shampoos with oils in fear of it flattening my hair or making it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;But this.... WOW. I love love love it! Seriously. and the best part is that it has no parabens and harmful chemicals. 100 % recommend. I&#x27;ve found the one!</li>
    <li> I was looking for Shampoo without sodium lauryl sulfate (neither any similar ingredients). Although some brand is titled &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34;, only part of their ingredients are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m glad that I found Pura d&#x27;or. Its ingredients show authentic free of sulfate.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good organic shampoo, it exceeded my expectations, most of the components are organic and it keeps my hair in good shape, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years now, which is testament enough. I like it much more than the high-end &amp;#34;salon only&amp;#34; brands - love the way it smells, love how my hair feels after using, and really love the fact that it&#x27;s made without SLS! I have long(ish) grey hair, and I credit Pura D&#x27;or products with keeping it soft instead of wiry like grey hair can get.</li>
    <li> My first bottle is about gone and I love it! It has honestly lessened the hair coming out onto my brush and seems to make my hair fuller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural shampoo option for a long time but was hesitant to purchase because I thought they wouldn&#x27;t perform like &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; shampoos... but this one has been great for my toddler and I with very fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t foam up quite as much as regular shampoos but the result is fantastic! No residue just soft hair and I feel much better about using a product without unnecessary chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this incesable shampoo for the past few weeks. It smells great and after one wash my hair felt fuller and looked great. Most of all I noticed less shedding!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo on a different account and i hated it. It didnt do anything for my hair. It made it feel frizzy for me:( it did not make my hair soft and i do not recommend this product. I expected better</li>
    <li> I truly tried this, first time around gave it one start, then I kept trying it again and revised my opinion to 3 star, however, after a week or so, I can say for sure my hair is straw like. First of all if you have thin, dry, frizzy hair THIS IS NOT FOR YOU, why? you ask? because it contains tee tree oil, super dry for already dry hair, and if on top of that you have thin hair  like I do you are making your already dry hair even drier.  I bought instead The Honest Shampoo and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware of all the 5 star reviews, they seem fake.</li>
    <li> Overall is good but a little too dry for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME product! It has a great pump on it too.</li>
    <li> Never buying cheap shampoo again. People were asking me if I got a hair cut because it looked so much better. Also noticed my dandruff went away.</li>
    <li> Good smell, good texture. A little drying but does not cause my scalp irritation and keeps my loss and psoriasis at bay. I will keep using.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo on the market!&lt;br /&gt;All natural and it leaves my hair smooth and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;I tried today for the first time and I am very impresse.&lt;br /&gt;I love the conditioner and the a few of the other Pura D&#x27;or products.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the serum on my face for a few days and I already see a difference!</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle of Argon Oil from your company. I feel it is a wonderful moisturizer for my skin and will continue to use it. So far, I really like the product and would like another bottle. Thank you for your offer, Denise</li>
    <li> Finally I found something that helps my thin hair look thicker without using rinses, gels, etc.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo works the best for my baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great my hair use to be limp and thin now .&lt;br /&gt;It is shiny and is start feel like it has some body. I will order more when it runs out, a dear friend of mine recommended to me and she steered me I. The right direction.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the lather, but not sure if this has helped with volume. have only used 1 time! Mia Barnhart</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo as it smells good, works up a great lather and have not had any kind of a allergic reaction. Will definitely purchase this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> AMAZING REALLY LEAVES MY HAIR SOFT AND SILKY!!&lt;br /&gt;would ABSOLUTELY RECCOMEND IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an organic natural product line. Went &#x27;no poo&#x27; 9 months ago with a shampoo bar but it just left my hair so dry. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d find a product as &#x27;clean&#x27; as a shampoo bar but this line is pretty darn close. Bought the premium organic shampoo and conditioner and so glad I did! Hair has a ton of body, not weighed down (I have fine hair) and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like regular shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using argan oil. I read the reviews on Amazon and chose Pura D&#x27;or Argan due to the positive results and good value. I am so happy I decided to try it! I received my bottle on a Sunday afternoon. I had a bad dry spot on my thumb from a reaction to a soap and washing my hands..I tried it on the spot and by today, Wednesday, it is almost completely healed. This is amazing! I also started using it on my face and I already see changes in my pores and complexion..my skin is visibly changing for the better..and my neck! It is not oily and absorbs well and quickly. There is no detectable smell and you do not need to use much to dab on your face. I also have used what is left over on my hands,after applying on my face, to the ends of my hair..again, a noticeable healthy difference! This is truly liquid gold! Anything that can show a difference after 3 days is fabulous in my book!  Please do not hesitate to try Pura D &#x27;or Argan oil...you will not be disappointed. This is a miracle in a bottle!!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Every time I step in the shower and wash my hair, I end up with literally anywhere from 40 to 50 strands of hair on my palms. However, after using this shampoo, paired with Nizoral and Minoxidil, I noticed that the number of strands of hair on my palms have significantly diminished to about 10-15. I dunno if it&#x27;s just one product or the combination of the three but I&#x27;m going to keep this regimen as it seems to have slowed down the balding process. Man...balding sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****I realized I bought the wrong shampoo after I had opened the box and just gave it to my wife to use. She has not used it yet. This review is for the hair loss prevention shampoo. ******</li>
    <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner together for about a month. My hair didn&#x27;t thicken or grow faster. I actually lost more hair. My drain &amp; brushes had more hair clumps in it than usual so I stopped using it. Didn&#x27;t even finish the bottles up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it worked for some people but not me.</li>
    <li> Very nice cleans well probably could use their condition but not nearly as much hair loss and easier to comb out</li>
    <li> Amazing Product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this shampoo and happy to write a positive review of it.  My body is chemically sensitive but I have experienced no harmful effects from it.  It is thick and sudsy and lasts a long time.  My hair has responded nicely to it too.</li>
    <li> This product is the best organic shampoo I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> I read review after review looking for the right shampoo for my long and thick black hair.  My hair goes down to my butt and is only washed once a week.  It&#x27;s very healthy but sensitive to crappy products.  I bought this and had very high expectations...  Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to suds up when I wash it the first time each showering (does that make sense?).  I basically soak my hair in water then add shampoo.  I&#x27;m pretty sure we all do this, right?  First time, there are NO bubbles... that&#x27;s annoying.  Then I rinse and repeat. Now this is so weird.  The second time I shampoo, you&#x27;d think I washed my hair with dish detergent.  The bubbles are fantastic!!  Basically, I love this shampoo but wished I could figure out why it&#x27;s not bubbling up the first time.  Maybe it&#x27;s my hair... Maybe it&#x27;s my method.  Who knows?!  But either way, this works.  So my suggestion, if you decide to buy this shampoo is to wash your hair twice.  (IF needed)  It cleans my hair, smells amazing and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems aside from that.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. No frizzies the hair strands feel stronger. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month. I feel like there&#x27;s no build up</li>
    <li> Quick E Shop delivered this order in a very timely matter.  The shampoo Pura D&#x27;or Premium Organic shampoo is an excellent shampoo that leaves my hair clean and manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and I don&#x27;t think I will be changing shampoo for a while. It&#x27;s not going to work magic and help you grow hair, but I do notice less hair in the drain, which is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> This is not my first time using this shampoo.  Since I began last year my hair is healthier and no longer fall out like it did. I will continue to purchase this shampoo and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A great shampoo that has much less water than any shampoo you can buy at the store. The last bottle I got lasted over a year!</li>
    <li> Good product and seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days &amp; haven&#x27;t really noticed much change in my hair, but I think (hope!) it&#x27;s a cumulative thing. I&#x27;ll post in another 10 days or so</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil even though it&#x27;s just my second day using it my face look so smooth and I love the feel of it I sure I will buy more!! Thank you I&#x27;m glad I tried this!!!!! The next time I buy I will take picture before and after!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like regular shampoo/conditioner but it does a great job. If you&#x27;re not used to using organic shampoo/conditioner this will feel weird to you at first. Don&#x27;t overuse it....give yourself a week or two for your hair to adjust. I use 3 pumps of each and I have long greasy hair. Let it soak in for a few minutes for best result.</li>
    <li> The first thing I&#x27;d like to say is that this shampoo is not just for woman! I am a man that enjoys using this shampoo. Now that we&#x27;ve got that out of the way I love that I can actually pronounce, read, and understand the entire list of ingredients (and the name of the shampoo) on every bottle! I never have to worry that there&#x27;s some type of secret ingredient that this company is hiding from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the product, the product is great. It makes my hair shine (which my the ladies really like) and it smells good. The only problem I have and the reason I gave it a 4 is because it does seem to make my head flake which has never been the case when using other products, but I still believe the pros outweigh the cons and will continue to use this product because of the lack of harmful chemicals in it. I definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday maybe twice a week, I like it but I&#x27;m still trying it out.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo! It smells pleasant (without having too strong of a scent) and it keeps hair clean even for an every other day washer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - my hair, which is apt to be very dry through colour treatment, is in great condition since using this shampoo - very highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to work but I think you have to continue use.  I think you should also take vitamins while using.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  It doesn&#x27;t lather like your typical shampoo but wow what a difference!!!!!! My hair is so healthy now and it&#x27;s growing faster than normal.</li>
    <li> I have to say, after using this shampoo my hair has never felt better. Before it was dull and frizzy now it just feels like a million bucks. I recommend this to anybody with dry and frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I happened onto it from Groupon a few years back. It cleans your hair thoroughly. The price has since gone up on many sites. This was the best price I have found. Shipped and received very quickly. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This&#x27;s the 3 bottles I used, first of the premium gold label. When it&#x27;s ranked on the top of Amazon rating it&#x27;s hard to not attractive by it. It&#x27;s texture soft you can feel your hairs thicken and stronger when you use it in a right time, so I&#x27;m sure it(or Argan oil) has a good level of hair protection fuction to some degree. However, hair loss prevention is a complex mechanism, requiring more than just a shampooing process, I believe you will feel better if taking care of your food/body mechanism at the same time. Overall judging sorely on this item, it&#x27;s not a bad hair protection product if you can afford the price.</li>
    <li> I expected so much more for this shampoo because of the price. I know better shampoo that costs less than half of this.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I am an asian with black thick hair.</li>
    <li> I just start using this product for a week and seeing a great result so far..So I think i will keep on using this great product to stop my hair loss.Thank you ver much for changing my life..Five stars rating.</li>
    <li> Have only used for a few days and the condition and look of my hair has improved noticeably.  I prefer natural products and also use henna for coloring and the shampoo brightened my hair to add luster to the color.  Feels and looks thicker, expensive, but willing to try it for the 3 months, will report back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this organic shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and my hair is always being complemented by my colleagues.The only down side is it makes your hair a little dry but definitely worth it. Just make sure to use oil to moisturized your hair ( I use Argan oil). If you want to regrow your hair without using any harsh chemicals, USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo over the past month now.  I like the volume and shine it brings to my hair, including making it a little less wavey.  I&#x27;m starting to order other of their product lines.</li>
    <li> Showed results just after a couple uses.  Solid product.</li>
    <li> Great service and product</li>
    <li> The shampoo cleans hair without harshness and hair is shiny. Did not need conditioner. I did not used this products conditioner. It has been about two weeks with this shampoo and it is a gentle and natural product and I hope it does not change.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. My wife likes it because it moistens her hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels good I doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or dry the hair. I would buy it again. I can&#x27;t really say I have noticed anything fantastic.</li>
    <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> I have used other Argan oils before purador is by far the very the very best oil.  The fragrance is very light and the oil is absolutely my favorite yet, it gets absorbed in to my skin with out feeling oily.I will purchase this again great for my skin and I get compliments on how shinny my hair all the time.</li>
    <li> It lathers real good, feels very conditioned. My hair feels and looks like hair again, very shiney and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 58 year old woman who recently became concerned by the perception my hair was thinning.  I researched products on line and the Pura d&#x27;or product line was rated as highly effective in combating hair loss.  From the first time I used the product, I was impressed by the quick lathering, pleasant fragrance and appearance of my hair after drying.  I also purchased the Argan Oil and Premium Organic Conditioner.  After a few weeks, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and, whether my hair was thinning or not, these products are a permanent part of my regimen.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo.  Good customer service.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair coated like other shampoos.  Now only if I had a good head of hair :0)</li>
    <li> I suffered hair-losing problems and always want to find some product to help me to solve this problem.Then I found this one.  is very good to use at first try. Hope to see significant effect in long time.</li>
    <li> Smells good and my hair looks good.</li>
    <li> Great choice! I have thin hair and when I use this I have a feeling that my hair looks shinier and smoother. I am not sure about the body because my hair is short but I think that also depends on your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product!</li>
    <li> I have been looking to replace my favorite shampoo (Pureology) and I am so glad I found this one. It is made of natural, organic ingredients (a rarity!), it smells amazing, and most importantly my hair looks and feels great! I am really happy with the ingredients as it is very hard to find a shampoo that works great without damaging my hair color (this shampoo does not have any sulfates or other harsh chemicals). I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product but the pump wouldn&#x27;t work along with the conditioner bought. It&#x27;s frustrating to use.</li>
    <li> Great smell, leaves hair lovely and silky soft. I use a little argan oil on the ends of my hair before I start blow drying and it looks really smooth after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now and I enjoy the rich lather that it gives in addition to the smell.  I&#x27;m not sure in regards to my hair loss, however, I&#x27;m not saying it hasn&#x27;t worked or not.  I will continue to use this product for a while.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and have seen great results with next to no hair in my brush. Before using Pura d&#x27;or shampoo there would be 10+ hair in my brush after showering, my wife has also seen an improvement with almost zero hair in her brush, we both noticed that her hair is fuller/has more body than before. I&#x27;m speculating that its the Argan Oil along with the better ingredients that they use.&lt;br /&gt;We give it a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, M and S</li>
    <li> My wide use to be a huge shampoo snob and thought the only good shampoos came in litre size and at her salon, until I turned her on to this gem. What I like best about this product is the refreshing feel my hair feels afterwards. Both my wife and I use this product. It&#x27;s perfect on all hair types. We love that it&#x27;s truly all natural!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product, but has a different smell thay I can&#x27;t realy describe.  Will finish this bottle, then decide.  So far ok.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, felt the difference from the first wash. helps a lot for people lacking volume in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;For those suffering with hair loss, especially due to DHT build up this product is a must, got all the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;to help thicken and nourish hair as well as strengthen roots, however be patient with it, leave it on for 2-5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;and wash for best results, been using every 2 days in shower and can&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;yet to find a product out there that is as effective, highly recommend</li>
    <li> I was looking for a great shampoo that was natural and didn&#x27;t contain any sodium chloride. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean. It also doesn&#x27;t lather that well and I have to use a lot of it. I am not that happy with it. I am making my husband use it up since he doesn&#x27;t care what shampoo he uses and I have already switched to another one that works much better.</li>
    <li> I am so glad using this product. The deliver service is fast and secure. I had terrible hair lost and tried several types of shampoos  in hope to cure it but they did not work until I got this product. The product quality is high comparing with all other shampoo I have used thus far.  With its dense, I just use  a little amount for each wash I think it is worth its prices. I will continue to consume this product for my future.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo because it is organic. I am trying to eliminate as much toxic chemicals as possible from my life. This shampoo does the job, after washing my hair with it my hair is clean and shiny. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo because it says 99% chemical free.  I started having allergic reactions with regular shampoos and conditioners (I used to be OK with those in the past), and needed to switch to something chemical free. I know this is not 100% natural, but I gave it a try since I don&#x27;t see 100% natural product on the market, and this shampoo has good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is not creamy and my hair doesn&#x27;t get moisturized  (I guess this is because much less chemicals included),  but it does a job. The smell is not strong and nice.  I have not allergic reactions, too, which is most important for me. I would recommend those who are looking for non or less chemical shampoos.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Tranquility shampoo is the second product I have purchased from the company. I am happy that the ingredients are natural. My hair tends to be dry at the ends and awhile ago I found that using a little pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil on clean wet hair was a great moisturizer. The stuff is expensive though so now I reserve it only for my face. I decided to give this shampoo a go since argan oil is one of the ingredients. The lavender scent is lovely, I just wish it was stronger. After rinsing I can barely detect any scent at all. The instructions say to work into a rich lather (yes, this SLS free shampoo lathers quite nicely!), let it soak in for two minutes, then rinse. My hair looks great and feels soft after using. I went through one 16 oz. bottle in just about three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used Burt&#x27;s Bees Very Volumizing Pomegranate shampoo and found that the pura d&#x27;or product is far superior. I use less of the Tranquility shampoo per washing compared to Burt&#x27;s Bees and it definitely cleanses better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with the Tranquility shampoo but I find the cost prohibitive. I probably won&#x27;t purchase this item again but will continue trying other natural shampoos.</li>
    <li> The shipping was on time and the products were received in very good condition. The shampoo smells good and I can&#x27;t wait to use it...very happy about the purchase so far.</li>
    <li> Love this product !!!!it&#x27;s one of the best shampoo I absolutely recommend for a good value &amp; quality .</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076Q7WH0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I have thick but very fine hair that needs to be washed often. It cleans my hair without stripping away the oils and leaving my hair dry. This is the third product I have used from this company and I really like them all. I will say that I have stopped using the argon oil I purchased from them on my hair because I no longer need it when using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have just purchased my second bottle of this stuff. Personally, I think it helps a lot. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle to happen overnight, but if you want to give your hair an overload of healthiness without harsh chemicals, this is the shampoo for you. I went from using head and shoulders to this, and I would never go back</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and I&#x27;m always trying new products. I was interested to see if this product would help my hair grow since I will need a haircut soon. So far it has left my hair soft and moisturized. My hair was thinning on the top of my head at an alarmingly fast rate but after using this shampoo for seven weeks my hair looks amazing, its thicker, the thinness on top had filled in I no longer have to use other stuffs. This shampoo makes your hair grow fast too! It can be drying (great for oil hair!) so a good conditioner is a must. When I say, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t live without Pura d&#x27;or&amp;#34;, I mean it! Before starting with Pura d&#x27;or, running my fingers through my hair was anxiety provoking because it meant ending up with a handful of hair. My bathroom floor collected an alarming amount of hair over the course of 24 hours and my husband would comment that after I showered I left behind &amp;#34;terrifying hair spiders&amp;#34;. My widening part and thinning hair were a constant source of stress. Since beginning with Pura d&#x27;or, there has been a noticeable reduction in the volume of hair loss and increase in the fullness! I have very sensitive skin, and find most products are irritating. Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s natural ingredients were perfect for me! I wish I could give Pura d&#x27;or more than 5 stars! You deserve this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo.It smells nice and has a good texture(?). I will purchase it again. I like the organic ingredients...</li>
    <li> Cleans fantastic.  I use a pea size amount and I am amazed how well it cleans. My hair was breaking and dry from standard shampoos. I switched to WEN conditioner cleanser eight years ago. Wen products are very expensive and require a large handful applied twice to clean. I now use Pura d&#x27;or  organic shampoo and rub a pea size amount of Pura d&#x27;or argon oil in after every wash. Getting the argon oil rubbed into my wet hair is magic.</li>
    <li> Loved using this product.  Made my hair feel clean and refreshed and liked knowing that the product is cruelty free and contained organic ingredients.  It&#x27;s one of the best hair shampoos I have come across in a long time.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo، but keep my hair a little dry</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps natural oils in the hair. Hair does not feel like washed out wool after use but rather rejuvenated and chemical-free.</li>
    <li> Outstanding stuff -- cleans gently but thoroughly and love the smell!  Also love that it&#x27;s made as sustainably as possible.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it head to toe. Not to greasy and a small bit goes a long way. When the need arises, I also mix essential in for what ails my skin or hair.</li>
    <li> nice shampoo, very thick lather.</li>
    <li> I bought my first, but will be my LAST bottle of &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Shampoo: Tranquility&amp;#34;.  Yeah, I too was suckered in by all the glowing reviews, but most reviews were bribed with promises of free or discounted product.  Betcha❗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe not all of them but certainly a sufficient number to mislead  a casual shopper.  I fell prey and even joined the choir with my own five-star review but only recently recalled having down so -- ah, like over two years have passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am herewith making corrections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCAMpoo anyone❓&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill B Asucker . . 🤢💨 . . 🐜</li>
    <li> Loved this product! really helped get my hair back to a healthy state after bleaching it and dying it for years!</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo. It cleans well and my hair feels clean but not dry. It does not irritate the scalp. It has a pleasant light herbal scent that is not overpowering or cloying.</li>
    <li> helps keep my hair soft and adds a natural golden shine to my hair</li>
    <li> Just got this a couple of days ago. Have used it once and so far, my hair feels great. Not sure about the new growth yet. Will update after a month. 6/7/15-still not quite a month, but so far my is much more manageable. Haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth, but I like the way it has tamed my hair&#x27;s &amp;#34;frizzy mess&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It is so amazing. I love it and will buy it again definitely!</li>
    <li> What a great unisex shampoo, perfect complement to the Argan oil conditioner.  Leaves you hair clean and not greasy, and not with an overpowering feminine perfume smell.  And it&#x27;s organic, a big plus  Good for the entire family.</li>
    <li> i think that this shampoo is excellent. It leaves hair clean without stripping it.Your hair also stays clean for three days.I see less hair loss when I shampoo and would get this again and I would also try the hair loss one too. I already use the purador argan oil for my face and like this too. A very good product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! My hair was falling out abnormally fast when I was using just a grocery store brand. I decided to purchase this and it was a vast difference. After I wash my hair, my scalp feels soothed, tingly, fresh and clean. I also happen to love the smell of tea tree oil, so that was a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give 4 stars, because while I am unsure whether it really causes regrowth, it definitely has limited my hair loss and I love the clean, revitalized feel and look of my hair after each shower. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I  have hard-to-manage thick hair and this shampoo has helped tame the wildness that can happen when I don&#x27;t use the best products.  The scent is light and not over powering, and my hair feels clean and soft after use.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has coarse, thick or hard-to-manage hair.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. Hair fall has reduced comparatively. But when the bottle comes to an end, the shampoo does not give the best result as it does usually. But still like this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well.  I did not know for sometime that I had Type 2 diabetes and was losing my hair like crazy at that time .  It helped then and when I started to treat my diabetes it has definitely helped my hair thicken.</li>
    <li> Noticed healthier hair in just a few tries. I would suggest this too anyone for anyone looking for healthier hair using organic shampoo.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo. Been using this for approximately one year and see a huge different from the shampoo i used before. A much more natural approach for more natural thickness.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner!  I&#x27;ve used it just about two weeks now, and my hair looks and feels healthier, and very shiny.  It Also feels thicker and fuller.  I&#x27;m also noticing much less fall out.  Smells great too!  Try it.  I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Thankyou!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shampoos that I have used. I really love the scent of it. However, the smell is not strong and does not linger throughout the day, which is very important to me since I get migraines from strong scents. I notice that when I&#x27;m rinsing it out, it makes a sort of squeaking sound. I&#x27;m not sure if this is good or bad. It feels like it conditions my hair slightly as well, especially since it says to leave in for at least 2 minutes before rinsing. I have issues with head pimples with some shampoos if they don&#x27;t clean well enough and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues. My hair is a little tangled after rinsing it out, but the conditioner seems to remedy that.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, has stopped my scalp from itching, my hair is easier to manage now.</li>
    <li> A small amount goes a long way. It leaves behind no residue and always leaves my hair shiny and clean. The only downside is if you use too much it will dry your hair and make it frizz a bit-- easy fix though, just use a small amount.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, will reorder.</li>
    <li> I just start using this product for more than 2 weeks and seeing a great result so far..So I think I will keep on using this great product to stop my hair loss. I started promoting this product to a friend..i will give a 5 stars rating for this product</li>
    <li> Miracle shampoo. Its make my hair thick and shiny. Higly recommended this product..</li>
    <li> Nice texture not filmy like a lot of shampoos. More soothing to scalp than most.</li>
    <li> The main reason I like to use Amazon is that I can decide which product to buy based on the reviews. However, several companies have started taking advantage of that. I&#x27;ve received discounted or even free products before from sites like AMZreviewtrader, and you ALWAYS have to put at the end of your review that you received that product at a discount/for free in exchange for your honest review. If you don&#x27;t, Amazon will pull that review because they can see that you paid only $2 or $3 for the product instead of full retail value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was naturally a bit suspicious when I saw that some products by pura d&#x27;or have thousands of positive reviews. So I bought this shampoo, thinking maybe the reviewers were right. Now, I have nothing against the shampoo itself. It&#x27;s made of natural ingredients and it cleans my hair. It dries the heck out of my scalp so I had to slather on layers of conditioner afterwards, but most natural shampoos do that to my hair so it&#x27;s nothing unexpected. But I have a real problem with the marketing strategy of Pura d&#x27;Or. If you look at the review page of their products, you&#x27;ll see hundreds of reviews that have the same story pattern, and left by reviewers that have only that review under their account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through 2 month worth of reviews for the argan oil conditioner (that&#x27;s 18 pages of review, that&#x27;s how angry I was), and I lost count but there were at least 3-5 reviews a day that were bogus. They all had very similar stories:&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;m a *insert job title*, so my look is very important for my job&lt;br /&gt;2) I started losing hair/bald spot&lt;br /&gt;3) My friend/doctor referred this product to me&lt;br /&gt;4) The hair loss stopped after 1 month of use!&lt;br /&gt;5) Miracle/unbelievable&lt;br /&gt;I actually saw a couple reviews that used the exact same wording. And every couple weeks or so, they would come up with new stories like how their hair was unmanageable (instead of hair loss) but became so silky after using this product and yadiyadah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, I know these reviews are bogus because I clicked on each name and saw that the reviewer left only ONE review, and it&#x27;s the Pura d&#x27;Or product review. Sure, it&#x27;s possible that some reviewers loved this product so much that they decided to leave the first ever product review. But all of them? And anyone that left a review that&#x27;s less than 3 stars have at least 4 or 5 unhelpful votes. Some of them really weren&#x27;t helpful reviews, others were talking about how their hair got all tangled after using the product and were quite helpful, but they got negative votes anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything screamed BS. The story templates, the fake reviewers, the down-voting of reviewers that didn&#x27;t love their product...shame on you, Pura d&#x27;Or. If this isn&#x27;t against Amazon policy, I don&#x27;t know what is. All I can do is report abuse to Amazon, vote the bogus reviews as unhelpful, and leave this review to let the buyers know. Maybe I&#x27;ll get so many negative votes that you&#x27;ll never see this review. But I can certainly try! It&#x27;s sad that you can&#x27;t trust reviews on Amazon anymore. This is really just an average product, and it&#x27;s certainly not so amazing that it deserves thousands of positive reviews (this one only has a couple hundreds, but it has its fair share of bogus reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not work for any company. Like I said, I receive free/discounted products from time to time, but they&#x27;re usually from different companies. All I was required to do in return was leave a review, doesn&#x27;t have to be a positive one. You can check my profile and you&#x27;ll know I&#x27;ve reviewed different brands of beauty products. I&#x27;m not paid by anyone to slam pura d&#x27;or, I just feel like people should know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The 3 stars are for the product itself, which is only average. If I could leave a separate review for Pura d&#x27;or, I would. But the seller is Amazon, so I can&#x27;t really give them a rating.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, I know these reviews are bogus because I clicked on each name and saw that the reviewer left only ONE review, and it&#x27;s the Pura d&#x27;Or product review.

    <li> Feels good! my skin was refreshed after I used it</li>
    <li> its really good for growing hair</li>
    <li> This product is great. Don&#x27;t need much for my hair so not much wasting. I&#x27;m used to using the conventional stuff like hand and shoulders and i can feel the differ... after using this product, i can feel my hair being smoother and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;While it is a bit more expensive, i think its worth it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product for about three months now and I could see a very good result. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I have struggled for a really long time to find a shampoo that will help curb the intense itchy and pain I experience during the dry winter months. After some research, I decided to try this one. It seems to have just the right blend of tea tree oil to keep the pain and itchy at bay. I have used a variety of organic and &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products, but none of them really seemed to help. I am really glad I found this one. It smells great and lathers well too.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo.  My hair feels softer and thicker.  Will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo! My head does not feel oil, and my hair loss has decreased</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will continue using this one!</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo after reading several positive reviews and after using my 3rd bottle, I&#x27;m ordering my 4th bottle now. I use to have hair all over my tub after showering, but after using this shampoo I began to noticing fewer strands of hair in my tub. It&#x27;s an expensive shampoo but a little of it goes a long way.</li>
