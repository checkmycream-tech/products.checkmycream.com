      <li>Excellent.  </li>
      <li>a beautiful scent!!!</li>
      <li>The Best the World Has to Offer&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Very happy Memories for my wife and myself...</li>
      <li>if you love floral scents this is the perfume for you!!!</li>
      <li>Wonderful to find it online for her, and at a good price, too.</li>
      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>This will go great with the dusting powder.</li>
      <li>She has been wearing it for years, and very happy we were able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and she loved it as well.  </li>
      <li>Delivered on time and exactly as described, this is an excellent deal.</li>
      <li>... Was so pleased to find  this, I bought 3!</li>
      <li>Nice to find a site I trust to buy it from..</li>
      <li>The first is acrid chemical smells more on the line of fly spray.</li>
      <li>This was for my mother and she love&#x27;s it.</li>
      <li>Be sure it&#x27;s not just the top that has the Evyan tradematk; make sure it&#x27;s on the bottle too.</li>
      <li>I just love this cologne scent.  </li>
      <li>Love it, my favorite scent</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming or too fruity like some scents out there.  </li>
      <li>Nothing smells better than just clean.</li>
      <li>For people who don&#x27;t like strong perfumes, this is the one.</li>
      <li>They have substituted cheap ingredients and turned it into a cheap drugstore product.</li>
      <li>Timeless, light floral scent.  </li>
      <li>So please,  try this; you are going to love it, and what&#x27;s more, I think you&#x27;ll find yourself recommending this just as much as I do.</li>
      <li>so I was excited to find this parfum spray.</li>
      <li>The original White Shoulders that I wore in my younger days was made by Evyan, and it was beautiful and long-lasting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to drench myself in it just to get an hour&#x27;s worth of staying power out of it.</li>
      <li>I know exactly what White Shoulders smells like and these two bottles must have been sitting on a warm shelf for years.  </li>
      <li>Such a fresh, innocent pure fragrance that reminds me of a time in life before I became jaded and world-weary.</li>
      <li>I was sure that it would last longer on my skin than the cologne.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>we were married 50 year ago in August of the year 1963.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>However if one was to use an alluring scent there can be nothing better than a classically proven one.</li>
      <li>I have loved White Shoulders since wearing it the first time in the mid 1970&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Very highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The spray bottle type is very convenient.  </li>
      <li>It has a very feminine fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t get heavier as you wear it.  </li>
      <li>I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops.</li>
      <li>Eau de Toilette is easier to find, but  fades quickly, doesn&#x27;t last the way the Eau de Parfum does.</li>
      <li>A timeless classic that&#x27;s been in my family for three generations. ...  </li>
      <li>The cologne is lovely but does not last long at all on the skin</li>
      <li>The second (including White Shoulders) is natural scents in this case more in the line of flowers.</li>
      <li>I ended up throwing both bottles away because I was too busy to return them.</li>
      <li>My mother has worn White Shoulders all her life, a lovely, light fragrance like wildflowers, but the Eau de Parfum version is increasingly difficult to find in stores.</li>
      <li>I love White Shoulders and the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; mixture has a slightly sweeter and longer lasting fragrance that the &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; .  </li>
      <li>For mature people it brings back memories; for the young it creates them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With the plethora of scents reinventing them selves each year, this is one of the few that are immediately recognizable.</li>
      <li>Granted, this is really not expensive but it was still a waste of money.</li>

<li> You can find the real thing on Ebay for about $10/oz for cologne, which is not too bad considering I found a 2.25 oz  in original box</li>
<li> I have asthma and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problems for me, as some other perfumes do.</li>
<li> Acrid, harsh, with no staying power.</li>
<li> I grew up with it and its delicate allusions to hyacinths and gardenias.  </li>
<li> And the parfum scent is really not as nice as the scent of the cologne, so I may as well have just bought the cologne for less money.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t hate it and it works nicely in tandem with my Elizabeth Taylor Gardenia Spray cologne, but I am disappointed with its overall quality.</li>
<li> My Esposa loves this, been a staple for the past 47 years</li>
<li> The perfume has a subtle fragrance and is not overpowering.</li>
<li> The eau de parfum was old, rank and musty smelling.  </li>
<li> I just gotta figure out how to get rid of the 2 bottles of crap I bought before I got my education on White Shoulders.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money; you will be disappointed.</li>
<li> Always seem to find the cologne but have had a difficult time finding Eau De Parfum</li>

    <li> Been wearing White Shoulders since 1972 ... Always seem to find the cologne but have had a difficult time finding Eau De Parfum ... Was so pleased to find  this, I bought 3! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very happy Memories for my wife and myself...we were married 50 year ago in August of the year 1963.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> a beautiful scent!!! if you love floral scents this is the perfume for you!!! you will definitely be noticed !!!</li>
    <li> Timeless, light floral scent.  Very highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the White Shoulders product your mother/grandmother used. The original White Shoulders that I wore in my younger days was made by Evyan, and it was beautiful and long-lasting. Evyan went out of business in the 80&#x27;s I believe, and the name White Shoulders was bought by Elizabeth Arden (EA Fragrances) and Perfumes Intl. They have substituted cheap ingredients and turned it into a cheap drugstore product. Acrid, harsh, with no staying power. Don&#x27;t waste your money; you will be disappointed. Learn from my experience. I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops. There is also powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy unless you see the cursive Evyan signature, a cursive &#x27;E&#x27;, or the trademark phrase &#x27;The Best the World Has to Offer&#x27;. You can find the real thing on Ebay for about $10/oz for cologne, which is not too bad considering I found a 2.25 oz  in original box w/cellophane with a $15 price sticker. Be sure it&#x27;s not just the top that has the Evyan tradematk; make sure it&#x27;s on the bottle too. There&#x27;s even a market for empties, which I used to just stick in my dresser drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just gotta figure out how to get rid of the 2 bottles of crap I bought before I got my education on White Shoulders. Looks like the Goodwill box for them!</li>
    <li> I have been using White Shoulder perfume forever...Nice to find a site I trust to buy it from..Thank you....Smells great.</li>
    <li> The eau de parfum was old, rank and musty smelling.  I know exactly what White Shoulders smells like and these two bottles must have been sitting on a warm shelf for years.  I had purchased one for myself and one for a friend whose mother always wore White Shoulders.  I ended up throwing both bottles away because I was too busy to return them.</li>
    <li> This perfume is just a beautful fragrance.  I got it for my daughter-in-law and she loved it as well.  It has a very feminine fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t get heavier as you wear it.  I have asthma and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problems for me, as some other perfumes do.</li>
    <li> My mother has worn White Shoulders all her life, a lovely, light fragrance like wildflowers, but the Eau de Parfum version is increasingly difficult to find in stores. Eau de Toilette is easier to find, but  fades quickly, doesn&#x27;t last the way the Eau de Parfum does. Wonderful to find it online for her, and at a good price, too.</li>
    <li> A timeless classic that&#x27;s been in my family for three generations. ...  if you haven&#x27;t tried it,  I recommend giving it a spray.</li>
    <li> Love it, my favorite scent</li>
    <li> Use it a lot one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I just love this cologne scent.  The spray bottle type is very convenient.  This will go great with the dusting powder.</li>
    <li> I bought this fpr a friend.</li>
    <li> I have loved White Shoulders since wearing it the first time in the mid 1970&#x27;s. Such a fresh, innocent pure fragrance that reminds me of a time in life before I became jaded and world-weary. The cologne is lovely but does not last long at all on the skin so I was excited to find this parfum spray. I was sure that it would last longer on my skin than the cologne. It does not! I&#x27;ve had to drench myself in it just to get an hour&#x27;s worth of staying power out of it. And the parfum scent is really not as nice as the scent of the cologne, so I may as well have just bought the cologne for less money. Granted, this is really not expensive but it was still a waste of money. I don&#x27;t hate it and it works nicely in tandem with my Elizabeth Taylor Gardenia Spray cologne, but I am disappointed with its overall quality.</li>
    <li> My grandmother wore only this cologne and parfum.  I grew up with it and its delicate allusions to hyacinths and gardenias.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelming or too fruity like some scents out there.  Everywhere I go, I&#x27;m asked what I&#x27;m wearing and complimented by one person after another. And believe me, I do not apply perfume as if I&#x27;m a crop duster!  So please,  try this; you are going to love it, and what&#x27;s more, I think you&#x27;ll find yourself recommending this just as much as I do. When it comes time to give gifts, this is the gift I give to my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I love White Shoulders and the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; mixture has a slightly sweeter and longer lasting fragrance that the &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; .  Delivered on time and exactly as described, this is an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> Nothing smells better than just clean. However if one was to use an alluring scent there can be nothing better than a classically proven one. With the plethora of scents reinventing them selves each year, this is one of the few that are immediately recognizable. For mature people it brings back memories; for the young it creates them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two camps with it comes to perfume. The first is acrid chemical smells more on the line of fly spray. The second (including White Shoulders) is natural scents in this case more in the line of flowers.</li>
    <li> This was for my mother and she love&#x27;s it. She has been wearing it for years, and very happy we were able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My Esposa loves this, been a staple for the past 47 years</li>
    <li> The perfume has a subtle fragrance and is not overpowering. For people who don&#x27;t like strong perfumes, this is the one.</li>
