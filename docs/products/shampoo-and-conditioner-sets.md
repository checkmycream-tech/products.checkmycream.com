      <li>Absolutely love these.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so nice and smooth and</li>
      <li>I checked the shampoo bottle just to make sure there weren&#x27;t any ingredients I was allergic to, and as I&#x27;m reading the ingredients I see olefin sulfonate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I ordered it</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell, so I switched to my favorite organix conditioner.</li>

    <li> It makes my hair moor thik and shine</li>
    <li> I had been using keratin coppola shampoo with better results, I decided to try another one but with this my hair is frizzy</li>
    <li> Did changed the texture of my hair . I love it! From dry hair to a shiny manageable hair. It did changed my hair .</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase. Would buy again with this seller. Good product worked awesome with my hair. Was looking for sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Great Seller!!! Everything went perfect!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very well and no need to worry about stripping your keratin treatment :). Recommend trying it out.</li>
    <li> My hair felt like straw after using this product. At my local grocery store I was able to find a shampoo and conditioner that left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair silky smooth. I purchased to follow up with a keratin treatment that I also purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT THE BEST PRODUCT I USED ON MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S HAIR</li>
    <li> I just had a keratin treatment done two weeks ago. I was very happy to find a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner set specifically for keratin treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product 3 times. I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell, so I switched to my favorite organix conditioner. After the third time, I was finding that my scalp was getting more and more itchy. I checked the shampoo bottle just to make sure there weren&#x27;t any ingredients I was allergic to, and as I&#x27;m reading the ingredients I see olefin sulfonate. While technically not a sulfate, hair care professionals caution that olefin sulfonate can be just as damaging as any sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty upset to find out that the $25 I spent on this product was a waste.&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that the reason I was so itchy was that over the course of three washes I had accumulated a horrific amount of buildup in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to people with keratin treated hair.</li>
    <li> After using the Keratin therapy to defrizz my hair, the shampoo and conditioner work together to ensure that my long hair continues to be straightened absent the very expensive hair straightening jobs I had earlier.  Be careful to cover your eyes well with swimming goggles as the therapy liquid has a pungent odor and irritated my eyes.  Try these products for an earlier get up and go look.</li>
    <li> Great for your hair, love the way it makes my hair feel.  Best when used with the keratin treatment from the same line.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the keratin treatment and it is amazing!!! I have frizzy curly hair and all of these products together really fight the humidity here in Atlanta. It seems a bit pricey at first, but a little goes a looong way. You might spend $70 here, but it is better than $300 in the salon and you can use it repeatedly. I bought the treatment months ago and the bottle is still almost full. If you use the products all together, it will last you well over a year.</li>
    <li> I was super disappointed in this product. It leaves my hair feeling all nasty. I have used other keratin shampoos that are fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent, but these bottles are really small. I got huge bottles of GK when it was on sale, so I&#x27;m waiting for that to roll around. I prefer the smell of GK more also.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! Usually I swap brands but I&#x27;ve used this for quite a few months now.</li>
    <li> the shampoo and conditioner works nicely leaves hair soft , the only complaint is its so thick its hard to get it out of bottle.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these products, I got the most horrible face reaction as a face red burn ... I am really disgust with the shampoo specially.</li>
    <li> Wonderful feeling I&#x27;m glad that I ordered it</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after I had a keratin treatment and it works great.  It&#x27;s very gentle and my hair feels clean and looks shiny afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product will buy again</li>
    <li> are the best maintenance kit with hair with keratin treatment&lt;br /&gt;the clean shampo pretty well&lt;br /&gt;  conditioner performs much&lt;br /&gt;excelent products</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I stumbled upon for my keratene treated hair!!! Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who was having a Keratin treatment and needed a sulfate free shampoo. She says it is wonderful and the price is definetly right.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my hairstylist because i got the keratin treatment done and i love it..</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair just like you see in commercials.  Do you want to feel and look like a model?  Try them.</li>
    <li> This product, is really, I have to say, the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  I put my hair through Brazilian treatments and color. My ends were in terrible condition, dry and frizzy, after using this one time the frizz was 95% gone. This will be my main hair product for a very long time!</li>
    <li> Shampoo was good, but I don&#x27;t felt like the conditioner nourished my hair very well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves my hair super soft!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this shampoo a few times and am very satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> The bottle design is super cheap looking but I REALLY like this product even over more expensive brands. It just works to keep hair soft and able to be styled after getting colored. Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I love it I was using Marcia textura but this I like even more I have very curly hair so I get the keratin express treatments so I need a sulfur free product . I just which they came in bulk size bottles ( larger size bottles ) so I would not have to order as often. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are really nice for my hair ( straight, thin and frizzy). I am impressed. They make is silky and shiny!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  For me, it works better than the recommended products for after care from a Brazilian blowout.  My hair is soft, shiny and manageable.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but it does go a long way.</li>
    <li> It caused my scalp to breakout badly. I stopped using it after about a week and went back to my old shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using a certain brand that my salon recommends when I have my hair Keratin treatment, which has a very attractive scent.  This one does not have it, but it surely delivers double the smooth silky feeling that I am presently using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side for me is that I live in the EU, which makes your order double the price.  Wish you can find a way to ship them to me from the EU, then that would save me the duties that I would need to pay for them.</li>
    <li> I got Keratin Treatment Straightner 2 weeks ago. Hair dresser told me I better should use salfate free shampoo and stuffs.  So I bought Organix shampoo,but it was very so so.  I purchased this shampoo and conditioner because of lots of good reviews.  It&#x27;s very good actually!&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth and light. very shiny as well like what they say.  I was lucky I found and purchased!</li>
    <li> I made this purchase after using a keratin treatment on my hair.  This product is high quality; a little goes a long way.  My hair is thick, coarse &amp; unruly-before keratin treatments.  Therefore, to gain the look of &amp;#34;human&amp;#34; hair I desire, lol, I&#x27;m all about maintaining the keratin treatment as long as possible.  This shampoo &amp; condition is now my go to for maintaining lasting results.  :-)</li>
    <li> It made my hair feel oily and it does not have a beautiful scent to it the way other shampoos do.  But, it does seem to work.  I had the Brazilian Keratin treatment done to my hair, and this shampoo is supporting it nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I like it better than the Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel so hard and the conditioner makes it so soft...soft like crazy, this stuff is good. I use these after the keratin research keratin treatment. Just FYI, that stuff is salon quality as long as you use it as directed!!! I like all these products very much, they have saved me a lot of money in the last year!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this yet.  The smell isn&#x27;t great and I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is getting clean or conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see how my hair does over the next couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these.</li>
    <li> awesome shampoo and condioner</li>
    <li> It gave me Dandruff, super dry-Ish sensation. After third use I regretted this purchase.</li>
    <li> my wife likes it, her hair is totally different, it came also with their keratin product, and the full package was great. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner and shampoo set is absolutely amazing!! It cleanses and moisturizers the hair great and is the recommended set for the Keratin Research keratin treatment regimen!!! I absolutely love this line!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I will recommend 100%</li>
    <li> Make sure you rinse your hair well. At first I really did not like this product because it left my hair feeling heavy and dirty. After using it many times, I gave my head a really good scrub/rinse and I didn&#x27;t have the heavy feeling any more. Great smell too!  I&#x27;m not noticing any difference in the feel of my hair, stronger/shinier, as advertised...but I&#x27;m going to continue using to see if it just takes a while to work.</li>
