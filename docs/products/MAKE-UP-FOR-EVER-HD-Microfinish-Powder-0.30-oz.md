      <li>You don&#x27;t need much and give the illusion of a perfectly applied make up face!</li>
      <li>i was looking for a powder that would set my makeup and give a nice finish</li>
      <li>It has a really nice \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; or \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent to it</li>
      <li>but I did my own makeup for my wedding</li>
      <li>When my skin is clear and I don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage from tinted powders, this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>They were developed and launched in an era for HD TV artists whose skin needs to look poreless and perfect.</li>
      <li>Very Very fine just like the smoke.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most powders and this is the best by far.</li>
      <li>Very light and silky.  </li>
      <li>I love this powder.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you blend it all in.</li>
      <li>and I did a lot of sweating, however this powder on top of my Make Up</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this translucent powder</li>
      <li>guess quality isnt always pricier &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>perfect, especially the quantity and price....</li>
      <li>More like sweaty.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the ELF HD powder and will never again pay $35 for the MUF.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree with her more.  </li>
      <li>The best part is it matches any skin color, the white powder blends in and doesn&#x27;t show up on the skin.</li>
      <li>There is also more product in the ELF container.  </li>
      <li>I thought I looked okay until I saw pictures of myself</li>
      <li>My clients love love them as well.     </li>
      <li>I love it both ways.</li>
      <li>She said that the ELF powder had the same ingredients and was a perfect match for the MUF product.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim because so many people have raved about it.</li>
      <li>, i love there</li>
      <li>I think if you have naturally more oily skin</li>
      <li>This product is truly not for everybody :)     </li>
      <li>I love the effect.  </li>
      <li>Love this powder, however the container it comes in</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love make up forever products.</li>
      <li>ELF also has decent makeup brushes for $3 and great eyeshadow brushes for $1.  </li>
      <li>beautiful finish and leaves skin looking natural</li>
      <li>Because when you dust it on air, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s very fine and light that it creates a smoke like consistency.    </li>
      <li>I find this helps to keep oil at bay and in general, is a good setting powder!</li>
      <li>It helps to control the oil better, makes my skin look even and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to tap your brush to get off excess powder, and lightly brush all over your face.</li>
      <li>But if you are fair skin tone person, then this might not even appear much.</li>
      <li>and once you can see that literally just a few grains will give you that flawless Dewey finish you will love it.</li>
      <li>Just a fine dusting using a dense powder brush over my made up face is all I need.  </li>
      <li>just a fine layer all over will stick and the rest will puff away.  </li>
      <li>very nice,my wife love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely fine, as light as air.</li>
      <li>My T-zone is oily with huge pores that look like orange peel in the makeup mirror.</li>
      <li>Gives a fantastic matte finish to my face.</li>
      <li>ELF also has a website (eyeslipsface.com) and their shipping is free with a $25 purchase.  </li>
      <li>Like the product to smooth out makeup and keep nose from getting shiny.</li>
      <li>Forever is a company I always feel comfortable spending money on since they have always offered quality products.</li>
      <li>i got this a while ago and really loved it, but you can only tell the difference if you pay close attention to detail...which most girls who are into makeup do...</li>
      <li>The right amount of product is sitting on top waiting for my makeup brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this powder three stars because I&#x27;ve found an exact dupe that performs just as well for a fraction of the price!!  </li>
      <li>It is an exact match for MUF!!  </li>
      <li>, it gives a super smooth finish, doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and pores</li>
      <li>This item does not come in the new fabric filter package which I miss just a little bit,but it is the same wonderful MUFA powder so many of us love with good reason.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>It is the final step for makeup that can perfect my face and look natural.</li>
      <li>I agree with all you ladies who have positive comments about this award winning powder.</li>
      <li>My face looks a whole lot better without it.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t leave my bar and put on more BB.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great finishing powder. Light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
    <li> This makeup doesn&#x27;t work that well for me but I still gave it four stars because I think it is mainly my skin type. I have drier skin which can look very flaky when I apply this. If I really go to town on moisturizer, then this powder makes my skin look fantastic by absorbing any extra oil and providing a smooth, even finish. However, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of putting on that much moisturizer. I think if you have naturally more oily skin then this product would work wonders for you if you prefer a matte finish.</li>
    <li> i bought this hd powder with high hopes.. i was looking for a powder that would set my makeup and give a nice finish i mean after all it is called HD.. this did not do anything for my skin it made me look really flaky just nothing of what i was expecting and way too expensive..</li>
    <li> Hello,     I&#x27;ve got this product long time ago, and I have to say this is one of my recommended products. BUT! This product is truly not for everybody :)     First of all, consistency. It&#x27;s extremely fine, as light as air. Because when you dust it on air, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s very fine and light that it creates a smoke like consistency.    Second, color. Alright, so it does say &#x27;translucent&#x27; but it does add a little bit of a layer of color. It will make your skin lighter, obviously because the powder is white. But if you are fair skin tone person, then this might not even appear much. But for me, I am a medium skin tone, it does add a little bit of a lighter color onto my skin. So if you are quite dark, you might want to look for something else. But if you have no problem to look slightly lighter, then go for it. It works amazing.     Third, finishes. Obviously, extremely matte. For a matte lover, oh this is good!     Fourth, skin type. Oily skin, Praise the Lord. This is a gift for oily skin type, as it absorb oils. Dry (flaky) skin, this makes your flake more obvious! Make sure you moisturize from the bottom of your heart, make sure it&#x27;s not flaky or dry. Make sure you&#x27;ve done your dry skin regimen and all, then it should be amazing on you.           Price? I know, not the best out there my friends. But, to me it&#x27;s worth it. My clients love love them as well.     Perfect for photography/photo shoot.        Hope this helps ;)</li>
    <li> This is the first loose powder that I have had that doesn&#x27;t make your skin look powdery pale.   Be sure to tap your brush to get off excess powder, and lightly brush all over your face. My skin texture looked noticeably smoother, while also removing shine.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for setting your makeup, or just using it on it&#x27;s own to create a flawless finish. The white talc does not show up and goes on clear without seeping into fine lines or wrinkles. It also takes away redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want a natural day look make up, I use a little concealer on my dark circles or if I have a blemish, and then I apply a small amount on a face brush and buff it into my face. It really does make my skin look flawless and finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product, but then again, Make Up For Ever rarely makes a bad product! I&#x27;ll buy again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I originally found this product as a sealer for a tattoo concealer, but after too many mixed reviews on the concealer (not same brand), I decided against it.  The reviews on the Microfinish powder, however, pushed me to go ahead and order this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3-4 days now, I am truly impressed with this product.  I use Mac makeup, and thus far, after trying many, many brands, it was the only foundation and powder that worked on my oily, acne prone skin.  This stuff, as a finisher, is even BETTER!  It helps to control the oil better, makes my skin look even and smooth.  I love it!  And even though .35oz seems like so little for the price, it takes very little powder to even out your complexion.  I&#x27;m sure this will last just as long as my Mac powder compact.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> two words, LOVED IT.  But it didn&#x27;t set my Dermablend foundation, with that said, it does its job very well.</li>
    <li> This is a new variation on the superfine powder craze, but this one actually does what it claims to do:  fill in fine lines, minimize pores, and leave a colorless matte finish that perfects your makeup or your bare skin.  A lot of others leave a dry, thick finish that magnifies pores and highlights any rough texture or fluff your skin might have. This one does not.  You don&#x27;t have to do the press/tap/grind into your face motion that others request, either.  A light dusting will do the job, and will last for hours as long as you don&#x27;t do any heavy sweating.  There are no perfumes or dyes to irritate your skin or nose, and a little goes a long way, ensuring your investment lasts a long, long time.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth purchase of Microfinish Powder. I have problem skin. My T-zone is oily with huge pores that look like orange peel in the makeup mirror. The skin around my eyes and cheekbones, however, is dry and &amp;#34;crinkly&amp;#34;. This powder works as well as I expected on the oily areas, but I was pleasantly surprised that it also blends out the fine lines on my cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wear my cream makeup, I finish with this powder to set and blend everything. When I wear powder foundation, I use this first as a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;. I love it both ways. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> i got this a while ago and really loved it, but you can only tell the difference if you pay close attention to detail...which most girls who are into makeup do... i used this for a while up until i got the bare minerals for christmas, i love there finish powder even more!</li>
    <li> The product makes my skin illuminate. Pores look smaller and smoother. Skin feels velvety soft and even outs my skin tone.</li>
    <li> The best powder you&#x27;ll ever use! Makes your skin feel like silk and doesn&#x27;t cake or get yucky at the end of the day or if you sweat, etc. I&#x27;ve tried most powders and this is the best by far. A little goes a long way, so the jar lasts a few months. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t understand what the hype is all about. Unless u wanna inhale talc and silica this powder is a waste of money. My face looks a whole lot better without it. It gets into my eyes when i put it on and gives me this chalky ashy look, not to mention the mess it makes when u open the jar. Thumbs down.</li>
    <li> It is the final step for makeup that can perfect my face and look natural. Maybe a little small but I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because so many people have raved about it. I don&#x27;t mind that I&#x27;m not a raving fan because a little of this goes a long way - which means it will last a long time! It has a really nice \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; or \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent to it and it does not take very much to set your makeup. However, I can&#x27;t really tell how much this helps my makeup, so I&#x27;m not sure how amazing it is. I don&#x27;t have super oily skin, and my makeup does not seem to last longer or set nicer than it would with any other powder.</li>
    <li> This stuff is totally cool, and it definitely mattifies and sets makeup.  The tough part is that it&#x27;s so fine, it won&#x27;t even stay on my brush.  It&#x27;s literally like brushing smoke onto your face and hoping it stays.  I recommend tapping on with a finger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this product for setting my foundation (liquid and mineral powder) because it really does keep down the shine on my oily skin. But it is really expensive so that&#x27;s why I gave it a 3 star and won&#x27;t be buying it again...</li>
    <li> I really like this finishing powder...sets my foundation and co.or and gets me out the door and through my long days at work. There&#x27;s no color to the product and you don&#x27;t need it. It&#x27;s micro-fine and blends so well. Give it a try and while you&#x27;re at it, buy a big fluffy Kabuki brush to apply it. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Silly powder.  I have used this for years. Very light and silky.  I wear with and without makeup. Works great both ways.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Ive been using it for 2 years and I just recently ran out of powder. I&#x27;m going to buy another one of these. It keeps my foundation on and makes me feel flawless! The best part is it matches any skin color, the white powder blends in and doesn&#x27;t show up on the skin. It saved me the trouble of matching a powder with my skin color which normally will end up in me wasting $$$.</li>
    <li> Immed nxt day my face was broke out but also tried new base.. Will have to retry without that base to find out which prod act caused prob... Very expensive for the sm amt u receive..</li>
    <li> This is wonderful powder to set foundation and to create a flawless look.  One day I was sitting across from a friend and she said my skin looked great.  I told her about the powder.  It does create a poreless look.</li>
    <li> I have some of the oiliest skin I know.&lt;br /&gt;I know only about 2 other people I have ever met who might be able to challenge me in the oil film absorption contest (gross I know).&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, being a woman of makeupy ways, I ran across this in my hunts through Sephora out in search of hidden treasures.  My heart skipped a beat when I discovered this!  The answer to my problems!  I quickly purchased a large pot and carried my treasure home.&lt;br /&gt;I quckly discovered that the gorgeous matte finish it gave me only lasted a couple hours and I was back to square one.&lt;br /&gt;(I even wrote a stellar review for it somewhere.. tho I forgot where...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN I discovered Ben Nye Luxury Powder.&lt;br /&gt;Not only was it cheaper, bigger (they come in huge 3.4 oz vats for only 14 smackers), it lasted ALL day.&lt;br /&gt;I have no need for this anymore.  It is collecting dust in one of my makeup drawers (which means my drawer is collecting dust for it lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess quality isnt always pricier &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Powder-wise, this stuff is the ONLY stuff for me.  Sure, it&#x27;s not cheap, but this is a good price for it.  Any other powder settles into fine lines and makes me look far line-ey-er than I do with no make-up on.  This stuff, uniquely, makes me look less like I have fine lines than does wearing nothing at all.  I am sold for life.  I dearly hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> Amazing power. Very Very fine just like the smoke. It&#x27;s unvisibl on ur face but make skin brighter and really disappear your pore immediately. I love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your face look flawless.  You use a tiny bit at a time so this will last a long time.  I love the effect.  I&#x27;m addicted now.  Well worth the price and I&#x27;m very fussy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this powder three stars because I&#x27;ve found an exact dupe that performs just as well for a fraction of the price!!  I used the MUF HD powder for quite some time, purchasing it several times at Sephora for about $35 or thereabout.  It really does blur small imperfections and minimize pores, adding no color to my foundation.  It is practically invisible on the skin and creates a semi matte finish that is quite pretty.  When first applied, this powder can make me look a bit pale, but in a few minutes, it leaves only the faintest trace and no color at all.  It is quite remarkable.  That being said, however, one day I was trolling YouTube videos and came across a well known makeup guru who was reviewing MUF HD Powder and ELF HD powder.  She said that the ELF powder had the same ingredients and was a perfect match for the MUF product.  Best of all, the ELF powder costs $6!!  There is also more product in the ELF container.  So I quickly went out and bought the ELF at Target.  And VIOLA!!  It is an exact match for MUF!!  It does exactly the same thing....the texture and finish are identical.  So I&#x27;m a dedicated ELF user now.  At my local Target (there&#x27;s only one in my town) the ELF HD powder is frequently sold out so I purchased two on Amazon Prime for the same price and free shipping.  Even if I had to pay shipping charges, it would be worth it in order to save $30.  ELF also has a website (eyeslipsface.com) and their shipping is free with a $25 purchase.  There are other great ELF products that I&#x27;ve tried, including the lip exfoliator, makeup setting spray and the HD blush.  ELF also has decent makeup brushes for $3 and great eyeshadow brushes for $1.  So it&#x27;s not hard to rack up the $25 purchase.  I absolutely love the ELF HD powder and will never again pay $35 for the MUF.  While the MUF is a great product, albeit expensive, there&#x27;s hardly any powder in the container so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.  If you&#x27;re considering buying the MUF powder, try the ELF first.  It&#x27;s only 6 bucks so what do you have to lose?t&#x27;s only 6 bucks so what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> Love the feel its smooth and and holds make up in place doesn&#x27;t last as long as Id like needs to be reapplied every fours hrs or so for me since I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> This is basically the loose powder version of Urban Decay&#x27;s photo finish powder. I started buying it when I got sick of UD&#x27;s compacts breaking on me.</li>
    <li> beautiful finish and leaves skin looking natural</li>
    <li> They have changed there powder dispenser which makes you wasting less product.</li>
    <li> Strange at first because its white but I really like it!  Helps to hide flaws.  Your face looks smoother and younger!</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about this setting powder except for it can make your foundation look cakey if you apply too much of the powder. I find this helps to keep oil at bay and in general, is a good setting powder!</li>
    <li> I bought the HD High Definition Powder and conducted an experiment with my sister after the infamous Eva Longoria concealer malfunction - and after my sister put on makeup I took photos of her with makeup WITHOUT the HD powder, and WITH the HD powder. The verdict? HD High Definition powder definitely could be responsible for giving you two white streaks on your face even though in real life you look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the result photo on my blog - just go to the HD Microfinish Product Review.&lt;br /&gt;It shows what happens when you wear the HD powder and take a photo of your face with flash. My recommendation? Use it if you&#x27;re only going to use a little bit, and remember to blend, blend, blend. But then again, why such hassle? I can name at least 10 other powders that does the job and won&#x27;t make you look like you put on makeup in the dark in your photos.</li>
    <li> Gives a fantastic matte finish to my face. I have naturally oily skin but, this product is very good at controlling that for hours. I would highly recommend it as even though it is expensive, a little goes a long way so I know it will last.</li>
    <li> used over sunscreen it controls oil /out using a foundation&lt;br /&gt;one two three four five six seven eight nine ten</li>
    <li> Love this powder! I have very oily skin and this is the only powder that keeps my oil in check all day. Through walking in NYC, subway, office work and after work drinks. A little goes a long way and definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this translucent powder it&#x27;s my favorite.  Just make sure you blend it all in.</li>
    <li> This is the only HD Powder to use!!!!!!!!!!  I will always use this.  It is spendy but does last!  You don&#x27;t need much and give the illusion of a perfectly applied make up face!</li>
    <li> Great turnaround: the product arrived in a week regardless the fact that it was shipped from USA.&lt;br /&gt;Lovely smooth texture. Very powdery! It suits well to normal and dry skins. Extremely neutral in color (does not give you any ghosty look).</li>
    <li> perfect, especially the quantity and price....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 and my skin is relatively fair.&lt;br /&gt;This product works very well, it gives a super smooth finish, doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and pores do seem to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you use too much or don&#x27;t blend well, it can look chalky.  Also, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for medium and darker toned friends.</li>
    <li> All you need to do is take a picture of yourself and you will see that translucent powders are the WORST!  They show up BIG TIME in pictures.  I thought I looked okay until I saw pictures of myself and it looked like someone threw flour at my face.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with Ben Nye Banana powder or with a regular tinted powder.  The best one I have found is Smashbox HD.  I look flawless in every photo.  Never use a translucent powder unless you plan on wiping off your entire face first to ensure you don&#x27;t look like a ghost in pictures.</li>
    <li> Not sure what this was to do but I will stick with my regular compact. Another waist of money.</li>
    <li> First off I should preface this review by mentioning that I am a strait guy that uses this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I also use a BB cream everyday. I find that when I put a drop of this on ( with a makeup brush) after I apply the BB than the BB cream stays on for about 10 hours rather than 5-6.  This is a miracle for me because I am a bartender and I work 8-10 hour shifts, so I really can&#x27;t leave my bar and put on more BB.</li>
    <li> I love this powder.  Normally I would not buy something so pricey but I did my own makeup for my wedding so I splurged.  That day it was 97 degrees and I did a lot of sweating, however this powder on top of my Make Up Forever foundation stayed put.  When my skin is clear and I don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage from tinted powders, this is perfect.  I like that the powder is so fine, it does not leave a heavy powdery look by sticking to the tiny hairs on my face, so it looks especially good up close.  In the summertime I want to avoid a powdery look and this is extremely natural.  I have never noticed that this powder makes me look too white, and I have a medium tan skintone.  It doesn&#x27;t build up if you overapply, just a fine layer all over will stick and the rest will puff away.  I put this on third after my primer and tinted moisturizer, then afterwards I apply some mineral foundation to any areas that need coverage. After lunch or the end of the day if I&#x27;m going out I need to reapply a small amount on my chin and nose, but usually I just use what is leftover on the brush from that morning.</li>
    <li> very nice,my wife love it!</li>
    <li> Love this powder, however the container it comes in is very hard to work with and you lose a lot of powder because of it.  Wish they would come up with a new way to package it.</li>
    <li> I use this over a foundation and it sets it very nicely. It does have a very slight white tint to it but that doesn&#x27;t really affect my coverage because I am slightly pale. I really like the finished look that it gives.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I learned about this product during a production shoot.  The makeup artist on set was raving about how it eliminated shine, but didn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  I couldn&#x27;t agree with her more.  The product is pricey, but I use so little on a daily basis that it is worth is.  I just tip the container upside down, then right side up, and open.  The right amount of product is sitting on top waiting for my makeup brush.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping love the product I will be back again great thank you</li>
    <li> My colleague recommend this to me but I am not impressed with is item at all. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. It does what it supposed to.  But 7 dollar Coty Powder from max factor does the same.  So this will be my lat purchase on this item</li>
    <li> I agree with all you ladies who have positive comments about this award winning powder. I am with you all the way. Just thought you might like to know that this product/this size retails for $34. What&#x27;s with these Amazon sellers who jack up the price of cosmetics?</li>
    <li> Good price. Like the product to smooth out makeup and keep nose from getting shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been using this powder for years and years to set my other makeup and have a smooth finish. This item does not come in the new fabric filter package which I miss just a little bit,but it is the same wonderful MUFA powder so many of us love with good reason. This container is also made a little taller instead of wider which might make it good for travel. But yes, it is the larger size.</li>
    <li> Although this little tub of powder can seem costly, a little goes a LONG WAY, and the results are well worth it.  It puts a final polish on my made up face, and when I&#x27;m in full daylight I&#x27;ve had friends comment about the appearance of my skin.  If you knew my skin, you would know why that is so remarkable.  Just a fine dusting using a dense powder brush over my made up face is all I need.  I touch up throughout the day by first using oil blotting sheets and then dusting another light coat over my face.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why my experience with this product is different from the other reviewers.  I bought this based on reviews!  And it was a pricey mistake.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference when I apply this powder, other than my face seems a little lighter.  I force myself to use it because of how much I paid for it, but when I forget, I don&#x27;t miss it at all.  I am puzzled!  I still have a lot left but when I&#x27;m done with it, I definitely won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love make up forever products. They were developed and launched in an era for HD TV artists whose skin needs to look poreless and perfect. I really wanted it to work. This definitely makes your skin smooth and appear poreless but it doesn&#x27;t really get absorbed so it looks like it just sits on your skin and makes you look \\&quot;white\\&quot; just like the color of the powder.</li>
    <li> I currently use Mac Pro powder and liquid as well as Makeup Forever HD liquid. I also always use a foundation primer. It&#x27;s a must!! Any brand will help but I prefer Mac pro primer or MF HD primer. I have combination skin. Forehead, upper cheeks, lower nose super oily. Between the brows and above the brows very very dry and the top of my nose where it connects to my forehead. My upper lip is dry and my chin is oily. Just a mess. I use a primer to help set the foundation allowing the primer to set into pores, soften up the dry skin riding the flakes, and lay over the pores to fill them for a smooth base for foundation. I use a flat foundation brush to apply foundation I use lighter colors in all my highlight areas and darker in all my contour places then I blend them forward to cover the rest. Without the finish my foundation is wet can be rubbed off, slide around, get onto my clothing, and I look glowing but not always in that positive way. More like sweaty. So I decided to try the finishing powder and you take the lightest amount of product and really swirl your brush into it. Tap off the excess and buff it into your face. A very little of this product goes very far. The tip is to just put a tiny amount into the lid of the jar and swirl that brush and allow each bristle pick up every ounce of powder. Then use what is in there to buff buff buff into your skin. Do not over use the powder it&#x27;s just for a finished look that helps to keep everything in its place. Now when I sweat the foundation stays in place, no more makeup runs on my clothing, no glowing sweaty wet foundation but this beautiful irredecent radiance. If you use cream blush reg blush highlight and browsers you can tend to have too much excess another trick is to take that brush you used for the power and without adding any new powder just lightly buff over the blush and bronzer and now perfection. You have to experiment with just how little this goes and once you can see that literally just a few grains will give you that flawless Dewey finish you will love it. Take it into sephora Ulta or another other counter and they will show you how to use it.</li>
    <li> This powder lasts a long time, as other reviewers have mentioned. It isn&#x27;t necessary to use a lot at a time for it to be effective in battling shine, which is awesome since it is certainly not cheap! I have heard that you can find this same microfinish powder from other retailers at a cheaper rate, but Make Up Forever is a company I always feel comfortable spending money on since they have always offered quality products. If you&#x27;re looking for a finishing powder, this is a great option!</li>
