### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This powder is great!  </li>
      <li>sponge is not the best</li>
      <li>Very happy!!</li>
      <li>Great coverage !</li>
      <li>I went by that, and the color matches my skin perfectly!</li>
      <li>and I felt that Ecco Bella offered the best ingredients at the best pricepoint with organic certifications.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I am very happy with this powder.</li>
      <li>It has great coverage and blends perfectly on my skin.</li>
      <li>It covers any imperfections and blemishes and looks beautiful on.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect for touch ups and covers amazingly well with the applicator included in the compact.</li>
      <li>The coverage is great and it does not irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I already owned (and loved) Ecco Bella lipstick, so</li>
      <li>I did a good bit of research what makeup lines were organic</li>
      <li>and I think Ecco Bella was a good choice for me.</li>
      <li>you are looking for a makeup that will be kind to the earth and your skin, try this.</li>
      <li>Aside from the color, I am just thrilled with the coverage of the makeup and how it looks on my skin.  </li>
      <li>This is the best natural powder I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this line so far.</li>
      <li>It goes on more like a foundation than a powder and was honestly a bit cakey.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this compact power.</li>
      <li>I love this powder.</li>
      <li>I also love the compact, it is still sturdy even though it is a compact you can recycle.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it until I find something better that is non-toxic.</li>
      <li>I know that makeup is very person-specific, but I personally am SO happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Pale&amp;#34; is darker than you would imagine, like many people said.</li>
      <li>Make sure you research your colors</li>
      <li>The color in that listing is much more like the color that I received.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this powder has been great for my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably the best foundation powder I&#x27;ve used, and I also appreciate the fact that I can feel fairly safe about putting it on my face due to its ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I love it, and it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>The packaging looks great, it has an embossed pattern reminiscent of stingray leather that I love.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for myself and did not expect to transition to this type of product so easily.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily</li>
      <li>I could see how if this was not the right color for you, it could leave your skin looking very yellow, as one reviewer said, but for me it happened to be a perfect match.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love this powder, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>The pale color is perfect, more of a light beige and doesn&#x27;t look as light as in the picture.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>but it works fine.</li>
      <li>I have light skin</li>
      <li>I will keep this for winter and order the Light shade.</li>
      <li>However I didn&#x27;t want to buy the chemical filled stuff from the drug store.  </li>
      <li>Good natural foundation</li>
      <li>Pale is the perfect shade</li>
      <li>After ordering my Ecco Bella face powder and applying it, I notice significant improvement just using the face powder.  </li>
      <li>This product has lasted me a long time and its a great quality.</li>
      <li>The Fair seemed to have more of a pink tone.  </li>
      <li>so you get the right color for you!</li>
      <li>This product offers very good coverage although the shade is slightly yellow.</li>
      <li>Luckily for me, it worked for my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I did some research to find the right color, went with the Pale for my light, golden complexion, and while this is a great translucent color, it is still too light...</li>
      <li>So happy to finally have a naturally alternative to my MAC powder.</li>
      <li>I am making the switch to more natural and organic products and this is another step.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other brands that say they are good for acne prone, sensitive, or oily skin with no luck.  </li>
      <li>You can always use the Bronzing powder with it in the summer months - and you&#x27;ll get the right color.</li>
      <li>Powder feels great, I still reapply during the day, but I usually do that with all powders</li>
      <li>Also, I was expecting it to be more of a sheer powder to put over my liquid concealer, but it is very opaque.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin, but usually would never purchase a &amp;#34;Pale&amp;#34; powder.</li>
      <li>Then I learned to just use a little at a time and now I absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>It did cover well, but it certainly looked like I was wearing make-up.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product !</li>
      <li>I love the feel and coverage of this powder which I only need to apply to my nose once - for the entire day.  </li>
      <li>I have been a covergirl classic ivory girl and</li>
      <li>The Ecco Bella powder is  particularly mattifying if you have oil skin.</li>
      <li>pink / orange pigment s. Pale is a great match for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I think the Fair color is probably for fair-skinned people with reddish or pink undertones or just those sorts of people who are very very white-pale, while Pale is for fair-skinned people with peach or even olive undertones who have the type of skin that can hold a tan -</li>
      <li>(I would have normally chosen \\&quot;light,\\&quot; but the \\&quot;pale\\&quot; ended up being the one for me).</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t sit well on my face (not sure why; wish I could share more helpful details).</li>
      <li>It has light coverage but is enough to mask minor flaws.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it, I tried to use the same amount of powder as my old foundation</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s holding up well in my purse</li>
      <li>Its all natural does not sting or burn like some cosmetics I have tried.</li>
      <li>and I think the ingredients are more natural than my other more expensive makeup.  </li>
      <li>It is so dark - definitely not suitable for a fair complexion.  </li>
      <li>I would suggest finding a local store that carries all the colors first and matching your skin tone (then ordering on here if it&#x27;s cheaper), because it&#x27;s really hard to tell from the color descriptions (which are actually a little confusing, in my opinion) or online pictures what would work best for you.  </li>
      <li>It is true that the Pale color has a yellow-ish tone.  </li>
      <li>This one does very well on my skin, I recommend at least trying this brand, it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I like this FlowerColor face powder, it&#x27;s light and does not &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; at all, even after applying a few touch-ups during the day.&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, be careful which color you choose, I have a light olive skin and chose the Pale</li>
      <li>I am a lighter skinned Caucasian (not fair or pale, though, if you ask me) with some redness from acne, and the pale shade works great for me!</li>
      <li>The only upside is it is talc free, but so are many less expensive powders that go on like a powder.</li>
      <li>This pale looks more like the typical &amp;#34;light-medium Beige&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I read the other reviews and ordered PALE instead of LIGHT.  </li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m looking at it, I&#x27;m not sure if I received the right product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This powder is great!  It reminds me of the MAC powder I used to use.  It can go on a little thick, so be careful when applying it.  I&#x27;m sticking with this brand from now on!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this powder has been great for my skin. Its all natural does not sting or burn like some cosmetics I have tried. Great coverage ! I do not even have to wear a foundation and I have blemishes that is covers so well. I have light skin and it also picks up pink / orange pigment s. Pale is a great match for my skin tone. I highly recommend this product !</li>
    <li> I have sensative skin the only other product that worked for me was Josie Marans powder.&lt;br /&gt;That powder is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this one! Hasn&#x27;t broken me out, no smell, not to heavy.. can be builded up if needed. Doesnt feel like I have heavy makeup all over my face.</li>
    <li> It took some getting used to with this power foundation.  A little really goes a long way and I was not expecting that.  The first time I tried it, I tried to use the same amount of powder as my old foundation and I looked like a clown.  Then I learned to just use a little at a time and now I absolutely love it!  And so does my skin!!  I have tried many other brands that say they are good for acne prone, sensitive, or oily skin with no luck.  This one does very well on my skin, I recommend at least trying this brand, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this powder alone, and it has buildable coverage. I was really worried about choosing the wrong color, so I went to the ecco bella website, and it has descriptions for each of the colors. I went by that, and the color matches my skin perfectly! Do not go by just the names of the shades, as they can be misleading (I would have normally chosen \\&quot;light,\\&quot; but the \\&quot;pale\\&quot; ended up being the one for me). I am a lighter skinned Caucasian (not fair or pale, though, if you ask me) with some redness from acne, and the pale shade works great for me!</li>
    <li> When I switched face cream, it cause massive imbalance to my skin.  After ordering my Ecco Bella face powder and applying it, I notice significant improvement just using the face powder.  I am so grateful for all the Ecco Bella products!</li>
    <li> Meh, for the price I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again. It goes on more like a foundation than a powder and was honestly a bit cakey. It did cover well, but it certainly looked like I was wearing make-up. The only upside is it is talc free, but so are many less expensive powders that go on like a powder.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself and did not expect to transition to this type of product so easily.  It goes on easily, however I use a brush, not the pad that comes with it.  And, it stays on all day.  The coverage is great and it does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> This product has lasted me a long time and its a great quality. The &amp;#34;Pale&amp;#34; is darker than you would imagine, like many people said. I have fair skin, but usually would never purchase a &amp;#34;Pale&amp;#34; powder. This pale looks more like the typical &amp;#34;light-medium Beige&amp;#34;. All in all...I love it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this makeup. Unfortunately, the &#x27;Pale&#x27; powder I ordered looks like a cappuccino exploded on my face.  It is so dark - definitely not suitable for a fair complexion.  I am returning it.</li>
    <li> I was using Tarte Amazonian Clay powder, but I am now on a budget and needed to spend a little less on my makeup.  However I didn&#x27;t want to buy the chemical filled stuff from the drug store.  This powder was $15.00 cheaper than my Tarte powder.  I already owned (and loved) Ecco Bella lipstick, so I thought I&#x27;d give the powder a try.  In Tarte, I am &amp;#34;light beige&amp;#34;.  In Ecco Bella, after checking out the colors on the website, I ordered the &amp;#34;pale.&amp;#34;  I have lighter skin, not super white, some pink undertones.  Pale is the perfect shade and I think the ingredients are more natural than my other more expensive makeup.  Yay!</li>
    <li> Love this compact power. I&#x27;ve used this as a foundation over the last two years after experiencing severe skin issued with mineral powder foundations. It has light coverage but is enough to mask minor flaws.</li>
    <li> This product offers very good coverage although the shade is slightly yellow.</li>
    <li> The Ecco Bella powder is  particularly mattifying if you have oil skin. sponge is not the best but it works fine.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. So happy to finally have a naturally alternative to my MAC powder. I read the other reviews and ordered PALE instead of LIGHT.  The pale color is perfect, more of a light beige and doesn&#x27;t look as light as in the picture. I will order PALE again. I also love the compact, it is still sturdy even though it is a compact you can recycle. Powder feels great, I still reapply during the day, but I usually do that with all powders</li>
    <li> I like this FlowerColor face powder, it&#x27;s light and does not &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; at all, even after applying a few touch-ups during the day.&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, be careful which color you choose, I have a light olive skin and chose the Pale and it&#x27;s fine.  You can always use the Bronzing powder with it in the summer months - and you&#x27;ll get the right color.</li>
    <li> I know that makeup is very person-specific, but I personally am SO happy with this product.  I would suggest finding a local store that carries all the colors first and matching your skin tone (then ordering on here if it&#x27;s cheaper), because it&#x27;s really hard to tell from the color descriptions (which are actually a little confusing, in my opinion) or online pictures what would work best for you.  It is true that the Pale color has a yellow-ish tone.  The Fair seemed to have more of a pink tone.  I think the Fair color is probably for fair-skinned people with reddish or pink undertones or just those sorts of people who are very very white-pale, while Pale is for fair-skinned people with peach or even olive undertones who have the type of skin that can hold a tan - but I&#x27;m no makeup expert.  I could see how if this was not the right color for you, it could leave your skin looking very yellow, as one reviewer said, but for me it happened to be a perfect match.  Aside from the color, I am just thrilled with the coverage of the makeup and how it looks on my skin.  It covers any imperfections and blemishes and looks beautiful on.  It&#x27;s probably the best foundation powder I&#x27;ve used, and I also appreciate the fact that I can feel fairly safe about putting it on my face due to its ingredients.  I know it&#x27;s a little pricier than other drugstore products, but for the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; factor and its coverage and match to my skin tone I will continue to buy this from now on.  Very happy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to switch over to all non-toxic make-up, which is difficult to do if you prefer higher quality make-up. I don&#x27;t love this powder, but it&#x27;s not bad. It just doesn&#x27;t sit well on my face (not sure why; wish I could share more helpful details). I will continue to use it until I find something better that is non-toxic.</li>
    <li> I am making the switch to more natural and organic products and this is another step. I have been a covergirl classic ivory girl and this shade works well. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it......a little goes a long way. I use a makeup brush to apply.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural powder I&#x27;ve ever tried! I love it, and it&#x27;s worth every penny! Make sure you research your colors so you get the right color for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a makeup company that I can stand behind for a while now and I think Ecco Bella was a good choice for me. I did a good bit of research what makeup lines were organic and I felt that Ecco Bella offered the best ingredients at the best pricepoint with organic certifications.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the pale shade to match the bisque foundation and I am very happy with this powder. It has great coverage and blends perfectly on my skin. I use it with a brush in the morning and keep it in my purse for reapplying through the day. It is perfect for touch ups and covers amazingly well with the applicator included in the compact. The packaging looks great, it has an embossed pattern reminiscent of stingray leather that I love. So far it&#x27;s holding up well in my purse too!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a makeup that will be kind to the earth and your skin, try this. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this line so far.</li>
    <li> The color was not as expected and not even close to matching the color that it shows on here.  Luckily for me, it worked for my skin tone.  Also, I was expecting it to be more of a sheer powder to put over my liquid concealer, but it is very opaque.  However, I ended up liking it because it works well as a concealer by itself.  Now that I&#x27;m looking at it, I&#x27;m not sure if I received the right product.  This is the item that I received: http://www.amazon.com/Ecco-Bella-FlowerColor-Powder-Light/dp/B000K9E86S/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426641537&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;ecco+bella+face+powder.  The color in that listing is much more like the color that I received.</li>
    <li> Good natural foundation</li>
    <li> I love the feel and coverage of this powder which I only need to apply to my nose once - for the entire day.  Also, love the fact that it is vegan (no lab animals had to suffer to make it or test it), AND it does not contain any nasty talc, or cones.  I did some research to find the right color, went with the Pale for my light, golden complexion, and while this is a great translucent color, it is still too light...I will keep this for winter and order the Light shade.</li>
