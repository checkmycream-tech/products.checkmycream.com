      <li>It was GREAT -</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s also a great value dollar wise.</li>
      <li>I have used this wonderful product for 30 years and love it.</li>
      <li>Smell is good.</li>
      <li>My hair was very healthy when I was using it</li>
      <li>May be it just didn&#x27;t work that effectively on my hair.</li>
      <li>just apply a generous amount (like 2 dollops) to my damp hair, put a plastic cap on my head, wrap it with a warm towel, and chill for around 30 minutes before washing it out.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and it&#x27;s easy to work with.  </li>
      <li>After learning more about conditioners I&#x27;ve also learned that there is nothing in this product that will do anything exceptional for my hair.  </li>
      <li>the price is right to have beautiful hair</li>
      <li>good delivery - this is ok - used to be better</li>
      <li>When I received this I was so excited because I heard so many great things about the Queen Helene products.</li>
      <li>I love this handy pump container.</li>
      <li>I saw this conditioner on a natural hair forum and it received excellent reviews so I decided (being the product junkie I am), that I would give it a try.</li>
      <li>The bottle is HUGE and it&#x27;s so good for hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, too,  for those who use curling irons, and  hot rollers.  </li>
      <li>very smooth purchase as well.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s healthy state.</li>
      <li>I love the cream for conditioning my hair and use it on my hands.</li>
      <li>After shampooing my hair, I rub Queen Helene all through my hair, making sure to massage it into my scalp, and then I make sure the ends are coated.  </li>
      <li>Two things about using this conditioner, it does contain mineral oil and it really is more of a protein treatment than a conditioner.</li>
      <li>I was expecting to get more smoothness and shine as it worked on friend&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>so I know it was for sure this product that made all the difference.</li>
      <li>I left it on overnight which worked best for me.  </li>
      <li>Cracked  on the top with leakage.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>love this.</li>
      <li>Okay...</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;After 2 weeks of using this product, I decided to keep looking for something better.  </li>
      <li>I tried many treatments, the don&#x27;t compare to Queen Helene Cholesterol.</li>
      <li>My conditioning cleansers work much better.</li>
      <li>I really love this product and have finished it and will buy again.  </li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on my hair.  </li>
      <li>IT is okay..</li>
      <li>I had not used this since the 80&#x27;s and was glad to find it online.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product to all family and friends we all use it and love it,.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definately will buy again :-)</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling healthy and smooth.</li>
      <li>I am excited to make this a staple in my home and will for sure be using again.</li>
      <li>I ended up buying 2 other products that I use together, and the results (for me) have been incredible!  </li>
      <li>w/ makes it easy to use.</li>
      <li>At the time my hair was longer and over highlighted.&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- easy pump dispense&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel any great difference in the softness of general health of my hair after using this.</li>
      <li>Love this and will order again, u can use on any hair type no greasy film just very moisturized soft and beautiful results</li>
      <li>It is a huge bottle for 7$</li>
      <li>/&gt;- shouldn&#x27;t leak all over your face while its on (this is why its important to squeeze out water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>It made my hair silky smooth</li>
      <li>The only reason I decided to give it a try was on the advice of my hairdresser who said it is great on damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this works and smells.</li>
      <li>Just a teaspoon of each oil and mix it all together with the conditioner will give you fantastic results.</li>
      <li>and this is a great deep conditioner .</li>
      <li>greatstuff great deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>this was moisturizing it as much as it was, once i returned to my lighter hair, it was not as healthy and broke more often as it started growing out, so i began to look for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>conditioners are one of those things that work differently on different hair types, so I can&#x27;t guarantee that everyone will get as great results as I do, but it&#x27;s an affordable option and worth a try!</li>
      <li>The smell is clean and light.</li>
      <li>I love cholesterol, it really revives my hair from mush to strong.</li>
      <li>Luxuriant and rich.  </li>
      <li>Queen Helene Cholesterol Hair Conditioning Cream Super Conditioner is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is thick and creamy, the pump is the greatest.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is good for deep conditioning treatments.</li>
      <li>It was a larger version and at a good price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now relaxed again and my hair is still healthy thanks to this.</li>
      <li>I purchased this conditioner because I remember using it when I was much younger and loved it..</li>
      <li>Love the pump, it makes using it in the shower so much easier.</li>
      <li>I used this product many years ago when I was in high school.</li>
      <li>Back to healthy hair!</li>
      <li>I liked it then and the formula seems to be still the same</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d take a shower, wash my hair with a gentle shampoo and a cool rinse.</li>
      <li>As I fight heredity and the damaging effects of various products I put on my hair, cholesterol keeps my hair soft ans shiny and most of all healthy.</li>
      <li>This wonderful conditioning cream is so inexpensive and it only takes a little.  </li>
      <li>little bit of this product goes along way and is best used with a cap to retain body heat, and to give it extra boost use a heating cap, or Hair bonnet Dryer or even a heated towel in the dryer will work too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>It has a very thick consistency which is great for my huge head of curly hair.</li>
      <li>I searched further and found a number of positive reviews, and I loved that it was inexpensive versus spending an ungodly amount of money on professional brands.  </li>
      <li>Not only is my hair softer, more hydrated with better texture, but I am finally seeing some repair.  </li>
      <li>It silkens my hair and prepares it well for blow drying and hot combing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This definitely my go to for a wash and go. I also use this product for co washing and I always used a quarter size amount as a leave in. When I started using the product I noticed that after a week or two my shedding stopped and my hair is always much easier to manage afterwards. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Why oh why did they have to change it.  It was GREAT - Now it&#x27;s just Okay...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This word requirement is stupid.&lt;br /&gt;I believe in getting to the point - NOT writing a book!!!</li>
    <li> This is truly an old school hair conditioner. Some of the ingredients I would normally shy away from, but I remember during my childhood, my hair dresser used to use cholesterol conditioner with a hot towel which always kept my thick curly tresses well hydrated and less likely to break</li>
    <li> Well, I now have this big jug of product; and I am quite sure it works for others, it just isn&#x27;t for me. It left some parts of my hair dry. Almost like a protein treatment, and my hair absolutely hates protein treatments. It could have been worse I guess if I didn&#x27;t pre poo my hair first with red palm oil, which makes it very soft. It seems to me that this stuff just stripped all the oil from my hair, therefore leaving  parts of it dry. I guess I&#x27;ll stick to Miss Jessie Rapid Recovery. Oh, I forgot to mention that I used this product with my hair steamer, for my once a month deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> good delivery - this is ok - used to be better I think</li>
    <li> I love cholesterol, it really revives my hair from mush to strong.</li>
    <li> I am a Caucasian, Jewish female with Very Very thick, coarse, dry, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have always Kept it short for this reason, and i usually colored it darker with ammonia free color which until i stopped, i did not realize this was moisturizing it as much as it was, once i returned to my lighter hair, it was not as healthy and broke more often as it started growing out, so i began to look for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;I have an african body type so it does not surprise me that a product targeted towards african hair would work well for me , but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i am taking off one star because it can be difficult for me to wash out of my hair completely, sometimes i have to wash it a couple of times after, but after playing with it a bit , im happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and it has helped calm my hair down.  I left it on overnight which worked best for me.  The smell is pleasant and it&#x27;s easy to work with.  It may be too early to rate this only having used it twice, but so far I have high hopes.  My hair is very dry and crazy, this has helped me tame it into submission.</li>
    <li> This is often in the ethnic aisle at supermarkets, but it&#x27;s for all types of hair. I&#x27;m a white male and it will solve dandruff with one treatment. I once buzzed my hair really short and was dumb enough to spend the entire day out in the sun. My head peeled for days and needed some intense moisture. Cholesterol treated that easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even without dandruff it&#x27;s a great product to add shine.</li>
    <li> Love this and will order again, u can use on any hair type no greasy film just very moisturized soft and beautiful results</li>
    <li> I have used queen Helene products in the past. They really do work. Two things about using this conditioner, it does contain mineral oil and it really is more of a protein treatment than a conditioner. I purchased a separate conditioner for moisturizing my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this extremely moisturizing conditioner. The bottle is HUGE and it&#x27;s so good for hair. My hair was extremely soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I got a perm and the stylist used rods that were too small and left in in too long...basically fried my hair. The stylist I switched to suggested hair cholesterol to help with the damage and neutralizing the chemicals in the curls.  It really does help.</li>
    <li> I have used this wonderful product for 30 years and love it. A hair dresser recommended it to me as being the very best hair conditioner.  I get so many compliments on my hair.  This wonderful conditioning cream is so inexpensive and it only takes a little.  After shampooing my hair, I rub Queen Helene all through my hair, making sure to massage it into my scalp, and then I make sure the ends are coated.  I put on an inexpensive clear plastic shower cap and sit and read for about 30 min. for deep conditioning.  You don&#x27;t have to condition your hair this long, but since I get body wave perms and have my hair colored with permanent hair color, I find that this keeps my hair soft and healthy looking.  I take a smaller container of Queen Helene Hair Conditioning Cream with me to the beauty shop and insist that they use it instead of their conditioners.  This is a great product, too,  for those who use curling irons, and  hot rollers.  I love this handy pump container.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is good for deep conditioning treatments. I used this product many years ago when I was in high school. I liked it then and the formula seems to be still the same so it still remains a go to. It has a very thick consistency which is great for my huge head of curly hair. The scent is not great but it doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair after rinsing. Love the pump, it makes using it in the shower so much easier. It&#x27;s also a great value dollar wise.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before with great results. When i recieved this however, it was clearly opened/ used when I opened the package.</li>
    <li> I use to use Queen Helene Cholesterol when I was really young. My hair was very healthy when I was using it and then I stopped. Since I have stop relaxing my hair I went back to using the cholesterol and now my hair is back to it&#x27;s healthy state. I use it to deep condition my hair. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair black over a full head of super blonde highlights and haven&#x27;t trimmed my hair in two months! I use this twice a week. I put it on my hair, throw on a shower cap and do stuff around the house for 30 minutes. I rinse it out and my hair is so soft and shiney. My hair should look like a rats nest, thanks to cholesterol cream it looks great :) highly recommend - can&#x27;t go wrong for the price - try it</li>
    <li> Smells really bad and left my hair feeling kind of gunky.</li>
    <li> I got this for school. The price is incredible and the size of the bottle is perfect for a beauty school student</li>
    <li> Product Junkie,  and this is a great deep conditioner . I would suggest to anyone. very smooth purchase as well.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this works and smells. I usually add it to my other deep conditoner products and I have no complaints. Heat it up and your hair feels it.</li>
    <li> This product works well for severley damaged hair, I use this product once a week and alternate it with:  Lustrasilk Aloe Vera Cholesterol Super Detangeling Formula for Extremely Damaged Hair - 5 Lb.- 1 Jar, Contents 5 LBS. and my hair is now WOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of this product goes along way and is best used with a cap to retain body heat, and to give it extra boost use a heating cap, or Hair bonnet Dryer or even a heated towel in the dryer will work too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For damaged hair the price is right to have beautiful hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definately will buy again :-)</li>
    <li> great product.  I use and get great results for a cowash.  Sometimes I&#x27;d rather use this than my shampoo.</li>
    <li> IT is okay..Smell is good. I applied it to hair and left it for about 8 mins, then rinsed off. It works ok not very impressing. It is a huge bottle for 7$ so I would say you get a lot for that price. I have Asian Indian straight silky hair. I was expecting to get more smoothness and shine as it worked on friend&#x27;s hair. May be it just didn&#x27;t work that effectively on my hair.</li>
    <li> As I fight heredity and the damaging effects of various products I put on my hair, cholesterol keeps my hair soft ans shiny and most of all healthy.</li>
    <li> I understand that this doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;detangler\\&quot; and promises to condition but it&#x27;s odd that it has zero detangling ability. I tried putting on gobs of it and it doesn&#x27;t help. I don&#x27;t feel any great difference in the softness of general health of my hair after using this. My conditioning cleansers work much better. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> this product is about as old school as you can get.  it&#x27;s still just as great today as it was 60 years ago..</li>
    <li> Noticed a diffrence right away my hair felt so soft!</li>
    <li> Bottle was damaged when I received it.  Cracked  on the top with leakage.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I saw this conditioner on a natural hair forum and it received excellent reviews so I decided (being the product junkie I am), that I would give it a try. I was nervous because I feel that I have finally figured out exactly what does and does&#x27;t work for my hair and I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on a new product especially after I saw someone mention that they changed their formula but the positive results far exceeded the negative. This stuff is great, one of the best features of this is the pump, I love the convenience of that! It made my hair silky smooth (I used this for my deep conditioner) and soft and detangling was a breeze! When I started to straighten my hair it was straighter than ever, and I only made one product change so I know it was for sure this product that made all the difference. I am excited to make this a staple in my home and will for sure be using again.</li>
    <li> I combined this product with Silicon Mix and my scalp got a chemical burn.  I checked out the ingredients and one of the preservatives can cause allergic reactions.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was this product or the other, but not using again.  After learning more about conditioners I&#x27;ve also learned that there is nothing in this product that will do anything exceptional for my hair.  I will not repurchase and threw this purchase away.  I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure if it was this product or not that caused the reaction.</li>
    <li> This conditioning cream is so inexpensive that my initial response was it probably is junk. The only reason I decided to give it a try was on the advice of my hairdresser who said it is great on damaged hair. At the time my hair was longer and over highlighted.&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy. I&#x27;d dampen my hair and apply a generous amount to my hair from roots to end, pop on a shower cap, and read a book for about an hour. I&#x27;d take a shower, wash my hair with a gentle shampoo and a cool rinse. My hair looked healthier and was also shinier without being greasy. An unexpected benefit was that my scalp seemed ultra soft and didn&#x27;t itch or feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have moderated my highlighting and now have healthier shoulder length hair, but still use this once a week and am still reaping the benefits.</li>
    <li> I received this product wow about two months ago or longer.. I really love this product and have finished it and will buy again.  I have AA 4A type hair I am transitioning to natural hair.. I purchased this conditioner because I remember using it when I was much younger and loved it.. It is thick and creamy, the pump is the greatest.  The smell is clean and light. I use this to deep condition and sit under the heating cap.  Always leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I recommend this product to all family and friends we all use it and love it,.,,, NOW I recommend this product to you try it you will love it as a soft protein deep conditioning treatment....&lt;br /&gt;God Bless and have a great day</li>
    <li> Luxuriant and rich.  I had not used this since the 80&#x27;s and was glad to find it online.  Used to come in a smaller tube.  This big tub will last me awhile.  Still a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for decades. It&#x27;s my go to product when I need a deep conditioner. I&#x27;ve used so many different deep conditioners and this one always out-performs them all. I use this weekly and often mix it with other ingredients, such as egg yolk, Indian herbs (henna, amla, etc), and temporary hair color to brighten up my hair color. It mixed well with these, where other conditioners start to separate and look lumpy. It also great as a leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair conditioners are one of those things that work differently on different hair types, so I can&#x27;t guarantee that everyone will get as great results as I do, but it&#x27;s an affordable option and worth a try!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Leaves hair silky.</li>
    <li> I managed to over-color my hair and damaged it beyond belief.  In desperation, I went online and searched for a product that would help rehydrate and repair.  I had never heard of Cholesterol before and stumbled across a post where someone highly recommended it as an extreme intense conditioner.  I searched further and found a number of positive reviews, and I loved that it was inexpensive versus spending an ungodly amount of money on professional brands.  So I decided to give it a try.  I used this product several times a week for a couple of weeks.  To it&#x27;s credit, it did almost immediately help soften my hair.  But it had its limits and after several applications, I didn&#x27;t notice any further improvement.  I needed more than just a little hydration...I needed repair, short of cutting all my hair off and starting over again.  I also had a hard time getting past the smell.  It isn&#x27;t horrible but not exactly pleasant either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of using this product, I decided to keep looking for something better.  I ended up buying 2 other products that I use together, and the results (for me) have been incredible!  Not only is my hair softer, more hydrated with better texture, but I am finally seeing some repair.  I selected L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair Extreme Reconstructing Conditioner, which I use when I shower in the mornings.  I also broke down and spent the money (well worth it) on AG Fast Food Leave-On Condition, which I apply to my hair before bedtime and leave on overnight.  I can&#x27;t say which of these 2 products is giving me the best results.  All I care about is that I&#x27;m finally getting the results I was looking for.  Back to healthy hair!</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my hair feeling healthy and smooth. Have been using this product for years as has my family.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair conditioning Cream. I used this when i went to Cosmetology school years ago and untill now was unable to find this hair cream. I love the cream for conditioning my hair and use it on my hands. wonderful product.</li>
    <li> My relaxed hair was severely damaged, brittle and dry before I started deep conditioning my hair biweekly with this. It left my 4c soft and shiny back when I was natural. I&#x27;m now relaxed again and my hair is still healthy thanks to this. Great for getting rid of split ends, too.&lt;br /&gt;I just apply a generous amount (like 2 dollops) to my damp hair, put a plastic cap on my head, wrap it with a warm towel, and chill for around 30 minutes before washing it out. When I&#x27;m feeling lazy I&#x27;ll do the plastic cap+warm towel method, leave it in overnight, and wash it out in the morning.</li>
    <li> When I received this I was so excited because I heard so many great things about the Queen Helene products. I used it as my deep conditioner and it made my hair so soft. I definitely recommend for transitioning naturals trying to maintain 2 textures.  Packaged very well.</li>
    <li> This stuff costs less than anything else and does a fantastic job. I have used it for years. My hair is coarse and dry and wavy, and this product helps tame it.</li>
    <li> This hair conditioning cream really works for damaged, over processed hair. I leave it on over night when bleaching my hair, which helps to repair and soften my hair.</li>
    <li> Hair type - thicker, curly, medium frizz, non-ethnic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fan of Queen Helene products (mint julep masque was my first face mask as a teen), so I had to give this a try.  I think it is most beneficial for ethnic hair types because after washing it out, there is a little bit of weight that would keep things in check.  I think though that this stuff would be great for people with non-ethnic, dry thick hair, because I&#x27;m in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:  wash hair with shampoo only.  Squeeze out water, towel-dry.  Apply cream (i do this in shower to minimize mess),  Now to get the max effect, you are supposed to put a heating cap on it so it really sinks it.  I don&#x27;t have one, so what I do is put a plastic shower cap over my hair, wrap a towel around it all, blast it with a hair dryer for a bit, and then do some chores for a couple hours ( at least 2), and wash it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- deep conditioning, hair feels incredibly soft&lt;br /&gt;- easy pump dispense&lt;br /&gt;- shouldn&#x27;t leak all over your face while its on (this is why its important to squeeze out water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- takes a bit of effort to wash it out&lt;br /&gt;- can weight down hair if it isn&#x27;t the right thickness</li>
    <li> love this. its a staple for me aand my hair routine.</li>
    <li> recommended by a friend who&#x27;s hair is awesome.  Strong, frizz free and grew like crazy.  I only tried it once, but after the treatment my hair was SO soft.  Can&#x27;t to use it a few more times!</li>
    <li> Queen Helene Cholesterol Hair Conditioning Cream Super Conditioner is fantastic. My hair was very dry and breaking due to over-bleaching my hair. I tried many treatments, the don&#x27;t compare to Queen Helene Cholesterol. It made my dry, damage hair soft, strong silky shiny and no frizz, My hair was easier to detangle when combing when wet. It saved my hair. I highly recommend it for all types of hair that&#x27;s dry, breaking, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used jojoba,coconut,almond,avocado oils mixed together with the Queen Helene Cholesterol Conditioner. Just a teaspoon of each oil and mix it all together with the conditioner will give you fantastic results. It helps to stretch the the conditioner. It all comes up in cost, 50 cents per treatment. and the best treatment on the market.</li>
    <li> I was running low on another Queen Helene condition I used and this popped up.  It was a larger version and at a good price so I decided to order.  I am so glad I did.  It is now the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It even tops WEN by Chas Dean.  It silkens my hair and prepares it well for blow drying and hot combing.  I will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> greatstuff great deep conditioner. The pump this comes w/ makes it easy to use.Love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;If it helps, my hair is long, on the thicker side and color treated. I try to use this deep conditioner a couple times a month</li>
