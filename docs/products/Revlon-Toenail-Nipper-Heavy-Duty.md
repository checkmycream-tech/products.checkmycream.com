### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and they do a great job !  </li>
      <li>The best!</li>
      <li>are the BEST toenail clippers ever.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent Toenail Clipper.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, two for the price of one and being of excellent quality and functionality, I give these my vote.</li>
      <li>These Revlon toenail clippers work wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Works great on my &amp;#34;thickened&amp;#34; toenail.  </li>
      <li>One of them worked great.  </li>
      <li>Amazon was very nice about it.</li>
      <li>good buy</li>
      <li>and it was a good price for two.  </li>
      <li>This is a good deal and the clippers work well.</li>
      <li>We soaked her feet in warm, soapy water for fifteen minutes</li>
      <li>The clippers arrived quickly, in excellent condition, and for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Easy to use too!</li>
      <li>Love these..</li>
      <li>Great tool that make the job much, much easier.  </li>
      <li>In no time at all, she was smiling and feeling much better.</li>
      <li>Also the quality of the Revlon toenail clippers is better, it seems to me.  </li>
      <li>These nippers will not cut my toenails I ordered them hoping they would be better than my clippers, but no dice.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Revlon Nipper for many years</li>
      <li>These clippers are well built and of nice quality, they are definitely heavy duty and work excellent on the most stubborn nail</li>
      <li>I like the hinge, moves easily.</li>
      <li>The clipper is fine, works well, easy to handle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a nice large (made in Germany)</li>
      <li>Far superior to run-of-the-mill clippers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to give this nipper an okay rating only because it&#x27;s a good Revlon brand.</li>
      <li>Really???!!!  </li>
      <li>I have bought toenail clippers of different brands, none were as good as these are.  </li>
      <li>So the item is good, but i don&#x27;t know if my receiving just one was a fluke or a regular occurrence.</li>
      <li>These things are comfortable to hold and easy to use, but the blades lose their sharpness far too quickly.</li>
      <li>These are definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>a million times and ended up losing the right alignment for cutting.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this one, which is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;Boys</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is the best possible heavy duty, professional nail clipper/trimmer</li>
      <li>they are easy to use and especially if you lack strength in your hands.</li>
      <li>I thought this was the large size...</li>
      <li>The seller was very cooperative and gave me a credit without any hassle.</li>
      <li>I am foot and nail nurse and these work very well for me.</li>
      <li>and then I gently proceeded to cut her nails.</li>
      <li>These revlon heavy duty clippers were well- priced and far superior.</li>
      <li>but I like other clippers better</li>
      <li>This is OK, but it requires a lot of strength to use and the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough to make a clean cut.  </li>
      <li>Pleased with this product, easy to maneuver, solid feel, clean and quick cutting clippers.</li>
      <li>First, with the Revlon toenail clippers, the cutting area is a good size and curved just the right amount.  </li>
      <li>I have had a few of other brands that are also great.  </li>
      <li>These were well made: precise and sharp.  </li>
      <li>They have very sharp blades and are easy to use.</li>
      <li>Just be careful when you first start using them because they are very sharp and can easily cut too much if you position incorrectly.  </li>
      <li>I just wanted a new large nail nipper to hopefully last another 30 years.</li>
      <li>They are also very sturdy and will last manyyears.</li>
      <li>My problem with these nippers is they are too small to clip my nails easily and completely.</li>
      <li>They are probably fine for small nails and to clip overgrown</li>
      <li>These other brands bent the toenail to the clippers straight shape, which causes the toenail to tear when you cut it.  </li>
      <li>This two pack is priced exactly the same as a similar single item at my local pharmacy.  </li>

    <li> These nippers will not cut my toenails I ordered them hoping they would be better than my clippers, but no dice.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent Toenail Clipper.  I have had a few of other brands that are also great.  They ranged in the price of US$25.00 to US$35.00.  Nevertheless, two for the price of one and being of excellent quality and functionality, I give these my vote.</li>
    <li> These were cheaper then at WalMart and they do a great job !  Easy to use too!</li>
    <li> Love these.. they are easy to use and especially if you lack strength in your hands. You can get the leverage you need.</li>
    <li> I purchased several types of nail clippers in th i s scissor style before i bought these. They were terrible in that they required extreme force to cut. These revlon heavy duty clippers were well- priced and far superior. They have very sharp blades and are easy to use. They are also very sturdy and will last manyyears.</li>
    <li> To small, should state the size !</li>
    <li> These clippers are well built and of nice quality, they are definitely heavy duty and work excellent on the most stubborn nail</li>
    <li> My mom is elderly and lives with me. We have had a difficult time cutting her toe nails. Her nails had grown too long and very hard. She was afraid to get them cut. We soaked her feet in warm, soapy water for fifteen minutes and then I gently proceeded to cut her nails. These Revlon toenail clippers work wonderfully. In no time at all, she was smiling and feeling much better. I would also like to comment on \\&quot;Health and Beauty\\&quot;. The clippers arrived quickly, in excellent condition, and for a reasonable price. I was afraid that I would have to spend a lot of money that I really couldn&#x27;t spare. These are definitely worth the price. Thank you for helping me out.</li>
    <li> These things are comfortable to hold and easy to use, but the blades lose their sharpness far too quickly. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t found a better option.</li>
    <li> This is OK, but it requires a lot of strength to use and the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough to make a clean cut.  I&#x27;ll probably give up on them and try some with longer handles that come from specialty stores.</li>
    <li> I had a similar Revlon nail clipper for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;It was used and abused for everyone in the family for decades.&lt;br /&gt;Fell a million times and ended up losing the right alignment for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this one, which is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;Boys grew up and are gone. So this one will last me now forever and ever.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best possible heavy duty, professional nail clipper/trimmer&lt;br /&gt;that you will ever find. The best!</li>
    <li> I have bought toenail clippers of different brands, none were as good as these are.  First, with the Revlon toenail clippers, the cutting area is a good size and curved just the right amount.  I have gotten other brands that don&#x27;t have a curved cutting area or the curve is off somehow.  They did a terrible cutting job. These other brands bent the toenail to the clippers straight shape, which causes the toenail to tear when you cut it.  The result from using these other brands is a jagged, rough nail - ugh.  Also the quality of the Revlon toenail clippers is better, it seems to me.  I like the spring.  I like the weight of the clippers. I like the ability of the cutting area to cut.  When I cut the toenail with the Revlon, it is cut through.  With some of the other brands, when I cut, it only goes part way through and I have to keep trying until I can get it through.  With the Revlon, one cut and I&#x27;m through it, without a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;these are the BEST toenail clippers ever.</li>
    <li> These were well made: precise and sharp.  They require less pressure, making it easy to cut tough nails.  Far superior to run-of-the-mill clippers.</li>
    <li> Great tool that make the job much, much easier.  Just be careful when you first start using them because they are very sharp and can easily cut too much if you position incorrectly.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I you have troubling nails that are thick or have sharp corners this nail nipper is for you.</li>
    <li> I read the Amazon reviews, decided it was what I was looking for and it was a good price for two.  Works well and is heavy duty.</li>
    <li> I am foot and nail nurse and these work very well for me.</li>
    <li> good buy but I like other clippers better</li>
    <li> The clipper is fine, works well, easy to handle. I like the hinge, moves easily. I only received one, NOT the &#x27;pack of 2&#x27; as the ad states.&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon and they gave me a choice of return or a partial credit of the missing item. Amazon was very nice about it. I chose the partial refund, which Amazon listed as a &#x27;courtesy refund&#x27;.  So the item is good, but i don&#x27;t know if my receiving just one was a fluke or a regular occurrence.</li>
    <li> Pleased with this product, easy to maneuver, solid feel, clean and quick cutting clippers. I have one travel bag and home.</li>
    <li> This two pack is priced exactly the same as a similar single item at my local pharmacy.  This is a good deal and the clippers work well.</li>
    <li> Really???!!!  TWO?????  Yes, I received two so we keep one in the bathroom and one in the nightstand.  Works great on my &amp;#34;thickened&amp;#34; toenail.  I like the handle lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to give this nipper an okay rating only because it&#x27;s a good Revlon brand. My problem with these nippers is they are too small to clip my nails easily and completely. They are probably fine for small nails and to clip overgrown cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a nice large (made in Germany) Revlon Nipper for many years and it still works okay but it is not as sharp as 30 years ago and the center spring is definitely worn and doesn&#x27;t expand fully anymore. I just wanted a new large nail nipper to hopefully last another 30 years. I thought this was the large size...I was wrong. I will have to look for the larger nippers.</li>
    <li> One of them worked great.  The second one had a manufacturing defect.  The seller was very cooperative and gave me a credit without any hassle.</li>
