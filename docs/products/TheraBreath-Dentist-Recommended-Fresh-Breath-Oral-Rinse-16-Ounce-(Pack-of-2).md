<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a amazing product! A life saver!&lt;br /&gt;It can totally solve the try mouth and odor problem. You can be 100% confident in interviews and dates with it.</li>
    <li> This product keeps your mouth clean and fresh without that burning sensation from other antiseptic mouthwashes. We will be using this product from now on.</li>
    <li> It did what it advertised it would do.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works to freshen your breath. You won&#x27;t wake up with morning breath, either. I&#x27;m giving it three stars instead of two because it does this exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;The taste it leaves in your mouth is similar to the bitter, alkaline aftertaste of an antacid. But it lasts all day and changes the way food tastes. I found it unbearable and stopped using the product after three days. It took another three days for the bitter taste in my mouth to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the thing about relieving dry mouth? Never had an issue with dry mouth except during the short time I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The annoying:&lt;br /&gt;The packaging on this is wasteful, and it&#x27;s designed to make you use more of it than you need. The dosage cup is about an ounce and it&#x27;s just another piece of plastic for a landfill. The instructions tell you to rinse with one &amp;#34;cup-full&amp;#34;, then gargle with another full cup. Twice a day. That&#x27;s four ounces a day from a 16 oz. bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth is, you can freshen your breath using much less than suggested in the instructions. Assuming you don&#x27;t mind the bitter taste it leaves in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Bought these for the hubby after many failed attempts at remedying his bad breath.  He now swears by this mouthwash.  He goes through about 2 bottles a month on average.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> my husband and I were nervous about the taste of this because we&#x27;ve always used the standard mouth washes at the drug store...but this is so mild in taste and leaves you feeling very fresh after! definitely glad it came with two!</li>
    <li> Loved it, took my sore throat (from being dry ) away at night. little pricey but it worked.</li>
    <li> Its really Awesome. I was suffering from tonsil stone for past  so many years. After using this mouth was i feel absolutely no pain in my throat and my tonsil stone are also going slowly and slowly. Thanks to Therabreath . I just love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works -- period.</li>
    <li> The gums around my molars were sore but after using this for about a week the pain went away. Nice, mild flavor without alcohol.</li>
    <li> This rinse works awesome and doesn&#x27;t wear off after 5 minutes of use.  Using with the toothpaste and following the instructions exactly has helped clean my mouth better than what it was.  I am happy with the results and will continue to use product.  I recommended to anyone not feeling freshness.</li>
    <li> See our review of the toothpaste, too - we love these products. We especially love the mild fresh taste - not overwhelming. And it helps drymouth (due to medications).  The rinse is good for a mid-day rinse or two, just to keep your mouth clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for me but I switched back to ACT. I just didn&#x27;t feel or notice any difference from this product and it certainly did not last 12 hours. It may work for others but for me, it was no better or worse than the major name brand products, although more expensive.</li>
    <li> This stuff has ZERO taste and ZERO burn so its great for the kids. In addition, this product does keep your breath from being foul!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about waking up without your breath kicking down the door but it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
    <li> very impressed with this product. when you read hte claims you think it sounds too good to be true. but it really is true. i&#x27;m subscribed to it now. amazing</li>
    <li> After gargling this just two times, I found relief from a sore throat (major problems with tonsil stones) ... not sure if it removed them (mine are large and take a long time to dislodge)... Don&#x27;t like the taste at all, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is amazing.  Four members of my family have had chronic bad breath for years.  They are using it, and it is the only product we&#x27;ve ever found that totally eliminates bad breath.  Easy to use, twice a day, and all the bad breath problems go away!!</li>
    <li> I was one of those people that was convinced toothpaste swished around my mouth did the same job as mouthwash does but I was 100% wrong. I really just could not stand Listerine and how it would burn my gums and make my whole situation worse so I think that is why I decided on that for years. But this mouthwash is amazing and I am so glad I decided to give it a try! It is part of my routine now and my mouth feels polished clean and therefore stays clean longer.!!</li>
    <li> The best i have ever used.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this two times in the morning like the label suggests. I used it once and swished for 1 minute. It worked great and my mouth felt clean and didn&#x27;t have a coated feeling like other mouthwashes leave behind.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I had a mild tingling sensation on my tongue and had occasional bad breath, but once i started using the product, all the symptoms went away.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I have tried.  The only thing that stinks about it (no pun intended) is that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, period.</li>
    <li> Alcohol-based products like Listerine will leave your mouth dry after a few hours-- inviting the bad breath back. Not this stuff. It&#x27;s minty, refreshing, and keeps your breath fresh for hours without that dry mouth feeling.</li>
    <li> Product was great. Shipping was fast. Product really works.</li>
    <li> Pretty effective.  Doesn&#x27;t have the burn of regular mouthwash,  but has a longer lasting fresh feel.  I keep it at work for post lunch use. Bought it on a two for one special.  I would buy one bottle again after using.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels super fresh after using this product!  Will purchase again soon!</li>
    <li> My Daughter has been using this product for over two years, it works wonders and is about the only thing that does.  Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I felt a tingle in my throat which is usually the precursor to a raging sore throat and I gargled with TheraBreath every few hours to keep the bacteria down and no only did I prevent my usually allergy induced sore throat but I had super fresh breath.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Terrific product. The mouthwash really performs beautifully</li>
    <li> This will take some getting used to.  Not sweet, like most mouth washes.  Wanted the no alcohol.  It burns my mouth.  Think I will like this better as I use it more.  Good ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great Product It really does freshen your breathe and it helps with dry mouth. I would definitely recommend this problem for anyone with dry mouth issues or that has problems with bad breathe smell.</li>
    <li> I got this for my teenage son because he was getting tonsil stones.  I didn&#x27;t even know that there was such a thing until, one day, he spit a cluster into his hand  while he was talking to me.  He said this was happening about once a week.  I, quickly, researched on the internet a found out what it  was.  Some of the sites reccommened this mouthwash, so I ordered it right away.  My son reports that he has not had any tonsil stones since he has been using it, which is about a month and a half.  He, also, said it is very mild tasting.</li>
    <li> I would say a great product. Does work but I personally don&#x27;t like the color of the bottle or the taste of the mouth wash. It is not bad or nothing but seems to work less than the blue bottle and comes with a bigger taste. Does work better than nothing. The good thing is it has a little cheaper price.</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used. My husband likes it too. It does not dry our mouths out like other popular mouthwashes. I especially like it because I still have my tonsils and TheraBreath cleans them nicely when I gargle. We wake up with much fresher breath too.</li>
    <li> it is very effective.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect mouthwash for adults and kids. Doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling like you&#x27;ve swallowed soap.&lt;br /&gt;The two bottles are perfect size. And this economy pack is great for a guest bathroom</li>
    <li> Lasts 12 hours. IMMEDIATE results! Magic in a bottle</li>
    <li> The best product on the market. The entire family uses it for over a year and we love it!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is excellent!  It tastes like baking soda and leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and clean, not like it&#x27;s on fire.</li>
    <li> I have never been so happy with a purchase. It was definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;It worked the very first time I used. The direction says to use two cups each time, one for mouth and one for throat. I guess you can use only one cup to wash both mouth and throat. This way it will last twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is recommended to use it twice daily, but I have been using it once a day in the morning, because unless I am waking up next to a girl, I don&#x27;t care if my mouth smells during night time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Helps with keeping breath fresh all day, has a nice light taste, and I have no tonsil stones!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a while and it seemed to work well. I then tried a few other \\&quot;alcohol free\\&quot; store brand products to try and save money. While I was busy trying other brands I noticed that those disgusting tonsil stones (white balls in the back of your throat) started coming back. Within a few days of switching back to this product, the tonsil stones were gone and have stayed away. I would not hesitate one bit in recommending this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and truly love it.  No alcohol, no offensive taste, no burning - AND - it works!  My only question is why is this product so expensive on Amazon?  I now buy it at Walmart for $7.97 per bottle.  The toothpaste is the same price.  I hope Amazon negotiates a better price - I would rather support  Amazon than Wallie World.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the only product/method i found to be effective in treating morning/bad breath. it restored my confidence in life! prior to this product, i tried everything and anything. i would run to the bathroom after lunch to brush my teeth at work, chew gum, etc. Still, i always felt self-conscious and physically moved away from people in the fear of offending them.  Using this product has changed all that. i am experiencing new freedom from such fear.&lt;br /&gt;if u haven&#x27;t tried it, i strongly urge that you do.</li>
    <li> Tried all the minty, alcohol based mouthwashes with no help. Tried TheraBreath and NO MORE SULFUR BREATH! This stuff is the real deal.</li>
    <li> If you want good oral hygiene then you can&#x27;t go wrong with Dr. Katz&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Listerine my entire life. I tried a sample of this product and was hooked... I am a grad student with limited income. Even though this product is quite expensive I find deals and coupons. It just shows my priority of having this product.</li>
    <li> This product is not too strong and leaves a clean feeling.  It does as promised and is all natural and not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product for tonsil stones. It does indeed affect your tastebuds, as other people have said, and is not FDA-approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are having trouble with tonsil stones, get a water pick (they have them at CVS, Walgreens, etc.) and gently remove them with water. No good can come of scary chemical mystery mouthwashes or poking around in there with a hard object.</li>
    <li> I first heard this product on the Howard Stern show because Sal the Stockbroker was talking about how great it was and Therabreath wasn&#x27;t a sponsor he was just saying what helped with his bad breath.  So, I decided to give it a shot and ordered the sample kit from the official site so I could try it before I bought the regular size. It&#x27;s Amazing because you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to help since there is no super duper foaming action as far as the toothpaste goes, and the mouthwash isn&#x27;t super minty, but it really does work. After using it I didn&#x27;t wake up with that dry, funky dragons breath. On the official site it explains how and why it works, and why the mainstream products are harming your teeth. This is a Wonderful product that not only stops bad breath (on a side note I really hate that word), but it fights cavities too!</li>
    <li> When I found out a couple of months ago that I had tonsil stones I had an oral breakdown.  I had to fix my problem and I had to fix it fast!  When I searched online ads for this product kept popping up, so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;While it did work at reducing the amount of tongue plaque, my tonsil stones didn&#x27;t go away.  So, yeah it helps with bad breath a bit but nothing more than an average mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;If you have tonsil stones try hydrogen peroxide first.  I know that it can be hard on the mouth so I only use it as mouthwash every few days and sometimes just dab a bit on my tongue.  That gets rid of bad breath and has cut way down on tonsil stones.  All of this for less than 10% the cost of TheraBreath!  Plus the green bottle clashes with my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;I am not upset that I tried it but I am glad I didn&#x27;t waste money by buying it in bulk.</li>
    <li> My son was told by our physician that he has tonsiliths &amp;#34;tonsil stones&amp;#34;.  We did not know these existed.  I researched several websites and this product was recommended by several customers for this problem....and I must say it works at keeping the recurrence at a much lower rate and also keeps your breath fresh.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have halitosis, I just wanted a good mouthwash and I highly recommend to anyone. This does the job without the harshness of typical scope/listerine mouthwashes. It is mild but strong and effective for making the mouth feel fresh.</li>
    <li> Good stuff bite here it&#x27;s way cheaper doesn&#x27;t get the burn in your mouth</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY mouthwash that has worked for me!!! I have VERY bad breath,as my husband will often tell me! I have tried everything,and this is the only one that gets rid of my awful breath! I hate having bad breath because it is so embarrassing! I brush my teeth twice a day and floss every night,yet still have bad breath. When I found this, and it worked, it literally helped my marriage! I love the taste of it,and I love that it doesn&#x27;t burn like Listerine does!</li>
    <li> I used this product one time only and after using it I immediately noticed changes in my taste sensations. Like N. Joyce who commented on this strange phenomenon after using the product I too am having the same experience. Not everything I try to consume tastes like swallowing detergent and it has ruined my appetite. I used the product for the first time two days ago and two days later my sense of taste is still not back to normal. Like the previous reviewer warned, do not go anywhere near this product unless you have Godzilla Breath and are in danger of knocking down buildings with it. My breath was normal but I simply wanted to try it to see what it tasted like. Bad idea! Thanksgiving is two days from now and I may be in for a forgettable holiday thanks to TheraBreath.</li>
    <li> Much more bearable than other types of mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Just bought a bottle of the oral rinse and when I googled the ingredients, most of them are known as toxic, cancer causing chemicals. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always like to keep my breath smelling fresh. I chew a lot of gum to make sure my breath is always fresh smelling, but it makes me hungry and want to over eat. I was looking for a product that actually worked and this is it. I&#x27;ve tried almost everthing and nothing compares to this stuff. I am a hooked customer and will keep lots of bottles on hand. Only negative is the bottle doesnt last long enough so it will get pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> good product, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent breath freshening product. I&#x27;ve been using ThereBreath for at least six years and will never change.</li>
    <li> The day before using this I scraped my morning tongue onto a paper towel, sniffed it and experienced a significant, unpleasant odor.  Rinsed my mouth and gargled with this before going to bed ; repeated the sniffing process and could detect no odor.  ZERO!  NADA!&lt;br /&gt;Repeated the whole process the next day and still could not find my original odor, not even a trace.</li>
    <li> awesome stuff gave 1 bottle to my dad. he to thought it worked great.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. completely eliminates bad breath. My mouth feels healthy and awesome!</li>
    <li> Very effective product that does exactly what is stated on the label. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this product. Like so many other reviewers, I suffered from bad breath for decades. I remember my sister telling me my breath was stinky at about age 10, and I&#x27;ve been self-conscious since then. More recently, my husband would often &#x27;remind&#x27; me to brush my teeth. I ordered this with hope, but low expectations. It REALLY works! I am so happy to finally feel condident. I no longer have to sleep facing away from my husband. When someone shows me a picture on their phone, I can comment on it before taking a step back. My confidence is finally back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just subscribed so I will never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note: I have experienced NO noticeable difference in the taste of foods or beverages, including water.</li>
    <li> Amazing I recommended 100% effective !!</li>
    <li> This product really is amazing - it really works! I&#x27;ve never suffered horribly bad breath, but have had occasional bouts with it (typically when I&#x27;m super busy, don&#x27;t eat right, and am drinking lots of coffee), and have the \\&quot;typical\\&quot; morning breath. Essentially my breath is probably \\&quot;average\\&quot;. When I first purchased this I really had no idea what it was, it was on sale, and I was sick of the marginal mouthwashes at the drugstore. I don&#x27;t really care for the typical drugstore mouthwash and the ingredient list in most of them is pretty horrible. I decided to try TheraBreath. The instructions on the back of the bottle are very elaborate, i.e. rinse twice, brush with their toothpaste, dip your floss in TheraBreath. I thought all that was way too much - it&#x27;d add another 5 minutes onto my morning routine! I simply decided to replace my typical mouthwash with TheraBreath - and that was it. The first time I tried it I liked it, it was just slightly minty and very neutral in flavor. By the third day I couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference this mouthwash made! My mouth and breath felt fresh and clean all day long! Morning breath was significantly reduced too! I&#x27;d just been using it with my normal brushing routine, once in the morning and once in the evening. At this point I wanted to learn more about the product and what was in it. I spent some time reading TheraBreath&#x27;s website and reviews on the Internet. I&#x27;ve been a diehard fan ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with \\&quot;average\\&quot; breath probably don&#x27;t require the elaborate routine recommended on the bottle. I don&#x27;t. The product IS expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it. I keep my eye out for sales and stock up (review the expiration date so you&#x27;ll know how long you can keep it around - most of my bottles have a expiration date a year or two out). TheraBreath also has sales twice a year where you can stock up at a price per bottle that is less than half of retail. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> At first this did not seem like it was doing a whole lot based on the taste etc. however; in combination with the toothpaste I have noticed the difference with morning breath etc. Use as directed twice a day and you should see a difference if you suffer from bad breath.</li>
    <li> Have used it for a few years and really like it.  It does not burn your mouth.</li>
    <li> Must-have dental hygiene item. Gives you fresh breath all day long, no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ran out and I can definitely tell a difference without it. My girlfriend now covers her nose when I talk close! Need to order more!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried this product. It doesn&#x27;t taste at all like the strong Listerine or Scope. At first I thought it tasted a little odd because I expected a strong or overpowering sensation and that didn&#x27;t happen. I haven&#x27;t timed the claims that it lasts up to 12 hours but after a few uses I immediately noticed the good and long lasting effects. It is also not drying like alcohol washes and this is a great benefit as well. Deserves the extra price paid and can be used in a small amount, which makes it even a better buy.</li>
    <li> We love this mouthwash.  No alcohol, better tasting than most, and really seems to work.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is like no other. My husband and I tried it for the first time and were shocked. It has no burning feeling at all whatsoever. I have a very sensitive mouth and even using mouthwashes that said they didn&#x27;t burn and didn&#x27;t contain alcohol were still harsh on my mouth. TheraBreath is as mild as water, but when you spit it out, your mouth is left feeling fresh and minty. Also great for keeping your tonsils clean if you gargle with it regularly. We are certainly willing to spend the extra money for this product.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product so far. You have got to try it.</li>
    <li> ITS A SIMPLY MAGIC IN A BOTTLE. I HAD THE TONSILOITIS PROBLEM,THIS MOUTHWASH TAKE CARE LOF EVERY THING.AWSOME...&lt;br /&gt;I THINK THE ONE REVIEW WHO HAD THE CHAP LIP PROBLEM ITS JUST A RARE CASE AND DOESN&#x27;T SUITES TO THAT PERSON.I DIDNOT FIND ANY OF THAT RYPE OF PROBLEM.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU DR KATRZ.</li>
    <li> My son is 12 years old and he is special need child, since he was little he always had bad breath.  Me and my wife tried everything, from scope listerine, and gum but that didn&#x27;t help at all.  We help him brush his teeth three times a day but also that didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I was watching the needs and therabreath founder Dr. katz was showing his problem in the news, so I said let give it a try. So I went to our local store (walmart) and find the product there, wow I have to tell you this product works, it has given my child better breath then I could of imagine, he breaths on me in the morning and tells me daddy, how does it smell I tell him wow son no one his better breath then you in the morning.  But what im saying is sometimes he forget to brush his teeth in the morning on the weekend, and tells me daddy smell my breath and guess what it doesn&#x27;t smell anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would like to thank Dr katz for a wonderful product, by the way it was a little expensive in walmart.  Amazon his it cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the tooth paste and mouth rinse. it works really does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always covered up my bad breath with gum and mints, but as soon as I started using this mouthwash twice a day, i no longer rely on gum and mints to hide my breath! I wish i knew about this sooner!! I didnt think i could ever get rid of my breath but i finally have and it feels so great! I hope it works as well for everyone else as it did for me. I would definitely recommend trying therabreath! Good luck!! :)</li>
    <li> The real strength of this product is that it is very effective at removing tonsil stones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain people because of the shape of their tonsils, eating habits, etc. are more likely to get these \\&quot;stones.\\&quot;  They are basically white little bits of hardened mucous / food / bacteria that form in and around your tonsils.  I am not sure if it is entirely understood as to what causes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They appear as white little dots on your tonsils.  You can manually remove them with a toothbrush or cotton swab, but they also form in tiny little crypts in your tonsils as well and are difficult to remove without some form of mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only even noticed that I had them one day when I coughed one of these tiny white specks up.  They smell *horrible* and are the likely the main cause of chronic bad breath if you have it.  A lot of people have them, but are unaware of them because they are usually pretty small, and are often hidden behind the folds in the back of your mouth.  I brush twice a day, and still occasionally get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some internet research, the best advice I could find was to use an alcohol-free, saccharin-free mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few different alcohol-free, saccharin-free mouthwashes: Biotene, Kiss-my-face, and this one.  I&#x27;d give 5 stars to all three of the mouthwashes, because each one is fairly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three, I have to say that the Therabreath mouthwash is probably the most effective at removing tonsil stones.  Each time I used it, I noticed a few of the little &#x27;stones&#x27; dislodging from my tonsils.  You really do need to gargle it for about a minute though to achieve the maximum effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons to Therabreath are that the packaging, and the actual rinse itself gives you the impression that you are gargling some odorless chemical solution as opposed to mouthwash.  It is also kind of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tonsil stones, I&#x27;d recommend first using Therabreath to dislodge all the stones, and then transitioning to another alcohol-free, saccharin free mouthwash that is cheaper and more pleasant to use, to prevent them from forming again.lcohol-free, saccharin free mouthwash that is cheaper and more pleasant to use, to prevent them from forming again.</li>
    <li> I used this rinse in the morning and it left a bad taste in my mouth all day.  It tainted the taste of food throughout the day and nothing I tried could make the bad taste go away.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product. I bought it based on the reviews right here at Amazon, and I&#x27;m not disappointed at all. After one use, I had essentially no odor coming from my mouth. I am a chronic sinus sufferer. My sinuses always seem to be draining. On top of that, I, admittedly, don&#x27;t have the best diet. These two things combined really affect my breath negatively. But after using this product even just once, I was able to eat, drink and nap, and whereas all these things before would seem to result in unbearably bad breath at times and just \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bad breath other times I had no bad breath after doing these things. It is long-lasting. I use twice a day, so there&#x27;s never a time when I detect bad breath from myself. Furthermore, my mouth feels cleaner and less heated on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons I don&#x27;t give it a full five stars? The bottle says \\&quot;Fresh Breath,\\&quot; and I think it is also advertised with words like \\&quot;mint fresh\\&quot; breath. I don&#x27;t find this to be the case. I find their description of \\&quot;neutralizing\\&quot; to be far more accurate because your breath has more of a neutral scent than a fresh or minty one after using this. I would actually say that the rinse tastes like Hydrogen Peroxide to me (I have used HP in rinsing several times before), and that&#x27;s the taste and odor I would say I am left with in my mouth all day and all night. I don&#x27;t find this particularly pleasant. And as I mentioned being able to eat, drink and sleep, and wake up without bad breath...for example, if you drink Coke, the taste will linger on your tongue, but you can still also taste this rinse and as time goes by the taste of the rinse will again become more prevalent in your mouth. This would be fine if the rinse had a more pleasant taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I really can&#x27;t complain much about the HP-like quality of the rinse. Before using this rinse, if I drank Coke, I would have bad breath until I brushed my teeth or rinsed with some rinse, and the bad breath would still come back. TheraBreath does what it&#x27;s supposed to do in that regard, and I would rather walk around with HP-tasting neutrality in breath than bad breath, especially since I work in the public sector.&#x27;s supposed to do in that regard, and I would rather walk around with HP-tasting neutrality in breath than bad breath, especially since I work in the public sector.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. I wear a night guard and used to wake up with a horrible taste in my mouth. After using this oral rinse for just a short period of time, I now wake up with no offensive odors at all. Prior to purchasing this, I used several other brands of mouthwash at night. Nothing performed even close to this product. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it definitely works as advertised. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have used a whole bottle and I feel like the product keeps my breath fresh, like promised.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would surpass other mouthwashes, but they all last about the same. The one big advantage is that you don&#x27;t end up reeking of mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> awesome product! Wish I knew about it sooner ...I subscribe and save this product every month. It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product, especially if you are prone to ulcers because it neutralizes acid rather than making it worse like most (acidic) mouthwashes do. It also doesn&#x27;t have the acidic &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that most mouthwashes do. Just a mild, pleasant minty taste. I love this product and highly recommend it! Probably great for teeth sensitive to acidity, too!</li>
    <li> I like to drink coffee in the morning, but I could always taste the coffee in my mouth afterwards, even if I used other mouthwashes.  I have to talk to a lot people as part of my job, and I don&#x27;t want them to suffer through talking to me while I have bad breath.  This product works well.  I use this in conjunction with Crest Pro Health, and it completely clears out my mouth.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste, and it doesn&#x27;t have a burning sensation, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product over 2 years and always happy with it. It isn&#x27;t harsh for my mouth like other strong scent&#x27;s mouth linse products -and very gentle. It looks like a bit pricy compared with other products but it is not actually. It&#x27;s really helpful to get rid of morning breath smell and dry mouth. I recommeded this product to my co-work who had been suffering from dry mounth problem, and she was completely satisfied with it! Try once, and you will keep to purchase them forever. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who gags so easily whenever I brush my teeth. So even if the instructions says use a full cup from the container I still gag so I just use half of it. Reason I gag with this one compared to another product was that it just tasted water and really mild mint only. I am still undecided if this things work or not. One thing I noticed it just eliminate a little morning breath but still I have to go back to my old routine of chewing gums because I am still not confident with the results. Maybe I should try a different tactic next time on how can I get a benefit out of this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful , I can not do without it</li>
    <li> It worked fine but I did not see a lot of difference than regular mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I was amazed that it actually worked over night!? I bought 2 bottles of the mouthwash (this item) and the starter  kit (http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Katz-Thera-Breath-Starter/dp/B000RU5KOY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1271129655&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2). I rarely have the tonsil stones some people mention but mainly notice that i have a lot of white build up on my tongue (which tastes rank).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I used the mouth wash (green bottle), 2nd mouth wash (tablet mix), throat spray and nasal drops (i wanted to be sure!) I woke up this morning with no usual bitter / bad taste in my mouth, i can&#x27;t smell any bad breath at all and my tongue surface is perfectly pink for the first time in ... i don&#x27;t know how long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am amazed as I partly thought this whole Therabreath + Dr. Katz thing sounded dodgy... like a typical infomercial product. Although I couldn&#x27;t ignore all the amazon appraisals so tried it and I&#x27;m really pleased. I might post back after a month with what else i find.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Makes my breath taste like nothing. I used to suck mints all day, especially when I was talking with people. Now, I don&#x27;t need them at all. My breath is fresh all day long. It is truly amazing. You must try this if you have any breath problems. It&#x27;s changed my life. I&#x27;m so much more confident. Thanks Dr. Katz!!</li>
    <li> At first it seemed like Therabreath worked like magic(really amazing). I had about eight hours of good breath. Unfortunately, after a week&#x27;s worth of use, I noticed that the effects were lessening day by day. It&#x27;s become so ineffective (im very sad) to the point that it wears out after a couple hours of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im use the toot paste and oral rinse but not work.&lt;br /&gt;bad breath cursed, pls help me. idk what to do.</li>
    <li> Oxygenation is about the only surefire way to kill bacteria, and this does great for it. Much better on your mouth&#x27;s health than traditional mouthwashes and all their alcohol, and I love the way it leaves my breath smelling for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> I think it really works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and works really well!</li>
    <li> tried this one, as well as Act, Colgate and Crest. All mediocre results... Helps breath for about 30 -60 minutes then the bad breath would slowly creep back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend Closys mouthwash instead--worked wonders for my breath.</li>
    <li> I Bought this and the toothpaste because I smoke and always have smoke breath ...Best ever ... I&#x27;ll never use another brand. I keep blowing my breath on my husband and he smells NOTHING .Neither do I and I still smoke .I can&#x27;t even taste the cigarette after I&#x27;m done .Love it .</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff.  I don&#x27;t use 2 capfuls each morning and each night as recommended, and I can&#x27;t hold it in for a full 90 seconds, but it seems to be helping the dragon breath.  Was using a different product which worked fine, but this one is more cost effective and I like the mildness.  It&#x27;s nice to be called into an unexpected meeting at work and not have to worry about grabbing a piece of gum first.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try out this product by reading all the positive comments.  At first it seemed like Therabreath worked like magic. I had about eight hours of good breath, whether I was eating, taking a nap, or talking for hours (which always seems to make my breath worse). I even recommended the product to my dad.  Unfortunately, after a week&#x27;s worth of use, I noticed that the effects were lessening day by day. It&#x27;s become so ineffective to the point that it wears out after a couple hours of use. I don&#x27;t take any shortcuts with the product, I use the recommended dosage and the time (1 minute of use, followed by a 30 second use right after), so I&#x27;m not doing anything wrong with the directions.  It is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> It actually works, but the taste is not really pleasant. I also use much smaller portion than recommended and it is still fine.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll order something with more strong taste.</li>
    <li> It really works. You can&#x27;t smell anything after using this product. Kills morning breath every sing time. Will be buying it again :-)</li>
    <li> Dr. Katz Oral Rinse comes to your bad breath rescue.  As an addition benefit, it cuts down on sore throat symptoms.</li>
    <li> TheraBreath Oral Rinse helps stop your bad breath and end chronic halitosis. This rinse uses the odor-obliterating power of OXYD-8 for treating bad breath, stopping halitosis and eliminating sour, bitter and metallic tastes in your mouth. These is a must have in a mouthwash. It refreshes your mouth and it stays refreshed for quite some time afterwards. It is really nice when you fell like your mouth just needs refreshed but your teeth is clean this really does the trick on that.</li>
    <li> Works awesome and I love that it has auto ship! My son had really rank breathe and this has solved our problem!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from a breath \\&quot;affliction\\&quot; my entire life. I never knew of any non-surgical remedies for this. Awhile back, I discovered solutions for this problem area and have settled on TheraBreath as my choice brand. This has changed my life so much that I cannot count the ways. No longer am I embarrassed by seeing and hearing the reactions of people who catch a whiff of my malodor or even seeing them struggle to prevent from showing a reaction. True halitosis sufferers, you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bear in mind that with this brand or other comparable brands, do not expect the taste to be easily palatable, at first. In no time, you will be used to it and will actually appreciate it. I use it twice a day along with the TheraBreath toothpaste and a tongue scraper (and flossing, of course). The process is not as long as you might imagine. My typical regimen is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Pre-rinse/gargle with TheraBreath oral rinse&lt;br /&gt;2. Scrape tongue&lt;br /&gt;3. Brush with TheraBreath toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;4. Floss&lt;br /&gt;5. Post-rinse/gargle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend about 6-8 minutes both in the morning and before bed. IT IS SUCH A SMALL PRICE TO PAY to have a renewed sense of self-esteem and confidence in social dealings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experimented with what skipping a day or two would do by returning to just your normal popular brand oral care products. I can feel/smell my natural malodorous breath return quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried and then purchased the lozenges. They are merely small, individually wrapped breath mints but are GREAT to put one or two in the pocket when going out. You just take one when you feel your mouth begin to get dry. With other breath freshening gum and mints, you are frequently popping more trying to mask the scent. So you don&#x27;t have to worry about carrying a bulky pack of gum, a roll of mints, or a can of Altoids. And one goes a LONG way. (For the record, I almost NEVER use them. I only keep one with me for \\&quot;emergencies\\&quot; but rarely feel the need to use it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Katz&#x27;s website is informative if you would like to learn more about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, do not believe that this will give you permanent fresh breath. These products do not \\&quot;mask\\&quot; your breath like mouthwashes and gum do. It will ELIMINATE the REAL bad breath causing GERMS. If you do not keep up the daily use, those germs will grow back. But if you eat an onion sandwich or a squid-salad, that isn&#x27;t bad breath... that&#x27;s FOOD-breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is not for those who just \\&quot;believe\\&quot; they have bad breath. This is for those who have suffered greatly the alienation that is felt with the affliction of chronic halitosis. I am writing this review in the hopes that it will help other sufferers like myself.uld like to learn more about it.  Also, do not believe that this will give you permanent fresh breath.

    <li> This product works exceptionally and although I didn&#x27;t need it so much, it solved a family member&#x27;s issue.</li>
    <li> According to the insert, TheraBreath works by specifically targeting the volatile sulfur compounds that form on the tongue and which are a major source of bad breath and chronic sour taste.  While I&#x27;ve never had an issue with bad breath, I do sometimes have a sour taste in my mouth later in the day.  I first bought TheraBreath several years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it pretty consistently ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s funny is that when you use TheraBreath for the first time, it doesn&#x27;t taste or feel at all potent, like Listerine, Scope, Biotene, or the myriad other mouthwashes on store shelves.  Instead, TheraBreath tastes like slightly minty water.  Despite the underwhelming first impression, the product works; once the mint taste dissipates, you&#x27;re left with a neutral taste in your mouth, and your breath smells like . . . well, like air.  Also, you&#x27;ll notice that your foods and beverages taste different, which indicates, at least to me, that the sulfur compounds on the tongue have a profound effect on our sense of taste, and that it&#x27;s only when these compounds are removed that we&#x27;re able to notice their effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I gladly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is a temporary remedy for what people think are bacteria. You will use the product for at least 4 times a day for the rest of his life and so have bad breath even after a long dinner with wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case the problem is with tonsil stones and you can see a video related to this issue on youtube! I hope this can serve you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with the TheraBreath rinse. It has no burn of regular alcohol or the newer crest rinse, and doesn&#x27;t have the safety concerns of hydrogen peroxide (no swallowing!). I would equate it about as effective at neutralizing bad breath as gargling with hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me I use it twice a day, once before bed and once as a part of my morning routine. I can feel it starting to wear off in the morning, but for the most part it has killed my morning breath as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely swish before gargling, as swishing loosens up tonsil stones before gargling. I&#x27;ve used slightly less than recommended for gargling, as it bubbles up quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will definitely be in my cabinet for those times when I need to freshen up!</li>
    <li> My husband was struggling with bad breath. He found this product and has seen amazing results. No more bad breath!!! Highly Reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best mouthwash that I haver used.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be a little stronger, but all in all, a good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it absolutely works.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does. Great oral rinse without the biting mint.</li>
    <li> It really works. My wife would complain about my breath. I tried all the name brands and none got rid of the bad breath. Out of desperation I tried TheraBreath and it actually worked and still does for me. I also switched to their toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I made. Instead of wasting your time and money searching for a name brand that might work for you,  just order one bottle of TheraBreath mouth wash and one tube of TheraBreath toothpaste. Your spouse will let you back into the house after this move!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Cured my bad breathe in only a few days! :) I also am noticing whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> very appealing mint flavor; not so strong that your eyes water and it burns your tongue.  Give it a try if other mouth wash makes you feel like you shouldn&#x27;t have used it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product we&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s effective at fighting tonsil stones.  It both reduces their occurrence and helps to remove existing ones.  It doesn&#x27;t prevent them completely but it&#x27;s definitely a huge help.  Gargle it every night.  I also add about 10 drops of concentrated grape seed oil to each bottle of this product, and I find that increases the effectiveness even more.</li>
    <li> I have chronic sinus issues and that results in some horrific-smelling breath. I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Katz for years and just realized you can get it on Amazon too - awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I rinse with this at night, I DO NOT wake up with any morning breath whatsoever. When I rinse in the morning I know I&#x27;ll be good until at least lunch and usually a lot longer. For anyone suffering from halitosis, I know the lack of confidence you experience - don&#x27;t wait ONE MORE MINUTE...buy TheraBreath and just be done with it for good.</li>
    <li> Just happened to select this mouthwash at the store because I can&#x27;t stand the typical Scope or Listerne. They burn my mouth so badly it hurts! But despite reservations if it would work or not, I&#x27;m glad I did try it. No burning! No bad taste while using it or after taste. And it works. I managed to get my husband to try it also. (he really did need it) And no more bad breath for him. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Effective product for persisent bad breath odors.  It actually kills the bacteria that causes the bad odors.  As opposed to more common commercial \\&quot;mouthwashes\\&quot; that usually cover and mask the bad odor for a time, when used regularly in conjuction with the Oxygenating Toothpaste, this product is very effective in controlling and eliminating chronic bad breath.</li>
    <li> BEST product I have ever purchased on Amazon over the years. I have no idea why this product is not found in major stores. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. I love it. Absolutely fresh breath thru-out the day. And of course no more morning breath. p.s. I will certainly look into buying other of their products.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash ever!  I love it my mouth feels clean ..no burning no aftertaste ..really great product will purchase again</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It leaves your mouth feeling very clean and is not harsh like Listerine.  It is expensive, though.  I try to stretch it a bit by using a slightly smaller amount than is recommended in the directions.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this product at first, but since I had some gift card money from amazon, I decided I would give it a shot.  I was looking for something that would help get rid of the awful breath I got during the acute phase of mono.  It was bad.  I mean bad. But gargling with this every morning and night took care of the problem almost immediately.  After the first use the bad taste in my mouth was gone and those around me complained less about my breath.  After 2 days of use it was back to a neutral breath.</li>
    <li> Nice mouthwash.  Listerine is too strong for me - I prefer this brand much more.</li>
    <li> I would say it is fairly effective in fighting bad breath, but the taste is completely underwhelming. I tried the icy mint flavor from a walmart and was hooked because the menthol gave it a refreshingly strong mint aftertaste. They no longer carry it there so I rushed to buy this stuff as a replacement, but regret buying it due to its bland, barely mint flavor.</li>
    <li> We, too had tried everything for my daughter&#x27;s bad breath...almost took her to the ENT to think about getting her tonsils out, ? Tonsil stones...but when she uses this product as directed...Viola!  Finally, things are much better.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year-old guy who didn&#x27;t have any problems with bad breath until about two years ago.  My wife started telling me my breath was worse than usual, even though I was still brushing, flossing, and using a tongue scraper daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about tonsoliths (so gross), and started using a waterpik.  Didn&#x27;t help.  Started cleaning my tonsils manually (SO gross).  Didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started chewing gum while at work, even though none of my friends/colleagues ever complained about my breath the way my wife did (although I wasn&#x27;t trying to kiss them).  Eventually moved to brushing my teeth when I got home from work, because my wife wouldn&#x27;t talk to me otherwise.  It was depressing, and she felt bad about it, but my breath was an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I are both doctors, and I don&#x27;t put any stock in homeopathy or any other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; garbage with no actual evidence of efficacy.  I gave this a try expecting to be disappointed, but am happy to say that at least for me, it works like a charm.  I started using without telling my wife, and by the second day I came home from work, and was greeted with, \\&quot;Did you do something different?  Your breath doesn&#x27;t smell!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product won&#x27;t cure your bad breath.  It temporarily gets rid of the odor and helps clear out tonsoliths, but it isn&#x27;t a permanent solution.  You need to use it daily.  In my experience, you don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much as the bottle says.  If you follow the instructions as written you&#x27;ll be through the bottle in about a week.  I just use one dose at morning and night, and focus on gargling.  The odor isn&#x27;t coming from my teeth, my gums, or the roof and sides of my mouth - it&#x27;s coming from my tonsils and the back of my tongue.  Just gargle for a minute twice a day, and you&#x27;re good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sensitive about your breath, give this a try.  It&#x27;s $15 and it made a huge difference in my quality of life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mouthwash, but the bottle leaks every time I fly with it.  It&#x27;s the most frustrating thing.  It&#x27;s made multiple messes in my suitcase and drenched my clothes. I&#x27;ve tried everything from tightening the cap as much as possible and wrapping it in multiple paper towels.  Such a disappointment</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste that bad.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once (last night after flossing and brushing).  I wear plastic retainers every night while I sleep (they look like invisiline) and I think that since they wrap right around the teeth that they cause that yucky morning breath.  I woke up this morning and my breath is neutral.  There is no perceptible bad breath.  It&#x27;s a perfect product. I was so shocked this morning that Thera Breath worked not just a little bit but there was an amazing difference;  No morning breath. Yipeeee.</li>
    <li> My husband and I swear by this product. We go through 4 bottles a month and auto ship from amazon. This is his one non negotiable toiletry. Other mouthwashes need not apply. This balances your mouth to a natural taste, not cover it up with mint and strip it with alcohol. It will knock out anything- garlic, morning breath, coffee, any bad taste. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is refreshing without being too strong. It helps with dry mouth as a result of taking allergy meds this time of year! I&#x27;ve used one bottle and started the second so now I&#x27;m ready to buy more so I always have it on hand.  Some reviews I read said it was too mild, however, I thought it was just right so that you when you rinse for 60 seconds you are not feeling a burning sensation afterward (like other brands will do).  Will recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> we find it to be the best oral rinse. it really neutrilize the smell</li>
    <li> I really like the gentle taste and lack of dry mouth that this mouthwash leaves you with. I rinse my mouth out probably three or four times every day (just out of habit really) and this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Completely soothing, leaves a non-chemical clean sensation in my mouth!  I love this product, just wish the bottles were a bi bigger.</li>
    <li> I purchased TheraBreath Oral Rinse for my 12 year old son who suffered from terrible halitosis.  No matter how much he brushed and gargled with other products recommended by his dentist, nothing seemed to work.  After only using this product for one week, his bad breath has disappeared.  I only have him use 1/2 a cap full for the mouth rinse and 1/2 cap full for the gargle, and it works just fine.  I did think it was a little pricey for mouthwash, but given the results, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Does exactly as advertised.  Only drawback is that it&#x27;s bland / flavorless.</li>
    <li> My suggestion, other than using it as instructed, is after a couple of days of using rinsing... use it every other day. It&#x27;s very powerful cleaning ingredients were too much for me, so I held back a little. Still, my teeth and gums have never felt cleaner. I recommend this oral rinse!</li>
    <li> Very mild but effective in predicting fresh breath</li>
    <li> So far so good. Does sort of take care of bad breath.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> It tastes pretty good and really works well.</li>
    <li> I love Therabreath. I have horrific acid reflux and continuous dry mouth and this knocks out the dryness and bad breath.  In addition, for anyone else that suffers this chronic condition, I have noticed that when I don&#x27;t eat sugar I have no problems with bad breath.  But that is really hard to stick to.  Anywho, really like this product. It&#x27;s cheaper at Wal-mart however, about $8/each.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but the packaging has always been a pain.  It is so difficult to open the top of the packaging that I now go through the bottom.  But what is most annoying is the paper seal that is under the cap.  For awhile they went to a plastic seal, but now it seems they&#x27;ve gone back to paper.  The problem is that the paper seal does not stay in the cap.  I don&#x27;t pour a measured amount, instead, I just swig it, but more often than not I end up with the paper seal in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the new green bottle!</li>
    <li> You might see my reviews for several other mouthwash type products here on Amazon.  I&#x27;m in the midst of trying several new products which do not contain Sodium Laurel Sulfate in an attempt to lessen or cure my canker sore problem.  I&#x27;ve been suffering from an increase outbreak in canker sores over the last year and through research have found that SLS is considered a leading cause.  Guess what, well both my toothpaste and Listerine both have SLS in them, so time to trying something different.  I hate giving up Listerine.  I really like that mouthwash especially in the morning.  Really freshens up my breath after a night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is complete opposite of Listerine.  Zero burning sensation and almost no taste except for a slight minty feeling.  It&#x27;s easy to use and has very little aftertaste.  It does appear to get rid of morning breath, so I think it&#x27;s doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My canker outbreaks are still happening, but it might be too early to tell if switching to a non-SLS mouthwash is going to help.  I&#x27;ll keep using this product as I have no complaints about it.  If things take a turn for the better I&#x27;ll let you know!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED A GAZILLION PRODUCTS IN MY 30 YEARS AND THIS TRULY WORKS FOR ME.  I AM CONFIDENT WHEN I AM CLOSE TO SOMEONE THAST MY BREATH IS NOT OFFENSIVE!</li>
    <li> I bought Therabreath for the first time about five or six years ago and I used it only a couple times before stopping due to a strong metallic aftertaste.  Out of sheer desperation, I tried it again last week and I can&#x27;t believe how effective it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked Therabreath&#x27;s website to find out more information and they said that their formula has undergone many changes throughout the years.  I can attest that those changes are for the better because there is absolutely NO metallic aftertaste and it totally works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I&#x27;ve fought bad breath for close to 25 years...the last 10 years I have literally chewed gum non-stop.  By non-stop I mean that when I spit out the old piece of gum I would immediately put a new one in my mouth.  Anybody who has chronic bad breath knows how this can rattle your confidence.  I spent more time worrying about whether the person I was talking to could smell my breath rather than focusing on the actual conversation. I&#x27;d stand further away and speak softer so as to not be offensive.  It was a miserable part of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now everything has changed.  I chew maybe one piece of gum a day.  My tonsil stones are gone (I think this was the source of my bad breath). I feel free from the self-doubt and shame of bad breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t write reviews on products, but in this case, I figure if I can help someone who is suffering like I was, then it&#x27;s worth it! Give it a try....if you have chronic bad breath, it&#x27;s a life-saver!</li>
    <li> I tried this along with the costly sinus irrigation system , used it for months , did not work at all.</li>
    <li> My hubby follows directions on bottle, and this works!  It&#x27;s only one we&#x27;ve found that takes out his bad breath.  Highly recommended.  Is expensive, and amazon price is best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> My son has horrible halitosis.  This mouth wash really makes a difference in his breath and I&#x27;m grateful to have found it.</li>
    <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I prefer the blue flavor. This one has no flavor. You don&#x27;t have bad breath. I just prefer the other flavor</li>
    <li> Works great and has a mild, minty taste - does not burn at all. I love it!</li>
    <li> Best rinse. Really works!</li>
    <li> Not harsh. Very refreshing. Helps with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> It would be almost criminal not to post this review.For years I&#x27;ve obsessed with dental care(ORAL HYGIENE),tounge and teeth brushing twice a day,flossing ,mouthwashes and dental visits,however it didnt seem to be adequate,i COULDNT HELP BUT NOTICE AN  occasionally &#x27; OF odour&#x27; some rotten egg smell rising from my throat.&lt;br /&gt;And if it WASNT  a subtle shift of the person I&#x27;m talking to ,they&#x27;d be offering mints and gums.;-(&lt;br /&gt;It took a serios knock on my confidence as my job entails talking to poeple all day,fast foward..... I stumbled across THERABREATH during my intense research,decided to give it a go.Yipee !!I wish I&#x27;d know about it ages ago,started less than 48 hours ago,as of 30th june 2011,following the instructions to the letter .&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt be more pleased with the results,in this short period of time;-)*&lt;br /&gt;I took pics of my tonsils stones,yuck!! but guessed its one of the ways to tell if its working at all,pre therabreath they were covered in thick yellowy coating,tucked away comfatably at the back of my throat(shocked me ,but had to swiftly get over it and deal with it)&lt;br /&gt;after exactly 4 washes about 85% of the coating gone ,a few specs left -Im confident by the end of the week it will be history.&lt;br /&gt;Yes its kinda expensive but for the peeace of mind it seems to provide ,definately worth it.(any ideas where one can source it at a discount?)&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from a local supplier in JHB- South Africa.morning breath is neutral,go ahead and try it for yourself.....what are you waiting for?&lt;br /&gt;the free Ebook very informative ,learnt a lot from it about oral hygiene.SMILING....</li>
    <li> Was so happy when I came across TheraBreath many years ago.  It really works and I love that this original formula has no flavor.  I hate those gross minty mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this at all!  It left a horrible aftertaste in my mouth.  Made everything I ate taste terrible, and this awful taste lasted all day and evening.  Yuck!  Threw it out!</li>
    <li> Bought this because of dry mouth bad breath from medicine.  First couple days were great, THEN I lost my taste buds! Nothing tastes good.  Going on 2nd day of not tasting.  Would not recommend this on the outside chance this could happen to anyone else!  I&#x27;m hoping after a few days, I&#x27;ll be fine.  Definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> Weak, will not buy again nor recommend. Tasted watered down.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash sucks. I will never buy this mess again. It doesnt last long. Do yourself a favor and just buy Colgate mouthwash. This bulld*** sucks. I wish I could give it 0 stars.</li>
    <li> I am a smoker, and this really works.  I even had one of my friends ask me if I quit smoking.  Really good stuff, I will reorder more.</li>
    <li> Took a long time for me to spend the extra money to try this. However I am sold.  My breath is fresher than it has ever been, and it lasts longer than any mouthwash I have ever used. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t rinse out a layer of your mouth tissue like most mouth rinse do. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I realized I ate dishes or foods that had a lot of onions and garlic and these spices actually contributed to badbreath big time! All those branded mouthwashes in the market just didn&#x27;t work for me. And then came Therabreath (saw their ad on YT) I just used the toothpaste and the oral rinse this evening after I had dinner. I love the toothpaste because it is gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn. The best feeling was after I gargled with the Therabreath Oral rinse. My breath smells so fresh and I really like the clean-feel after the gargle. Although it is expensive but I thought it was worth the purchase. My order from Amazon hasn&#x27;t arrived yet so I went to Walmart to check if there was Therabreath because I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product out and luckily they had! I kinda regretted I ordered through Amazon which was quite expensive than in Walmart but it&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;ll be a good supply for me since Walmart runs out of stock really fast. That&#x27;s how good the product is! Try it!</li>
    <li> FRESH MOUTH EVER! this mouthwash is gold! i have been using it for almost a year now and it leaves your breath feeling so fresh and gets rid of any odor. Definitely recommend! I am currently using this as my everyday moutwash.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. This doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes, and its effects last for at least 10 hours. I don&#x27;t want to walk around unknowingly impersonating Drogon from Game of Thrones. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to brush and thoroughly clean your tongue before using it.</li>
    <li> I also get those nasty little tonsil stones, and I have a terrible time getting rid of them. Manual attempts (finger, q-tips, tweezers, chopsticks - I&#x27;ve tried it all) are pretty much useless and only cause me to gag and make my tonsils bleed. It&#x27;s been a real problem; I am a person who is pretty conscious of personal hygiene, and knowing that my breath is gross and not being able to do anything about it freaks me out! I was pretty skeptical that a mouthwash would be able to help (after all, I use listerine religiously and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a thing) but after using this stuff for 2 days, my stones are almost completely gone. Seriously, a little gargling and my tonsil stones are going away on their own. I was somewhat wary because a few of the reviews said that the rinse could affect my sense of taste, but fortunately I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with that so far. Also, the instructions say to use the special toothpaste along with it, but the mouth wash by itself seems to be doing the job just fine.</li>
    <li> awesome stuff. works like a charm</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting and burn like Listerine and no more bad breath.  Worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> I have had bad breath all my adult life.  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  The last straw was when a guy actually wrinkled his nose while I was talking to him!  I tried Dr. Katz&#x27;s products out of desparation.  OMG, this stuff really works!  I know it works because I don&#x27;t have the horrible taste in my mouth anymore.  I can find no fault with this product.  I use it as directed -- 3 times a day.  Really, I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  It truly gave me back my confidence.  If you struggle with bad breath, please at least give this product a try before you give up like I almost did.</li>
    <li> Excellent product half the price at the local store</li>
    <li> Wow! All I have to say, it took a week for it to work, but at the end it&#x27;s all worth it!! It definitely gets rid of bad morning breath, but along with brushing your tongue!! I love this mouthwash!!!! No more morning breath and embarrassing moments at work!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps my breath fresh for most of the day. Using a tongue cleaner helps with bad breath too. :)</li>
    <li> I have just started using it so I can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy, but I like that it isn&#x27;t as harsh as alcohol based mouth washes.</li>
    <li> I liked it, so that fresh breath</li>
    <li> Not cheap as mouth washes go, but worth every penny and then some if your goal is long-lasting fresh breath that cheaper mouthwashes can&#x27;t deliver.</li>
    <li> Not that strong but natural feeling  not hurt at all</li>
    <li> This would be 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t soo expensive. As far as how it works five stars all over the board. Best mouth wash ever!</li>
    <li> Have always liked this mouthwash.  Cleans without burning..helps tongue and teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d love it more if it was a stronger flavor... but this is perfect for those who prefer less flavor... It is great for your mouth!</li>
    <li> I perfer this better than most oral rinse in the supermarket.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is amazing!!!!! it works, you only need a little bit, gets rids of tonsil stones and it also smells and feels great. Also another thing, it is cheaper than smart mouth and doesn&#x27;t leave you with dry mouth like smart mouth does. Anyway i love everything about this product and i will buy over and over again. I got mines from target i didn&#x27;t even know about it, i was just randomly looking for a mouthwash different than smart mouth and i actually liked the bottle and the colors LOL and i was like \\&quot;okay, it says Dr...let&#x27;s try, it&#x27;s only 7$ anyway\\&quot;...well i&#x27;m glad i did because it works!!! I don&#x27;t have chronic bad breath but i am sure it works fine with people who do :).</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for bad breath.</li>
    <li> Helps with breathe, I am a smoker so love this</li>
    <li> I just used the mouthwash for the first time. Did not use the toothpaste. I immediately could tell it was different. I had a fresh minty feeling but it wasn&#x27;t overbearing. It just felt really clean and fresh. I went to have lunch, a salad with lots of things in it and everything tasted great. In fact, maybe better because my mouth felt so genuinely fresh that I think my food wasn&#x27;t mixing with all the nasty bacteria that was in my mouth before. I don&#x27;t know. But for me, I can say I didn&#x27;t lose a sense of taste at all like some others did. I have a very good feeling I&#x27;m going to really like this product as I continue to use it. The freshest my mouth and throat have ever felt.</li>
    <li> I have a dear loved one who had the dreaded &#x27;poop breath&#x27; issue and this was the only thing that really worked on it. Use this stuff with tongue-brushing and flossing and you will see a vast improvement in a day or so.</li>
    <li> After hearing several recommendations for this and tonsil stones I gave it a try. I&#x27;m also sensitive to mouth ulcers with various other mouthwashes (even The blue colored Dr Katz bottle). This one works great, doesn&#x27;t burn or leave my mouth dry, and seems to help keep my tonsils clear. Flavor is good and not too strong. I have been using it for over a yea and a half now and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> From put of nowhere my wife informed me that it smelled like something died in my mouth.  This took me by surprise because I brush twice a day and floss every night.  The smell came on quickly and would not go away, I don&#x27;t know what brought it on.  I began using Listerine but that did not help and from what they say at therabreath, it may have made matters worse.  I got the mouthwash, toothpaste and breath mints on Monday and began using them right away as directed (brush, mouthwash, floss and mouthwash again) twice a day.  Last night (Wednesday) I asked the wife about my breath...she said it smelled fine.  I went from constant detectable odor from 4-5 feet away to no odor even when close up in three days.  It may have even worked faster but I never asked if my breath smelled until Wednesday and considering that she does not hesitate to tell me if it does smell I believe that it did work faster.  It leaves your teeth felling so smooth and clean.  If you have bad breath get this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a placebo joke. I don&#x27;t have dry mouth or bad breath, so I can&#x27;t speak about what it does to those or whatever may cause them, but this does not seem to do anything helpful in terms of hygiene. I feel like it GIVES me dry mouth for the first two hours or so after using it, and the \\&quot;fresh breath\\&quot; feeling lasts -maybe- until lunch. Also, it&#x27;s just a feeling. I found that if I eat something, I can&#x27;t smell it very well myself because my sense of taste and smell are numbed by something in the mouthwash, but if I really try I can smell my breath and it does smell if I eat something that would normally make it smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have to use another mouth wash before or after this, because I can tell this does NOT do anything to kill germs in my mouth. For me this is easy to tell, because I have a very sensitive sense of smell. So even with the numbed senses this gives I can tell after my breath smells the same as before but with a chewing gum smell added. That is, the same thing happens with chewing gum - you can smell a good smell, but you can feel and (with a strong sense of smell) smell the other stuff underneath. At best, it seems to try to cover up bad smells with peppermint smell and numb your ability to smell/taste anything else. If you don&#x27;t have a strong sense of smell, try asking a friend to smell your breath about 15 minutes before and after using this, I bet they&#x27;ll think you just chewed some gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really lame, not worth spending money on it. Really wish I had just stuck to regular mouth wash (although I&#x27;m not thrilled with that either, it&#x27;s still better than this).</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible.  It left a terrible after taste in my mouth that would not go away. I used it only 3 times and had to stop because it ruined my taste buds and made my food taste salty and metallic  It took 4 days for that to go away.  I&#x27;m not willing to sacrifice taste for fresh breath.  There has to be something better out there.  I threw it away and will continue to look for a better product. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I have tried the toothpaste and oral rinse for a few days now.  Someone covered up their nose as I was speaking with them just an hour after using this. It&#x27;s very disappointing after all that I have read about this product. By the way, Oxyfresh does not work either.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as she HAD halitosis was very noticeable.  I&#x27;d never heard of tonsil stones before, as I don&#x27;t have tonsils, but she did and they were there.  A few treatments with this and they were gone and so was her halitosis.  I used it as well and it worked well for keeping my breath fresh throughout the day.  This will be on our regular shopping list from now on.</li>
    <li> This seems to work for my nasal dripping, helping to refreshes my breath. Others similar purchases in the past have not seemed to work but this one seem to work effectively it seems like. Thank you for having it here for purchase and will definitely continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TheraBreath Oral Rinse is very effective. Having used it for some while, has sure proven its effectiveness. As a person with sinus and allergies problems, brushing alone without a mouth rinse such as Therabreath, just does not freshen my breath. Other mouthwashes in the past that I have used, either they dried the inside of mouth, or be irritable, making me to discontinuing using them immediately. As a result, TheraBreath Oral Rinse has become my go to mouthwash, and I am pleased and grateful that it exists for purchases. Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> Better product than their toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I am constantly trying to find ways to keep my mouth clean, anyone who knows me will also say that i try to take good care of my teeth. I always pre wash and than brush for 2 minutes and than post wash. So now onto this product, I tried this product because I wanted to try something new that I have not tried before and read so many reviews that I decided to give it a shot. Pros: no harsh rising when in mouth, there are so many post washes that have so much % of alcohol that they somewhat are painful to try to carry the full 2 minutes recommend in your mouth but this product doesn&#x27;t have any at all. This product does take some of the smell away from your mouth, but I believe that I could not tell any difference when I used and didnt use this product. I know that some products have scented flavors to leave your mouth smelling clean but it only masked the smell but if you DONT CLEAN YOUR TOUNGE than this product makes no difference. This product does help slightly but do not hope that this product is a miracle worker, you have to as well resume proper dental hygiene for this product to work. I would not recommend this as a quick mouth wash before things such as date or rushing to a meeting. Tongue cleaners to always recommended from what i have used. Cons: I always prewash with somethings that helps clean my teeth and whiten (I know some might say thats not healthy but I have consulted with two dentist about the ones i used and amounts and frequency and it is at a good amount) . but when I use this product is will leave the teeth a but yellower ( I&#x27;m sure thats not a word) and does make me feel a bit withdrawn about using this product. So i have now used this product just before bed (when your not keeping your teeth clean and can have some sugars left, maybe) and not using it in the morning. I hope that this helps and not as confusing as it may sound. Please just leave a comment if you have any questions. thanks</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of this product. I didn&#x27;t realize the taste that was left in my mouth was from this until I read other reviews. I noticed something but didn&#x27;t put the two together. I&#x27;m fine with it though because a bad taste to me is way better than bad breath when talking to other people.</li>
    <li> I had been concerned when my husband continually was telling me I had bad breath.  After using this product for just a few days, he no longer was telling me my breath was bad.  Since using this product was the only change I had made, it obviously mean that it was working!  I am continuing to use it and I am very satisfied.  As others have said, though, don&#x27;t expect a minty taste.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to mouth wash for the longest. I&#x27;ve let go of brands such as Listerine simply because of their ineffectiveness in keeping my mouth fresh. This brand still remains on top for me.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my breath smell, and that it doesn&#x27;t burn like most mouthwashes.  The freshness lasts all day</li>
    <li> I recently receive this Katz TheraBreath and I really like it.  It help rid your mouth of bacteria that cause a bad odor in your mouth.  You really need to gargle at least for one-minute.  Remember continue your routine of brushing your teeth and flossing.  I will order this product again!!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s breath smells like a dead camel&#x27;s carcass. She knows it, even though I hope she never reads this. This stuff is the only thing on the market that really works. Just follow the directions and it will get rid of any awful stink. The stuff is expensive for the small amount that you get, but you gotta get something that really works.</li>
    <li> I like this mouthwahsh, it seems very clean and simple. The Ph is one of the highest out there so it is great for sensitive teeth. Great compliment to the Zellies protocol as well.</li>
    <li> I like this mouthwash and have recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> Man, what have i been missing while using products like Listerine and Scope?! This stuff is amazing! the light minty flavor is exactly that &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; you don&#x27;t feel overwhelmed when you are finished. My breath smells great in the morning, i even get morning smooches from the SO without complaint! there is zero burn and no discomforting side effects. a million stars!</li>
    <li> I used to believe that bad breath came from the digestive system but i was wrong. A friend told me about this oral rinse and I decided to try it. I live in Brasil, so with the taxes i payed twice the price. But It worthy.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Mild mint. I have used this for 1 week and decided I should definitely give it a review. I have a bunch of old silver fillings that I need to have replaced with the ceramic filling they use now. I also have 3 crowns. So those things combined lead to a very strange odor in my mouth. And my mouth tastes like crap in the mornings. But since I started this last week, the odor is gone and it literally works all day for me. I haven&#x27;t tried skipping a day but I don&#x27;t plan on it either. The mild mint really doesn&#x27;t have a taste at all. When you spit it out there is a very, very faint hint of mint. But it doesn&#x27;t burn, it does the job. And with subscribe and save, you can&#x27;t beat it. You definitely get what you pay for with this mouthwash. I will not buy ACT or listerine again, ever.</li>
    <li> Aweasome stuff, leaves your mouth feeling super clean. Works way better then scope or listerine. If you follow the instructions they give you on how to use the product it works even better. I&#x27;ve used it with the therabreath tooth paste and a regular one too, I think it works a little better with the therabreath one, but it still works very well with regular toothpaste. Just make sure to do the flossing between the teeth as recomended in the instructions.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I&#x27;ve been using it for couple of months now.  I no longer need to chew gum (doesn&#x27;t help) to mask my bad breath.  I highly recommend people giving it a try even if you purchase one bottle from local stores.</li>
    <li> I suffer from occasional tonsil stones.  Sometimes they get so bad that I can taste the odor in the back of my mouth.  After living in constant fear that people were disgusted by my breath I found this product.  Since using I have not tasted the tonsil stones or any other bad odors in my mouth.  Even in the morning when I wake up my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel nasty like it normally does.  After 4 or 5 days of using a massive tonsil stone came out one day while I was gargling.  This is the only tonsil stone that it has \\&quot;removed\\&quot; but I do feel like it does a good job regardless.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. I used to get comments from loved ones, but after using this for a while the comments stopped, and when I asked directly, I was told that my breath has been fine. It doesn&#x27;t burn like alcohol based mouthwashes, but it&#x27;s still fairly astringent (probably the minty essential oil in the ingredients). Currently using it in tandem with the SLS-free, flouride toothpaste of the same brand, though not the &amp;#34;fresh breath&amp;#34; version of the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> The product in general works as advertised ( does help with breath) I have used it for a few weeks and noticed as far as my tonsil stones go it does minimize them as long as I constantly use the product. I tried a little extra technique to see if it will help ( I use a plastic syringe to squirt some * a few drops * in the crevices where the tonsils stones hide ) and noticed it help&#x27;s the dislodge * with a few coughs* to loosen.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying the product again I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
    <li> There are lots of causes for dry mouth with nearly no solutions for the problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, my &#x27;dry mouth&#x27; was a precursor to my adult-onset diabetes diagnosis. When blood sugar is high or not controlled, the health of your mouth is the first outward sign letting you know that something could be up with your health.  Dry mouths are harbors for sulfur-producing bacteria causing bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at my wit&#x27;s end trying to find a solution for this. I somehow stumbled upon Therabreath, a company that creates multiple products to solve this frustrating problem. Their oral products contain an oxygenating formula that destroys the sulfur-causing bacteria neutralizing odors and is naturally moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you rinse with the Therabreath Oral Rinse, your mouth will instantly feel refreshed and healthy reversing your dry mouth. I tried this one time before becoming hooked for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therabreath makes a multitude of products including a toothpaste without the drying ingredient &#x27;sodium lauryl sulfate&#x27; that is found in ALL toothpastes out on the market - Any toothpaste with this ingredient will make your condition worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed! This is a BEST SELLER on Amazon!</li>
    <li> wonderful products, love it</li>
    <li> Does the job like no other mouthwash!</li>
    <li> Thera Breath does just as it claims. Bad breath is gone immediately after using it. Does not last all day unfortunately but nothing is perfect. tastes fine, although there is a slight after taste eat or drink something and you wont notice it. if you are waiting for the miracle pill its never going to come. This is definetely the best thing out there that i have found. The Bottles will last a long time, money well spent.</li>
    <li> At last something that really works!  I bought it not only for myself but for my daughter.  She has bad breath problems, yet her teeth and gums are perfect.  I knew it was coming from the back of the throat because you could really smell it when she whispered, so I would especially notice it Sunday mornings in church. I knew she had just brushed a half hour earlier, yet there was still odor.  When she uses this, her breath is perfect!  As some reviewers have stated, you&#x27;re not going to use this and feel like you&#x27;ve used some strong, minty breath freshener.  This truly cleans your throat and doesn&#x27;t just mask odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that using a capful is too much for me as it does bubble up quickly once you start gargling.  Half a cap seems to be just fine for me.  I have one of these in every bathroom.  It is more expensive, but worth every penny. I have found it at Target for a cheaper price, but it was on clearance.  I don&#x27;t know if they still sell it.  Amazon&#x27;s price is definitely cheaper than the pharmacies I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> If you have tonsil stones, use this.&lt;br /&gt;If you get throat infections and throat colds, use this.&lt;br /&gt;If you have bad breath, use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This had become a permanent part of my life. I know its a lot of money but buy it once. Just take the chance, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to buy don&#x27;t do some sissy mouth swish... Tilt your head and gargle getting the wash as far back into your throat as you can, this is where your sinus drainage and tonsils are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a chance and improve your life.</li>
    <li> So I have been using the other products such as the toothpaste, the throat spray, the nasal stuff and the other mouth rinse given with the tonsil stone kit. The tonsil stone kit did seem to help a little. That mouth rinse, composed of regular water and a tablet or two that came with the kit seems to work at dislodging the stones already present. It did not freshen my breath though. I heard so many good things about the oral rinse that I figured I might as well try it. I thought that perhaps it would dislodge and keep the stones at bay while freshening my breath. That wasn&#x27;t quite the case. In fact, it makes my mouth reeeeeally fresh for a very short while and then after that point everything tastes funny. No joke. Water tastes weird and some foods even burn my tongue after I&#x27;ve gargled (I do wait a long time before eating again, don&#x27;t worry I follow the directions). I love the way it tastes, don&#x27;t get me wrong, and I also love that it&#x27;s natural but if it makes water taste weird no matter if it&#x27;s from a bottle or from the tap I can&#x27;t really use it. It&#x27;s too expensive and if you try gargling with it it&#x27;s an utter nightmare. I would reeeally like if he developed a formula that would foam up and nearly choke a person while gargling. That is my biggest problem with it. So, I like the flavor, it freshens my breath (for a time) but it messes with my taste buds and is impossible to gargle (which seems very important in keeping those stones at bay, or at least that is what I&#x27;ve found).</li>
    <li> I suffer greatly from dry mouth as a side effect of my medications.  It became so bad, I almost decided to stop my lifesaving medications!  Instead, I shopped for help in this area.  I ordered the TheraBreath Mouth Wetting Lozenges.  I was so excited to have a solution - sometimes I cannot even speak properly due to dry mouth.  Ok, the review: I found that the lozenges work minimally, not that great, but helped a little.  I did not like the after-taste, and it t must have some kind of sugar as I can tell immediately as in diet soda vs regular soda.  That sugary aftertaste was annoying. And a big dislike about this product is the packaging!  The lozenges are tiny and wrapped in clear plastic.  I am getting on in years, and have less manual dexterity.  I could not open the tiny package of the lozenges, and had to use my teeth or a scissor to open.  Not cool while I am at work to take my teeth and slash open a lozenge or struggle with opening.  I would not buy this product again for the above reasons.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perhaps I should have tried the therabreath icy flavor.  This stuff is NASTY!  Barely kept it in my mouth as I kept gagging.  I seriously have never tasted anything this gross.  For hours afterward, I could had a taste in my mouth that the best thing I can think to compare it to is if I swished around in my moutn and gargled raw, perhaps slightly spoiled, mollusk slime.  Seriously.  Gross!  I will update this if I can get used to it.  If anyone else has experience with this product and perhaps you think there is something wrong with mine. Please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it two stars because it did keep other bad tastes out of my mouth (and so I assume breath).  But perhaps it just masked them with the nasty flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously used breathrx which was a bit more expensive/ounce, but I don&#x27;t think it takes near as much so therabreath is actually probably more expensive if used as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have two bottles of this stuff to try and gag my way through.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, my entire mouth is much healthier, in addition to improving breath.</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash on the market...  makes your mouth feel very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Not too much to say except that it really does work. Very mild flavor. Very lasting effects. Really does prevent morning breath.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash doesn&#x27;t leave a strong mint taste in your mouth.  Instead it just removes the bad breath.  I think it works quite well, especially if you rinse/gargle with it for a minute or so.  If you&#x27;re looking for a mouthwash to just swish around for a few seconds and walk away with fresh minty breath, this is probably not for you.  If you want something that you don&#x27;t mind swishing around for a while that will remove the bad breath without really leaving a particularly strong taste of its own, this is it.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from large tonsils, post nasal drip and he has tonsil stones (tonsilloliths). The combination of these have caused him to have constant bad breath.  I have researched many things and came across TheraBreath Oral Rinse.  I read the reviews and just like many others I was skeptical.  But I am here to tell you that it works!  I could tell a difference even after the first treatment.  By day two the bad breath was totally gone!!  I would recommend this product to anyone that suffers from constant bad breath.</li>
    <li> This was just recommended by a friend. Although I did not really have a big problem with bad breath, I did have occassional bouts with it specially when I eat certain types of food or drink coffee. What intrigued me was my friend saying it will remove bad morning breath which I could not believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoa and behold, it did work. Your breath in the morning will not be minty and fresh but there is absolutely no odor. Its like something neutral. If this is possible then it works wonders during the day without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There instructions say a capful twice a day. I actually use only 2/3 of capfull and only every morning and it works fine. This means that people with bigger breath problems could do it twice or maybe try some of the other Dr. Katz product along with this like the toothpaste if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to gargle 1.5 minutes minimum as recommended. I tried shorter than that and sometimes it does not work as well...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have always been told my breathe stinks no matter what I tried and the denist always said everything looks fine. I start using this rinse and everybody is telling me how good my breath smells even after eating onions.</li>
    <li> It works! That would be enough said, but Amazon requires more to meet the word count. This product leaves a clean clear taste in your mouth without the sweetness or burn of other brands. It&#x27;s become a go to product for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. It will neutralize bad breath in about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> It works.  It&#x27;s not very minty, but it does eliminate bad breath.  The TheraBreath mints on the other hand are VERY minty.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I feel like we&#x27;ve finally discovered the cure for bad breath.  Not only does my mouth stay fresh all day, but I can even eat candy without getting coated teeth.  I struggle with tonsil stones too, and this really has taken care of that.  It even seems to lessen morning breath (doesn&#x27;t eliminate it completely, but it definitely helps).  My mouth did taste a bit metallic for the first couple days of using it, but after a couple days that completely went away.  I also like the toothpaste.  EDIT:  I found some tonsil stones today, so I guess it doesn&#x27;t eliminate them.  But it does really seem to neutralize the odor - I couldn&#x27;t taste them like I usually can.  EDIT:  It&#x27;s been around six months since my last edit, and I haven&#x27;t had any tonsil stones since.  I usually get them much more often than that, so the mouthwash does seem to help.  I don&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mouthwash almost 3 months now and it works extremely well. It cleared up my tonsil stones (and therefore my bad breath) almost instantly, which made my life much more pleasant. However, after about 2 months I began to experience very dry, chapped lips on the inside and edges of my mouth. It&#x27;s almost as if the inside of my lips have been rubbed raw; any acidic or alcoholic food or beverage causes a burning sensation when it touches my lips. I stopped using the mouthwash for a few days to see if it really was the cause of my dry lips, and my lips did start to feel better, but then my tonsil stones and bad breath came back without the mouthwash to fight them off. I now feel dependent on this mouthwash to keep my tonsils clear, but I&#x27;m worried that means I will have dry, irritated lips for the rest of my life. Overall, dry lips are better to deal with than tonsil stones, so I will continue to use the product. And it really does do what is advertises to it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> Does what is supposed to do, hence the 2 star rating, but created many sores in my mouth. It also left a green tint on my tongue that took a good week to go away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifelong sufferer of sinus problems and fairly obnoxious morning-breath.  No, seriously... we&#x27;re talking about the smell of a dumpster behind a fast food restaurant during an August heat-wave.  After using this stuff for 2 days, my morning breath is gone and my mouth &amp; throat don&#x27;t feel like sub-Saharan Africa when I wake up. In all seriousness, this stuff is amazing.  If the price seems a little steep to you, think about all the money you&#x27;ve wasted on crap that didn&#x27;t work...</li>
    <li> Ok wish It was not so high in price or just maybe a larger bottle sent quick boxed up tight</li>
    <li> Thera breath is the most wonderful mouthwash(not the normal alcoholic one) i have ever used in my life. Like other mouthwashes it doesnt contain alcohol, so no more burning sensation in the mouth. It tastes more or less like water with a mild mint flavor. People complained they lose taste after using this mouthwash. But i have no issues so far. It works like a charm and stops your bad breath forever by not masking the bad breath, rather reduces the sulphur components by its oxygenating formula. I dont know how it stops bad breath instantly. Thanks to the oxygenation process rather than the masking of bad breath. Only a small amount of therabreath is needed for a single rinse, so the two bottles will last more than 2 months atleast for me as i use it only once a day. I think a single dose of rinse per day is enough for average bad breathers (like me!). All i can say is that its a most value for money product. Thank you Thera Breath.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t burn, isn&#x27;t overpoweringly strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently discovered I have tonsil stones and they are a NIGHTMARE. I have a chronic low grade sore throat from them. I read up about treatments and found myself directed to this product. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a week. At first I didn&#x27;t see any changes in the amount of stones, but I was only gargling for about 30 seconds. This time around though I gargled for about a minute and when I spit it out, sure enough a tonsil stone went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found my bottle at Walmart for around $8. Far more convenient than purchasing it online and is around the same price. They also have the toothpaste for about $4.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 6 year old daughter. She has an odor in her mouth and we found this and decided to give it  a try. We also use tongue scraper along with the mouth rinse and my wife and I both agree that it is helping with her bad breath.</li>
    <li> It really is superior to others like Listerine and Scope</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all of the amazing reviews I read on here. I have great dental hygiene (floss every day, brush at least 2x a day, and use mouthwash), but my breath still smelled horrible even after I had just brushed/flossed/used mouthwash. It turned out to be tonsil stones from my constant allergies. I&#x27;d been struggling with this for months, and it was absolutely ruining my life. I was considering asking my doctor for a tonsillectomy just to end the madness. I decided to give this product a shot, and I was absolutely SHOCKED at how amazing it works! After using the mouthwash, my breath felt fresh and incredible. Even after the minty scent wore off, my breath didn&#x27;t smell at all. It seriously kills EVERY smell coming out of your mouth. Once you eat, that&#x27;s a bit of a different story, but your breath still won&#x27;t smell as horrible as it did before. One thing I will say though, is that it DOES NOT remove your tonsil stones (at least it hasn&#x27;t removed mine). I still see them in my tonsils, but they aren&#x27;t as gross-looking as they were before, AND they don&#x27;t smell anymore. Because I&#x27;m not struggling with the smell, I don&#x27;t feel the urge to take them out. I just leave them alone, and I feel a ton better. BUY THIS PRODUCT! YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - I have only been using this for about a week now, and I&#x27;m already 80% of the way done with one of the bottles, and I rinse twice a day as recommended. Be very thrifty with it, as it is expensive and empties quickly.</li>
    <li> This smelled awful when I used it as a mouth wash. I was expecting that it will be a refreshing mouth wash, something like Crest or Colgate.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good price. Arrived in excellent shape.</li>
    <li> Along with Dr Katz toothpaste, this is the best mouthwash I have tried yet that keeps my breath smelling sweet, fresh, and clean for a long time!</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash I have found to date.&lt;br /&gt;Very &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; tasting, and unlike many of the harsh products on the market.</li>
    <li> Some history:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been religious about dental care, always flossing 1-2 times a day, and brushing 2-3 times a day. My dentist says my teeth are perfect. However, I&#x27;ve always had gum issues, and ever since puberty, I&#x27;ve had bad breath/dry mouth. I can literally drink a glass of water and my mouth is bone dry 60 seconds later. My breath is good for about 30 minutes after brushing, then it turns bad again. I&#x27;m sure it has to do with diet or some such, but nothing seemed to change it. Other mouthwashes seem to suppress it for about an hour or so, but then it returns. This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried where my breath is good for the first 1-2 hours, decent for about 3-4 hours, and almost normal for the rest of the day. I&#x27;ve only been using it 2x a day, and it&#x27;s helped tremendously. I hope it is safe for long term use, because I plan on using it perpetually.</li>
    <li> This product is girlfriend approved!  Doesn&#x27;t have the expected mint, or other flavor you&#x27;d expect.  Perhaps those flavors mask the breath while Dr Katz gets the source.</li>
    <li> Awsome product, works on the baddest breath i&#x27;ve ever smelled, i&#x27;m not kidding!  Combined with saline spray in the nose and this breath rinse and spray, oh i&#x27;m SAVED from my mate, whew!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good stuff. But my purpose was my tonsil stones, it didn&#x27;t help to remove them (as I read before in many reviews). But the product itself is very good.</li>
    <li> This is a highly over-rated product. It pretty much taste like salty water and is 30% more pricy than other existing mouth washes on Amazon. I did buy it once and didn&#x27;t find it as different compared to other mouth washes. In fact, you purely feel the salty water taste which you can make at home for free! Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> It has the same thickness as biotene and also helps with dry mouth. Flavor is sort of peppermint. Product recommends to use in combination with their toothpaste and tongue brushing and/or scraping.</li>
    <li> THIS MOUTHWASH IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS AND IT REALLY DOES WORK.  IT IS WELL WORTH YOUR MONEY.  I USE IT A COUPLE OF TIMES PER DAY, PREDOMINANTLY AFTER EATING, AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL HOW CLEAN YOUR MOUTH IS ALONG WITH CONTINUED FRESH BREATH.  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY WITH THIS PRODUCT.  IT ALSO KEEPS YOUR BREATH FRESH FOR MANY HOURS; A CLEAN YOU CAN FEEL.  THE SAME COMPANY MAKES A TOOTHPASTE WHICH IS EXCELLENT AS WELL.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  DR. J.</li>
    <li> I have had an absolutely disgusting taste in the back of my mouth and throat for years. I&#x27;ve also had really bad breath - it&#x27;s obvious. I could smell it myself, and others would back away from me when I spoke.  No amount of brushing, flossing or rinsing was helping except for about 15 minutes.  It&#x27;s been horrible.  I just received my shipment of Therabreath today and I tried it immediately.  I brushed first, then thoroughly gargled.  I am FLOORED.  It has been about 6 hours since I rinsed and I still do not have the vile taste in my mouth/throat that I know has been responsible for my nasty breath for so long now.  Again, I am floored.  The only downside is that my mouth feels irritated and my throat is sore.  But I will deal with those things if it means no more nasty taste/breath.  I&#x27;m hoping these side-effects will be short lived and I will go on enjoying the amazing gift of fresh breath.  I&#x27;m telling you, I thought NOTHING would ever work for me.  I am really impressed and really grateful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - after using this stuff for awhile, the side-effects did not improve, and the irritation led to a lot of mucus production in my throat. That became as bad as the bad taste/bad breath, so like with everything else I&#x27;ve tried, this has not been a long-lasting solution for me. It&#x27;s a bummer.</li>
    <li> The mouthwash works as they describe - you get fresh feeling and it lasts. I have noticed that if you rinse longer than 15-20 seconds you do get a slight change of taste for the following hour or so - not bad, just things taste a bit different. Not much of a bother but worth mentioning. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> It might very well do a great job, but the effect is lost because of the objectionable taste of the Rinse.  It left a disagreeable taste in my mouth after each use.</li>
    <li> ¹≠My dogs have dog breath.  Eww.  Worse,  my son and husband rival the dogs in peeeyew factor.  We tried Threrabreath and have noticed no more human dog breath.  It doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor,  maybe a very clean, light mint.  now we buy it on scheduled delivery so as not to run out.  No alcohol burn, no drying out of the mouth.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Product works. Even the morning bad breath is remarkably reduced, if not totally eliminated. Im rotating this with Breath Rx and ACT, but I favor this more for its [confirmed] no-sting formula.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is it is very expensive. I dont know what special ingredient, proprietary technology, or special processing that warrants its premium price. I hope that the manufacturers mass produce it soon to make it more affordable.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Mild Mint&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of impact in treating bad breath. It is almost scent free itself.</li>
    <li> Gentle, effective, no bad taste. Convenient measuring cup fits inside the outer cap. Not sure there is more to say than that. Would I buy again? Yes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this stuff works so well, but it does.  And it lasts a whole day!  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband suffered for years with chronic gingivitis and the resulting bad breath.  I bought this mouthwash one day basically on a whim several years ago and we both could tell the difference his first week of using it.  Then I bought the toothpaste and that helped even more.  I use it myself every night and I don&#x27;t wake up with &amp;#34;sewer mouth&amp;#34; in the morning.  I&#x27;m never without it and actually get it with Amazon&#x27;s subscription so that I don&#x27;t worry about finding myself with an empty bottle and no replacement.</li>
    <li> Awesome product&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t wake up with green fumes coming out of your mouth  ... lol&lt;br /&gt;It has a very faint minty taste,not too strong....you are supposed to gargle for a full minute..&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more,because it works!!</li>
    <li> This is a good mouth wash it makes your mouth feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is the after taste in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always amazed how clean and fresh my mouth is after using such a mild tasting mouthwash. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this item and that it comes in a 2-pack!</li>
    <li> Does what it says: gets rid of bad breath.  You only need to use a small amount; much less than the directions state.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s really a great product</li>
    <li> If you suffer from bad taste in your mouth or bad breath from post-nasal drip, THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT WILL WORK! The only thing I ever found anyway. This product neutralizes the bacteria in your mouth from post-nasal drip. So many suffer from this and do not know why. It is not anything to do with your oral hygiene. DO read the instructions and follow them, and it WILL work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from bad breath from bad oral hygiene, then no, this product will not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, this is one of those rare products that actually works!</li>
    <li> LIFE CHANGING.  This is the BEST thing ever. Dr. Katz explains the science behind oral hygiene. Volatile Sulfur Compounds-- after all of the pastes, gums, and rinses I&#x27;ve used through the years-- loaded with alcohols, soaps, and sugars--all I had to do was oxygenate and avoid these 3 things. I always wondered why coffee, dairy, and alcohol seemed to &amp;#34; sour&amp;#34; in my mouth immediately after consuming. I reviewed his website and now I know...now, how to tell others about it who need it?</li>
    <li> I like this mouthwash.  It isnt too overpowering and does the job.</li>
    <li> Great product, no alcohol, no burning sensation when using this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Worked very well! Good minty taste!</li>
    <li> Though more expensive than Listerine and other brands, the Therabreath oral rinse is the best mouthwash available. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, and it consistently keeps my mouth clean and fresh. Other mouthwashes (especially the alcohol based ones) not only burn but also eventually leave a sickly sugary taste after a while. Therabreath not only doesn&#x27;t do that, but it keeps your mouth feeling taste and scent free for a long time. For me, it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I am on my fourth bottle of TheraBreath oral rinse.  I&#x27;ve also tried the TheraBreath toothpaste and mints, because I was initially so impressed by the oral rinse. I cannot rate this with 5 stars however, because I acknowledge what many other reviewers have already stated, that it affects how water tastes for a few hours afterward.  I have not noticed this so much as a metallic flavor, as others have said, but more like baking soda. It feels as if the oral rinse makes my mouth very alkaline and thereby negatively affects how things taste.  However, the rinse does make my mouth feel clean and fresh and not dry.  I have determined to simply use it less frequently.  I can only theorize that the reason there are such polarized reviews for this product on Amazon is that it works relative to the pH balance of the person using it. So perhaps for those who really need it, it is very effective.  And for those who have different body chemistry, the rinse is overkill and leaves them with a metallic aftertaste or sore throat?  For what it&#x27;s worth, even with the unpleasant effect afterward, I have continued to use this rinse.  And I have never experienced an allergic reaction or sore throat.  The rinse is very plain; it almost feels as if you&#x27;re rinsing with water. There is no strong, discernible flavor. But it seems to be effective at freshening breath.</li>
    <li> Way better than any breath wash I have used in the past I am a huge fan of this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this mouth wash.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste like mouthwash.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I keep a bottle of this at work because I have always had trouble gargling with anything in the morning without feeling like I will gag or vomit. Weird, I know. But, typically around 10 or 11 am I start to &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; my bad breath in the back of my throat from my tonsil stones &amp; I will also have a thick mucus feeling with a sour taste in the back of my throat. The ONLY thing that helps get rid of that is gargling with this rinse! It works like a charm every time &amp; has helped clear up my frequent sore throat from post nasal drip also. I haven&#x27;t noticed it getting rid of my tonsil stones completely but I can&#x27;t see them anymore, so maybe if I get on a more regular regimen twice a day, that will help more.</li>
    <li> I have been using the TheraBreath Oral Rinse and the other TheraBreath products for four months. It is great to find a product that stops bad breath and leaves a nice mint taste. I&#x27;m glad I heard about TheraBreath.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on reviews.  I have been very impressed.  Almost no taste, certainly no aftertaste, but surprisingly effective.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember how we found out about Therabreath, but so glad we did. My husband had bad breath that regular mouth wash was not working for.  This product works to rid the tongue of those sulfur compounds that end up living on your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;  Bad breath is caused by the excretion of the anaerobic bacteria that live within your mouth. These anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that do not need oxygen to survive) excrete sulfur compounds. These sulfur compounds ignite the bad-breath brushfire. The rotten egg smell (hydrogen sulfide) and the barnyard smell (methyl mercaptan) are known as VSCs  – volatile sulfur compounds. The key word here is volatile.&lt;br /&gt;  So you treat it with this alcohol free mouthwash. Yes it costs more than average mouth wash, BUT.. having fresh breath is worth it for yourself and for those that have to smell the bad breath, that was ME.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses the tongue scraper along with the mouth wash on most days. If he slips and does not use it I can tell , and I remind him to use it.  Don&#x27;t forget to take it on vacation!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product with those of you with BAD breath.&lt;br /&gt;He has used it for many years, and I make sure he does NOT run out.</li>
    <li> Great product, great taste, works as advertised.  I use in conjunction with lozenges and paste.  I am on two prescription drugs that dry my mouth out and it has been a constant battle.  Will reorder!</li>
    <li> I have had a difficult time with halitosis most of my life.  We found this about 7 years ago and its the only thing that works.  It seems to work better with the toothpaste, but I use it alone and that is good enough.  Some of the comments suggest bad taste in peoples mouth, and different people may experience different side effects.  I have experienced none and swear by this product.  It is also less expensive online then trying to buy it in the store.  I am a loyal customer at this point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reading everyone else&#x27;s reviews and I&#x27;m happy to hear that it works for most people, even though I find it hard to believe after trying this product. I bought this product because my mother and wife noticed I had bad breath. After seeing a dentist and an oral hygienist and having my teeth cleaned, I was cleared that my gums and teeth were healthy, but could not figure out where the bad breath was coming from. Most mouthwashes would mask the smell temporarily but my bad breath would come back within hours, minutes perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this product, I noticed that it gives a clean, oxygenating sensation to my mouth and really made my breath fresh. Unfortunately, it would not last very long. If this product works for you, then you probably don&#x27;t have really bad halitosis, so good for you! As for me, I will have to keep searching for a product that really is effective for whatever it is that I have.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was a little bit on the pricey side. But for the result that I have it&#x27;s money well spent. I would recommend to everyone that is very conscience about their breath. This stuff proceed by the Tongue cleaner gel works wonders.</li>
    <li> This product did better than expected. We use it every morning and evening and the taste in our mouth is gone. We can&#x27;t even smell each other&#x27;s breath at all!! This product is extraordinary and we will be purchasing more in the future!! I reccommend this product to anyone with bad breath.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the other products in the line.  This product by itself is a miracle.  It tastes great, so even my little kids can use it versus \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; mouthwashes out there.  A small sip, gargled and swished around the mouth for about 45 seconds, every morning, and no one has complained of my breath for many months.  I didn&#x27;t have TERRIBLE breath before, but would occasionally get a grimace from those who loved me, especially my children.  It&#x27;s not super cheap, but worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a word of advice:  this guy sells a ton of products.  We used the toothpaste for about 6 months, but honestly, it tastes strange, is really really expensive, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth tasting as clean as the commercial toothpastes he hates.  My recommendation would be to get the mouthwash, continue with your regular toothpaste for the first 2-3 weeks, and just see if the mouthwash alone kills the bad breath.  For minor cases, it probably will.  If it doesn&#x27;t, then step it up and order the other products, especially the toothpaste.  If that solves it then, you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s worth it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see any reason why my whole family won&#x27;t continue to use this mouthwash for the next decade or more.  It&#x27;s really that great of a product.</li>
    <li> This is just fantastic. I no longer have any kind of bad breath. It&#x27;s just neutral. I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but your breath smells like nothing-not minty, not bad, just neutral. The most amazing thing about is that if you use it at night (rinse and gargle), you have ZERO smell in the morning. Again, your breath smells like nothing/tastes like nothing. It&#x27;s so good that if I gargle with it at night and don&#x27;t do it in the morning, I&#x27;ve found that I can go the entire next day without any kind of breath problems. I wish they made this in a bigger sized bottle as it goes pretty fast. I&#x27;ll definitely keep repurchasing though. It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
    <li> I suffer from tonsil stones as soon as my allergies flare up.  Gargling with this twice a day put a stop to them.  And I am grateful for that.</li>
    <li> Overall, the product really didn&#x27;t seem to do much. Seems like a bunch of pseudo scientific garbage, wrapped up in a nice package to make it seem worthwhile. Too pricey, not good enough. Standard mouthwash is fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week now. I no longer have any morning breath or bad taste in my mouth. I recommend using this with a tongue cleaner, and you should be good to go!</li>
    <li> sounds good, I will try more times, hope it is useful</li>
    <li> Just working on my first bottle and it seems to work pretty well.  It&#x27;s just hard to judge yourself when you have bad breath.</li>
    <li> Works great, never going back to regular mouthwash.  Have it on monthly re-order.</li>
    <li> Although other products is stronger but wont last&lt;br /&gt;This mouth wash is not strong at all but last more and affected more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with other products from the same brand as toothpaste and candy and the spray.</li>
    <li> The only reason this item has good reviews is because of the &amp;#34;free offer&amp;#34; company gives to people that leave reviews.  I bet 99% of positive reviewers left them before they ever tried it.  This product leaves after taste for the rest of the day, nothing and I mean NOTHING taste good after you rinse your mouth with this in the morning.  Anything from sweet tea tasting like piss water to any food. Only extra spicy food can overcome the aftertaste of this mouthwash.  Garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it served the purpose it&#x27;s intended.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it to friends with bad breath of any magnitude.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, except you get some chap lips. I never had it previous, but I do now.</li>
    <li> I first came across this particular Brand at my Dentist&#x27;s Office and tried it because other mouthwash always burned the inside of my mouth. Even when it didn&#x27;t feel like it was burning, the Hygienist at the Dentist Office told me that was what was happening. I absolutely love this brand. It cleans my mouth, teeth and breathe with No burning! This is the Only Brand of Mouthwash I&#x27;ll ever use! So glad I found it here at Amazon since it&#x27;s much cheaper than at the Dentist!</li>
    <li> Not sure what is in it, but it works great!  My wife loves it.  Says her mouth is fresh in the morning.  I like it too.  Not all minty tasting, but it does take away the yuck mouth.</li>
    <li> I was suffering bad breathe for more than 3 years now, until I find this product. This is a life saver. Yes, as some negative reviews pointed out, I did experience sore throat on my first week of using this product but it was gone after that, not sure why though. The point is my bad breathe has finally under control, this won&#x27;t cure it but at least I can contain it so it won&#x27;t affect my social and personal life. I will continue using it until I find a ultimate cure to the bad breathe.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. However, the product does not keep breath fresh for as long as it claims: 12 hours. If we&#x27;re being honest, it kept my breath fresh for about two hours. The one pro, is that there is no strong alcohol bite to this mouthwash, therefore you can swish it around for a while in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I would simply say few words. If you are having a halitosis issue  and have been trying many products to get rid of that, then this would definitely be what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I have been having halitosis for years and I have tried many products including other TheraBreath mouthwash without a result. However, upon using this magic product for few days, I started to feel Normal and Fresh again with full confidence when talking to someone so close.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Dr. Katz for saving my life.</li>
    <li> I hate normal mouthwash. This has almost no taste and totally gets rid of my dry mouth issues. WELL worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice a day while undergoing chemotherapy.  It prevented mouth sores, kept my mouth in good shape the entire time...and I was on some strong stuff.  A pharmacist had mentioned it to me.</li>
    <li> i use this and the toothpaste and i can say that i am very pleased,i use to suffer from bad breath and it was very imbrasing and because of this i would push away my husband when he try to kiss me but now i can kiss him anytime of the day and night even in the morning when i get up i dont have morning breath anymore this product is a god sent will be buying it all the time</li>
    <li> Crazy it really works very easy to use doesn&#x27;t burn you can do it anytime, I leave a bottle at work.</li>
    <li> Use with TheraBreath Oxygenating Toothpaste (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7G9E/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_128).  These two with throughout-the-day mouthwashing with TheraBreath Oral Rinse (other non-alcoholic-containing rinses can be used), finally addressed my terrible bad-breath.  If I ever fail in this approach, the bad-breath always returns.  I&#x27;ve tried separating the two Dr. Katz products but never with a successful result.</li>
    <li> great product . not burn at all and the flavor is light mint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works just fine to me .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get this .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various oral rinses over the years and this product exceeds them all! I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and happy that I no longer have to bear the burning sensation of other rinses.</li>
    <li> My mom told me about this mouthwash. I struggle with bad breath, especially when I&#x27;m dehydrated. It definately eminates from the back of my tongue / throat, which is hard to manage. I&#x27;ve tried to keep up with other mouthwashes, but even the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; ones burned. This one doesn&#x27;t have any burn, and the mint is not overpowering. I&#x27;m trying to remember to use it at night before bed, and in the morning after breakfast. I believe this combined with brushing the back of my tougue (along with the usual brushing and flossing, of course) is helping keep my breath in check. Now if I could just get in the habit of drinking more water!</li>
    <li> It really works. Great mint taste. I daily use it after brush my teeth with the TheraBreath Toothpaste. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has severe allergies and a constant postnasal drip.  We suspected this was the cause of, or at least a contributing factor to, his bad breath.  He used it one morning and then that night and the next day---no morning breath whatsoever!  We couldn&#x27;t believe it.  He also has had issues with tonsil stones in the morning, yet none since he began using this mouth wash.  I have started using it, too, because it&#x27;s so nice waking up with no morning breath.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first to try this product. Sometimes I don&#x27;t trust a product that gets 5 star ratings all the time!&lt;br /&gt;After doing a bunch of research, I decided to give both the rinse and toothpaste a try. It is well worth the price and works really  well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had bad breath for over a year now and just recently discovered the reason was tonsil stones. As I researched these stones, TheraBreath kept popping up as a method to combat both bad breath and tonsil stones.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does work. Both my partner and I are extremely pleased and relieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bland taste is the only con but you have to realize there is no &#x27;junk&#x27; in these products as opposed to regular commercial dental products.</li>
    <li> A friend recommend this on Amazon, I gave it a try, what an amazing product.  This is now an essential in my home, I use this everynight before bed.  I could not believe I&#x27;ve lived this long without it.  I would recommend anyone to give this a try, I have never used any of Dr. Katz products before and I will definitely try the other products in his line.  I feel like I&#x27;ve been cheated all my life with retail store products, they are all crap compared to this!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this. I have tonsil stones and halitosis problems; I&#x27;ve dealt with these almost my whole life. So I was excited to come across this product. I&#x27;ve had it for three days now and have used it once each day. Within about an hour of gargling with it my tonsils get very sore and stay sore for 6 hours or so and then they get better. This has happened each time (3) that I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;m hesitant to keep using it when it makes my throat sore like this, but it did seem to help my bad breath. I was hoping this would be the right thing, but for me I guess my tonsils or throat have some kind of sensitivity to it.</li>
    <li> the most effective mouthwash for removing the smell of tonsil stones. Worked for me and I swear by it. Also cheaper here than at the Dr Katz website, I think.</li>
    <li> I never had a problem with dry mouth at all. The reason i bought it was because of the promise of making your breath better. I&#x27;ve used this for a week now, and every time i use it, my mouth gets dry, and STAYS DRY for several hours. Can&#x27;t comment on how the breath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And good luck trying to gargle the stuff for the recommended time. I tried it, furthest I&#x27;ve got was about 10 seconds before i started to \\&quot;choke\\&quot; for air, in which i automatically gasped for air, and wound up swallowing some of it. I&#x27;ve still got some left in the bottle, i don&#x27;t plan on finishing up. I&#x27;d pour it down the drain, but i&#x27;m afraid it would dry the pipes up and would probably have to buy new pipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my old mouthwash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~edit~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After alternating the dosage, i&#x27;m not getting dry mouth now. I&#x27;ll update later if anything changes</li>
    <li> works great..and last long. I sent my daughter some and she loved it.it&#x27;s really good for people who have close contact with clients/customers.</li>
    <li> Wow. It actually works better than anything I have ever tried. Buy it now.</li>
    <li> TheraBreath says &amp;#34;Gets Rid of Dry Mouth&amp;#34;, I use it multiple times a day and wake up with dry mouth every morning. It tastes horrible, and is very short- lasting. Neither is it very strong, Listerine is stronger.</li>
    <li> It took several weeks to get used to this mouth wash, but it is the only one that works for me. It makes coffee and some foods taste weird for a while, but it&#x27;s worth it for anyone who has serious bad breath.</li>
    <li> This works well but tastes terrible.  You can taste the baking soda.</li>
    <li> There is no other mouthwash that works this well.  Cant understand why Walmart has stopped carrying this product.</li>
    <li> I love  the mints, can&#x27;t say enough good things. This stuff doesn&#x27;t really do it for me though.</li>
    <li> Tried this out of desperation after years of people backing away and covering their nose at times during conversation. Tried everything I could think of before. First day, the wife said that breath was better. second day, she said no problem. Had a little dry feeling for a day or two, now no problem. You also don&#x27;t need to use as much as they say so it ends up costing me half of when I started. Once in the morning after brushing with their toothpaste which I like. I also like the taste and feel of the mouthwash. I realize that part of &amp;#34;our&amp;#34; problem is not drinking enough water to keep your mouth wet so I&#x27;m also better in that regards but the mints they sell are great and keep your mouth feeling clean. I usually have one after lunch or a cup of coffee. It&#x27;s makes such a difference in all parts of my life, definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Good, just not great.</li>
    <li> The only mouthwash my son will tolerate. He doesn&#x27;t like minty flavors, which is disappointing when it comes to mouth health. It really does help with bad breath, and is very mild. If I hadn&#x27;t known any better, I would have assumed it was just plain water.</li>
    <li> This is one product that lived up to its hype.  If you follow the instructions on the bottle it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I was having an issue with halitosis. Tried everything under the sun to get rid of it. Listerine wasnt helping. I found this stuff and it seems to have solved it. It has a very mild mint taste to it.. Almost tastes like water with a hint of mint..</li>
    <li> My mouth is always painfully dry due to a medicine I must take, so brushing my teeth or using mouthwash, even Biotene, can hurt at times.  Using this mouthwash daily night and day keeps my mouth moist, fresh, and pain free.  It has allowed me to do regular oral care without problems.  It is now part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Really good. I love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  That is all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and it leaves my mouth feeling a lot fresher throughout the day. My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it would without it. You have to get a little used to the taste, it is not bad just different. Use it every morning to get me through the day!</li>
    <li> I spent several nights for years trying to research on something which could give me a solution for my Halitosis problem.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Netipot, Waterpik, Listerine, Sugar Free expensive chewing gums and what not.&lt;br /&gt;finally, i came across Dr. Katz website and thought i should give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Initially i ordered 2 Bottles of 16 Oz. and when i used it for the first time, i thought it was a miracle. The freshness lasts 1 complete day for almost 10 Hrs.&lt;br /&gt;I can see a change in my attitude, i feel more confident talking to people.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to stack chewing gums / mints in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another 4 Bottles will send them overseas for a friend who has the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Dr. Katz!</li>
    <li> If you are tired of getting your mouth beat up by listerine only to have bad breath again after the mint smell wears off, this is your new best friend.  I won&#x27;t use another mouth wash again ever.  Actually decreased my morning breath too.  Paired with tongue scraper, try this for halitosis.</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Cheaper than what they are in the store</li>
    <li> We will not use any other mouth wash after trying this. It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth when using it. And after you spit out/rinse, there is a hint of minty flavor but it is not overwhelming nor does it interfere with how foods taste. It helps combat my morning dry mouth too. I&#x27;ve never used a mouth wash that makes my teeth/breath still feel fresh hours later. Pay a little more and get this! It is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> When people say it changed their life -- they aren&#x27;t joking.  Absolutely the best I have ever found and I have been looking for years!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It really works! My husband has been using this since last year and has had great results. No bad breath. Downside is that it is expensive and that you have to be consistent with using it. A tip: you can use a single scant dosage for both rinsing and gargling for it to still work effectively.</li>
    <li> I love that it has no alcohol, artificial flavors or colors, or sweeteners of any kind. It has a fresh minty taste and relieves my very dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product two times, yesterday morning and again last night.  I really wanted to like this product. I don&#x27;t have a terrible breath problem but thought it might be nice to wake up without morning breath.  All day today I have been unable to taste a thing.  Not only that, there is such a terrible taste in my mouth that it&#x27;s causing me to constantly salivate.  Perhaps this is how it helps with dry mouth?  This taste is so horrible that if I could cause myself to vomit I might, just in the hopes that my stomach acids would destroy the taste on the back of my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only one this would happen to?  This could make a great diet product.  I have no desire to eat anything, as it all tastes hideous.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t want to drink anything either.  My morning coffee tasted like a cup of metal shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am praying this horrible taste issue doesn&#x27;t last for too long.  I will not be using this product again.  On the upside, my breath wasn&#x27;t bad upon waking this morning.  So if you have really bad breath and don&#x27;t care about tasting anything, this could be your product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this mouthwash.  I think it did help give fresh breath, but I am not willing to give up enjoying food.  I think there are better options.</li>
    <li> Great natural ingredient list, and I did notice that my hubby&#x27;s breath is much better late into the evening, as the product advertised longer fresh breath though out the day.</li>
    <li> Almost 20 years ago, I happened to see an ad in a magazine for TheraBreath.  At that time I was struggling with chronic bad breath that even made my wife cringe.  I took a chance and ordered the product and have used it ever since.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the positive impact it has had on my life.  I have a simple routine twice a day that takes less than 5 minutes using the tongue scraper, toothpaste, and oral rinse.  Not sure I understand some of the low reviews as I have NEVER had an issue with the taste, ability to taste food, etc.  If you have chronic bad breath, I strongly encourage you to give TheraBreath a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always read that alcohol based mouthwashes are worse off for bad breath because they kill all the bacteria (including the good guys.) This stuff is almost magic--it doesn&#x27;t taste like much when you&#x27;re using it, but it seems to neutralize bad breath odors. I use Therabreath toothpaste too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It is like magic eraser for your breath.</li>
    <li> As a former smoker, I found that most mouth washes fell short to use with my Fluoride Free Toothpaste.  Sure, previous mouthwashes worked for about an hour or so, but the minute I would drink coffee or have anything to eat, I felt like I had to keep mints in my mouth all the time.  I purchased this product a week ago and wanted to give the product a shot to Wow me.  And boy did it! I read about the metallic taste it leaves, I have not experienced it, but then again from being a smoker for almost 30 years, I believe I have a weak palette. The taste is light mint which was definitely a surprise at first as I am used to stronger mouthwashes. But the light mint flavor seems to really pack a powerful punch! I have not experienced any side effects from quitting smoking that I used to.  Like the constant taste of nicotine in my mouth. It seems to have disappeared. Which is such a blessing.  I can taste my food again and not be worried about how my breath is going to be after.  Plus, my teeth seem to be getting lighter and helping my smile become brighter! I love this product and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ask me how, but this stuff really works. It isn&#x27;t the best tasting stuff, but it works. Though, the thing about it not being the best tasting you use, there is no harsh after tastes like other mouth washes. Just fresh breath.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite mouthwash ever. It does prevent morning breath and takes any bacteria out of your mouth leaving you feeling fresh and clean. I go through about 2 bottles a month which is definitely a con but the effects are priceless. Absolutely give this product a try and you won&#x27;t regret it I promise.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  Has a very mild flavor - no burning or alcohol taste like the leading drug store brands. I will definitely reorder this product.</li>
    <li> I can not use any toothpaste or mouthwash, nor eat anything that has mint in it.  This sounded like I might be able to use it, but it&#x27;s claim of very light mint actually was barely less burning that any other mint mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried.  I would send it back, but my spouse should be able to use it.</li>
    <li> so i purchased this product because i was having issues with bad breath. I tried different things (flossing, brushing twice, using different brands of mouthwash), but none of them seemed to work. Luckily, I chanced upon finding this product through Amazon. I ordered it and upon trying it for the firs time, my bad breath almost completely went away. I also bought the toothpaste counterpart. Both of them work really well. For those of you who are struggling with bad breath, I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn and gives a clean feeling,,,,,</li>
    <li> I like the way my mouth feels afterwards, and the my breath is good,  but I&#x27;m not wiling to put up with the taste.</li>
    <li> Keeps my breath fresh for my girlfriend. The taste is kind of plain so don&#x27;t expect something very minty but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The best Mouthwash i ever used.  This product is great especially because there is no stinging taste in your mouth when using it.  Other mouthwash brands like Listerine really sting when using, however the therabreath rinse is smooth, and tastes great.  I feel fresh for hours after use and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I just wish the fresh mint was available when I ordered. Before this product, my husband and I used Listerine, that stuff will burn the HELL out of your mouth in order to get a fresh breath. Say no more to that and hello to healthier gums. Seriously works. Expensive, but worth every pennie.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in the product, good price in any case!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Great price, fast shipping, excellent quality</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Doesn&#x27;t taste bad either.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash has no alcohol, and no candy-like mint taste.  It really does make your mouth feel &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and works on bad breath.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s a bad analogy, but it&#x27;s true.  If you have problems with bad breath, look no further.  This is the only mouth wash you should be using!</li>
    <li> Excellent product...works well...overpriced for what it actually is chemically.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, without the alcohol burn.</li>
    <li> BEST DAMN MOUTH WASH! this flavor doesn&#x27;t burn with menthol, like the others. Absolutely does what it says, eliminates morning breath/dragon breath/poop breath! What ever you wana call it my husband suffered from it! But now in the morning it like.. Nothing. His breath is just...well to be honest kinda hot forth thing in the morning but it doesn&#x27;t stink! I on the other hand suffer from a lot of tonsil stones. &amp; this really seems to help dislodge them from the throat. Since my original perchase I&#x27;ve turned 6 others (family and coworkers) on to this! Definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I had brought this because recently I start getting tonsil stones. After goggling what I could do about them this product was recommended. I haven&#x27;t had a tonsil stone since I started using this product and I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle now. At first I brought this from my local drugstore and it cost $12 and that was quite expensive to me. So I found it here on Amazon for $6 at bottle.</li>
    <li> This thing gave me a sore throat every time I have used it. Used it on 4 separate occasions and it gave me a sore throat every time. Would NEVER recommend this thing to anyone!!! gosh i don&#x27;t know about the bacteria but it sure is killing my throat! The first time I used it I developed a sore throat immediately after and it got so bad, I was sick for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on a separate note, this thing is mostly tasteless and does not burn. the not-burning quality is obviously a good one but the lack of a fresh-mouth \\&quot;mouthwash\\&quot; feeling after using it is not desirable for me.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference immediately when my husband started using this mouthwash.  He doesn&#x27;t have dry mouth so can&#x27;t comment on this product&#x27;s effectiveness there.  But it definitely improves his breath.  I can tell when he skips using this on busy mornings.  When he does use it, it seems to be effective all day long.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but it only work well with the therabreath toothpaste. I have used both for some years and it does work well for dry mouth and bad breath. Amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> Tastes funny, unconventional, but it made my mouth feel clean usually!  I liked it enough, did the job, I prefere mouthwash with alcohol though</li>
    <li> I had no idea that a product like this one was so effective in battling morning breath! It uses no alcohol and is mild in taste.</li>
    <li> No burning. I think it works great.</li>
    <li> Side effect : Sore throat&lt;br /&gt;I am going to return it</li>
    <li> While the rinse is somewhat refreshing, and does not cause the sting that some other mouthwashes do, it does create an unusually dry mouth. Perhaps it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I can barely remember how I found TheraBreath....pretty sure it was an annoying advert constantly asking &amp;#34;Do you suffer from bad breath?&amp;#34;  Well, YES YES I DID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought &#x27;Hmmmmm has someone out there let Amazon know that I have horrible breath? Gahhhh I know I do - yes, it&#x27;s horrible &amp; embarrassing.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried everything - seriously, tongue scrappers, diet, parsley chomping, talked to dentist, blah blah blah about how b/c I work out a lot, I have high key tones - my husband too....and children....all of us were bad breath, active people - brushing our teeth all the time.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No where did I read about toothpaste being a potential culprit - even at Whole Paycheck, just nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was about 1.5 years ago.  Then, I finally just bought the TheraBreath b/c the internet was barraging me about my bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the rinse &amp; the toothpaste &amp; then changed my floss to a tea tree oil dental floss tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it the first time - go out to a movie w/my husband.  Usually 1 hour in to a movie, my breath would be so bad that husband would remark on it &amp; give me a piece of gum (i hate gum).  Then, I&#x27;d tell him to pop a piece too b/c his breath smelled exactly the same - just that gross smell...but, the same smell.  BUT THAT MOVIE....nothing, no remarks about breath or gum popping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We leave said movie &amp; go have a drink.  Then, both of us - at almost the same time - said &#x27;Huh?&#x27;  We were both so surprised that our mouths didn&#x27;t reek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since that moment, we threw out all other toothpastes &amp; follow the Therabreath suggestions for rinsing &amp; brushing.  Oh &amp; we have the mints now too - they are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now...our children use Therabreath, I gave it to my father for a gift - I got a thank you note from my Mom (yeah - his breath was the same horrible ours was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing &#x3D; I remember my grandmother having that same breath.  Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think everyone reacts to traditional toothpaste with the same chemical concoction; but, so many people have it &amp;#34;THE SMELL&amp;#34;.  Seriously, if you have &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34;....don&#x27;t even think - just buy the TBreath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah - this all sounded crazy dramatic; but, it has helped so many things. Says a person who had 30+ years of bad breath (since childhood).  HAD....it&#x27;s gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear TBreath - just thank you.ink everyone reacts to traditional toothpaste with the same chemical concoction; but, so many people have it &amp;#34;THE SMELL&amp;#34;.  Seriously, if you have &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34;....don&#x27;t even think - just buy the TBreath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah - this all sounded crazy dramatic; but, it has helped so many things. Says a person who had 30+ years of bad breath (since childhood).  HAD....it&#x27;s gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear TBreath - just thank you.</li>
    <li> I ran out of the bottle I had and thought &amp;#34;eh, not that important&amp;#34;. A few weeks later I started getting tonsil stones again and remembered why I liked this stuff.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product and a week later I thought I had developed tongue cancer or something! It was so sore and gross looking. I went into the er and was diagnosed with bht. They gave me a b12 shot and folic acid rx assuming my diet was poor due to breast feeding. I got onto Wikipedia and it says right on there that oxygenating mouthwashes can cause this issue. I brush my teeth all he time and use a tongue scraper. Super icky going into the garbage!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mouth wash.</li>
    <li> Stuff is awesome. No harsh bite from alcohol, and does a better job at natural smelling breath.  I was never a fan of the overly minty or &amp;#34;cleaning product&amp;#34; type smell of other mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> I decided to change my mouthwash from Listerine to TheraBreath because I wanted to avoid alcohol.  During the first week of using this product, I noticed that my mouth felt healthier and my breath fresher.  However, after about one week of using the product, I developed a persistent bitter taste in my mouth.  I used to get a sour taste in my mouth after several hours without brushing, which I haven&#x27;t experienced since using TheraBreath.  But the sour taste has been replaced by a bitter taste that affects how I taste food and drinks.  It seems like this product altered the flora in my mouth.  It may be an improvement for my breath, but I can&#x27;t continue to taste bitter all the time.  At this point, I&#x27;ll probably just eliminate all mouthwash.</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is unlike any other mouthwash I have ever tried. It is not strongly flavored or harsh (the complete opposite of Listerine), yet my mouth feels so CLEAN afterward. I started using this product about 8 years ago and I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> I just finished chemo and never had a mouth sore. I rinsed daily with this mouthwash and I think it made the difference. Hard to know for sure but I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over seven years.  It is effective and does not have ay aftertaste.  I would not use any other product.</li>
    <li> I use this mouthwash in conjunction with the therabreathe toothpaste. This stuff works wonders... I literally do not have to worry about morning breathe or any breathe issues during the day. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Pricey but it works. Gluten free.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute worse mouthwash I have ever used. I read through the reviews before purchasing this about how some had a metallic taste after using this product. I figured since it had such great reviews it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it and find out for myself. HORRIBLE MISTAKE. I used this product once and followed the directions. It says not to eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes after using this product. An hour later I went to drink some water and it tasted like water you&#x27;d get from a fountain filled with pennies. I never used this product again but it still took 3 days for the metallic taste to completely subside. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> We set these up on Subscribe and Save so my husband doesn&#x27;t run out.  His dental/oral health has improved since he started using this product.  You get 2 large bottles at one time.  (His breath is better too, but don&#x27;t tell him I said that...)</li>
    <li> Works great...have fresh breath all the time.  Unlike other mouthwashes, this lasts beyond the first hour.  My mouth feels clean all day.</li>
    <li> I like this, but it seems to get used very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t have that super minty taste that I&#x27;m used to with mouth washes, but the best part is the lack of the alcohol taste that most mouthwashes have. After using TheraBreath for a year, I used a regular mouthwash while on vacation, and I could barely stand it. My mouth felt dry, and I could barely stand the overwhelming taste of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TheraBreath mouthwash works great, and I will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product. I like the product anytime, I recomended this because is really what I was expecting to receive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for a few months and I have noticed that the issue with tonsil stones that I used to have has completely gone away. I&#x27;m so thankful for this product!</li>
    <li> Tried this brand when it was on sale. Glad that is is made of natural ingredients. The flavor is mild so the &amp;#34;minty-ness&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t last too long. Overall it was good, but not sure I would choose it as first option next time I was in need of buying mouth wash.</li>
    <li> Pleased with this mouth wash. Been using it for few months. I would brush my teeth well and use a regular mouthwash, my husband would tell me shortly after I had bad breath. Since using this he never tells me that the whole day long. Works for me!  Does not leave any strange taste.</li>
    <li> Does the trick for my husband. We&#x27;ve ordered several times.</li>
    <li> Mint smell is pure and fresh, not very strong, very comfortable after wash, counterpart of peculiar smell</li>
    <li> Okay, it&#x27;s expensive. So is candy if you look at the effects it has on your teeth when you have to constantly use it to mask bad breath. Feels weird and bubbly like peroxide in your mouth. But hey, it does what it claims to do. It really does get rid of bad breath.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  My wife bought me two bottles for Christmas and they lasted until April.  This stuff has very little taste but it does its job extremely well.  I don&#x27;t always use it twice a day, but it definitely kills bad breath.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this mouthwash. I&#x27;ve been having problem with listerines as their tastes I cannot tolerate. And I&#x27;ve changed other brands which notoriously tainted my teeth and I had to spend time and money in teeth cleaning. This is the only product that&#x27;s soft to the mouth, and it does a very good in preventing bad breath, and most importantly it does not stain my teeth. Highly recommend to others even with the more expensive pricing compared to regulars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I used Crest Pro-Health before and never felt like my mouth was fresh, but this works so much better. I actually feel like my breath and whole mouth are fresh and will keep using this from now on.</li>
    <li> We have included it in our teeth cleaning daily routine instead of any other oral rinse, and we like it. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol was the first thing I liked, it keeps my mouth clean without using invasive ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;One can notice effects on the long run. Only time will show you that it&#x27;s working. It is working for us and we like the taste. It&#x27;s rather expensive, but worth using it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about one year since hearing about it on the radio. I do not have halitosis, but after a long day my breath was pretty disgusting. When you use this as directed it lasts all day, even after eating and drinking coffee!</li>
    <li> Thank you TheraBreath!  I discovered I had tonsil stones which I think were contributing to my bad breath.  After much research, it lead me here to TheraBreath.  The stones fell out after I started using it regularly and my breath has definitely improved.  I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I got a steal. I feel like I paid a lot for a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m plagued with ulcers, and I can say that since I&#x27;ve started using this daily, no more ulcers even when I bite my lip. I love it for that, but again, I think I&#x27;ve paid for it. If it were a bit less, I&#x27;d happily give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I like this product I tried a lot nothing work for me except therabreath  I use it twice a day I follow the instructions and now I more confident than before I&#x27;ll order again thanks</li>
    <li> It works!  Ordered this for my hubby - he is happy, the dentist is happy and I am happy.  So much more effective than anything he&#x27;s used for his gingivitis/periodontal disease.  We now order regularly; it&#x27;s always in supply at our house, and it really works to combat the tell-tale symptoms of his gum issues.  Great product!</li>
    <li> i bought this item with the hope to curb some mild bad breath problems but it works just great. will buy again.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it, and it does it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;I find it expensive, lol, so i use cider vinegar with water, in my opinion much healthier, and way cheaper,</li>
    <li> stuff works. We keep a bottle in our shelves all the time now.</li>
    <li> dont really see a difference so i dont know if it works. but it does leave initial refreshness. . .. .</li>
    <li> Greatest mouthwash to take care of bad breath.</li>
    <li> I use this sometimes and I see results.. I just wouldn&#x27;t say the claim the bottle makes is accurate.. I&#x27;d say it cleans for a few hours.. It&#x27;s hard to tell because there is no clean taste after using this..My breath isn&#x27;t really all that bad but I wanted something to use while at work so if I talked in their faces I was 100% sure they weren&#x27;t annoyed..</li>
    <li> Was hesitant about this but wow am I impressed.  My wife says I no longer have bad breath!  Will be ordering more of this.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to help quite a bit.  Keeps me from getting dry mouth too, which is great.  Besides the antibacterial properties it offers.  Does make some foods and drink taste rather bitter though.</li>
    <li> Lately, I started having a really bad taste in my mouth, which led me to believe I might have tonsil stones. While I hadn&#x27;t seen any recently (after much searching), I&#x27;ve had them a couple times in the past, so I knew it was a possibility. Anyways, after trying numerous mouthwashes (Orajel, Crest Advanced, Listerine, Colgate Peroxyl, etc..), I never could quite get the bad taste out of my mouth (which would come back within minutes after brushing my teeth)... until I tried this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I saw a tonsil stone come out after gargling, and since then, my mouth has never felt fresher. If you have problems with bad breath (thankfully it hadn&#x27;t gotten that far, at least according to my fiance) or a bad taste in your mouth, I would definitely recommend this stuff. The taste isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it leaves a fresh taste in your mouth. I do still feel like I might have something in my nasal passage, so I might try out some of TheraBreath&#x27;s other products, but I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the mouthwash. Once you use it for the first time, you can tell it has something all the other mouthwashes do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I could say is that it seems to make water taste funny for a little while after using it, but that&#x27;s not enough of a problem to keep me from using it. I will continue to use this mouthwash until it stops working or I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Very Very good mouth wash</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how effective this product is. We only have one chance to make the right impression, hence despite the price, this is a keeper in my hygiene tools. Thank you for making an effective product!</li>
    <li> The most amazing mouth wash you will ever need. Leaves your mouth so clean. Use it in combination with a tongue cleaner. Odorless and flavorless.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I used to have a very embarrassing problem with halitosis, despite a tonsillectomy and periodontal surgery. Nothing worked for me before a dentist recommended Therabreath. There are much less expensive mouthwashes out there, but this is the only I&#x27;ve ever tried that absolutely, positively worked. I would definitely be willing to pay even more for this stuff if I had to.</li>
    <li> After nothing else worked, I decided to try this and it worked wonders. I noticed the difference the first day, although it was not until about the third day that I did not have bad breath all day long., but I think that might be because I was not gargling it like the directions suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Taste was rather surprising. It tastes like a stick of wintergreen gum that has been chewed on for an hour. Very mild but not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying again when my bottles run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing, but sometimes I get &amp;#34;tonsil stones&amp;#34; that really make for nasty breath. I&#x27;m impeccable about oral hygiene, so this is really distressing! I don&#x27;t know what it is about this stuff, but it completely kills the odor. Maybe it dislodges the stones? I follow the directions and both swish and gargle. I love that it doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out my mouth. It&#x27;s a very gentle mint flavor and doesn&#x27;t MASK odor...it kills it.</li>
    <li> Tried this to help with tonsil stones . Really a fabulous product. I also use it in my water pick</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  Highly recommended!  The 2 pack actually lasts a pretty long time.  Don&#x27;t hesitate if you are even thinking about it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! When I first tried it I was skeptical since it had pretty much no flavor but right after the first usage I was able to notice the results, it really works! It eliminates bad breath and dramatically reduces &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; as well. I will definitely buy this product again and again and again!</li>
    <li> My favorite mouthwash.  I have tried both flavors (original/ice) and don&#x27;t have a strong preference for either, as this is more of a utilitarian product to me.  It&#x27;s a no frills mouthwash that leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.  No complaints of bad breath, even from a coffee drinker.</li>
    <li> It felt like I was rinsing with water that had all the good benefits to clean and refresh your mouth. It had none of the burning sensation at all.</li>
    <li> I rinsed my mouth with this stuff in the evening, and everything seemed OK. But the next day, I couldn&#x27;t taste anything properly. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why. And I got a little depressed, because my in-laws came to visit and we went out to eat and I couldn&#x27;t appreciate the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing is, I thought this was my new permanent state. It took me a while to realize that this is mouthwash is the crap that did this to me. I threw it out as soon as I found out, including the one unopened bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to keep your taste buds, don&#x27;t use this garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days, and can already notice a difference in the freshness of my breath. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t leaving you with a little bit of a dry mouth feeling, but for me it was nothing a piece of gum or glass of water didn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> Listerine is waaaaay better. This stuff is overpriced and ineffective. My teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean and my gums bled when I flossed. I switched back to Listerine after finishing the first bottle and they stopped. I switched back to the second bottle of TheraBreath and the bleeding started again. Again, switched to Listerine and it stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I, like many others, tried everything to get rid of my bad breath, which my wife (Gini M, whose account I&#x27;m using and who I am convinced is part dog when it comes to smells) has been telling me for years is horrid, to no avail.  I tried this stuff one night and the next morning I woke up and said to her \\&quot;smell my breath.\\&quot;  She cringed but finally agreed, and to my surprise said \\&quot;not bad.  Sorry I cringed but I was expecting the usual.\\&quot;  And that was morning breath, before I had brushed!  I was so amazed, I put myself on the subscription plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I have been experimenting with the dosage.  It says to use 15 mL (up to the line on the cap) and rinse, and then another 15 mL and gargle.  But it seems like too much, especially when I gargle (the bubbles fill my mouth quickly).  I have instead been filling the cap to the first line, which is about 8 mL, and doing each (which still creates a lot of bubbles), with good results.  And that will allow it to last almost a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I found a better way is to fill to the line on the cap (15 mL) and combine rinsing and gargling in one step.  As I said, the gargling fills my mouth with bubbles, so I gargle, then rinse to decrease the bubbles, then gargle, etc.  Works well.  And makes the bottle last a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update update:  I have been now filling it to a line just underneath the suggested line, which is about 8 mL, with good results.  I have also found I don&#x27;t need to do it every day.  So my advice is experiment and you can make this product last awhile and still give great results.</li>
    <li> My wife complained for years about my breath. I could never find anything that worked.  Brushing only seemed to make it worse.  Used in conjunction with a tongue scraper,  I finally feel cured.  This mouthwash is amazing.  And the price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> It really work . I love it no more bad breath</li>
    <li> This works much longer and better than listerine, as long as you gargle for as long as the instructions tell you to.</li>
    <li> So I suffer from ingestion problems, and have been suffering from really bad breath for a long time. It was one of those things where no matter how much I hydrated, brushed, flossed or would mouthwash, nothing worked. I didn&#x27;t even taste it, but others would mention it. It was really hard and embarrassing because I would be afraid to even get close to my boyfriend. So I kept googling and googling, and found this company. I have been using the mouthwash for over a month now, and I also purchased a tongue cleaner and a gel (not this brand though), and I also use a sensitive toothpaste, Sensodyne. These together, seem to work great. I heard that harsh toothpastes can affect breath, so that is why I recommend a sensitive kind, and I think brushing my tongue daily helps too. I love the mouthwash though. It isn&#x27;t harsh at all, and in the morning, you don&#x27;t wake up with a minty mouth, but there is no taste, and definitely no odor! Now, I don&#x27;t actually have bad breath, my boyfriend is even shocked! So maybe my stomach issues cause dry mouth, not really sure, but it worked! Definitely recommend trying. Oh, I also got the Lozenges, really awesome suckers, get those too for during the day!</li>
    <li> Its effect lasts for about 12 hours as advertised, but the effect disappeared when I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is awesome! My wife has a defective salivary gland, and biotene, helps keep her mouth moist but but doesn&#x27;t kill off the infection in the gland, which causes rank breath. This stuff gets rid of the infection and rank breath as long as she uses it a couple of times a week. It&#x27;s AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Works really well, it neutralizes you breath for many hours especially if you have a tonsil stone problem. It does not remove them, but it really helps your breath smell fine. Buy the blue flavored one and it will be even better because it actually has its own smell rather than just neutralizing it alone.</li>
    <li> Very good product and easy to use.  Taste is not strong.  Never want to be without it.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to at least try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves this product.  It freshens your breath, and keeps it fresh longer than other mouthwashes like Listerine.  I was skeptical, but it really works.  The Amazon price (at least for now) is far better than what I can get at Target and Wal-Mart, and with subscribe and save you can save even more money.  Try this product.</li>
    <li> My wife ending up preferring Closys to this option, however I liked the slight mint flavor. To each their own!</li>
    <li> Not sure what it is but made coffee taste horrible for a week after only using it twice.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and even give it to my kids because it has no taste. It&#x27;s almost like water but works amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good.  I only use a small amount and gargle it.  My bad breath emanates form my tonsils.  I would give 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  Try it if you have tonsil stones!  I think it helps treat mine but it isn&#x27;t a permanent cure.  It&#x27;s cheaper on amazon than at the drug store.</li>
    <li> TheraBreath is more effective than Listerine, ACT, Tom&#x27;s, etc. from my experience. It actually leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and oxidized (if that makes sense). It&#x27;s difficult to explain just how effective TheraBreath is at making your mouth feel about 100x cleaner and more hygenic, but it does just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major difference between TheraBreath and Listerine is that TheraBreath is a smooth, non-acidic formula that will not leave you with that &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that Listerine has. A lot of people love that Listerine almost hurts a little bit because they assume that means its killing more bacteria and working hard. While that may be true, and Listerine absolutely does work for a lot of people, TheraBreath is a much gentler ride with a far more effective result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: While TheraBreath is a bit pricey, it&#x27;s worth the cost. In terms of effectively eradicating your stank breath, there is no better product in my book.</li>
    <li> I have bought this many times over and would highly recommend it.  It works well and has absolutely no strong taste like every other mouthwash I have ever tried (including the drugstore ones and natural varieties).</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised.  No other mouthwash or rinse we have tried works except for this one.&lt;br /&gt;Minty flavor.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash! This does wonders for any one suffering from tonsil stones aka cryptic tonsils. I hifhly recommend it if you suffer from them</li>
    <li> Great product! My favorite mouthwash and will continue to buy this product for life!!</li>
    <li> Caring your breath is basic etiquette.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this in the morning, the effect is sustained until the evening</li>
    <li> not open it yet. suppose it is good, so give 5 stars for now.</li>
    <li> This works very well. I don&#x27;t have bad breath often, but I find this very useful as a hydrating mouthwash even on days when bad breath is not an issue. I wish they could just sell this product at a reasonable price all the time instead of making me wait for discounts, sales and coupons, as I suspecte I would use it far more regularly, but I strongly recommend this product regardless.</li>
    <li> had some tonsil stones,  found this in search, have used about 2 bottle worth, the tonsil stone have decreased, but i do not know if because am using the THIS product or because i gaggle... cannot tell yet, will update if this thing becomes a miracle.</li>
    <li> The first breath freshener that I&#x27;ve tried that really does an excellent job. The effect is long lasting and my only complaint is that there is a slight after taste that can sometimes effect the taste of food or drinks later in the day. I find if I only use it once a day - it still gets the job done, and the after taste is barely noticeable. I think next time I&#x27;ll try a different &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product!  Be smart and check around because Walmart is $0.76 cheaper that Subscribe and Save with 15% off.</li>
    <li> no sugar/sweetener, very comfortable. Great product. I can feel the difference between this one and those popular brand products. Leave a clean feel in your mouth the next day.</li>
    <li> it definitely works. I got it primarily to treat dry mouth and morning breath. I only use it at night before bed and I use less than recommended dosage. it will last longer this way. My mouth definitely feels/tastes better in the morning. I dont have good breath, but i dont have bad breath, its almost neutral in the morning which is just fine by me.</li>
    <li> i believe that this mouthwash best first i bought from walmart  then i saw very good and different that all i used so i order more i am very happy with this and give five stars</li>
    <li> my bleeding got stopped after using this oral rinse twice a day.  I got better result after using this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the price!  I will continue to use this product from Dr. Katz. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My family and I enjoy this product a great deal.  It does work to reduce the morning breath and &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; breath.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used and I do not buy anything else anymore. I found it by searching Amazon and the reviews were impressive, but the product speaks for itself. My son is always told by his dentist that he has a &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; tongue and bacteria is easily trapped. I know he is self conscious about his breath so I started having him use TheraBreath after brushing his teeth in the morning and it seems to last most of the day. If you have issues with bad breath, this is the perfect product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed. Use it the night before and wake up with no morning breath. Tastes like diluted peroxide.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this. I have sensitive teeth and it caused them to ache. :-(</li>
    <li> Tonsil stones smell like used cat litter. This mouthwash/gargle eliminates my stank breath. The flavor is subtle, and my mouth feels fresh and clean; not minty and burning. I first saw this in our local drugstore but Amazon has the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife agrees, this mouthwash is the best we&#x27;ve ever used. Thank you TheraBreath!</li>
    <li> I would order all of these products because they really work.</li>
    <li> Perhaps if your breath is so chronically bad, it would be worth the semi-permanent metallic taste that destroys the flavor of food. If you are more like me, whose breath is fine except for \\&quot;morning breath,\\&quot; I cannot imagine why you would want to have this distracting, unpleasant aftertaste that lasts for several hours, and which alters the flavor of everything you ingest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three hours after trying the mouth wash, I had a scotch and I could barely taste it, but I could still taste something bitter in metallic from the mouth wash. I had paella and it tasted like styrofoam, but that bitter metallic taste persisted. My rioja tasted like watered-down Kool-Aid, but of course that metallic bitterness wouldn&#x27;t let go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have no friends because your breath drives everyone away, I guess this would be worth dealing with: I mean, friends or enjoyable food, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are trying to eat less to lose weight, this mouthwash might help, because it destroys all ability to enjoy food and drink.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how the guy who made this stuff figured it out, but this makes my breath so much better. I have lots of post-nasal drip because of allergies and I feel like like...eh...my breath gets a little stanky sometimes. This stuff is amazing and totally does the trick. I recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> Truly a great product.  It tastes great, has good ingredients and does a great job of keeping breath clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used for quite a while now. Does what it advertises.</li>
    <li> I started using TheraBreath toothpaste and mouthwash a week ago, and it really does work!  My breath wasn&#x27;t plant-killing, but I had tonsil stones and moderately bad breath that never quite went away, even right after brushing.  I used this stuff, and bam!  Gone in one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked that both the toothpaste and mouthwash have no medicinal flavor at all.  They&#x27;re not loaded up with artificial sweeteners, either -- just some oil of peppermint, so it really just tastes like slightly minty water.</li>
    <li> Love that this taste isn&#x27;t overly powerful like other mouthwashes! Big fan of this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; this for me one night after I&#x27;d apparently had some garlicky food! He uses it, so I tried it, and it does seem to kill bad breath. I also got the breath mints and really like to have those on hand for emergencies when about to have a face-to-face with a doctor etc. and realize my breath is questionable. It&#x27;s pretty expensive but I think it does work well, so probably worth it if you have a problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for years for a mouthwash that would eliminate bad breath AND THIS ONE WORKS!!  I no longer fear seeing people back away from me and having my grandkids tell me I have &amp;#34;stinky breath.&amp;#34;  Using it after breakfast each morning is sufficient for the whole day in most cases.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 days and it&#x27;s left a horrible metallic taste in my mouth that won&#x27;t go away. It makes food and drinks taste weird and I&#x27;m actually sitting here trying to choke back water! The other day I went to Wendy&#x27;s and got a Coke and I thought something was wrong with it, it tasted very weird, I almost went back to complain about it but then I remembered the mouthwash. I wouldn&#x27;t use this again for a million dollars. I hope my taste returns to normal. It also gives me dry mouth and didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for my tonsil stones.</li>
    <li> This has to be the most powerful bad breath-killer out there. I tried so many others. It&#x27;s the only one to keep bad breath away for an entire day.</li>
    <li> Natural no stimulation, the use of mouth has always had mint flavor, it does not contain alcohol, which I really like, I&#x27;ll stick with, and other products are trying it at home</li>
    <li> Refreshing mouthwash with no burn</li>
    <li> Good product. Mild and tastes good. Recommended by my periodontist. Might want to shop around on price. The local Walmart here sells it for $7.67 for a 16 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> The most effective bad breath stopper. It actually works.</li>
    <li> Horrible and tastes terrible.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash really helps with what it claims to do. I&#x27;ve been buying it right as it begins to run out for a couple of months now. I&#x27;ve only experienced one problem that just occurred. It was packaged in a way that one of the bottles had the cap crack off and break, leaving me with no way to really close it. Not a problem, as I can just use the cap of one of my old bottles. TheraBreath wasn&#x27;t at fault here, blame Amazon packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying TheraBreath for years because it is the best mouthwash we have ever used.  Instead of masking the odor or just halting it for an hour, this works all day.  The price is amazing on Amazon, where you get 2 for the price of one at a local store.  My entire family uses it with great success!!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it is working or not.</li>
    <li> I think it is beginning to help with my dry mouth problem....... rather tasteless so no problem gargling.  Glad I ordered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HLT</li>
    <li> It has a light minty taste, that is not over powering like standard mouthwashes.  It works well and you don&#x27;t smell of mouthwash after you use it.</li>
    <li> Along with the toothpaste, I love this stuff for long days! When you won&#x27;t be able to brush after lunch, this stuff really does live up to its claims! Your breath will be fresher for a longer time!</li>
    <li> My husband said taste good and never feel to hard to hold in mouth</li>
    <li> Extremely effective!  My husband and I have used this product, extensively, for years.  It kills all smells and leaves your breath fresh for hours.  Thanks to Therabreath, romance is well and alive, haha</li>
    <li> Bought for myself and my son. We love it! No more morning breath and eliminated the occasional but awful mothball taste/smell that appeared recently despite daily flossing.</li>
    <li> UNBELIEVABLE!!! Miracle in a bottle is what I call it. For someone who has suffered for years, and done everything I could to correct the problem, it is unbelievable that there is a product that actually works!!!!! I have tried all kinds of mouthwashes, brushing several times a day, trying the advice of the dentist which basically recommended another mouthwash. NOTHING worked. I cried about it often because I have to talk a lot to ppl. I work with children, and if adults lie to you, kids will not. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!!!!!!! Please!! For someone who would be deemed as chronic, I saw instant results. Tried it out this weekend with the kids, and had no issues. No one stepped back or gave me the idea that I had offended them. I got my confidence back!!! I am grateful for this product!</li>
    <li> As a chronic halitosis sufferer, I can truly exclaim my wife says this stuff works great!  We don&#x27;t know why?  But, it just does.  I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I am so tired of this Listerin burning mint flavors - why do we have to put up with it? Please try this soft, mild rinse - that keep you feel clean but you dont have to burn your gums! this is mine forever -</li>
    <li> I have been using a lot of Dr. Katz Thera Breath products for these last few years, and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to keep fresher breath.</li>
    <li> I have being using the oral rinse for about 10 days now ,and the results are amazing&lt;br /&gt;  thank you very much</li>
    <li> I was looking to buy a new mouthwash. These bottles look cool. I expected a &amp;#34;fresh and clean&amp;#34; feeling from the mouthwash. This wash makes me feel like I just gargled with motor oil. It specifically targets bad breath by coating your mouth with some type of oil. Be aware, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make your breath smell good. Its main purpose is to suppress bad breath. I think I&#x27;m going back to the normal mint mouthwash.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is the best. I used to hate using mouthwash because the alcohol burned the crap out of my mouth but not using this mouthwash. It also helps with bad breath. I mean I don&#x27;t typically have bad breath but I do get morning breath which sucks but now with this product it clears it up right after a rinse.</li>
    <li> First time use, enjoyed slight minty taste. But the bitter metalic aftertaste I woke up with is absolutely terrible, it changed the taste of water!!  I&#x27;ll be returning the product.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on here and decided to try it out. I got it in the mail just yesterday and all I have to say is wow!!! You can just taste the neutrality in your mouth. It won&#x27;t make your breath smell like mint like listerine does, but it sure does take away any scent from your mouth and it lasts for hours! I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore about whether or not my breath smells, and I&#x27;ll be sure to recommend this to anyone. This is a must have item in my daily hygienic care!</li>
    <li> Works as describe bit I feel like listerene works better. This just doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the mouth as well just seems to leave I pleasant smell. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Our family has always used the more popular commercial brands of mouth washes. However we chanced upon this product here and saw the rave reviews and decided to try it. The near watery feel of this mouthwash deceived us. In a matter of a week or two our teeth are whiter. Almost no bad breath either. This mouthwash also does not give the stinging feel like some other brands. We are very happy with this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have tried many different other mouth washes and this one by far is the best. We use it primarily in our sonicare flosser and even the little bit we use from it seems to really help keep our breath fresh until morning. There is no burning during or after use which we love! This product may be a little pricey but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Taste is mild and used as described works well.  Is expensive but worth it if nothing else works for you</li>
    <li> I honestly have no idea if this works or not. The taste is barely there, you can just find a hint on mint in there. It&#x27;s almost like gargling with peroxide. I trust it&#x27;s working just based on other reviews, but I really cannot tell. I guess I will keep using it, just in case.</li>
    <li> Tried loads of other products but this one is the best.. Does not burn and leaves a soothing feeling. And in a week you can find the difference.</li>
    <li> Leaves an odd sour taste in my mouth for a solid day after use. I ended up pouring most of it down the sink.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product for Diabetes sufferers! and dry-mouth sufferers out there. It has no alcohol....I buy this religiously from my local Target / Wegmans, and without a doubt, this is the best product out there!. After swishing this in your mouth, you instantly feel hydrated and feel &#x27;neutralized&#x27; from bad breath. The man is a genius that invented this.</li>
    <li> My whole family tried this oral rinse together and we all see the same results - bad breath is gone.  Not masked or temporarily freshened like the store bought stuff, but gone.  Definitely something we&#x27;re going to be ordering regularly.  My mom is Korean and usually brings home this other Dr. formula mouth wash that makes our breath smell like sweet ginseng.  It&#x27;s not bad if you don&#x27;t mind the constant reminder that you just rinsed with root juice.  This Dr. Katz formula has no aftertaste whatesoever.  My mom has been won over and will no longer be buying her ginseng herbal rinse.</li>
    <li> Put me down as a +1 for all the positive comments regarding this product.  It&#x27;s like swishing with slightly foamy water and I barely even taste the mint.  No rough stuff like typical mouthwashes.  For something so mild tasting, the effects are remarkable and long-lasting.  Fresh, inoffensive breath for hours.  This stuff is a real confidence-booster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only revelation I might be able to contribute is that this rinse actually reduces the horror that was morning breath for me.  I do my usual bedtime routine of brushing, flossing and rinsing but my mouth still feels more clean and fresh in the morning than it did  before.  Not wake-up-and-french-kiss-someone fresh but still, a vast improvement wherein I don&#x27;t jump out of bed and feel like taking a fire house to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remarkable product, will never buy anything else again.</li>
    <li> To be more specific, it takes my bad breath away! I am very glad that I tried this product. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a case of halitosis, but I am very self-conscious about having bad breath. So, I wanted something to combat any signs of that. For me, this product did just that. I am really pleased when I wake up in the morning, and there is no or very little presence of morning breath. I would certainly purchase it again, but would purchase it more often if the price were a bit more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and sweet.  I&#x27;m a smoker.  I brush my teeth once a day.  I have immaculate dental health somehow (no cavities, gum disease, or other ailments), but I do wake up with morning breath.  I can not only smell it if blowing into my hand but slightly taste it, too.  I&#x27;ve used other mouthwashes - usually Listerine with no alcohol.  The Listerine impacted my taste buds somehow.  After using it two days in a row, I had a noticeably duller sense of taste.  As a result, I was only using the mouthwash every few days, and then stopped altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the TheraBreath rinse to qualify for a 15% discount on my 6-month Subscribe-and-Save list.  I didn&#x27;t really care about using mouthwash, especially after the bad experience with Listerine, but I wanted that sweet, sweet discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, TheraBreath works.  After using it, the smell and taste of my morning breath are gone.  Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t mess up my taste buds, either.  It supposedly has a &amp;#34;mild mint&amp;#34; flavor, but I can barely taste anything, which I actually prefer.  Now that I&#x27;m using the rinse daily, I&#x27;m going through it quicker than I expected and will have to increase how many I buy or the frequency of delivery next time around.  I&#x27;ve used 75%-85% of one bottle in about 1.5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TheraBreath rinse is pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Works well with other tooth paste but mostly is used for therabreath, The product leaves a taste in the mouth.</li>
    <li> good product. does what its supposed to do. would recommend to others. tastes different then other mouthwashes that ive tried</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the taste and it doesn&#x27;t leave your breath smelling fresh. It&#x27;s supposed to be good for your teeth, which is why I got it and it very well might be. I bought 2 and likely won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
    <li> When I started to kiss my wife goodbye, she crunched her face because of my bad breath. I had just brushed my teeth, and my breath still smelled bad. After one too many mornings of this routine, I decided to get some mouthwash. I looked at all the washes and even tried a more expensive brand. Nothing works like Dr. Katz. From the moment I started using it, my bad breath went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is amazed (and loving it). My sister-in-law and her husband both started using it because I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I take medications that cause bad breath and Dr. Katz has effectively removed that odor as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from bad  breath and dry mouth.</li>
    <li> i like it a lot. though i just try it once. i hope it will work out. if work, i will buy continuesly</li>
    <li> I had the worst breath ever!!  My breath is great but my gums turned red.  I dont know why but it was pretty scary.  They finally went back to pink but while they were red it was scary to look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try it again and hopefully I wont have bad side effects.</li>
    <li> My baby mama has sort of a &amp;#34;sulfur&amp;#34; bad breath sometimes, and this took care of it 100% when regular mouthwash and brushing didn&#x27;t.  It also doesn&#x27;t sting your mouth.  Get the toothpaste with it too!</li>
    <li> Wow, this feels so different! I have only tried listerine and scope and those burn. This doesn&#x27;t burn. It literally taste like water in your mouth but when you spit it out it feels like a toothpaste taste in your mouth and it really does kill bad breath. What an amazing product. Unforunately, I thought it would be bigger, that was the only flaw. But it&#x27;s cause I&#x27;m stingy... and I like a lot for a little, hehe. But this is DEFINITELY worth it. I probably use less of this throughout the day than I would use listerine. So I guess it does last longer. Anyway, this product is amazing! Definitely worth it.. in my personal opinion</li>
    <li> Its pretty good for mouthwash, but over priced.</li>
    <li> I love this mouth wash. I have tonsil stones and after I get them out of my tonsils, I like to gargle and inject this stuff into my tonsils. I also use it every morning after I brush my teeth. It works and my mouth feels refreshed and clean. I like this particular flavor (mint from the green bottle) because it&#x27;s not a burning mint like Listerine. It&#x27;s subtle and refreshing. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and will continue to do so, especially through Amazon where the price is better than Walmart.</li>
    <li> This did a ho-hum job of keeping my mouth from drying out overnight. And although I can&#x27;t vouch for the fresh-breath improvements over something like Biotene mouthwash (which does an outstanding job of keeping the dryness and stink away), I CAN attest to two distinct displeasures from this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The mildly noxious, very NON-minty, chemical-water taste of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;2. The neurochemical reactions it has with my tongue that causes food (and especially water) to taste bad -- metallic and discordant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The labels (and suspiciously enthusiastic reviews here on Amazon) would make you think this stuff is a magic elixir of a moist, minty mouth, but to me it tastes more like something you&#x27;d use to give WALL-E or the Mars rovers a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> As long as you have the patience to gargle and rinse as long as the instructions say (30 seconds gargle, 30 seconds swish), this is a miraculous product. I wake up in the mornings with no morning breath whatsoever! However, even when I don&#x27;t have the time/patience to rinse that long, it is still a pretty good mouthwash. FYI, the flavor in the blue bottle tastes better than the original, and both work great.</li>
    <li> Really helps freshen my mouth so that it&#x27;s kissable for my dear husband ;).</li>
    <li> It is phenomenal! Definitely recommend it...</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Does exactly what they say. No strong stinging taste, just clean breath. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These really do get rid of your bad morning breath.  I do not know how but it really works!!!</li>
    <li> My hubby &amp; I are now long term users of this mouthwash.  It takes a day or two to get used to the natural flavor - but it&#x27;s much less minty and does an excellent job.  My hubby won&#x27;t let me go back to any other mouthwash.  I love it too, try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not sure it is any better than others.  It makes your mouth feel weird.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Not a coverup mint.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes for minty breath, although I found my mouth slightly dry for 1-2 hours after a 1-2 minute rinse.</li>
    <li> I am in the dental field and this is by far the best and healthiest mouth wash.  Most other mouth washes have alcohol in them which gives you that burn in your mouth.  The alcohol can be bad for your gums.  I love Therabreath since it does not have alcohol in it.  Only ingrediants that are beneficial for your mouth!  Also gets rid of nasty gingivitis very quickly.</li>
    <li> very good. it makes my mouth feel really fresh.</li>
    <li> The highly anticipated product.</li>
    <li> Actually noticed a significant improvement in morning breath within a week.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Listerine for decades and wanted to try this product. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but nothing special in our opinion. I didn&#x27;t get that jolt of freshness like I do from using Listerine. It has kind of an odd taste to it as well. A short while after using it, I didn&#x27;t have that fresh breath feeling. This product just wasn&#x27;t a good match for us. I left both bottles on the bathroom counter next to the bottle of Listerine to see if they&#x27;d get used. Truth be told, I&#x27;ve already had to replace the Listerine bottle and these two are still sitting there. We will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I tried so many products but it Works the best!!! You should use it with the Thera breathe tooth paste.</li>
    <li> worked for 15min. at best then it was over.  Will never order again. Price was not bad. But why pay for something that is not working!!</li>
    <li> The wifey hasn&#x27;t noticed any bad breath since I started using it. Except after I eat salsa and garlic... :)  Good product. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> THIS S*** WORKS BOMB. THEY NEED A WHITENING ONE THOUGH.....THINK ABOUT IT. ALL  N ALL ITS A FR SURE 5 OUTTA 5</li>
    <li> It works great as do the mints for &#x27;on the go&#x27; instant protection. Follow directions for best effectiveness and enjoy</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write review but I just HAD TO write how amzing this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always had bad breath as long as I could remember. It was so bad that people either turned their heads or moved away from me when I spoke to them. It was not just embarrassing but actually was damaging my relationships with colleagues and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything. Went to dentist for annual cleaning, removed wisdom teeth (all of them), made sure there was no cavity, flossed and brushed teeth AND used mouthwash 4 times a day, kept a box of mints (tried most of mints available in the market) at work and home, went through one case of tic-tac per day, drank luke-warm water throughout the day to prevent dry mouth. I even got stomach endoscope to see if my stomach was the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came TheraBreath. I did not think it would work just like every mouthwash, toothpaste, and mints I went through.&lt;br /&gt;But hey, it&#x27;s 14 bucks and free shipping - why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out it was THE BEST 14 bucks I&#x27;ve ever ever EVER spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice a day and one week later, I woke up and realized I could not smell my breath. Not only morning breath was gone, clean breath lasted ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works, people. Buy it and be worry-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I also mention TheraBreath does not sting?</li>
    <li> I began using this mouthwash a year ago because it was recommended by Dr. Gregg Frey on www.freysmiles.com. This mouthwash is one of the few that has an alkaline pH. Most mouthwashes (even the alcohol-free ones) have an acidic pH, which can erode tooth enamel over time... Citric acid is an ingredient in most of them.  Also, bad bacteria don&#x27;t grow as well at the alkaline pH.  I love the subtle mint flavor, too.  It doesn&#x27;t have much taste when you begin to gargle, but there&#x27;s a nice minty aftertaste once you spit it out.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used.  It actually works.  The rationale from my understanding, is that the chlorine dioxide binds to sulfur and other compounds that are the cause of bad breath.  This is in comparison to other mouthwashes that \\&quot;cover up\\&quot; bad breath.  Been using this product for a few years now and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company does offer Therabreath gum as well, and it works great, I hope they sell it on Amazon too.</li>
    <li> My husband had bad breath that could not be corrected by going to the dentist and their treatment, so we knew it was not a dental issue, but the bad breath remained until I bought this product.  I should go on auto delivery, because I have been ordering it on a regular basis because it works so well.  So much better sitting in church with him now when he talks to me... and can you imagine what others thought but did not say, when he was near them talking; just saved him some embarrassment, but that is just what wives do... LOL: Just hope he would do the same for me.</li>
    <li> It is the best product so far, you rinse at night and wake up you do not even melt your mouth breath....I truly recommend to any one want to have a good breath ...</li>
    <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t taste or feel like mouthwash, as it lacks that strong taste and perfume, but mouth feels completely fresh when you get up in the morning</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for super minty- this is not your stuff. Its an adjustment to go from something like Listerine to this, but I&#x27;m enjoying the light peppermint oil taste now.</li>
    <li> The rinse is exactly like the one that I wanted , but the only problem is that it felt like it was diluted with water</li>
    <li> This is the only mouthwash we&#x27;ve used for years!  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> i always love to use ...</li>
    <li> Once you stop using this rinse how long before your taste buds go back to normal.  It really messes up with your taste buds especially with water and it doesn&#x27;t do anything to relieve my dry mouth.</li>
    <li> My whole family has been using these for two years now. It helps my boy with canker sore. It keeps the breath fresh for at least 3-4 hours. This costs only about half of one bottle you can buy at local stores.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  This product leaves no nasty after taste like some others I have tried.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically review my purchases.  Okay, I NEVER review my purchases!  That I am here at all should tell you just how amazing this product is.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days, but even after the first use, I could tell a huge difference.  It&#x27;s a weird taste.  Not bad, just so very mild it makes you wonder if it will do anything.  It does.  And it lasts all day at work!  I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this product, and you will be, too, once you try it.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I sometime have tonsil stones and this product does help getting rid of that odor. It does what it  said. It is a bit more expensive than most mouthwash out there but if you use it wisely it will last a long time. I don&#x27;t really need that much at one time and it works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Their priducts contain dangerous chemical preservatives: Sodium Benzoate, and EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;Also, read about the main ingredient, Chlorine Dioxide:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://ask.metafilter.com/148064/Is-Therabreath-Safe</li>
    <li> The product is decent. It is refreshing and I didn&#x27;t have the side effects that others report. I like the fact that you really can&#x27;t taste it. BUT, I did have an issue with customer service that I think you should know about. It was with the TheraBreath Company just to clarify&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve just dealt with their customer service and it was AWFUL! I&#x27;m am always offended when I get bad customer service as that is what I do FOR A LIVING! They falsely advertized something, told me it was a mistake on their end, and refused to honor it. They made excuse after excuse as to why I WAS MISUNDERSTANDING the offer, then they admitted that they had already contacted IT to correct it. It would have cost the NOTHING to provide me, the customer, with the advertised price. My company always says, &amp;#34;An unhappy customer tells everyone&amp;#34;, and that is exactly what I intend on doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that a lot of people would like to defend this product, as would I, but no one wants to be treated poorly, and you should think back to the last time you had terrible customer service. Would you still defend that product or would you put your money where your mouth is. Truth is there are products on the shelf which do the same thing, One major brand comes to mind. Also, generic are made with the EXACT same ingredients and the bottle is almost identical, not to mention cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t support a product which doesn&#x27;t support the people, and as my company says, &amp;#34;remember, the customer make it possible for you receive a paycheck&amp;#34;. In fact, on the bottom of my electronic paycheck it says signed by: you customers!</li>
    <li> Noticed complete resolution of dry mouth and breath issues with first use. Does exactly what it claims</li>
    <li> Cant live without.  My husband uses this and I can tell when he forgets.  This is a must-have subscription for us.</li>
    <li> I like this mouthwash.  It does it&#x27;s job, without burning your mouth - like other brands do.</li>
    <li> I never had bad breathe but a few years ago started having trouble keeping tongue clean and I went to doctor and they&lt;br /&gt;did nothing! I always brushed my teeth and flossed and ate pretty healthy but I have GI trac issues and I did some research&lt;br /&gt;and found the supplements in here are some of the ones recommended to use so instead of spending a fortune and using&lt;br /&gt;the cheap mouthwash that does nothing I bought a bottle for 9 bucks which I thought was high but with the baking soda&lt;br /&gt;and apple cider vinegar I use to gargle with this cleaned my tongue instantly and stopped the inflammation in back of&lt;br /&gt;mouth! I suffered for years and doctors did nothing but cost me money! I hope this continues to work but I&#x27;ve never had&lt;br /&gt;my tongue with clean in years. I don&#x27;t smoke and only occasionally drink a beer and my diet is pretty healthy so I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have those issues. I don&#x27;t find it stops you from tasting in fact I find food actually taste better! I don&#x27;t get the build up in&lt;br /&gt;back of mouth anymore. now this could all be temporary but right now it&#x27;s a miracle. but if you have bad breath I&#x27;m sure&lt;br /&gt;this will work for you and I agree the price is well worth it and I&#x27;m unemployed right now and I still would buy it.</li>
    <li> Want you breath to not stink? Cant get rid of pesky morning breath? Well look no further. I bought this product as the most skeptical person on the planet. I didn&#x27;t look it up online really well but still went ahead and bought it. This product will make your breath smell amazing without the burn. The only thing that will burn is whoevers eyes you are talking to due to the amazing smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the usual brands -- too over-flavored. This is expensive, but the taste doesn&#x27;t hang on in my mouth, and it&#x27;s very good at flushing out bits of food that get stuck between my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 months now and it really works great.I had bad tonsil stones and breath to go along with it that just would not go away, after using this for about 2 weeks once a day with the toothpaste too, it all went away, no stones or bad breath, god sent....Im scared to stop using it for fear of it all coming back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before, and it works really well. I&#x27;m not a mouthwash person, but I like this a lot. My kids use it occasionally. It doesn&#x27;t have scary chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash! This stuff really works. When I use it regularly, I don&#x27;t get that weird grunge on my tongue throughout the day or wake up with it in the morning. I much prefer the Mild Mint over the stronger flavors, which burn a bit because they contain significant amounts of menthol. I also like that the Mild Mint flavor doesn&#x27;t linger, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my tea or whatever else I&#x27;m consuming. I have tonsil stones, and though I gargle with this rinse, it&#x27;s probably not for a long enough time to remove existing stones, as others have said it&#x27;s capable of. However, when I gargle with it regularly, I notice that I get fewer stones, so I&#x27;ll take that. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product that does the job (to the most part). I really like that it has no sweet or strong flavor stuff added to it.</li>
    <li> Been using for years.  Works great.</li>
    <li> It barely worked for me when I followed directions diligently. And I usually do not so it didn&#x27;t really work at all. I swish for 20 seconds or something so it didn&#x27;t work. Not buying again, but if you are up to it, try it out!</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash I have used.</li>
    <li> With this product I have always permanent fresh breath and it&#x27;s not to expensive, I&#x27;m going to start trying Thera Brite Whitening!!!</li>
    <li> This item works and is a great product! Noticed a change right after the first day of using the product. I generally only use it as a rinse after I brush my teeth but it works! No bad breath!!!!</li>
    <li> Since I can&#x27;t smell my own breath, my wife will tell me &amp;#34;Hey, we need to get some more Dr. Katz for you.&amp;#34; This stuff is amazing and after using it for a day or two, my wife notices a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the problem for me is the back of my throat, so I gargle it for 10-15 seconds twice a day. Sometimes after gargling I have a weird taste in my mouth, but I chalk it up to the rinse killing all those silly germs. After using it for several days the weird taste diminishes and it starts to feel like you just left the dentist. This rinse doesn&#x27;t burn and it has a slight minty taste. I&#x27;d use this over Listerine any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to brush your teeth and floss.</li>
    <li> A repeat customer on TheraBreath oral rinse, it works.</li>
    <li> The branding and graphic design of this product is terrible.  I have a nice bathroom that is clean and modern.  Then I have this bottle with egomaniac Harold Katz&#x27;s face and signature on the label and on the bottle cap and some stupid label with coupons folded underneath itself.  Dude, save some money on your packaging and simplify your design so you can reduce your packaging costs and pass on more of your product to the consumer.  You have way way way too much stuff going on.  Too many caps, too much label, coupons, text and copy all over.  It&#x27;s extremely gaudy.  I don&#x27;t care about your life story either.  Do you really have to put on it that its kosher or good for diabetics, like if its not obvious.  Your not swallowing anything!</li>
    <li> I had no idea what tonsil stones were until I ran across the reviews for this mouthwash.  I had been having an issue with feeling like there was something in the back of my throat, so I googled tonsil stones &amp; was horrified at some of the pics.  I took out my purse size flash light &amp; a mirror &amp; sure enough there were 2 little white dots on my tonsil.  They were barely there, but my throat knew they existed.  I ordered this stuff, along with the toothpaste, immediately.  Within a day or so of use, they were gone...like magic!  It was hard to get used to the very subtle taste of this product...most mouthwashes are very strong, but that doesn&#x27;t mean its not working.  It is more expensive than any other brand I have tried before, but well worth it.  My mouth feels great!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for tonsil stones because my research said it was the best. I used it before bed, as directed, I even used a timer, and when I had a glass of water before bed, the water tasted HORRIBLE. It was extremely metallic and bitter. I thought there might be a problem with my Brita, but I tasted the tap water and it was horrible too. I went to bed thinking it would go away in the morning, and I woke up with the awful bitter taste in my mouth. Both my tea and my breakfast tasted bitter, and I haven&#x27;t had more than a sip of water all day because the taste is literally making me sick. I have a sore throat and my tongue is almost numb. To top it all off I noticed a nice new tonsil stone.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this mouthwash. I have chronic bad breath and my remedies are a 15 minute sesame oil pull in the morning and Therabreath at night. I have now cleared my problems. It does leave your lips dry but just use some chapstick. It&#x27;s a tiny price to pay for the confidence of good breath</li>
    <li> Overpriced and not sure its working</li>
    <li> Pleasant taste, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t gum up the tooth brush.  Beside that  my wife says it really works on the bad breath.</li>
    <li> It works and lasts for a good time. Also, using half a cap is enough for me and literally doubles the value of this purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband had chronic bad breath. Truthfully, it was so bad I didn&#x27;t want to kiss him. I read about this online and the reviews were fabulous. I was skeptical that it would work as well as they claimed, but it truly is a miracle.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this stuff at first but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it, I was thrown off by the taste and flavor. It was nothing like what I was used to. I was using Listerine (intensely sweet and minty with killer alcohol burn) and Crest ProHealth (Intensely sweet and minty) which have strong flavors that make your entire mouth taste like mouthwash but they only mask your breath. TheraBreath barely has flavor. It had a hint of hydrogen peroxide flavor with a hint of mint. Mostly tasted like water. And I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work. But I gargled and followed the directions right before bed. And I made my husband try it as well. The next morning we woke up to fresh breath. No morning funk at all. How is that possible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this really works. If it can prevent and eliminate morning breath, it can do anything. Lately, I&#x27;ve been suffering from intermittent dry mouth, and breath funk due to pregnancy and post-partum hormone fluctuations. It was clear that no matter how I brushed and flossed, my breath would still become funky, so it was not a problem with my hygiene. TheraBreath took care of it all (when I remember to use if of course). I highly recommend trying this. If you&#x27;re struggling with your breath, and have tried everything else, you have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn and is highly effective in reducing bad breath!  We won&#x27;t go back to Scope and can&#x27;t wait for our next shipment!</li>
    <li> The best mouth wash, keeps breath fresh.</li>
    <li> I am old, I drink a lot of coffee and, well, I&#x27;m old so I have some stank breath.  I used this once and the change was instant (from the angle of my spouse)!  I now use this TheraBreath twice per day in conjunction with the TheraBreath toothpaste and voila, cured!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  the price for one bottle of this stuff at Walgreens or the local drug store is as much as a two-pack on Amazon, so cost savings is a plus too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for all of my older friends!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for a couple years and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your mouth like Listerine. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> It works. That&#x27;s all you need to know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mouth wash like this before. First of all, the taste... at first I could not figure out what it was, but the closest thing I could think of was raw daikon radish, with a small lingering minty-ness. Not off putting in any way, but it&#x27;s certainly an interesting experience compared to the hoards of green and blue colored &#x27;just shoved a bunch of altoids in your mouth&#x27; tasting liquids you see when you walk by the oral hygiene section. It seriously helps with bad breath and it doesn&#x27;t just mask the smell with a peppermint bomb explosion in your mouth like most mouthwashes seem  to do. As far as something you&#x27;re going to put in your mouth for a minute end up spitting out, this is on the pricier side, which is the only negative thing about it. But I don&#x27;t know if I could justify the cost, so I would probably alternate between this and some Listerine.</li>
    <li> 1st bottle: great, bad breath gone, loved it&lt;br /&gt;2nd breath: had a horrible breakout (blisters+thrush) in mouth lasted WEEKS. I didnt know what it was from, but after months finally narrowed it down to this. Every time I take a break from using it and use it again, it feels like my mouth has blisters all over it. When I stop using it it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alters taste of mouth. I dont know what happened- maybe the 2nd bottle had an imbalancebin the amount of SLS or something. Not sure what to say. I use it periodically like when I sleep without brushing so that the side effects stay to a minimum.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> Pricey compare with the other over the counter mouthwash but worth the money that my family would like to used as well! Oxygenating solution seems to work to prevent dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Really gets rid of bad breath and doesn&#x27;t burn. It taste like plain water and doesn&#x27;t give the minty breath.</li>
    <li> In an effort to try and use more natural products I gave this one a try. First purchasing it locally and then buying it on Amazon. I have to say I really love this product. Its gentle yet effective. Swish this around your mouth and you don&#x27;t taste much of anything but after you rinse then you  taste the subtle mint flavors which is refreshing to say the least. Certainly find this better than some of the big brands that can be overpowering and harsh. This product is certainly neither of those. It is however very effective, use this at night and in the morning your mouth still feels fresher than without using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this one. You will no doubt be skeptical like I was but I&#x27;m sold and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This seems to work well, I had radiation on my throat and this seems to assist in keeping my mouth moist</li>
    <li> Feels like flavored water. Nothing special about it. The main reason I purchased this product, was because other commenters on Amazon stated it may help eliminate tonsil stones. It did no such thing for me. After using this product for a respectable amount of time, I just feel like I was ripped off. The packaging is nice, but like I said, it feels like it&#x27;s mostly H2O with minimal flavoring. SO no, I DON&#x27;T recommend this product. Too high priced as well.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash -&lt;br /&gt;Lasts hours</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that this product would work for me but it does and now I am not worried about speaking to people up close!</li>
    <li> If you have unexplained bad breath... try this!  I don&#x27;t know how it works, it just does.</li>
    <li> Simply excellent and is now my go-to mouthwash. No problems whatsoever. Will be buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> I am a Dental Hygienist and HIGHLY recommend Thera Breath to my patients that suffer with Dry Mouth, Tonsil Stones, chronic bad breath (from lack of flossing and brushing),  ect.&lt;br /&gt; My husband suffers from tonsil stones and this rinse has definitely controlled his breath and the removal of the stones!  The ingredients in Thera Breath works to kill the bacteria produced with your own body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;I have reseached other rinses, such as Closys and Smart Mouth.  This one seems to be more accepting with my patients and easier to use...no mixing involved!!</li>
    <li> This product does not word as well as advertised. After switching to this, I went back to using Listerine because I wasn&#x27;t even getting mild effects for my breath, or at least I didn&#x27;t notice.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have tonsil stones occasionally and even though I brush and floss religiously, I worry about having bad breath. I have to speak to people all day long in my job, often up close.  I don&#x27;t have chronic bad breath, but I know I have had rank breath before and sometimes you can tell when your breath is bad, and other times you can&#x27;t.  This product gives you the complete confidence that your breath is fine, all day.  I don&#x27;t even have morning breath- it&#x27;s so amazing.  And it feels like you are gargling with water it&#x27;s so mild.  If you still have your tonsils, gargling clears out any stones that may be in there within a day or two. It&#x27;s also all natural.  I don&#x27;t get dry mouth from this product, my mouth actually feels more hydrated than usual.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in taste.  I am going to be using this product daily from now on!</li>
    <li> I purchased TheraBreath Oral Rinse at a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;It works!  This is the most effective product I have ever seen to manage bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice a day in the morning and before bed.&lt;br /&gt;By the second application bad breath was gone, and would stay gone all day long!&lt;br /&gt;No other product has been effective for more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Taste (of product) - This is one of the mildest tasting mouth rinses available. For me, most taste either bad or overly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;This was not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Taste Buds - TheraBreath immediately changed the taste in my mouth, water, tea, and most liquids tasted absolutely awful.&lt;br /&gt;In general there was a kind of residual chemical taste throughout the day, very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;The first couple days were the worst, after that it was not as pronounced, but still effected me the full 8 days I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;Liquids were the worst because they were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Most solid food did not taste bad, but had a diminished flavor. Everything was bland or just off a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;This was unacceptable for me.&lt;br /&gt;Dehydration / Dry mouth - No doubt because of the awful taste of liquids my consumption went way down and I found myself getting dehydrated with dry mouth and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the effectiveness of TheraBreath I tried numerous ways to combat the bad taste including gum, mints, hydrating mouth rinse, and other mouth rinses.  I also began using baking soda as recommended for 4 days straight.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste-altering effects of TheraBreath lasted a full two days after I discontinued the product, after which I began to regain my flavor profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TheraBreath altered my taste a negative and lasting way, which is why this product only gets 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately day to day use of this product is not for me. I wish it didn&#x27;t affect my taste because it is unbelievably effective in mitigating bad breath!  I see that Dr. Katz has a NOX lozenge product that is supposed to help with the taste problems, and I may give it a shot in the future.that Dr. Katz has a NOX lozenge product that is supposed to help with the taste problems, and I may give it a shot in the future.</li>
    <li> This was so amazing... wow after eating garlic fries my breath was humming.. but after I gargled with this incredible oral mouth was rinse, I was so confident to talk face to face with in and everybody...  I now keep a small bottle in my purse  for everyday purpose.... must keep it handy, you never know who you may run into!!!!</li>
    <li> Ever heard the saying &#x27;the cure is worse than the disease&#x27;?  I think that&#x27;s very accurate for this oral rinse (if in fact it does actually work, which I can&#x27;t confirm as I stopped using it).  I was very excited about this product after being seduced by the Therabreath website and all the great reviews, but this is an awful product, with awful side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;I occasionally have tonsil stones and bad breath and was hoping this might help reduce both.  However, after following the directions and using this product for only a few days I noticed I always had this AWFUL metallic, chemical-like aftertaste in my mouth and everything I ate or drank tasted bland or strange! The directions say not to eat or drink for 5 mins after using...my ass, try more like 10+ hours!  Even when I use this at night before bed I still notice the lingering affects when I eat breakfast.  And coffee?  Forget about it, horrible flavor even 10-12 hours after using this rinse one time!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I experienced this aftertaste, it was so foreign to me I actually thought I was getting sick or something!  I also noticed my throat and tonsils kind of burned and felt swollen. It wasn&#x27;t until the second time I used it that I realized these side-effects were actually from this oral rinse.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine having such horrible breath that this sort of side-effect is worth it.  Either that or all these people giving 5 stars work for Therbreath OR they never had taste buds to begin with.  As someone who enjoys the small pleasures in life, like tasty food and beverages, I can&#x27;t imagine giving that up, even if I had the most horrible dragon breath in the world and this product was the only thing that worked.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with bad breath and started using the toothpaste and this oral rinse last year. I use the rinse just once a day and my bad breath is gone. I highly recommend these products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 and have been flirting with menopause for years...and a few weeks ago I started getting full-court-press menopausal symptoms...all at once.  Hot flashes, night sweats and drumroll...menopausal dry mouth.  I felt like I was sucking on a metal bumper all day.  Worst taste in my mouth.  Ruined the taste of food and liquids for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Biotene mouthwash and it said on the label it was safe to use up to 5-times a a day.  But I got no long term relief....and the mouthwash really left a bad after-taste in my mouth.  Blah!!  I felt the Biotene gum worked better...but the gum loses its taste pretty fast.  I also kept biting the inside of my cheek...since I&#x27;m not a big gum chewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I saw Dr. Katz&#x27;s Thera Breath Mouthwash on line. I highly recommend this product.  It is awesome. It gave me back my normal sense of taste...instead of the taste of metal intermixed with my food and liquids.  I love this product. And it&#x27;s a 2-times a day mouthwash vs the 5-times a day with Biotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also...I highly recommend the citrus lozenges for between meals.</li>
    <li> Excellent for fresh breath.  I use the mouth wash along with Therabreath toothpaste.  I like all of Therabreath products.  I used to have tonsil stones  After using Therabreath products made for tonsil stone removal, they went away!  Now, I just use the oral rinse before probiotic gum and my breath is fresh.  It is cumulative.  I like the new Therabreath blue bottle minty fresh flavor mouth wash as well.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if any rinse works since it is difficult to smell your own breath but surprisingly, given the very mild taste of this rinse, I find it very refreshing. Simply put, it gives my mouth a very clean, neutral feeling.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out for a couple weeks.  It seemed fine, my breath didn&#x27;t seem bad, and the rinse left my mouth feeling fresh.  Then out of the blue, I use it at night, and wake up with the most terrible taste in my mouth.  I thought something was wrong with my morning coffee the flavor was so off.  After I ate, I noticed my mouth still tasted like some off shoot of this rinse.  It lasted about a day before it subsided.  It was certainly the rinse that caused the issue, but I have no idea why it happened randomly a number of uses.  I just can&#x27;t risk having that happen again, so I&#x27;m done with this rinse.  Sounds like it works for at least some people, could be body chemistry.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t believed until you tried as indicated...</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, as I occasionally suffer from tonsil stones.  I used it three times before I realized it had ruined my taste buds.  Everything tastes terrible now.  I can only hope that this is temporary, but the mouthwash is going back.</li>
    <li> If you have bad morning breath like I do, just freakin use this. Morning meetings at work, morning classes in school, morning sexy time with your significant other. You don&#x27;t have to worry about those anymore. This mouthwash isn&#x27;t stingy and minty like the others are. Very smooth. Lasts about 4-5 hours. Also a great price too. At other retail stores like CVS, one bottle of this thing costs almost 20 dollars. Please people. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> Ehhh.  Have been using for the past 6 months.  I feel as if the alcohol based Listerine works better.  Probably not as good for me.  But prefer it better.  Probably would not buy this again.  However, will continue to use until it is all gone.</li>
    <li> Really helps keep my my stinky breath away. Only mouth wash that&#x27;s worked for me. I wish it was a teeth cleaner too :P</li>
    <li> My son loves it because it doesn&#x27;t burn, but really makes your whole mouth feel so clean all day. We keep buying this brand over and over</li>
    <li> I love this TheraBreath. I am taking several medications and having dry mouth. I have ask my doctor  he said drink more water.. not working. I was done some research and found this . I am so glad I did. Used this twice today and have NOT had dry mouth since. This is just what I needed.  I have tried so many others that did not work. Glad I have this now.</li>
    <li> Best mouth watch product for bad breath.</li>
    <li> Weak tasting and not super effective, I was looking for a Biotene replacement and this is not it.  I gave the second bottle away.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for years. Very high in CVS, so it&#x27;s best to buy it here. Kills bad breath in just one to two use. I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best oral rinse I have ever tried. Nothing else does not even come close to controlling bad breath. It leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed. I love it so much that I put it on auto ship.</li>
    <li> WOW!!! WORKS FOR US! IMPRESSED! Really like this stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought the TheraBreath Oral Rinse to take care of Tonsil Stones and i&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks now. I can tell there&#x27;s a difference and plan on continuing to use it. It has been the only thing that&#x27;s worked for annoying tonsil stones that can&#x27;t be physically removed. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS! It says all natural but at the top of the ingredients list is tetrasodium EDTA. The taste is bad. Would not recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> No effect whatsoever, might as well rinse with water.  Will go back to Smart Mouth I guess. Which I really don&#x27;t like the after effects of but it does work.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash really works. I have been using it for 3 days now and my mouth couldn&#x27;t feel any fresher. You will get your taste buds back. The flavor is good too it&#x27;s a soft minty taste. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely baffled at the glowing reviews for this stuff. What floors me even more is that some of them even go so far as to claim that there are no side effects. Really guys? No side effects? I&#x27;m with the guy who rated this one star. I was feeling slightly more generous since it \\&quot;works\\&quot; so I bumped it up a star. Sure, it eliminates bad breath but so does any other zinc based mouth rinses out there. The problem is that for some reason, few people ever mentions the fact that zinc based mouth rinses also eliminates your ability to taste. How is that not a side effect people!? That&#x27;s a pretty major side effect. If my food starts tasting more bland than baby food, i&#x27;d list that as a side effect and this little side effect lasts the entire day with just one use. The bottle actually says to use it 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three times! Are you kidding me, dudes? How about I just chop off my tongue? That could probably eliminate bad breath too and apparently, for some people, that wouldn&#x27;t make the list of side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if your breath could be classified as a biological weapon, you can make the sacrifice to never taste food ever again. But for everyone else, find something else.</li>
    <li> The product claims to work for like 12 hours...I would  say, in my experience, that amount of time is no where near accurate (perhaps a half an hour).  I went back to my regular whitening mouthwash.  Lasts longer and has a great, refreshing taste.  I see a dentist on an extremely regular basis and it is not my teeth causing any problem.  In addition, I brush 2-3 times daily and always clean the tongue and roof of my mouth.  Drinking coffee is my problem.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product works and the effects on my taste buds are not an issue for me. I get very chapped lips when I use it which can lead to a cold sore for me though. I also experience a sore throat. I am surprised no one else has mentioned this side effect though that is probably why the probiotics become necessary -  to equalize the bacterial ecology in the mouth? It is however a solution (no pun intended lol) to the confidence destroying effects of chronic bad breath.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is great! I have been using this product for almost a week now.I dont have morning breath in the morning which is great. The only thing I dont like is that it doesnt have a minty taste. I guess the inventor of this mouth wash couldnt add peppermint extract or something. I used to buy Total Care Listerine mouth wash, but I wont be doing that anymore. I do use Colgate toothpaste still though because I just hated the taste of the Therabreath toothpaste. I would recommend this product even if it does cost about $9, its still worth it though!</li>
    <li> Good product. Will recommend. The bottle loses its potency within a month of being open but until then works very well.</li>
    <li> Has an unpleasant aftertaste.  Does work.  After a few uses moth becomes very dry.  Better off using Breathrx. Won&#x27;t buy product again.</li>
    <li> This is a breath rinse not your Mommas mouthwash!!!  It is so mild tasting and it WORKS!!  I am plagued with breath from hell and after only 3 days of use, it&#x27;s fine now. I don&#x27;t shy away from talking to people and I even wake up with better breath even.  Highly recommend getting yourself this oral rinse by Dr Katz.  I am going to try the toothpaste now.</li>
    <li> On the downside, it does leave an odd aftertaste that literally lasts for half a day.  But on the upside, it really works: I gargled and rinsed with this last night, and when I woke up this morning I asked my wife to gauge my breath before I brushed.  Her comment: \\&quot;I don&#x27;t smell anything at all; your breath is totally neutral.\\&quot;  Wow.  If my morning breath doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, I&#x27;ll live with the aftertaste!</li>
    <li> I used to use Biotene to alleviate dry mouth at night. I had an old bottle of Therabreath laying around, so I tried it when I ran out of Biotene, and discovered that it works just as well if not better. The taste is also more pleasant.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful when I first tried this product, since I believed there is no real cure to bad breath except following a very strict regime. I was extremely (and pleasantly) amazed to be proved wrong. I haven&#x27;t tried it for morning breath, but my day-long bad breath has disappeared. I use slightly less than 10ml , but must rinse for 1 whole minute, and gargle for all of 30seconds for it to work. I read negative reviews about its metallic taste, but thankfully, did not have the same experience. Definitely a miracle product for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and another product called Smart Mouth.  This product is good and is great for my kids (9 and 7) because the taste is pleasant and it keeps their breath fresh.  For me however Smart Mouth works better.  It works for the advertised 12 hours while this product only works for an hour or two.  I do keep a bottle in my car however because it is so much easier to transport than Smart Mouth since it comes in two bottles.  This might work great for some people but not so much for me.</li>
    <li> I like this mouthwash - not too strong tasting.  Very refreshing</li>
    <li> This mouthwash really does provide long lasting relief from bad breath PROVIDED other appropriate oral hygeine practices are followed (e.g. Flossing and adequate brushing).  So it is effective.  It is NOT a vacation from a regular regimen of oral care.</li>
    <li> TheraBreath gets your breath up to par without the burning or chemical crap as other mouth washes.  I have bought several of these over the years.  I am always face to face with clients so I make sure my breath isn&#x27;t offensive.  Nothing drives me crazier than someone with funky breath.  This may sound crazy but put it in the fridge.  It adds to the refresh feeling of rinsing.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does!</li>
    <li> Nothing short of miraculous!! If you have a post nasal drip problem, and never know when you will have a breath problem, this is your miracle sent from God--through Dr. Katz, of course!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I have a bottle at home and work and use it daily.  Use subscribe and save to get it cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like it. Taste great. It does what&#x27;s needed not leaving those yucky minty taste like those major brands. I would definitely recommend this to my patients for halitosis.</li>
    <li> For 2 days after a I try this mouthwash I couldn&#x27;t taste the food, I had a horrible bitter taste in my mouth. I&#x27;m so upset because I spend 43$ for nothing, the nasal drops are the same.Maybe works for people with serious bad breath and other problems.</li>
    <li> Works very well. No sting or strong taste. I use as prescribed but find that the amount (full cap) is way too much liquid for me to hold in my mouth...especially too much to gargle. I would be like a fountain spilling over to gargle a whole cap, so I use 1/2 cap to slosh and 1/2 cap to gargle. Product is really very good at clearing out and controlling the bacteria that causes odors and problems.</li>
    <li> Works for me! No more dry mouth bad breath. Problem solved. And no burning from Listerine either. My brother even commented that I was doing something different.</li>
    <li> Quality is very good, also buy this next time.</li>
    <li> I just try it,  and Wooow! it really works:), the best on the Market, do not look for more, buy it!</li>
    <li> After using 3 bottles, I found this product to be ineffective after 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Works as stated. No more gum chewing</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first and always used Listerine then I used it for the first time..and was pleasantly surprised. I can wake up and not brush my teeth and use this and people don&#x27;t notice at all.......</li>
    <li> I guess it works.  use it before bedtime.  if you use it during the time you&#x27;re up, it makes things taste weird. even water taste weird.</li>
    <li> Use with now foods oralbiotic blis k12.  My son did  this mouth wash morning and night and then 10 min after took an oralbiotic that is specifically designed for mouth flora and his horrible breath vanished.  Highly  recommended both.  Oral biotic is cheap!</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I have personally ever used</li>
    <li> This is the only product that helps my wife with the symptoms associated with Sjogren&#x27;s.  The mouth wash and toothpaste is the only thing that she could use with a recent bout of Burning Mouth Syndrome. It is also super helpful to use the mouth wash at night before bed. I would highly recommend this product if you suffer from dry mouth problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years, ever since my periodontist suggested he&#x27;d like to cut my gums off so help my deep pockets around my teeth.  He had no other options to offer, so I did a little on line research and discovered Dr Katz products.  My pockets are now within normal ranges and the periodontist was surprised, but didn&#x27;t really want to know how I was able to accomplish these results.  I&#x27;ll keep using this and he can keep being ignorant and we are both happy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very few products that seem to work as advertised. I wish it was a little cheaper, would have given it five stars</li>
    <li> This gets rid of bad breath but unfortunately it killed my sense of taste had to stop using it.  It may work ok on others though.</li>
    <li> Awful taste and didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.  I threw both bottles away.</li>
    <li> Long lasting but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some other mouth washes, this doesn&#x27;t burn like cheap whiskey when you swish it around.</li>
    <li> The best, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> The Therabreath line of products have done wonders for my breath and my confidence. I recommend it to anyone constantly worried whether their breath is really fresh.</li>
    <li> I started buying this mouthwash after I found I really liked the toothpaste. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s necessary to use both to have better breath but I like that this rinse is alcohol and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate free. I have also grown to trust the brand and would recommend any of their products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this problem because I was having a lot of trouble with tonsil stones.  I bought this product based on other people&#x27;s reviews.  I have to say.  It doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  When I first started using it, tonsil stones were coming out like crazy, which is kind of gross when you think about it.  However, it seemed to me that this product released the stones and the stink, creating happier tonsils.  My breath was fresher for much longer, and the recurrence of tonsil stones was lessened.  Definitely give it a try if you have similar issues.</li>
    <li> It really works. My husband brushes only in the morning, and flosses maybe once a week. Yuck. But since he started using TheraBreath, I can stand to kiss him again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year... It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found. I used to use standard mouth wash but found that it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. After reading many reviews, I decided to try it out. The flavor is a mild mint - not overpowering. I&#x27;ll admit the sensation when I first used it was a little strange. But it left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh, and I feel like I don&#x27;t need to worry about bad breath - something I ALWAYS worry about. I will forever use this product. well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have had the worst breath for about two years. No matter how often I brushed flossed ri sed the terrible sell always came back. This fixed the problem!</li>
    <li> The stuff really does remove bad breath all day long.  It does leave a slightly metallic taste in your mouth.</li>
    <li> The taste of this is fine. It works fine. Unfortunately it makes everything taste horribly bitter - even if I only use it at night and not in the morning. Seriously, I hope I am ever able to taste anything normally again. It is awful. Water even tastes bitter!</li>
    <li> This Mild Mint is great - no strong, burning effect at all. I can swish it for a full minute &amp; it really helps with bad breath. It has ingredients that will help if you continue to use it. Everybody is different &amp; it may irritate some people or cause weird aftertaste. If it doesn&#x27;t, use it - you may like the effects, like no bad breath! And I have serious bad breath because of some medication I take (antihistamines for allergies). Try a smaller bottle from a store first to see if it suits you.</li>
    <li> Starting using this with the tooth paste and it had no effect. The tooth paste is almost the consistency of water and left my mouth feel less than clean. If used by direction, a bottle will last you about 15 days.</li>
    <li> favorite new mouth wash</li>
    <li> This oral rinse works better for us than the alcohol based products because it does not dry out the mouth as much.  The mild mint leaves the mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> i got this for my two daughters because they wanted it to help with bad breath and also due to the lack of chemical products. they absolutely love it and even i am starting to use it now. we all love it because it leaves your mouth tasting like nothing with a very mild mint flavor. so your breath doesn&#x27;t smell like old minty crest toothpaste, or the food that you just ate. we have the toothpaste, the mouthwash, the throat spray, and the lounges. they all work very very well and the mouthwash keeps your breath feeling and smelling fresh for over 4 hours! i definitely recommend this product and we will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Fresh breath guaranteed</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for tonsil stone help on this stuff, i bought a bottle today at a safeway--1 bottle for $10.99 so amazon has a much better deal but I didn&#x27;t want to wait on shipping to &#x27;cure&#x27; my stones and bad breath.  Over the last few months I&#x27;ve developed tonsil stones (I think it&#x27;s a vitamin I&#x27;m taking) and they&#x27;ve been driving me nuts and making me super self concious about my unfresh breath.  I&#x27;ve been trying to get that lump in the throat feeling out and hacking and brushing and gargling and gagging with no success I tried this stuff, like I said, today and I followed the directions to a T this morning and still had a lump in my throat...but tonight I gargled again and OMG! I opened my mouth and actually was able to finally see that gross white lump in my throat and pushed it with a qtip and I spit it out! So whether it was a coincidence or this stuff really works I intend to continue using it as long as I have bad breath or stones.</li>
    <li> I have tried both the mild mint and icy mint. The mild mint gets 5 stars while the icy mint gets 1 star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild Mint - So mild it&#x27;s almost like rinsing with water and yet your breath will be fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Icy Mint - Felt like it was on a mission to destroy my taste buds and anything living in my mouth! It was way too strong and definitely altered the taste of foods afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had started with the icy mint, I would have thrown the bottles away and written a one star review. If you are having trouble deciding which to purchase, start with the mild mint.</li>
    <li> My husband says it&#x27;s the only mouthwash that works on my bad breath...better than lysterine!!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed by TheraBreath!  I&#x27;ve tried other mouth wash brands and while I can feel some freshness with said brands, it doesn&#x27;t ever seem to last.  TheraBreath works an incredibly long time and I can feel my breath still being fresh hours after use.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that burning feeling while rinsing my mouth out, though I know some may like that burning sensation. As a person with dragon&#x27;s breath, I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good rinse or problems with bad breath.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST stuff. It does not have a harsh and burning nature like most mouthwashes. If you use it with the toothpaste it really keeps your breath fresh WITHOUT just &#x27;covering&#x27; the odor. I have used it for 8 years and since, have not had an issue with bad breath since. I believe it&#x27;s had an impact on positive dental checkups as well!</li>
    <li> I just tried this mouthwash. Seems it clears the bad breath from throat!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;I planed to do tonsil surgury but now I will wait more....</li>
    <li> Do exactly what it says on the bottle! Your mouth will feel sooooo clean afterwards!  My daughter told me I had bad breath and I started using this and she told me she can say it doesn&#x27;t smell anymore. ..I&#x27;m so conscious about my breath...now I feel more confident in kissing my fiancee!  I will use this product forever!  Buy this if you&#x27;re looking for better breath and an all together clean feeling mouth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for a week now, and I can already feel the difference. Also, it does not leave an aftertaste, which makes it good to use in the morning.</li>
    <li> You will experience a mild aftertaste for the first couple of days but it will fade with time- once you adjust to it.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other mouth washes it does not make you feel like your mouth is burning..Give yourself plenty of time before your first or next delivery as Amazon will take an extremely long time to ship your package. Five days later and it still hasn&#x27;t shipped.</li>
    <li> It works. Plain and simple.  Dr. Katz has done his research and create a product that has made a huge difference in people who has suffered lifelong hilatotis.  He has done where no big companies such as Colgate, Crest or Sensodyn could.  It&#x27;s shameful that with their vast amounts of research and development, they couldn&#x27;t come up with an effective toothpaste or mouth rinse to combat bad breathe.  The TheraBreath Oral Rinse really works after 1st rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that TheraBreath products can be found in various local retailers, I do hope the prices of various TheraBreath products will decrease and be more competitive as well as affordable so more people can use them.  Here&#x27;s hoping to find 4oz TheraBreath toothpaste and 16oz TheraBreath Oral Rinse for about $4 each by 2015!</li>
    <li> This is not hyperbole, this mouthwash really changed my life.  Despite a meticulous oral hygiene routine, I used to have some awful breath.  It was so bad that I was self conscious about it and would keep a distance from people during conversations.  After trying numerous products with little to no success, I came across this and quickly saw improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is decent enough and it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like Listerine.  The instructions advise swishing with a cap full for a couple minutes, spitting, and then gargling with another cap full for a couple more minutes.  I found that this was probably necessary at first to get rid of any tonsil stones but I&#x27;ve found that one cap full is enough (at least for me) to maintain clean breath once the stones are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found this stuff.  It&#x27;s one of the few products that I just can&#x27;t do without.</li>
    <li> Product came very fast, I like it, it&#x27;s dosen&#x27;t have that strong burning that a lot of mouth rinses have, it is lightly peppermint flavored, mouth feels clean after.  I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple weeks, but I like it, I&#x27;d buy and use this product again and again.</li>
    <li> This is a very good mouthwash.  It leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh for hours.  I recommend this brand.  The price is also pretty good.</li>
    <li> Like with the Therabreath Toothpase, this had a very mild minty taste.  I was able to gargle and rinse my mouth out longer with this rinse then my usual brands.  Since I could keep it in longer, I felt I was doing a more thorough job of cleaning my mouth.</li>
    <li> Really works! No more morning breath</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what some of these people are talking about; this stuff is very mild tasting and I can certainly still taste everything that I eat/drink. No metallic taste from the rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Freshens your breath&lt;br /&gt;Tastes pretty good&lt;br /&gt;No burning sensation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Is pretty expensive&lt;br /&gt;Directions try to trick you into using too much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you followed the instructions on use, you would go through a bottle a week. They are something close to this: Use morning, evening, and every other time you can. First use one capfull to swish in the mouth. Then use ANOTHER capfull strictly to gargle in the throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use much smaller amounts than it calls for and it works just as well; I can&#x27;t speak for people with extreme cases of halitosis though.</li>
    <li> Great Investment! Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I get small white things on my tonsils. The official name for them is \\&quot;Tonsilloliths.\\&quot; I&#x27;m not sure why I get them, but they have a terrible odor. Without going into much graphic detail, these white chunks cause some serious bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing my teeth 20 times per day would not make a difference. Listerine, Scope, etc--nothing helps. Until now. Therabreath is the first product I have found that actually gets rid of the awful odor. What a wonderful discovery. I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about my breath for many years. Finally, I can feel certain that my breath is not offensive. That peace of mind is worth every penny spent on bottles of Therabreath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never by any other brand of mouthwash again. My loved-ones are also grateful that I found this, especially my girlfriend. Goodbye morning breath.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash definitely does what it says it will. Hands down the only thing that has helped my family.</li>
    <li> I wanted  a more natural mouthwash than Listerine or others, so I decided to go with this. I notice a considerable difference when I use it daily. I definitely notice a difference after I&#x27;ve eaten something harsh, like onions or garlic. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t burn!</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing. I never really had a problem with bad breath until about a year ago. My case wasn&#x27;t bad at all, I just had to consistently chew gum or I&#x27;d end up with a bad situation. After about 8 months of chewing gum almost every hour of the day (very frustrating) I decided to look for help beyond gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: This product also helps with Morning breath!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The only rinse works for my husband&#x27;s bad breath.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This really does leave the mouth feeling very clean and yet not minty. Noticed morning breath hasn&#x27;t been an issue and have already purchased more from TheraBreath.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s very effective at fighting bad breath.  A couple of years ago, I discovered that Amazon sells it at a much lower price than my local Rite-Aid, especially when I use the Subscribe-and-Save option. Its oxygenating action leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn and works great!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. It doesn&#x27;t feel or taste like it&#x27;s doing anything but it makes a huge difference. We can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.  Great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say, after using two bottles of TheraBreath the oral rinse was NOT helpful.  Did NOT live up to its promises.  Will NOT purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product works great. It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like regular mouthwash, it doesn&#x27;t change the taste of things. It has a very lite mint taste, it doesn&#x27;t dry your mouth out. I just finished my 2nd bottle and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is the best because I have used every mouthwash in the world and this one really does the job.  It&#x27;s not minty or harsh on your mouth and it keeps your breath smelling clean and fresh.  I would recommand this line of products to my friends and family members if they are have bath breath problems.</li>
    <li> For the treatment of oral problems is great</li>
    <li> It works like it says! Just use as directed-- swish it in your mouth for a minute and gargle for thirty seconds-- and no more bad breath! The directions say to use every 8-12 hours, and I find that as long as I&#x27;m not eating anything crazy and making sure I don&#x27;t leave food stuffs in my mouth for a long time, it does last for about 12 hours. Otherwise, 8 hours. Which is a pretty dang good amount of time!  Good!</li>
    <li> The Best Mouthwash Money Can Buy</li>
    <li> Although tonsil stones don&#x27;t simply fall out as some reviewers claim for me, it definitely seems to loosen them, making it easier for me to get it out with the tip of a toothpick (only recommended for people with steady hands). They seem to form less frequently as well, although I still regularly get them every few weeks. Make sure you follow the instruction because I found that it doesn&#x27;t really work as well if you do a quick job. I wish it was a bit cheaper as well. It&#x27;s a little pricey for what it is.</li>
    <li> Side effect, severe soar throat, had to go to my doctor to have it checked out. I only used it for 2 days had to stop, in process of trying to return it. Would be great if they could cover my Dr. Visit.</li>
    <li> Very mild mint, hardly noticeable. Much less refreshing than commercial rinses, Hope it is healthier to use</li>
    <li> My ENT recommended this product as an alternative to getting my tonsils removed due to do constant tonsil stones.  However, I waited two years before I tried it, and that was only after I read all of the reviews.  I wish I had tried this two years ago!  This mouthwash has significantly reduced my tonsil stones!  I rinse (mostly gargling) for 1-2 min. morning and night, but use nowhere near the amount suggested - I use maybe a third of the amount and it is plenty.  I notice that when I start to slack on my regimen, I get a tonsil stone, so this really tells me that it&#x27;s working.  And the fresh breath is just a great bonus; I no longer worry about the stones causing foul odors.  I just have a nice, clean taste in my mouth, pretty much all day.  Not really minty, just clean.  I&#x27;ve gotten my husband to use it too, and his coffee breath goes away after he uses it.  I also feel that price here is a good one; I saw this mouthwash at a major drugstore for a lot more money.  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The best mouth wash I&#x27;ve tried so far. I use this per the instructions and it really does work. Gargling with the mouth wash really helps too. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> it is a good product after using it it helped my bad breath and i dont suffer anymore from it but water and  food has some strange taste after using this product. anyway ordered 4 more bottles for me because it is a cool product therefore i ordered therabreath toothpaste too. i am going to use this product  as it really do stops bad breath from your mouth</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;m impressed. When I first swished this stuff in my mouth I was very surprised&lt;br /&gt;at the basically \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; taste.  I&#x27;m used to strong tastes, burning tongue, etc., the things that are  supposed to indicate that the product is working.  I used the TheraBreath toothpaste and the rinse before bedtime last night and was shocked at the reduction in my horrible morning breath. I again used both the toothpaste and the rinse before I left for work this morning and it lasted ALL DAY. The awful taste and odor from my chronic postnasal drip was not there.  I even had onions for lunch and didn&#x27;t taste them for the remainder of the day like I normally would.  I have to say, for me anyway, this stuff WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be excessively long, simply cut to the chase. I&#x27;ve used TheraBreath products for almost four years running. Effective, real remedy for \\&quot;bad breath\\&quot; and dry mouth related issues. Skip all the side fluff, all you require is the ThereBreath toothpaste and the Oral Rinse (reviewed here). These, combined with thorough flossing, will eliminate bad breath......caveat, unless there exists a condition (gum disease, periodontitis, decay in teeth, etc).&lt;br /&gt;Lacking that, a consistent regimen of these two products is miraculous. Cannot recommend higher....</li>
    <li> Basically just water with a tiny hint of peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no difference between this and just swishing around some water</li>
    <li> I noticed I had a breath problem but was not sure of how to deal with it. Initially I would chew gum, eat mints, etc. Until I realized that it just came right back. So I started researching and it came to Therabreath and Smartmouth. I ultimately decided to try Therabreath since it is all natural and cheaper. I honestly didn&#x27;t believe it would do anything significant. But man does it work. My boyfriend of 6 years noticed a difference and he is very pleased... As am I. I like that it does not have a harsh taste or burning sensation. I brush and use it in the morning and at night. Now my breath isn&#x27;t minty fresh all day ling, but it never smells bad to where I feel like I need gum, even after eating. Try this product. I&#x27;m sticking with it!</li>
    <li> The worst oral rinse that I&#x27;ve ever tried. Please note that you won&#x27;t be able to taste food at all if you use TheraBreath.</li>
    <li> I tried this mouthwash and really liked it, although I definitely can&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating because it doesn&#x27;t prevent morning breath like it says it will on the bottle. At least not for me anyways (I have halitosis). I used it at night and had exactly the same bad morning breath as always. BUT on a positive note I do feel that it did something extra for me that other mouthwashes didn&#x27;t do, which is neutralize the bad breath instead of just masking it. Ohh and btw, it will get rid of garlic breath instantly! I use it twice a day and then at night I usually just use regular listerine mouth wash because it&#x27;s cheaper. I can&#x27;t say that the effect of Therabreath lasts all day because if you eat something you may still feel the need to pop a mint/gum etc. Unless your eating something really bland. Over all tho this is an amazing product. It will keep your breath wayyyy fresher than any other mouthwash out there. My breath stays fresh for hours! I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other prodcuts like breathrx or anything like that. I have been wanting to try them all out for the heck of it. Ohh and btw I tried the Therabreath toothpaste and hated it. Tastes horrible (like the gel on crest whitening strips! weird!) and made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
    <li> great mouthwash . doesnt seem like mouthwash but does the job. leaves you minty fresh and better price on here than buying at local super market</li>
    <li> my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean when I used this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it kills any germs, but it does cover up any kind of taste in your mouth for a bit I guess. wont buy again.</li>
    <li> really good oral rinse.</li>
    <li> This product made everything, especially water and tea taste horrible.  I used it once and now more than 12 hours later I can&#x27;t eat or drink anything without grimacing.  Even my saliva tastes like cleaning solution.  I wish I would have read more reviews before purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This worked well but it made my next two meals taste like they were prepared with saltwater. I drank some water--saltwater again. Ate some ice cream, more saltwater taste. Hey, this might help me lose some weight! No thanks, saltwater ice cream. Anyway, now I only use it for special occasions when I MUST HAVE excellent breath. Or lightly-salted, otherwise-inoffensive breath.</li>
    <li> My husband has this hereditary bad breath thing going that is not from bad teeth or tongue. It just runs in the family. Maybe coming from his stomach. Anyway, the normal mouthwashes stopped working but this stuff works great. Absolutely no bad breath if he uses it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Tastes pretty dang nasty</li>
    <li> This does absolutely nothing, it appears to be plain old water with a hint of hydrogen peroxide.  Breath appeal works so much better, but it tastes like wet blanket.</li>
    <li> Even after flossing, brushing, tongue scraping, and rinsing with generic mouthwash, my breath can still have a hint of foulness to it. It&#x27;s depressing. I gave this a try after seeing all the positive reviews, and can say that it really works. One half-capful of this stuff, and my breath is completely fresh for the bedroom.</li>
    <li> Just to be clear, I did not meet the criteria for this product as far as suffering from dry mouth and bad breathe. Having a pretty normal mouth with no issues, I purchased this mouthwash as a curiosity. The first and only time using this which was around mid-day left a negative impression on me. After I had gotten done rinsing there was a brief moment of freshness but soon faded leaving only an aftertaste of castor oil. I had gone about my business and almost immediately found my self almost drooling as this seemed to have a enhanced effect making my mouth too wet from an abundance of saliva working overtime. On top of this there was an issue with food/beverages as others have stated somewhat altering my taste buds. As a last thing I would like to point out this product left me with a sore throat and wouldn&#x27;t you believe what this product claims to prevent, it ended up giving me dry mouth later at night (reverse effect). The only thing I could take away from this would be if you have mouth issues or not do not purchase this good if you&#x27;re planning on changing things up in your mouth wash game.</li>
    <li> Wish They Have Bigger Sizes And Lower Prices!</li>
    <li> My breath was so bad that people would move away from me when I spoke, which made me never want to speak to people or to feel obviously awkward when I did. I tried the rinse and toothpaste and I NEVER have that problem anymore. I am not shy about speaking anymore and I feel SO much more confident in general. This is a real dream come true for me. Abolutely give it a try if you are suffering from bad breath whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Therabreath gives me, by far, my favorite tasting and feeling breath I&#x27;ve ever had. I can only describe the smell as an untouched, unaffected rare natural plant. It just tastes so natural and earthy. A fresh, right after a rainstorm earth. It&#x27;s how it tastes and it&#x27;s how my breath feels too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there is zero burn. It feels like water in your mouth. Of course, it bubbles a LOT when you begin to gargle. I sometimes have a hard time keeping the \\&quot;foam\\&quot; from overflowing out of my mouth. To avoid this, I&#x27;ll try to use a tad less than recommended (you pour into the cap which has a marker of where to pour up to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle recommends you do two passes - gargling and swishing around, both for 30 seconds. It&#x27;s a minute of freshness I rarely get to feel, I love doing it. Yeah, it means I go through the bottle faster than I ever did with Listerine, and I&#x27;m paying more per bottle. Yes, I&#x27;d love to see the price come down some. But it&#x27;s not completely killing my wallet, and the experience I get from it makes it well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep buying the stuff. I&#x27;ve never been attached to a single brand of mouthwash before. I only used to know Listerine and I&#x27;d get whichever was on sale or sparked my interest (do I get \\&quot;Total Care\\&quot; or the all-white super whitening bottle?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing this product is NOT is antibacterial. There seem to be two schools of thought here: One says antibacterial is bad; in mouthwash or even household surface cleaners because the germs that survive the pass are the strongest and they are left to multiply so your problem gets even worse. The other school of thought says this is not the case. Personally, I like to go on the attack. So I&#x27;m all for antibacterial stuff. I just use twice the amount or use it for twice as long. If Listerine or BreathRx says to swish for 30 seconds, I&#x27;m doing is for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Therabreath doesn&#x27;t have anti-bacterial ingredients - I will still use something like BreathRx Antibacterial before bed to kill germs. I don&#x27;t care for the super-powerful \\&quot;Clean Mint\\&quot; flavor, but I figure it gets the job done, and it gets great reviews on Amazon. In the morning before going out, I&#x27;ll use Therabreath. And then I can really get my mouth feeling and tasting the way I want it to, the way I love it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahhh, I just want to rinse with it again right now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - Best tasting/feeling breath ever, a tad pricey but well worth the investment. Not antibacterial, but I&#x27;ll use antibacterial at night and use Therabreath in the morning before going out to get my breath the way I LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Not sure why you&#x27;d buy the 2-pack on here which totals $28.94 before taxes when you can get two individual boxes from Pharmapacks (here: http://www.amazon.com/TheraBreath-Rinse-Fresh-Breath-Flavor/dp/B001IFTCZ0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_12?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1347553351&amp;sr&#x3D;8-12) which total $26.16 that&#x27;s a total of $2.78 in savings!

    <li> Family member had constant bad breath... Brushing, etc didn&#x27;t work.  They now use this a few times a week and no bad breath!</li>
    <li> Not sure HOW? it eliminates bad breath....when each morning my breath is just the same.</li>
    <li> Not what they advertise it to really be.  Other than it is suppose to be better than your average mouth wash. I did not feel it created &amp;#34;Fresh Breath&amp;#34; as they say it would</li>
    <li> Not bad but seems not work for the dry mouth problem.</li>
    <li> Just received the package yesterday and gave it a try this AM.  This mouthwash really leaves your moth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a life saver.</li>
    <li> Presently works really well</li>
    <li> My husband has had a horrible problem with bad breath for years.  Since using this product, he has not had one day of bad breath!  Wish we had found this product years ago!!!</li>
    <li> I have the Mild Mint. Ever since I&#x27;ve tried this mouthwash, I haven&#x27;t used anything else. Although I&#x27;m not picky, it works well and doesn&#x27;t burn like Listerine does. Some people may not prefer this as they like that intense tingling sensation to feel like their mouth is clean.. but this mouthwash leaves a nice minty fresh feeling. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Effective for bad breath but leaves a strange taste that even 6 hours later makes food unpleasant to eat . Made my dry mouth worse even though it&#x27;s supposed to relieve dry mouth</li>
    <li> If your husband is a cigar smoker, get this product! If mine uses their toothpaste and then this mouthwash, I can&#x27;t tell he was smoking! I love Therabreath products. Try the breath lozenges as well.</li>
    <li> I get wicked dry mouth from my CPAP so I gargle and rinse with TheraBreath every morning.  Takes that cat crapped in my mouth feeling away instantly and I&#x27;m ready to face the world!</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash.  It does not burn or sting and your breath feels fresh.</li>
    <li> this worked ok, as i mentioned in the toothpaste review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to bring this into my dentist. After reading all the glowing reviews perhaps my expectations weren&#x27;t reasonable. From a taste and mouth fresheners perspective I much prefer the Listerine product at Costco prices as opposed to this I think over hyped mouthwash that leaves no fresh breath tingle iron feeling in my mouth whatsoever,p. After reading the ingredients I was enliven less impressed. However, when my six month dental appointment happens, I&#x27;ll bring this in with me and ask for my dentist&#x27;s honest opinion. If he recommends it as this company suggests dentists do, and if he tells me why, from a hygiene standpoint thus is a superior product I&#x27;ll come back and revise this review. In the interim, I&#x27;m shelving thus and returning tonal is terrine</li>
    <li> I have chronic bad breath. It&#x27;s due to the food I eat, I know. I could brush my teeth and literally 5 minutes later it smells like a &amp;#34;used condom&amp;#34; according to my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always seen this on Amazon as the highest rated mouthwash and oral care. I just never thought about spending so much money for toothpaste and mouth rinse. But I caved and spent money on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought was OMG This taste disgusting. I, like most, am used to a more minty.artificial clean taste. This says &amp;#34;Mild Mint&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s almost not even there, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing. It&#x27;s a very natural taste, no artificial flavor or smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a week, and constantly do the hand lick smell test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in the morning before work yesterday. Through my 10 hour work day I had apples, yogurt, salami, cheese, mayo, bread, fruit snacks. doritos, cheetos, juice, soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home at 7 at night my wife was amazed my breath smelled like I just brushed. This instantly eliminated any odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++++....will def buy again</li>
    <li> This really helped with my throat issues, I would recommend it, no more annoying tonsil stones! And long lasting fresh breath, and its safe!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this mouthwash is the taste or lack thereof.  I don&#x27;t like the stinging of Listerine.  It seems to dry my mouth.  I brush my teeth before showering then rinse with this in the shower.  This is mild and it really seems to work when you swish at night, it carries you til morning.  I use a mouth guard at night but feel my mouth is fresher in the morning after using this product.  I have it on auto delivery.  It costs more but I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Neutralizes breath more than masks it with minty strong sweet smells. Has a light minty non-sting flavor that is perfect. I think what amazed me the most was its ability to eliminate ANY smell/taste of garlic within one gargle. Don&#x27;t be lazy though, you have to follow the directions (1 minute mouth, 30 seconds throat)! I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my friends and family. I don&#x27;t hype up many things, but this is honestly the best mouthwash in terms of eliminating odor on the market. It&#x27;s magical and I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> So, a product that actually does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. I was a bit skeptical at first but changed my mind after just one use. Something I&#x27;ll be using for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the only mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used that really lasts.  I Definitely recommend it and Amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I needed a new mouthwash, was in the mood to try something besides the usual Crest, Listerine, etc., and because this product was #1 in its category and received amazing reviews and testimonials.  I don&#x27;t have issues with bad breath per se, but like anyone, I don&#x27;t exactly wake up in the morning with minty clean breath, so I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try the product.  About 10 days later, I quit it, and was honestly just as excited to stop using TheraBreath as I was excited when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, at least, I did notice an improvement in how my breath smelled.  But, I also experienced side effects that overwhelmed the benefits.  First of all, as others have noted, this product changed how food and drink tasted.  I noticed this especially with coffee and tea--at first I thought there was something wrong with the water filter I was using, as these drinks were suddenly tasting somewhat minerally and just ... off.  Then I noticed the issue in general with not only drinks but food.  Everything tasted muted, and mildly unpleasant.  The bottle warns you not to eat or drink for 5 minutes after using the product, but I experienced these side effects throughout the day.  Moreover, my mouth was constantly dry and my tongue felt a bit \\&quot;hairy\\&quot;.  I developed a sore throat and cough that took weeks to get over ... the latter issue might not have been related to the product, but in reading some other reviews I&#x27;m not so sure ... I got better shortly after quitting the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TheraBreath gets many great reviews, so I have to believe it works for some people.  If my breath was so bad that it was a major social or professional concern, perhaps I would&#x27;ve put up with the side effects or hoped that they&#x27;d go away with time.  But, as someone just looking for a mouthwash that would keep their breath relatively fresh, the side effects simply were not worth it.  I have to think that for most people, a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; mouthwash will do just fine ... I was happy to go back to Crest after using this product for a little bit, and am happy to enjoy the taste of food and drink again.  So again, this product appears to work for many people ... but I&#x27;d advise a little bit of caution based on my own experience at least.t fine ...

    <li> After a horrible experience with some Crest Pro Mouthwash, I decided to find something that is one of the best on the market. I&#x27;m not convinced that this is it. Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling that you are any cleaner after having used it. A very subtle mouthwash...but pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with Dr. Katz toothpaste and a tongue scraper and I have received very positive feedback. If you&#x27;re thinking your breath stinks it probably does and this product can help. Don&#x27;t forget a tongue scraper though, I think that&#x27;s most important.</li>
    <li> Has made such a difference in the quality of my breath and my mouth feels so clean when I use it!</li>
    <li> I have had terrible breath since for about 13 years. My self esteem has been very low as a result and I always shy away from talking to people.  I have spent a fortune on different breath mints and gums to no avail.  I have never invested in anything much more than mints and gums.  But I became so desperate because I realised how my breath was affecting my life.  I have been using the toothpaste and oral rinse for 3 days and it is AMAZING... I keeping licking the back of my hand, trying to smell my breath and nothing! its almost too good to be true.  I also use the orabrush I found on amazon.  I brush with the therabreath toothpaste, rinse with oral rinse, scrape my tongue with my orabrush and rinse again.  I am soooooo much more confident.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  The money is I small price I pay, if the price was 50 tomorrow, I would still buy it!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mouth wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I have tried all the non-alchoholic products as well as traditional scope and listerine. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> I had been suffering long time by bad breath. I tried several different products but non worked well. Now with this my wife is so happy for significant change.</li>
    <li> This product helps  alleviate bad breath within 30 mins. Any other foods that I would eat without using this toothpaste/mouthwash would cause chaos in my life. Thank you Dr. Katz and the person who sold this product to me.</li>
    <li> I never was a huge believer in oral products that claimed to be the end all be all to fresh breath, and I surely wasn&#x27;t willing to spend $6+ on something to simply spit out. I had a couple extra dollars so I purchased a 16 oz bottle at Target one day, and I can honestly say this stuff works and truely is worth the extra money. If you brush your teeth with a quality toothpaste and drink plenty of water throughout the day, you&#x27;ll see a difference in your breath for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that eat foods with a large amount garlic and/or onions, this product will help...but not cure all your woes. This product is best used when you first wake up and before you head to bed. A rinse after lunch will be helpful, but is most impactful after brushing teeth.</li>
    <li> Nice product without the miney overwhelming mouthwash smell.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review as someone who gets tonsil stones, tonsiloths, if you get them you know what I am talking about. This and the whole line of therabreath did not help prevent my tonsil stones. I used the oral rinse, the toothpaste, and the throat spray. If you suffer from this read on because I will tell you what did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the above being said, this did work for general bad breathe. The gross white film on my tongue disappeared, and I dipped my floss into this before flossing to get rid of the smell between my teeth. I could tell there was a smell there because when I flossed I could smell it.&lt;br /&gt;The method I used was&lt;br /&gt;1. prerinse&lt;br /&gt;2. floss&lt;br /&gt;3.tongue scrape&lt;br /&gt;4. brush teeth&lt;br /&gt;5.post rinse&lt;br /&gt;6. throat spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you suffering from tonsil stones I am going to provide you to my reviews of two products that did work to significantly reduce the amount of tonsil stones I get. Please read my reviews as I discuss how I use them. I do not know why this helped to prevent my tonsil stones but I do know that I went from getting them several times a week to a few times a year. I don&#x27;t discuss my tonsil problems in my review of the ear oil but I do believe that the ear oil and peroxide in the ears provided a huge impact on my tonsil health. (I started thinking there was a relation because when I would clean my ears with a wet q tip and smell it, it had a similar smell to tonsil stones, not nearly as bad, but something similar to it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R26OSUEX71PB1X/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0001TNCK0&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HAYQERRJ10XQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001E11CPQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a tonsil stone sufferer and this helped you please vote it up so I can help others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment if you have any questions at all, I would be happy to respond and answer any questions you have.</li>
    <li> I use TheraBreath religiously and although it isn&#x27;t real minty or an obvious fresh breath product, I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like when I use it, my breath is fresher and clean.</li>
    <li> Great but your wine will taste different.</li>
    <li> After going through 1+ bottles, I can say that this works better than other regular mouthwashes I&#x27;ve used in the past. It has a light and clean feeling/taste to it, does not burn, and helps a lot with my tonsils/tonsil stones. I actually haven&#x27;t had any since I started using this product, and I only use it once every other day. It is pricey, but a good complement to other cheaper mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> This is the first mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried that actually works. I&#x27;ve used it at night before without brushing my teeth (I know) and to my surprise my breath the next morning was not bad.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS BELIEVE IT NOT</li>
    <li> Miracle product. Works better than scope or listerine. Being alcohol free it does not dry out my mouth.</li>
    <li> ╔ ■ Price Point: 2.5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ■ Quality/Durability: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ■ Need: 4/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ■ Recommendation/Giftable Factor: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ☼ Overall: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;╠ ►Who needs this:  Everyone&lt;br /&gt;╚ ►The bottom line:  I love this stuff. The packaging can be off putting since it looks like medicine and not what you are used to. But once you try it, you fall in love with it. It doesn’t burn and it lasts. The green bottle tastes much better than blue to me. You go out forgetting to brush when you use this. It does hold up to the 12 hour claim. It can be more expensive than other brands, but also works better. Stock up when these go on sale!</li>
    <li> This product work first use...I can&#x27;t explain the magnitude of my satisfaction. For the last 2 years I started having bad breath to the point my wife complained just about everyday...I would brush an it really didn&#x27;t help...it&#x27;s embarrassing to have this problem...I went to class one night and a girl next to me must have smelled a whiff an whispered to the girl next to her an she was laughing...I couldn&#x27;t talk to ppl too close...I felt so bad an my confidence was gone...I&#x27;m a handsome man, but with this problem it doesn&#x27;t matter...I was skeptical in buying this product but finally I did after reading the great review...an the first use my mouth felt a freshness I didn&#x27;t think was possible...If any person has a breath issue I am being very honest in saying you need to get this product ASAP...it&#x27;s also sold in Walgreens, CVS, Taret, Rite Aid...This Therabreath thing works...for any review less than 5 stars clearly these ppl must have issues that can&#x27;t be fix...no disrespect guy.</li>
    <li> Amazing product that works instantly and last for a very long time. Will buy again. I just wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Ever since trying this I&#x27;ll never use another kind. The flavor is so soft it won&#x27;t overwhelm you and it doesn&#x27;t burn at all. Short of blowing on someone and asking their opinion I can&#x27;t tell you if it is actually effective, but it provides peace of mind.</li>
    <li> Very good mouthwash. Works as described. Worth trying.</li>
    <li> This is fresh breath insurance</li>
    <li> I did not feel any difference before and after using it.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this product. My partner has been complaining for a while about my bad breath. I found myself chewing gum more and more as I started to get paranoid about my breath. I happen to be at Target the other day and saw this product there. Thought I would give it a try. What an amazing difference! I use it morning and night with none of the metallic taste others complain about. Have used it for a week now and no bad breath complaints. I&#x27;m starting to feel confident again and owe it all to this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results of this product, in addition you lose taste sense. This horrible product and waste of your money.</li>
    <li> I buy this monthly now, because it&#x27;s seriously the best mouthwash. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I just gargled mint juice, it makes my mouth clean and fresh enough to kiss my girlfriend after waking up with morning breath. It does a good job of eliminating the smells from a flavorful meal too. Simply put, they should call this stuff the breath neutralizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: you need less than half a cap full to do the job or else you&#x27;ll have too much in your mouth and don&#x27;t be surprised the first time when it tastes like nothing, but then makes water taste sweet.</li>
    <li> The least offensive, best mouthwash I have ever found. This version has no burning sensation after use. TheraBreath are now offering a different version that contains menthol for those who mistakenly confuse the sensation of coolness or burning with greater effectiveness. The effect is chemical, not topical, and this version does an excellent job so long as you gargle for at least 30 seconds to give it time to work.</li>
    <li> Leaves a terrible taste in your mouth and changes the taste of everything you eat the rest of the day</li>
    <li> Very effective in eliminating bad breath!!!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash works really well. I feel like I had bad breath and would move away from people when talking. It has increased my confidence by using. Glad I purchased the 2 pack.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this and the toothpaste combined and it has vanquished my unholy morning breath. :) I will definitely be buying more TheraBreath products in the future.</li>
    <li> this is great. doesnt burn and freshens breath. do NOT get the other blue flavor as that one burns and doesnt taste good. this original one is great though</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand, or how I ever survived without it now that I have. It works like some sort of Juggalo miracle. There&#x27;s almost no taste whatsoever. There&#x27;s no overpowering mint or flavoring or alcohol. It&#x27;s like water, with one drop of peppermint essence. Zero aftertaste. My mouth feels amazing. I&#x27;ve read in other reviews that it&#x27;s very helpful with tonsiliths, so I&#x27;m looking forward to that too. This is definitely staying on my subscribe &amp; save list.</li>
    <li> This along with the toothpaste is guaranteed to keep your breath fresh the entire day. If you struggle with bath breath, this is the answer.</li>
    <li> My wife told me that my breath was getting a little ripe by the end of the day, and that really upset me. I hate talking to people with bad breath and I really didn&#x27;t want to be one! This stuff seems to work great! Taste was a little strange at first, but I got used to it (just not sweet or minty like most mouth washes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have been using this for almost exactly a year (it is much cheaper to buy on Amazon), and I have had no complaints from my wife about my breath. I rinse with is in the morning and night (in combination with brushing teeth, flossing, and better tongue brushing). Every now and then, I&#x27;ll use my wife&#x27;s normal mouth wash, just so I attach the bacteria from a couple angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best indication that it is working is that I now notice my wife&#x27;s bad breath. I&#x27;ve tried to hint that she should try it, but haven&#x27;t made any traction yet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this stuff, and I am usually really skeptical about &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> I love it!! It surely does what its made for. Thera breath products keep their promise. They have the best oral products I have ever used!! Buy it!!</li>
    <li> The problem is, I have Lupus and my mouth is sensitive. There are only three toothpastes I can use that don&#x27;t cause sores in my mouth, and it&#x27;s not just SLS or numbing agents I have to avoid. After 2 uses of Dr. Katz TheraBreath Oral Rinse mouthwash I had terrible, large canker sores on my tongue, the roof of my mouth and in my throat. I bought this based on the claim it helps canker sores (does not cause them) and breaks up tosilliths, which I get. Well, that is simply untrue and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to find out about tonsil stones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product sounded benign, but it is not for everyone. Using it is tastes and feels like rinsing with diluted hydrogen peroxide and baking soda- like Oxyclean for your mouth. They tell you to use a whole cap full to rinse, but I can&#x27;t fit a fraction of that in my mouth without swallowing. It also has no cavity fighting agents like xylitol or fluoride. I won&#x27;t be using it again, but I should have known better. If this helps you in any way please vote yes below to make the review more visible.</li>
    <li> This was a life changing product. Had heard all the hype and was very skeptical, but I am a believer. I tell everyone about this product now.</li>
    <li> I have been plagued with bad breath all my life.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried more products than I can count, without any results.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use I notice a complete difference.  No more bad breath.  I find I only need to swish once a day and that is in the morning.  My breath is always fresh and it takes me less than a minute to do it.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to constantly chew gum when in contact with co-workers.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t it great when there is a product that seems too good to be true that isn&#x27;t? That&#x27;s Therabreath. It does exactly what it says it will. It freshens your breath and leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. And it lasts--maybe not for 24 hours, but it lasts a long time. It can take down onions, garlic, hangover breath--no problem. Really great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the TheraBreath Fresh Breath Toothpaste, and it has gotten rid of my halitosis for the most part. I am no longer asked by my significant other &amp;#34;Have you brushed your teeth today?&amp;#34;, so that&#x27;s probably a good sign. Overall it works!</li>
    <li> Both me and my wife loved this product during the first day we tried it. It definitely works in removing any traces of bad breath, but we started to notice side effects from it immediately after the second use (at night). These side effects are much worse for me than for her however and they include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sore throat! This is terrible for me. Sometimes its hard to swallow it feels that sore. This lasts a few days too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Dry mouth. The product states that it helps with dry mouth, but we both feel like it actually makes it worse. I had to do some new hire training at work and that included some lecturing, and I felt like my mouth was drying up and my throat ached for water. This has never happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Changes the taste of food. For me, sweet foods became bitter and more salty, and \\&quot;off\\&quot;. Even filtered water tasted very strange... like I was drinking city water right from the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This product does not cause congestion, but when we (me and my spouse) blow our noses, we see several spots of blood that is definitely not normal. My wife even said she got a nose bleed this morning. She doesn&#x27;t suffer as bad as I do, and says she will continue using it. I am DONE using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that neither of us tasted anything \\&quot;metallic\\&quot; like several reviewers have noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I believe that the suggested dose (fill to the line) is too much and me and my wife have always used less than the directions state. I also stopped using it and waited for the side effects to go away before trying it again so I could be sure my side effects were from this mouthwash. The effects came back as soon as I started using this again.&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE.</li>
    <li> It tastes good when rinsing but afterwards I have a horrible aftertaste in my mouth for the next day.  Beverages taste especially terrible, even water!  It lingers for at least 8 hours, sometimes even over 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Helps with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> NEVER order it with Dr. Tung&#x27;s Products: Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner, they just make you pay $22.89 and for only the 2 bottles and never give you the tongue cleaner! RIP OFF</li>
    <li> My husband uses this &amp; it seems to work very well for him.  We both like it :).  Subscribe &amp; save works out pretty well too as we&#x27;re Prime members.</li>
    <li> first time using this product, it really does solve the dry mouth and i feel my breath is not bad or good but neutral, i am very curious to see the long-term effects. will update you after 30 days.</li>
    <li> I like this mouth wash alot.  It is gentle, refreshing and really does cut morning breath.  Unfortunately it does not get rid of tonsil stones but it does seem to reduce the rate at which they form.  A very good product.  If you like super minty mouth wash this isnt for you.  It is a very mild mint taste but I love it now and I feel more confident that my breath is better</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product ever. Gets rid of the bad breath permanently.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this mouth wash would work since I have chronic tonsil stones that never went away. Also, I occasionally had a strange bad taste in the back of my throat. It didn&#x27;t matter what mouth wash I used, these symptoms never went away. The first time I used this products all of my symptoms stopped. Seriously. Stopped. Bad taste...gone.....tonsil stones....only the occasional small one compared to the huge ones I used to get. In addition, my mouth feels rrally moist. I never thought I had a dry mouth, but compared to what it felt like before I&#x27;m in heaven. This product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Tastes gross and burns my skin for days if I get it anywhere around my mouth or chin.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with all the things I  Bought so far from amazon. Really good quality always on time. They have the best price compare to all the big expensive stores out there.</li>
    <li> We always keep this in the house. All other the therabreath products are wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong harsh flavor like many mouth washes. Is very effective for giving you fresh breath that last a long time.</li>
    <li> A bit salty, but not bad</li>
    <li> Used this product two times the first day that I had it. When I woke up the second day everything that I drank or ate had a terrible after taste like I was drinking metal. It has been 15 hours since I last used it and the aftertaste is less but still there. Unfortunately I bought 2 bottles which are now useless to me. Will be looking for a new mouthwash. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It works. Before using this I would notice a slight coating on the back of my tongue that would never go away permanently no matter how much I brushed. After using this it felt completely clean. What I learned is that I would only need half a cap full every 2-3 days.  Its effects would last until about the 3rd day. The negative for me is that it does leave a metallic or bitter taste in your mouth. So, water and other drinks taste slightly bitter. The tradeoff is worth it for me. Now, when is the price going to come down?</li>
    <li> It works!  Worth the money, haven&#x27;t found another brand as helpful for bad breath.</li>
    <li> It does what it is made for..  Bad breath is gone with theabreath..I do recommend it for everybodywho is concerned about his breath.</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash for my grandson</li>
    <li> Wonderful, as always :)</li>
    <li> I began using this mouth wash because I was having trouble with tonsil stones.  I have definitely noticed that my breath is fresher and the number of stones I experience has been greatly reduced.  In fact, unless I am having trouble with allergies or I have a cold (two things that for some reason always seem to cause stones to occur) I am never bothered with tonsil stones since beginning the product.  It also makes my mouth feel more clean and fresh than regular mouthwash does, and that&#x27;s without the burn of alcohol.  The flavor is mild and pleasant.  If you are considering it, I would recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash out there, simple ingredients, good ph level, I tested as around 9.7, and cleans my mouth good!!</li>
    <li> This is a good mouthwash.  No burning.  No crazy strong aftertaste to where everyone can tell you just used mouthwash.  That being said, by the other reviews, I thought this mouthwash was going to be magical.  It is not.  Not sure it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Actually works!!!! Fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, does the trick, but too expensive.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! If you use it properly, your bad breath will disappear. You can even use it for your pets.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this oral rinse and does exactly what it promises. It&#x27;s not harsh like the other mouth washes and is smooth</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;ve already left a review about 6 months ago but proably didn&#x27;t go thought since this window poped.  Well I had a bad breath, and I didn&#x27;t know until my wife told me so.  Since then I was very timid and shy and I had to stay away from people when I was speaking in front of them.  I didn&#x27;t wanted to get too close.  It was mentally very depressing.  After using this product, it miraclly disminished about 80%.  It &#x27;s very easy to use, just have to rinse with it.  Not like other rinse it doesn&#x27;t sting your tongue or has strong mint flavor.  This was was like rinsing with regular pure water.  I hope this helps and It&#x27;s worth to try it out if you have problem with bad breath.  Of course checking and going to dentist for cavity is first!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, this stuff really works. I was skeptical, but Therabreath is so much better than sickening sweet, alcohol minty mouthwash. My mouth feels clean, instead of like the germs were just covered up. I am ordering an extra bottle to keep in my desk at work. This stuff is expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my breath.  The only complaint I have is the price.  It lasts about 2 weeks per bottle per person.</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash I have used, and I can&#x27;t be without it.  The taste is not overpowering, and it doesn&#x27;t leave an aftertaste.  It may be a little pricey, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  I always regret it if I skip a day.</li>
    <li> Like the mild mint flavor.  Price is pretty high, doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything other than be good for breath.  I think smart mouth does a better job of controlling morning breath.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried so far, much better results than listerine or crest</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple of weeks hoping to get rid of my halitosis and it does help, but I have not noticed any significant increase in the amount of time that it keeps my breath fresh compared to other mouthwashes. Regardless, it left a very bad aftertaste (bitter and metallic in quality) that frequently did not go away until the next time I brushed my teeth. Initially, I thought it would go away after I got used to it, but it got worse over time (lasted longer and became more bitter). The recommendation on the packaging is to use it twice for 30 seconds each time you use it, but after awhile I decided to just use it once each time to see if this would decrease the aftertaste, but it did not help. Due to the aftertaste, I will not use this product again nor would I recommend it to someone (unless that someone doesn&#x27;t have taste buds anymore).</li>
    <li> this is our go-to breath freshener for daily use and especially after eating garlic-covered croutons!</li>
    <li> Good for fresh breath.</li>
    <li> Keeps my mouth fresh for hours and hours. It doesn&#x27;t dry my throat too.</li>
    <li> Still have gorilla breathe but it feels good.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the mint flavor after taste and reminds me of hydrogen peroxide rinse.  Still good but I think it needs a stronger mint flavor.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this product saved my life and I&#x27;m not exaggerating either! I&#x27;ve been a lifetime bad breath sufferer and have tried EVERYTHING! I thought it was a lost cause. I actually thought the bad breath was coming from my digestive system. I&#x27;m still in disbelief this product have worked and worked 100% for me! I use this together with TheraBreath toothpaste and after the very first use, NO MORE BAD BREATH!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it and still surprised!&lt;br /&gt;I also started taking Now Foods Oralbiotic Blis K12 when I started the Therebreath toothpaste and rinse but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the Therabreath products that did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you have suffered from bad breath and nothing have ever worked, trust me, if it worked for me, it will work for you!! I can&#x27;t describe how much these Therabreath products have changed my life!!</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash, just wish it was cheaper! Works great and lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I suffered from bad breath since I don&#x27;t know when!!!  I was ashamed to be around people and talk without a mint and gum and oh let&#x27;s not talk about waking up in the morning next to my bf!! Embarrassing!!!!!!! I went to Walgreens one day and seen this beautiful bottle and read it and tried it!! It was the best fricking $8.00 I have ever spent!!!! OMG I am confident now and I can talk whenever without gum and mints and it lasts all day long!! You guys this is really a life saver I can&#x27;t believe it works!! I don&#x27;t have a bad taste no odor and I&#x27;m just soooo happy with this product please this is such a blessing in my life right now!!! I feel confident and healthy!! Do buy if you are embarrassed or ashamed of your bad breath!!</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product.  I also buy their gum and mints from them directly.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  You will be happy with it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been suffering from tonsil stones ever since a bad case of tonsillitis in 2009. No matter what I did, I couldn&#x27;t get rid of them and they ALWAYS came back. They made my breath smell absolutely awful, and to prevent them from getting too bad I started getting into the routine of checking for tonsil stones and forcing them out every morning, which was annoying as well as painful at times. I finally tried Therabreath after reading all these reviews in a last ditch effort, and seriously guys, I&#x27;m AMAZED at the results! It&#x27;s been about a month since I started, and I have had barely any tonsil stones whatsoever. There are a few teeny tiny ones that dislodge themselves every once in awhile, but unlike before, the smell has been completely neutralized and my breath isn&#x27;t affected. This product is excellent! I only use it once a day and use far less than what is recommended on the bottle and it still works great for me. I honestly thought I was going to have my tonsils taken out in order for this problem to go away, so I am extremely excited that this a solution that works! Highly recommended, try it!!</li>
    <li> I started having bad breath about 8 months ago. No idea why. There was no change in anything (same diet, oral hygiene etc). I went to the dentist and ENT specialist. They said everything was fine. I tried different mouthwashes, nothing helped. Finally I came across a site that suggested tonsil stones as a source of bad breath. I don&#x27;t know if that is what I have, but that site also lead me to TheraBreath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the rinse about a month ago. I use it twice a day, rinse, then gargle, and the results are amazing! After about a week there was great improvement and now the bad breath is gone! It is fantastic! I just ordered more and will keep using it to make sure the bad breath does not return. I started using the toothpaste as well (I use it a few minutes after brushing with regular toothpaste first).&lt;br /&gt;I did not get any metallic taste, or aftertaste, and no loss of taste buds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it and hope it works for other people just as well!</li>
    <li> Leaves a funky aftertaste in your mouth ALL DAY. I think it&#x27;s from the castor oil in the formula. Yuck.</li>
    <li> The kids ask for this by name. Only mouth wash we&#x27;ve tried that actually works all day. Almost no taste, which we prefer. Very similar to gargling w/ peroxide but the effects last much longer. So happy to see Amazon carries this now.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough based on the other flavors of Thera Breath.</li>
    <li> I will keep it simple! This is the best mouthwash! I wake up in the am with no morning breath. It is THAT good.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash out there, I really feel like it kills bad breath unlike other products. Has a natural, non biting taste. Will continue using this for a long time! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was plagued with sinus breath for many years.  When I found Therabreath, that all changed.  No more morning breath and no more sinus breath.  I can talk with people without worrying about bad breath.</li>
    <li> I was already using the Thera Breath toothpaste and that was mild in flavor and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  I wanted to get the true benefits of the Thera Breath products so instead of using a regular mouth wash like Crest or Biotene, I decided to give this a try. This mouthwash or \\&quot;oral rinse\\&quot; as they call it is very, very mild in flavor.  The bottle says Mild Mint Flavor.  They mean MILD.  It has a very slight hint of mint, if that. It comes with a dosage cup, but I just eyeball the liquid amount into my paper cup.  The instructions say to use it as a rinse (for 1 minute) spit that out, then use another capful for gargling (30 seconds).  This \\&quot;oral rinse\\&quot; really works.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about any bad breath morning or night.  I got used to the mild or lack of mint flavoring.  Overall, I will continue to buy it and use it.</li>
    <li> No medicine taste and works thoroughly, lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Was looking forward to using this product as I have dry mouth when I sleep, but became very disillusioned after my first use. Everything I put in my mouth for over a week tasted like metal, especially water. I thought my taste buds had been altered permanently.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff!! My daughter has extremely stinky breath and not sure why. She has perfect teeth and brushes daily. But anyways, we tried a couple of different brands but nothing works as well as this. She uses before going to school in the moring and it stays with her the whole school day. We&#x27;ve bought this mulitple times and this will always be the one we buy. It&#x27;s a little pricey though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 50 year old husband who refuses to go to the dentist. I was DYING his breath smelled SO bad. I am not kidding. After the FIRST use it worked like a charm for hours. He actually blew in my face after eight hours and I smelled NOTHING. I REALLY recommend this for older people with bad breath... the truth is most old people get bad breath even if they don&#x27;t need to go to the dentist... and no one ever wants to say anything .... give them this. Breath mints never work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it works. BUT... You have to be consistent with it and gargle for the time recommended (although I do it longer) in order to &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; results (regardless if you suffer from stank breath, you should brush your teeth properly, floss regularly and be seriously disciplined about your oral regimen to maintain oral freshness). For those who suffer from halitosis, google &amp;#34;oil pulling&amp;#34; - adding that to your regimen will greatly benefit you as well. I&#x27;ve had plenty of friends convert to this brand of mouthwash, which is not harsh and barely has a flavour. I know some reviews have mentioned that the product has weakened their taste buds or has left a metallic taste in their mouths, however, I have not experienced this (although I will admit water will temporarily taste weird after initial use). I&#x27;ve tried TheraBreath&#x27;s other products and find them to be a waste of money as I didn&#x27;t notice a difference or felt it to be necessary (except for the mints, I love those!). I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now and have not looked back. Amazon so far has the best price.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> excellent for halitosis</li>
    <li> Life changing. I have battles halitosis for my entire life. I couldn&#x27;t have a conversation without the other person touching their nose or backing away. After years of searching for a solution I stumbled across this product line. Finally an explanation for my chronic condition and a solution...a simple solution. The product is bland but not bad to use. My mouth has never felt so fresh and clean. I know it works because I have been using it for three days and attended a holiday party. Well I met someone and one thing lead to another and we ended up kissing...this is something that I never would have had the confidence to do&lt;br /&gt; in the past.</li>
    <li> Love love this product. I am in the dental field and wanted to try more natural products since patients sometimes ask for recommendations. We are healthy and have good oral hygiene but I was blown away with this mouthwash. It completely gets rid of morning breath and my teeth felt cleaner. My husband went thru one bottle within 2 weeks (yikes) which can get pretty expensive. I&#x27;m glad he liked it but now he has to go buy his own bottles of this fancy mouthwash. I am trying to stretch my last bottle out but I know that I will purchase it again in the future. Very much worth the money. Wish they made bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottles and i followed directions very carefully after visiting the dentist to be cleared for any dental issues. I rinsed twice, refrained from eating and every time i rinsed I also gargles my throat separately with a different rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and behold .. NO RESULTS WHATSOEVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to work instantly. Bogus it instantly needs to be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A BIG SCAM , WASTE YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i can get my money back.</li>
    <li> Works really well, i was skeptical... leaves mouth refreshed without any odor or taste... give it a try, i&#x27;m glad i did.</li>
    <li> Just started to use this product and found it to be very helpful in reducing cankersores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just started to use this and it has been very helpful in eliminating canker sores.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but when I find an excellent product, I want to share. I have been battling with bad breath for a couple years. My dentist tells me it has to do with my internal odor from my digestive track. It was very frustrating to hear since I can&#x27;t help how the inside of my body smells. I work in healthcare where I interface with people everyday. It is important I have fresh breath. I got tired of mints &amp; gum. When I learned about TheraBreath, I tried it. The mouth wash does not have much of a taste, just a freshness. At first it changed the taste of food &amp; water, but I must be used to it now. I use it twice a day after brushing &amp; it keeps my breath all day. If you eat anything like garlic, brush &amp; rinse again after. TheraBreath  really does work &amp; I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s in my life! I no longer torment myself about bad breath. To note, I also take chlorophyll tablets daily to combat internal body odor.</li>
    <li> I tried the Therabreath for 4 months. i wanna say it is a life saver. the first 3 weeks, i noticed that the coffee and water taste terrible. But for me, the smell of my breath is more important than coffee and water.so i kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after 3-4 weeks,i used the TheraBreath one time a day only before i go to sleep at night, and it kept my breath clean for the whole next day.&lt;br /&gt;In this way, the coffee and water will no longer taste bad, and your breath will be fresh during the next day, for 24 hours!!yes 24 hours.not like other products that only last for few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU ARE A PERSON WHO CARES A LOT ABOUT BREATH SMELL, THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT IN THE MARKET.</li>
    <li> This product really works. My wife was complaining about my breath for the longest time. I tried different mouth wash, chewed gums and mints but they didn&#x27;t work. I saw this product on Groupon and gave it a try. It worked like miracle. My wife was totally amazed by it. No more bad breath! The price on Amazon is great for this product. I will recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> For years, I have been reading about how alcohol-based mouthwashes - and drinking alcohol - can be linked to throat cancer. But, Listerine works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried this and loved it, so I continued to buy it for her via Amazon, even though I thought it was expensive among its peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I made the jump, and **this stuff is great.** No burning or overpowering flavor. It leaves your mouth slightly minty, and very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a skeptic to a believer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the TRUTH! whatever you&#x27;re suffering from in your mouth. start with this,. thanks amazon for the amazing price!~</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful departure from the sweet mouthwashes available.  I got it because one reviewer stated it cured his tonsil rocks.  I have tonsil issues, too so gave this a try.  I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s fantastic stuff and seems to have, if not cured my tonsil issues, greatly improved them.  My doctor is impressed and asked what I was using. My husband loves it, too, as it&#x27;s helped his tooth pocket issues, too.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better than this mouthwash on the market. Believe me, I have tried them all. I first discovered TheraBreath when I was in college and it immediately enhanced my confidence. After suffering my entire life with halitosis, I finally found something that helped. Also, I appreciated the scientific description of halitosis that Dr. Katz put on his website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very few products have changed my life...this is one of them.</li>
    <li> I really like this mouthwash.  The taste is very different than any other mouthwash I have tried.  It is &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; but not overpowering.  It does last long and makes your mouth feel remarkably clean.  I do not use as recommended as it would deplete the bottle of the wash in about a day.  If you were to use as directed you would be going through a bottle a week.  I use one cap in the morning and one cap at night.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This product really works !!&lt;br /&gt;My children were not happy with mouthwash because it did not help with their bad breath,,, so after exploring other options we found this product.&lt;br /&gt;It really works for bad breath.</li>
    <li> For years my husband complained about my bad breath. I tried various products and some things worked. Then he asked for a divorce. I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t because of my breath b/c he said it didn&#x27;t always smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I want to start dating so I did some research on bad breath and learned about tonsil stones. I new I got them occasionally based on other people&#x27;s descriptions. About 6 weeks ago, I checked out my throat and didn&#x27;t appear to have any so I thought, maybe that&#x27;s not my problem. Then, about a week ago, I came down with a cold and got them constantly... like tons of them! Super gross, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was cleaning my tonsils with a q-tip and gargling with salt water daily. I noticed I still had one that was stuck and my tonsils continued to smell bad so I went to CVS and bought some of TheraBreath mouthwash from CVS. I gargled at 11 AM. Waited the 5 min and for the first time, when I swabbed my tonsils, they didn&#x27;t stink. I couldn&#x27;t dislodge the stone, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 7:15 pm I tried to dislodge the stone again. I got it out and it didn&#x27;t smell bad or taste bad or anything! TheraBreath had completely neutralized the smell of my tonsils and it lasted 8 hours! I&#x27;m going to use this stuff religiously. I figure I suffer from tonsil stones much the same way I get dandruff. Prevention is the best medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I noticed french kiss gum on the TheraBreath website... definitely going to buy that! ;)</li>
    <li> If only they would have had this 24 years ago when i was in high school...I have always been self conscious about my breath. This stuff works so well that even after 12 hours (without eating) this has kept my breath fresh!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that concerns me is that i get this slight metallic taste in my mouth but i prefer that to the other option. I use the toothpaste and mouthwash. I actually use the coupons that come to you, if you order from the website. Well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I wanted a mouthwash without alcohol in it and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found so far. It&#x27;s semi-powerful at freshening breath (not as powerful as regular Listerine though)</li>
    <li> It works for a few hours.  Best to brush/floss/scrape your tongue first</li>
    <li> Unique product that I highly recommend - the toothpaste and mouthwash have to be used together. The approach uses chemistry to remove sulfur/sulfides from mouth and tongue that cause bad breadth.</li>
    <li> If you have severe allergies and dry mouth, this is the stuff for you.  It gets rid of allergy and dry mouth breath!!  You will feel confident with your breath if you use this daily.  The spray stuff that you swallow is good too.. and you can put those in your purse and use throughout the day.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.. just have someone you love smell your breath after you use it.  I am sure they will agree that your breath smells great!</li>
    <li> I read many of the negative reviews on here before still trying out this product. I think it is just what I needed. It is not as powerful as I feel like the advertising alludes to, but it gets the job done. I have zero allergy issues with this piece that dry anything out and no taste sensations or lack-there-of. I think this product is well positioned and prices and works to keep breath fresh without being as harsh and senseless as something like Listerine. I also take care to note ingredients and am happy to say this product, to me, doesn&#x27;t contain anything I would mind washing my mouth with.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth. Works well.</li>
    <li> Made a big difference.</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash I have ever used I think the results were amazing and my wife agrees. I had bad breath for a couple years and have tried many products None worked. This one used only twice a day (morning and night) fixed my bad breath.</li>
    <li> Best mouth wash hands down!</li>
    <li> Gf says my breath smells better since I started using it.  I will never use mouthwash with alcohol in them again.</li>
    <li> I bought Therabreath hoping it would cut down on tonsil stones. I was getting a horrible sore throat every couple of months because of them. People had mentioned Therabreath. As soon as I started using it, I started to have abdominal cramping. So, I stopped using it for awhile, and I thought maybe it was something unrelated. However, I used it just last night, and I had the same digestive problems. I noticed that it has castor oil in it. This was used (and still is) as a common remedy for constipation. I don&#x27;t know if the hydrogenation changes the effects of the castor oil, but needless to say, I am now highly leery of this product. Additionally, it hasn&#x27;t done anything to prevent tonsil stones. I&#x27;m still getting them. It is not worth the money, folks!</li>
    <li> I have never had anything like this. water has a different taste somehow lol&lt;br /&gt;but Seriously this is a steal. Grab it if you can.</li>
    <li> One bottle came in open and not full. Even the cap is wet. It seems that it&#x27;s used already.&lt;br /&gt;I can only use the other one.</li>
    <li> Received order yesterday and have used it for two days now.  Very pleased with taste and aftertaste.</li>
    <li> I also got some oral rinse from their original web.  The product was ok, nothing special.  Did not work thought.  But the customer service was very bad.  Lot of mistake and they ignore emails.  Be aware of this TheraBreath seller.</li>
    <li> Used it for about a week and so far I can tell a major difference in my mouth! No more tonsil stones and all together fresher breath!</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this because of all the reviews. When I received it, I was skyping my Mom and I mentioned it to her. She asked what flavor it was, so I showed her the bottle. She saw the picture of the dentist in the back and said &amp;#34;oh, it&#x27;s man flavored&amp;#34;.... and it stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man-flavored mouthwash is pretty darn awesome! It does NOT sting, but also gives you all the freshness you get from other mouthwash that set your mouth on fire. It honestly makes gargling a pleasant experience!</li>
    <li> Rather expensive for what it gives you. A lot less minty than I expected, and no noticeable increase in freshness over name brand products that sell for much less</li>
    <li> these are great.  It leaves my mouth feeling a bit wierd at first.  But after couple weeks, my breath is fresher than ever.  Definitely coming back to get more</li>
    <li> Works well. Light punch of flavor, my 5 yo can use it np.</li>
    <li> We like this mouthwash. Timely delivery.  Great price--better than in most stores.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s breath was seriously unbearable and socially embarrassing. This has completely solved the problem. He had tried everything prior to this, including surgery for a deviated septum thinking it might have been a problem with his sinuses. This was the last straw before he went to get his tonsils and adenoids removed, and we are so grateful for this product. Please, don&#x27;t ever stop making it or change the formula, or give people notice so we can stock up on a lifetime supply.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but it&#x27;s been about a month since he started using it, and he just went to use it and it reminded me of how grateful I am that we found this. I thought I should &#x27;give back&#x27; by writing a review. Thanks *so* much for creating and marketing this.</li>
    <li> I use TheraBreath twice a day and it does wonders.  It gives your mouth a different kind of clean than you would get from regular mouth washes.  TheraBreath isn&#x27;t harsh, it has a really mild mint flavor but my mouth feels clean and bad breath isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> does not keep your mouth fresh not even 15 minutes!!</li>
    <li> Its a nice rinse but it definitely does not last 12 hours.  I tried this because its claim was to reduce dry mouth.  In my experience it did nothing of the sort.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have never known any mouthwash to work this well. IT ANNIHILATES BAD BREATH. Also, it really does stop morning breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too expensive, but it saved my marriage so...</li>
    <li> Well worth the money but buy in bulk it is the only way to go. I am very pleased with the mints, oral rinse &amp; toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. It gets rid of bad breath. Even really bad breath. It also does what people complain about. It dulls your taste buds for a little while. Why people would complain about that I can&#x27;t understand. It&#x27;s great for diets. Rinse with it just before going to a party.:) you will have pleasant breath, and less desire to pig out on fatty apps!!</li>
    <li> Like this product very much. Have been using for several years.</li>
    <li> Cool oral rinse, it really prevent me frm mor breath.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have developed a problem with bad breath first thing in the morning, but this helps tremendously.  I gargle this the night before and I notice a significant improvement the next morning.  I also use after brushing my teeth and flossing in the morning for an extra kick of freshness.  I prefer this over traditional mouthwashes as though those provide a boost in freshness, I just don&#x27;t feel it has quite the same effect as TheraBreath.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an amazing product to remove bad breath, look no farther. TheraBreath is amazing and works faster and better than ANYTHING else I&#x27;ve ever discovered. It&#x27;s a five star product (maybe six stars) in a one star bottle. The only reason I gave this review e stars is the cheap plastic top of the bottles like to break off. I&#x27;ve had two bottles arrive broken from shipping and I&#x27;ve broken two bottles in everyday use. Unacceptable for such an extraordinary product. Love the mouth rinse. Hate the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my previous review, the packaging has been changed with sturdier bottle tops. I now give this product five stars because I can not give it more. A fantastic product recommended without reservation</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is amazing.  I really like that it doesn&#x27;t burn and keeps your breath fresh for the better part of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it myself.</li>
    <li> Had horrible, disgusting tonsil stones.  This is the first product I found that really helps.  I saw other reviews that warned of a bad metallic taste in their mouth so I was a little cautious at first but at least for myself I never experienced any problems with that.</li>
    <li> I have a very good sense of smell and really have a hard time with smelly breath.  My hubby and I on a whim tried this brand out about six years ago and we have never bought another brand of mouthwash since.  Seriously, this stuff works wonders.  I will say that there is a strange taste to it and it seems like I am gargling peroxide with a slight minty flavor to it....and I fight gagging every time I use it.  It is quite wretched for me, but my husband says that I am strange and that it is fine.  Disclaimer, I hate peroxide toothpastes too due to gagging reflex from it.  When my hubby rinses with it...I am all his!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now. It ABSOLUTELY works. I have always been self conscious of my bad breath. This really does what it says it will. I use it every morning and sometimes at night too. Make sure you tongue scrape too. I&#x27;m happy I found it at a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product!!!  I tried it the 1st day, and it made me really sick.  I had a nasty metallic aftertaste in my mouth, nausea, and a headache that will not go away.  I spoke with customer service, and thankfully they will give me my refund.  I will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> For years I have suffered w/ bad breath. It made my social life go down the drain. I was worried about my breath rather than the conversation, and I tried EVERYTHING and nothing worked. But finally I found this product. let me to tell you, its a miracle worker. i never worry about my breathe anymore. i am more social and actually am happier. if you&#x27;re reading this and thinking thats nice but I have really bad breath and it wont work for me. LISTEN I PROMISE IT WILL WORK ON EVEN THE WORST BAD BREATH IN THE WORLD!!!!! im telling you its a miracle worker. i cant thank whoever made this enough. it has changed my life and im happier. it honestly doesnt burn your mouth at all, doesnt smell, doesnt taste like anything, its like water but does SOOOO much more. i HIGHLY suggest u buy it. I know the price is a little high but i promise its worth it</li>
    <li> now my wife doesn&#x27;t have an excuse to kiss me.. my breath is either neutral or slightly minty. Thanks Dr Katz</li>
    <li> it is pricey but it does a very good job of cleaning the mouth and leaving you with a fresh breath for the entire day.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried all kinds of products for his bad breath He&#x27;s tried eliminating coffee from his diet, and he&#x27;s tried all the things the dentist has recommended like tongue scraping. Nothing worked. He finally discovered this product and figured he&#x27;d try it. It worked immediately. It is not a harsh or chemically tasting mouthwash. It feels very light and fresh, and doesn&#x27;t sting your mouth. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> For the past year or two, my husband mysteriously developed bad breath.  We couldn&#x27;t understand how this happened, as he always had such good fresh breath ever since I&#x27;ve known him.  We thought maybe it was dry mouth, or maybe related to sinus issues, or possibly related to his use of a breathing machine for sleep apnea.  We tried all sorts of remedies to address his breath, but would never go entirely away.  Anyways, whatever the cause was, Dr Katz&#x27;s rinse GOT RID OF IT IMMEDIATELY.  After the very first time of us, his breath smelled \\&quot;normal\\&quot; again.  After the first week of use, his bad breath never really came back again.  It&#x27;s as if Dr. Katz&#x27;s rinse killed off whatever mystery bacteria was in my husband&#x27;s mouth that caused his odor.  And even now, my husband doesn&#x27;t use this regularly...probably a few times a week for \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; and his breath is wonderful right now.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  There IS HOPE!</li>
    <li> Good mouthwash, its mild (I don&#x27;t like the after taste), no burning like Listerine though. Downside is the price. Its more than double the cost of other brands, AND you only get half as much?? The current price is two 16oz bottles for $15.34 (up about $2 from the original price), or four 16oz bottles for $69.95????? If they cost half as much as they do now, I would have rated five stars.</li>
    <li> Awesome from the first use!!! Love this product. We have had great results from the dentist too. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Buy this. I started using this product in conjunction with the perio therapy toothpaste. After using Crest pro health for a couple months, and discovering it was destroying the inside of my mouth and causing me to lose taste buds. Yikes. I switched to this and it works. Dry mouth- gone. Bad breath-gone. And I have taste buds again woo hoo! Not to mention the taste is really mild but refreshing. I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash! It has mild mint taste that is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t sting.  My issues with tooth sensitivity and burning mouth have made other mouthwashes too painful to use.  This one does the trick without the pain and keeps my breath fresh all day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Now its for me to say that I do not eat onions or garlic or heavy ethnic food to start with.  And I dont have any gingivitis etc and I do have good oral hygiene. .  My girlfriend always says my breathe was always good but recently I wanted to find something to make it ever better - for her!  So I got this.  And the first time I used it she could tell how even more clean it tasted. She started using it too.  Now if you do a lot of deep kissing your gonna love this.....and your wifey or GF will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But - now I just came from the dentist today and I asked about it. And they looked it up and they said I may not protect against Gingivitis.  So i read the label and it may not have that. So - she said to use a common Listerine for healthy gums and this about 1hr later and the rest of the day.  Maybe space them out about 2hrs apart.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing man! I was suffering from tonsil stones also and the dreaded \\&quot;poop breath\\&quot;; I did everything I could to remove the smell; I would literally brush my teeth and scrub my tongue for half an hour, just to make sure I cleaned out all the gunk! it still wasn&#x27;t enough! I was kissing a girl the other day and she said my breath stank! it frusterated the s*** out of me because I would spend so much time brushing my teeth and tongue! the final straw came when I was brushing my teeth and I coughed out a white ball; I remembered coughing up a white ball when I was 13 and I remembered it smelling like s***! after hours of researching I finally found out they were tonsil stones and I learned that tonsil stones were a major cause of bad breath! thank god I finally found out what was giving me bad breath all this time! now I had to get to the next hardest part.... finding the cure to it! after about a week of research and stinky breath-ness I finally came across therabreath! praise the lord! hallejujah! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say therabreath works wonderfully! I just gargled for like 2 minutes in the back of my throat and the odor of my breath has decreased significantly! my breath bad meter has dropped from a 6 down to a 3! oh wait.... I just smelt it 20 more times to make sure lol my bad breath meter has went from a 6 out of 10 to a 2.5 out of 10! my bad breath is barely noticeable, in fact..... its pretty much cleared away! I have bearable breath now! lol definantly a huge progress from poop breath! ill keep using this to see where it goes but yeahh, this stuff works great! I would recommend this to anybody who suffers from bad breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you da man dr. katz! lol Listerine and colgate need to take notes from you lol</li>
    <li> This product has saved my professional life. My meetings, one-on-one&#x27;s were uncomortable for years, starting chewing gum but that didnt look professional.</li>
    <li> love it. though should say, NOT your typical fire-minty mouthwash. it works with an herbal formulation which you cant taste, but really works shockingly well.  we&#x27;re used to mouthwashes that burn and sting to know they are working but this is way more subtle.  it could even use a little mint for a nice after kick but mainly it works. you just have to try it. buy one bottle 1st because they are expensive.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash works! I have awful breath (2 dentists, 2 doctors, + lab tests can&#x27;t tell me why) but Therabreath makes me comfortable to go out in public and talk without turning away from the perish I am speaking to. Once after brushing is good for many hours, (I use the breath spray if it is more than 8 hrs. Since I gargled.)</li>
    <li> As my husband and I age so does our breath.  This is great and long lasting.  We just use 1/2 the recommended amount to gargle with as it is a bit pricey.  On our last check ups our dentist  commented that he thinks it is working..he also likes biotene mouthwash.  We have both and combine them.</li>
    <li> Awful - truly. I can only describe it as fizzy caster oil. If you liked Listerine, you will be totally dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only mouth wash that works for me, it&#x27;s magic.  Follow the instructions and scrape your tongue otherwise it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> My family always told me i had the breath of a rotting dead animal-this is a miracle worker!!!!  The problem is solved-my husband said it is the greatest product in the world!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this magical elixir is, and I don&#x27;t care.  Buy it now.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  A few weeks ago I suddenly developed a severe case of dragon breath.  I am also a teacher.  Since I actually care about my students and didn&#x27;t want them to keel over when I talked to them, I started eating breath mints like it was my job.  I think I have upped Altoids&#x27; profits this year.  Anyhow, this product came up as a &amp;#34;daily deal&amp;#34;, and I clicked on it.  Little did I know how it would transform my life IN A DAY.  Seriously.  Used it last night, again this morning before I left for school, and I just realized I didn&#x27;t eat one mint all day.  I can&#x27;t even believe it.  I didn&#x27;t even go overboard and use two capfuls multiple times a day....yadda yadda like they say on the directions.  I&#x27;m not made of money, so I can&#x27;t burn through this stuff THAT fast.  They even suggest dipping your floss in it.  Nope, too much work.  All I&#x27;m saying is use it at night (the way I usually use Listerine) &#x3D; no morning dragon breath.  Use it after brushing as you head out the door &#x3D; no day dragon breath.  I should have bought a case.</li>
    <li> great product, recommend</li>
    <li> Have had no tonsil problems when using this product. If you still have your tonsils, you should try it!</li>
    <li> I am sold on this stuff. Before I started using TheraBreath mouthwash I was often self-conscious of my breath. I would tend to speak quietly or avoid pointing my mouth directly at the person while talking. It made social situations difficult and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final straw came when I was on a date and sitting on this woman&#x27;s couch and felt like I couldn&#x27;t directly interact with her even though she was obviously interested. That&#x27;s when I started my search for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution came quickly since Amazon reviews led me almost instantly to this product. I use it twice daily and ALWAYS feel secure about my breath now. This product is fantastic!!! No more bad breath and I&#x27;m not just covering it up with over-powering mint. No, this stuff actually gets rid of the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy this - it really changed my life :-)</li>
    <li> I live with dry mouth due to prescriptions medications.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product, use twice a day.</li>
    <li> My mouth got very dry every time I used the product, so I had to stop using it and returned it back to the manufacturer. The product did help to kill bad odor causing bacteria.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash really works as claimed!  We are very pleased with this product and happy that we can purchase it through Amazon.  Drug store prices are much higher.</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on the TheraBreath, I&#x27;ll be in touch on tis rinse.</li>
    <li> The prices for the Therabreath Oral rinse vary between $8 and $11 from store to store. Online, buying the pack of two is the best deal so far. If you haven&#x27;t used this rinse before, the flavor takes a little getting used to. I like how it is alcohol free and does not burn my mouth. It is recommended to use with the toothpaste (same brand--no deals here at Amazon) at least two times per day, so you will go through the bottle faster. I follow this oart of the plan. It is nice to go to bed with a good taste in my mouth, however, the rinse says that it fights or stops morning breath. I still have a \\&quot;morning taste\\&quot; when I wake up, but my teeth feel clean.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is amazing! Relieves dry mouth instantaneously and provides fresh breath.  Just tried the mints and am addicted to those too! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Better than any other mouth wash. It wont cause any acidic reactions or burns, unlike all the other mouth washes out there, this one is has a PH closer to water.&lt;br /&gt;Dont get me wrong, its most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Dont rinse your mouth with water after using Therabreath as specified. You wont be left with a disturbing or strong taste, if so... it wont last long. This way it tends to be more effective and lasts way longer</li>
    <li> I use this mouthwash along with the toothpaste.  works for me! Just follow the directions.</li>
    <li> great product but the price is steep</li>
    <li> Been using it for years and it&#x27;s the only mouthwash I have found that really works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This rinse seems a lot like mild hydrogen peroxide -- with non-offensive flavoring and no burn. It does alleviate bad breath caused by occasional gum or throat problems. It&#x27;s too expensive to use every day without a real bad breath issue, so I use a little colloidal silver in water to gargle when I feel a sore throat coming on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with bad breath..even after I brushed my teeth.. I had this embarrassing moment when I was talking to someone.. Right in the middle of my convo she stopped me and asked who farted??&lt;br /&gt;of course no one farted it was just my bad breath.. Smh&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing, it didn&#x27;t leave my mouth with an over powering mint smell like scope did..my mouth feels and smells really clean. I&#x27;m in love with this.. Not to mention my 9 ur old with bad breath who hates mint.. Loves this product too.</li>
    <li> I thought this product wouldn&#x27;t work but I was wrong. Thank you this stuff works.</li>
    <li> This product has a lot of great reviews, but if you look closely you&#x27;ll see that they are all for bad breath.  I have very severe dry mouth due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.  This product does almost nothing to help with my dry mouth.  It lacks all of the recommended ingredients for a dry mouth rinse (ex., xylitol, carboxymethyl cellulose, or hydroxyethyl cellulose).  A much more suitable dry mouth rinse is Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse.</li>
    <li> I didnt really have bad breath but had a sour taste in my mouth when I woke up. On using this with their paste as well, i wake up with no taste in my mouth.</li>
    <li> very unsatisfied. this is the weakest mouthwash i&#x27;ve ever used. i rather go with the regular brands next time. this is the last time i&#x27;d ever purchase this product. i&#x27;m actually close to just pouring it down the drain. i&#x27;m not even exaggerating</li>
    <li> What can I say that hasn&#x27;t already been said - this rinse is amazing. One use and you will be a believer too. I should get a commission for how many overnight guests try it and then end up buying it themselves.</li>
    <li> I have permanently swollen tonsils which cause me to have extremely bad breath.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mouthwashes over the years, none have worked very well.  Oftentimes I have to wake up in the middle of the night to rinse my mouth and gargle with water because otherwise the taste in my mouth keeps me from falling back to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therabreath is AMAZING stuff.  I can go to bed, sleep for 8 hours, wake up and not have morning breath!  If you struggle with bad breath you need to give this stuff a shot!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how amazing this stuff works. No burning, just fizzing and leaves your mouth with a neutral flavor so it won&#x27;t mess with eating shortly afterwards. For the price its amazing and have no reason to switch to another brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great mouthwash that delivers as promised -- particularly when paired with TheraBreath Toothpaste.  Both are very mild and can be used comfortably during the healing phases of any dental procedures as they are alcohol free.  I find them to be particularly effective when used at night to eliminate &amp;#34;morning breath.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this stuff... it works way better than any other mouthwash on the market. The price is the only reason everyone is not using this all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its mild yet very effective. Great minty taste that lingers and refreshes the mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again (and have)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than the alcohol based mouth washes. my only problem is it goes pretty fast and its pricey....the instructions indicate using it more than twice a day...is Oral Rinse a fancy name for mouth wash?</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do without being overpowering, without burning. Won&#x27;t use anything else now</li>
    <li> Works eliminate dragon breath!</li>
    <li> Makes my mouth feel fresh and clean, but didn&#x27;t do much for my breath - SmartMouth is better at fresher breath.  I do like this product though; just not as effective as expected.</li>
    <li> Pricey, and went through it too quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I took a look at the description and it says, &amp;#34;Neutralizes sulfur-producing bacteria. destroys morning breath &amp; food odor&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m calling b******t.  So the company is telling me, if you&#x27;re breadth smells like rotten eggs (sulfur), this will kill the bacteria making it... right... wouldn&#x27;t this be called an antibiotic then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m not the most knowledgeable on bacteria, but I do know a little about it (I&#x27;m a second year medical student).  If your breadth smells like rotten eggs, you&#x27;ve got issues.  Might that stench be from your diet, a diverticulum, or some other issue?  Does this stuff just mask up that smell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, luckily my mouth doesn&#x27;t smell like ass.  I use this to cover up my coffee breath and post lunch meal funk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a very neutral taste to it.  I decided to go back to the cheap store stuff.</li>
    <li> Leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. It works.</li>
    <li> Very nice and great product! It works!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product from Wal-Mart last week after seeing so many positive reviews.  However, I should&#x27;ve read the 1 star reviews first before buying it.  I am sitting here dying of thirst as I speak as I am guzzling down bottles of water.  I have never been so thirsty in my life and was considering being tested for diabetes as I have never experience thirst to this extent ever before in my life.  Also, it leaves an odd metallic taste in your mouth for the entire day and my tongue feels numb.  I mean even water taste bad!.  I will NOT be using this again, It gives you terrible dry mouth.  I will just brush and floss more often.  This stuff is awful and very expensive!!!!!!  Hopefully I will be able to find my receipt so I can get a refund.</li>
    <li> Recently bought this for son who is plagued with sinus issues all winter long.  The abundance of post nasal drip gives him very bad breath.  This is the only oral rinse we have found to completely rid him of bad breath.  He went away for the weekend and when he returned I could tell instantly that he didn&#x27;t take the mouthwash along.  This stuff seems to really work well for bad breath due to sinus related issues.</li>
    <li> The directions did mention that you may notice a sour taste for a few days, I guess until you get adjusted to it.  Well, I&#x27;m in that period now.  It definitely adds a new level of freshness and I will continue to use it in hopes that the sour taste subsides</li>
    <li> I never had a problem with bad breath but my wife said things changed, and I have no idea why.  We researched causes and cures, and tried everything - nothing worked.  I saw this in the store and tried it.  Problem solved.  I don&#x27;t normally take the time to review things, but this product worked so well, it deserves my recommendation.  And even though it&#x27;s more expensive than regular mouthwash, I&#x27;m saving the difference in the breath mints that I don&#x27;t have to buy.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e spent  numerous amounts of money on oral care relating bad breathe, after consitiently taking therabreath i can talk to people without holding my hand over my mouth or backing away awkwardly.</li>
    <li> I hate the strong taste most of the other mouthwashes have... This one has a very unique one, but not bothersome. And it works better than any other, it really leaves your mouth clean for many hours.</li>
    <li> This rinse is worth the money spent. If you suffer from dry mouth or bad breath it will help. Follow the instructions on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Wow it really works.... Some how i started getting tonsil which reappeared almost all the time for two months... I checked the reviews and thought may be give it a try... I use them only at night.... And my tonsil stones are cleared out completely.... Really a great product... No burning sensation in mouth... You can easily goggle for a minute... Very mild taste ... but works great....</li>
    <li> Mildly minty, somewhat effervescent. Might deserve an extra star for being pretty much unsweetened.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly too effervescent to work well in the SonicCare AirFloss.</li>
    <li> I really like this mouthwash. There&#x27;s no alcohol, so no burning when you use it. It&#x27;s gentle but it really freshens my breath. I use it before bed and my breath is still fresh when I wake up in the morning. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> This is our favorite mouthwash. It is a little expensive, but we have not found any other product that is as effective. Most of the time Amazon has the cheapest price, unless your local drug store is having a sale. It gives you fresh breath that lasts a long time with a slightly minty taste. We have been hooked on TheraBreath since we saw Dr. Katz give a demonstration on a local news station.</li>
    <li> I have a condition known as Burning Mouth Syndrome.  The TheraBreath products are the only ones I can use that don&#x27;t burn my tongue.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the confidence I gain with this product. I like the taste, which to me is very,very,very mild &amp; bubbly. You can feel it working in your mouth. I use this in conjunction with the toothpaste, and sometimes the mints. Make sure to take the time to read the directions.....for the most effective use of this pricey product you need to follow the method listed. Typical mouthwash was of no or negitive effect to me, so this product is great! I like it so much I got my tween daughter this and the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Awesome but too pricey!</li>
    <li> I discovered this product accidently one day at my favorite grocery store and decided to try it because another well known brand I was using was leaving a thick film in my mouth, I just couldn&#x27;t take it any longer. With the particular sleep medication I take dries my mouth out so bad, I was getting pretty desperate . So one day, sitting next to this other brand, I see Dr. Katz, a bit more pricey, but what was the alternative?  I took it home and three years later!  It sooths my dry mouth in only 30 seconds.  I gargle with it and it cleans and refreshes my throat also without alcohol.  I never start my day or go to bed without using my Dr. Katz. He made me a believer and  long time customer!  I hope he makes a Gallon size jug soon!</li>
    <li> it is so safe for kids too.  I put half of usual amount and mix with a lot of water for my kid to spit out after brushing their teeth.  Their breath smells amazing, too.</li>
    <li> Mild-tasting, but leaves my mouth fresh for hours. It eliminates bad morning breath. The price is very good, also. Thanks for offering it on the subscription plan.</li>
    <li> Had been using Biotene, but it was discontinued from the subscribe and save si thought we would try this....Thin, medicinal taste, not nearly enough to help dry mouth. Wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered two packages (total of four 16 oz. bottles) Will probably end up puting them in the food shelf box at the store.</li>
    <li> No booze in this breath freshener but it still does the trick without the kick. A pleasant taste and a nice 3rd step in teeth maintenance; brush, waterpik, and then swish a sip of this gargle rinse...you&#x27;ll feel like a new mouth :)</li>
    <li> I was really blown away by this mouthwash.  I am currently near the end of my second bottle and I am hooked!  I also now use the toothpaste.  The flavor is extremely mild, just a hint of mint.  Both my 8 year old daughter and I use this with happy results.  It really eliminates bad breath.  About an hour after I use this in the morning, i finish off my cup of coffee and I don&#x27;t really have the bad coffee breath flavor in my mouth.  I told a co worker about this, she has a condition, her mouth is aways dry and  sees a dr about this.  She says this product has changed her life and in fact she produces so much saliva now she chokes on it a little....that sounds gross, it is not meant to be!  I tell everyone about this and wish I  knew about it ten years ago.</li>
    <li> I used Dr. Ken&#x27;s mint mouthwash for years. I had ordered the 3 packs of it 5 times from Amazon, but for some reason the product isn&#x27;t as readily or cheaply available. I tried quite a few of different ones. This Dr. Katz was as close to the Dr. Kens as I could find. The main thing that caught my eye is &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; mint, which is what I loved about Dr. Kens. I don&#x27;t like mouthwash that lingers with a strong minty flavor. I&#x27;ll continue to use this Dr. Katz, though I buy it from that Walton store, where it&#x27;s actually cheaper than here. Maybe someone is looking for a replacement for Dr Kens mint, based on my taste buds, I would say this is the closest.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, Ill definitly buy other again , it looks as it will  last for ever great buy,thanks again amazon for a great product</li>
    <li> Bad after taste! I read the reviews about the bad after taste but I bought therabreath hoping it wouldn&#x27;t be my experience, but it was.  The first time I used the mouthwash I liked it, but after using it twice it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I tried using other mouth washes to get rid of it, but they did not help. It even makes water taste bad. I would not buy this product. The after taste is not worth it!</li>
    <li> This really cured my bad breath.  I use their toothpaste as well.  This completely eradicates bad breath.  I buy this all the time.  I had very bad breath and this fixed it 100%</li>
    <li> I ordered the mouthwash along with the toothpaste, mints, and lozenges from the direct site. The mouthwash was ok, but its effects unfortunately didn&#x27;t last more than an hour. The toothpaste tasted absolutely horrible, to the point where i dreaded brushing my teeth every morning and night! The mints and lozenges tasted bad too. Therefore, for the price of the mouthwash, it is absolutely not worth the effects. I will not be reordering these products any longer.</li>
    <li> was amazed with this rinse, would recommend it to anyone who eats gralic&lt;br /&gt;it delivers what it says it will</li>
    <li> I approve!  (comes with a little pack of 4 mints too)</li>
    <li> Simply the best out there. No fancy gimmicks no dazzled bottle colors or designs, just good old fashion RESULTS! Trust you will not be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a mouthwash without alcohol and an overly minty taste, so i decided to try this.  for the first few days, everything tasted really salty to me and i was ready to stop using the product.  i read that it&#x27;s normal, so i continued using it.  it passed and now all foods taste normal to me.  there is peppermint oil in it, but the flavor is so subtle, it&#x27;s almost nonexistent.  i like this mouthwash and it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> My family eats a lot of \\&quot;strong\\&quot; foods, i.e. raw onions, garlic, etc.  So, I can tell you that we have tried all sort of different \\&quot;bad breath\\&quot; products.  Let my just tell you that this really works.  Now when it comes to garlic, it does not completely remove all traces, but compared to any other product it works very well.  As for daily use, if you use it as directed, it works great.  The most important feature of this product is the fact that is is SO MILD, you almost can not believe that it is not just flavored water!!!</li>
    <li> This really works. Fresh breath that lasts a long time. Cuts through the coffee and cigarettes I compulsively use with ease. Also good for those closet drinkers; people at work don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m drinking;)</li>
    <li> Works extremely well. Morning breath was indeed eliminated.</li>
    <li> Actually works great!</li>
    <li> worth the price.. this oral rinse / mouthwash really works &amp; delivers all it promises! You should use as directed for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Can effectively improve the tone</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from bad breath for a while now, and nothing was helping. I now found out that it&#x27;s from H. Pylori that I picked up while traveling abroad. I got this fully based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells much better than it tastes (although it&#x27;s not made to swallow). It doesn&#x27;t taste great, but not bad...almost like nothing with an ever slight taste of mint. It really works! In the morning I don&#x27;t have a breath, and I don&#x27;t have a minty fresh breath either, I just simply don&#x27;t have breath to smell. I got the twin back and I must say it&#x27;s worth  it. And realizing that the label says: kosher, not tested on animals, natural ingredients, and made in the USA...really makes me a dedicated costumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although health comes from within, this is certainly a good start for helping bad breath quickly. I truly love this product and I will recommend this product in a heartbeat over the alcohol burn, and artificial flavorings of the conventional mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it definitely works as advertised.  I would not waste my money on any other mouthwash because they do not last.  This product is worth every penny.  No wonder it is the #1 mouthwash seller on Amazon!</li>
    <li> It is so nice. You can&#x27;t know before using this!&lt;br /&gt;I love this and will buy more for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Dr.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work. Long-time customer and any time I have to use a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; mouthwash I just wonder how people can even deal with it. Not only is the TheraBreath almost completely flavorless, but it doesn&#x27;t sting, burn, or have a strange aftertaste. Whereas stuff like Scope, Listerine, etc. has a minty aftertaste, there is nothing to taste after rinsing with this -- exactly why I like it. It doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you just rinsed your mouth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend following the directions or you won&#x27;t have the same success I do. Most people just rinse for a few seconds, but with TheraBreath you really need to swish/gargle for a good 30-60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When do I use this? After I brush and floss, and for &amp;#34;touch-ups&amp;#34; before I&#x27;m about to go out with a lady. ;-)</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Better than anything in a drug store.Repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Mild Mint tastes so mild, almost like water but it works so good! Now I don&#x27;t have to rinse my mouth with water so many times after, saves time and water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my decision to try this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant on trying this due to the reviews that I read about a metallic flavor that lingers for most of the day and makes drinking water or eating food really hard due to the awful taste...  Well, I have not experienced anything like that whatsoever.  I experience a fresh, very mild minty flavor (hence the name I guess lol) that leaves my mouth feeling clean. Not calling any one a liar, just sharing my experience.To each their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this on a regular basis for as long as I feel that I need it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a low carb, high meat and fat guy.  Since I switched my diet about two years ago, my breath has been pretty vile.  My family has not varied from the opinion that I have a hard-to-describe foul miasma around my head.  My wife characterized it as \\&quot;old man smell\\&quot;.  I have tried different chlorophyll-like pills, minty pills, gargles, etc., to no avail (I&#x27;m not willing to stop the diet--it&#x27;s radically improved my blood chemistry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to roll the dice on all sorts of idiotic possibilities, and Therabreath fit the bill.  When it arrived, late afternoon (so 10 hours after last brushing, and with a nice lunch in the interim), I rinsed for a minute per the directions, gargled briefly, and exhaled on my daughter, who proclaimed it \\&quot;scent-free\\&quot;.  My insanely sensitive wife --after dinner-- was blown away by the absence of nasty breath.  The big test was the next day, with rinsing in the morning and spending all day undoing it with meat, yogurt, cheese, etc.  Dinnertime-- still no smell.  Three days in, and it&#x27;s still fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild, almost non-existent taste, and the results seem to last all day.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My entire family loves every Dr Katz product we have tried. They really do eliminate halitosis! Truly amazing and we have already purchased more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and they burn my mouth. I decided to try this because of the reviews and I am glad I did. It does taste different but I&#x27;m getting used to it. It does work as well so much better than other brand.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this. It works well. When I go to sleep and wake up after using this, there is no morning breath. It feels fresh. It last throughout the day was well. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Even though I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon, i still wanted to warn you guys/girls. This mouthwash caused a very bad sore throat that lasted for up two days! It also made my saliva very thick, like mucus. Please don&#x27;t fall for the five star reviews.</li>
    <li> I feel that this mouthwash does a really great job.  I cannot say scientifically that it yellows teeth, but mine did get yellow from using this product.  Sad, because I really enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will make a formula without the yellowing problem.</li>
    <li> One of the only things that has helped ease my dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Daily use of this product will not only freshen your breath but GET RID of morning breath.  Must use daily - morning and night - to see long lasting results!  Definitely works WAY BETTER than listerine!  Worth the extra few dollars!!!</li>
    <li> gentle in the mouth, no bad taste or aftertaste.  it seems to work.  i wish there was a &amp;#34;Bad Breath Meter&amp;#34; so I could know without asking people. (and people might lie, it is a taboo thing to tell someone they have bad breath)</li>
    <li> I found out I had tonsil stones my breath is horrible and I was told it was gerd.  I can see the craters on my tonsils so after years of embarassment thought I&#x27;d do some research.  I came across this mouthwash so had my fiance order it.  After the first time using it as a gargle and mouthwash my mouth tasted to fresh no burn just a light mint flavor..clean.  Even the next morning I didn&#x27;t have that awful sour taste.  Great product I will gargle after every meal to hopefully help with my tonsil stones.  Thanks for a great product.  Linda K</li>
    <li> If you or a loved one has bad breath this product is a home run. Skip, Listerine and order this product.</li>
    <li> …this is great for lubing the mouth before bruising…after brushing it gives long lasting fresh mouth…great for quick fresh mouth at work...</li>
    <li> It works, does the Job</li>
    <li> After discovering Dr Katz toothpaste and mouth rinse a few years ago, I have never gone back to better-known commercial brands. My periodic visits to the dentist have shown a marked improvement, relative to gum health and tooth decay. In addition, I rarely have &#x27;bad breath&#x27; and feel more confident [overall] as a result.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I cant believe how well it works!!! Im obsessed. I wasn&#x27;t expecting such miraculous results, especially at such a reasonable price. BUY this. you wont regret it</li>
    <li> To my surprise this product really seems to work as advertised.  Also the taste is not harsh so even children can use it.</li>
    <li> Rinse once a day with this stuff and you won&#x27;t have to worry about your breath all day. It really works.</li>
    <li> The product eliminates bad breath immediately. The mint flavor of this mouthwash is VERY mild but way more effective than any crest/listerine or store brand I&#x27;ve tried. Often times it felt like the other brands were just covering up the breath with strong mint, however, this just eliminates the bad breath. It also has almost no burn when gargling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state to use one cupful to swish in your mouth and one cupful to gargle with your throat. So you could end up going through a bottle pretty quickly with this method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on continuing using this.</li>
    <li> I love this product works great i have no complaints, do it have a semi metallic taste yes, it doesn&#x27;t burn at all and it seems to last all day if needed</li>
    <li> We have tried numerous mouthwashes to combat bad breath, and this one beats them all.  Long lasting, no aftertaste, cures the worst bad breath.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I actually tried this when I saw it on sale at Walmart. I&#x27;d never heard of it before but the information on the packaging looked promising (and on sale, it was a heck of a buy).  It&#x27;s more of a natural solution than all the commercial mouthwashes out there,  most with artificial flavoring and preservatives.  And mouthwash doesn&#x27;t have to burn to be effective! I suffer from dry mouth and while this isn&#x27;t advertised to help with that it was a nice bonus for me that it did. Now I hear TheraBreath advertised on the radio - so the word is getting around.  I added this to my subscribe and save because the 2-pack really is a great deal - especially when you factor in an extra 20% off</li>
    <li> I like that this mouthwash does not burn at all.  It is not perfect, but it does a good job of keeping the mouth clean.</li>
    <li> I swear this gets rid of tonsil stones!</li>
    <li> Very nice mouthwash. Makes me feel really clean esp, with the mild mint flavor.</li>
    <li> Help to fresh breath.</li>
    <li> Mouth mouth feels fresh and clean without being dry. Would gladly buy it again recommend it to anyone.  Plan to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for my family over the years and it&#x27;s the best on the market!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making purchasing so easy..</li>
    <li> Dr. Katz&#x27;s rinse is the most effective rinse for halitosis I have ever tried and I have tried just about everything that is out there.I bless this man for creating TheraBreath. I could not believe that one could wake up in the morning without bad breath. It&#x27;s pricey but don&#x27;t hesitate for one minute, it&#x27;s worth every penny. I would not be caught without it. I even carry it in my purse. Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.</li>
    <li> I have had horrendous bad breath since the age of 12. I was told to brush longer (4 mins.) , floss, brush my tongue. Which I do faithfully. I still suffer from chronic bad breath to the point if I talk to someone the whole room would be consumed with my bad breath. Just horrible. Anyways I stumbled upon thera breath a couple of years ago and when I first started using it, I followed the directions to a t. It worked for a little while then my bad breath came back. So, I would stop using it, try something else, then start back using it again. One thing I have notice about thera breath is that it really helps as far as mucus build up (gross I know). I don&#x27;t spit out mucus as much as I used too. The taste of this product is exactly like water and mint. I would recommend this product to those who have bad breath but, not halitosis. It does not work for us.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used. Really kills bad breath and no alcohol sting.</li>
    <li> My husband kept complaining that my breath was bad even after I brushed my teeth, until I used TheraBreath. This stuff really passed the test!</li>
    <li> Surprised by how it works-- better than listerine.</li>
    <li> My wife complained every now and then that I had some funky breath. I don&#x27;t smoke and have a great dental record so I wasn&#x27;t sure what it was from. Anyways, I figured I try this stuff and ever since she hasn&#x27;t complained. Thanks!</li>
    <li> So mild it almost just tastes like water. Not sure if it is doing the job. Will probably go back to Periowash.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than anything else I have tried!</li>
    <li> helps reduce bad breath.  I use this once a day, right after I brush my teeth (I don&#x27;t rinse my mouth out after I brush my teeth, I just spit out the toothpaste, just like the instructions say).  I do the gargling, but I don&#x27;t use a new capful of rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the results would be even better if I did it multiple times per day and used a separate capful to gargle, but I&#x27;d just start going through this stuff way too fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for quite some time and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using other products in between and I just don&#x27;t like other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re either very strong and give you canker sores or burn your mouth, or they lack strength and don&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect as it works without a doubt, and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing to ever get rid of my husbands chronic bad breath, as well as mine. We have been using this for a little over a week. As promised, 12 hours later our breath has no offensive odor, it is simply neutral...and fresh. Your breath WILL smell like the food or drink you just ingested. Keep that in mind. That is food odor, not bad breath. We use less than the directed amount and swish first, then gargle. Gargling is important as it rids your throat of bacteria. Another benefit I noticed -- the phlegm that always seemed to be in the back of my throat is now gone. The phlegm that resides at the roof of your mouth. My throat feels very clean. Hard to expain but you will understand if you try the product! It will alter the flavor of your coffee and foods for the first week which was odd but it WILL go away if you continue to use it. That side effect is temporary. We have gotten our entire family to use this product!!</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I have used! Non-irritating, great flavor, and really does kill off that bad breath and neutralize! I love it!</li>
    <li> I had dry mouth and my GF complained a lot that I had bad breath... even after brushing. Ever since getting this product in conjunction with their toothpast that issue is completely gone. This is a great great quality product and works as described. It&#x27;s expensive but I don&#x27;t care, I just bulk up on it. Only complaint is that it does not come in a larger size. I&#x27;d buy a gallon at a time if I could!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is minty but not burning or strong. There&#x27;s another flavor (with a blue cap) which is a strong burning taste which I&#x27;d not recommend. I could not imagine not using this product now. If they went out of business I&#x27;d buy Amazon&#x27;s entire supply!</li>
    <li> I use this product with confidence knowing I am not slaying people with death breath.  It works as per my girlfriend and if you use as directed, including the flossing part, you&#x27;ll have little or no morning breath which is a good way to start the day...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have been using it for several years.  My favorite part about it is the taste.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning off my taste buds.  My mouth feels much cleaner after using it and I have plenty of people in my life who would tell me if my breath was unpleasant--so far, no one has taken me aside or given my breath a shout-out from across a crowded room.  The thing that impressed me the most is when I would have my Dad use it.  He had dementia and stopped managing his hygiene needs.  He had the worst what could best be described as dragon breath.  It was foul.  When he was in a good mood, I could get him to gargle and slosh with Therabreath and it completely obliterated his dragon breath. Sometimes, he would just slosh with it and it still took care of his mouth odor.  I haven&#x27;t ordered it from Amazon, but I might start.  I have also tried the one in the turquoise bottle.  It&#x27;s MUCH stronger in minty-ness and flavor.  I prefer the mildness of the green bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, and this one works without leaving an alcohol- or chemically-based smell. After gargling, it seems to actually neutralize bad breath instead of mask it. I keep one in the drawer at my desk to swish before meetings. Fully recommend.</li>
    <li> So good. This is a great non-alcohol based mouthwash that does the job. You can actually feel it work.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff, not a lot in the way of chemicals, mild minty taste - seems to do a great job, love it</li>
    <li> This stuff does actually work. But the night you forget to use you&#x27;ll know the next morning. I&#x27;ll keep ordering.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t tell difference as yet</li>
    <li> Fresh breath but i really dont get a clean feeling like I do with Biotene</li>
    <li> it does not work, the toothpaste works much better</li>
    <li> it really doesnt have much taste.. like water-down gatorade? but it works! my second time buying it! but toothpaste sucks</li>
    <li> I would not compare this to Listerine. Its simply not in the same class. Listerine is a 3rd level mouthwash, this is Level One. It is not a surprise that it cannot be found in Stores. Listerine leaves this after taste and as far as I am concerned does not clean very well especially if you have wisdom teeth. This mouthwash is clear almost like using water, yet it is very effective.</li>
    <li> This is a much gentler mouthwash than the ones most of us are used to - Listerine, Scope, etc.  Instead of an in-your-face, sharp, hardly-bearable wash, the freshness in TheraBreath is more subtle - and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way I can describe this feeling is like peppermint tea - but without the tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fiancee hated it when I used Listerine.  It was just too intense, sweet, overwhelming.  But she also hated coffee breath, which left me in a tight spot.  I don&#x27;t have especially terrible breath, but I needed something all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It completely cleans your breath - coffee, cigars, pad-thai - all gone. But It does it without replacing it with that terrible, pseudo-sweet listeriney taste. It&#x27;s an easy, subtle, but effective way to refresh your breath.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Horrible, no discerable taste and did not make my mouth feel fresh.  I would not get this again, ever!  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> My breath has definitely smelled better since I started using this mouthwash, and my dentist has commented that my gingival tissue looks healthier as well.</li>
    <li> this product is incredible!! it does exactly as promised. it is def. worth the money. i would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
    <li> Meh...I think it does the job, but it leaves an &#x27;aftertaste&#x27; and changes the way everything tastes. Now everything I drink or eat tastes &#x27;salty.&#x27; Must affect the tastebuds somehow. No thanks, ... I&#x27;ll stick to my Listerine.</li>
    <li> Certainly the most unique mouthwash I have ever tasted. Without the burning sensation, it manages to keep your breath smelling fresh for much longer! Can&#x27;t go back to regular mouthwash!</li>
    <li> Neutralizes even garlic, onions, and tuna (!) and doesn&#x27;t leave one smelling of alcohol. The flavor is quite subtle unlike the usual mouthwashes. Febreeze for the mouth, but less harmful to the environment and one&#x27;s health. This is one product to keep on hand. Thank you, Dr. Katz, for inventing this.</li>
    <li> Well....I was skeptical when I first tried it but I am convinced this is the best mouthwash out there. Doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth and keeps breath fresh for a long time....at least that is my wife says! Daughter likes it too! No more &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; mouth in the morning.</li>
    <li> Not only does it eliminate morning breath but it also fights tonsil stones. I had been struggling with tonsil stones and this is the only viable solution I have found short of getting a tonsillectomy. Hands down the best mouth wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> A little background.. I&#x27;m a dental hygienist who has suffered w tonsil stones for a whole now I figured 6 months ago I&#x27;d try it out and see what can come of these terrible things in the back of my throat.. Well clearly I am obsessive compulsive w my teeth flossing EVERY night brushing 2-3 times a day and changed my rinse.... To this from the ACT fluoride one . Yes to say the least I have been having some issues of sensitivity so after two months of thinking it was my sinuses I took a few bite wings .. To my dismay I have two may be three CAVITIES. the product worked for the tonsil stones a little but as a professional DO NOT use this as the only rinse.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so dope! I don&#x27;t use it all the time, like they suggest, but it truly gets rid of bad breath. It saved a relationship for me once. Turns out she was just mean anyway, so it didn&#x27;t last, but not because my breath stunk.</li>
    <li> Does what they say, without exception.</li>
    <li> This product contains bleach</li>
    <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found that tames the beast!  Other mouthwashes may be better for gum health, etc, but this stuff really, really works.</li>
    <li> Mild flavor but leaves your mouth feeling very very clean!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for oral rinse/mouthwash.  I think it works good and it feels so fresh.  Will highly recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brand.  It&#x27;s effective.  It&#x27;s mild.  It&#x27;s long lasting.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth as others had.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It&#x27;s becoming more difficult to find in stores so I&#x27;m thankful that it&#x27;s available from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works well long term but has a bad flavor to it.</li>
    <li> Works way better than those big name mouthwashes and very mild</li>
    <li> Honestly, it may kill bad breath but the problem I had with it and my son also is that for about 48 hours after using it your sense of taste is significantly altered. That was our experience, I couldn&#x27;t enjoy a glass of water because it tasted awful and my morning coffee was impossible to drink. I ended up pouring both bottles down the sink.</li>
    <li> Sorry I just do not get this stuff. Bought it rather than the brand I usually do because they are listed as the #1 product for Mouthwash here on amazon with over 1,400 amazing reviews, and figured it must be pretty dang special stuff. I have gone through one bottle of it and I just do see it being any better than any other mouthwash I have ever used, and would say it is not near as good as most other ones. Highly unlikely I will ever open up the second bottle of it.</li>
    <li> This is a tough review to write.  The taste itself isn&#x27;t great but the results are as promised.  I expected this to be minty, and it isn&#x27;t.  It has a flavor that I cannot quite describe, but after using it, the mint flavor is there.  Overall, I recommend it because seems to do good for breath.  This might be one of those products you really need to try for yourself, but if you want the fresh breath it describes it is probably worth a try!</li>
    <li> So far seems to be working. My boyfriend tends to have really bad breath so I was desperate to find something that would work more long term then mouthwash. There&#x27;s not much of a minty smell which is like but at least his breath isn&#x27;t so rank lately.</li>
    <li> I use it right after it arrived it worked right away. I asked several people to smell my breath because I was so happy with no burning or strong after taste .Hours later I was still happy the next morning I was feeling happy ever after. Thank you Dr. Harold Katz!!!!</li>
    <li> This is have used for years along with the toothpaste. This is awesome for bad breath problems. It is the best. And I was so pleased to find I could order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This does not perform as advertised</li>
    <li> A little bland, I prefer mouthwash with alcohol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly 10 years. If you have struggled with bad breath, this product will change your life. Go to their website and read their instructions on how to use this product. You may notice a strange taste at first--this is a side-effect of getting rid of the bacteria that&#x27;s been tainting your mouth. They recommend dipping your tooth brush in baking soda to help combat this. I do notice from time to time (like maybe once or twice a year) that I get a flare-up of bad breath, sometimes it lasts a day or more. Adding back the baking soda helps, as does chewing their gum. I won&#x27;t ever go back to using regular toothpaste, period.</li>
    <li> I had (what felt like) permanently bad breath. No matter how long I brushed my teeth my breath would eventually smell after a few hours. With this mouthwash, my mouth is fresh for the whole day, even when I eat and drink. It&#x27;s truly magic in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS AND SO FAR IT&#x27;S WORKING FOR ME AND I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO PEOPLE I KNOW.</li>
    <li> Works but after some time it stops working...you gotta alternate brands</li>
    <li> Wow... The best in the market !! Hands down !!!!</li>
    <li> This oral rinse is simply amazing. My boyfriend had some not so great breath (to put it lightly) and I finally got up the courage to tell him, which wasn&#x27;t fun, but we decided to see what was out there to help. We found this on Amazon and what can I say? It&#x27;s completely solved his bad breath issue - for good. And not like other mouthwashes where he would rinse, his breath would be overly minty and alcohol tasting for 10 minutes, and then the bad breath would mix with the minty mouthwash smell and create an even worse bad breath. He uses it 2-3 times a day and it keeps his breath smelling like, well, nothing. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. It smells like normal breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it myself a few times and it has a very interesting taste. There is a faint mint taste, but mostly it tastes like water and peroxide. I&#x27;m not sure how much he uses or for how long he uses it, but I believe he told me that he uses half of a cap full to rinse his mouth and half of a cap full to gargle with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you though, it really works. I can now kiss my boyfriend and hold conversations with him lying or sitting very near him without needing to &#x27;come up for air&#x27; (I promise I am not shallow, but bad breath really puts a damper on things!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Used this product one day( twice morning and night). Had barely any morning breath the next day. And absolutely nothing for the next two days. Love this</li>
    <li> Sometimes you buy things and finally get them only to have your bubble bursted. It either doesnt look like you thought it would or doesnt work like you thought it would. This product does EXACTLY what it says it will! I am so thankful for that! Who would have thought! I had never even heard of this stuff before... But I tell you one thing..I will never be without it again. :D</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s natural, has a nice light minty flavor and keeps your mouth fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> I give this products five stars because it works in my mouth even when I don&#x27;t use it! I use it about 5 times a week and I can see a HUGE difference!</li>
    <li> the mouthwash does a great job in keeping my breath fresh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using TheraBreath oral rinse for years and love the way it makes my mouth feel.  I like both the green and blue (Mint and Icy Mint).  If you try to eat right after then food may taste funny but other than that I&#x27;ve never noticed it affecting the taste of food.</li>
    <li> The absolute best best best mouthwash there ever was.  Light, fresh, WORKS.  It doesn&#x27;t burn - it doesn&#x27;t have to in order to work.  I am obsessed to say the least.</li>
    <li> One of the best products on earth.</li>
    <li> I thought my husband&#x27;s bad breath was just something we would have to live with.  A few days of this product  eliminated all signs of halitosis.  When he has been without it a few weeks, we all start to notice.  Thanks for making a great product.</li>
    <li> Taste is nothing to write home about.  Have used half of my first bottle.  Need to use both bottles before I fully rate product.</li>
    <li> Had someone with the courage to tell me about my breath. I began using Dr. Katz products and use this rinse with the toothpaste and wetting lozenges. Immediate results 3 or so years ago and still using to this day. Spendy, but worth it and cheaper to buy on Amazon than in any drug store even with the coupons you will find inside the packaging.</li>
    <li> What else can I say? It is absolutely the best in the market.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it runs out too fast( one bottle in a week) because my husband &amp; I are using it everyday(twice a day),</li>
    <li> The combination of using the mouthwash and toothpaste for about 3 months cured my tonsil stones. I am so glad the ENT doctor recommended TheraBreath! I have been using both for 18 months now and they have not come back!!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash has given me back my confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I&#x27;ve struggled with the awkwardness and social anxiety which comes with having bad breath.I have tried many mouthwashes and NONE have been able to help cure my poor breath, until now. This product is nothing short of magnificent. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Life changing! This has been the ONLY thing that helps rid bad breath. I am no longer self conscience when speaking close to others. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this - stop and just buy it already! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle at WalMart. Am a pipe smoker and hoping to eliminate bad taste in mouth in morning. Hidious afterttaste, wife swears my breath is worse. Yucky taste, unable to taste food for an hour after rinsing. Save your money. It is an advertising con job!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST ever mouthwash to remove odors.  I had done a lot of research on the net and discovered this product.  It sells for much more at Walgreens, but bought one to try it out.  I have never regretted since and neither will you.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t burn and leaves my mouth feeling very fresh.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a year, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I had huge results. Then I stopped using it (ran out). Since I wasn&#x27;t totally impressed, I switched. Now I see the difference. My mouth is so dry now that I&#x27;m constantly sipping water. I will definitely switch back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using therabreath  (toothpaste and rinse) for over 5 years. I love the taste and how clean my teeth feel. I don&#x27;t have time to go for cleanings as often as I should, but every time I go, my hygienist comments on how little work she has to do. Before using therabreath I used to get cavities all the time even though I was good about brushing my teeth. By the time I was 25, I literally had a filling in every tooth. I haven&#x27;t had a new cavity since I started therabreath, plus my gums got really healthy and never bleed even when I brush very hard (I used to see some blood every now and then). Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and daughters use this product and it has made a big change with their bad breath issues.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> works great thank you very much i will be buying it again very soon my wife did notice the difference</li>
    <li> Yes, the word that comes to mind is \\&quot;vile.\\&quot;  When I first took a sip, I thought, \\&quot;What the **** is this?  Saliva?\\&quot;  I&#x27;ll never use this product again.  For those who do like it, however, you should know that I got it for less than $8 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Have had bad breath, mostly due to throat...(see comment on chlorofresh). I brush and floss daily but realized problem must lie in throat. I saw this and thought, I can&#x27;t hurt. The taste is surprisingly mild. I take half a capful and gargle for 30 sec or so deep in back of throat and swish around my mouth. I don&#x27;t know if it helps ... i imagine it does...but I&#x27;m very confident when I&#x27;ve used it. I will continue to use it and take the chlorofresh nightly because it makes me feel that I&#x27;m doing everything I can to have fresh breath. Worth a try, absolutely!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Doesn&#x27;t have hardly any taste. Sometimes you might find it on sale at Walgreens or CVS Pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care how much this costs. It&#x27;s worth every penny to avoid using the mainstream mouthwashes - with alcohol and without - which both have serious side affects after prolonged use. I&#x27;ll be buying their other products as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this combined with the Dr Katz tooth paste. It works well and my mouth feels healthier and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint in these does take a bit to get used to because it is pure mint extract rather than the fake, chemical mint found in most mouth wash products. Now I prefer this minty freshness over the fake mint.</li>
    <li> Not a harsh mouthwash but leaves you with fresh breath.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my Husband he likes the taste and most importantly it truly helps his breath especially when used in conjunction with the toothpaste. No more Dragon lol</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had been ragging on me for having stinky breath at all times.  I was in despair!  Then I found this stuff.  It cleans the nasty germs out of the throat that build up day after day, especially in your sleep, and which I now believe caused the dragon breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I highly recommend this stuff.  It cured my bad breath and it&#x27;ll work on yours.</li>
    <li> This works great. I&#x27;ve purchased this because I hated listerine and the burning it gave when ever I used it. With therabreath I was able to get my mouth clean and when you gargle it in your throat you will notice a much bigger difference in fresh breath. I feel more confident with myself and the flavor is something that isn&#x27;t overpowering like the rest.</li>
    <li> My husband has battled bad breath for years.  This is the only product he has found to work well.  And it&#x27;s cheaper than the other stuff people recommend.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> So i waited a while before writing a post, but I have to say I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always struggled with breath issues, but was able to control it with obsessive levels of oral hygiene, which included brushing multiple times a day, always carrying mints and gum. God forbid I was caught without gum or mints, I would be really self conscious. Most recently things got worse. Gum and mints made my breath worse, Listerine made my breath worse. I would brush my teeth and floss and it was like I had done nothing. My morning breath was also really bad. My hubby who is the kind of person that never gets bad breath told me I smelled like I was rotting from the inside. I started to get depressed and self conscious, so I started researching. I spoke to a friend who is a nutritional scientist and did a major overhaul. I took digestive enzymes, and intestinal probiotics she suggested to help be produce more saliva and digest my food better. That helped a little, and provided comfort after eating, but I still wasn&#x27;t feeling as fresh as I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found Dr. Katz&#x27;s stuff. I did the oral probiotics starter pack and the mouthwash. At first I thought the stuff was just okay, but I stuck with it. A couple of weeks in, it&#x27;s like a miracle. My morning breath is gone, and my breath is neutral...it smells like nothing, which is what I always wanted! I don&#x27;t gargle as much as prescribed, I use enough to coat my mouth. I do like combining it with the toothpaste that was provided in the probiotic starter pack, but it was small. I found Arm and Hammer has a very similar toothpaste for much cheaper. My routine is to brush with A&amp;H Hydrogem Peroxide and Baking Soda paste, and rinse out the paste with this mouthwash. I am just so happy that I don&#x27;t have to be so self conscious anymore. The probiotics say you may have to use them again, but I will wait and see. I also have some oral probiotic tablets from NOW that hold me over and taste like Strawberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced no aftertaste, in fact it is nearly tasteless. I prefer this as it does not burn like Listerine. I say give it a try, and give it several weeks before making a verdict. It took me a couple of weeks for my mouth to neutralize. I have to say my breath smells/tastes so good right now that I almost feel like i don&#x27;t need it, but I don&#x27;t want to take the risk. Definitely give it a try if you are like I was and at a loss with traditional oral care products.berry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced no aftertaste, in fact it is nearly tasteless.

    <li> it is great mouth wash and fresh breath is always welcome.  highly recommend. ~!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used.  Thera Breath lasts 12 hours or more.  It helps with dry mouth but is extremely effective for bad breath.  You may have a bad taste in your mouth but there is no accompanying odor.  I am grateful I found this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Like gargling with warm, bland water. A complete waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Doesnt dry your mouth.  Works very well</li>
    <li> Keep my kids mouth fresh. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I tried this oral rinse for the first time today and it is excellent. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am on blood pressure medication which makes my breath stink (according to my teenager daughter who has no issue telling me so).  I searched for a cure, and came across this product on Amazon.  I like it so much I&#x27;m on subscribe and save with it.  It really helps so much.  I did buy the toothpaste that goes with it and I don&#x27;t like that, but this mouthwash is great.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, you mouth just feels way cleaner and bad breath is gone.</li>
    <li> made a difference after the first use</li>
    <li> Makes your breath smell well!  Have in on a subscription basis now.  2 bottles every 2 months no more morning breath.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from BB for the past 15 yrs !!! At one point I was in a depression because of it,,,, had no social or family ,,, I didn&#x27;t even have to talk to small my breath , I just had to open my mouth to pollute the room!!! Tired so many remedies but it didn&#x27;t work ... I finally came across this life changing product ,,, this actually F**** WORKS !!! I can finally make out without killing my husbands nostrils ... This is so worth your money ,,, it taste great not like bleach like some other products ..</li>
    <li> I have a 16 year old son who is autistic and has had the worst breath of any one I have ever known.  We initially though it was because of his limited diet choices when he was younger, but as he aged, so did his appetite, tremendously. Then we thought maybe its his dental hygiene care. We also had to dismiss that as well as his bi-annual checkup&#x27;s are perfect. Unfortunately, being a teenager he is becoming very hyper-sensitive about this.  It wasn&#x27;t until I accidentally found this product while searching for toothpastes and just happened to see the extremely high ratings, which made me inquire into what the product was and also decided to try it. When I received it and was reading more about it helping with dry mouth, which I suffer from, I decided to try it too.  I discovered nearly immediately with my son that his breath had ZERO odor. It was like it was just natural. It was the most amazing thing. It also helped my dry mouth but not quite as quick.  I  am now 100% sold on these products and I plan to extend the line we will use.  Nothing is bad tasting either, which is the perfect way to get a 16 year old autistic kid to try things!  Thank you Dr. Katz! You&#x27;ve really changed the fate for a high school kid who already is being pick on for having a disability.  Adding chronic bad breath on top, basically just put a bulls eye on his forehead for more things for kids to be mean to him for. You have helped my son take some of that power back! I read your bio about your daughter so I&#x27;m assuming you understand. Thank you again!  Buy this product people, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> great product i  could recomend. keeps your mouth fresh for many hours. just follow the instrcutions. came brand new a properly packed. two huge bottles. i would definitly keep buying. thanks seller</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I use mouth tabbacco products. Ive certainly cut back and what I&#x27;m left with is white teeth and unfreshend breath. Give this product a try. I work out of town so the convenience is phenominal to just order.</li>
    <li> Like previous reviewers have mentioned,  this mouthwash makes everything you put in your mouth, including your own saliva, taste like its been soaked in detergent and gasoline. Unless youre a little twisted and this appeals to you or youre on an extreme journey to weight loss, I would try a different product!</li>
    <li> I feel that this has really helped my bad breath and dry mouth. I have a lot of mouth problems recently and this is more soothing than listerine. It is a little expensive though and a bottle doesn&#x27;t even last a month if used as directed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and from the start it works and completely neutralizes bad breath instantly. I was looking for something to use to freshen horrible breath from Atkins diet and it is great combating that dilemma. However, the toothpaste and mouthwash are not to be rinsed out with water afterwards and for me that posed some problems. It made my mouth dry and white on the outside so to alleviate that I rinsed the outside of my mouth with warm water and put on a moisturizing lip balm. Also, gargling with the mouthwash made for a terrible sore throat so I stopped gargling and just rinsed out the inside of my mouth with the mouthwash. To reach the back of my throat I use the therabreath sinus drops and those do not create any problems with a sore throat. Hope this helps someone with those issues....</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I don&#x27;t believe there is another mouth wash on the market that does what this product delivers, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all. Thanks Dr.</li>
    <li> TheraBreath is the best mouth wash on the market!Tastes good and contains no alcohol. It keeps your mouth healthy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will like it.</li>
    <li> I use this product morning, afternoon and evening. I carry some in my purse, just in case. It works (according to others I&#x27;ve asked), and I have confidence in it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I like to smoke cigars and this is the only thing that gets the morning after taste out of my mouth. It really does work.</li>
    <li> This became my must-have product since 2012. It really works wonders. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> smells pretty good!use it now a lot!</li>
    <li> Got this for my teenage boys and it keeps their breathe in check. Love this!!</li>
    <li> As many other reviewers said this gives you sore throat. Didn&#x27;t help much with the dry mouth issue!! Will not buy again!!</li>
    <li> Works just as it claims :)</li>
    <li> Therabreath is simply the best mouthwash I have ever used.  It does not have sugar or sweeteners so my mouth just feels clean.  I have always worried about my breath.  Within a few days of using this product, I realized that my mouth tasted and smelled different.  I use the toothpaste too.  Yes, it is pretty expensive, but it is now a necessity for me.  I will use this mouthwash and the toothpaste forever.</li>
    <li> When used correctly, this stuff works.  Doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like other mouthwashes.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is amazing! It is gentle and never stings like Listerine, yet it is more effective for controlling breath odors. If you suffer from acid reflux or any condition that might affect the taste in your mouth and cause a lingering odor, this product will fix it! My breath smells great in the hours after I use this. It is expensive so I switch on and off with Listerine which is cheaper, but overall I love this product!</li>
    <li> Works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> TheraBreath is the best system for taking care of bad breath.  It&#x27;s very important that you only use TheraBreath products together and not mix them with other products.  Doing so will drastically diminish its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Mint flavor is very mild.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it really helps rinse my mouth. It makes my mouth feel refreshed and clean. It has good ingredients and the price is perfect for me. The quality of this product is really awesome. I would highly recommend this product to customers!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product, the taste is fresh, and it also removed my bad mouth smooth, I will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> What can I say.  This does the job.  I reorder all the time.</li>
    <li> Makes a noticeable difference.  I will buying this again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have as much luck as other people with this stuff.  I still need a way to remove the tonsil stones that aren&#x27;t exposed.</li>
    <li> The product itself is helping somehow but it is still very expensive. The maker should review his prices...</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me. I prefer breath rx over this, but try it since everyone is different and it might work for you.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic mouthwash.  It has no alcohol so it does not dry out your mouth like the other commercial mouthwashes do.  In the past I have suffered from tonsil stones, I use this oral rinse to gargle because it helps neutralize any odors.  The feeling of freshness lasts and I am not self-conscious to speak to people closely.  I would recommend getting it through Amazon because in my experience it is more expensive to purchase it at a place like cvs, etc.  It&#x27;s a bit pricier but so worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff.  He swears by it.  He said nothing else works like this product.  We have this shipped on a routine basis.  Automatic shipment so he never runs out.  Very mild Oral Rinse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this product from the website I visit a lot. People told this item works great. First, I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this cuz, I never saw this brand on local mart, tv, or magazine. However, as my hubby getting hard time with his bad breath, I decided to have him try this. And my hubby loves this. He ask me to subscribe this item at amazon so he doesn&#x27;t need to wait for when he used up this mouth wash. Later, I found this item at local stores, but they were more expensive than amazon&#x27;s price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend people have bad breath. Totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+) looks like it doesn&#x27;t cure/heal bad breath. just help instantly. means you need to keep using this</li>
    <li> After reading some of the Real reviews about this product I decided to give it a try even thou there’s a lot of scam artist on here and I don&#x27;t believe half of u lol but in life u must take chances so anyway No more bad breath :) :) :) :)THIS IS THE BEST MOUTH WASH I EVER USED in 39yrs. If your having problems with bad breath  *this is your answer*&lt;br /&gt;Love&lt;br /&gt; satisfied</li>
    <li> Recommend by my Dentist and it is a great product.  Wife loves it also.&lt;br /&gt;Side:  Amazon delivered in one day but quoted 7 days.  Amazon is great.</li>
    <li> To me this is far superior to traditional oral rinses. Use the tooth paste first and follow up with this. Your bad breath worries are over.</li>
    <li> Wife and I both use this product. Can&#x27;t really tell you that it works differently/better than any other mouthwash, but we both think highly of it.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I like it a lot better than Smart Mouth.</li>
    <li> Good product at a decent price</li>
    <li> this is good to prevent bad breath but doesnt do anything immediately, buy for bad breath not just to clean your mouth</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash and use it every single day!</li>
    <li> My whole family uses it.  I have young kids who don&#x27;t brush perfectly so this is great to make sure that their breath smells clean!  It is not harsh or &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; so the kids tolerate it well.  I got this originally for my husband for his bad breath and since he has been using it, I don&#x27;t notice that he has bad breath so it IS a good thing!  This seriously works well!!  Mild tasting yet very effective!</li>
    <li> The TheraBreath mouthwash (oral rinse) works ok. It does leave you somewhat refreshed after using but I do not feel it is worth the price at all. For those who are on a budget,  this mouthwash might be too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a fair length of time and have not noticed much change with my gum issues, but they are no worse since starting to use this product either. It is a shame that so many products that are advertised as beneficial to health-  are priced so high and  out of the range most consumers can spend on a regular basis. The manufacturer is asking too much money in my opinion- if they were that concerned about their buyers health- they would price it affordable.</li>
    <li> Mild tasting, but WOW!! You won&#x27;t wake up with morning breath! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This really does keep my breath fresh even when I wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I think it works! My husband&#x27;s tonsil rocks and bad breath have gotten way better from using this. I can tell when he hasn&#x27;t used it for a couple days. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> gum tastes great &amp; along with the xylitol toothpaste &amp; rinse, I had my first PERFECT checkup.  Dentist said keep doing what you&#x27;re doing.  Gave to my daughter &amp; it is a mild enough flavor for her as well.</li>
    <li> super toxic by my perception. I flushed it down the toilet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I used to mix my own hydrogen peroxide and sea salt to gargle/rinse. This is easier and leave my throat/mouth mucous free and so clean feeling. Like fresh from the dentist.</li>
    <li> This fresh breath mouth washing product leaves your breath feeling as though you&#x27;ve just brushed uour teeth.</li>
    <li> Ya, I really like it, I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so mild and makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
    <li> I have suffered bad breath for a long time.  I tried mints, mouth washes, etc.  Nothing worked.  I knew I could have bad breath from time to time, but when my daughter said to me &amp;#34;It always stinks&amp;#34; that is when I started looking. I bought my first bottle from a local drug store. After using it one day my daughter was said &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t stink anymore&amp;#34;.  She checked my breath periodically during the day, each time saying it didn&#x27;t stink. I just follow the instructions on the bottle and wash &amp; gargle in the morning and at night. So far it seems like my bad breath is a thing of the past.  Will start buying from Amazon to save on cost.</li>
    <li> Did not fix my breath and changed my taste, I did try what it said to do if it changed my taste but did not work.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I will only buy from amazon because it is so expensive!&lt;br /&gt;Delivered quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> While this mouthwash seems to do a decent job, people I&#x27;ve asked tell me that it doesn&#x27;t smell any better than simply brushing my teeth.  The taste is nothing to brag about and the price is high.  I quit buying it on subscription and just trust my toothpaste to do the job.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash, with a clean and fresh flavor.</li>
    <li> I SWEAR THIS RINSE REALLY WORKS! ONLY CON IS YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO USE IT. I STOPPED FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND THE DOOKIE BALLS (TONSIL STONES) RETURNED! YUCK THEY ARE SO DISGUSTING AND THEY MAKE YOU VERY INSECURE WITH YOUR BREATH. IM HAPPY WISH I COULD LOAD UP FOR ABOUT A YEAR SUPPLY FOR A DISCOUNT. THE 2 BOTTLES SHOULD LAST ABOUT 3 MONTHS.</li>
    <li> There is a person in my life that... needs this.  I can not describe &#x27;their&#x27; breath, and in being kind I will leave that part out.  I also noticed that &#x27;they&#x27; have breathed through &#x27;their&#x27; mouth most of &#x27;their&#x27; life. The last 15 years, at least.  After using this product correctly the first time... well, I wanted to cry for happiness!  15 years, and finally!  And yes, &#x27;they&#x27; tried many mouthwashes before. Follow the directions!!!  If you do not, it will not work properly.  Just follow the directions!  How hard is that?!  It absolutely kills DEATH BREATH. And it&#x27;s sold at Walmart as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swish a capfull through each tooth in your mouth, across your tongue and gargle with it for a minute and a half.  Then, use another half capfull again for a complete minute.  It&#x27;s amazing.  It won&#x27;t burn, has no mint taste.  I find that if &#x27;this person&#x27; swishes for MANY MINUTES (4 to 5), gargling and all, it can work without a second capfull!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people love you, people outside your home family, they may not want to tell you about your breath.  They don&#x27;t want to hurt your feelings. Watch to see if people step back when you are talking to them. Or if they put their hand over their mouth or nose. Or ask them outright, if you care about other people.... or don&#x27;t want them talking behind your back!  This product is easy to use.  Why wouldn&#x27;t you?  Even if you don&#x27;t want to ask, or are unsure about yourself, just use it!  It&#x27;s worth every single penny.  As a matter of fact, I find it completely reasonable in price.  The bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it now. (after I use my enamel mouth rinse on my teeth alone.) As I KNOW it works for someone who has always had the worst of all possible bad breath. I feel confident to work with the public when I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much, from my entire heart, thank you TheraBreath!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good but expensive. Works well even through garlic, onion and junk food breath.</li>
    <li> Wish it had more of a fresher taste (but without using bad infredients to get it)</li>
    <li> I have tried this product and at first loved it because i would wake up with no bad breath at all. The problem is that this product did leave my mouth with an unpleasant after taste. Aditionally, I did start having very dry lips which gave me serious allergies on my lips!! After discontinuing use, everything went back to normal.</li>
    <li> It really works!!  I have been using it for two weeks and it worked the second day I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i found this 10 years ago. I have been trying many products but non worked.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend said she loves me all again.&lt;br /&gt;This is a life saver.</li>
    <li> been using this for months after reading how this may be the best mouthwash for tonsil stones and morning breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;boy was i wrong. this mouthwash seems to work fine the first half of my work day (9-noon). however, right before lunch and immediately following, the morning breath returns with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all i am left with is a hole in my pocket from this expensive goofy looking mouthwash</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash ever...hands down.  It has a slight pepperminty flavor that does not leave an aftertaste.  More importantly, this product just kills anything that causes bad breath, period.  Onions too!</li>
    <li> I bought TheraBreath whim when I was looking for a more natural mouth rinse.  I have always suffered from morning breath, but when I use this rinse I have none.  I use it twice a day, morning and night.  If I don&#x27;t use it before bed, my breath doesn&#x27;t smell horrible at night but it does taste bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is not to drink water for five minutes after using, that is noted on the bottle and seems to lower the efficacy.  Also, it says \\&quot;fill up to the line\\&quot; but there are several lines on the little measure cup they give you and I use the lowest one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has worked great for me and I am super happy.</li>
    <li> Very mild taste that I like it, dont makes me feel uncomfortable, and clean smell. I tried oral wash from other brands that you can buy in supermaker, I hate those, it was too strong, and made me to shed tear.</li>
    <li> I like how this does not burn and leave a strong taste in your mouth after you rinse with it.  It does get rid of bad breath even morning breath! I am impressed!</li>
    <li> I tried this rinse for cleaning up my cigar breath. I was using so much mouthwash that was alcohol based, that the inside of my mouth always felt raw and burnt. When used in conjunction with Katz&#x27;s toothpaste, I attain clean enough breath to where my wife is pleased. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I tried other products , when I have allergy and sinus, so taking antihistamine makes dry mouth, , this is the best</li>
    <li> This has changed my life. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and wow.... I have had  hard tartar build up  on my two bottom front teeth luckily you couldn&#x27;t see it unless you were up close on a mirror, but I was still very Self conscience about it and it didn&#x27;t help my breath. I haven&#x27;t gone to the dentist in almost 12 years,&lt;br /&gt;( no Insurance) but my teeth have been white and cavity free so the hard build up was my only issue and the bad breath caused by it. Well today I pulled out my teeth cleaning tools that never worked before and it scraped right off the only change was this mouth wash. I recommend it highly and would give it 10 stars if I could. I suffered from bad breath for 2 years along with the build up and both are gone. No mints, gum, toothpaste, cleaning kit, or mouthwash have worked until this product. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Really helps in combatting bad breath! Helps loosen tonsil stones!</li>
    <li> Dried out my mouth :/  I&#x27;m sensitive so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gave this to my dad.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan and love this product. really a great deal...</li>
    <li> This will really help a  problem I&#x27;ve had for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and was thrilled the first two days and nights I used it because you do wake up with fresher breath.  HOWEVER, I noticed my coffee at the office tasted awful the first morning.  I didn&#x27;t even think it had to do with the mouthwash.  I use a little sugar and this tasted like someone put a Sweet &amp; Low in my coffee.&lt;br /&gt;I confirmed it was the mouthwash when I tasted my coffee at home and it had the same awful taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also made other food and drink taste different but for me COFFEE was effected the most.  I wanted to love this product because it was mild tasting and was very good at keeping my breath fresh but I can&#x27;t have my coffee taste ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this 5 days ago and it has a lingering effect on your taste buds that hasn&#x27;t completely gone away yet.  I look forward to having my sense of taste back.  Hopefully that is very soon.  NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Great taste without the alcohol burn-leaves your mouth feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> First, this product does what it promises: it does not sting or burn, and it does leave the mouth feeling clean and fresh.  I expect it is a godsend for those with severe halitosis.  I like that it&#x27;s American made, not tested on animals and comes packaged like an old-fashioned private label product your town pharmacist would make up in the back of the store.  The price is fair and it gives good value.  It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I deactivated my subscription is that using this product temporarily leaves a strong metallic taste in my mouth that interferes with enjoyment of everything I eat or drink, even plain water.  It&#x27;s like a combination of baking soda, peppermint and stainless steel that won&#x27;t go away.  It works okay used in the evening for slightly less than the recommended one minute, then rinsed a minute later with plain water, when I&#x27;m not going to eat for about 9-10 hours. I made the mistake of trying it twice in one day and decided it would make a great weight loss aid - made food taste terrible.  It took two days for this lingering after-taste to disappear.  So it all depends on your priorities - odorless breath or the pleasures of good eating.</li>
    <li> Mouth feels great. Wish I had this product through my pregnancy because of the heartburn that made my mouth feel dry and not fresh most of the time.  I nurse and was still feeling like my mouth was dry until I started using this rinse.  Mild taste that is refreshing. Does not burn. Long lasting freshness in mouth.</li>
    <li> I ordered this stuff randomly one night when I was in an Amazon craze.  I realize I chew a lot of gum and to be honest I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because my breath is unpleasant (no one has ever said anything, don&#x27;t really know why I think this) or what but I do.  So I read the reviews, and obviously like any product on Amazon it&#x27;s got it&#x27;s share of good and bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is I ordered this stuff and it really works.  The flavor is a very very mild mint flavor.  It almost has no flavor at all, it&#x27;s more of a hint. What I do is brush my teeth, and before rinsing out the remaining toothpaste I pour a cap full of TheraBreath and swig it around in my mouth for about 60 seconds.  After that I spit it out and pour another cup, this one I gargle for about 30 seconds. I go to sleep afterwards, wake up and I honestly have no morning breath. It&#x27;s not like its covered up, it&#x27;s actually gone.  There is no morning breath, and your mouth doesn&#x27;t have a strange morningy taste in it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other mouth wash other than Dr. Katz TheraBreath Oral Rinse. I have been using it for years and I love it. Doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel dry like other mouth washes.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with tonsil stones, I would get them repeatedly by the week. As a last resort I tried this mouth wash out, and let me tell you, it works wonders. I haven&#x27;t seen a tonsil stone in months since I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash regularly.</li>
    <li> I have used every mouthwash on the planet. I decided to try this one. It works! It has given me a great boost to my self-esteem.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot,I used it for many years now and I&#x27;m happy with it,and I will buy it allways at amazon of course</li>
    <li> Not sure... Who tells me I have bad breath?  I am not in the habit of asking.  I hope it is working.</li>
    <li> This is hands down, the best mouthwash I have ever used.  The claims made about keeping your mouth and breath fresh are really true!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and it works. I could write a whole lot more on this but why should I? :) ok ok. a little bit more.... I recommended this oral rinse to a BUNCH of friends and everyone bought at least one to try and they all loved it too. I can write a review on here that I&#x27;m confident it would make you want to try it if you haven&#x27;t already but I wont. I don&#x27;t get paid for it! I should though :) I can go out there and sell this product like &amp;#34;water&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Good tast,mild mint so cool</li>
    <li> My two biggest problems have been my halitosis and my unven skin tone on my face. TheraBreath almost instantly cleared up my breath issues, 5 stars! I have been using Skingenixx Face Cleanser [[ASIN:B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]] over the last few weeks, and my skin has improved drastically. Thank you for these amazing products!</li>
