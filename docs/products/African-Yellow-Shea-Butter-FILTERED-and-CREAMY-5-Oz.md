      <li>very nice and effective skin moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It is a great texture and goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>Emu oil was supposed to be great, but I found that Emu oil gave me more acne.  </li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this product!</li>
      <li>so you can add your own ingredients.  </li>

      <li>This stuff is interesting.  </li>
      <li>When it runs out just melt some more &amp; pour it in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had good success with my existing routine.</li>
      <li>sincerely hope Amazon reads these reviews and starts making more efforts at better quality control for these kinds of products.</li>
      <li>This stuff us so much better than any lotion out there.</li>
      <li>i guess its okay.</li>
      <li>The smell is fantastic if you are like me &amp; love the sort of cocoa butter smell to it.</li>
      <li>Shea butter has also been great on my natural hair as well.</li>
      <li>I am easily overpowered by smells, and this one does not do anything to me at all.</li>
      <li>Your lip liner will glide on smooth &amp; not tug.</li>
      <li>which is really important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The price is fantastic which is why it got 1 star from me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>w your hands to spread, and apply a light bronzer (make up).   </li>
      <li>Add a few wee drops of lavendar and you have a wonderful soothing, calming relaxant...</li>
      <li>It makes my skin so smooth</li>
      <li>So, when I found this, I was excited to use it.</li>
      <li>This is some rich luxurious butter here.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had shea butters before but this is SUPER rich yummy butter.</li>
      <li>Shea butter is not supposed to be bright yellow</li>
      <li>This is way to bright and yellow as though color has been addded to it.</li>
      <li>If it is pure white, or odorless, it has likely been adultured to be more appealing to the nose, since shea butter doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant scent ever.</li>
      <li>A lovely soft yellow color, very nice texture, (</li>
      <li>Other than that, its still great for hair and skin</li>
      <li>It is pure, great quality and lasts a rather long time, considering the size.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m confused how this got so many great reviews</li>
      <li>This has made a huuuuuuuuge improvement in my skin, and once its fully absorbed, I sometimes wait 30min, and blot my skin with a papertowel (bc I am so oily).</li>
      <li>I have personally with my own hands picked Karite Fruit from a shea tree and ground it into butter.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Also... my dogs get chapped paws &amp; the shea butter healed their tootsies right up.</li>
      <li>This stuff has more of the texture of coco butter with yellow food coloring.</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth and should melt directly if rubbed in your fingertips.</li>
      <li>What you see in the picture is exactly what you&#x27;re going to get.</li>
      <li>As a knitter,my hands need to be smooth or the yarn doesn&#x27;t slide easily.</li>
      <li>This product came quickly, but it was not raw.  </li>
      <li>im guessing that&#x27;s just the way shea butter smells in its pure form</li>
      <li>I highly recommend NATURE and HERBS not only for the superior product but also for the outstanding customer service, which  now a days is few and far between.</li>
      <li>If you really want to get creative you can buy the empty large twist up stick applicators online</li>
      <li>This Shea Butter really and noticably improves the way your skin looks and feels.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for taking the time to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is much easier to use.</li>
      <li>very moisturizing and comes in</li>
      <li>i really dont know</li>
      <li>and they compared it with their real shea butter.</li>
      <li>I usuallyjust take chunks of it and press it into the palm of my hand to soften it, and recently I learned you can make your own whipped body butter with it simply by mixing it with an electric mixer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good way to apply it without mess &amp; waste.</li>
      <li>(but kpanghnan butter is!), and instead should be a light yellowish grey or beige color instead.</li>
      <li>(looks like a giant lip balm) &amp; melt some shea butter in the microwave then pour it in the applicator &amp; put it in the refrigerator to cool.</li>
      <li>If you melt it and mix it with your favorite essential oil, the natural, slightly burnt aroma can be easily masked.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for dry heels and will last for a long time.</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell</li>
      <li>This shea butter is helping to smooth out those rough places that happen every winter.</li>
      <li>The smell is not the greatest, but it&#x27;s a very faint, natural smell-- nutty, but not something you&#x27;d eat.</li>
      <li>Originally I bought raw shea butter from a street vendor, ladies, waste no more money on high end product, this is natural, very inexpensive and is EXCELLENT - I am naturally olive toned however years in the sun produced age spots and as I began to tone my weight my face was sagging, I didn&#x27;t really notice at first the good it was doing, everyone else did, I have no laugh lines, no sun frowny marks, spots are lighter and less noticable</li>
      <li>But it is NOT RAW shea butter.</li>
      <li>&amp;lt;UPDATED REVIEW&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few more days after posting my original review, I am updating it because I am now fully convinced that yellow coloring has been added to this as well as other ingredients.</li>
      <li>in your microwave /on low/ till a soft liquid mass</li>
      <li>but I never go tthis far.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed a diminish in my old acne scars, no products have ever helped.  </li>
      <li>but definitely you can tell this stuff is the real deal.</li>
      <li>That can easily go in the purse with you all winter to rub on elbows and other dry winter chapped spots as well as rubbed on your hands.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cool to not have to cover up my acne everyday with products and makeup.  </li>
      <li>I have tried at least 100 products for my face...expensive stuff from Sephora, cheap stuff from Walmart, years and years of trying products..</li>
      <li>After going through all of this, it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin nearly as well as the L&#x27;Occitane Organic Shea Butter, mixed with Aquafor.  </li>
      <li>Straight out of the container, shea butter is not very \\&quot;spreadable\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It can be a little hard to warm</li>
      <li>I actually went to an african market near me and showed it to them</li>
      <li>Shea butter should feel thick, but smooth, and not gritty at all.</li>
      <li>it is at first and seem a little grainy till it melts in your hands, but I got used to it</li>
      <li>From my experience purchasing raw organic shea butter, I can say with confidence that what is being sold on here is not real shea butter, but more than likely a similar butter from the African Yellow Butter Tree called \\&quot;Kpangnan\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Other butters I&#x27;ve had are much lighter yellow or almost white.</li>
      <li>I compared the texture to those little tubs of Carmex, hard packed and used by rubbing your finger across it) very, very light fragrance.</li>

<li> I have been using this product for 2 months straight, and have discontinued the use of my acne cream (except when its needed in a small area of my skin) and discontinued the acne lotion.  </li>
<li> This quantity will last a long time.</li>

    <li> very moisturizing and comes in it&#x27;s unrefined state so you can add your own ingredients.  the only thing i was taken aback by was the smell which was unpleasant, but im guessing that&#x27;s just the way shea butter smells in its pure form</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter really and noticably improves the way your skin looks and feels.  Great on hands, face, any part of the body really.  Arrived at my door in only a couple days.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Slather this all over. This stuff us so much better than any lotion out there. Great for dry heels and will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had shea butters before but this is SUPER rich yummy butter. The smell is fantastic if you are like me &amp; love the sort of cocoa butter smell to it. It&#x27;s very light odor but definitely you can tell this stuff is the real deal. Other butters I&#x27;ve had are much lighter yellow or almost white. This is some rich luxurious butter here. Excellent for softening heels, elbows, and generally moisturizing skin.  Perfect for use as a lip moisturizer by itself or in a lip balm recipe. I use a tiny bit of it as a lip prep before applying lip liner &amp; lipstick. Your lip liner will glide on smooth &amp; not tug. It will get rid of those unsightly lip wrinkles &amp; lines too. I make my own lip balm &amp; everyone raves about how emollient it is because of the shea butter I add to the recipe. If you really want to get creative you can buy the empty large twist up stick applicators online (looks like a giant lip balm) &amp; melt some shea butter in the microwave then pour it in the applicator &amp; put it in the refrigerator to cool. That can easily go in the purse with you all winter to rub on elbows and other dry winter chapped spots as well as rubbed on your hands. Nothing cures the winter chap like shea butter. Unfortunately it will melt in hot summer weather if you put it in your bag but I still use it indoors during summer too. When it runs out just melt some more &amp; pour it in. It&#x27;s a very good way to apply it without mess &amp; waste. Also... my dogs get chapped paws &amp; the shea butter healed their tootsies right up. This stuff must have a million uses.</li>
    <li> I have an autoimmune disorder that makes the skin on my palms very , dry, and they peel and sometimes bleed.  I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Occitane Organic Shea, mixed with Aquafor, after perscription ointments and creams didn&#x27;t help.  I&#x27;ve had good success with my existing routine. But the L&#x27;Occitane is $39 a can, which is quite pricey, for me.  So, when I found this, I was excited to use it. Especially after reading the description.  The price is fantastic which is why it got 1 star from me.&lt;br /&gt;As for my issues: 1) It stained my gloves, and I got a tiny piece on my nightgown which is stained too.  2) The smell is hideous.  It reminds me of terrible baby vomit. 3) After going through all of this, it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin nearly as well as the L&#x27;Occitane Organic Shea Butter, mixed with Aquafor.  I did mix this product with my Aquafor as well.&lt;br /&gt;I should say too ,this product is very hard. So you&#x27;ll need a makeup or other little spatula to use it.</li>
    <li> Originally I bought raw shea butter from a street vendor, ladies, waste no more money on high end product, this is natural, very inexpensive and is EXCELLENT - I am naturally olive toned however years in the sun produced age spots and as I began to tone my weight my face was sagging, I didn&#x27;t really notice at first the good it was doing, everyone else did, I have no laugh lines, no sun frowny marks, spots are lighter and less noticable and I use this on virtually everything.  It takes very little to cover your face and hands.  Add a few wee drops of lavendar and you have a wonderful soothing, calming relaxant... No Kidding..!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I could not get to my local store for raw shea butter.  This product came quickly, but it was not raw.  it appears as if they melted raw shea butter and poured it into a container.  Raw shea butter is lumpy.  When you rub it, it gets creamy and spreads evenly.  This product is flaky and falls into pieces.  Dont get me wrong, it is real shea butter.  But it is NOT RAW shea butter.</li>
    <li> in your microwave /on low/ till a soft liquid mass and this is much easier to use. very nice and effective skin moisturizer. just heat 10-15 seconds and will have much more &#x27;us&lt;br /&gt;able&#x27; form.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter is the perfect cold-weather moisturizer! The Shea Butter was delivered in a very timely matter and the product is superior! Why buy moisturizer that has a small amount of Shea for 3x the price when you can get the real deal through this company at such a nominal fee. I highly recommend NATURE and HERBS not only for the superior product but also for the outstanding customer service, which  now a days is few and far between. &lt;br /&gt;Be careful though because a little dab will do ya! If you suffer from excema or dry and cracked skin this will cure it. I have suffered from all 3 all my life and have finally found an affordable remmedy. This stuff works!</li>
    <li> Having read the negative reviews, I was a little fearful of what freezing temps would do to my shipment of African Shea Butter Cream. Instead, my tub of shea butter is perfect! It looks like a tub of butter, melted, poured into a tub and cooled. A lovely soft yellow color, very nice texture, ( I compared the texture to those little tubs of Carmex, hard packed and used by rubbing your finger across it) very, very light fragrance. As a knitter,my hands need to be smooth or the yarn doesn&#x27;t slide easily. This shea butter is helping to smooth out those rough places that happen every winter. I am so pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> What you see in the picture is exactly what you&#x27;re going to get. It&#x27;s excellent quality shea butter. The smell is not the greatest, but it&#x27;s a very faint, natural smell-- nutty, but not something you&#x27;d eat. I am easily overpowered by smells, and this one does not do anything to me at all. The moisturizing properties are fantastic, especially now during the cold weather. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get a bigger tub, and will have to re-order soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused how this got so many great reviews-this stuff stinks like rubber and you cannot mask the smell!  I was making homemade body butter to give away as gifts but they won&#x27;t want this!  I added over 40 drops of Lavender oil and you could not even smell the lavender even a little!  This a complete rip off and Amazon and Halal Everyday should be ashamed of themselves for lying to people!</li>
    <li> whats this for you might ask..... your geuss is as good as mine. its something my wife wanted me to order for her. i guess its okay. i really dont know and i didnt care enough to ask her what she thought of it.</li>
    <li> I have tried at least 100 products for my face...expensive stuff from Sephora, cheap stuff from Walmart, years and years of trying products..I have had severly oily skin with acne since I was 13....I saw this product and thought i&#x27;d try it, since i&#x27;ve tried everything else..  I used to use an acne face wash, acne cream, and an acne lotion...I have been using this product for 2 months straight, and have discontinued the use of my acne cream (except when its needed in a small area of my skin) and discontinued the acne lotion.  Now, I just wash my face, rub this stuff in-takes a little warming up w your hands to spread, and apply a light bronzer (make up).   This has made a huuuuuuuuge improvement in my skin, and once its fully absorbed, I sometimes wait 30min, and blot my skin with a papertowel (bc I am so oily). I have noticed a diminish in my old acne scars, no products have ever helped.  my skin looks brighter and refreshed. It&#x27;s so cool to not have to cover up my acne everyday with products and makeup.  Emu oil was supposed to be great, but I found that Emu oil gave me more acne.  I hope that this helps, and brings hope to people with the same problems as me.</li>
    <li> When used in combination with black soap, you will see your skin go from dull to radiant. I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell so I add a few drops of scented oil to my hands before applying. Shea butter has also been great on my natural hair as well.</li>
    <li> I was born and raised in Ghana. I have personally with my own hands picked Karite Fruit from a shea tree and ground it into butter. I have never seen Shea butter in a yellowish gold color until I came into the United States. Shea butter is usually an off white, beige color. The texture is smooth and should melt directly if rubbed in your fingertips. This stuff has more of the texture of coco butter with yellow food coloring. The best Shea Butter I have found since I cant get it shipped from home is on CoastalScents.com. Its the closest thing to what I remember from home.</li>
    <li> Used this for everything from hair conditioner, to lotion/lip balm, to bases for makeup mixtures.</li>
    <li> This stuff is interesting.  I used it for a while as a moisturizer, I know there are products that can be made from it but I never go tthis far.  As a moisturizer, it is very thick and stays on well.  This quantity will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product, with continuous use your skin will look beautiful. So try this great product.  I have used Shea Butter for about 10 years off and on, and Shea Butter never lets me down.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful customer of Amazon for a very long time, but after purchasing bad Argan oil from 2 companies on here, I became aware that they have a serious quality control issue when it comes to natural, decanted products from outside sellers. It has really made me upset seeing that fake products are sold on here and that Amazon doesn&#x27;t seem to care much about resolving this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so on to the product. From my experience purchasing raw organic shea butter, I can say with confidence that what is being sold on here is not real shea butter, but more than likely a similar butter from the African Yellow Butter Tree called \\&quot;Kpangnan\\&quot;. Shea butter is not supposed to be bright yellow (but kpanghnan butter is!), and instead should be a light yellowish grey or beige color instead. Shea butter should feel thick, but smooth, and not gritty at all. If it is pure white, or odorless, it has likely been adultured to be more appealing to the nose, since shea butter doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant scent ever. With that being said, shea butter does not smell awful. If you melt it and mix it with your favorite essential oil, the natural, slightly burnt aroma can be easily masked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product being sold on here is not \\&quot;bad\\&quot; per se. It does have highly moisturizing properties similar to shea or cocoa butter, but if I want to purchase raw organic shea butter, I want to be sold raw organic shea butter! It&#x27;s as simple as that. I usually purchase mine on another site for about $16 for 1 pound and that includes shipping. Yes it&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s authentic. And fair trade too! which is really important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely hope Amazon reads these reviews and starts making more efforts at better quality control for these kinds of products. I hate feeling like I&#x27;m being duped into buying lesser quality products! Thanks for taking the time to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Straight out of the container, shea butter is not very \\&quot;spreadable\\&quot;. I usuallyjust take chunks of it and press it into the palm of my hand to soften it, and recently I learned you can make your own whipped body butter with it simply by mixing it with an electric mixer. Both of these methods work great for making the product easier to apply.</li>
    <li> &amp;lt;UPDATED REVIEW&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few more days after posting my original review, I am updating it because I am now fully convinced that yellow coloring has been added to this as well as other ingredients. It actually leaves a yellow stain on my hands and clothes. This is NOT 100% shea butter. I actually went to an african market near me and showed it to them and they compared it with their real shea butter. It is nothing a like. Do not buy from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im a little suspicious of this product, it smells like shea butter and feels like it too, but  dont understand why it is so yellow. I have been to africa and seen raw shea butter and its usually greyish or off white. This is way to bright and yellow as though color has been addded to it. Other than that, its still great for hair and skin but I dont think I will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It makes my skin so smooth and I use it most days after dudu osun soap (you can fin it on amazon, it&#x27;s also wonderful!). I lie in Denver and it very dry here so I use it all over my body. It can be a little hard to warm it is at first and seem a little grainy till it melts in your hands, but I got used to it an will definitely order another jar of this stuff, especially at this price!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is pure, great quality and lasts a rather long time, considering the size. It is a great texture and goes on very smoothly. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize long term- in other words, every time I wash my hands I have to reapply. But I suppose that is normal and typical of all creams and butters.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I will be ordering it again!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the wording on the lid seems a bit home-made and amateur. It claims to help with skin conditions, such as eczema. I have some type of dermatitis on my finger but this cream didn&#x27;t help at all, and I apply it at least 5 times a day.</li>
