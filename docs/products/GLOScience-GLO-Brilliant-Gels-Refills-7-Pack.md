      <li>Very good product to gently whiten your smile Fast service.</li>
      <li>Bought the &amp;#34;Glo&amp;#34; light machine with this product ~</li>
      <li>Your smile will thank you!</li>
      <li>but he said because I have reseeding gum lines I would have to put a special ointment on my gums for about a month to tolerate the whitening process,</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t need to whiten my teeth because they looked good, but I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this because It did whiten my teeth a couple of shades even though I already had fairly white teeth.  </li>
      <li>These gels are really good for getting that glistening white smile that you want.</li>
      <li>my teeth it evenly and quickly...</li>
      <li>~ my teeth are bright, white and exactly how I wanted them to look when I paid my dentist $500.00.  </li>
      <li>The package is just as they describe and exactly like the one you get with the original kit.</li>
      <li>Noticeable difference after the first use!</li>
      <li>and I have re-ordered it for a second time now and even bought my husband a separate mouth piece and his own set of gels.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>They were yellowed right after I received them.</li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of teeth whitening products over the years and nothing had ever made much of a difference until I discovered Glo, for the first time in all my years of whitening people are actually commenting on how nice my smile and teeth look.</li>
      <li>It is such a fast and effective way to whiten teeth.  </li>
      <li>There is more than enough gel here for two people.</li>
      <li>I really like it !</li>
      <li>purchased the light/mouthpiece, and I started using it, and after 1 day of using this, you could really see a difference!</li>
      <li>The Glo system works extremely well, its high quality, and is very easy to apply, use, and clean.  </li>
      <li>This is a real rip off.</li>
      <li>We really like the gel.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought the entire glo science package mouthpiece and all.</li>
      <li>This is good whitening gel and not much sensitivity to my teeth which is the only one I have used thus far that way.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest you get the machine and this product</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these whitening vials, along with the mouthpiece.</li>
      <li>This product has worked as state by the manufacture, I have no negative comments or experiences with it.  </li>
      <li>My only issue is that you ABSOLUTELY have to use the lip balm or you can blister your lips!  </li>
      <li>but if you don&#x27;t and you are willing to spend the money then look no further.  </li>
      <li>just give my teeth that pearly white feeling, but don&#x27;t go over and use them really frequently because I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not healthy for your teeth.</li>
      <li>I have had professional whitening and have done these.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done that, and not only is it $$, they make my teeth very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;This has taken the place of that, and the over-the-counter whitening strips.</li>
      <li>Initially I used the whole package of 10 that came with the whitening system - 1 per day.  </li>
      <li>My gums have been a bit sensitive, though.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t really work, after all that money spent..</li>
      <li>The taste is pleasant and does not hurt you or make you sick if you swallow some while it is in your mouth whitening.</li>
      <li>Ít is good last time I get from the store it was bad .</li>

<li> My husband didn&#x27;t take my advice and he suffered something terrible with blisters for over 3 weeks after his 5 day whitening process was complete.  </li>
<li> Very expensive for what it does.  </li>
<li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> which is the percentage of peroxide?</li>
    <li> Price was right,delivery was good. Jury still is still out on effectiveness</li>
    <li> I think it is a awesome product.</li>
    <li> I use one gel per month and keep my teeth super bright.  It is an excellent buy and keeps me smiling</li>
    <li> Effective and no sensitivity issues what-so-ever with Glo whitening gels.  Packets are easy to use and apply.  Wish they would offer a family/bulk packaging option.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great system.  Initially I used the whole package of 10 that came with the whitening system - 1 per day.  Incredible results.  I have coffee daily so I use 1 gel per week after the initial 10 to keep my teeth looking white.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll use 2 per week for a boost.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of teeth whitening products over the years and nothing had ever made much of a difference until I discovered Glo, for the first time in all my years of whitening people are actually commenting on how nice my smile and teeth look.</li>
    <li> This is good whitening gel and not much sensitivity to my teeth which is the only one I have used thus far that way.</li>
    <li> My teeth are white and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;did my teeth it evenly and quickly...I got a double kit, my son also was impressed with his outcome!</li>
    <li> This product has worked as state by the manufacture, I have no negative comments or experiences with it.  The prices is very good, shipped right away and was delivered to my door by a special carrier which was impressive for $45.</li>
    <li> received item promptly and as promised thank you</li>
    <li> Ít is good last time I get from the store it was bad . The gel turn in like water</li>
    <li> I have used Glo Whitening for appx. 4 years and I absolutely love the effects.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference after the first use! My gums have been a bit sensitive, though. 1 vile was enough for 6 uses.</li>
    <li> Really works (at least for me) and doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity.  There is more than enough gel here for two people. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I did four days of treatment, and my teeth looked like I got my teeth whitened at the dentist. I&#x27;m doing my boyfriend&#x27;s and friend&#x27;s teeth now. We love this product. :-) :-D</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t &amp;#34;wine&amp;#34; about your stained teeth, get these! I have used these now a few times over the last couple years. The package is just as they describe and exactly like the one you get with the original kit. Use them to get rid of my red wine stains and the occasional cigar. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for what it does.  My daughter bought the unit, used it a couple times, so thought I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is a real rip off.</li>
    <li> I love my GLO teeth whitening system. I was 1st introduced to the GLO &amp;#34;Go&amp;#34; whitening vials, that do not use the mouthpiece, and after a few uses, I noticed that my teeth were noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the light/mouthpiece, and I started using it, and after 1 day of using this, you could really see a difference! My teeth were not majorly discolored to begin with. They just needed a little sprucing up (I drink coffee/tea), and I want to have the brightest smile I can get, without having to pay for expensive whitening trays from the dentist. I&#x27;ve done that, and not only is it $$, they make my teeth very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;This has taken the place of that, and the over-the-counter whitening strips. With the GLO system, I have no sensitivity whatsoever. I highly recommend these whitening vials, along with the mouthpiece. If you don&#x27;t want to get the mouthpiece for some reason, and still want to try GLO, I would get the GLO &amp;#34;Go&amp;#34; whitening vials. I still use those when I&#x27;m taking a break from these. Your smile will thank you!</li>
    <li> Tried going to the dentist for the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; bleaching ~ didn&#x27;t see much difference at all and was very disappointed.  Bleached at home for over two years with the dentist&#x27;s bleach and wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  Bought the &amp;#34;Glo&amp;#34; light machine with this product ~ what a difference ~ like night and day almost immediately!  I highly suggest you get the machine and this product ~ my teeth are bright, white and exactly how I wanted them to look when I paid my dentist $500.00.  He didn&#x27;t give me the results I wanted ~ this product with the accompanying Glo machine did for much less.</li>
    <li> This product works well for teeth whitening as advertised.  It made a noticeable difference.  Does not whiten bridgework or crowns.</li>
    <li> Not as white as I want</li>
    <li> I really like it ! Does a great job</li>
    <li> everything was as I expected and the product worked great and arrived in good shape, on time, and did the job I needed it to do</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really work, after all that money spent..</li>
    <li> I have had professional whitening and have done these.  Similar results but much less expensive.  Great for touch up.  About $200 for starter kit but inexpensive to maintain.</li>
    <li> If you are buying a refill them I&#x27;m sure you have the unit but if you don&#x27;t and you are willing to spend the money then look no further.  The Glo system works extremely well, its high quality, and is very easy to apply, use, and clean.  I have has 3 of my friends buy it after I told them how I get my teeth so white.</li>
    <li> If you want your teeth to be whitened, this is the way to do it. These have worked extremely well for me.</li>
    <li> These gels are really good for getting that glistening white smile that you want. I originally bought the entire glo science package mouthpiece and all. I was originally looking for a way to whiten my teeth without whitening strips because of all the bad things I heard about them and I found this. The&#x27;re like going to dentist to get your teeth whitened without actually going to the dentist and I reorder them every six months just give my teeth that pearly white feeling, but don&#x27;t go over and use them really frequently because I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not healthy for your teeth.</li>
    <li> i love my Glo the price was super!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think my teeth look whiter.  I have used the product 6 times and will continue until I have used it 10 times.  So far, not much difference.</li>
    <li> Very good product to gently whiten your smile Fast service.</li>
    <li> Was going to have the Dentist whiten my teeth but he said because I have reseeding gum lines I would have to put a special ointment on my gums for about a month to tolerate the whitening process, so I bought this and I have re-ordered it for a second time now and even bought my husband a separate mouth piece and his own set of gels.  We both LOVE LOVE this product.  Also my Dentist told me I really didn&#x27;t need to whiten my teeth because they looked good, but I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this because It did whiten my teeth a couple of shades even though I already had fairly white teeth.  My only issue is that you ABSOLUTELY have to use the lip balm or you can blister your lips!  My husband didn&#x27;t take my advice and he suffered something terrible with blisters for over 3 weeks after his 5 day whitening process was complete.  One of those; I TOLD YA SO&#x27;s!!!!!!  Great product!!</li>
    <li> had no expectations about this product.  my teeth do seem whiter / brighter in a very subtle way.  i&#x27;m half way through the treatment.  VERY easy to use!!!</li>
    <li> Love my Glo and the results it produces.  It is such a fast and effective way to whiten teeth.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> made my wife&#x27;s skin more plausible. really good for her</li>
    <li> We really like the gel.  It does a great job.  Sometimes, however, the packaging leaks so you could loose some of the product.  We wish they could improve the packaging.</li>
    <li> These gels with the GLO mouthpiece works fantastically.  You will not be disappointed. The taste is pleasant and does not hurt you or make you sick if you swallow some while it is in your mouth whitening.</li>
    <li> works well as advertised, just wish I used the product more</li>
    <li> They were yellowed right after I received them.</li>
