<li> only lasts for a few hours, and it does wash out easily.</li>
<li> I dyed my African American hair blonde, which turned into light brown in some areas, and other highlighted tones throughout my hair.  </li>
<li> Very watered down product.</li>
<li> his 7 year old head used about half a can.</li>
<li> I got this to spray on a chick to hide bare skin to keep other chickens from pecking one of the flock.  </li>
<li> The look was not a natural look but we needed something that would wash out every night after performances and this did the trick.</li>
<li> Due to my gray hairs around my hair line, those were even a lighter blonde.  </li>
<li> My child&#x27;s blonde hair was black for Halloween.</li>
<li> I think next time I would &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; with a hairspray and see if that kept the black intact.  </li>
<li> In other words, it doesn&#x27;t seem to ever dry.</li>
<li> I was careful not to touch my hair all day.</li>
<li> My sister used it after me and spent quite some time cleaning her ears out.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s dark and saturates to create a deep black temporary color.</li>
<li> I use this temporary hair spray to add a little color to my gray hair and thus making me look a few years younger.</li>
<li> I though I ordered brown instead of black</li>
<li> This product did turn my hair black.</li>
<li> Will transfer black everywhere.</li>
<li> my hands turned black.</li>
<li> My shirt also had black on it by the end if the night.</li>
<li> It was a little messy around the hair line but seemed to not be much trouble after setting for awhile.</li>
<li> Spraying it is a bit messy.  </li>
<li> It took a few times shampooing it</li>
<li> Extremely messy.</li>
<li> The sprayer on this product is not concentrated into a narrow spray.  </li>
<li> I will note that because it is in a spray can, it can get messy.</li>
<li> Can I tell you I was a jet black wearing sista that day!  </li>
<li> my hair was so sticky &amp; stiff after applying it, I had to rewash it.</li>
<li> It runs and makes hair unbearably stiff</li>
<li> Thus, I had to find something temporary and very black.  </li>
<li> The black has a greasy quality about it that makes it hard to rub off.  </li>
<li> Spray the product into the container and apply it with a small paint brush to the area.  </li>
<li> Not sure if they will cause it to come out.</li>
<li> --it&#x27;s messy!</li>
<li> It was so hard to get out of my hair.</li>
<li> Color comes off on your hands; awful and hard to get off.  </li>
<li> One thing that I do have a problem with is when I sweat really bad after a run</li>
<li> Not recommend it, if u use it you will have the color on your shirt, clothes soooo bad</li>
<li> my car seat headrest was filthy.  </li>

    <li> I used this to be Alice Cooper for Halloween. I have about medium length, not very thick hair and this covered it with some to spare. It was a little messy around the hair line but seemed to not be much trouble after setting for awhile. I was careful not to touch my hair all day. I also applied ALOT of aerosol hairspray to keep it from sloughing off. It took a few times shampooing it but it came out pretty easily and did not change my color at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent spray on hair color. Easy to use, color is great and washes out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend if you want some color without anything permanent.</li>
    <li> Not recommend it, if u use it you will have the color on your shirt, clothes soooo bad</li>
    <li> did the job sprayed last until my next wash, good be very careful in the rain though</li>
    <li> the review was bulls*** not you have to spray the entire bottle to work but do not buy</li>
    <li> I got this to spray on a chick to hide bare skin to keep other chickens from pecking one of the flock.  I saw this on youtube.  It didn&#x27;t work as well as I hope but I am going to try it again.</li>
    <li> Extremely messy. Gets everywhere. Can&#x27;t even touch your hair without getting this everywhere. DO NOT RECCOMEND</li>
    <li> Let me tell you how marvelous this product is...I dyed my African American hair blonde, which turned into light brown in some areas, and other highlighted tones throughout my hair.  Due to my gray hairs around my hair line, those were even a lighter blonde.  I didn&#x27;t want to wear my hair out on a particular day, so I threw one of my jet black ponytails on, and had the bright idea to use this spray.  Can I tell you I was a jet black wearing sista that day!  It covers my gray fabulously!  It&#x27;s better than anything else out there.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> My son has very blond hair so for Halloween he wanted to be Harry Potter.  Thus, I had to find something temporary and very black.  This product did well on coverage as he got black hair fairly quickly-- his 7 year old head used about half a can. However, after an hour or so, it began to come off his head onto anything he touched.  He face was dirtier than a chimney sweep&#x27;s and my car seat headrest was filthy.  The black has a greasy quality about it that makes it hard to rub off.  By the end of the night he was steel gray and so was anything around him.  We washed his hair a couple of times and it left a shadow on his scalp but mostly came off.  My car is a different story.  I think next time I would &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; with a hairspray and see if that kept the black intact.  Works in a pinch but be warned--it&#x27;s messy!</li>
    <li> Not quite sure what to say about this.  What I would suggest to anyone buying this, is to have a plastic container that you plan to use for this.  Spray the product into the container and apply it with a small paint brush to the area.  I used it on a beard.  Spraying it is a bit messy.  So I applied it with a clipper cleaning brush.  It does stay on and does not sweat out.  I wouldn&#x27;t constantly touch it however.  Not sure if they will cause it to come out.</li>
    <li> Spray- on application, very easy to use for light touch up very quickly, thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Worked great. Used entire can on medium length mens hair.</li>
    <li> Very watered down product. Will not be buying again thats for sure. Arrived quickly but that is all the good I can say.</li>
    <li> This product causes my scalp to itch even if  I apply oil before or after use. High Beams works very well.</li>
    <li> I use this temporary hair spray to add a little color to my gray hair and thus making me look a few years younger. It washes out very easily with shampoo and therefore must be applied after each hair washing. For those that don&#x27;t want to permanently dye their hair, it&#x27;s a good temporary solution.</li>
    <li> It runs and makes hair unbearably stiff</li>
    <li> I came across this product in am hair magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It totally covers your gray areas and it doesn&#x27;t come out until you was it out..</li>
    <li> I love the product because it covers well. One thing that I do have a problem with is when I sweat really bad after a run sometimes it begins to drip but I catch the drip and the rest of the product continues to cover the gray.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly, but is much smaller than i thought it would be. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I though I ordered brown instead of black</li>
    <li> This product did turn my hair black. It was so hard to get out of my hair. If I touched my hair to move it out of my face my hands turned black. My shirt also had black on it by the end if the night.</li>
    <li> my hair was so sticky &amp; stiff after applying it, I had to rewash it.</li>
    <li> This product would be great for a Halloween costume and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> My child&#x27;s blonde hair was black for Halloween. It looked pretty good.  It only took a couple washings to get it out of his never chemically treated hair.</li>
    <li> At first I was hesitant to buy this product for fear that it wouldn&#x27;t work, but I was pleasantly surprised! It offers amazing coverage!</li>
    <li> I love the product, but the price was way too high from these people. I bought it because I was completely out, but will try to look else where, where I know I will find it cheaper.</li>
    <li> The sprayer on this product is not concentrated into a narrow spray.  It sprays as though you are spraying Pam on a frying pan.  It remains sticky on your hair and easily rubs off on your pillow.  In other words, it doesn&#x27;t seem to ever dry.</li>
    <li> Color comes off on your hands; awful and hard to get off.  Cheap product.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Item stains everything, clothes, pillows, skin, fingers. Forehead always was blk no matter how many times I cleaned</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the new high beam I have been using the older spray for years don&#x27;t like the new and improved spray 👎👎👎👎wish y&#x27;all still sold the older one</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.my edges are grayling so it does the job without me having to keep coloring.very convient and fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this to color an actors hair. The look was exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s dark and saturates to create a deep black temporary color. The added benefit of the hairspray meant we could style and color the actor&#x27;s hair in one step. The look was not a natural look but we needed something that would wash out every night after performances and this did the trick.</li>
    <li> Great product, I was Phantom of Opera and this did the black hair trick&lt;br /&gt;REMOVED VERY VERY Easily with 2 back to back shampoo&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;GET IT FOR the best effect.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse</li>
    <li> Good product, washes out good, but don&#x27;t use your nails to scratch your scalp.</li>
    <li> Covered my hair without a problem, and came out with two washes. I will note that because it is in a spray can, it can get messy. If you don&#x27;t want it on your ears, they should be covered before spraying. My sister used it after me and spent quite some time cleaning her ears out.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good.. just be careful how you spray.. only lasts for a few hours, and it does wash out easily. Not recommended for beards though..</li>
    <li> Has great coverage, completely turned my blonde doughter&#x27;s hair black. Definitely put on hair after styling, can&#x27;t brush or move after. Washed out sooo easily! Very happy with the product. This product is perfect for a one time use. You can not sleep or rub your head on anything while it is on. Will transfer black everywhere.</li>
