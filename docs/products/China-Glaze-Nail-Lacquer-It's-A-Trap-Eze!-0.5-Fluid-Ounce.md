      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unique and that&#x27;s something I love about China Glaze.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would even like it, but it&#x27;s so much fun!</li>
      <li>I however notice that it chips easily and the glitters get caught in my hair when washing it in the shower causing them to flake off.  </li>
      <li>Love the color and it shipped quickly and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>The glitter is beautiful and lays flat on the nail.</li>
      <li>It takes a few coats but it is still super cute. :D</li>
      <li>The only con to this nail polish is that it does chip easily even with a good top coat.</li>
      <li>Very pretty!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hailing from their Cirque du Soleil collection, it&#x27;s by and far the most popular polish from said collection.</li>
      <li>Very streaky by itself so layered it over white and it was awesome!</li>
      <li>It will look perfect for new years with all of the different colored glitter specks.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for myself as a christmas gift and it was love at first sight right out of the package!</li>
      <li>Ehh its nothing special.</li>
      <li>The idea of this polish is really cool, although it almost looks like there&#x27;s elmers glue in it with glitter which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore it and I can&#x27;t say I have anything like it in my collection :)</li>
      <li>almost to clear to put on own</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite from the China Glaze Cirque collection.  </li>
      <li>Over other colors too it looks great.</li>
      <li>and it arrived at my house fairly quick.</li>
      <li>This polish was highly anticipated by me as I have a huge nail polish collection and the swatches of this were to die for!</li>
      <li>very pretty.</li>
      <li>It works best if you dab the first coat and then add other coats as normal.</li>

      <li>This is definitely my new favorite nail polish.</li>
      <li>BUT, this product was as described and super fun.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a unique glitter coming from mainstream brand, and the colors of glitter are really pretty.</li>
      <li>overall its nice for women that like girlie styles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Tip: if you find it to be too sheer on its own after two coats, layer it over a white or teal polish to help achieve opacity more quickly.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a special, fun polish to add to your collection for year-round wear, then I highly recommend It&#x27;s a Trap-eze!</li>
      <li>I took off the nail polish I was wearing right away</li>
      <li>and i like the item and buy other item to same saller very good</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The polish is so beautiful on, about 3 coats for opacity, and a couple layers of topcoat to smooth the glitter out. Removal is awful though but its worth it.</li>
    <li> I really love this color. It is a little thicker than I would like it to be. Totally worth the small pain of application.</li>
    <li> This is a great polish. Only takes two coats to become opaque. I did three coats to get some extra glitter, and two coats of top coat. So far I don&#x27;t have any chips. It is also very unique and appealing to the eye - I catch myself staring at it throughout the work day. It kind of looks like if a Funfetti cake and a clown had a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love the color and it shipped quickly and was packaged well. No complaints here at all. It&#x27;s a beautiful nail polish too</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist, so i can get nail polish wholesale from my beauty supply, but i missed out when this was released with the Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away Collection! So i hop on amazon and the heavens opened and sent this to me! Not really, but the seller did send it in a timely fashion, but there was a swatch of it on the bottle which was a little odd. Anyway, I absolutely love this color and jelly formula. I&#x27;ve had it on my toes for three weeks and it has finally started to chip (I&#x27;m not a huge China Glaze fan due to their dry and matte formulas that chip almost instantaneously.) I&#x27;m amazed! MY TOES LOOK LIKE FUNFETTI CAKE &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love this polish. It is a good brand, the price was appropriate, and it goes with everything. Apply 2 coats and gets good wear. The Multics color sparkles match anything, and the white underglaze makes the sparkles more subtle. Great for any age! One of my favorite polishes, and the sparkles are easy to remove with polish remover too.</li>
    <li> I love cg its nice in the bottle but this color looks awful its also not an easy nail application either. Sorry cg not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I received It&#x27;s a Trap-eze as a gift. It is a milky white based multi glitter. It doesn&#x27;t really apply like a normal polish and takes a little manipulation to get your nail all covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we all know, glitters can be a pain to remove. I recommend using elmer&#x27;s glue as your base coat. Just apply it to the nail, let it dry, then a few coats of this color. Then peel it off when you are ready to change your polish.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for myself as a christmas gift and it was love at first sight right out of the package! I took off the nail polish I was wearing right away and, well, I still have it on my nails two days later! It&#x27;s so pretty! The nail polish itself is a white jelly base with purple, yellow, orange, green, blue and silver shiny glitter in a larger hexes and smaller circles. I absolutely adore it and I can&#x27;t say I have anything like it in my collection :)</li>
    <li> I am in love with this nail color now. I recieved the item with another item and was pleased with both. Overall satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love most of China Glaze&#x27;s polish, but this one was a bit of a disappointment. For starters, I thought the color was really pretty. It&#x27;s unique and that&#x27;s something I love about China Glaze. It was also good quality and didn&#x27;t chip for a while, even without a top coat. My problem, however, is that it&#x27;s really difficult to get off. I had to scrub my nails very hard with nail polish remover and it still took much longer than it should have. I probably won&#x27;t use this particular polish again because it really annoyed me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this polish! I love the glitter and it works great with China Glaze, &amp;#34;Sun-Kissed&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;For Audrey&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Flip Flop Fantasy.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s great. The only downside, like all glitter, it&#x27;s difficult to remove with nail polish remover. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I loved this nail polish! It&#x27;s consistent and and looks beautiful! The glitter colors are lovely. Very happy with it. :)</li>
    <li> I love this. It is different and I have never seen anything quite like it. It reminds me of the funfetti icing.</li>
    <li> Everyone kept saying that it was the best but you won&#x27;t realize until you buy it how awesome it is!</li>
    <li> I have quite a collection of nail polish but this is by far the one I&#x27;ve been the most excited about receiving in a long time. It doesn&#x27;t dissapoint. Definitely try this one out its gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new favorite nail polish. The glitter is beautiful and lays flat on the nail. One coat is nearly enough and two coats is perfect. It&#x27;s just unbelievably beautiful. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this, think no more. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> very pretty. base is like a cloudy grey/white with all different colors and sizes of glitter pieces. almost to clear to put on own but I usually put a white or grey base coat.</li>
    <li> China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.</li>
    <li> I can never find a polish like that anywhere but finally I found it I found the best glitter polish ever u can use it by it self or on top of a white polish as a base but the best polish ever</li>
    <li> It looks like glue with crappy glitter flakes.... it is NOT pretty.... I like china glaze but they failed with this one...my own opinion..</li>
    <li> Whimsical and light-hearted, will just make you smile when you wear it!  Great China Glaze formula, semi-opaque milky base with  rose and turquoise glitters suspended in it.</li>
    <li> Ehh its nothing special. Its a bit chunky and looks kind of blah on the nails. I could do without having it.</li>
    <li> Given I&#x27;ve only tried three colors from this collection (this, whirled away, and get carried away i think) this one applies the best. One coat is pretty sheer, but once you get three coats on it&#x27;s wonderful. It looks like poptarts. Unlike most glitters, it&#x27;s not too difficult to remove either and dries quick. Such a fun color by China Glaze.</li>
    <li> I am not one that leans towards girlie. I like reds, and dark polishes; and I tend to wear a lot of black clothing wise. But I decided to try something different with this polish. The background comes out very stricky so I had to put a white polish first as the base so the color would look solid. It looks very nice and the glitter payoff is great... But it is very difficult to take off, more so than the average glittery polish. overall its nice for women that like girlie styles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great nail polish. It&#x27;s full of a multiple sized glitters in a white milky base. It gives a great coat and covers completely in 2 coats</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this polish.professional looking nails are minutes away.trust me guys your girlfriend or wife will love this one.</li>
    <li> Comes out a milky-white background with sparkles on top! I&#x27;m wearing it now and it is very beautiful yet unique!</li>
    <li> Beautyland sent me a used bottle of nailpolish with hair on it in addition to having polish on the outside of the bottle. I do not recommend buying ANYTHING from this seller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different. If you are searching for a polish that is a little different from the norm then this is for you. 4 stars because the milky white takes away from the brightness of the glitter.</li>
    <li> It took longer then expected to get here, But that was because of the Holidays I am sure, But this is my new favorite polish now. I LOVE IT!! My husband said it looks like the sprinkles on top of cookies.</li>
    <li> This color is a sheer white with multicolor glitter in it, giving the look of a &amp;#34;jelly sandwich&amp;#34; without going through the trouble.  I however notice that it chips easily and the glitters get caught in my hair when washing it in the shower causing them to flake off.  It is a pretty color and I&#x27;d wear this every day if I could, but it doesn&#x27;t last and gets caught on things.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of  the formula. It is goopy and soooo hard to get it off. It is kind of cool looking but I am not a huge fan. Sad too because I was so excited about getting this one.</li>
    <li> Very pretty! It stays on for a long time without chipping and Iv received some compliments too! It will look perfect for new years with all of the different colored glitter specks. Its beautiful! If you like glitter this is for you!</li>
    <li> I think I got it the day after I placed the order! Awesome job retailers! This was also on my wishlist since people have been raving about it, so i love it!</li>
    <li> It takes a few coats but it is still super cute. :D Love it. Over other colors too it looks great.</li>
    <li> I first saw this color on a beauty blog and had to have it! I was glad it wasn&#x27;t too expensive and it arrived at my house fairly quick. The color is a milky lavender with multicolor confetti pieces, it kinds me of funfetti cake! The only con to this nail polish is that it does chip easily even with a good top coat. If you&#x27;re at nail junkie like I am then you should get it!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift. It makes for a nice mani! It works best if you dab the first coat and then add other coats as normal.</li>
    <li> This polish is so glittery and doesn&#x27;t need a base coat (as it comes with a white base in it already)&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for upcoming NYE!!party /Night.</li>
    <li> Love this polish and wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to get it! Took about 3 coats to get full opacity but that was to be expected w/ a glitter polish like this. All of coloured glitter work very well together.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected but it wasn&#x27;t a bunch of clumped glitter with a watery background. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a unique glitter coming from mainstream brand, and the colors of glitter are really pretty. Only downside is that application can be tricky. The base seems thin and can drag, and sometimes the glitters get chunky on the brush. But overall it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
    <li> This is a very unique ( to me) polish and I really like it. It&#x27;s opaque in 2 coats. My only gripe is that CG polishes chip really fast on me. :(</li>
    <li> This has to be the ugliest nail polish I have ever seen. I thought it had a silver background but it is an ugly grey. I</li>
    <li> The idea of this polish is really cool, although it almost looks like there&#x27;s elmers glue in it with glitter which is why I gave it 4 stars. I thought it would be more of a white polish with glitter in it but you pretty much need to put some kind of base coat color on for the glitter to be prominent. BUT, this product was as described and super fun. My local beauty supply store carried the Cirque De Sole line and this was one of the ones that was sold out and couldn&#x27;t keep in stock. It was great for the price also. But I would say if you like the look of a lot of glitter, you need at least 3-4 coats.</li>
    <li> This polish was highly anticipated by me as I have a huge nail polish collection and the swatches of this were to die for! I was diappointed with this product, it took forever to dry (never had that problem with CG polish before) and was chunky. Ill stick to indie polishes for glitters!</li>
    <li> Very streaky by itself so layered it over white and it was awesome! I got many compliments when sporting this on my nails.</li>
    <li> Received as planned. Good product.</li>
    <li> This review is for Beauty Shine, NOT It&#x27;s A Trap-Eze! I love the nail polish. I ordered it as a gift for a friend. I received the wrong nail polish first (Whirled Away) and after providing the picture evidence the company asked for I was assured I would receive the correct product. What I received instead was an empty envelope with another copy of my invoice. Upon informing Beauty Shine of this issue, I was again asked for photographic evidence (I had thrown the empty envelope away. Why keep it?) and asked if the envelope looked tampered with. I have given up on receiving a refund or the correct product and have ordered (and received it) from elsewhere.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a polish fanatic like I am, you will both appreciate and love this new China Glaze shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hailing from their Cirque du Soleil collection, it&#x27;s by and far the most popular polish from said collection. It&#x27;s a Trap-eze! is a multi-colored, multi-sized glitter polish in a milky base, making it incredibly unique. I like to call it a &amp;#34;party in a bottle&amp;#34;. But whatever you call it, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have suggested it looks like the frosting on pop tarts, while others have suggested it looks like icing with sprinkles in it. If you&#x27;re looking for a special, fun polish to add to your collection for year-round wear, then I highly recommend It&#x27;s a Trap-eze! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you find it to be too sheer on its own after two coats, layer it over a white or teal polish to help achieve opacity more quickly.</li>
    <li> the new item and very fast shipment and i like the item and buy other item to same saller very good</li>
    <li> I love this polish. This color is so pretty, it really catches your eye.  I received so many compliments wearing this.</li>
    <li> Shipping was extremely fast but when I got the nail polish it has spilled or something and the lid was stuck shut from the dried paint so I dont know if I can get it open or use it!</li>
    <li> I love this polish. I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would even like it, but it&#x27;s so much fun! I always get compliments on it when I wear it! Now I want to get more similar ones in different colours! As always, China Glaze applied wonderfully.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite from the China Glaze Cirque collection.  This glitter has a milky base which becomes opaque after 2 coats, use three for high glitter coverage.  I love this polish.</li>
    <li> This has good staying power. My manicure lasted a week without chipping, but I had to put in five coats to get it to really pop. I use the China Glaze base coat and top coat, so that may have helped it last as long as it did.</li>
