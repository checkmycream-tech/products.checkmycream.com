      <li>I love this line.  </li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>Love the way this product leaves my hair feeling.</li>
      <li>Hair looks shiny and healthy now</li>
      <li>so it requires more moisture.  </li>
      <li>I love the way my hair feels after using these.  </li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
      <li>I am also sure that the one that claimed it to give greasy hair used a lot as well.   </li>
      <li>Love it, need it.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent as well.</li>
      <li>I love the L&#x27;Oreal hair products.</li>
      <li>I love it....</li>
      <li>and it is more unruly than my colored hair.  </li>
      <li>EverSleek Sulfate-Free Smoothing System Smoothing Deep Conditioner does a wonderful job of conditioning my hair.  </li>
      <li>The normal conditioner is great to use between washes when you dont want to use shampoo too often.</li>
      <li>The entire L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate-Free line is excellent for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>This product is the best  sulfate and silicone free deep conditioner for my 3c hair.</li>
      <li>How happy am I that Amazon has it and is a bit cheaper especially with auto ship which I have signed up for as I honestly cannot be without this product.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery!</li>
      <li>Afyer rinsing, my hair felt great and not very dry as my ends are fried from bleach.</li>
      <li>Great, smoothing conditioner that deep conditions.</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this in the mail and after using it could not believe how smooth my hair was.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do so much for frizz, but my hair seemed thicker, softer, and more healthy.  </li>
      <li>Talk about getting something worth your buck!  </li>
      <li>However since my hair is medium-thick in some areas I had to use more and now I&#x27;m out on the first time using it.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find this product special at all.</li>
      <li>I picked up a full size at Ulta and have been hooked.  </li>
      <li>Good Product, wish it came in a larger container.</li>
      <li>Double good.</li>
      <li>so silky soft and keeps it nice all day too,</li>
      <li>The texture and feel of my hair just keeps getting better, and it seems to be getting easier to get a good straight style with the flat iron.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is really nice and it works really well to damage and keep up hair, but it doesn&#x27;t have the creamy feel and nice smell of the other L&#x27;Oreal product that comes in a purple jar.</li>
      <li>Really does smooth hair and does not require a lot of product.</li>
      <li>Worth the $ and effort.</li>
      <li>Low cost, effective.</li>
      <li>The whole Loreal haircare line is actually quite good.  </li>
      <li>Nice moisture especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Still, I must say that so far the product seems to be working OK.</li>
      <li>Right now I am spending a lot of my time straightening my hair, but this stuff helps me out against frizz even when I don&#x27;t feel like using the straightening iron.</li>
      <li>I straightened the next day and it didnt go as straight as normal, but still looked good.</li>
      <li>Also, it has a pretty good value for me--I bought it a couple few months ago, and am not even halfway done with it.  </li>
      <li>but I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I have used it twoce thusfar and have about enough for 1 more application.  </li>
      <li>(remember that in order to remove most of silicons from your hair you need a shampoo with sulfate which is the fisrt enemy of the BKT), i use the shampoo from keratin research which is the keratin treatment i got (bought here on amazon which i totally recommend)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m much happier!</li>
      <li>If they make a big one I&#x27;ll probably go buy it because this really helps getting back to feeling and looking great.</li>
      <li>but this conditiiner makes my hair so soft and smooth</li>
      <li>This conditioner is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I think this wins as a fantastic deep moisturizing conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Quickly detangles hair and makes it feel soft.</li>
      <li>This might not be the case for people with longer or more dry hair, however.</li>
      <li>This product works well for the price however it does have a rather strong scent which I personally do not care for.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really tell much difference in results.</li>
      <li>This product really conditions my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair condition didnt really seem to change.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like smell much either...</li>
      <li>People need to stop using so much product on their hair.</li>
      <li>I expect to stay with this conditioner, and this whole line for a while.</li>
      <li>It really is sleek and the frizz seems to go away.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t make much difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many hair products and spent a lot on salon lines, and this is hands down the best product for thick frizzy hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Visibly reduced the frizz in my hair! I got the Eversleek set of Repairative shampoo+ Intense smoothing conditioner to use along with this product so it is possible the effect was a combination of the three.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve never deep-conditioned my (considerably frizzy) hair before so its possible that other deep-conditioners will work just as fine.&lt;br /&gt;Summary- my hair is much less crazy on those humid days and I&#x27;m much happier!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Eversleek Smoothing Deep Conditioner,\\&quot; can, I find, work nicely as part of my hair care routines. The manufacturer recommends its use once a week, to be left on for five minutes, and states that this product is free of harsh sulfates and heavy silicones, but contains Argan, sunflower and olive oils in an intensive, rich formula that weightlessly smoothes and nourishes the hair, helping to control frizz and improve manageability.  Furthermore, they state that, unlike some silicones that can coat hair, the natural oils in the contents will penetrate the hair fiber, while its natural botanicals are invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I use this product only approximately once a month, to deep condition my hair after it has been colored, and I leave it on for an hour if I can. And it does seem to work. I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair with a tendency to frizziness. And my hair does remain sleek, shiny and frizz-free for up to 48 hours, perhaps less than that when we get into the real summer heat and humidity around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I note that the ingredients do, however, contain various alcohols, and a whole lot of mind-bending artificial ingredients that I&#x27;d be more comfortable without.  Still, I must say that so far the product seems to be working OK.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair really oily after i blow dry it. feels like i can&#x27;t wash it all out.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a review in Cosmo magazine.  I used it at night, dried my hair, went to bed, straightened it in the morning, and my hair looked so shiny and healthy even with all that heat.  It also made my hair smell so good.</li>
    <li> Talk about getting something worth your buck!  I think this wins as a fantastic deep moisturizing conditioner.  I just got around using it for my wash week and let me say my hair feels amazingly soft and replenished like it&#x27;s marketed.  It has great slip and detangling is a dream. And the frizz?  What frizz?  None!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However since my hair is medium-thick in some areas I had to use more and now I&#x27;m out on the first time using it.  If they make a big one I&#x27;ll probably go buy it because this really helps getting back to feeling and looking great.</li>
    <li> I called L&#x27;Oreal to find if they sold the conditioner packaged in their Excellence hair coloring.  They said they did not, but recommended this as an alternative.  It was quite expensive but I was willing to give it a try.  Bought two jars to give it enough time and used it every time I washed my hair.  Did not get anywhere the same results.  Suggest L&#x27;Oreal market what they sell in their hair coloring separately!</li>
    <li> Did nothing much for my hair, except leaving a weird feeling to my hair. I didn&#x27;t like smell much either...</li>
    <li> This works, you put it on and then you can feel it instantly once you wash it off, I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> People need to stop using so much product on their hair. How did one reviewer consume all of the product in one use? I am also sure that the one that claimed it to give greasy hair used a lot as well.   This eversleek line worked best for me during the summer. I only bought the conditioner and this deep conditioner. The normal conditioner is great to use between washes when you dont want to use shampoo too often. The shampoo I used was Redken all soft. I have never tried a shampoo that could beat it.  Now that winter is here im back to using redken shampoo + conditioner. Sometimes I use the eversleek conditioner between washes.  I am a guy and I approve of this product.</li>
    <li> I love this line.  It really does keep my hair frizz-free for a long time.  I like how it is sulfate-free.  The whole Loreal haircare line is actually quite good.  Right now I am spending a lot of my time straightening my hair, but this stuff helps me out against frizz even when I don&#x27;t feel like using the straightening iron.</li>
    <li> smells great, have not used yet, but I&#x27;m sure it is as great as the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make much difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair gets very tangled and normal conditioner and spray on&#x27;s do nothing to combat it.  This conditioner is exactly what I was looking for.  It is just like the thick conditioners you get in a little tube from shelf hair dyes.  If you&#x27;ve never used hair dye on your own, those conditioners are the best!!!  They are so thick and silky and take the tangles right out.  It is amazing.  This is the closest thing to those that I have found, might be the same thing.  Love it, need it.  Makes her hair so silky soft and keeps it nice all day too,</li>
    <li> Well, this didn&#x27;t work for me...hair still frizzed. It left a weird feeling to my hair.I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> this left my hair so so soft, I don&#x27;t even have to put a detangler in my hair after shampooing it. I&#x27;ve tried many products and this so far is the best. smells very good and sulfate free. a lot of products leave your hair dull but this left my over processed blonde hair really very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Not the best but not the worst. My hair condition didnt really seem to change. Product does have a nice scent that lingers in the hair tho.</li>
    <li> My hair is long (down to buttocks) and hasnt been cut in 12 years.  I needed something for my dry ends (dont cut hair due to religious beliefs).  I bought this product, used it once.  It says leave in for a few minutes, but I shampooed as normal, put about 1/8 cup in my hair and rolled it in a bun and left in for 20 minutes, then rinsed.  I followed up with a coconut milk spray conditioner. Really liked it.  It didn&#x27;t do so much for frizz, but my hair seemed thicker, softer, and more healthy.  I straightened the next day and it didnt go as straight as normal, but still looked good. And the smell is nice too.  The only problem iv&#x27;e found is it makes your tub REALLY slick after you rinse it out of your hair.  I will probably use this weekly/biweekly with oil treatments and coconut milk spray alternately.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product leaves my hair feeling. Hair looks shiny and healthy now</li>
    <li> This product is the best  sulfate and silicone free deep conditioner for my 3c hair. I tried some others and have come back to this.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Sulfate-Free Smoothing System Smoothing Deep Conditioner does a wonderful job of conditioning my hair.  After not conditioning my hair for years, I find I need some type of conditioner.  I put the conditioner on my hair in the shower for about 10 minutes, proceed to wash, and then rinse it out and shampoo.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference when I do this.  I&#x27;m going to try and put the conditioner in my hair for a longer period of time and see if makes a difference.  Or I could put it in my hair overnight and wear a shower cap to bed.  However, 10 minutes does make a difference.</li>
    <li> Good Product, wish it came in a larger container.</li>
    <li> I love the L&#x27;Oreal hair products. Low cost, effective. Hope they do not test on animals because, I will not use this brand.</li>
    <li> Adds shine and controls frizz somewhat but definitely not 100% but what product does</li>
    <li> I use this mask in place of conditioner during humid weather or when I straighten my hair. Love the scent as well. Quickly detangles hair and makes it feel soft. Also use the evercreme mask, recommend them both for anyone with dry or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Tried it out first time today and loved it! It smells great too. I noticed as I left it in for 3.min my hair was super straight and soft although wet. Afyer rinsing, my hair felt great and not very dry as my ends are fried from bleach. As I combed it afyer wash, it was manageable considering I have frizzy curly thin hair. Great product and a great price! Worth the $ and effort.</li>
    <li> Really does smooth hair and does not require a lot of product. Each bottle goes a long way. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great, smoothing conditioner that deep conditions. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love it.... It leaves your hear so smooth and smells great too! Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this after bleaching my hair.  I keep it in for around five minutes twice a week and my hair feels great and it&#x27;s almost completely back to normal!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very soft!  Love that it&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
    <li> The scent smells like extra strong after shave (disgusting) and it left my hair weighed down and greasy. Back to Aphogee 2 minute reconstructor for me. This, will be in the garbage in 1 minute.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different conditioners, but I always find myself coming back to this one. I just wish the smell was lighter.</li>
    <li> Good. Good. Double good.</li>
    <li> Good smell, but leaves my hair like Straw!!!!!! i can&#x27;t even brush it! Never, never will use it again, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery! I love this product and I never rate</li>
    <li> This conditioner is really nice and it works really well to damage and keep up hair, but it doesn&#x27;t have the creamy feel and nice smell of the other L&#x27;Oreal product that comes in a purple jar.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many hair products and spent a lot on salon lines, and this is hands down the best product for thick frizzy hair.  I got a sample of this in the mail and after using it could not believe how smooth my hair was.  I picked up a full size at Ulta and have been hooked.  I use this every day after shampooing and every other day without shampoo (note I do not use any other hair products except a small amount of an oil for fly away&#x27;s).  I am constantly getting compliments on my hair and yes, I have a great hair stylist, but this product makes the cut look great after the salon.  It is a hard product to find on the shelves, ULta is always out of it and a friend searched several stores and finally picked up at a supermarket.  How happy am I that Amazon has it and is a bit cheaper especially with auto ship which I have signed up for as I honestly cannot be without this product.</li>
    <li> The entire L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate-Free line is excellent for my fine hair. This smooths frizz without adding weight. I rotate the conditioners. Can&#x27;t really tell much difference in results.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!!!!!! this is the first time in my life i use a product that leaves my hair sooooo shiny, soooooft and silky!!!!! , i,ve noticed that my hair does not like silicones, my hair has a BKT so i cant use anything with sulfates or sodium or cones (remember that in order to remove most of silicons from your hair you need a shampoo with sulfate which is the fisrt enemy of the BKT), i use the shampoo from keratin research which is the keratin treatment i got (bought here on amazon which i totally recommend) this shampoo is perfect and so soft coz it has no cones, no sodium or sulfates, then i use this deep conditioner and also the defying leave-in creme and OH MY GOD!!!! this is one the moments i worry and think &#x27;i hope they never discontinue this product!!! i just would prefer they make a bigger jar, for my next purchase i will be buying two.</li>
    <li> The conditioner works and smells great but the amount is so small if you have thick hair. Luckily, a little goes a long way, I use it sparingly in sections before getting under a heat cap.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product special at all. Just like any conditioner you use after shampooing your hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money thinking this is a miracle product, because it isn&#x27;t. I bought it for my extremely damaged hair and this conditioner did not make it feel better.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels after using these.  It really is sleek and the frizz seems to go away.  It smells really good too.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter has unrepentant, thick and tangled as the deepest jungle vegatation not chemically/heat treated african hair that has hitherto, proved untameable despite all my effort.  This I have used as a wet conditioner and on dry hair while she bathed and truly, for the first time ever, I have been able to comb her edges without feeling like I am commiting mayhem and murder.  I am amazed.  I have used it twoce thusfar and have about enough for 1 more application.  I intend to try another bottle and decide if this is indeed the manna that I have been looking for, but even she has commented on how wonderful her natural hair feels.  Definate thumbs up from me, and I will test and see if this is indeed \\&quot;all that and more\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I just recently switched to the sulfate free hair care as I was tired of other products overdrying my hair. This line is the best so far. I&#x27;ve been a long time L&#x27;Oreal customer, and as usual this product does not disappoint. I have a lot of very thick, wavy and somewhat coarse hair, and I heat style almost daily. This whole line of products is perfect for my hair. The texture and feel of my hair just keeps getting better, and it seems to be getting easier to get a good straight style with the flat iron. I expect to stay with this conditioner, and this whole line for a while. Especially because the price is so reasonable on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I used to buy it in the store, but found that it was cheaper on Amazon. In addition to being less expensive than those in the store, it also makes my hair soft and shiny. I feel like it gives my hair a little bounce. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  I have natuarally curly hair so it requires more moisture.  I just put it on the ends of my hair each time I shampoo!</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for but a good product still...ty. Good packaging &amp; delivery</li>
    <li> This conditioner has great slip, smells nice, and is very moisturizing.  It contains large amounts of sunflower seed oil, as it is advertised, and leaves your hair very soft.  Also, it has a pretty good value for me--I bought it a couple few months ago, and am not even halfway done with it.  This might not be the case for people with longer or more dry hair, however.</li>
    <li> This product works well for the price however it does have a rather strong scent which I personally do not care for. I will probably continue to use this randomly until the jar has been used but will not reorder due to the strong scent.</li>
    <li> I have let my colored hair go gray this year and it is more unruly than my colored hair.  This product really conditions my hair.  I would caution to only use as directed and as often as directed.  If you have oily or thin hair this may not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> This did not work for my low porosity hair</li>
    <li> I flat iron and blow dry my hair all the time so its verye dry and damaged but this conditiiner makes my hair so soft and smooth i love it. It smells great too</li>
    <li> Nice moisture especially for the price. I have thick colored hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft and shiny. Be sure to rinse it all out or it makes your hair a bit thick/greasy</li>
    <li> We use this product daily.&lt;br /&gt;I even leave this in overnight when hair needs a little extra attention.&lt;br /&gt;Best thing is a little goes a long way!</li>
