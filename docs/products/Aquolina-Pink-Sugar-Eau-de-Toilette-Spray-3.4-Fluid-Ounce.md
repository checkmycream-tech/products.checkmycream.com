    <li> It is VERY sweet so if you don&#x27;t like perfumes that are too sweet then it is not for you. People have told me I smell like a vanilla cookie or cotton candy. It is very subtle not overpowering at all. It definitely lasts and I won&#x27;t wear anything else! I get lots of compliments :)</li>
    <li> Was exactly what it said it was on the description. Love the smell too, it&#x27;s like cupcakes. I am happy.</li>
    <li> this cologne will surprise you when you wear it....i got so many compliments from women and men....you dont really realize people can still smell it after having it on for the day but it last....i had a woman say she liked how marshalls the department store smelled it was my cologne that she was smelling i should of told her..... it seems sweet but has a musk smell about it and it makes it great i dont like sweet smelling perfumes but this one is great try it you probably will like it</li>
    <li> Great product! I bought more for my mom! Going to buy more for Christmas. I get complements all the time!</li>
    <li> Strong vanilla scent. It is my favorite scent because I smell like a vanilla cake or cookies all day. What&#x27;s wrong with that? That&#x27;s the smell of love, baby! :)</li>
    <li> This is my signature everyday scent &amp; I was pleasantly surprised to find it at good price! The top of the bottle leaks a little bit but....I enjoy so much I am not minding as much.</li>
    <li> This smell so good a must have it is light and last all day I will recommend to all my friends</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite of all time!!  The scent works well with my natural scent and I receive several compliments when wearing this.</li>
    <li> I received this item today and it is not what I expected. The listing says 100% authentic, this is a fake. It does not smell the same even though it looks similar.&lt;br /&gt;Spoke to a wonderfully helpful amazon employee who is refunding my money. I advise everyone to look at the AMAZON listed photo and not the customer uploaded photos. I was told that generally what you see in the amazon listed photo is what you will get.&lt;br /&gt;I was at first angry but now am quite pleased that I got such help with this.&lt;br /&gt;It atleast is what is pictured, even if its not authentic.</li>
    <li> I love it on my wife.  Definitely the best perfume ever made.  The amazon price is easily the best. Yeah!</li>
    <li> The scent lasts a good length of the day, and it smells wonderful like cupcakes and cotton candy. I&#x27;ve tried drugstore body sprays marketed as cupcake scented but they&#x27;re overly strong and artificial smelling. This makes me smell edible without that alcohol-y, tacky factor.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and she absolutely loves it..smells delicious, and the smell lasts it doesn&#x27;t fade away. .I would recommend this for anyone who has daughters and or even yourself cause let me be honest I wear it at times as well..</li>
    <li> Do not buy this perfume. It&#x27;s not the real thing. My perfume smells like alcohol. I wish I had read previous reviews before purchasing.</li>
    <li> NICE PERFUME. A GOOD BUY! MY SISTER AND MOM SAY EVERYONE ALWAYS ASKS THEM WHAT PERFUME THEY ARE WEARING. YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume, it smell great and mixes well with me. I get compliments all the time. Seller was great, great price and fast shipping! :)</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I have ever worn that people will stop me and comment own how yummy I smell. This has been a gift request from people that smell it on me. Smells just like cotton candy. Last week someone stopped me and asked if I had been eating sugar cookies because I smelled so good. :)</li>
    <li> I choose five stars for the quick, efficient, friendly service. The product was exactly what I was hoping it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. Not too strong or too sweet or fruity. And I get complements! Ive had a few of my friends buy it now.</li>
    <li> Smells soft and sweet to me. I like it a lot. I gave 4 stars because I have to spray 4-5 sprays to make it last all day and smell it on myself. Very sweet though. Yummy fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and shipped when it said it would. will definetly buy again. I love this perfume so much.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is just like the name implies - like a soft, sugary donut. And you know how men like donuts! People always tell me how great I smell when I&#x27;m wearing it. It&#x27;s a fragrance that everyone likes.</li>

    <li> this is a awesome item I love it its just how it says here I will be ordering soon thanx</li>
    <li> This scent is just simply perfection! It&#x27;s sweet, but not a sickening kind of sweet. It smells EXACTLY like FRESHLY made cotton candy, so there&#x27;s a sense of warmth underneath the sweetness. It&#x27;s not something that I would wear with a suit or when a more sophisticated scent was appropriate..but as my day-to-day casual and go-to scent there&#x27;s nothing better. Women love it and men lose their minds over it..lol..every time I wear it I get compliments from both.</li>
