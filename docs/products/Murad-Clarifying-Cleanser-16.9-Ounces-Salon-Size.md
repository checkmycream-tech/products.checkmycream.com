      <li>this is probably my favorite acne cleanser, It clears up blemishes well without drying out my skin.</li>

      <li>The product, however, is AMAZING - I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, and it&#x27;s hands down the best cleanser if you have acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for over 10 years and it consistently delivers superior results.  </li>
      <li>Great for adult acne!  </li>
      <li>I am happy with it as of now and hopeful my skin will totally clear up.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best buy too -- much cheaper per oz to buy the pro size</li>
      <li>I use to have acne in my T zone and my skin would get oily easy.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any improvements on my face and got strong irritation on my neck.  </li>
      <li>This is such great stuff.</li>
      <li>Great product for moderate acne, both are my teens using it</li>
      <li>This has lasted a long time and works great</li>
      <li>It leaves clean face without drying.</li>
      <li>Got rid of my pimples within a couple weeks - amazing - I&#x27;ve tried so many different products that didn&#x27;t work!   </li>
      <li>paired with Trader Joes tea tree cleanser has been the most effective with my skin (I alternate cleansers for day &amp; night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for my mild acne and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>so I always take the top off and use the cleanser straight from the bottle.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for five years and my skin still feels fresh and clean every time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s seriously the best regimen I have tried.</li>
      <li>Work great thanks... Make bigger bottle please</li>
      <li>I just can no longer use this product after being a loyal customer for years.</li>
      <li>I then use warm steamer or run warm water over the bristles of the small brush attachment and use the brush with my multifunction machine to cleanse.</li>
      <li>The funny part is i have never used the full murad acne treatment kit.</li>
      <li>face wash gave me my confidence, and also my success.. now i model for makeup companies.</li>
      <li>I have tried some of the Murad products before and they worked with my skin just right.</li>
      <li>The pump makes it easy to use and no mess!</li>
      <li>and this is the first ever non-prescription acne wash to work for me, and to work well.</li>
      <li>When I saw this extremely low price I bought this immediately, but when I examined the product and compared my cleanser from sephora with this I wasn&#x27;t sure what to believe.</li>
      <li>This product is the one that keeps my acne consistently under control.  </li>
      <li>I purchased my first Murad cleanser from Sephora, a well-known distributor.</li>
      <li>I love it and will never go back with out it.</li>
      <li>buying it in the super huge bottle (comes with a pump, only use 1/2 of 1 pump is plenty) for 1/2</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it for every condition and all year long.  </li>
      <li>My skin dries and becomes red and irritated easily</li>
      <li>/&gt;They have a trial size at Ulta/Sephora which I suggest buying before you buy the large size of this product.</li>
      <li>so I bought this large size.</li>
      <li>It works very well.  </li>
      <li>but I really needed the cleanser.</li>
      <li>It is very drying, but thats what moisturizer is for.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s reasonable cost for you.</li>
      <li>She uses her products with the Ulta Cleaning Brush (Similar to the Clarisonic) which has kept her face beautiful for the past 6-8 months.</li>
      <li>I ordered this particular item because it still showed as having Triclosan in it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>better than little size of it</li>
      <li>My 16 year old struggled with acne for years with nothing really helping her until she discovered Murad.</li>
      <li>I bought a small bottle at Sephora and loved it, so I bought a bigger bottle here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is very strange how the cleanser turned red in the top inch or so of the pump dispenser.</li>
      <li>I intended to purchase the toner I have normally use since it helps my adult acne around chin area.  </li>
      <li>Having acne, I have tried nearly every acne product on the market.  </li>
      <li>Bigger size is much cheaper.</li>
      <li>and my neck was looking as a neck of 60 years old lady  </li>
      <li>The trick is to not to use extra for very oily skin, but just leave it on your face 5-10 seconds longer.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin with frequent break outs when I skip out on my routine.</li>
      <li>So when I saw this professional size cleanser</li>
      <li>The product also had a slightly different smell, but that might have been because mine was older.</li>
      <li>It cuts through oil, dirt and even make up like no other face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is probably my favorite acne cleanser, It clears up blemishes well without drying out my skin. I have combination skin with frequent break outs when I skip out on my routine. Give it at least two to three weeks before you judge it, you will usually start seeing more break outs in the beginning as your skin starts pulling up all the imputities</li>
    <li> Great cleanser. One of the few things that&#x27;s worked for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff just TOO PRICEY! I&#x27;ve switched to using coconut oil and I love that.</li>
    <li> Best acne product I have ever used. I love the fact that it kills more than 99% in a minute &amp; it works for sure because I can feel the tingling on my face. I&#x27;ve done my research for the best buy &amp; this is it at $31.00 + SH. Deals on Ebay can&#x27;t even beat it on this size.</li>
    <li> Got rid of my pimples within a couple weeks - amazing - I&#x27;ve tried so many different products that didn&#x27;t work!   This is by far the best buy too -- much cheaper per oz to buy the pro size pump bottle vs the smaller tube.</li>
    <li> Changed my skin from having cystic acne to very small pimples if any.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars because I personally love this Murad cleanser. It&#x27;s great for my mild acne and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I purchased my first Murad cleanser from Sephora, a well-known distributor. When I saw this extremely low price I bought this immediately, but when I examined the product and compared my cleanser from sephora with this I wasn&#x27;t sure what to believe. The one I bought from Sephora had an expiration date and a number on the bottom--this bottle does not. The product also had a slightly different smell, but that might have been because mine was older. How do I know that the seller isn&#x27;t selling fake product?</li>
    <li> I intended to purchase the toner I have normally use since it helps my adult acne around chin area.  I made mistake order this item as toner but I will use it later when my cleaner is gone. The smell is good though.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  It makes my skin feel soooo clean!!  What an AWESOME Deal this product is in the larger bottle!!  I kept my old smaller bottle and refilled it!!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old struggled with acne for years with nothing really helping her until she discovered Murad. Her face is 99% clear with an occasional breakout monthly. She uses her products with the Ulta Cleaning Brush (Similar to the Clarisonic) which has kept her face beautiful for the past 6-8 months. We would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Having acne, I have tried nearly every acne product on the market.  This product is the one that keeps my acne consistently under control.  Not sure what the secret is-- I only know it works for me.  I use it with a rotating Olay face scrubber, and then follow up with the Murad Skin Perfecting lotion.  It&#x27;s seriously the best regimen I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with my skin. The murad seems to help a little but doesn&#x27;t completely clear up my acne. I have always had good results with murad products.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Way cheaper on Amazon than Ulta, also. Same quality.</li>
    <li> Always looking for great quality products that don&#x27;t test on animals. Look no further.</li>
    <li> Excellent daily cleanser for oily, acne prone skin. Does not overdry.</li>
    <li> i have problematic acne-prone skin. using this 2x/day and noticed the reduced oil accumulation in my skin. feels great.</li>
    <li> Work great thanks... Make bigger bottle please</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser! buying it in the super huge bottle (comes with a pump, only use 1/2 of 1 pump is plenty) for 1/2 the price is awesome! Plus it came to my door quicker than the site quoted!</li>
    <li> Arrived with a broken nozzle so I&#x27;m having to pour REALLY slowly to get it into my other bottle that I keep in the shower, which is very annoying. The product, however, is AMAZING - I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, and it&#x27;s hands down the best cleanser if you have acne prone skin. Seems to really do a great job cleansing the skin without overdrying. Even does a great job getting on my super staying foundation!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price .. and i love this product . its cheaper then getting the smaller one online. more for $</li>
    <li> The best cleanser for sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days now, morning and night. I have a lot of pimples around my mouth area. In the mornings I noticed 3-5 little whiteheads. I was hoping it was just getting rid of everything that was under my skin. I think I was right because there have been less whiteheads in the morning as time has passed. It is very drying, but thats what moisturizer is for. I am happy with it as of now and hopeful my skin will totally clear up. I will leave an update when more time has passed.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser out there. My young adult acne has decreased by at least 50%. Works best with a clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost two years now and it&#x27;s wonderful.  I decided to get the larger bottle so I did not have to purchase as often.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and it consistently delivers superior results.  Not perfect, but definitely better when I use it vs. when I do not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every acne product on the market and this is the first ever non-prescription acne wash to work for me, and to work well. My face has cleared up substantially, and I&#x27;ve been complemented on my skin.</li>
    <li> This face wash is so great! I bought a small bottle at Sephora and loved it, so I bought a bigger bottle here on Amazon. It cuts through oil, dirt and even make up like no other face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t even have acne but it has cleared the few pimples I usually get. Be careful about using it too much though - I am super oily and if I use it more than twice in a day, it dried out my skin pretty bad.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way with this cleanser making it worth the price. I apply to dry face half a pump. I then use warm steamer or run warm water over the bristles of the small brush attachment and use the brush with my multifunction machine to cleanse. The cleanser foams up nicely and does a great job cleansing but not stripping the skin.</li>
    <li> Have used this now for years and I absolutely love it.  This is a great deal to get the professional size for a good price.</li>
    <li> This cleanser worked best for me so I bought this large size. It is very strange how the cleanser turned red in the top inch or so of the pump dispenser. I don&#x27;t trust using that so I always take the top off and use the cleanser straight from the bottle. This has lasted a long time and works great so I take just one star of for the strange phenomenon of it turning a purplish red color.</li>
    <li> Bigger size is much cheaper. The product is the best I have ever used for acne. It leaves clean face without drying.</li>
    <li> Very good works great . Been using for years !!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this so I didn&#x27;t have to keep going to the store for more acne cleanser. I used it daily and it didn&#x27;t get rid of my acne. I admit, I was lazy and should of used it 2-3 times per day like I do now. I feel it was incredibly expensive and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have acne around my nose and on my chin.  This is always a part of my morning routine. Cuts down the oil and keeps the acne away when paired with the spot treatment. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and can&#x27;t find anything that works better for my face.</li>
    <li> Love this, it works and is NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS! Proving we don&#x27;t need to to create great products.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a while. Great cleanser, best price I have found. Will order again</li>
    <li> This cleanser is one of my holy grail products. I found it over a year ago and I will never stop buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paired with Trader Joes tea tree cleanser has been the most effective with my skin (I alternate cleansers for day &amp; night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a trial size at Ulta/Sephora which I suggest buying before you buy the large size of this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried some of the Murad products before and they worked with my skin just right. So when I saw this professional size cleanser I was very exited, but after few days of using it I got very disappointed with results. I didn&#x27;t see any improvements on my face and got strong irritation on my neck.  It was itching so bad and my neck was looking as a neck of 60 years old lady  ( I am just 23). After i stopped to use this product irritation was gone.</li>
    <li> Terrific and I just love the pump!!</li>
    <li> Great product for moderate acne, both are my teens using it and it works well for them, if they use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this particular item because it still showed as having Triclosan in it. I knew Murad had removed the Triclosan, but was hoping I was purchasing one of the few remaining bottles floating around out there with sellers that still had Triclosan in it...but seems the seller just hadn&#x27;t updated the ingredient list yet (and still haven&#x27;t.) Murad has removed the Triclosan and replaced it with Silver Citrate, which basically ruined the cleanser for me. Silver Citrate does NOT do what Triclosan does for killing bacteria that irritates my rosacea. I tried this anyway, and immediately broke out. I just can no longer use this product after being a loyal customer for years. Bring back the Triclosan, Murad! :(</li>
    <li> This is the best face cleanser on the market!!! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is such great stuff. The pump makes it easy to use and no mess! Everyone should use this product!</li>
    <li> I use this daily to help keep my face clear.  It works very well.  I can tell when I miss a day or two.  The trick is to not to use extra for very oily skin, but just leave it on your face 5-10 seconds longer.</li>
    <li> Getting tired of spending, money and wasting time on acne treatments that don&#x27;t work? well i was! I started using murad about 5 years ago. I have tried proactive, clearisal, prescription face washes, chinese remedies, masks, peels, facials... anything to make my skin clear. The only thing worked was Murad! I have been using it for five years and my skin still feels fresh and clean every time. I literally do not get acne at all anymore... even during my periods. The funny part is i have never used the full murad acne treatment kit. Only the acne cleanser. I love it and will never go back with out it. It can be a little more expensive but its worth it when your confidence comes back. Try it... you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;p.s I use to have acne in my T zone and my skin would get oily easy. Now it dries up the extra oil but doesn&#x27;t make you skin dry at all, you know like the dry that feels like your skin is being pulled straight back and be all itchy.&lt;br /&gt;This face wash gave me my confidence, and also my success.. now i model for makeup companies.</li>
    <li> Murad Clarifying Cleanser Acne Line Pro Size 16.9&lt;br /&gt;way better than little size of it&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s reasonable cost for you.</li>
    <li> Great for adult acne!  My skin has never looked better since I began using it.  My skin dries and becomes red and irritated easily but I have not had this problem with this cleanser.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Never buy any other cleanser for your face.  No matter what your age, I swear by it, you&#x27;ll be hooked.  I was always buying, age appropriate, cleansers and was never happy.  I would have to buy different washes and cleansers for different conditions and it cost a fortune.  My face would dry out with one and break out with another.  I was crazy!  Buy Murad.  You&#x27;ll love it for every condition and all year long.  It will save your skin and $.</li>
    <li> When I received the product ( that I thought I ordered) it was very poorly packaged. It ended up busting open and the Post Office had to put it in a sealed bag, with it leaking everywhere. Then I discovered that It was not in fact the cleanser that I thought I ordered but the astringent. They gave me my money back and let me keep the astringent but I really needed the cleanser.</li>
