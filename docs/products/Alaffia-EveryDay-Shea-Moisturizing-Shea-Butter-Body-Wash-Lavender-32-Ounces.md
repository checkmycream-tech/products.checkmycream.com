      <li>This is a great gluten free option for body wash.</li>
      <li>It lasts a nice while too.</li>
      <li>However, the soap does leave a very, very mild and pleasant scent on my skin.</li>
      <li>We also purchase their bubble bath products and they are one of the best we have tried so far.</li>
      <li>Also comes in a nice large pump bottle, which is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an excellent soap containing wonderfully gentle ingredients that actually do clean my skin without any irritation whatsoever.</li>
      <li>It spells nice, not too strong.</li>
      <li>Love this body wash.</li>
      <li>It smells great when dispensed and lathers up very well.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?  </li>
      <li>This soap smells fantastic and is a wonderful natural product.  </li>
      <li>I am not one to want to smell overwhelming, but there is clean-feeling smell whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>And the ingredients in it are super awesome for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Clean is odorless not a perfume!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful at preventing and clearing skin breakout due to the neem oil in it.</li>
      <li>I have used Everyday Shea wash and lotion for almost 5 years now and I have been very happy with their products.</li>
      <li>and it is lightly fragrant.  </li>
      <li>The smell is amazing, it is gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin soft and smell good too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Everyday Shea Moisturizing Body Wash in the Vanilla Mint scent and love it!!!</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this item to any and all who want to not only cleanse themselves with a wonderful product, but who also care about this planet and the ways in which we sustain it and ourselves.</li>
      <li>However, just as soon after drying off with a clean towel, there is no trace of the lavendar scent on me.  </li>
      <li>I gave it two stars for lathering up so well and getting me clean, but I deducted three becasue</li>
      <li>Frankly, I don&#x27;t want to walk out of my house smelling like a lavender field in full bloom after using any soap.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, the lavender scent in the soap is a very mild scent.</li>
      <li>Not only is it 100% natural and fair trade, but it smells fantastic and leaves a nice soft touch on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Great mild organic body wash and shampoo for the little ones.</li>
      <li>Great for winter dry skin and a very nice subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
      <li>I find this body wash to be deeply moisturizing; invigorating in it&#x27;s pleasing light lavender scent, leaving me feeling fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>This product is refreshing and does not dry my skin.  </li>
      <li>I once went to a winery in Marin, the one that has a Lavender Field, and remember this scent is very much alike.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, not too soapy and the scent actually stays to my skin.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll order online again, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally in stores.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, my Whole Foods is no longer carrying it.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t lather up much.</li>
      <li>Not only are they natural ingredients, but this is also a Fair Trade item which only adds to my desire to support the company by purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s first ingredient is Neem which is antibacterial and by chance it happened to clear up pimples that I had been dealing with on my face and couldn&#x27;t get rid of.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The bottle was able to move around a little in the box and the plunger broke during shipment and spilled the contents in the box.  </li>
      <li>and it is watery (IMO) in comparison to the exact same product in vanilla mint.</li>
      <li>smells so good, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out with a wonky PH like Dr Bronner&#x27;s does.</li>
      <li>I had been buying this product at my local Whole Foods Market and have been using it for about 2 years now.</li>
      <li>Clean fresh smell but not a great moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is from natural essential oils so the fragrance is going to rinse away and not stay on your skin like chemical fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Secondly, there are no added perfumes or fillers which are generally the ingredients that can cause irritation to the skin.</li>
      <li>As in with the other reviews I read, the product is very runny and doesn&#x27;t have much later.</li>
      <li>(I have extraordinarily dry and sensitive skin.)</li>
      <li>We were buying it at Whole Foods and needed it and did not have time to run an hour and a half for this.</li>
      <li>Gentle on my little one&#x27;s skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Purchased some of this body wash.  It smells great when dispensed and lathers up very well.  However, just as soon after drying off with a clean towel, there is no trace of the lavendar scent on me.  I am not one to want to smell overwhelming, but there is clean-feeling smell whatsoever.  The shampoo of the same scent has the same results.  I gave it two stars for lathering up so well and getting me clean, but I deducted three becasue I don&#x27;t smell like it afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great mild organic body wash and shampoo for the little ones. A little goes a long way, foam up nicely, don&#x27;t dry up skin or hair, don&#x27;t sting eyes and it is lightly fragrant.

    <li> This is a great product that we continually buy. We were buying it at Whole Foods and needed it and did not have time to run an hour and a half for this. Looked and found it on Amazon and now will buy it here regularly. Makes your skin soft and smell good too.</li>
    <li> The sent is amazing and moisturizers well. Didn&#x27;t lather up much.</li>
    <li> Clean fresh smell but not a great moisturizer.  might need to invest in an additional product to fight winter dryness.</li>
    <li> This product is refreshing and does not dry my skin.  I like the fragrance, the moisturizing effect, and the fact that it is a fair trade item.</li>
    <li> Great for winter dry skin and a very nice subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t stay on.  No itchy skin either.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this body wash!  The smell is amazing, it is gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash. I actually have Ichthyosis vulgaris and this is the only body wash that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like if its going to crack! I would defensively recommend. And the ingredients in it are super awesome for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash , it has no chemicals at all and cleans real good without clogging the pores of my skin . 5 stars it is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Everyday Shea Moisturizing Body Wash in the Vanilla Mint scent and love it!!! So, I decided to branch out and try the Everyday Shea Moisturizing Body Wash in Lavender as I ADORE THE SMELL OF LAVENDER. Boy, was I ever disappointed in this product because it doesn&#x27;t smell like to lavender to me and it is watery (IMO) in comparison to the exact same product in vanilla mint. I won&#x27;t be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Usually  I prefer bar soap, but this one was on sale so I decided to try it. I once went to a winery in Marin, the one that has a Lavender Field, and remember this scent is very much alike.  I love the smell, not too soapy and the scent actually stays to my skin. I approve this product. Definitely would recommend this shower gel for Lavender fan.</li>
    <li> I have used this body wash for a few years now and I really like it.  I have very dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t leave it dry and tight like some soaps.  I lost about 20% of the contents of the bottle during shipping.  The bottle was able to move around a little in the box and the plunger broke during shipment and spilled the contents in the box.  Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll order online again, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally in stores.</li>
    <li> Nice lather and smells great.  Gentle on my little one&#x27;s skin. I have used Everyday Shea wash and lotion for almost 5 years now and I have been very happy with their products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It&#x27;s wonderful at preventing and clearing skin breakout due to the neem oil in it. It lasts a nice while too. Besides it helps other ppl at the same time. I love it</li>

    <li> I had been buying this product at my local Whole Foods Market and have been using it for about 2 years now. Unfortunately, my Whole Foods is no longer carrying it. Hugely disappointed, I turned to Amazon in hopes of finding it again. Voila!  Here it is and I feel like giving three cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent soap containing wonderfully gentle ingredients that actually do clean my skin without any irritation whatsoever. (I have extraordinarily dry and sensitive skin.) Not only are they natural ingredients, but this is also a Fair Trade item which only adds to my desire to support the company by purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer mentioned that there was no lasting lavender scent after drying off. There&#x27;s a reason for that. First and foremost, the lavender scent in the soap is a very mild scent. Secondly, there are no added perfumes or fillers which are generally the ingredients that can cause irritation to the skin. Frankly, I don&#x27;t want to walk out of my house smelling like a lavender field in full bloom after using any soap. However, the soap does leave a very, very mild and pleasant scent on my skin. I HIGHLY recommend this item to any and all who want to not only cleanse themselves with a wonderful product, but who also care about this planet and the ways in which we sustain it and ourselves.</li>
