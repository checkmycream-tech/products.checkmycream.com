<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This brand of brushes are great. I have yet to be disappointed.  I have had all sorts, sephora, mac,  sigma. These seem to be the only brand that has lasted through them. And the price is great too!</li>
    <li> excellent!! The price is so good and this brush is so soft and multitask. I use it for powder, bronzer, blush, highlither..</li>
    <li> I bought this for contouring my cheekbones and sides of my nose and I can&#x27;t recommend it for that. The bristles are so soft (and don&#x27;t get me wrong - I adore the EcoTools brushes, but some of them just aren&#x27;t that functional) that it can only be used with SUPER soft powder products for a light application (say, a blush or highlighter, but that&#x27;s about it). Otherwise it&#x27;s just an exercise in frustration trying to get the product onto the brush because you really have to rub rub rub. It&#x27;s also rather large and fluffy, so not ideal for contouring. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll use it for since I already have good blush brushes, but the hunt continues!</li>
    <li> The EcoTools fan brush has a great balance of density and flexibility; it is also thick enough to do more than just highlight, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> This brush is definitely not meant for highlighting. Maybe contouring because this brush is just way too dense and thick.</li>
    <li> I love this fan brush -- perfect for applying my powder highlight. It&#x27;s not as wide as other fan brushes, which is perfect because I wanted more precision in my application. I especially love the dense-ness of this brush, because it really helps pick up the powder and allow me to pat it on. Incredibly soft as well!</li>
    <li> Best brush you will ever use.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, good quality, thick, sturdy brush with super soft bristles. I love this brush and use it to apply my finishing and setting powders after I apply my makeup. It is awesome! I love it and it was a great price for such a good quality brush.</li>
    <li> I love Ecotools products!!! I am in love with my fan brush soo soft and gentle.</li>
    <li> Just arrived. Its unexpected soft. I realy like that. Quality! I don&#x27;t know jet.</li>
    <li> I use this fan brush to apply blush. It is extremely soft, built solid, obviously great quality, and works beautifully! Very happy with this purchase. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush, it is very soft and its shape is perfect for the makeup final touch. Is wider than other fan brush for the same purpose, but i like it better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried virtually every brand of makeup brushes in the market: from the most expensive to the really inexpensive drug store ones. These are absolutely the best. Excellent price, do not shed and very, very soft, thus gentle on your sensitive skin! Love them!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very soft.</li>
    <li> Super soft! Applies very nicely. LOVE IT! Came brand new. The reusable packaging is genius! Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this fan brush!! Like all of my other Eco-Tools brushes, this one is durable (doesn&#x27;t shed) and is high quality. I use this to blend everything at the end of my makeup routine. Basically, blending the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; shape from my bronzer, with blush, with foundation just to ensure I don&#x27;t have any noticeable lines. I highly recommend this brush and purchase it on Amazon, because it&#x27;s cheaper here than it was at several stores I checked in the area (even walmart :/)</li>
    <li> I must say this is a good fan brush! Now this might be a little too big for proper precision but it is angled, so that helps. I really liked the eco-friendly packaging and the feel of the brush. It is great for highlighting, I&#x27;m still trying to find other uses for this brush.</li>
    <li> I have the elf fan brush which is extremely thin compared to this brush. I bought this one because I heard ecotools quality is great and it definitely is. this brush is thick and sturdy, which is great for blending highlight, contour and blush.</li>
    <li> the brush is well made and has a nice handle. the brush itself is dense and very soft. the brush is thick and sturdy so it is good for bronzing and highlighting. it makes well blended straight lines as you would for bronzing/highlighting very easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for contouring the face with.. #beginner&lt;br /&gt;I missed the part on the detail page that said it was deluxe... had I noticed that, I probably would have went with another choice. The thickness is not what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are super soft and do not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for my highlight exclusively. I LOVE this brand. These are such high quality brushes I can&#x27;t believe I bought them online. Everything from the case, to the handle, to the bristles are perfect and soft and sturdy. I will be buying all new brushes of this brand.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes for my face so soft.wish they made more variety because I would buy every single one of them</li>
    <li> really soft fan brush! perfect for applying highlighter or dusting eyeshadow out from under eyes or dusting excess powder off of the face. sturdy handle doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my brush cup. i&#x27;ve used and washed this brush quite a bit and it is still holding up well with no shedding. can&#x27;t beat this brush for the price!!</li>
    <li> While searching for make-up brushes that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank, I came across this brand.  The reviews were good and the price was right, so I made the purchase.  I have not been using these brushes for long, so I will update my review as to their longevity later...but quality wise, I am LOVING my purchase.  The brush is very soft, and definitely does everything it advertises.  The bristles are not falling out while I use it, which is something I definitely am happy about.  My mother-in-law bought a set of these brushes and faithfully used them for three years.  She swears by this brand, and so far, I&#x27;m loving my experience too!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I have had much luck with the Ecotools brand. Everything I bought has been super soft and great quality. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Great soft and fluffy bristles! Works well for light powder application and bronzer application as it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product. It&#x27;s a bit large for blush application IMO.</li>
    <li> This is good looking brush but just a bit to soft to use on my face or maybe I just haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> It is a bit bulky but it&#x27;s beautiful. Does its job wonderfully. I can use it for highlighters and over all powders.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for highlighter and bronzer!!! The bristles are so soft and holds just the right amount of product!!! If you are a true ecotools user and are happy with the results you get from your own brushes; you will absolutely love this!!!</li>
    <li> Great brush for highlighting! Super soft and at a great price.</li>
    <li> This was a super fluffy brush with a sturdy bamboo handle and delicate bristles that don&#x27;t shed.  It&#x27;s such a good value and is way better than some of the higher end fan brushes I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specs:&lt;br /&gt;- The handle is bamboo.&lt;br /&gt;- The bristles are made of synthetic Taklon. They are cruelty free!&lt;br /&gt;- The brush is made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for contouring and for those final swipes of finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush holds up to gentle washing and drying.</li>
    <li> This is the softest brush I have ever used! Forget those rough and expensive ones, like MAC.  Eco Tools are divine.</li>
    <li> Good quality, it feels really soft on the skin</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Nice and full.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this brush would be a thinner width than it is. The length of the brush head is fine, but it&#x27;s the bristles are about 1/3 inch thick. Other than that the quality is very nice and the bristles are soft.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush for face. Who needs fancy brushes when ecotools is super soft and way cheaper. This is the perfect fan size for smaller faces. Not too wide, super fluffy and soft. I use this with highlighter, all over bronzer and sometimes my finishing powder. Just what I&#x27;m in the mood for and I always want to grab it</li>
    <li> I was in the search of a bursh like this, I&#x27;m not a makeup pro but this is great! good size, soft and works great!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush to contour my face, I use it to apply bronzer for contouring of course, if it&#x27;s clean (I only have one) I also use it to dust any excess powder of my face but this is my go to brush for contouring with bronzer :)</li>
    <li> Awesome brush!!! It&#x27;s so so soft and it feels great on the skin. Perfect for contouring or using on the cheekbones. I will buy ecotools again</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome!  Perfect for contouring!!  Very soft and thick, I love it.  It contours so nicely and is so affordable.  Just as good as the Nars Ita brush for a 1/5 of the cost.</li>
    <li> Very soft and disperses makeup well!</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Worth it. Very soft brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. No complaints. Arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Decent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect highlighting brush. It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much or too little product and it transfers beautifully. I have washed it with alcohol and Dr. Bonner&#x27;s castile soap and its is holding up nicely.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a decent fan brush. After the fourth try this one is a keeper. The others were too flimsy/thin, shed too much, or kept &#x27;bleeding&#x27; dye...this brush is good quality. The hairs pick up product, have not shed a hair (daily &#x27;spot&#x27; cleaning, weekly shampoo...), and feel soft. If you are looking for a dainty fan brush just to deposit highlighter, this may not be the one. This brush is a bit &#x27;plusher&#x27; of the usual fan brushes.</li>
    <li> If I could give this 6 stars, I would. I&#x27;ve been looking for a big fan brush for AWHILE! When I found this and received it in the mail I was SOOO happy! The problem I have with smaller brushes is I feel like it doesn&#x27;t brush away all of the loose makeup under my eye, and with this it works great! It goes from having a bunch of loose colorful pigments under my eye to no color at all. I love this brush, and I love EcoTools!</li>
    <li> A lot of the beauty guru&#x27;s I subscribe to use fan brushes to lightly apply blush and highlighter. I usually like to try drug store brand brushes before I purchase professional ones from MAC or Sigma. This EcoTools really amazed me! It&#x27;s super soft and does the job perfectly :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Ecotools brushes.  This brush is no different.  Great quality, sturdy - no bristle fallout.  Very soft and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with my liquid makeup --- helps to smooth it out after I get it on my face.  It isn&#x27;t flimsy and has body to it so you can actually move the makeup or powder around.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> This brush is sooo soft and fluffy.  I use it for my highlight and I absolutely LOVE it.  It may be cheaper buying it at Walmart or Ulta, but at the time of purchase I just added it to a bigger order.</li>
    <li> Looooooove this brush!!! Must try!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; as broadly as I thought it would after a good cleaning, but maintains shape through use and washing, doesn&#x27;t shed and caused no irritation.  Good Brush!</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic! It&#x27;s super soft! A must have in your makeup brush collection. It&#x27;s perfect for highlighting. Or even a soft contouring effect. Would definitely reccomend this brush to my fellow makeup lovers. xoxo</li>
    <li> Great brush! Perfect for applying blush. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Super soft brush, perfect for highlighting. No bristle fallout! Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> An overall wonderful product. I love the Ecotools brushes, and hadn&#x27;t seen this shape/style of brush in the local stores. So, after watching it on Amazon for a while, I decided to splurge.  It&#x27;s a better quality than some of the other brands&#x27; fan brushes I&#x27;ve had...no shedding, soft, even texture, &amp; picks up powder evenly.  I love this brush, and am glad I got it.  I haven&#x27;t had it all that long yet, so I have not had to clean it &amp; can&#x27;t give any feedback on if it sheds during or after washing.  But, so far, there&#x27;s been no shedding, and the brush&#x27;s head (ferrule) is a very secure one on the base (no wobbling or danger of falling off).  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I enjoy my makeup brushes a lot and this one is very nice and useful. I actually use it to apply some translucent powder under my eyes while I put my makeup on my eyelids. That way at the end I just use this brush and swipe away all the translucent powder and all the leftovers from the makeup and it looks nice and clean.</li>
    <li> I had recently bought some gold blush dust and needed a more delicate fan brush to put it on. I already have a foundation brush by Eco Tools and love it so I knew exactly which fan brush I was going to buy. It does the job great, is easy to clean, and never gets stiff or lose any of its bristles.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this purchase.. Thank you Ecotools, for making wonderfully made products at an unbeatable price!! by far surpasses the Sonia Kashuk brushes I used before..</li>
    <li> This brush is of a very good quality and is easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;I always wash my new brushes with baby shampoo before first use, and this brush held its shape and softness after that.  Though it feels as soft as mink, the bristles have enough resistance to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;So far I used it only once, but it did exactly what I needed it to do: place extra powder under my eyes for a shadow fall off, then flick it off after I was done. It also did beautifully to set my liquid foundation with powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first brush I purchased from this brand name, and call me impressed.</li>
    <li> I was surprised the bristles were really soft. Good for contouring and you cant beat the price. Havent washed it yet so cant speak to how it will feel after.</li>
    <li> Great brush....purchased after researching on YouTube.  Works great to highlight or contour.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft!</li>
    <li> Nice and soft. Applies very well.</li>
    <li> I was trying to use it as a contour brush on the side of my nose and the cheek bone. But apparently this brush doesn&#x27;t work in my favor..</li>
    <li> Really soft and perfect to apply a shimmer!  A bit big but in a nice way!! Good quality!!!</li>
    <li> I really like eco brushes but this brush I wished had a little more firmness to it.  it is too soft when applying and I have to go over several times to make sure my foundation gets in.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for contouring! I&#x27;ve also washed it twice &amp; hasn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush. Soft bristles that won&#x27;t scratch your face. Picks up a lot of makeup product for a synthetic bristle brush. Seems well constructed, I have not had any issues with bristles shedding.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush. It has a really sturdy construction and looks attractive on my makeup stand. And I appreciate that it is eco-friendly. But the brush head is really big. I like it for lightly applying powder to my face, but I found the brush head to be too big for highlighter or blush.</li>
    <li> Absolutley love love love this fan brush! Every Gam Girl should have one. My FAV makeup tool.</li>
    <li> ecotools make amazing brushes &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> got this to use with a powdered all over luminizer works with a delicate touch good brush</li>
    <li> I only bought this brush to dust off the banana powder after I let it sit on my face for a while. I love it honestly, but I can&#x27;t find another reason to use it. That&#x27;s not the fault of the brush, it&#x27;s my inexperience with makeup that&#x27;s to blame. All in all I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this brush. I know that under the eyes is a very sensitive area that needs to be handled delicately and this brush does just that. A+</li>
    <li> Bigger than expected but great otherwise</li>
    <li> great set...great price</li>
    <li> Love this brush for highlighting.</li>
    <li> this is comparable to the louise young fan brush, it&#x27;s big and full so you can swipe it across your face (cheeks, forehead and middle) for a light dusting of powder or you can use it with more precision for highlighting. I love that it so full and fluffy.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It is very soft and luxurious, and is the only way I will apply my powder anymore.  It is very nice for final blending and finishing.</li>
    <li> Totally love eco&#x27;s renewed brush! Soft feel bristle just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great for applying facial highlight/ illuminizer!</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft, love it, amazing to use for my countour I don&#x27;t know how I did it with out it, because I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
    <li> This fan brush is amazing, very soft. Perfect brush for highlighting.</li>
    <li> I love ecotools ever since i found this brand and I have so many of their brushes. Always wanted a fan brush and its ecotools! incredibly soft on the skin. Have not used it yet but washed it. I thought of using this for my cheek highlighter but we&#x27;ll have to see.</li>
