      <li>I&#x27;m 80 years old and still using it,  I think its great,</li>
      <li>So happy to find a source for an old standby.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to make the mistake as the packaging is identical.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wildroot Hair Groom for over 50 years and it has always been the same great product.  </li>
      <li>I would give the \\&quot;Original Wildroot,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>and I could never get that perfect slick look before Wildroot.</li>
      <li>namely, Murray&#x27;s, Brylcreem, Groom and Clean, Vitalis, and Wildroot.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for hair that tends to be on the dry side.  </li>
      <li>And the price was right!  </li>
      <li>At age 83 my hair grows so fast using this product that I have to get a haircut more than once a month.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your hair feeling soft and hydrated, with a nice sheen, without gunking it all up.  </li>
      <li>As I started growing out my hair from a buzz cut I quickly realized hat</li>
      <li>Adding a light &#x27;coat&#x27; of Murray&#x27;s super light after using Wildroot can really give one a classic style and will still washout without having to whip out the dish detergent!</li>
      <li>I thought it&#x27;d make a fun gift for Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know which is the right one:  </li>
      <li>My mom put it in her hair right away</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my father, who is 87 years old and has been using it for many, many years and cannot find it at local drugstores any  longer.  </li>
      <li>(although otherwise an excellent product), has more hold and sheen than Vitalis (although that stuff is great for casual occasions), and definitely way less greasy and easier to remove than Murray&#x27;s pomade.</li>
      <li>nice product for dry scalp</li>
      <li>/&gt;FYI, I just received a newly ordered bottle of \\&quot;Original Wildroot.\\&quot;  BEWARE -</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d look it up to see if it was still being made....and sure enough</li>
      <li>I think it brought them back, cute.</li>
      <li>Only reason I don&#x27;t love it is greasy hands after application.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Wildroot Original The Natural Looking Hair Groom.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I started listening to Old Time Radio and love the old commercials.</li>
      <li>It is much thicker, does not spread as easily, and the scent is different.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but when I got it, it came in a HUGE bottle (and for only 8 bucks).</li>
      <li>WORKS BETTER WHEN HAIR IS WET.  </li>
      <li>Really keeps the hair neat all day.</li>
      <li>and it made my hair very shiny.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been using it his whole life.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and it is no longer available in local drugstores.  </li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Really recommend this product.</li>
      <li>which is decidely NOT the original formula, only two or three stars.  </li>
      <li>I came directly to Amazon (as I can find anything I need on Amazon!!) and ordered the large size.  </li>
      <li>Works much better than what I previously used.</li>
      <li>who don&#x27;t remember their Wildroot Creme Oil Charlie commercials more than half a century ago word for word?</li>
      <li>I have used - and still use - the 5 classic products mentioned on the Art of Manliness blog:</li>
      <li>I normally would get this item at Kmart</li>
      <li>Definitely well worth trying.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a new product for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about 65</li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s a new stock?  </li>
      <li>Product was very old, had to mix with water.</li>
      <li>I know it is advertized as original but does not have same texture meaning it is far too thick!&lt;br /&gt;Useable, helps dry scalp.</li>
      <li>It really seems like the same old product.</li>
      <li>Years ago it came in a clear glass container.  </li>
      <li>is it thicker because it is old stock?  </li>
      <li>It performs just as advertised and really gives hair a terrific look  and</li>
      <li>Not a popular product any more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it since I was a kid, I still do and I&#x27;m 83 years old.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t tell how much to use, so I&#x27;m going to have to experiment more</li>
      <li>This is an old school product....</li>
      <li>Grooms hair well and leaves it soft</li>
      <li>It leaves his hair soft and nourished.</li>
      <li>My hair is very straight and dry</li>
      <li>And like they said in the original ads &amp;#34;A Little Dab will do Yah&amp;#34;.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, even though bottle changed shape from what I know it as. It is still very similar conditioner. Recommend seller.</li>
    <li> I love wildroot I ran out a couple of  my wifes mouse didn&#x27;t cut it months ago and was lost without it. Thank you wildroot</li>
    <li> I remember Wildroot Cream Oil from wayyyyy back in the day.  It&#x27;s great for hair that tends to be on the dry side.  Pour a little in the palm of your hand (It&#x27;s like Brylcreem; a little dab&#x27;ll do ya), work it through your hair and brush or comb it through.  It leaves your hair feeling soft and hydrated, with a nice sheen, without gunking it all up.  You can use it on dry or wet hair; it tends to work better when your hair is slightly wet.  Towel-dry it after washing and then work the Wildroot through it while it&#x27;s still damp (only use a comb if it&#x27;s damp; never brush wet hair unless you want a head full of split ends) and style as usual when it&#x27;s dry.  You&#x27;ll see a definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy Lind</li>
    <li> A great tonic for the beard, smells great, and after you comb out your beard, it stays better looking.</li>
    <li> Grooms hair well and leaves it soft but my scalp breaks out.  I should note that I have very sensitive skin and have to be VERY careful what I put on my hair.</li>
    <li> I normally would get this item at Kmart but they stopped carrying it.  The one they carried was much smaller and for almost the price of this larger bottle.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> my dad started us using it when I was in the fourth grade.&lt;br /&gt;now I&#x27;m 80 years old and still using it,  I think its great,</li>
    <li> I of course enjoy using wildroot hair cream.  I have been a user since the late 1950&#x27;s .  At one time they also made one in a tube that was excellent as I was traveling lots and was perfect for a shaving kit.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR HAIR THAT IS VERY DRY.  WORKS BETTER WHEN HAIR IS WET.  IF YOU HAVE CURLY HAIR IT WILL STRAIGHTEN YOUR CURLS OUT.</li>
    <li> Only reason I don&#x27;t love it is greasy hands after application.  Great on the hair!</li>
    <li> Not a popular product any more. CVS stopped carrying it. But I have used it since being a youngster. Have tried other products from time to time. But keep using this.</li>
    <li> i have used this product from a young man, they have changed their formula no grease no mess and big value for your dolla, again thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I could no longer find it at my local retailers, so I had to look for it on-line.</li>
    <li> This is an old school product....but it&#x27;s always worked for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this product. My hair is very straight and dry and I could never get that perfect slick look before Wildroot. Now I&#x27;m A-OK, all day. Follow the other reviewer&#x27;s advice and comb it into your hair after towel drying.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my dad. He&#x27;s been using it his whole life. He loves it! It leaves his hair soft and nourished.</li>
    <li> I purchased for a friend because it&#x27;s not available in the local stores, and he likes it better than other products.</li>
    <li> I started listening to Old Time Radio and love the old commercials. I look up the products on the internet out of curiosity, or I ask my parents if they remember them. They both remembered Wildroot Cream Oil and when I saw it on Amazon I thought it&#x27;d make a fun gift for Father&#x27;s Day. My dad got a kick out of it and said it smelled just as he remembered as a kid. My mom put it in her hair right away haha. I think it brought them back, cute.</li>
    <li> It performs just as advertised and really gives hair a terrific look  and feeland feel with a subtle and pleasing scent all this without that greasy hair look and feel</li>
    <li> Yesterday I found it a Walgrens for $8.29 (slightly smaller bottle at 8 ounces).  Wallyworld don&#x27;t seem to carry it locally--shisters.  Its a very good hand creme for the back of the hands too.  They have picked a poor time to try to price themselves out of the market especially when their market is dwindling.  Still a good product tho and who don&#x27;t remember their Wildroot Creme Oil Charlie commercials more than half a century ago word for word?</li>
    <li> My partner wanted only this product as it is the one he has used and likes.  So I had to go online to find it as the stores no longer carry this product.  I came directly to Amazon (as I can find anything I need on Amazon!!) and ordered the large size.  He is delighted!  That makes me feel good too.  And the price was right!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> It holds well, last for a months (the bottle, not the hold), and has an added benefit of making your hair (if graying) darker!  However, I have noticed it looks darker when it is longer.</li>
    <li> Years ago it came in a clear glass container.  Every barber shop had it along with other brands, different colors on the shelf.  They would ask the customer what type of hair dressing he wanted.  If you were a regular, they knew.  It is still and excellent hair groom and an outstanding price.</li>
    <li> I came to read the reviews because I&#x27;m concerned about that &amp;#34;just gotta haircut&amp;#34; scent that I so remember.  I can&#x27;t find scentless wildroot anywhere.  Or, does anyone know any additive oils that can &#x27;customize&#x27; the scent?  Sometimes adding things destroys things, or at least changes the properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry hair and wildroot is the best option I think.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend who has used it for years and could no longer find it. He loves it, swears by it. He says it does not smell, it does not flake and holds hair in place but not sticky or stiff</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a new product for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about 65 years.&lt;br /&gt;A smaller bottle I obtained locally seemed to be diluted, but this is just like the originals.</li>
    <li> Great service, product arrived as stated</li>
    <li> Wildroot is Wildroot!  Looks like Wildrroot.  Feels like Wildroot.</li>
    <li> Hard to find locally.  It does a great job for those with flaky scalps and is not leave any oil residue.  Really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different from the previous one I bought: the former one I had was thicker and properly sealed while this one was kind of thinner or watery.  I don&#x27;t know which is the right one:  is it thicker because it is old stock?  Thinner because it&#x27;s a new stock?  What bothers me though was the cap of the bottle is wrapped by cellophane tape not sealed by a shrink wrap.</li>
    <li> Started using Wildroot in the 50&#x27;s.  It is the best hair product every made, in my opinion.  At age 83 my hair grows so fast using this product that I have to get a haircut more than once a month.  And like they said in the original ads &amp;#34;A Little Dab will do Yah&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Another product from &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; days for my husband.  He is happy again that there is still a product he can use from his younger years.</li>
    <li> my husband uses this exclusively and has for years.  service was great  intend to reorder as needed</li>
    <li> I used this product for years Delighted I&lt;br /&gt;found it again</li>
    <li> Hello! I bought this for my grandmother. She loves it. I&#x27;ve always used it for my hair, it&#x27;s great for my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> Product does everything advertised.  Works much better than what I previously used. Definitely well worth trying.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> Product was very old, had to mix with water. Dad was not happy at all. No Bueno!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wildroot Hair Groom for over 50 years and it has always been the same great product.  Not too thick, non-greasy, without alcohol, and easily absorbed into my hair(no too much left anymore though).  I use it after throughly wetting my hair.  It&#x27;s a five star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I just received a newly ordered bottle of \\&quot;Original Wildroot.\\&quot;  BEWARE - Evidently it&#x27;s not the same product as this one, \\&quot;Wildroot Original The Natural Looking Hair Groom.\\&quot;  It is much thicker, does not spread as easily, and the scent is different.  It&#x27;s easy to make the mistake as the packaging is identical.  However the names and UPC codes are different.  I would give the \\&quot;Original Wildroot,\\&quot; which is decidely NOT the original formula, only two or three stars.  Be careful as you shop around.</li>
    <li> nice product for dry scalp</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for something that will take the dryness out without looking oily&lt;br /&gt;this does a great job</li>
    <li> good service, good product</li>
    <li> For many years in the past I used this hair cream on a regular basis.  Then it went of the shelf and I had to use other products.  It really seems like the same old product.</li>
    <li> My husband just loves this hair groom. He has been using it for years. Very happy with the size and price. Delivery was very quick.</li>
    <li> This  was  sent  out a  while  ago. We are  completely  satisfied with  product</li>
    <li> The package was delivered as promise.</li>
    <li> As I started growing out my hair from a buzz cut I quickly realized hat I would need some kind of product to style it. I have used - and still use - the 5 classic products mentioned on the Art of Manliness blog: namely, Murray&#x27;s, Brylcreem, Groom and Clean, Vitalis, and Wildroot. Although all have their benefits, I prefer Wildroot as it isn&#x27;t as heavy and oily as Brylcreem, not as smelly as Groom &amp; Clean (although otherwise an excellent product), has more hold and sheen than Vitalis (although that stuff is great for casual occasions), and definitely way less greasy and easier to remove than Murray&#x27;s pomade. Overall, Wildroot has a very subtle smell that is hardly noticeable even before putting it in my hair and has just the right amount of hold and sheen without getting too heavy. Adding a light &#x27;coat&#x27; of Murray&#x27;s super light after using Wildroot can really give one a classic style and will still washout without having to whip out the dish detergent!</li>
    <li> My husband was thrilled to find wildroot again. Great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my father, who is 87 years old and has been using it for many, many years and cannot find it at local drugstores any  longer.  I am certain that he is happy with the product and I was very satisfied with the experience of ordering from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it is no longer available in local drugstores.  So happy to find a source for an old standby.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair training product. It holds well and lasts all day. It doesn&#x27;t smell, except for a brief faint whiff when applied. You can easily adjust its hold. A very small amount does the job. Put a dab in your palm and add a few drops of water to dilute it into a thinner mix, working it in your hands. Apply it to your hair. Comb or brush. Done.</li>
    <li> Really keeps the hair neat all day. I used it once before when my daughter was small and always kept her hair neat and smelling fresh as she went out the door for school</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it since I was a kid, I still do and I&#x27;m 83 years old.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband.  He is very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> should send back smell like rotten eggs.  not happy</li>
    <li> I am tired of hair gels and sprays and thought, Hey, my Dad used to use hair tonic to keep his hair neat. Sure he looked like a greaser from the 50&#x27;s, but boy his hair always looked good. I downloaded the &amp;#34;Old Time Radio&amp;#34; app for my phone awhle back and was listening to &amp;#34;Sam Spade, Private Detective&amp;#34; radio show from back in the 40&#x27;s. On that show, they advertised Wildroot Cream Oil Hair Tonic and on a lark I thought I&#x27;d look it up to see if it was still being made....and sure enough it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but when I got it, it came in a HUGE bottle (and for only 8 bucks). I immediately put a little in my hair and poof! no more need for gels or hair sprays.... and it made my hair very shiny. My daughter said my hair looked awesome! My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t tell how much to use, so I&#x27;m going to have to experiment more so I don&#x27;t put on too much or too little.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Its excellent will be buying from this seller again</li>
    <li> Ordered for for my father in law as it can&#x27;t be found here.  He has used this product for most of his 90 years.</li>
    <li> I know it is advertized as original but does not have same texture meaning it is far too thick!&lt;br /&gt;Useable, helps dry scalp. Debatable whether or not on repurchase!</li>
    <li> My barber used this on me once and then gave me a bottle to try and I ahve been hooked ever since  it is a good moisturizer and while I shave my scalp it keeps my head from drying out.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING WILDROOT FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS. iT IS NON-GREASEY BUT IT KEEPS MY HAIR IN PLACE. A LITTLE GOESS A LONG WAY</li>
