      <li>Great product!!</li>
      <li>Good value!</li>
      <li>Great to have for your Trimmer , for your Razor.</li>

      <li>Love them!!</li>
      <li>Good product ...</li>
      <li>Good price to pay.</li>
      <li>I use them every time after shaving and they work fine, and the packing was very good.</li>
      <li>The best one&#x27;s so far.</li>
      <li>They work as good as the original ones.  </li>
      <li>ok shipping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They were much better than the book I purchased thru AMAZON over a month ago that I was billed for but have yet to receive.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re the kind that came with the razor originally.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for brushes and was pleased to fine these.</li>
      <li>These arrived very quickly.  </li>
      <li>If 2 of these last me a year, I&#x27;ll be more than happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Precisely what we were looking for.</li>
      <li>These brushes are nowhere close to the size of my original Braun brush.</li>
      <li>I use them on my two Norelco&#x27;s but the original came apart.</li>
      <li>The brushes were for my husband to clean his electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>I do not use these to clean an electric razor, but to clean an airbrush gun.</li>
      <li>Clean like a brush should.  </li>
      <li>Simple design, good price, well built</li>
      <li>The prices is good, especially with Prime shipping.</li>
      <li>THe bushes were too small to be effective!!</li>
      <li>Started using right away and should hold up...</li>
      <li>The price is right</li>
      <li>The brushes clean very well.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it does exactly what I need it to, which is to clean out the hairs from my electrical Wahl head shaver.</li>
      <li>The brushes are equivalent to the originals and are very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>The supplier was first rate</li>
      <li>These brushes are a direct replacement for the original brushes.  </li>
      <li>My old one was taken by my wife to help a friend clean a smoking pipe.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand the smaller side works great and doesn&#x27;t shed nearly as much if at all.</li>
      <li>They will be very helpful cleaning my electric razor.</li>
      <li>They are cheap and can last if taken care of.</li>
      <li>These replacement brushes were came fast via USPS.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew what I was going to get, as I&#x27;ve had these before included with my older Norelco razors.</li>
      <li>these are not stiff enough to clean the razor after one use.</li>
      <li>but the bristles could be a little stiffer so that they cleaned better.  </li>
      <li>they are like an old broom you have used for 20 years.</li>
      <li>I used it once so far and no issues.</li>
      <li>Bristles stayed intact so far.</li>
      <li>If you have small hands and a delicate shaver to clean then you will fare better than I.</li>
      <li>Hard to fine some places, they have them for $.58</li>
      <li>not going to change the world,  but if you need small brushes to clean your razor</li>
      <li>They will not last long and for the price paid and shipping charged he was very displeased.  </li>
      <li>With both long bristles, and short/firm bristles, they are very useful for any cleaning/dusting of items with small crevices.&lt;br</li>

    <li> THe bushes were too small to be effective!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are lousy.  The bristles come out; the overall size is way too small; cleaning is not effective.  Do not order if you need a brush for a Braun.</li>

    <li> they are what they are</li>
    <li> These brushes didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought, difficult to keep a firm grasp. Also, the bristles are starting to fall out after only 2 months. Low quality.</li>
    <li> I have used cleaning brushes for 40+ years. these are not stiff enough to clean the razor after one use. they are like an old broom you have used for 20 years.</li>
    <li> I had bought these for my husband, and they were much smaller than I thought they would be.  He did not like them.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 of these brushes and with all of them the side with the larger hairs (left side on the picture) sheds and is of poor quality for anything other than cleaning your shaver. On the other hand the smaller side works great and doesn&#x27;t shed nearly as much if at all.</li>
    <li> Looked all over until I found them through Amazon. Brush that came with Wahl shaver worn out. These replacement brushes were came fast via USPS. Started using right away and should hold up...time will tell.  They do wear out after a few years but getting two should keep me from buying again for awhile.  Good price to pay.</li>
    <li> Great to have for your Trimmer , for your Razor.</li>
    <li> This razor brush is really very small. It is so small it is difficult to hold on to to use effectively. If you have small hands and a delicate shaver to clean then you will fare better than I.</li>
    <li> I do not use these to clean an electric razor, but to clean an airbrush gun. Unfortunately I lost my last brush and needed a new one. This a perfect replacement brush.</li>
    <li> These arrived very quickly.  They will be very helpful cleaning my electric razor.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as they last longer than others I have ordered which were supposedly the same, but they lasted only a couple weeks before fraying</li>
    <li> These brushes work well, and if you like you can trash them after each client.  They are cheap and can last if taken care of.</li>
    <li> I expected the brushes to be cheaper for that size and postage..</li>
    <li> Good product ... ok shipping.</li>
    <li> The best one&#x27;s so far. I use them on my two Norelco&#x27;s but the original came apart. Maybe my fault.</li>
    <li> Very little but if you have small fingers it works.</li>
    <li> I use them every time after shaving and they work fine, and the packing was very good. I recomend this merchant</li>
    <li> not going to change the world,  but if you need small brushes to clean your razor&lt;br /&gt;  ( or keyboard, or misc. hair trimmer, etc.)  these do the trick.</li>
    <li> Simple design, good price, well built</li>
    <li> Excellent, Thank You.</li>

    <li> Hard to fine some places, they have them for $.58 but you paid lot for postage. It a must item</li>

    <li> They&#x27;re the kind that came with the razor originally. They wear out over time. Working well.</li>
    <li> Hard to find product.  Good value!</li>
    <li> Works well removing hair from my clippers.  No problems after a few weeks and doesn&#x27;t fall apart after one use.</li>
    <li> Brushes are on a little soft for the purpose. I would also like to see them just a little bit bigger.</li>
    <li> They were good.&lt;br /&gt;They cost little and work great.&lt;br /&gt;They were much better than the book I purchased thru AMAZON over a month ago that I was billed for but have yet to receive.</li>
    <li> Precisely what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> both soft and stiff bristles to get all the bits of shavings out of my razor.  it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;.... recommend it.</li>
    <li> It did not hold up as long as it should have with a Panasonic electric shaver</li>
    <li> The brushes were for my husband to clean his electric shaver.  One of the two brushes already was falling apart with brush bristles in the bag.  They will not last long and for the price paid and shipping charged he was very displeased.  He thought he was getting quality but that was not the case.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for brushes and was pleased to fine these. The price is right but the bristles could be a little stiffer so that they cleaned better.  The supplier was first rate and I would buy from them again</li>
