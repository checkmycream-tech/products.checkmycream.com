      <li>/&gt;First of all, I was familiar with the fragrance already - so while I do love it - it does not factor in to my 5 star rating, although I smell great while typing this.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cologne!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re purchasing this fragrance, you&#x27;ve probably sampled it already (a beautifully take on the original Declaration EDT with spices and a prominent and smooth rose note that is quite alluring and will garner you many compliments) and wish to purchase it at a discount</li>
      <li>this cologne is so good and the smell is so unique .</li>
      <li>Good size bottle easy spray on have gotten very good reactions so far</li>

      <li>I just got my latest $100 bottle and received a sample of Declaration D&#x27;un Soir (this product), with my purchase.</li>
      <li>but this I like (more of a woody scent).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed overall</li>
      <li>and I told her how much I love Essence and that I was on the hunt for one for myself.  </li>
      <li>and I like it better</li>

      <li>The bottle is elegant with the exception of the spray stopper that seems a bit cheap.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied that it was the real thing!</li>
      <li>and this is a perfect variant if you feel them a little more</li>
      <li>Do not mistake this for the original Declaration which many feel smells like sweat and Indian food.</li>
      <li>Too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully sexy, fresh, sensual, and very unique.  </li>
      <li>Smells like a cheap corner store</li>
      <li>I tested it and it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have been using Cartier Declaration for a long time (in Red Box, 2005) and it is real good Cologne, one of a kind.</li>

      <li>Now I would like to put this stuff and share with everyone, thank you very much!</li>
      <li>The cologne is great the bottle sucked and the sprayer broke and half of the product</li>
      <li>Well, let me start by saying this is an excellent juice, why in terms of silage, projection, potency and how long it last, I will not grade it but</li>
      <li>THIS IS ONE OF THE LOVELY AND SOFT EDT</li>
      <li>Just smile and say thanx u..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As expected from Cartier, scent, longevity and elegance. With that being said I have to mention the great experience I have always had with Amazon. Buy it people wont regret it.</li>
    <li> nice smell, good for price</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. No debate.</li>
    <li> This is really a great smelling clogne.  I am a more citrus cologne guy but this I like (more of a woody scent).  The only thing I have an issue with is that it does not last as long as my other colognes (Nautica Blue/Voyage, etc.).</li>
    <li> Never had this never smelled it, but took a chance and smells awesome</li>
    <li> I originally did not like this EdT when sprayed on paper at the Nordstrom counter.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I received a sample from the sales associate.&lt;br /&gt;After a few sprayings, I came to love it and ordered a full bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It is a fresh, spicy masculine rose and pepper oriented fragrance that is slightly synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;All of this may sound strange, but in production, it is very seductive and wearable.&lt;br /&gt;During the dry-down, this fragrance is suitable for every-day wear and I have worn it to church and to work.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a terriffic night scent, however.</li>
    <li> Smells like bitterness and roses, gets a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I was worried b/c the price was so much better than anywhere else but they did not disappoint!  Received quickly.  Perfect, shiny package.  Saved a lot of $$$.  This is my go to place!!</li>
    <li> OMG so i wasnt big on cologne until my trip to vegas when i went into Dillard&#x27;s and my sister boyfriend introduced me to this cologne, so i got a sample of it, wore it out and man when i tell you a lot of people was loving it they was loving it!! It last all day and even into the next day! At Macy&#x27;s it was very costly 105$ but amazon has it for cheaper and the packaging was nice and it seriously came in one piece! The cologne smelled really good and i plan on buying another bottle!</li>
    <li> This one will definitely have the women coming around at work more than they use too. It&#x27;s a real go get them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 08/01/13&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the one who goes around telling people what cologne I&#x27;m wearing but like I said before \\&quot;This cologne speaks for it self.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve had guys asking me all the time \\&quot;what the hell are you wearing man.\\&quot; And the ladies always what to hug you just one more time!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE THE DECLARATION NEVER HAD THE D&#x27;UN SOIR..THIS IS ONE OF THE LOVELY AND SOFT EDT THAT I HAD THE PLESURE TO USE.FIRST TONE OF FLOWER,MID TONE OF WOODS AND SPYCES THEN RETURN TO THE FISRT TONE OF FLOWER..THIS IS MAGICAL..&lt;br /&gt;STAY FOR A LOONG TIME,TO BE USE AT NIGHT.I WOUNDER ABOUT THE DECLARATION EDP IT MAY BE !EXELENTE!</li>
    <li> Very unique and good.  Do not mistake this for the original Declaration which many feel smells like sweat and Indian food. It kinda does.  This is much different and has a light floral peppery scent with a touch of woods.  I do not like floral smells but this is very well done.</li>
    <li> I love this cartier declaration! women crazy with its exquisite aroma,&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent perfume for cuarquier equipment, this product is genuine and comes very fast shipping I recommend 1000 * 1000</li>
    <li> Nice crisp smell for mostly evening wear...but does not last. The samples lasts longer because it&#x27;s not watered down, it&#x27;s concentrated so you&#x27;ll buy the big bottle. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good for about a half an hour or so.</li>
    <li> The scent does not pair well with my body chemistry.  It has a peppery scent that reminds me of D&amp;G which I did not care for either.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance.Very fresh, long lasting. Too feminine for me  but I still like it . I just purchased Cartier Roadster sport and I like it better</li>
    <li> My wife says she does not like the smell. I was disappointed with the fact she does not like it because of all the comments about how people love the smell and ask what others are wearing. I know it depends on the person...</li>
    <li> So i just got my bottle.. Fully in tack and wrapped in cellophane.. Perfume world is the best.. I stay in so cal and it shipz from new jersey and i still received my cologne in 2 dayz..  @ standard shipping.. Great customer service every time.. Now about the fragrance... What more can i say.. Itz raw seduction all bottled up... I guarantee u will have women approaching you.. Itz that seductive.. No need to say anything.. Just smile and say thanx u.. Very clean but semi spicy aroma.. You have to smell it to believe it;)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is the actual product or a knockoff, but it smells extremely similar to the real product and very tough to tell the difference if any difference at all.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments every time I&#x27;ve ever worn it. So Kudos, deserves 5 stars.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife choose this for me, when i get it was a Good choice and the price was great.  I will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Very lite scent that is better for summer usage. The bottle is elegant with the exception of the spray stopper that seems a bit cheap.</li>
    <li> No where close to what that the store version smells like. Too strong.</li>
    <li> Oh man, what a cologne! I have owned quite a few in my lifetime, but this one is just so unique compared to the ones I owned. I owned 212, Gucci Guilty Intense, D&amp;G the one sport, YSL L&#x27;Homme De Libre... This one has that unique note, that rose, that just stands out. It gives you a floral, but cool vibe. What I mean by that is that you get a nice rose scent for a good couple of hours, but after the few hours, when it begins to dry down, you get sort of that classic dry down. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it just smells and feels good on my skin. You&#x27;ll understand if you give it a try. I own Pasha from Cartier and find it to be a gem. And this one I can say the same to as well. This is definitely going into my gem collection!</li>
    <li> I have bought this cologne at a store for 108$. It smells amazing, the cologne itself deserves an A+. However, the cologne that I received from Amazon cannot be compared to the one that I bought in store.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first review, and I&#x27;m only doing it because i love this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I will soon get a replacement, so I will update this review if the replacement turns out to be better.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a faulty bottle, so we will see how the other one turns out to be. Again, the cologne is amazing, but the one I received is not the same as the original one that i paid full retail price.</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample from Sephora of this product and fell in love with the scent. Unfortunately, the price was too good to be true. The smell of this spray is not the same as the real deal you can buy in stores. I&#x27;m extremely dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and I love the scent.  And amazingly he does, too! We have been married for 34 years and I think this is the first time we have both agreed on his cologne.  Usually I buy something and it sits unused on the counter.  But he actually will wear this! The scent is NOT overpowering but you are pleasantly aware of it and it lasts all day. I will purchase the shower gel for him as well!</li>
    <li> Perfect for a gift purchase</li>
    <li> I give to you 5 starts because you deserve  it. that experience with you was really great I am very happy to have business with you once again thank you and keep doing like that.</li>
    <li> Well, let me start by saying this is an excellent juice, why in terms of silage, projection, potency and how long it last, I will not grade it but what i can tell you is that this is meant to be in the same category as the niche perfumes why?&lt;br /&gt;I spray a new york oud by bond 9 and cartier declaration d&#x27;un soir the same amount on both my body and cloth, what a great mix but I tell you cartier d&#x27;un soir did suppress new your oud  all day, they both lasted long but i am still smelling cartier after 24 hrs of application, whiffs on my skin and my cloth as if I just sprayed it.&lt;br /&gt;wow.</li>
    <li> As expected from Cartier, scent, longevity and elegance. With that being said I have to mention the great experience I have always had with Amazon. Buy it people wont regret it.</li>
    <li> The cologne is great the bottle sucked and the sprayer broke and half of the product evaporated-- love the scent hate the bottle - go figure?</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical to buy the cologne from the internet but I received a real Cartier D&#x27;un Soir EDT. I tested it and it is fantastic. I have been using Cartier Declaration for a long time (in Red Box, 2005) and it is real good Cologne, one of a kind. I just got The Cartier Declaration D&#x27;un Soir EDT for Men (2013) directly from Amazon. It is little different cologne which has fresh woody scent cocktail with touch of sandalwood and rose. I like the smell and it lasts for a long time but after three hours it wears out a bit and have soft smell.</li>
    <li> I am happy wity the ptoduct and the way it was delivered but I had expected to receive some samples with it. One less star for that.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I love this cologne</li>
    <li> This one sells at $105 at Nordstorm and other retail places. This is the new one from Cartier and is great if you love the designer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the declaration and the essence quite a lot and this is a perfect variant if you feel them a little more citrussy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, the description said that the product is a tester and I was expecting an open box, but surprisingly, I got a fully packed new box - more than happy!</li>
    <li> Excellent , fresh during the day and smells special at night</li>
    <li> Wow I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much this smells like old lady, way too powerful, FLOWER PERFUME!  It is amazing to me that it is listed as a mens cologne.  I don&#x27;t think even women should wear it is so flowery.  I wore this to work (yeah, yeah, yuk it up!) and I could not get it off fast enough.  I tried to wash it off 3 times with soap, no dice, it was in my shirt.  The guys, and girls all were laughing at me (with a sympathetic laugh at least) for wearing a woman&#x27;s perfume, and an OLD woman&#x27;s perfume at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible, overpowering, Flowers!</li>
    <li> I gave it to my boyfriend. It&#x27;s so chic and sophisticated. I really loved it. Because its long lasting longevity and heavy sillage, it&#x27;s better to night use or cold days. Very perceptible pepper spray top note.</li>
    <li> excellent love it thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this! i always buy it for my fiance the smell is so good! best quality and everything the seller tells you is true. plus its way cheaper than in the stores and its the real brand.</li>
    <li> One of my favourite perfume as it is well known brand and nice smelling</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this scent</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I actually bought this product for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Christmas I wandered into Nordstroms looking for a nice cologne for my husband.  I tend to be pretty picky when it comes to cologne and have only smelled a few that I really like.  The attendant introduced me to Cartier Declaration Essence and I swooned.  The main notes of Cardamom reminded me of the exotics of the Middle East, a place I have a real passion for.  Every time he wears it, I have to stop and take in a big whiff, it&#x27;s just to die for.  It is my most favorite and coveted fragrance of all.  Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much that I contemplated on buying it for myself.  Women&#x27;s perfume is often too feminine and the notes too sweet or too flowery for my sensitive pallet.  Lucky for me, the same attendant that helped me two Christmas&#x27; ago was there again today and I told her how much I love Essence and that I was on the hunt for one for myself.  I don&#x27;t want to smell just like my husband, or wear the same thing, but I wanted something I could get away with that had the same elements of Cardamom present.  Declaration D&#x27;un Soir is a perfect fit, a fresher take on the deeper Essence.  It&#x27;s got the same spiciness as Essence but with a lighter touch that is just feminine enough to bridge the gender gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is now my second favorite (Essence still being my first).  It&#x27;s wonderfully sexy, fresh, sensual, and very unique.  In my opinion, Cartier carries the best cologne offered.</li>
    <li> Early birthday gift for my guy and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Love the packaging and design of the bottle, too.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> I received my purchase today, and was surprised to see that I had received the full retail packaging, wrapped and sealed.  If you&#x27;re purchasing this fragrance, you&#x27;ve probably sampled it already (a beautifully take on the original Declaration EDT with spices and a prominent and smooth rose note that is quite alluring and will garner you many compliments) and wish to purchase it at a discount and Amazon is the place to do it.  As another reviewer has mentioned, if you walk into any department store that carries Cartier fragrances, this 3.3 ounce bottle will cost you $105 with taxes.  Buy it here for less than half the price and free shipping.  Amazing, great job on this one Amazon!</li>
    <li> 5 stars explained:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I was familiar with the fragrance already - so while I do love it - it does not factor in to my 5 star rating, although I smell great while typing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Cartier&#x27;s Declaration has always been my go-to cologne (or eau de toilette), and for years, I&#x27;ve watched the price go up. $60...to $80...to now, around $100 for the 3.3 oz bottle. And that&#x27;s not including tax or shipping! I mean you&#x27;re buying 3.3oz of a liquid that smells good @ $30/ounce! Insane! Anyway... I just got my latest $100 bottle and received a sample of Declaration D&#x27;un Soir (this product), with my purchase. I threw the sample in my travel case, and tried it out on a recent trip. I loved it. I wanted it. But there was no way I was about to shell out another $100 for cologne right away. Forget the smaller 1.6oz bottle for $75. Paying $47/ounce is NOT an option. So what do I do? Obviously I check amazon.com, where you can buy anything, to see if there&#x27;s a deal. Low and behold, I found this, labeled as a &amp;#34;TESTER&amp;#34; bottle for $54. I figure I&#x27;ll give it a shot, because I can&#x27;t imagine them sending a half-empty or totally disgusting bottle (in which case this would get NO STARS!!), and I was right. Not only was the bottle completely full and clean, it was BRAND NEW in a SEALED PACKAGE exactly as it would be new at Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So given that amazon.com has FAR EXCEEDED my expectations, I will look to buy 100% of my fragrances here going forward. I could not be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Interesting smell, and very unique. Not the best cologne I have, but not bad at all.</li>
    <li> This thing I was looking for very long, finally found, after receiving the feeling is very good, I like it very much! Now I would like to put this stuff and share with everyone, thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really write reviews but wanted to warn any and all that this product smells nothing like the actual cologne. Smells like a cheap corner store knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not even decent enough to wear despite it not being the same one.</li>
    <li> I tore out the article which said the product has %%-notes of cardamom and also sandalwood somewhere in the mix, and pepper among other things. To me it has a somewhat elusive- and non-aggressiveness, not sweet or sporty though. Good all around and the bottle isnt tiny either. Which may or may not hinder travel (bottle design has a plastic lock mechanism), but it is generous of Cartier.  I&#x27;m impressed overall and perhaps it could just be my particular skin chemistry too. That&#x27;s always in the disclaimers.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cologne that&#x27;s difficult, for whatever reason, to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sophisticated and non-intrusive scent.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice.</li>
    <li> This product is a rip off, I have used this product for yrs and this spay is just fake dont buy it PLEASE</li>
    <li> this cologne is so good and the smell is so unique . I love it and it&#x27;s one of the best cologne I ever bought in my life.</li>
    <li> Clean fresh scent not overpowering and long lasting. Good size bottle easy spray on have gotten very good reactions so far</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cologne!</li>
    <li> I must inform my disappointment in the quality of the perfume purchased from you, besides the quality of the material of the bottle, the safety part was broken to remove it, plus the perfume only maintains the essence for a short time, unlike perfumes buy at Macys, which are set around a full day. I have noticed a large peaking in the quality of their perfumes, thanks.</li>
    <li> It did Not meet my expectations. It smells horrible. I immediately discontinued use of it and have it away.</li>
    <li> To my nose, this is really awful. I have the Declaration Essence and Declaration and those are good (though not my favs). This smells nothing like those. Of the Declaration family, I&#x27;d chose the Declaration Essence. Note: All of them have a sort of sage note, which can smell either great or kind of stinky. D&#x27;un Soir basically takes all the bad elements and leaves out the good. I couldn&#x27;t give it away.</li>
    <li> the real thing. Highly recommended, long lasting unique essence.</li>
    <li> Great product, price is amazing and delivered on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Simply Cartier! Notwithstanding, Amazon was perfect.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. Very satisfied that it was the real thing! Once again amazon lives up to expectations! Thank you!</li>
