      <li>And finally, as a person who scratches their head seemingly all the time, the anti-itch qualities are awesome!</li>

      <li>Wow, these products are really great.</li>
      <li>Wow is this stuff great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo &amp; conditioner for a while now that could take the frizz out of my ultra fine and thinning hair.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I have noticed a huge difference in how our hair feels after using it.  </li>
      <li>So I look for something that will smooth my hair.</li>
      <li>And it has no annoying fragrance.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for my hair hope it will do the same for yours.</li>
      <li>it really helps itch and dandruff, the packaging is simple and does not have the organic stamp, however, the product is organic and excellent</li>
      <li>As a hairstylist, I&#x27;ve worked with many products and Scrumptious is right up there.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much to get the job done and it rinses easily!</li>
      <li>Love that my hair feels soft.</li>
      <li>Normally I get some products that make my hair look good as well as being manageable--but inevitable</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It put the moisture back in and my curls were bouncy and frizz free!</li>
      <li>and I am sure in better condition than it was using products that strip my color and are hard on my hair.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>It really helps with the itching.</li>
      <li>The shampoo really does reduce any itch and makes my hair feel thicker and healthier.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo was gentle and the conditioner luxurious.</li>
      <li>First off, the shampoo and conditioner are all natural -- that&#x27;s a must.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I must admit I wasn&#x27;t going to try this new product because I like the products I use</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t want or need new hair care products.</li>
      <li>The big names did a better job than the cheaper brands but in time started to weigh my hair down, I could feel the build up over time.</li>
      <li>I thought I would try the shampoo and conditioner and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>So far with Scrumptious Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>We both have natural wave</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After using this product I have definitely notice a difference.  My scalp is calmer &amp; the itching is less &amp; less frequent</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product.  My daughter and I have noticed a huge difference in how our hair feels after using it.  We both have natural wave and this makes my curls much softer and less frizzy.  She straightens her hair and loves how it feels.  Highly recommend.  Only wish I could buy it in bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is not as thick as most shampoos, but it works.  I use both the shampoo and the conditioner and my hair looks great and is easy to style.  And, I was amazed that my scalp did not itch for several days - until I washed my hair again.  My hair is streaked so I do not wash it every day.  I have tried all kinds of anti-itch shampoos and this one works the best.</li>
    <li> Wow is this stuff great.  What a difference it has made to my hair.  Looks good and feels good.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> it really helps itch and dandruff, the packaging is simple and does not have the organic stamp, however, the product is organic and excellent</li>
    <li> The shampoo really does reduce any itch and makes my hair feel thicker and healthier.  And it has no annoying fragrance.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Great experience with seller too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft, silky, shiny.  Shampoo leaves hair dry, so you do need the conditioner. The conditioner is thick and hard to rinse out of hair and off of the shower. The product did not help my itchy scalp. Very small bottles of product for the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  What a relief.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on products I&#x27;ve purchased, but I must say - I really like this shampoo and conditioner! I don&#x27;t need to use much to get the job done and it rinses easily! No perfume smell!!!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and it is not oily. I wash my hair about every 4 days. So I look for something that will smooth my hair. Love that my hair feels soft. I am waiting to see if it handles my itchy scalp after I get my color done, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> It really helps with the itching. I just wish the shampoo was more sudsy. But I love the conditioner. I probably will not buy the shampoo again buy will definitely repurchase the conditioner!</li>
    <li> Very good!  I recommend those product. Thanks! Amazon!</li>
    <li> Had to try this out as soon as I received it in the mail .  . . the description of the product is totally spot on.  My hair feels fuller and I do appreciate the naturalness of the product.  My husband is loving this as well.</li>
    <li> Ordered my Itchy Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner about a week ago.  I must admit I wasn&#x27;t going to try this new product because I like the products I use and I didn&#x27;t want or need new hair care products. However, when I learned that Beverly Hills Health and Beauty Products was behind the New Hair Care, I thought I would give it a try. I have tried many of their products and absolutely love them so I thought why not  give it a try. So I tried the products on my hair. I have thick, long, course hair that I color on a regular basis, I was a little skeptical  that these product that were organic, antibacterial, and free of parabens and sulfate, were  going to do for my hair what my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner does. I HATE BEING WRONG! They are amazing. My hair looks great, feels great and I am sure in better condition than it was using products that strip my color and are hard on my hair. My scalp does not itch anymore.  Maybe all the chemicals in my other shampoo and conditioner was the cause of the itch! With summer coming and all the chlorine in pools, salt in the ocean and the sun on my hair, these are just a few reasons I have switched hair care products. Many things can make my scalp itch, but not anymore!!</li>
    <li> Great product! After a long winter, my scalp was dry and itchy. The shampoo was gentle and the conditioner luxurious. It put the moisture back in and my curls were bouncy and frizz free! As a hairstylist, I&#x27;ve worked with many products and Scrumptious is right up there. Thank you!</li>
    <li> First off, the shampoo and conditioner are all natural -- that&#x27;s a must.  Secondly, there is no fragrance -- that is also a must.  And finally, as a person who scratches their head seemingly all the time, the anti-itch qualities are awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo &amp; conditioner for a while now that could take the frizz out of my ultra fine and thinning hair. I Always wait to write my reviews after using a product for a little while because I usually like it in the beginning and as time goes on it looses it&#x27;s luster. That is not the case with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and it&#x27;s only gotten better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Scrumptious itch cream and was very pleased with it so when Beverly Hills Health &amp; Beauty offered the shampoo &amp; conditioner I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m very glad I did. I&#x27;ve never had a product that has worked so well on my hair and I&#x27;ve tried everything from the cheaper brands to the big name brands with varying results. The big names did a better job than the cheaper brands but in time started to weigh my hair down, I could feel the build up over time. So far with Scrumptious Shampoo &amp; Conditioner my hair is getting better, healthier and more manageable with each use... I have every reason to believe this trend will continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for my hair hope it will do the same for yours.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of skin issues and I use their Itch Relief cream on a regular basis.  I thought I would try the shampoo and conditioner and was pleasantly surprised.  My hair basically behaved like my regular shampoo and conditioner only as an added bonus it reduces my itching.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wow, these products are really great. I have oily skin and dry hair, and finding a great shampoo and conditioner is difficult. Normally I get some products that make my hair look good as well as being manageable--but inevitable my scalp will itch! There is always an itch! No dandruff, just a mild and annoying itch. Well--no itch with Scrumptious, and I am thrilled about that! These products leave my hair looking great and my scalp feeling wonderful! Very pleased. :-)</li>
