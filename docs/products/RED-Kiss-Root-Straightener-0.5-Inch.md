      <li>I love how it really works and</li>
      <li>I Love the product works very well</li>
      <li>You should have to pass it through your hair once or twice the most to get straight results and that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
      <li>Its not a bad price for the item.</li>
      <li>my hair is soo straight!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for those few weeks between perms when the new growth is coming in.</li>
      <li>This product is cheaper than the edge stick which makes it worth the buy</li>
      <li>The product was okay, I felt heat when using this product, more heat then expected.</li>
      <li>I read prior reviews about the Kiss Ceramic Root Straightener, and I wanted to purchase one of my own.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to get super hot, but it gets the job done for my hair</li>
      <li>This arrived super fast!</li>
      <li>get right too the roots without burning.</li>
      <li>I love it and will be shopping for more hair products in the near future</li>
      <li>I actually like this product because it does what its says its really good on edges if you are natural!</li>
      <li>My hair was straight to the roots and soft with a very smooth feel.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what its suppose to.</li>
      <li>I rather buy a hot comb</li>
      <li>I think I had higher expectations, however it does work.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot as it should be.</li>
      <li>It gets hot</li>
      <li>, it did not tame her hair, and the flat iron works SO MUCH BETTER!</li>
      <li>The seller shipped quickly and the packaging was brand new.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it, wanted to purchase one a long time ago, but the price was too high, so I was amazed when I found this one at just the right price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to use and straightens hair almost down to the scalp without burning.</li>
      <li>I use it on highest setting with pressing oil my roots get truly straight.</li>
      <li>It wont get them bone straight</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get the edges as it should.</li>
      <li>My roots reverted in a matter of an hour, and that&#x27;s on a high setting!</li>
      <li>expected it to straighten hair better than it did.</li>
      <li>My hair and roots stayed straight for 3 weeks</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t really grab those edges.</li>
      <li>This product really does not burn.</li>
      <li>If you really want it to work, you have to use it at the highest heat level, which is 450 degree.</li>
      <li>Keeps my edges perfectly straight.</li>
      <li>I expected more from this product.</li>
      <li>BUT my friend knew I really wanted it</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>heats fast</li>
      <li>;  I liked it for our edges but the small size made it hard to do our whole head because the parts had to be small to get the best results.  </li>
      <li>and it does a decent job.</li>
      <li>I am now able to straighten my 3 girls hair without them jumping from the heat of a regular flat iron.  </li>
      <li>i feel the combs on both sides could be a little better</li>
      <li>one think i dont like about the product is i would like to see the combs a little more defined(although</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go totally natural, but didn&#x27;t really want to put chemicals in my hair again for a while.</li>
      <li>Even the tiny curly gray hair along the edges smoothed right out.</li>
      <li>Though my new growth and relaxed hair were detangled, strands were coming out with each pass.</li>
      <li>I was convinced that this would work, considering I&#x27;ve used curling iron barrels to whip new growth into shape for years with ease.  </li>
      <li>But could have just spent the extra money to get a better one.</li>
      <li>I never set irons of any kind on a high setting but with these I did &amp; after a few tries I realized I just waisted my money.  </li>
      <li>I have natural, very coarse hair that was blown straight at a salon.  </li>
      <li>My 8 year old has</li>

    <li> Both my daughter and I love this product</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot as it should be. Overall it does get the edges straight</li>
    <li> This product really does not burn.</li>
    <li> am African American with med coarse hair. I like it, it&#x27;s easy to use and fun. It gets hot I use it on highest setting with pressing oil my roots get truly straight. I don&#x27;t get burnt I can get close to edges. My hair and roots stayed straight for 3 weeks I would wrap my hair up every night it&#x27;s my new hair secret.</li>
    <li> expected it to straighten hair better than it did.</li>
    <li> Okay so I&#x27;m &amp;#34;short hair don&#x27;t care&amp;#34; all day and this savior right here!!!!!!!  I normally can&#x27;t wait for my 6 week relaxer because my roots are crazy and thick - which can cause relaxing too soon etc.....Well this has definitely saved my hair and scalp, now I can hold out for 6+ weeks.  It gets my roots nice and straight and it also gets very hot!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived broken had to return</li>
    <li> Love the results I get from it.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old has long, thick 4a hair and is extremely tender-headed. She said &amp;#34;I love it!&amp;#34; I asked her why and she said that she did not &amp;#34;feel any burning, not even a little bit!&amp;#34;  I liked it for our edges but the small size made it hard to do our whole head because the parts had to be small to get the best results.  If your hair is longer, you&#x27;ll be happier with a bigger one.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item back in late May 2015. It&#x27;s now the beginning of August and the teeth are coming apart. This product was lightly used maybe 2 ~ 3 times a week for light touching up. The is no way to get a hold of the seller. Avoid purchasing this product. Here&#x27;s photo of the teeth missing.    [...]</li>
    <li> Prefer using Ceramic Root Styler.</li>
    <li> I read prior reviews about the Kiss Ceramic Root Straightener, and I wanted to purchase one of my own. I&#x27;m very pleased with the root straightener and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter, She is 13 years old, wears her hair natural and has about 3C thick curly frizzy hair. I bought this product to save time for touch ups and such and thinking it would be quicker than using the flat iron. NOPE! What a waste of time!, it did not tame her hair, and the flat iron works SO MUCH BETTER! I have decided to try and get my money back, well of course this was bought out of a beauty store ( no money back there) so I had no choice but to contact Red Kiss, it has been 4 days and no response! I guess I am at a $30 dollar loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a tool to tame edges, just buy the 1/2 inch flat iron. That is what I have decided to do! And I have learned to shop Ulta &amp; or Sally&#x27;s when purchasing equipment, at least they honor their integrity by refunding when a customer is not satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDate 10/21/2013_ Red Kiss finally contacted me and will not refund! People, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CHEAP PRODUCT!!! I am out of $30, PISSED!</li>
    <li> When I received the item it was broken inside the box so I sent it back to the manufactured don&#x27;t want another one.</li>
    <li> This arrived super fast! Great product.</li>
    <li> I would have liked it to get closer but since I don&#x27;t burn myself for as close as I do get im all smiles.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really grab those edges.</li>
    <li> Just cut my hair short to get all the chemically damaged part off. I didn&#x27;t want to go totally natural, but didn&#x27;t really want to put chemicals in my hair again for a while. Got this tool and basically laid it down on my hair and combed it thru. Surprise!!!  My hair was straight to the roots and soft with a very smooth feel. The teeth protected my scalp from any burns, even on the very short hair along the back of my neck. I&#x27;m a little older now and the gray has started creeping in, but no problem. Even the tiny curly gray hair along the edges smoothed right out. Since gray hair tends to be more fragile this is a great option for me. No more chemicals!!! At least, no time soon.</li>
    <li> It is true you can get close to the scalp and my hair is easier to comb, it not good a straightening the hair</li>
    <li> It did not work for me and did not like how it work. I am sending it back to you. Thanks</li>
    <li> The root straighter is okay.  Not exactly what I expected but it does help with straightening the edges some.  You need to make a couple of passes before it actually straightens.</li>
    <li> This is not something I use often. I think I had higher expectations, however it does work. I think it&#x27;s the comb that surrounds the barrel. The teeth are too fine. The seller shipped quickly and the packaging was brand new.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the cords and the shortness of the comb I rather buy a hot comb sorry do not like it</li>
    <li> If you really want it to work, you have to use it at the highest heat level, which is 450 degree.</li>
    <li> I tried this edge stick and I love it.it heats fast and it did a great job on my roots too.</li>
    <li> I pItrchased this item for the purpose of straightening edges. It works really fine and it does not burn your scalp while placing directly at the root.  I think this was a wonderful purchase because it serves the purpose for a great price and also the delivery was right on time!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it, wanted to purchase one a long time ago, but the price was too high, so I was amazed when I found this one at just the right price. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase.  It functions as advertised. Easy to use, adds the finishing touch to my hairstyles.  I have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan, doesn&#x27;t get my roots straight still have to use the flat irons.</li>
    <li> get right too the roots without burning.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  Perfect for the edges in between relaxers!  Arrived very quickly, and in great condition.  Heats up so quickly and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! It&#x27;s perfect for those few weeks between perms when the new growth is coming in. It&#x27;s also very easy to use and straightens hair almost down to the scalp without burning.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> It works. But correct technique is mandatory. Works best with pressing oil and you must smooth first, or your hair will get caught in the teeth. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get super hot, but it gets the job done for my hair</li>
    <li> The idea is excellent, the execution leaves much to be desired. I bought 2 so that I wouldn&#x27;t blow a gasket waiting for the comb to heat up again. After several uses the gold paint peeled off of the mystery metal heating core. I agree with other reviewers of this and similar root straighteners, you can loose a lot of hair through the narrowly spaced teeth, so I ordered the 1 inch model. It arrived in pieces, the handle was split along the seams, the wires protruding from the proximal end of the handle, separate from the wire that attaches the cord to the heating mechanism. The silver painted plastic label was free floating in the box. The company gave me the run around about damage in shipping etc. But- the packaging was pristine, not a dent in plastic or cardboard. It was the comb that exhibited poor manufacturing.  After a series of emails, they agreed to send a return label. Who has the original box after weeks of use? I usually throw them out when I see that what I ordered is what is in the box. Having had 3 before this one I expected this one to work, if even for a short time. So I am in search of an edge/root straightener that achieves and maintains the 450 degrees I need to tackle my very coarse, thick AA hair and is actually made of the materials advertised. Ceramic? I don&#x27;t think so- tin, aluminum, scrap metal I believe but this one is nothing like the HANA elite, a 100% ceramic flat iron, the best on the market IMHO. Wish they made an edge comb.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t purchase Red root control combs unless you are prepared for planned obsolescence, they now you&#x27;ll be back for another in a month or so because that&#x27;s about their lifespan and there aren&#x27;t any competitors.</li>
    <li> I have natural, very coarse hair that was blown straight at a salon.  I got this to keep up with my \\&quot;edges.\\&quot; So far, I love it! Keeps my edges perfectly straight. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like it but it more for longer hair</li>
    <li> Does exactly what its suppose to.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have thick hair and I use it to straighten all my roots, not just my edges and it does a decent job.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected. My new growth reverted back not long after I finished each section. I used ors heat protectant and after I received pressing oil in the mail, I used that thinking it would make a difference. My hair reverted back faster when I used the pressing oil. Though my new growth and relaxed hair were detangled, strands were coming out with each pass. Both textures are thick so I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with that. I use the chase method from time to time, so the small teeth of the comb wasn&#x27;t the issue, nor is the heat setting. I was convinced that this would work, considering I&#x27;ve used curling iron barrels to whip new growth into shape for years with ease.  Very disappointing...This will collect dust in a corner of my house until I throw it out or start wearing wigs and use it to straighten it out.</li>
    <li> I Love the product works very well</li>
    <li> I actually like this product because it does what its says its really good on edges if you are natural! It wont get them bone straight but it will loose the curl the higher temp you go. one think i dont like about the product is i would like to see the combs a little more defined(although this comes in many sizes) i feel the combs on both sides could be a little better you do have to be care ful because it is not immposible to burn yourself with this tool which reaches up to 450 degrees. This product is cheaper than the edge stick which makes it worth the buy i would recommend any natural or relaxed to buy to have as a assistant tool to reach those places the flat iron cant or shouldnt go!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It does do what I need it to do. It&#x27;s just enough heat to get the job done.</li>
    <li> The product does not work!! My roots reverted in a matter of an hour, and that&#x27;s on a high setting! Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
    <li> Does not work well for me; hopefully for someone else.</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t straighten my roots to my liking, without me having to run it through my hair multiple times and that&#x27;s not good for me. That seems like a lot of heat damage. You should have to pass it through your hair once or twice the most to get straight results and that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, it works for two - three day. Its not a bad price for the item. I wouldn&#x27;t pay over $40.00 for this item.</li>
    <li> i wanted to try this product because i wanted to be able to straighten my daughters edges without hurting her. the comb does get a little hot but the middle does not get hot enough to complete the job.</li>
    <li> Great concept if they did as claimed.  I never set irons of any kind on a high setting but with these I did &amp; after a few tries I realized I just waisted my money.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - at least on this brand!</li>
    <li> Its an amazing product. I used it on myself first to make sure i wouldn&#x27;t get burned and I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The product was okay, I felt heat when using this product, more heat then expected. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product is not effective on the tightest natural curl patterns.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive it and was issued a refund with no hesitation and great customer service from amazon... BUT my friend knew I really wanted it so she ordered it for me as an surprise AND I LOVE IT!!! I am now able to straighten my 3 girls hair without them jumping from the heat of a regular flat iron.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT and it&#x27;s great for your children!!!!</li>
    <li> It works but pulls your hair out as the comb is hard, gets hot as it should. But could have just spent the extra money to get a better one. Doesn&#x27;t really get the edges as it should. The ones which cost 80 work a lot better....so I guess you pay for what you get! I have it someone and brought a better one &amp; skin one!</li>
    <li> This product is the best!! I love how it really works and my hair is soo straight!! I love it and will be shopping for more hair products in the near future</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected butgets the job done!</li>
    <li> Was excited to try this...doesn&#x27;t work as well as I imagined it would.  wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> It takes longer than I expected to show results. I expected more from this product. I bought the straightener for my teenage daughters, however, we won&#x27;t get much out of it.</li>
