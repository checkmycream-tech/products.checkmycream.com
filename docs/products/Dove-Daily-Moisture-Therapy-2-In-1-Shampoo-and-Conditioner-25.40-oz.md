### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome!  </li>
      <li>Best shampoo I have every used.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair beautiful</li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s covered in dandruff also, told me she&#x27;d been using my Dove because it smelled so good.  </li>
      <li>and it does almost as equally good job</li>
      <li>Not as good as the ones that have the shampoo and conditioner separate but is recommended nonetheless.</li>
      <li>The product was shipped in good condition</li>
      <li>As what I have written in title, this is what I think best one of the cheap choices.</li>
      <li>this shampoo/conditioner  is great for my hair  after using this shampoo  my hair feels clean  </li>
      <li>Very gentle and yet, a very effective cleanser for the hair and</li>
      <li>I love that their shampoo + conditioner isn&#x27;t just another shampoo.</li>
      <li>I am highly satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>I love all the Dove products.</li>
      <li>the smell is refreshing and not over powering like others...</li>
      <li>do still love my Dove Bar soap.  </li>
      <li>really enjoyed using this shampoo, though.</li>
      <li>Nobody else on the reviews is mentioning this, so I thought I&#x27;d better say something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The 2-in-1 was AMAZING - to get my hair clean and 3/4 conditioned in one step?  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t over-condition fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Not the best shampoo - felt it was too heavy on the conditioning  part.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want spend much on shampoo, I think that is a nice choice.</li>
      <li>The smell is always great, although sometimes different.</li>
      <li>I have tried all sorts of brands, many require using a lot of shampoo, making them very uneconomical...</li>
      <li>Not bad if you&#x27;re looking for convenience in the shower.</li>
      <li>it works good, there&#x27;s better but this is good for the price, frieda products have a slight edge, pantene,  and sassoon, but its still a personal thing</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal user of Dove&#x27;s hair products for over 10 years.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice and does not dry out my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dove for 5 years now and my hair is always soft, light, fragrant, and smooth.</li>
      <li>I like what it does for my hair and will order more in the future.</li>
      <li>They were a revelation for my medium-ish texture, wavy, and tangle-prone hair when I first tried them.  </li>
      <li>I have long very fine hair and this cleans well</li>
      <li>Getting it all done satisfactorily in one step is even more important now that I have two little kids.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s very particular about what she uses</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know what they were thinking of with this formula change, but it will likely lose me as a loyal Dove hair care customer!</li>
      <li>Decent scent as well.</li>
      <li>It has a nice thick texture which refreshes the hair, cleans and conditions well.</li>
      <li>But worse, my hair gets greasier far more quickly than it used to - and given that that is an issue I already have generally, that is just unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Met my expectations completely.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to find a good shampoo to manage all the craziness.</li>
      <li>Not sure what This Seller Is Doing?&lt;br /&gt;It is a Good product as I have Used it in the past.</li>

    <li> Met my expectations completely. I am highly satisfied with this product.The product was shipped in good condition and I got it on time too.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the ones that have the shampoo and conditioner separate but is recommended nonetheless. This is an all in one solution for your hair care needs.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal user of Dove&#x27;s hair products for over 10 years.  They were a revelation for my medium-ish texture, wavy, and tangle-prone hair when I first tried them.  The 2-in-1 was AMAZING - to get my hair clean and 3/4 conditioned in one step?  Awesome!  Getting it all done satisfactorily in one step is even more important now that I have two little kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now - I am extremely unhappy with the formula change starting with the set I got last year.  My hair is definitely not as well conditioned with this formulation.  But worse, my hair gets greasier far more quickly than it used to - and given that that is an issue I already have generally, that is just unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking of with this formula change, but it will likely lose me as a loyal Dove hair care customer!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair beautiful</li>
    <li> I have tried all sorts of brands, many require using a lot of shampoo, making them very uneconomical... I have long very fine hair and this cleans well, I don&#x27;t have to use much, I use it almost everyday and it doesn&#x27;t over-condition fine hair.  I do use a shampoo without conditioner about once a week to avoid any buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If it had a milder scent, I would give it five stars.  For some reason this is hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this shampoo and we can not find it anywhere. So when I seen it here I ordered her 3 bottles. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Not bad if you&#x27;re looking for convenience in the shower. Not the best shampoo - felt it was too heavy on the conditioning  part.</li>
    <li> I do not usually have trouble with dandruff, but some shampoos make my head itch.  I used the Dove Shampoo for two months and slowly the itching began, and yesterday my wife looked at my head and told me I had bad dandruff.  I looked at hers today (black hair to her butt) and she&#x27;s covered in dandruff also, told me she&#x27;d been using my Dove because it smelled so good.  She&#x27;s never had dandruff before in her life.  Nobody else on the reviews is mentioning this, so I thought I&#x27;d better say something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still love my Dove Bar soap.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years and it&#x27;s the nicest soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My mom had me order this for her and she likes it... thats all i can say. and she&#x27;s very particular about what she uses</li>
    <li> it works good, there&#x27;s better but this is good for the price, frieda products have a slight edge, pantene,  and sassoon, but its still a personal thing</li>
    <li> I am used to using shampoo and conditioner separately due to having long hair.  Yet, I thought I would buy this since it was on sale and it does almost as equally good job and it takes less time to shampoo when using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had dandruff in my life, prior to using this shampoo for several months. I did not get a terrible case of it, but I definitely got it. Since I&#x27;ve stopped using this product, my dandruff has gone away with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed using this shampoo, though. It has a nice thick texture which refreshes the hair, cleans and conditions well. Decent scent as well.</li>
    <li> When I Purchased The Add said (Pack of 2) and the invoice and shipper says (Pack of 2) although now I see the add&lt;br /&gt;does not say (Pack of 2) Plus The Price has changed so it must have been changed after my purchase. This is the reason for only 2 Stars. Not sure what This Seller Is Doing?&lt;br /&gt;It is a Good product as I have Used it in the past.</li>
    <li> Dove has changed their formula 1000 times but it still works the same. The smell is always great, although sometimes different. I love that their shampoo + conditioner isn&#x27;t just another shampoo. It does make your hair feel conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, mixed (dry and oily) hair and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to find a good shampoo to manage all the craziness. With cheaper brands, there is a noticeable waxed feeling. I&#x27;ve been using Dove for 5 years now and my hair is always soft, light, fragrant, and smooth.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have every used. I love all the Dove products.</li>
    <li> this shampoo/conditioner  is great for my hair  after using this shampoo  my hair feels clean  I have been looking and looking .well I have found it</li>
    <li> As what I have written in title, this is what I think best one of the cheap choices. If you don&#x27;t want spend much on shampoo, I think that is a nice choice. ruguo ni youqian  paul mitchell xifashui zhen de hen haoyong..</li>
    <li> Very gentle and yet, a very effective cleanser for the hair and the smell is refreshing and not over powering like others...I like what it does for my hair and will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this combo when I am in a hurry, usually after a workout. It smells nice and does not dry out my hair.</li>
