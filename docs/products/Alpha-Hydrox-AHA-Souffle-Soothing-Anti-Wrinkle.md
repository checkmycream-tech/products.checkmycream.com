<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to help my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard many good things about this and decided to give it a try a couple of months ago. After a month of use and no other change to my routine, I stopped because the only difference I saw was break outs :(</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. My sister does too. Make sure to wear sunscreen during the day if you use this at night.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about 5-6 years and absolutely love it! I previously used the 10% cream for a lot of years prior, which was fine, but like the souffle much better. It even zaps my occasional middle age zits. Make sure you use sunscreen with this product if used during the day. It has really improved the look of my normal-oily skin. I use it morning and evening and wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I have not received this item yet - the souffle -  Alpha  Hydrox confirms NO animal testing</li>
    <li> This is a great product, that helps with wrinkles and also has helped me with scars. My 13yr old daughter loves this product too.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t remember buying this one</li>
    <li> This product really irritated my skin. I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to find out if it worked.</li>
    <li> I used this product for just two days. My face became more sensitive and red, especially under the eyes. The skin on my cheek also became dry and itchy. Don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I love it. if you want glowing skin this is the product you want.</li>
    <li> I have used Alpha Hydrox Souffle and other Alpha Hydrox products for the last 15 years. It is an incredible product. In the past year it has become unavailable at our local Rite Aid and Walgreens up here in the boonies of upstate NY. I have tried other products, Loreal, Olay, and others and nothing produces results like this product for my skin.     I decided to try buying it on line and placed my order. It promptly arrived 4 days later and I ran to the sink to clean my face and start my face routine. When I opened the jar it was nearly empty and so dried out it was not spreadable. I&#x27;d say the jar had a half inch of product if lucky. You could see where it had dehydrated back to the glass and just plain dried out and shrunk. This WAS NOT THE FLUFFY SOUFFLE I was used to. I opened the second jar I ordered, same thing!     First off, I am wondering if this product is being made any more as it is no longer available in the major chains up here in Northern NY as well as in the greater Boston area. Did I get some dried up old inventory sold off to a schlock vendor? I hope not but it would appear to be. The jars have a serial number that starts with 2005. I called the toll free line of Neuterics listed on the jar and got the classic pick a number routine. I was able to leave a number for them to call me back. If they do and make good on their product I will run to rewrite this review. For now, consider it fabulous product, horrible service, and what good is it if it is a dried up 1/4 filled jar? Don&#x27;t spend your money here until we know. I am dating this review 04/02/10 and if you don&#x27;t see my correction for improved customer service, stay away. In this econonomy, who has money to waste?</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old and have tried every high-end product on the market. After one week of using the Souffle my skin glowed, felt extrememly soft, and was noticed by my husband (who doesn&#x27;t notice anything!) Some other products left my skin greasy or dry and flaking. I have rosacea and it has become less noticable. This is just right and I can&#x27;t say enough good about it. Nothing is going to change my skin back to my 20&#x27;s but this does a great job of aging gracefully.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years.  I first learned about it when I was a college student and saw a segment on a news program that said this product was better than expensive, high-end creams sold at department stores.  At the time, I found it at K-Mart for $7.00.  It is no longer sold at K-mart and I went for a few years without using it.  It was during this period that I realized how wonderful this product was.  When I didn&#x27;t use the product, my skin looked \\&quot;old\\&quot; and \\&quot;textured\\&quot;.  Once I found the product again I was amazed at how youthful my skin looked.  I am over 40 and I have flawless skin and do not need to use any foundation to cover any imperfections.  People always ask me for my beauty secret and I also give full credit to my Alhpa Hydroxy from Neoteric.  It is cheap and it is amazing.  I just gave my 15 year old daughter a jar of it and told her to use it on her acne-prone skin.  She came up to me after using the product for a week and said that her skin is so much better.  Now you know that it must work, because it is not often that a 15 year old daughter acknowleges her mother&#x27;s advice.  Miracle in a jar!!</li>
    <li> amazing line of products; inexpensive and very efficient. high concentration of active ingredients, no fragrance or coloring; i&#x27;m using the entire line-without a doubt beats high end brands like Peter Roth whose products are quite fascinating but glycolic producs didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love how it helped my skin look younger</li>
    <li> I saw a difference after 2 applications!  My only criticism is the jar packaging.  Exposure to air tends to destroy antioxidants; tube packaging would have made this a superior product.  But, that aside, it wears beautifully under makeup during the day and mingles nicely with my moisturizer and antioxidant oil at bedtime.  It&#x27;s non irritating despite it&#x27;s high Glycolic content.</li>
    <li> It feels nice when I put it on, but the wrinkles are still with me.</li>
    <li> i will not deny that i don&#x27;t have acne ...but after using this product for more than a week , it makes my skin breakout and is getting worse ! i read some reviews that sometimes it will make u  breakout , should i keep using it till i see results??</li>
    <li> Everything that other good reviews say about this product is true. I am a physician and have used the same compound  (glycolic acid)for years now. I find there is nothing better for wrinkles or black spots. This particular presentation is very easy to use and very effective. I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE March 7, 2017: I was nervous about ordering another bottle since a number of reviews said the formula had changed after the rebranding and wasn&#x27;t as effective. I haven&#x27;t found this to be true for me, it works just the same in my opinion. A nice light sting lets me know it&#x27;s working, and I even prefer the new tube design which lets me use only as much as I want, instead of dipping my fingers into a big tub. Not sure what the other complaints are about, still seems like the same old great product to me.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: Love this cream, skin felt smoother and softer almost instantly and with no visible dryness (which has always been a problem for me). I wear it at night and put on a moisturizer after letting it soak in a few minutes, which helps. My only warning concerns the packaging - the Amazon product page shows a tube which the company recently switched to in order to preserve the active ingredients better, but I was sent a jar, which was the old design. It still works just fine for now but I try not to keep the jar open for too long just in case.</li>
    <li> I had stopped using Alpha Hydrox for a while - I kept meaning to order more, but I had other creams to use, and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference - at first...When I notices the fine lines coming back, I realized I needed to reorder NOW!  I tried the 10% solution first and did see an improvement in my skin, but not as much as I&#x27;d seen with the 12% product I had been using.  So back to the 12%.  There is a definite difference versus the other affordable skin care products.  My skin is smoother, and doesn&#x27;t break out as much (after the first 2 or so weeks when the breakouts were more noticable).  Skin discoloration is less, and my makeup goes on more smoothly.  And best of all, people are surprised when I tell them how old I am (they usually were guessing 5 to 10 years less).      One caveat - in the winter my skin does get drier with the 12% (less with the 10%) and I do need to use a moisturizer on top of the Alpha Hydrox. In the summer I don&#x27;t need the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This packaged well and was in good shape.  The product was did not work as well as I had hope, but that has nothing to do with the vendor.  I would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Even though this is advertised for fine lines, I use it for acne (because of its high AHA content).  It clears skin up within 6 weeks and evens out tone.  I&#x27;m not wasting my money on anything else now that I know this product is out there, and is very affordable.</li>
    <li> Glycolic Acid is the one ingredient that you want your facial products to have.  If you have problem skin such as acne, uneven skin tone, oily skin, dry skin or wrinkles you can count on glycolic acid to fix those problems.  I bought this product because glycolic acid was recommended for my skin by my skin care specialist many years ago.  I have uneven skin texture, oilyness and acne.  I bought some very pricey glycolic acid from her and it did work wonders but the price was way too much for me ($50.00 a jar!).  So ever since I have been searching for something similiar and I think I have found it with the \\&quot;Alpha Hydroxy\\&quot; line.  And who can beat that price??  When I say I searched for similiar products, I am not kidding.  I have thrown out and gave away (not to mention stored away) so many products that didn&#x27;t work it is crazy.      One thing you must understand is that you have got to be faithful with this stuff.  Don&#x27;t skimp and don&#x27;t skip treatments unless you have a skin reaction.  First you got to get your pores open and a simple pot of steaming water with a towel wrapped over your head should do the trick.  Buy the facial wash and wash your face gently.  Slather this souffle on and go to bed.  You should feel some tingle and that is good because that means you got some open pores and this souffle is sinking in.  If you don&#x27;t feel the tingle, don&#x27;t give up on this product!  Keep using this every day and you should see some difference in a week or so.      I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin in only two weeks.  And the amazing part is that I could see a difference in my skin texture within the first few days.  The climate here is very dry and my skin was suffering from being too dry also.  This product fixed that.  AMAZING!  My acne along the jawline is also clearing up a little at a time.  But it is going away and that is a huge relief because this product is working.  The fine lines on my forehead are also slowly disappearing.    One more thing about using this product for acne.  I was watching a infomercial about a new skin care line that is supposed to be better than ProActive (which I have tried and it didn&#x27;t work).  I wanted to see what the main ingredient was because they did not use benzoyl peroxide.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it when they said glycolic acid was their main ingredient.  And here we are getting the same benefits with the \\&quot;Alpha Hydroxy\\&quot; line without having to be bothered with orders over the phone, trial memberships and pushing more products that we don&#x27;t want or need.    Glycolic acid can be pricey so to be getting a jar for this price is a bargain.  Don&#x27;t let that cheap price fool you....this stuff works.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled with the results that I have gotten with this product in the short time that I have been using it. I am skeptical about most products that promise results in which acne or fine lines will improve dramatically with use but this is the only one that has delivered on those promises for me.    I am 36 years old and I have fair, sensitive, oily, extremely acne prone skin and it has been a problem for me for over 20 years. I have tried everything to keep my acne under control. Everything! But nothing has ever worked for long. My biggest problem is pores that clog like crazy and nothing I tried could keep them clear, so I would be broken out constantly or just ready to break out. It doesn&#x27;t help that I am skin obsessed either ( touching and picking is a no-no, but I couldn&#x27;t help it) so my skin always looked raw and sore. I also have scarring and and using makeup to help cover the damage only made me break out more, so I felt helpless everyday and depressed.    After going to a dermatologist, he said that I was going about this the wrong way entirely. I had been using benzoyl peroxide products and he said that for older skin this can aggravate the problem even more. Instead, he gave me a glycolic acid/ salicylic acid face wash and told me to try this product in addition to see if it helped at all to keep my pores unclogged and it really does! I used to have many blackheads and clogged pores and now they are drastically reduced. I look at my skin and see very few to none now and for me that is a miracle. I am losing the desire to constantly touch my face as well. This product makes your skin baby soft and helps to erase fine lines too. I also use it on my chest, where I also used to break out constantly, and that has helped enormously as well.    The price, benefits and promises that this product deliver are all reasons to buy this product. But you will keep using it after discovering how amazing it can be for your skin to be mostly clear almost allof the time if you have suffered with acne as I have. I am so so happy with the results I got.    When first using it your skin will tingle and feel burning, but that goes away. I only use it at night and I also mix the product with moisturizer to hydrate my skin at the same time. Also, you might break out a little until you have used the product for a few days as I did, but then I cleared up and have stayed clear. This truly is a miracle in a jar!</li>
    <li> I suffered from mild acne for years until I read about how Glycolic Acid can actually help with acne. This is my third time ordering it and I will never stop. My skin have changed completely, acne scars has gone, I hardly ever break out and my skin is glowing. Amazing product with such a decent price.... I use Glycolic Acid peel 35pc once or twice a month and I found that helped too.</li>
    <li> YES.  I am 26, with dry, sensitive skin.  Taking birth control for more than 5 years has left me with hyper-pigmentation and uneven skin tone.  I purchased this cream after recently quitting smoking as part of my \\&quot;taking care of myself\\&quot; routine... and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I use this stuff AM &amp; PM, and have found it to be extraordinarily well-tolerated.  I used to exfoliate my face with St. Ives (I know.) every morning.  If I didn&#x27;t, I would end up with nasty flakes, no matter how much moisturizer I used.  My skin would feel like an oil slick, but still dry underneath, and this would lead to breakouts.  I have been using this cream as an exfoliant in conjunction with filtered jojoba oil, and the results have been just really delightful.  Even, bright skin tone (noticeable results after a week, although skin feels better after the first use), minimized pores, and an all-over glow that is SO EXCITING!  Don&#x27;t be afraid of the tingle/itchiness for the first few days; it subsided after a half hour or so and did NOT lead to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Ulta for around $15.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this cream, and am planning on purchasing another jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (still using 3 months later):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this came in a pump container.  ONLY complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic, affordable alpha hydroxy cream.  It has a reasonable percentage of glycolic acid to use as a nightly exfoliating product.  It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and provides consistent improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something heavier, I would recommend Skin Laboratory&#x27;s 35% glycolic peel.  This Alpha Hydrox cream will NOT give you the dramatic results a peel with a higher percentage will.  It WILL, however, maintain the results from said peels and will refine your skin.  I really recommend this cream as an alternative to manual exfoliation.  It also works as a spot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, make sure you use sunblock religiously, as with any alpha hydroxy.  This is really important.  Not only will your hard work be canceled out, you will see OPPOSITE results (i.e. dark spots will become darker, etc.).  This is why I recommend using this cream at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++ HG material.be canceled out, you will see OPPOSITE results (i.e. dark spots will become darker, etc.).  This is why I recommend using this cream at night.    A++ HG material.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  From the first time I put it on it has made my skin look amazing and helped to clear up my acne.  In terms of acne it works better then anything else I have tried including prescriptions and Proactive.  I will never be without this product again.  It is drying so I only use it every other day and pair it with a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought the product on the advise of a cosmetologist. It has helped reduce redness on my face in just two weeks which I really appreciate. I will keep using it. There have been no adverse side affects and I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Someone at work recommended this to me, and I&#x27;m very happy with it and it&#x27;s results.  I think it has improved the texture of my skin. You do have to be careful and use a sunscreen, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I&#x27;m going to get some for my daughter, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 3 months but I haven&#x27;t seen any change to my skin, except that the cheek areas on the sides of my nose are not as rough as they used to be. Other than that, my pores are still as enlarged as before, my age spots (and believe me, they are very small, and only three of them) are not improved and the texture of my skin is unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the consistency, though. It&#x27;s very light and not greasy so I prefer it over Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t buy again if I find a better exfoliating product.</li>
    <li> Another AHXY product that is not cheap. It is meant to have a higher percentage of acid but merely feels waxy and inactive. Upon contacting the company rep, I was told the rep checked the lots and that these lots of new product should not have expired. Perhaps the fault is in the suspension, that the active ingredient simply does not remain so in either of these two products.  David Ogilvy once said that that great marketing can only make a bad product fail faster. This is one such product. And there was no offer of restitution or anything of the kind. Again, don&#x27;t fall for this.</li>
    <li> I got a horrible reaction to this cream. My face got terribly scarred and I am still recovering from it. I have used these products before,but for some reason this time I did not get a peel only painful blemishes a burning rash and large bright red and brown dried scabs.Just a very bad reaction!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 12% Alpha Hydrox Souffle for years, and my skin looks awful without it. It&#x27;s not a moisturizer, but it dissolves dead skin and keeps me smooth. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve started using a couple of drops of vitamin E oil after I apply the Alpha Hydrox, before it dries, but at this time, that&#x27;s all the &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I don&#x27;t use the Alpha Hydrox, my skin looks like I never wash my face, even though I scrub it diligently twice a day. I dread the day they stop making this stuff -- it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least ten years now.  I&#x27;m fifty years old and my skin looks better then it did in my thirties.Ok Ok I&#x27;ve got more wrinkes, deeper wrinkles BUT my skin is clearer and smoother. Acne scars are gone. This product is excellent and has made me look better.</li>
    <li> I am truly a believer now. I am a 25 year old male with oily skin. I get individual breakouts every other month or so. I was looking for a product that I would be able to use for many years to come. I was out walking in the park oneday when I over heard a group of elderly women talking about using the alpha hydroxy line. There skin was simply beautiful. They looked around 60 but I knew by the way that they talked they were much older. So I rushed home and bought the entire line here off amazon. It has been 5 days and my skin glows, literaaly glows. My skin is firmer and more plump than before. I am a beleiver and permanent customer. Thanks ladies for talking so loud!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is great cream for those who want an anti-aging and an anti-blemish cream.  It actually even out my skin tone and makes my skin feel nice and soft in the process.  I think my skin actually \\&quot;glows\\&quot;. :-) I noticed the difference within a week.  I have really sensitive skin, if I put on the wrong type of moisturizer or cream, I will break out.  This product doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out...instead it does exactly what it said it would do.  I am pleasantly surprised.  Plus the price is nice.  This is a great product for my skin type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and my skin looks amazing. It was a bit dry and hanging. After a week of alpha hydrox it seems to have replaced some of its elasticity. It now looks more youthful and no longer dry. I&#x27;ve tried Neurium at a cost of $80 and alpha hydrox felt the same if not better at an excellent cost.</li>
    <li> While this product came highly recommended, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to wake up the first morning after using it and see a dramatic improvement in the texture of my skin. But that is what happened. I have some mild acne (close comedones) and have been fighting stubborn fine lines on my forehead, and both looked miles better. My skin was smooth and firm and beautiful. I was not sure if starting with such a high percentage of AHA would cause irritation, but I have not had any issues. I have been using it for about a week now and my skin consistently looks beautiful. I&#x27;m really pleased by the results, especially considering the price of the product.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It gives a freshness to my skin.  It does not irritate or cause skin eruptions.  It is not expensive as skin care products go.   It&#x27;s simple really, if some company wanted to advertise, market as a miracle, and promote it everywhere, it would raise it&#x27;s price to 150.00 and people would pay it gladly.  They pay that and more for products not as good.  I know, I&#x27;ve done that.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff.  Use it nearly every night.  I had a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in a year come to visit me.  We have been friends since 1999.  I am in my mid-thirties.  She told me I have never looked younger &amp; my skin has never looked so nice.  I told her what I was using.  This stuff in not expensive &amp; it works.  You can feel a difference in your skin overnight.  This is better than the expensive stuff you buy in department stores or online.  Lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Item shown not delivered. Updated, smaller product delivered.</li>
    <li> Im (Marlon Cousin) Lemisha, this cream is really a work of art, i an ordering another tube and im looking out for more great results, in cojunction to this i have been using skin obsession glycolic acid peel 30%. I am going to up grade to 40% and this cream to get better results. But compaired to how my face was it has helped alot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the Alpha Hydrox products for several years. I&#x27;m 38 going on 39, and some people still mistake me for 25 to early 30&#x27;s. I especially love the 12% Souffle cream. Trust me, if you purchase this product, it will work SO well that you may take it for granted someday. Don&#x27;t! I made that mistake, and it almost cost me my skin!    I had run out of the souffle and was lazy one day when repurchasing my skin care products, so I bought a drugstore brand of a popular new \\&quot;Simply Radiant\\&quot; skin care system with fancy \\&quot;Soy Proteins\\&quot; in it. I wanted to even out my skin tone (African-American, with a couple of dark dots left over from a few small pimples). After using the moisturizer for a week, I started developing cystic acne-type bumps on my face!! BIG pus-filled lumps that developed in clusters on my cheeks and forehead. I was horrified. I immediately stopped using the moisturizer, and the cysts stopped developing, but the damage was done; I had slowly-healing cystic acne bumps on my face. When I returned the cream to the drug store, the clerk took one look at me and quickly gave me my money back; the bad skin reaction was that obvious.    I ordered the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle as soon as I could, along with the Alpha Hydrox 14% AHA swipes to help accelerate my skin exfoliation. I used the swipes 3 times a week, and the souffle morning and night. After a month, I finally got the acne under control. After two months, my skin was smooth again.  After six months, I was able to take the most gorgeous headshots I&#x27;ve ever had done, and the graphic artist only had to retouch \\&quot;shine\\&quot; on my forehead and chin. There&#x27;s only a pinhead-sized indentation left over from the acne scars, and all the deep-colored hyperpigmented spots have completely healed and disappeared. My skin is baby-smooth, even toned, and if I had told you that approximately eight months ago I had deep acne scars on my face, you would never believe me.    I&#x27;m back to just the Souffle morning and eveningfor maintenance, but I&#x27;ll NEVER take using my Alpha Hydrox products for granted ever again!</li>
    <li> This stuff works, but Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s Enhanced AHA Creme works just as well (despite being a slightly lower percentage of AHA), contains more (2 oz vs 1.6 oz) and costs several dollars less. I&#x27;ve used them both and find the lower percentage a better bargain.</li>
    <li> great product, it tingled at first which is a good thing and made my face soft and smooth, will buy again and again</li>
    <li> With regular use of this 12% alpha hydroxy acid, you will have smoother, silkier skin in no time.  There are so many skin products out there that are horrendously expensive but not nearly effective as this.  \\&quot;Souffle\\&quot; perfectly describes the lightness of this cream.  It just melts into your skin.  You can wear this as a day or night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Alpha Hydrox skin products for a long time.  But, the big box store I went to stopped carrying the brand.  I was delighted to find it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for about a year now. I feel like it&#x27;s a face lift in a bottle. I put it on before bed and wake up feeling like my skin is tight and my pores are small. My skin is so soft when I use it regularly. I love it. I use the Alpha Hydrox lotion on my back and it cleared up any blemishes I would get from time to time. I&#x27;ve never had perfect skin in my life until I tried this line of products. I will warn that if you get this product on sensitive areas, it can burn. I&#x27;ve gotten cold sores before if I accidentally get it on my lips. It can irritate sensitive skin so keep it away from those areas.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product because I have heard such great things about Alpha Hydrox products. But honestly after two months of use, I don&#x27;t see any big difference in my skin. Alas, my search for the fountain of youth continues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used the Alpha Hydrox brand in the past, always with great results, but never the 12% solution. Here&#x27;s the thing: When you put this lotion on you can actually feel it working. There&#x27;s a mild tingle/burning sensation. And within minutes you can detect a discernible difference in your skin&#x27;s appearance. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that tones your skin, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and fades dark circles under the eyes, look no further. This stuff is inexpensive, a jar lasts a long time, and it works absolute wonders.</li>
    <li> This AHA souffle is extremely effective; it contains more AHA than other OTC skin treatments, so I find it to be more effective, while still managing to be easy on the skin.  An excellent daily treatment for mature skin, even highly sensitive complexions.</li>
    <li> Ok so I decided to purchase &amp; try this cream before investing a little more money on other products. Now I just wish I had gone ahead and spent the extra money on one of the peels I was initially going to go with &amp; I will now. This Alpha cream is nothing but a moisturiser, for me at least. I saw NO difference, changes, smoothness, firmness, Nothing by using this cream.  It works for some, I guess but did nothing for me. I guess all I can say is try at your own risk, you may safe money now but will spend more later......its up to you. Live &amp; learn.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this after reading all the great reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about five months now.  The breakouts are UNBEARABLE.  I get pimples!! under my chin, on my neck, under my nose, on my nose, on my forehead.....I break out terribly.  I thought, after reading the reviews, that this would pass and the benefits would far outweigh the breakouts but this product has made me break out worse than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I went so far as to purchase their foaming face wash and moisturizer to see if using products from the same line would lessen the breakouts.  I hate my complexion right now.  I don&#x27;t see any benefit.  Sorry.  What was this product supposed to do again?  I have to reiterate....terrible terrible pimples.  Gross.  I haven&#x27;t broken out this badly since I was a teenager.  I&#x27;m embarrassed.  Still have an unopened jar so the good thing is that I didn&#x27;t spend $50 for a jar so it won&#x27;t bother me so much to give it away to someone that might like it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for four years. Just love it. I have oily but sensitive skin and this is the a few skincare i am using for recent years. you can see your skin tone improved in the next morning and black heads deminished. It has never disappointed me.strongly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Not only is it affordable, but it works. It will not give you instant results but over time it certainly improves my 40-something skin. I also exfoliate daily with a sugar and olive oil scrub to improve texture. Thanks Alpha Hydrox!!</li>
    <li> The  first cream bought the cream with 10 percent but this product is 14 percent so thought more is better. Not sure yet, I feel a tingle and read the reviews so jury still out. As of right now my skin feels softer.</li>
    <li> I am 24 years old and was searching for a cream that I can stick with for many years to come. This is the absolute only cream that has ever given me visible results in a short period of time. My skin RARELY breaks out anymore and my skin tone is sooooo even now. This also works wonders on old acne scars. This particular product may tend to dry out your skin so as reccomended on the jar I usually follow it up with a moisturizer. I just use the alpha hydrox spf 15 moisturizer. Another bit of advice if you are looking to try these products ....the alpha hydrox website is so much cheaper. I got a whole set that included the souffle, spf 15 lotion, facial peel, spot lightener, and face wash for around $40 including shipping. Their site also offers a whole sample set of all of the products listed above for $1 a piece. I bought 7 samples to test out before I bought the full size products. Also, you will learn from the website that its normal to break out when you first start using it because your skin is getting used to the aha&#x27;s. I broke out a tiny bit and then it went away and now its working wonders. Now, if Alpha Hydrox would just invent a cream that cures chronic dark undereye cirlces I would be flawless.</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake. I thought I was ordering the Alpha Hydrox that comes in a jar. This one came in a very small tube and there&#x27;s not much product. I went through it fast. I&#x27;ve been using Alpha Hydrox for years and I rely on it to keep the wrinkles at bay. I&#x27;m 55 now. If you can find it I suggest buying the one in the jar - it&#x27;s a better deal. I still give it 5 stars though, despite the small size of the product - it is after all, a great product in my book.</li>
    <li> I combine this with a prescription retin-A cream (retin A the first night; Alpha Hydroxy the next 3).  This combo is as effective as a light peel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little over a week and can already see a marked difference in the condition of my skin.  I am in my upper 20&#x27;s with combination skin, large pores on my nose and on the apples of my cheeks, and am prone to adult acne.  I&#x27;m starting to see very slight laugh lines and a few lines between my eyebrows.  After just a week, my skin is smoother, my pores are refined, and my fine lines are diminishing.  ONE WEEK!  My skin has not broken out and purged yet as others have warned.  My acne scars have faded.  My skin is not oily nor dry when using this product and I have not had any sensitivity issues (I usually have sensitive skin).  This has been a miracle product!  I have been using it morning and night after cleansing, and have no problems applying makeup over it as it absorbs well into the skin.  A little bit goes a long way.  If you&#x27;re looking to try a glycolic acid product for minor resurfacing, this is a great place to start.  It&#x27;s an excellent product for the price!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Foaming Face Wash, AHA Souffle, AHA Gel, &amp; Silk Moisturizer.  I love all of the products.  Consistancy is the key to this product, always wash twice a day and apply the creams that you chose to use.  Helps fade sun spots, soften wrinkles, minimize pours.  I have used this off and on for many years now and ALWAYS come back to this.  Wish I would learn my lesson.  Besides a professional Obaji Chemical Peel this is the best product I have used.  Wish I had begun using this right after my chemical peel.</li>
    <li> Tingly, fresh, glowing skin for a great price. Everyone comments on my glowing skin. Helps with mild acne as well. Not greasy, nice consistency. I have been using for months! LUV LUV LUV it!</li>
    <li> DTHIS IS AN INEXPENSIVE FACE PRODUCT TO REDUCE AGING FACE SKIN.  EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU, I HAVE ORDERED IT MANY TIMES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BARBARA R.</li>
    <li> A friend told me that her facialist told her to always use AH every night. Since AHA by itself is hardly available at your standard drug store, I tried amazon and found this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need is to get facials periodically and use this cream at night and you will have smooth skin always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to mix a little of this with  my favorite moisterizer at night as my skin does well that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I stop using this for whatever reason, it is obvious every time; rough crappy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Oh and I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts and have had no issues ever with this product.</li>
    <li> it was exactly as the one purchased before.  fast shipping</li>
    <li> This might be the best product i&#x27;ve ever used. Improves the skin texture, corrects uneven skin tone and gives the skin a nice , healthy glow. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> total waste of money, does not work at all</li>
    <li> Makes my face look as if it was crafted from baby bottoms. However I prefer my soufflé edible.</li>
    <li> NIce product. Goes on smooth...not sure that it does miracles but I have only used it a month now. I will continue to use it for now.  I have tried many products and they all work about same.  This is a great value...it&#x27;s not a crazy price and does the same as much more expensive creams.</li>
    <li> It works but gives me break outs every single day, after using it for almost 2 months.</li>
    <li> I tried this after seeing the reviews on the site. I have used this product once daily for well over a month along with the AH cleanser and spf lotion. The other products are nice. The souffle said stinging would be a normal side effect for the first few weeks, so I stuck with it. To this day, the stinging is still intense and I have seen no positive change in my skin. I was hoping that it would alleviate my acne/scars, but I&#x27;m breaking out worse than ever. If the stinging or acne does not calm soon, it looks like I&#x27;ll have to move on to the next product. The Neutrogena Acne system looks promising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now, along with jojoba oil for extra moisture. This is probably the best product I&#x27;ve bought for my face to date. Alpha hydroxy acid is an exfoliator that works by weakening the bonds between skin cells, thus increasing the cell turn over rate. What does this mean? You&#x27;ll wake up with fresh new skin revealed. What does this mean in the long run? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve been trying to look into medical texts regarding the dangers of using AHA long term. AHA is currently regarded as safe but I wonder whether altering the rate of skin cell production in the long run would cause any harm. What&#x27;s known though, is that it&#x27;s IMPORTANT to use sun screen while using this product! Using it will help prevent skin cancer especially when your skin is in such a fragile state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a somewhat heavy cream, hence souffle and all it takes is a little dab in the pot and onto your skin. Results I&#x27;ve noticed: smoother skin, clearer skin. Wonderful buy. And a little goes a long way. I think it&#x27;ll be at least a year before I finish the jar. I use it at night, daily.</li>
    <li> I have fair, sun-damage prone skin, minor rosacea and mild acne. I have only used a few times so far, and I am thrilled to see my skin is smoother looking and brighter already. Even if you&#x27;re young, this product is a great alternative to expensive treatments at the spa. It did burn a bit at first but that subsided within a few minutes. You just leave it on--no washing off. I&#x27;ll update as I get farther along. Soo happy! :)</li>
    <li> I order this for my daughter and use it occasionally myself.  The only ingredient is glycolic acid and does not have and a lot of other ingredients, which I am a little tired of.  I was glad to see that Amazon carries this product since you cannot buy it in any local stores.</li>
    <li> Received two units of the Alpha Hydrox AHA souffle 12%  Delivery time was longer then expected, and one jar had been previously opened. Thru that one away. Diffinitely not satisfied.</li>
    <li> Feels moisturizing and a nice light summer face cream. Not rich enough for use in our Colorado winter, but great for warmer months. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this at night 3-4 times a week.  It makes my skin tingle and deinitely refines my skin.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I seen no results as to all the reviews .Put it on night and day as it says. And I seen no improvement.</li>
    <li> I have never taken the time to actually review a product but I just had to for this one.  Let me tell you a little bit about my skin condition and how this product has affected me.    I&#x27;m 26 years old with very fair skin.  However, many of my high school/college years were spent in a tanning bed.  I&#x27;ve always loved my skin when tan but when it finally sunk in that if I kept tanning I would look like a prune, I luckily stopped for good.  However, I always hated the way my skin looked.  Very blotchy, often dry, and I still get pimples at 26! I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun and nothing, at least for me has lived up to its promises!    This product is truly amazing.  When I first tried it, it stung my sensitive skin.  I used it for about 2 weeks then stopped because I didn&#x27;t think it was working.  If you have acne prone skin, it will make you break out a little at first because all of those pimples will be forced to the surface.  So I stopped using it.  However, after reading all the good reviews, I decided to give it another shot.  It&#x27;s been about a month of using this product and boy have I seen drastic changes in my skin.  My skin is 100 percent softer and smoother.  Old acne scars that I had (my skin scars very easily) are lightening up and my complexion is much more even.  And, the best part is, I get no more pimples so don&#x27;t have to use drying products like benzoyl peroxide anymore!!  My face is so smoothe throughout the day and it stays that way!  It is truly amazing, but the trick is, you HAVE to give it about a month before you will truly see results! Be patient!!    Ok, for those with a similar skin condition to me, just want to let you know my skin care routine using this product.      Morning - wash with cetaphil daily cleanser, apply alpha hydroxy souffle, let dry then apply good moisturizer ( i use eucerine spf30) Make sure you use a noncomedogenic one with a good sunscreen!!    Evening - wash with plexion cleansing clothes (need prescription), apply alpha hydroxy souffle, then a good night cream ( i use neutrogena visibly even night cream and it&#x27;s worked wonders)    I also take nicomide which is a vitamin my dermatologist prescribed for helping with acne.    Sorry this review is so long, but I just really wanted to offer my advice and let you know what has given me amazing results!  If it wasn&#x27;t for websites like this, I would never have known to purchase all of the products I use! I really hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> Quickly approaching (a still, sadly, rather vain) age 40, I have personally spent a small fortune over the years trying to slow the aging process and reverse the effects of too many days spent gardening without sunscreen.  I cannot even begin to list all the products I&#x27;ve somewhat foolishly gambled on to get my skin looking better.  This product--and several other products offered through the company NEOTERIC (all under the Alpha Hydrox brand)--are exactly the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I&#x27;ve used them both alone and in conjunction with a more expensive brand of anti-aging products (for which I&#x27;ve also left good reviews on this site), and I can see great improvements both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy cream after reading in Dr. Oz&#x27;s (and Dr. Roizen&#x27;s) book [[ASIN:0743292561 You: Staying Young: The Owner&#x27;s Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You)]].  I&#x27;d tried several other alpha hydroxy products before this one (i.e. ROC, etc.) and must say this particular line (ALPHA HYDROX) is far superior to any other I&#x27;ve used.  That it is also apparently considerably less expensive than most is icing on the cake, in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this product, I find the key is to use it AT LEAST once a day, and always after using a mild cleanser.  At my age I still get acne and, despite my sometimes manic picking, I notice it (and any residual puffiness or redness, and resulting scarring) clears up much, much more quickly than it used to.  Also, my skin breaks out much less than before I used this.  The tone and color of my skin are far improved when compared to prior to using this product.  I&#x27;ve run out of it before and tried to use something else until I was able to locate more locally, and to my dismay the condition of my skin began to deteriorate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t try to insult anyone by saying the Alpha Hydrox line will remove every wrinkle or fix all your skincare woes.  If there is a product out there that does this, I want to know!  But for now, this is by far the best line of products I&#x27;ve used.  I use this item, particularly, with the line of skincare I reviewed previously, as that seems to address reversing the signs of aging better (where this one, for me, just improves the overall condition and appearance of my skin).s by far the best line of products I&#x27;ve used.  I use this item, particularly, with the line of skincare I reviewed previously, as that seems to address reversing the signs of aging better (where this one, for me, just improves the overall condition and appearance of my skin).</li>
    <li> Not that good i used another product that was 5% from the health food store that was better. This had no sting at all. Moved on to 35% from another company....still questioning these kind of face products and their value.</li>
    <li> This is usually more expensive and comes in a smaller quantity than their basic cream or lotion but it really don&#x27;t have the same exfoliating qualities. The original product feels wonderful after only a few times of use and you can tell the difference but this is pretty much worthless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard SO MANY great things about this product from close to 50 or so people. People say if you have acne or problem skin to us this and it&#x27;ll help clear everything up. Sadly I didn&#x27;t get those results. It caused me to break out. I was hoping this would help my skin but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve also heard from a number of ladies with mature skin that this stuff is wonderful! I&#x27;m sure most people would get great results, just not me.</li>
    <li> The cost is good, but, if you have sensitive skin like me its not that great.  This product caused me to break out every time I used it. I went through half a tube of it and decided to find something different.</li>
    <li> Did the ingredients change or what? I have used this same product before on my face and it did wonders removing my acne scars. However now after purchasing second tube off from amazon.com and using Alpha Hydrox souffle for three weeks,  I feel it is not working on my skin anymore. Will update again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Have been using this for 5 years and love it.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and this works wonderful.  I do use other Alpha Hydrox as well and very pleased with this line.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have acne-prone skin with some fine lines, and has not broken me out. . but more importantly I swear my fine lines are beginning to soften after only a few weeks of use:) You do need to apply moisturizer on top of this though as your skin just sucks it up. Some tingling upon application, so you KNOW it&#x27;s working! Great stuff. Don&#x27;t ever stop making this product Alphy Hydrox!!! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I used this way back in the day when AHAs were the new big thing. I didn&#x27;t pick it back up until about 6 weeks ago, and boy I could kick myself for not giving this stuff a fighting chance years ago. It really helped with acne, as well as reversing the beginnings of fine crow&#x27;s feet on my right eye, made spots fade... it&#x27;s hard to believe this is my skin. One jar looks like about a 3 month supply, so one purchase will be enough for you to decide if it&#x27;s for you or not. If you&#x27;re acne prone and wary of putting a cream on your face, this is not greasy, but your skin will not really be dry, either. This is definitely worth a try for just about everyone.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this brand for 15 years now. It made my acne dry up and prevented (and even cured) wrinkles. Im 48 and have perfect, smooth skin of someone 18 years younger.  It used to be in just about every store, but sadly they all quit carrying it. Thank god I can buy it online.  Alpha hydroxy is the only thing that works. Especially if you have acne prone skin as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff burns so good! I can&#x27;t help but use it twice a day in conjunction with their other products in their line. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> This product makes a big difference in my face . I will continue to use it. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning before I apply moisturizer and primer.  I have been able to see an improved appearance in my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product when first starting a glycolic acid treatment. It doesn&#x27;t burn or leave me red. My teenager is using it too. She has lovely skin but get the once a month large pimple or too, and this has seemed to help control it. She makes sure to use it only once or twice a week and always wears a 15 spf moisturizer everyday (she uses Neutrogena&#x27;s Healty Skin) I use this a few times a week then once a week I use the 20% pads (at night though, because they do make me a little red) My skin is very soft since using alpha hydrox products! My skin is becoming more even in tone and my melasma on my forehead has faded dramaticaly! Make sure you wear at least a 15% spf  when you go outside though!!!!</li>
    <li> I have liked this product in the past and feel it is still a good product but there are other products that are better for me.  Nothing works for everyone and maybe the years have changed my skin so other things are better.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! At 12% AHA it is hard to find a non-prescription alternative to this! It keeps my skin super soft, and breakout free! I&#x27;ve gone without this and always go back. Hard for me to find, thank goodness Amazon carries it!</li>
    <li> I saw reviews many saying it worked good for them but unfortunately i didnt notice any difference. But definitely it is a good moisturizer. Maybe i need more glycolicacid percentage.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t really feel like the other products I used from this maker. I was kinda disapointed but no matter, I love what I got in place of it.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth, and non irritating, and it lasts, because you only need a small amount!</li>
    <li> Cured severe cystic acne that I battled for years. I have been using this product for 5+ years and I will NEVER live without it.</li>
    <li> I had such good luck with the Alpha Hyrdrox Retinol Resq that I wanted to try an AHA product.  This was so well reviewed, but, alas, it kept breaking me out and causing redness.  I have sensitive acne prone skin and kept this product up for a month because everyone said it would only break me out temporarily.  I finally gave it to a friend with dry skin who loves it and ordered myself the Oil Free version.  For my skin the oil free version is excellent--no breakouts, less redness.  Try this souffle if you are on the dry side, you&#x27;ll probably love it.  For those with oily or combo skin that are leery, don&#x27;t necessarily believe all those reviews that promise the breakouts will clear up.</li>
    <li> On some areas of my face, (like crows feet or forehead) it works wonderfully.  But I have extremely oily skin and when I use it directly under my eye it can cause the area to appear to have more wrinkles instead of less.  It does reduce the size of your pores as well.</li>
    <li> IT BROKE MY FACE OUT.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Oprah and decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve had acne and blemish prone skin for years, so I have a lot of little scarring and big pores.  For the past few months I&#x27;ve been using proactiv and found that made a huge positive difference, but it was only after I added this cream to my daily routine that a friend saw me and said my skin was glowing - she couldn&#x27;t believe I wasn&#x27;t wearing any extra make up.  I&#x27;m only 24, so I can&#x27;t say how this works on older skin, but I hope to keep mine in good shape for many years, and this seems like a good product for it.    It tingles and sometimes stings a little when you put it on, but it really does make your skin glow.  I wear it daily under my make up and so far so good.  Plus, the jar is generous and a little goes a long way - it will last you months!</li>
    <li> I have used AHA and Retin A for anti-aging/wrinkle prevention for 15 years. This product with the addition of 12% glycolic acid is fabulous. I love it! I&#x27;ve stopped using the Retin A since I started this product 10 mos ago. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or cause peeling like the Retin A does and it really makes the fine lines disappear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the new tube version of AHA Souffle. It has been reformulated and now has a different consistency that does not seem to absorb as well. It also leaves my skin feeling dryer than the cream version, which made my skin feel dewy for several hours after application. It also goes much faster, because you can&#x27;t as easily control how much you use. Accidentally squeeze a little too much, and you have to use it, because you can&#x27;t put it back in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you, Alpha Hydrox. You downgraded the best AHA product on the market.</li>
    <li> I read a review about this product and decided to try it. I love it!! My face looked wonderful. I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on and off for years.  It works for me.  My face is smoother and skin softer and the over all look much more bright.  I get seduced (ha ha who doesn&#x27;t) by cosmetic claims and I try the products but I seem to always come back to this one as my stand by. The other products are more expensive and actually don&#x27;t work as well for me.  I am going to stick with this one from now on. The price is right and it does what it says.  What more can you ask.</li>
    <li> This has improved my skin.</li>
    <li> excellent and very gentle...always wear sunscreen with it (an oil free one).</li>
    <li> have used a higher percentage of glycolic acid and done more extreme peels. i think my skin is desensitized, so this doesn&#x27;t even produce tingling on my skin, nor have i seen any results. product may work well for those with minor problems and relatively &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; skin, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin (52-yo filipina-american with melasma).</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. It helped smooth my skin out within two days. My skin felt silky and tight, but definitely not greasy. I will be re-ordering for sure.</li>
    <li> I loved the way it worked, I have tried many and this one works. Will for sure use it again.</li>
    <li> this is my first ever review on any product since i&#x27;ve tried nearly everything and it never worked. Im in my late twenties and one day i just woke up to breakouts on my cheeks and it never stopped. I&#x27;ve tried so many products and nothing really worked. I kept having bumps that becomes blackhead then pimples and it leaves horrible scars. finally i tried clinique that got it under control.. but still did get breakouts once in a while. I bought this to clear my scars but it actually stopped me from breaking out! Im 3 weeks pimples free ( never happened before!!! ) The scars are taking much longer but my face it soft , smooth and glowing. I only used in PM&#x27;s , now i am slowly using it in AM with Clinique SPF 25 over it.. Its my miracle.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this, and she swears by it.</li>
    <li> I try new products all the time in hopes of finding some holy grail... but this is it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years but tried something else because I was at the drugstore and was out of Alpha Hydrox, and my skin has looked awful.  Just ordered some more of this today.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I both use this cream as a night time treatment. Yes, it does burn for the first couple a minutes but you know it is working. We follow up with a soothing cream afterwards. After the first week of use we have both noticed a smoothing affect to our skin and continue to get results with longer use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than a year now and it is a regular to my beauty routine. I wash my face at night, put on a eye moisturizer, and than put this product on my face. Remember to wash your hands when your done, bc this product can stain your towels and pillow case. I started using this product with a lower AHA level and then moved up to this % when I thought my skin could handle it (sometimes my combo skin can be sensitive). My skin looks healthy with a glow in the morning, and I believe better in the morning than at night bc of this product. I recommend this product to someone looking for smoother skin without grease or irritation.</li>
    <li> My wife isnt sure its doing anything but said shes not sure if she has used it long enough.</li>
    <li> Great product it makes your skin feel really soft and smooth, another product that I will keep reordering. I like this much better than other products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years at night.  It feels good and isn&#x27;t to weak or strong.  The price is reasonable and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t meet products high standards EVOO would have the same affect. For the price one should expect more. I do not like it.</li>
    <li> Nice product, I thought a little pricey for small amount</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one a day for a little over 2 months and I must say my skin hasn&#x27;t looked better!  I had hyper-pigmentation from acne and a little melasma, but daily use of this (under sunblock!) really evened out my skin tone!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and always will.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore, though.  It shrinks my pores, smoothes my skin, exfoliates, gets rid of fine lines.  I&#x27;m 59 years old, with really great skin, in part because of this product.  Realy!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I was getting a lot of acne (age 26) recently. I work on a production floor that is very hot and makes my face oily. This product cleanses very deep and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like the cleansers with alcohol.    I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial cleansers which contain alcohol and salyclic acid but they all dry your face out and produce more acne. The only product with salyclic acid that I have found to work is St Ives apricot scrub. Use alpha hydrox for the morning and night and use the apricot scrub once a day.     MOISTURIZE your face at night. You might think it will clog up your pores and create more acne, but it doesn&#x27;t. Just make sure you use a good facial moisturizer. It will make your skin look healthy.    DRINK WATER. Try it. Staying well hydrated moisturizes you skin naturally and cuts down on acne aside from the other health benefits of staying well hydrated.    1. Wake up, quick shower, use alpha hyrdox, moisturize face  2. Come home from work, quick shower, use apricot scrub.  4. Before bed light wash with alpha hydrox  5. Moisturize face  6. DRINK LOTS OF WATER THROUGHOUT THE DAY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about 3 months now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I started getting acne when I got pregnant 11 years ago. I wasted money on many products that never seem to work. I even spend thousands of dollars doing peels, microdermabrasion and buying the expensive products that the spa and dermatology sells along with department stores and pharmacy products. This souffle get rid of my acne and brighten my skin. Not sure how it works on wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have much to begin with. I love this product so much that I went on their website, bought their toner, 14% aha swipes and night replenishing cream (moisturizer). Best choice I&#x27;ve made in my skin care routine and I&#x27;m saving a lot of money. Good bye $109 Chanel moisturizer, hello $10 moisturizer that works just as good if not better. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I alternate this product with another night cream, it does absorb   into skin and one can feel that mild tingle, I feel that it is working  maybe to early for results, I do not use it during the day. Will now   start continuous nightly use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a month ago and am finally seeing results. After washing my face with the 4% Panoxyl with my Clarisonic, I get out of the shower, dry my face, and immediately apply the Souffle. It does sting a bit but that gets better with time. I let it sit for a couple minutes then apply Duac (benzoyle peroxide). This routine has really helped my skin and I have pretty much no pimples except for the occasional small few. This is a HUGE improvement in my skin.   My routine:  Morning  -Wash with Alpha Hydrox foaming cleanser with Clarisonic  -Apply Oil Free Alpha Hydrox Serum   Night  -Wash with Panoxyl 4% with Clarisonic  -Apply Alpha Hydrox Souffle  -Apply Duac  Again, my skin is clearer and I&#x27;m working on fading red marks I have.</li>
    <li> Time to time I get those annoying itchy patches and pimples on my skin. I am guessing it&#x27;s somehow connected to hormones. I&#x27;ve heard that using products with AHA helps to exfoliate and dry up the skin a bit, therefore clearing it up. And guess what, it worked. It took about 3 days of use of this cream to get my skin under control. Have to mention that if you have any scratches or broken pimples on your skin, this cream will burn quite a bit. But only for a couple of minutes, really. So, it&#x27;s not as soothing as the name suggests.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 days now and I am pleased with it. Just wished it had more natural ingredients. My skin is clearer and smoother. Will see what happens before my next period.</li>
    <li> I like how this makes my skin feel.  Recommended by my dermatologist!</li>
    <li> It works good.  It works just fine as advertised-not much else can be said about something that works good--it is fine product</li>
    <li> The glowing reviews about this product are accurate in a sense - yes, this product shows a noticeable improvement in the appearance of skin over a short period of time.  It does contain enough glycolic acid at a decent ph, it does exfoliate well.  Whatever praises people bestow are germane but only to a certain degree.  The fact of the matter though is that the entire line of products contain many unefficacious artificial ingredients at best and downright harmful toxins, in effect, at worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has plenty of potential but does not deliver.  It seems to me that the makers are not truly interested in answering the riddle to great skin.  It is a start devoid of middle or end notes.  It does not cater to the skin as a complete system.  It will give you a minor improvement and waste a lot of your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t take my word for it, try it for yourself.  If you love it and are happy good for you.  I will not throw cigarette buds on anyones Eden.  If however you are not a believer like me and want to try another alternative try something with ONLY natural ingredients.  Anything else and your skin will be in a constant battle with adversaries you put there, everyday, and leave there to do damage, because it&#x27;s absurd to think that the body could assimilate such artificiality in any positive long-term way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choice is yours my friends.</li>
    <li> Used the entire tube. Loved it. it was smooth and smooth. Yes, it went on nicely.</li>
    <li> This is so nice and makes my skin smooth</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream now for one year. It is the best cream that I used so far. I used to have oil and acne skin and after one year I am pretty satisfy with the results. You can see the results after like two weeks and it goes better and better with use...People say that my skin looks amazing! Now, if you have very dry skin, you should try this product,  but instead of souffle version, would work better the cream version. Soufflé for oil skin - Cream for drie skin...You can not be wrong with that!</li>
    <li> Very mild sting and I don&#x27;t like the smell (I&#x27;m very, very sensitive to odors) but my skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt the next morning.  This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne before and am starting to develop wrinkles and sun spots. However using a glycolic acid product like this one has really refined my skin and made it look as if I get facials.  However people should expect that it does cause breakouts initially which is normal and goes deep into the skin&#x27;s layer to bring up and out excess dirt-hence the breakouts.  But one you are over that small bump in the road it&#x27;s smooth sailing. I was introduced by a dermatologist to the world of glycolic acid products but also fooled into paying almost $60 for a similar product in the Doc&#x27;s office. I said never again and this stuff works just as good as the dermatalogist&#x27;s high priced items.  Both my mother, sister, and boss/co-worker have started using it too after asking if I was wearing makeup one and and I said no. They commented on how nice my skin looked after I had been using this product and they have been buying it since.</li>
    <li> For the price and effectiveness of the product, it&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists over the years, but nothing helped me as much as this product does. My skin texture has improved and I don&#x27;t break out as much, either. My only quibble is on the instructions, it says to apply to your neck as well, but my skin there is very sensitive, so I don&#x27;t. I will be sure to order more when I run out and I&#x27;ll be sure to check out their other products. Product also shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> I am 58. I have been accused of being my son&#x27;s girlfriend -- solely on the basis of my skin. I have been using La Prairie Cellular Radiance for the last nine years. I am a registered nurse -- it was another RN who introduced me to La Prairie via a fabulous Nordstrom facial special. Many times, I have tried different, cheaper, well-known and less effective moisturizers; all with the result of minor to major breakouts. Then I saw a review of AHA Souffle on MakeUpAlley.com and sent for the cheapest jar. I started to use it after my shower and before my La Prairie Cellular Radiance Cream. What a miraculous cream. NEVER has my skin looked this fabulous. No wrinkles, my age spots are fading (they used to be cute little freckles), and acne scars are fading fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year now and my skin looks great! I&#x27;m 47 so you know ladies most products don&#x27;t stand up to wrinkles. This face soufflé works! I love it, I use it every night.</li>
    <li> One weird thing  though is that now the cap is red and not silver anymore. However, the content is the same.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for getting dead skin off of your face. It works really well - I like to put it on in the AM and then follow with Retin-A in the PM after washing my face before bed. It works wonders for discoloration or retinoid-induced flaking.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh. This is a miracle cream! It completely eliminates the little bumps that are all over my forehead (clogged pores I think), softens fine lines over time, reduces the appearance of pores, and is quite affordable. It is not scented and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all. A+.</li>
    <li> I have to report that i too have had positive results with this product and as others have mentioned  do follow up with my own moisture blend (shea and aloe) it has made my skin pretty clear in a very short  period of time (1 week) and some scaring (shaving bumps smoothed out)  i had from shaving has lessened tremendously. i am very satisfied and hope that my skin will continue to improve.</li>
    <li> so far, really great product. My skin feels smoother, finer and my dark spots seem to be a bit lighter. I did get a TUBE instead of the jar that is displayed. I was a bit annoyed with that but I guess it&#x27;s new packaging and I got the same ounces I paid for. My only issue with this is that the smell is not so great. It smells like medicine/plastic. I know that sounds gross but it kinda does. If you can stand the subtle smell, go for it.</li>
    <li> I love the way my face looks.  I am a 60 year old and thought I needed a Face lift.  The more I use this product - the better I feel about myself.  [[ASIN:B000G8LWZI Alpha Hydrox 12% Glycolic AHA Souffle-1.6 oz]]</li>
    <li> I get asked all the time what skin cream I use. This is a main staple in my daily routine. I use this, then sunscreen. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s just a fantastic product, and I could not be more pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it works.  Just remember to use sun screen.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be impressed with expensive price tags and promises that are appealing.  I love Alpha product line and it is always part of my regimen.</li>
    <li> After using it for over 3 months, I can&#x27;t report any noticeable change in skin&#x27;s texture/completion. Not reordering.&lt;br /&gt;I did feel a little tingling after application in days I had had used an exfoliator prior to this, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that will cure my dry, chapped, flakey  skin.  It works wonders on everything from face to feet and dry chapped hands and elbows.  I used to get it at a local drug store, but they stopped carrying it.  I can&#x27;t imagine why!  My patronage alone should have kept it in stock!</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time, i could tell a difference in less than a wk. does exactly what it says</li>
    <li> It worked okay for the price but Glytone and Obagi work a lot better for me (I have fair skin with sun damage).</li>
    <li> I tried it almost a week. A red swollen spot appeared under both eyes. Will throw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> One of my friends have the skin condition called rosacea. I read AHA lessens the symptoms of it and immedeately bought this cream for her. It really does work as a symptomatic solution.</li>
    <li> It gave me a few breakouts on my cheeks so I am not that impressed.  I know there is supposed to be a purging stage but I really don&#x27;t believe that a good products make you worse before they make you better.  Good products correct the wrongs and improve the skin with continual use.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I apply it under my moisturizer at night and my skin is so smooth in the morning. It&#x27;s priced right and will never stop using it. FYI: If you do happen to break out from this product at first, it&#x27;s because your skin is being exfoliated from the AHA. Continue using it and you&#x27;ll see your pimples diminish and your skin will become soft and smoother. That is, unless you could be allergic to the product.</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old and absolutely delighted with result.  After first use I was a bit concerned as my skin was red and a bit &amp;#34;spotty&amp;#34; looking next day but I realised this was just dead skin cells shedding and in 4-5 days my skin was looking better and felt softer than it had done in years.  I will probably now only use weekly or twice weekly now but it did exactly what I wanted for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s cream based as opposed to oil, which I need for VERY oily skin.  Also, smoothed out some bumps and rough skin on my forehead and neck within days.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I think it is working. It is hard to evaluate skin products as they do not work overnight. But this is certainly affordable and natural as opposed to all the other expensive supposedly miracle in a jar products that do not work any better no matter what celebrity endorses it. A good value.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff!!!!! i get so many compliments on my skin and it has mostly to do with this product. if i get break-outs, they heal within 2 days as opposed to a week. it can dry skin out if you&#x27;re sensitive, but once your skin is used to it, you will glow!</li>
    <li> This product along with Source Naturals Hyaluronic Serum and Source Naturals Cream have greatly improved my skin. I don&#x27;t think it has looked this good ever before. I am extremely happy with it and the price is reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I put this on every morning after I wash my face. I then shave with this on. I can feels the cream revitalizing my skin.Plus I get a close shave because it serves as a lubricant. I then put a moisterizer with some after shave and my skiin feels &amp; looks great!   I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I used this product for approximately two months and did not notice any reduction in wrinkles at all.  My face became much more sensitive and red, especially under the eyes.  The skin under my eyes also became dry and itchy.  I am surprised this product is receiving such high ratings.</li>
    <li> Just ok.  Not bad but not fantastic.  If one can get a trial sample somewhere would definitely do the trial before investing in the whole amount</li>
    <li> OK, but it must have some secondary ingredients that buffer the action of the acid because it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate nearly as well as the 10% enhanced lotion.  Unfortunately, that lotion has parabens in it, so I won&#x27;t be using it anymore, either.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my dermatologist recomended. Easy to use, light scent that is not obvious. Quick results.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 30s with fair skin and adult onset acne. I have started using the souffle about three months ago and have seen great results in not only significant reduction of break outs, but also in the way old scars and spots fade and become less visible. I should say that this product does take a couple of weeks to get used to as it did leave my skin stinging just slightly after application at first and I did see some redness. However, as the instruction leaflet says these do go away. Some people may find it helpful to use every other day at first, which is what I did. I now use the face wash from this line and the lotion which I use on my body every now and then, not daily. I do see that my skin looks brighter and more radiant. I am very happy with having finally found a product that works. Just do not forget to use a sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPD: The product no longer comes packaged as described. I attempted to receive what&#x27;s pictured twice, and had to return it twice. The souffle used to come in a JAR, but only comes in a TUBE now. For those who don&#x27;t like creams in a tube (I don&#x27;t because a lot more of it is wasted as it is impossible to squeeze out exact amounts and pointless to get whatever little is left when the tube is almost empty) this is a point to consider. Amazon needs t change product description and picture. Switching to 10% cream from this line as it is available in a jar.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews. But this product deserves it! I love it! I heard about it from Dr. Oz and I would usually use over the counter products like Revlon anti-wrinkle. But I am glad to say this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> This lotion really helps keep my skin looking clear.  I have melasma and it is the best lotion I have found to keep it at bay - it even beats out prescription hydroquinone, which I have used for years.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews I was excited to try this product. I was disappointed. It made my skin super oily and my already mild acne way worse. I stuck with it for about a month hoping but finally I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and my skin has already improved since I stopped. If u already have oily or acne prone skin I do not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like this souffle. It stung on the first application but over time has stopped stinnging. My skin has a more even skin tone now after using for a month. Cool product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products along this same line, I&#x27;m 41 and have minor signs of aging around my eyes and forehead.  I see noticeable improvement around my eyes and improvement on my forehead as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used glycolic acid products for years.  This one is the best. Doesn&#x27;t sting. It brightens and smoothes out the skin pigments. Takes a few weeks to see results.</li>
    <li> I use it to help keep menopausal acne at bay. Works.it keeps my skin hydrated and helps it heal. Not drying or irritating..</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product. But I just couldn&#x27;t. Let me start by saying that this product broke me out. I have acne prone skin but I don&#x27;t always get bad break outs (not since I was twelve, anyway). This product made me break out a lot. It was mainly on my chin, but every now and then I would break out on my forehead and cheeks. I wasn&#x27;t too worried because I researched this product and many people have said that it breaks you out at first. Kind of like it&#x27;s purging your skin of toxins. So I was ok with the break outs. This product did seem to help the break out heal afterwards. I would get a huge pimple and after using the product the pimple would get smaller. The main problem I had with this product was that it made my face really red! I looked like I had a sun burn. It was not an attractive look. I read that product made you sensitive to the sun, so I was wearing sunscreen, but the sunscreen didn&#x27;t not seem to help. My face was really red and nothing I did seems to help. I had to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all the amazing review I read, I wish this would have worked for me. Maybe my skin is too sensitive for this product. If you are think I about buying, I suggest you try it. It may not have the same effect on others as it did not me. Just make sure you put on sunscreen. Maybe it will work differently on you.</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews, and thought...okay, I will give it a shot. I am 30, fair caucasion, who gets hormonal acne and I have started to notice fine lines, and my pores. I have been using this for almost two months now, and within one week of using this every day, I noticed dramatic results. The lines around my eyes are gone, GONE. The pores are contracted, there is a general smoothness, and that glow is there like others mentioned. I have never been the type to have that perfect porcelain skin, but this definitely makes me feel better about what I do have. I have had one bout of an outbreak of acne since using it, but it was my fault, I got lazy. I highly recommend this product. One more note, I have sensitive skin leaning more towards the dry end of the spectrum, and this did NOT bother it at all. I was waiting for that one, since some people said initially there may be irritation. NONE.</li>
    <li> I decided to go the whole 9 yards and try the foaming face wash + 12% souffle + the moisturizer. Just so you know, my skin problems are: Excessively oily skin (need two blotter sheets every hour); uneven skin tone; and clogged pores (disgusting little oil plugs peaking out, some enlarged pores and then those tiny little bumps where the oil plug hasn&#x27;t hardened yet). I saw immediate results with these products in term of the oiliness and clogged pores. I&#x27;ve only had to blot my face once a day since I started using this stuff - big difference over having to blot every hour.  The enlarge pores and the tiny bumps were greatly minimized. My skin looks  much smoother. I usually use Biore pore strips to remove the plugs so, it is hard to say exactly how effective Alpha Hydros is at getting rid of these. But I don&#x27;t seem to be developing them as quickly as I was before. Within a week, I saw a noticeable difference in my complexion - much brighter. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or zits, so I can&#x27;t comment on that. But those tiny little clogged pores have been spreading over my face since I was 10! This is the only thing I&#x27;ve used that immediately and consistently improved the condition and appearance of my skin (and the my oiliness) without over drying my face. My skin is actually very supple. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s only been a week. I still have yet to see what the ultimate result will be--but looks promising so far.</li>
    <li> This stuff...WOW. I have been only using once every two days (for about a month) and the melasma that I got as a push present (thanks, kids!) is almost completely gone. The old acne scars from picking two very annoying chin blemishes are GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing. Cheap, effective and easy. Will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> You definitely feel tingling and a slight to moderate stinging shortly after applying the cream. My face started looking healthier and more radiant within a few days after first using. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the fine lines on my forehead seem to be decreasing....YIPPEE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, be sure to heed the warnings about avoiding your lips or you&#x27;ll end up with severely chapped lips like me, and always follow-up with sunscreen before going out in the sun.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 60&#x27;s, have glowing skin with very few wrinkles. This cream works for me...evens tone, keeps skin silky &amp; flawless. Why pay more? AHA&#x27;s work beautifully for many skin types, try it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> After reading the raving reviews, I decided to give this a try! I wanted to see if it would even out my skin tone since I did have some lingering scars from an acne battle I had in the past. After a couple nights of using this product, my face was so irritated and my chin began to break out like crazy. It looked like a had braille across my entire chin. The breakout area hurt and it was so dry, I was shocked. I decided to stop putting it on a night and went through my nightly regime as normal and my chin is starting to clear up. I really wanted to like this product but I think the product was just to harsh for my face. I&#x27;m happy it works for some people, oh well, the hunt continues!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months and I noticed my pimple scars are fading and my skin has become softer and brighter. I will buy more, highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing for the price point. My skin is clearer, glows and I do not get near as many pimples as would pop up prior to me using this product. It is a gentle exfoliant, my skin did sting a little bit when I first started using it, but the sensitivity is subsiding with continued use.</li>
    <li> I use another very expensive alpha hydroxy acid, so I had little hope for this one.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was surprised.  This product really works and will save me $100 bucks a month!  Thank you Alpha Hydroxy!!</li>
    <li> Really great product. I&#x27;m 28 and have been using it semi-regularly at night for about 1 1/2 months. My skin is so much brighter and softer, it&#x27;s lessened my dark spots from a patch of acne and really improved the texture of my skin. It does sting/tingle a bit a first and there is a period of &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; so some pimples might come to the surface but after that it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I didn&#x27;t know about this product before. I have had acne for 10 years now and like most people with this problem, I tried countless product and I spent a lot of money. Sometimes I find something that works for a while and my face would clear up and then it stops working. Then I became allergic to Benzoyl Peroxide and salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Any one who suffers from this problem knows what it feels like, when you look like crap, you feel like crap. I was so depressed. I spent a lot of time online looking for a solution and few months ago I read about glycolic acid. I went to Amazon right away and saw this product. I read the reviews and I bought it 2 months ago. I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review. Some reviewers wrote that they saw results in a few days, I thought that is not possible, but they are right. The first night I used it, when I look in the mirror the next morning my face looked so much better. Every morning I would look in the mirror and be amazed at how good my face look. I have not had anymore zits since I started using this product. And my skin is more even toned. I have very dry, sensitive skin but that is not a problem, I use moisturizer. My friend saw me the other day and ask what I am using because my face look so smooth. She made me order one for her. OMG I am so happy I found this product, I will never stop using it, I hope it keeps working. I feel so much better and I have one less thing to worry about.</li>
    <li> I have adult onset acne. I have had it for over a decade. Nothing would cure it. Benzyl peroxide makes me break out worse and rash up. &gt;2% salicylic acid spot treatment products help, but nothing really evened everything out and made the acne start to go away. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a miracle, but it certainly is the only thing that I have found in the past 10 years that works (and yes I have seen 3 dermatologists for this issue with no permanent resolution).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Routine:&lt;br /&gt;I apply this glycolic product 1x at night and a light face moisturizer 1x in the morning (plus an eye cream when I remember). I started seeing immediate results within less than 2 weeks. I also, after reading so many scarey reviews about negative product interactions, am happy to report that I had NO additional breakouts with the product and only light tingling for the first few minutes of application. I would compare this tingling to the feeling you get just after applying a witch hazel cotton pad (for those with pain concerns regarding the &#x27;tingle&#x27; reported by others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding Results 2 Weeks In:&lt;br /&gt;For those of us that have had long term acne and know how good we look in summertime (due to the sun hiding your acne spots) this is how I feel now, two weeks later, when I see myself in the mirror. I don&#x27;t know how well it will treat these recesses (old acne scars) I have in my cheek area, but the red splotches are gone and skin tone has evened substantially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also should be honest and say that the use of a glycolic product was recommended to me from my identical twin sister (yay for matching DNA and two people trying to solve the same problem at once). Anyways, she used a similar AHA product for a year (not this one exactly). However, her acne, red splotches, break outs, and scars are completely gone after 1 year of use of an AHA glycolic product. After seeing her results I thought I would find a similar product to try. (keeping fingers crossed over this year!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opinion Section:&lt;br /&gt;I saw a number of negative reviews. In reflection, I would suspect that sensitive youth skin may not benefit as much from this product as adult skin. I noticed that the product is far less drying on my face than advertised by others. Heck, I don&#x27;t even bother to moisturize at night and have no ill over-drying effects. However, I worry that if you are purchasing the product for &#x27;oil control&#x27; or have much oil production on your face this may aggravate your acne situation. I only comment this because when I get up in the morning I can still feel this product on my face - it&#x27;s not greasy or oily, I just feel a sheen. This could explain some of the negative posters comments. In my experience, I think youth acne needs drying more than adult acne, which needs exfoliation. If you are in your mid 20s and up (and DO NOT have sensitive, oil - prone, raging hormone youth skin), then this product is relatively inexpensive and delivers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: If there is a youth out there that has the opposite of this experience, please flag this (if this review section will allow it) to remove this last paragraph for accuracy as i do not want my speculation to mislead people on a product that is in my opinion, from first hand experience, absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> For some reason this line doesn&#x27;t work for me. I tried the cleanser two years ago and it made my skin break out. After reading the reviews for the moisturizer I decided to give the brand another shot. Bad idea. I looked like I had a sunburn, in addition to breaking out. On the plus side, it did make my skin softer but other moisturizers can do that too. I&#x27;m sure this product works well for others but it&#x27;s not for everyone. Proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 37 year old Mom with oily fair skin. I&#x27;ve been trying for years to find a product that will clear up my skin.  My Mom owns a salon and day spa so I&#x27;ve tried over the counter, prescription and spa products. Nothing has been as effective as alpha hydrox lotion and/or the souffle.  Not only has my skin cleared up, but my fine lines have almost disappeared.  I just recently switched to the souffle and I find it to be even better than the alpha hydrox lotion.  I also use the retinol night rescue at night before I put on the souffle.  So that may be helping with the acne and fine lines as well.  The foaming face wash is a great mild cleanser too. However, I find it doesn&#x27;t remove all of my eye makeup sometimes but probably because it is a mild cleanser.  The cost of these products is very reasonable too!!  Be warned, you will notice a tingling sensation after putting on the alpha hydrox lotion or souffle. This is normal and it means the AHA is working.  Also, be careful if you use a daily cleansers with exfoliating beads or other grainy ingredient.  The AHA is naturally taking off some of that superficial dead skin on the top layer. If you use an exfoliating cleanser daily plus the alpha hydrox lotion or souffle, you could be stripping away too much skin and your skin can become very irritated and possibly break out more. Best to use a mild cleanser when using AHAs and use an exfoliating type cleanser once a week.  Good luck and hope you like this product line is much as me!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a very long time and it is amazing...However, I suggest that if you purchase that it is fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin, and some eczema. My face broke out after use, and left dark spots.  I did continue to use their face wash that did not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Check out the key ingredients and compare to your favorite expensive facial creams. It&#x27;s the acids that do all the work on fine lines and skin texture, and this product has an exceptionally high amount of the ingredients that matter. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, creamy product.  Doesn&#x27;t make skin feel dry like some AHAs.  I would recommend it.  Not sure if AHAs in general do much good though.</li>
    <li> This was my usual glycolic acid cream.  Was, because I just bought a Dr Denese product  at three times the price, and comparable results. Once I use up the Dr Denese, I&#x27;ll be right back to using this product.  The Dr Denese product has to be used at night, and it leaves the face too tacky to use during the day time.  The AHA souffle easily mixes with my other daytime creams, sinks right into the skin and you can apply makeup over it without any problem.  I miss my Souffle!</li>
    <li> I started using this in high school. Granted I&#x27;m only 22 and I don&#x27;t have many serious wrinkles except for my 11s between my eyebrows and my forehead is just starting to wrinkle. A little goes a long way for me since I have sensitive skin. I only dab a finger tip&#x27;s worth over my forehead, neck, and chest. If I put it on my cheeks it will make me break out. Go figure. My skin feels smoother in the morning. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used this product line for years and love it. Keeps my skin young (within reason, of course).</li>
    <li> I tried it but it was a bit heavy.  I usually buy the lotion which is lighter to apply.</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago pre-kids, and decided to try it again.  Love it.  Makes my skin very clear, and love that they changed the packaging to be more hygenic.  Can&#x27;t beat this price for an AHA product.  Makes me want to try other products by this brand -- anyone try them and recommend another one?</li>
    <li> works great ... removes the dry and old skin ... gives  a fresh and new look to facial skin</li>
    <li> good for smoothing skin</li>
    <li> Keep your face smooth</li>
    <li> I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products. My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> I have had bad skin since I was younger. At 33 years old, I have tried everything for my acne and oily skin. You would never catch me without make-up on. I have always been embarrassed of my skin. I have been using Alpha Hydrox for 1 month now. My skin did breakout at first, but after a couple of weeks..... clear skin. Woo Hoooo! My skin is so soft now, my scars are lighter. I can now skip foundation. My skin is still oily, I&#x27;m not complaining. I now have the clear soft skin I used to be envious of. I wish they would have had this cream years ago:)</li>
    <li> I use this at night. I&#x27;m 46 and have had some fine wrinkles and dull skin. This moisturizer helps to brighten my skin and diminish fine wrinkles. It does sting sometimes but goes away fairly quick. Great price. I have ordered it twice and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Use this in morning and Neutrogena Healthy Skin at night and your skin will be a dream.  Smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> I think it helps keep my skin clear and moist.</li>
    <li> Great AHA moisturizer for a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy--especially under my makeup. All of the Alpha Hydrox products are great.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Seems to be a quality product. My skin breaks out easy and so far no problems  I do see a slight difference in my skin after 1 week.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about this product and decided to go ahead and buy it. I have been using it for a week, only at night and my skin just glows. I have had no adverse reaction like others though I have problem skin, I still break out, so I think this will help my skin a lot. Its not greasy, very light and one needs very little. The tube is easy to carry for traveling. I normally do not write reviews so soon but I can already tell the difference it has made to my skin and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> The price was right. The service was excellent. I received the product within three days of placing my order. The product was okay. It&#x27;s moisturizing, but it stings. I thought the stinging would lessen with use, but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not a wimp and can usually tolerate some discomfort, but the stinging/burning from this product I found very unpleasant. I had hoped to see some improvement on wrinkles, especially on the drivers side of my face, but I noticed none.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products but this after one use ad softened fine lines. I had be careful how long I left it on my neck because it turned red. It&#x27;s strong which is great!  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-30&#x27;s with combination/oily, fair, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year &amp; strongly recommend it to everyone. At first I had to use it only once a week until my skin adjusted to it (took a few weeks), now I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the AH  Foaming Face Wash, and love both.  As I said in my other reviews, these products are not harsh at all, but have made a definite improvement in the texture and evenness of color on my face and even somewhat on my neck (turkey neck).  I plan to continue using them!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that I can see working! I love this stuff. I have tried a lot of AHA&#x27;s that tingle too much and I can&#x27;t stand them, but this one does the job of getting rid of all of the flakes on my face and it only slightly tingles. The pH in this product is perfect and actually allows the AHA&#x27;s to do their job where most other products on the market have the wrong pH. I was happy to see that when I got this it was not the jar packaging (as shown) but the tube which keeps the product more stable.  I already put it on my list to reorder. Oh and a little goes a long way! It spreads really well. My flakes were gone in about 3 uses with no excess oil which is great because I am strangely super oily as well as super flaky. A conundrum I know.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm to totally erase my fine nasolabial lines from smoking. I&#x27;ve been a smoker for twenty something years.  Now in my late 30s , I needed a quick fix for my facial lines and dark circles under my eyes from smoking. I bought this product and used it in conjunction  with the alpha hydrox foaming facial wash and hyaluronic acid serum and triple virgin Argan oil. Let me tell you , my skin is like brand new !!!  I have ZERO fine lines and ZERO dark circles !!! You cannot tell that I am a smoker. I smoke almost a pack a day.  My skin is literally glowing and radiant. Extremely pleased !!!</li>
    <li> So, I wanted to wait a week before I posted my review. I felt that would be enough time to see some minimal effects, and see how my skin reacted to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, as the product warned and from reading other reviews, it did sting a little after application. However, I have used AHA products before and have done glycolic peels, so I wasn&#x27;t bothered or surprised by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the fifth day, the stinging was only felt around my nose, and probably because I tend to have a heavy hand with any products I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles. I&#x27;m in my early 30s, but people always ask me if I&#x27;m in my 20s. My mom and grandmother also look quite young for their ages, so I may have some good genes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, that doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t try to do what I can (within my budget) to keep my skin looking the best it can. I have some old acne scars from years ago. I have done $800 peels with a dermatologist and such in the past and I didn&#x27;t notice life-changing results. Well, this product seems to make my skin look softer, and it gives it a glow it doesn&#x27;t have when I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a week, I find that I like it a lot. I actually look forward to washing my face and putting in on. I just ordered the face wash today because I like this product so much. I have some freckles on my nose and those look like they are fading. I&#x27;m going to keep using this product. The price is right, and I feel my results will continue to improve.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am a repeat buyer. The 10% formula seems to work well on my skin, I have the 14%&#x27;as well but only use for a few nights when I have problem areas. The cream helps remove the dead skin without scrubbing which for me is quite irrating.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks and feel it&#x27;s one of the most effective products (especially for the $$) that I have EVER used. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and had freckles/sun spots (I do stay away from the sun), some fine lines, red blotches, large pores and general lack of tone. I hadn&#x27;t neglected things, it just became harder to keep up. I knew I could spend big bucks and tackle the problems, but this has really done the trick! In that short time of daily use the lines around my eyes are completely gone, fine lines above lip are almost gone, and the freckles have faded so much so that I hardly use ANY concealer under makeup. My large pores are not even noticeable....even without makeup! Red blotches are ALL gone. I met someone last week that I hadn&#x27;t seen in about a year and her very first comment was the fact that I looked so young. She repeated it several times and then I realized that I had hit pay dirt by using this product!! I&#x27;m sold, reordering it now. And just think, I didn&#x27;t have to pay HUNDREDS of dollars for results! Oh yes, I do use Eucerin Daily Protection face lotion SPF 30 on top of it each day.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after having crazy acne in my mid-30&#x27;s.  After making my first-ever trip to the dermatologist at 35 and being prescribed a $200 medication, I knew I needed to find an alternative treatment.  After doing tons of research and reading many reviews for products on Amazon, I decided to try this product.  I had read several reviews that said you should give the product 3-4 weeks before making a judgment about whether or not it was working.  I am so glad I read those, because for a few weeks, I felt like my face was getting worse.  There were a few, frustrating breakouts after I started the cream, but by the end of the month, I was SOLD!  I tell all of my friends about this product!  Not only did it clear up my acne, but it makes my skin feel more hydrated and even softened the overall appearance of my skin!  I cannot say enough about this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It makes my skin so smooth. I actually use this over proactiv repairing lotion, and my skin has never been better. It helps get rid of those dry patches. However, if you are new to aha, please give this a few weeks for your skin to get used to this. It will be worth it. If you have sensitive skin, I would start with a lower percent aha.</li>
    <li> This product has been keeping my skin younger looking, I swear!  It has a mild stinging sensation but that&#x27;s just so you know it is working.  It&#x27;s very very mild, yet feels like it is actually removing dead skin cells and rejuvenating my skin.  I put on the Alpha Hydroxy AHA Souffle and then use the Garnier Ultra-Lift Pro Gravity cream over it to give myself a soothing, soft feeling.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Exceptional product.  Not greasy.  Does reduce wrinkles.  I use the Alpha Hydroxy for my face, have for years, and it does reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream, I used their lotion and was getting good results with it, but this is much better. My face feels so smooth and clear.It does a nice job of reducing the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong product so I haven&#x27;t actually tried this one.  I reordered.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with oily, acne-prone skin for the bulk of my teen and now adult years. I&#x27;m one of those people who often says I have &#x27;tried everything&#x27; because, well, it feels like I have. From Accutane and other prescription products to drugstore finds to high end creams, I haven&#x27;t left many stones unturned. All in my quest to curb an oily complexion that leads to acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first discovered the Alpha Hydrox brand by accident at my local Walgreen&#x27;s store while searching for new products. I purchased the Foaming Face Wash and the Enhanced Lotion, the two products carried in my local store. I quickly realized the lotion was too moisturizing for my oily skin, and purchased the Oil Free Formula instead. Believe it or not, it dried my skin WAY too much. So, I landed on the Souffle and haven&#x27;t look back since. For my skin type, it really is just right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash with the Foaming Face Wash twice daily and use the souffle afterwards each time. I typically follow up with a moisturizer of some kind, as my skin often feels a bit tight after using the Souffle. Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s regular moiturizer in the tub is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a major shift in my complexion after using the Souffle for the past 6 months or so. My acne has decreased significantly (I still get breakouts that time of the month, but that&#x27;s an unrelated hormonal issue) and the overall texture and tone of my skin is drastically better. So much so, that I am not embarrassed to leaave the house without makeup on for the first time in my life! I&#x27;ve never had good skin, but this product has made me feel (and look) like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 29 years old and often mistaken for a teenager--last week someone told me they thought I was 18 years old--and I believe my skin is a big part of that. And I now know it&#x27;s not because of my acne, either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful; take it from someone who has tried everything else!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Gives my skin a more youthful appearance by helping the exfoliation process along. Also this has a bit of moisturizer in it to soothe. I don&#x27;t have any reactions to aha. I use a light moisturizer after as well.</li>
    <li> My skin look like a baby&#x27;s skin. After 2 weeks using this product (twice a day)  the miracle comes, I saw the results;&lt;br /&gt;My dry skin dissapear, a couple of wrinkle too. I will never stop using Alpha Hydrox Soufle 12 P.G AHA.&lt;br /&gt;I am fascinated.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the high ratings and reviews. I used this product and I got hives and need to go visit my dermatologist to get my face checked out. If you purchase this product and you have sensitive skin or break out easy with new product test a small part before using. If I could post a picture of my skin it would scare anyone into being careful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I spaced on this review, but I did. Great stuff, along with being a really pure compound of a strong AHA, it manages to get a 12% dose of Glycolic Acid into my skin with no redness or puffiness. Although sold mainly as an Anti-Wrinkle, this AHA cream works on my adult acne where the Salicylic acid and Benzoyl peroxide based off the shelf products have failed. Great stuff!</li>
