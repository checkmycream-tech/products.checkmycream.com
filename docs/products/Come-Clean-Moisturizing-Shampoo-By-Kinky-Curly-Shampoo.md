      <li>This product cleans your hair without over drying and smells really great.</li>
      <li>lol...</li>
      <li>GOOD</li>
      <li>(also I wasn&#x27;t getting a lot of breakage which is surprising because i&#x27;m prone to breakage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m thinking this isn&#x27;t a good \\&quot;everyday\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Like many others said, it smells really great.</li>
      <li>I did and love it!  </li>
      <li>The Good:&lt;br /&gt;-It smells amazing...</li>
      <li>And honestly, the oil also helps strengthen my hair after I rinse out the shampoo.</li>
      <li>:) good stuff</li>
      <li>Still it&#x27;s a nice sulfate-free shampoo.  </li>
      <li>come clean, then use one of these really great mineral deposit build up removal shampoos:</li>
      <li>Before applying conditioner I noticed my locs felt super light, and I was impressed.</li>
      <li>the oil method would be more effective.</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo for natural hair.</li>
      <li>i have very fine, curly hair</li>
      <li>ugh i use my own or co-wash and the same great results!!!</li>
      <li>so products are very important to me.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I followed-up with the Knot today which I love.    </li>
      <li>I love this line.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>, it makes my hair feel so healthy.</li>
      <li>Not for winter use, that&#x27;s for sure</li>
      <li>However, I just realize that I am not quite sure if it removes mineral build up :0</li>
      <li>One of my staples for sure.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
      <li>My hair DID NOT feel like &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34;... instead, it made my hair feel thicker and squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>First of all let me say that I love the knot today and curling custard!</li>
      <li>It also works awesomely with the other products in the kinky curly line.</li>
      <li>So between getting it squeaky clean and smelling lovely</li>
      <li>b/c it cleanses well, and has smooth foamy lather.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it, for it to be effective.  </li>
      <li>It has c14-16 olefin sulfonate which is considered \\&quot;very harsh\\&quot; vs sulfate which is considered \\&quot;harsh\\&quot; on a popular curly hair website.  </li>
      <li>I have been relaxer free for 19 months.</li>
      <li>but for me it makes my hair feel squeaky clean</li>
      <li>It does leave the hair squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo was designed to clean from product build up.</li>
      <li>You still get that squeaky clean feeling without the dryness, and it got TONS of buildup off of my scalp.</li>
      <li>Although it is a moisturizing shampoo, I need to use a co-wash to give my hair that added moisture and not that squeaky clean feel.</li>
      <li>Come Clean...</li>
      <li>It just felt really clean.</li>
      <li>and I was right!  </li>
      <li>I love the light and fruity smell, which convinced me to go on and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed and conditioned like normal.</li>
      <li>Moreover, if you do need a good DE-mineral shampoo, I would recommend doing 1st, a simple apple cider rinse to start even with Kinky curly</li>
      <li>Gives my naturally curly hair a nice wave.</li>
      <li>Instead, it makes users believe it&#x27;s mild, and it&#x27;s not.  </li>
      <li>and I has to quickly condition it.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is good and when used with the conditioner and the curling custard it really makes my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>This product uses simple pronounceable ingredients and a nice clean scent that works well to help strip the hair of excess buildup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found a natural clarifying shampoo that gets the grime out!</li>
      <li>Has a pretty smell to it and gets my hair clean.</li>
      <li>SQUEAKY clean, to be exact.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-It makes your hair feel pretty clean</li>
      <li>This shampoo was great for taking all the heavy build-up out of my hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does not only  moisturize; smells amazing;</li>
      <li>Also if you are into the more natural shampoo like myself that is Sulfate &amp; Amine-free.</li>
      <li>comb goes right through.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s not an easy feat for my natural, kinky hair, but somehow they make it work.</li>
      <li>I read on the bottle that it was sulfate free, so I assumed it was mild, but once I washed my hair, it was really dry and squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>I used it for the first time on Saturday</li>
      <li>I bought this along with the rest of the three part system and ironically enough, I like this product the most.  </li>
      <li>Nothing works like this shampoo to get my curly hair back into shape after I&#x27;ve used too many products over time.</li>
      <li>Thier detangler in the other hand is amazing.</li>
      <li>and I did feel my hair was clean and didn&#x27;t strip its natural oils.</li>
      <li>this one I use only when my my scalp and hair are thick with product then thus works great!</li>
      <li>My hair is super soft &amp; shiny using this.</li>
      <li>This ingredient is on par with a sulfate, which is very misleading</li>
      <li>thinking about getting the whole line now</li>
      <li>I normally wash my hair in 4 sections and when using this product on the first section my hair was coming out by the chunks.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars despite that because I think I&#x27;ve found a (relatively) gentle clarifying shampoo that I can use every month or every six weeks.</li>
      <li>Used primarily as a detergent cleansing agent, but is potentially drying and irritating...\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>My hair was squeeky and seemed very thirsty for the coconut oil I put in it after shampooing.</li>
      <li>It cleans the hair really well.</li>
      <li>This is a very stripping shampoo, It makes my hair very dry but very clean.</li>
      <li>shampoo does clean, and I&#x27;m sure it cleans all the build up from other products, but if it&#x27;s a clearing shampoo, it should be advertised as such.  </li>
      <li>because your hair definitely &#x27;comes clean&#x27; after usage...</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to using this shampoo as it says mild enough for every day use.  </li>
      <li>Be especially careful if you have locs, clarifying them and making sure you get rid of buildup is important, but so is proper moisture.</li>
      <li>BTW I have blonde curly fine hair but lots of it, and this keeps the fine weight of my hair from being plastered down.</li>
      <li>Decent shampoo.</li>
      <li>I always find it helpful to saturate my entire head with thick oils (castor oil, coconut oil, and olive oil)(it&#x27;s kind of like a hot oil treatment).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to sulfate-free products</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo a couple years ago when it was still fairly new and just showing up in stores.  </li>
      <li>If you workout/sweat alot everyday then look into co-washing.. which safe enough for everyday use. :)</li>
      <li>This product smells great, and whereas I have used clarifying shampoos in the past they have left my hair feeling very dry and brittle afterward.</li>
      <li>In order to use any of the other products in this line, you must start with this shampoo if you want to get the full effect.</li>
      <li>However,I will email the company and get a clear answer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I do like this product. I used it for the first time on Saturday and I did feel my hair was clean and didn&#x27;t strip its natural oils. I used only a little and it lathered really well. I followed-up with the Knot today which I love.    I would recommend this product.    Overall rating: 5.0</li>
    <li> This was my only shampoo for awhile.  I like it b/c it cleanses well, and has smooth foamy lather.  Smells great!  It is not moisturizing, though.  I used it as a clarifier.  It does leave the hair squeaky clean.  All you need is one lather.  Still it&#x27;s a nice sulfate-free shampoo.  I don&#x27;t like that squeaky feeling, so I&#x27;d dilute mine.  Perfect!   You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it, for it to be effective.  I&#x27;d say no more than a quarter size for your whole head.</li>
    <li> I have recently went from a relaxer to a natural hair style. This shampoo was great for taking all the heavy build-up out of my hair. I did have to use the leave-in conditioner to put moisture back into my hair but it wasn&#x27;t heavy or sticky. My hair felt so clean and fluffy. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a very stripping shampoo, It makes my hair very dry but very clean. A little goes a long way because this lathers like crazy, I only use this for when I color my hair an unnatural color. Definitely not for everyday use for my 3b-c hair I may try another lather shampoo for when I color my hair but for now I&#x27;ll stick with this</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the rest of the three part system and ironically enough, I like this product the most.  It clarifies my hair gently but it doesn&#x27;t strip it to the point of my hair squeaking or leaving my scalp dry and tight.  I usually use it about once a month, give or take, so this bottle will last me about three years.  I will repurchase until she reformulates it.</li>
    <li> This product cleans your hair without over drying and smells really great. Dont hesitate to buy. It also works awesomely with the other products in the kinky curly line.</li>
    <li> *TIP FOR NATURALS!!**  Before I shampoo.. I always find it helpful to saturate my entire head with thick oils (castor oil, coconut oil, and olive oil)(it&#x27;s kind of like a hot oil treatment). The thick layer of oils PROTECT the hair shaft from the &amp;#34;harshness&amp;#34; of any clarifying shampoos. And honestly, the oil also helps strengthen my hair after I rinse out the shampoo. My hair DID NOT feel like &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34;... instead, it made my hair feel thicker and squeaky clean! (also I wasn&#x27;t getting a lot of breakage which is surprising because i&#x27;m prone to breakage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t recommend using this shampoo by itself... the oil method would be more effective. I have to wash my hair once every 2 weeks because I use a lot of products on my 3c/4a (medium porosity) hair. This product does EXACTLY what it says,, It&#x27;ll give your hair a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; start ..except I don&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use because this is a shampoo. If you workout/sweat alot everyday then look into co-washing.. which safe enough for everyday use. :)</li>
    <li> Nothing works like this shampoo to get my curly hair back into shape after I&#x27;ve used too many products over time. I am surprised at how much life comes back into my hair after I strip off old products with this shampoo. Now I would not use it every time I shampoo...this to me is a clarifying shampoo....but it does the job. BTW I have blonde curly fine hair but lots of it, and this keeps the fine weight of my hair from being plastered down.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and it works great!!! my hair felt clean and moisturized after shampoo with a small amount. thinking about getting the whole line now :) good stuff</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;-It smells amazing... just like mandarin oranges!&lt;br /&gt;-All of the botancial ingredients are organic&lt;br /&gt;-A little bit goes a long way...about a quarter sized amount is all I need for my mid back length 3b hair&lt;br /&gt;-It makes your hair feel pretty clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-It made my hair realllllllllly dry&lt;br /&gt;-It includes an ingredient called \\&quot;c14-16 olefin\\&quot; which is, according to cosmeticscops.com, \\&quot;...Used primarily as a detergent cleansing agent, but is potentially drying and irritating...\\&quot;. This ingredient is on par with a sulfate, which is very misleading&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product a 2 star rating because its use is not as advertised on the bottle. If I used it daily, my hair would feel like straw. However, as a once-a-month clarifying shampoo, I give it 4.5 stars.</li>
    <li> DRIES OUT HAIR! AS SOON AS I PUT IT IN MY HAIR IT WAS ROUGH AND TOUGH LIKE SAND PAPER!! I HAD TO CONDITION MY HAIR 3 TIMES FOR IT TO FEEL SOFT AGAIN, AND THEN DEEP CONDITION A FEW DAYS LATER BECAUSE IT WAS THAT ROUGH. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BY THIS. I USED IT BECASUE I HAD A LOT OF PRODUCT BUILD UP.   I HAVE 3A/3B HAIR</li>
    <li> This product uses simple pronounceable ingredients and a nice clean scent that works well to help strip the hair of excess buildup.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for natural hair. Have been using this for years. Tried others but keep coming back to this product.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo a couple years ago when it was still fairly new and just showing up in stores.  I normally wash my hair in 4 sections and when using this product on the first section my hair was coming out by the chunks.  Ordinarily I would get some shedding if I had not washed or detangled my hair in a while, but it had not been that long since I detangled last and my hair had never come out that easily.  I lost a lot of hair from that one section alone and knew this was not for me.  People, if you decide to use this product, please test it out on a small section first and know what is normal for your hair.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> First of all let me say that I love the knot today and curling custard! But the SHAMPOO is awful! I have 4a type hair and as soon as I washed it my head felt like someone was scrunching it up it got knotted and the feeling was just awful! However as I stated the KNOT TODAY is totally wonderful. But no stars for the shampoo i coudln&#x27;t even stand the feel of my hair after I washed with this shampoo....ugh i use my own or co-wash and the same great results!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars because it cleans your hair very well and a little goes along way but for me it makes my hair feel squeaky clean almost stripped like. Although it is a moisturizing shampoo, I need to use a co-wash to give my hair that added moisture and not that squeaky clean feel.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo today and its not moisturizing at all.My hair became literaly hard and brittle as i was shampooing it.It was worse than a dollar store shampoo.I like the other products in this line but this shampoo is terrible.</li>
    <li> Can be drying but it definitely cleans the hair of any build up.</li>
    <li> Living in Hawai&#x27;i and not having processed water, this shampoo strips all the minerals and residue off my hair. If not for the conditioner, it may be too harsh.</li>
    <li> because your hair definitely &#x27;comes clean&#x27; after usage...SQUEAKY clean, to be exact.  It smells great too...Hair is not easy to comb immediately after, but you have to use the knot today conditioner and it&#x27;s like magic.  your hair becomse liquid!  lol...comb goes right through.  that&#x27;s not an easy feat for my natural, kinky hair, but somehow they make it work.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo and it just felt like it stripped my hair. My hair was way too dry after use.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim while grocery shopping. I love the light and fruity smell, which convinced me to go on and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed and conditioned like normal. Before applying conditioner I noticed my locs felt super light, and I was impressed. The only time my hair has felt like since I got locs a year ago was when I did a apple cider vinegar soaking for 30 minutes before using a normal shampoo. So between getting it squeaky clean and smelling lovely I though I&#x27;d found a shampoo I could use every few days.&lt;br /&gt;The next day I felt my hair and it was very dry and crunchy, as if I hadn&#x27;t use conditioner. So I&#x27;m thinking this isn&#x27;t a good \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars despite that because I think I&#x27;ve found a (relatively) gentle clarifying shampoo that I can use every month or every six weeks. So, for every few days, this might be rough on your hair. Be especially careful if you have locs, clarifying them and making sure you get rid of buildup is important, but so is proper moisture. But I advise anyone on the hunt for a clarifying shampoo to give it a go.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great!  I love it. Some people said this shampoo made their hair hard. I have 3b/3c hair type. It cleans the hair really well. It&#x27;s not as harsh as other clarifying shampoos. In order to use any of the other products in this line, you must start with this shampoo if you want to get the full effect. I did and love it!  One week before I purchased this line of products I used Suave clarifying shampoo and my hair clumped together and I has to quickly condition it. I have been relaxer free for 19 months. When I used this shampoo my hair did not clump together. It just felt really clean. I love this line.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:40866111f760ebc00bcdfea4fb9b2934]] This a great clarifying Shampoo. However, I just realize that I am not quite sure if it removes mineral build up :0 I read the bottle again and it said that it removes product build up.Perhaps it do but I am stickler about wording. However, I have use this product for a couple of years and it has yet to fell me. However,I will email the company and get a clear answer. Moreover, if you do need a good DE-mineral shampoo, I would recommend doing 1st, a simple apple cider rinse to start even with Kinky curly come clean, then use one of these really great mineral deposit build up removal shampoos: Joico K-PAK Clarifying Shampoo, Paul Mitchell Clarifying Shampoo Three, or Redken Hair Cleansing Cream Shampoo for All Hair Types. Also if you are into the more natural shampoo like myself that is Sulfate &amp; Amine-free. DEA &amp; MEA-free. Paraben-free. Gluten-free. 100% vegan, you can use Moroccan oil Clarifying Shampoo or ClarpHx Clarify Shampoo. These products say directly that it helps remove mineral deposit build up.&lt;br /&gt;Also If you think you have or do have hard water I recommend Malibu Wellness Making Water Well Kit Hair Care Products. Great stuff&lt;br /&gt;Please check out My video on Kinky Curly Come Clean...It has yet to fell me and will update this review once I email the company and I get a reply back. I still give it 5 stars... Its that good!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is good and when used with the conditioner and the curling custard it really makes my hair soft.  While it does not technically contain any sulfates, it does have olefin sulfanate which can also be irritating.</li>
    <li> I agree it is drying and not moisturizing... it says its sulfate free which is not accurate... you will need to condition afterwards to restore moisture...I will continue to use it because I bought it at Target but I suggest diluting it with water and maybe apply a lite oil or conditioner  to hair prior to shampooing to help combat the dryness</li>
    <li> Like many others said, it smells really great. But this shampoo has to be one of the worst I have used in my hair. It&#x27;s on par with sulfate shampoos which makes my 3c/4a hair feel dry and synthetic. I even used conditioner to soften my hair before using it but the shampoo still made my once soft hair a dry corse mess. Will not use EVER again. Thier detangler in the other hand is amazing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was designed to clean from product build up. It will fry your hair if you use regularly because that&#x27;s not its intended use. I use this maybe once a month I have a different every week shampoo bit this one I use only when my my scalp and hair are thick with product then thus works great!</li>
    <li> i have very fine, curly hair so products are very important to me.  I&#x27;m new to sulfate-free products so I can&#x27;t compare this shampoo to anything :(  BUT I did like it...My hair is super soft &amp; shiny using this.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I would recommend it over and over. This shampoo does not only  moisturize; smells amazing; last for months because you need very little and lastly it is all natural. One of my staples for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  I have been using it for over 2 years now and panic if I run out.  I love it, it makes my hair feel so healthy.</li>
    <li> Starting a &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; treatment on my hair and needed to clean all the build up from tons of different products I&#x27;ve used before starting. As far as I can tell this did the trick. My hair was squeeky and seemed very thirsty for the coconut oil I put in it after shampooing. I&#x27;m glad to have found a natural clarifying shampoo that gets the grime out!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using this shampoo as it says mild enough for every day use.  This is NOT true.  I read on the bottle that it was sulfate free, so I assumed it was mild, but once I washed my hair, it was really dry and squeaky clean.  It just felt worse than my regular sulfate shampoo.  So I researched on the net and I was right!  It has c14-16 olefin sulfonate which is considered \\&quot;very harsh\\&quot; vs sulfate which is considered \\&quot;harsh\\&quot; on a popular curly hair website.  Google the name and you can see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does clean, and I&#x27;m sure it cleans all the build up from other products, but if it&#x27;s a clearing shampoo, it should be advertised as such.  Instead, it makes users believe it&#x27;s mild, and it&#x27;s not.  I don&#x27;t like deceptive advertising, so I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I used the shampoo and to my dismay my hair started to shed terribly.  I am natural and have been for five years; I know my hair and this product is a definite NO NO....</li>
    <li> THIS SHAMPOO SMELLS GOOD BUT I DONT LIKE IT BECAUSE IT MADE MY DAUGHTER HAIR EXTEREMLY DRY!!!!!!!!!! TANGLED!!!!!! AND FELT LIKE IT STRIPPED HER HAIR OF THE MOISTURIZER IT FELT LIKE I WAS RUNNING MY HAND THRU A HARD WET NAPKIN NOT SOFT AT ALL... WONT BE BUYING WAISTE OF 14.99</li>
    <li> Decent shampoo. Gives my naturally curly hair a nice wave. Has a pretty smell to it and gets my hair clean. Overall I am not amazed but I do like it</li>
    <li> It makes my hair too dry. Not for winter use, that&#x27;s for sure</li>
    <li> I initially bought this product because I was looking for a reasonably priced SFS (sulfate-free shampoo) that would cleanse without stripping my hair of all natural oils, as I am 3 years natural. This product smells great, and whereas I have used clarifying shampoos in the past they have left my hair feeling very dry and brittle afterward. this product does not dry out your hair. You still get that squeaky clean feeling without the dryness, and it got TONS of buildup off of my scalp. (always a plus). I recommend trying this product especially if you&#x27;re a natural who frequently co-washes or just need a shampoo that&#x27;s going to cleanse without stripping.</li>
