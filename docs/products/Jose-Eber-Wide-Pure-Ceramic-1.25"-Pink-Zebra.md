    <li> Not even worth one star! Jose Eber I received is a FAKE!!!!!!!  I was hesitant on purchasing online with all these scams going on,  but reading all the good reviews I figured ill give it a try because the price was so good and the picture posted online is a real one. I have other REAL Jose Eber styling tools that were bought from mall kiosks that work absolutely wonderful!! But are double almost triple the price. The moment I pulled it out of the brown box it was delivered in I knew it was FAKE! The lettering and design was different and the lettering on the tool also and of course it DID NOT work like a real Jose Eber!&lt;br /&gt;They did a good attempt coping the product and Im sure a lot others have been scammed if they are not familiar with real Jose Eber products.... still waiting on a refund!</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> Hello this product is excellent and thank you, you accelerated access was very fast I will recommend my friends, I thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;  This product is excellent</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hot and the weight is light on my hands. It makes the hair straight and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend for all ages.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a mall kiosk because it was time to replace my Chi (only because the cord became damaged). I decided to try this out because after telling the sales girl &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; 4 times I got a slightly better price than I would have paid for the Chi. I was initially impressed, but quickly realized that this flat iron sucked the moisture from the ends of my hair super quick leaving me with super dry, split ends ! I never had that problem using my Chi (which I&#x27;ve owned 2 Chi irons for well over 8 years combined). The next thing I noticed is that after only 4 months when I turned on the iron it would start to crackle and pop. There is a lifetime warranty, but with how horrible it has made my hair feel and how quickly the wiring has gone there is no way I&#x27;ll cash in on that. It does work a little quicker than the Chi, but for the negatives I&#x27;ve experienced I&#x27;ll stick with the brand I&#x27;ve had no problems with. Back to Chi I go!</li>
    <li> Excellent product is very stylish and is also very light and easy to use and the most important is the price a wonderful product for the price.</li>
    <li> What a great deal.  I bought the same one at the local county fair a few years ago and paid $150 and it stopped working so I wanted to replace it.  I was so thrilled to find this one that is EXACTLY the same only at a third of the cost.  I guess I over-paid the first time!  I like that you can straighten as well as curl.</li>
    <li> Always at my wife expectation, It&#x27;s really great and my wife enjoyed it very much.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I have really long hair and this curling iron works amazing! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> The plates are loose and do not heat as they should, it takes too long to warm up. It is warm, not hot. I would like to know about possible solutions.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks in advance.</li>
    <li> Cannot beat this product, especially at this price point! Works excellently and cleans up to appear brand new. Love it!</li>
    <li> It heats quickly, makes our hair shine, holds  our style like no other and reasonably priced to give all three of my daugthers and sisters as gifts!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  So much better than the &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34; brand that I have used for the last 7 years.  My hair has never been this soft or looked this good except for when I just stepped out of the beauty salon.  I get compliments on my hair now from strangers.  My hair looks like it should belong to someone else....not me.  Cause I have never had good hair until now.  My hair is naturally dry, wiry, frizzy, and curly.  In 5 minutes....my hair is transformed into soft, silky, and shiny beautiful hair.  WOW!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat as good.. it takes long to heat up..</li>
    <li> I almost purchase this at the mall kiosks for 3x the amount it was online, glad I didn&#x27;t I saved money plus it works just like the ones they sale at the mall. I love it and my daughter&#x27;s do too.</li>
    <li> Excellent makes vital hair</li>
    <li> I got this straightner about a year ago and it still works like brand new. I love it!!! Its the best straightner ever definitley worth your money! I reccommend this to anyone looking for a straightner !!!!! Best product ever! Jose eber is a really nice brand</li>
