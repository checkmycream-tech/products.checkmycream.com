<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best blending brushes and really shaves time off of your eye makeup routine.</li>
    <li> Amazing blending brush, I use this everyday to blend my eyeshadow.  I love all my Sigma brushes</li>
    <li> the brush came with the outer bristles poking out and splayed. Even after washing it, it was not shaped properly and was very prickly. I tried squeezing the bristles together to reshape it but it just would not hold. It has also been shedding since. Horrible brush. WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.</li>
    <li> Best makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever had and I know I will have at all times. Easy brush to do that perfect blending job and it is really soft!</li>
    <li> I love sigma brushes! So high end but for a considerably low price! must have! Great shader brush for your every day kit!</li>
    <li> Best brush for blending. To hell with MAC brushes! I love this brand because they&#x27;re affordable and user friendly! Once you try a Sigma brush, you will love them! I own quite a few... Hell, I need to do a commercial for them-lol!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever wanted a blending brush that does just what its name indicates, then the digma E25 blending brush is the brush for you. I love using this brush as it allows for the perfect control in blending colors without creating a mess. The bristles are soft and feel really smooth on the skin and not at all harsh like some other brushes that i&#x27;ve had i really love this brush.</li>
    <li> I really like the Sigma E25. It is the perfect size and works great for placing shadow in you crease and/or blending out color. Overall, this was a great buy and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a less expensive version of the MAC 217 brush and this is perfect.  It&#x27;s soft, well made and works like a charm.  Love love love it and all for the fraction of the price I would have paid for a MAC brush.</li>
    <li> I had been on the fence about purchasing this brush as I was trying to make do with what I had, but wow what a difference! I am a fan of beauty blogger Jaclyn Hill and bought this brush (and the E40) from her recommendation. These brushes have completely changed my eyeshadow game! It&#x27;s so easy to get professional looking shadow now. These two brushes are definitely a must have for every collection!</li>
    <li> I really like this blending brush . It was cheaper then buying it from  the store and i got it two days after i ordered it :)This brush works exactly the same as a MAC or SEPHORA brush . i am very happy with this product and it was worth the money</li>
    <li> Wonderfull brush and Amazon,  as usual, delivered it right on time!</li>
    <li> this is probably the best brush i have ever usedd! it is so multi-purpose. the quality of the brush itself is beyond belief.</li>
    <li> I love using this brush for blending my eyeshadow. It does the job, &amp; is a great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This has to be my most favorite make-up brush. It does wonders, and I love how it completely takes away harsh lines. It blends out the colors just wonderfully. I ordered this brush along with the E45 brush, and they came a lot sooner than the expected delivery date. Sigma does an awesome job to makes sure their customers are fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> Can I just say that I absolutely LOVE this brush! This is pretty much my holy grail of blending brushes! This brush does a perfect job of blending my eyeshadow effortlessly. The bristles on the brush help blend out the shadow to get the perfect look. It is dense enough to pack on the shadow but tapered enough to help blend shadow. I will probably end up buying another one of these brushes because you can never have too many blending brushes in your collection and on top of that you really can&#x27;t beat the price, compared to other department store brand blending brush. If you are on the hunt for a blending brush or are new to makeup I would 100% recommend this brush to  you!</li>
    <li> So happy with my blending brush ! Thank you !</li>
    <li> best blender brush i have ever used.  I don&#x27;t know how i ever applied eyeshadow without this brush before.  Looks so natural and polished</li>
    <li> This is a great blending brush.  It is more dense than the E40 brush so it works better to blend out shadows on my eyes.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are amazing, this is one I use daily, great for the crease and blending.</li>
    <li> Perfect for eye crease!!</li>
    <li> I use this every day, on every eyeshadow application. I have never found a dupe in a cheaper brush for the precision and quality that this particular brush gives. Blending is effortless and it gives the perfect finish every time. If you only spend money on one high quality brush, make it this one. Even though Sigmas are known for lasting, if you care for them properly, I have ordered two more so I always have one readily available.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this brush and received it within 5 days, very happy about that.  Its soft but not to soft.  Blends great.  Very happy and will  order it again.</li>
    <li> This is the second Sigma brush that I have purchased. It does a great job blending eye shadows. I think that I will be purchasing more Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> Omg!...Every woman needs this brush!!! Great for applying shadow in the crease to build pigment.</li>
    <li> Perfect &amp;#34;for everything&amp;#34; brush. I have plenty of make up brushes, but I&#x27;ve found that (if I have to) I can do an entire eye look with just this one brush! It can put down color all over the lid, is perfect for crease work as well as blending. I&#x27;ve had two of these babies for around 2 years now with many many many washes and they are holding up beautifully! Definitely worth the investment.  Plus, every time I&#x27;ve ordered from Sigma I&#x27;ve gotten a free travel size brush with my order :)</li>
    <li> You will hear any makeup guru tell you how much of a difference good makeup brushes make... and it&#x27;s so true! I had been watching YouTube videos and reading tutorials but was still failing at that beautifully blended eye look. I finally broke down and decided to spend the money on this brush that I&#x27;d seen so many YouTube gurus use. I can honestly tell you it was money very well spent. I apply my eyeshadows in their typical places (lid, crease, outer corner, brow bone) and I look like a mess. Then I get this brush out and boom, the shadows come together perfectly after just a few swipes. This brush is also versatile. You can use it to apply shadow if you&#x27;re just looking for a light, natural look. I have washed this brush and experienced no loss of bristles, softness, or shape. If you&#x27;ve found yourself having trouble getting your eye looks just right trust me on this one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Came very fast and love the product!</li>
    <li> Very pleased and will probably buy other shape brushes from Sigma.  Easy to wash and dry.  Will need a sleeve to keep brush bristle in good condition.</li>
    <li> I just received these last night and after I opened them I was so impressed with the feel of the brush in my hand I had to use them! I love that even tho all 3 brushes I ordered (E35, E25 and E30) were different sizes all of them had the same feel in my hand. Kinda like holding a pencil. So I washed my face and put on more makeup! I chose a style that would allow me to use all of them, and use them the way they are meant to be used. There was no shedding and they felt nice and solid in my hand. . The 2 bigger blending brushes worked great and the smaller pencil brush was very precise without being too stiff. After I got done with them I washed them and all 3 came clean without any problems. I normally wash new brushes before I use them, but I couldn&#x27;t wait and I knew I&#x27;d be washing off the makeup I was going to be putting on. I checked them this morning and again they dried well and still no shedding. Out of the 3 I&#x27;m pretty sure the pencil brush will be my go to brush , but that also could be because of the way I do my makeup everyday. I would like to say that I saw on a review from someone that she was upset that Sigma does offer a free gift if you leave a review and yes they do, however they don&#x27;t say anywhere on the card that it has to be a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> This is my second brush from sigma and definitely won&#x27;t be my last. The bristles are super soft, and the head is just the right size for applying eyeshadow all over the lid and blending harsh lines to create that perfect smokey effect. I could do with another one of these in my collection. Super fast delivery as well, and I live all the way in Scotland!</li>
    <li> Pinceau de qualité, look très haut de gamme à avoir absolument dans sa trousse à maquillage pour un maquillage parfait.</li>
    <li> Like this brush ... it&#x27;s a bit scratchy. Prefer the Elf fluffy blending brush to this but overall it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> This blending brush is a must! This brush does it all. It works very well for applying product to the lid, blending, and highlighting. Works for the basic everyday eyeshadows, and the edgy smokey eyes. You can use either side of the brush for application to the lid &amp; highlight, but the top of the brush is amazing for creasework and blending. This brush is amazing for beginners.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are the best (I&#x27;m the wife of the Amazon acct) LOL</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally receive my brushes. I ordered the \\&quot;Eye Kit\\&quot; and five additional brushes to have the full set of eye brushes. I ripped the box open to find all the brushes in a cute mesh bag with a drawstring and each brush was in its own little plastic sleeve, none of the bristles has been bent or crumpled at a quick glance. There was a little card that explained to first clean before use soooo I did. No shedding &amp; no dye flowed thur the soapy clear water :o). Once dry I went to apply my shadows with and the brush felt like silk in combination with my eye primer &amp; eye shadows. I got a little more excited and decided to do the foiling technique....OMG!!! FLAWLESS!!! I soon found myself using each and every brush. The brushes are not heavily weighted so they really felt comfortable &amp; easy to control unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m looking forward to passing the word about Sigma. I recommend these brushed to anyone who is looking for the perfect brushes at a affordable price - the next order will be the face brushes.</li>
    <li> One of the best blending brushes I owned</li>
    <li> Wonderful, it blends eye shadows really well</li>
    <li> love love love this brush... its great for blending and cleaning up the different eye shadows in one look.. great for smokey eye look</li>
    <li> great brush!! and more affordable than other high end brands than are not as good , can&#x27;t wait to order more! : D</li>
    <li> I have been using the same brush to apply my eyeshadow for years and it was finally time to try something new. The sigma brand is great for their entire line of brushes and I love the quality. This brush is a great size and a great price! Plus fast shipping! Will continue to purchase sigma brushes in the future!!</li>
    <li> I just ordered this and 8 different sigma brushes  for eyes makeup and they arrived very quickly.They are very good quality,I strongly recommed Sigma brushes.Thank you sigma! I will be ordering many more brushes!</li>
    <li> These are fake sigma brushes don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
    <li> I believe these brushes are not of the same quality as some older Sigma E25s that I have. I am very disappointed because I had previously bought some Sedona Lace EB09 brushes (same as Sigma E25) on sale but after I using them I thought they weren&#x27;t as nice as the older Sigma E25s that I had so I bit the bullet and paid $12 ea for 2 Sigma E25s. I just received my Sigma order and these E25s are exactly the same as the Sedona Lace that I had paid less than $8 ea for! Not to mention Sigma&#x27;s shipping is much pricier than Sedona Lace&#x27;s, although I will admit Sigma&#x27;s shipping was lightning fast compared to Sedona Lace. All in all I feel like I got ripped off and will buy my brushes from Sedona Lace from now on since their brushes are of the same quality and they have nice sales quite often.</li>
    <li> I got this bits hams the real one from mac that it dupes. I actually like this one better because it keeps it shape and quality better through washing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush. I&#x27;ve heard nothing but awesome reviews for Sigma brushes but I was disappointed. This brush&#x27;s bristles are pretty coarse and hangs on to a ton of product. My drugstore brushes do a better job in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for blending and and also precision work.  This is one of the most versatile brushes as it can be used to pack on color, blend, or place color in the outer corner.  And if I can get it cheaper from Sigma rather than getting the comparable MAC 217 for a lot more, I will always go with Sigma.  Even better when I can get it on Amazon and not pay for shipping with Amazon Prime :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brush... Great for blending and your brow area!</li>
    <li> Everyone raves about the Sigma brushes, so I needed to try them out. They are now my go-to brushes! They are just the right density and give the correct amount of pressure. Now I understand what make-up artists mean when they say &amp;#34;let the brush do the work for you&amp;#34;. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. Makes eye shadow more subtle and natural. No harsh lines, easy to blend with and most of all durable! Washed it and used it so many times already.</li>
    <li> You get what the company says you will get. A great product, high quality, low cost.. That gives it a 5 star in my book!!</li>
    <li> Great brush for blending out eyeshadow! Just make sure to clean brush when it starts looking dirty, the cleaner it is the easier it is to achieve beautiful eye looks. I wash mine with warm water and baby shampoo.</li>
    <li> Just got my new sigma E-25 blending brush in the mail today and after using it for the first time I would say this product is a great one. Im loving it, its a great blending brush and im going to add it to my collection of wonderful sigma brushes. Also I ordered this brush along with other items on amazon but this brush got to me super fast, and I was very happy about that.</li>
    <li> As always Sigma brushes live up to their reputation for quality items, i am indeed very pleased with my order, however its just another addition to my collection.....Great Job to the Sigma Company.  Regards,  Patrice...R</li>
    <li> I am a beginner in applying eyeshadows and this brush made it really effortless compared to other brushes I was using before. I love it and plan to buy more sigma brushes to my collection.</li>
    <li> The brush of my biggest disappointment. I purchased it to get acquainted with Sigma brushes, but this is a terrible experience. Already from beginning it looked rather tattered. I washed it in a week together with other brushes - all looked wonderful except for this Sigma blending one. It became even more ragged and a couple of hairs started to fall out. Now I&#x27;m trying to treat it as accurate and careful as possible, but it&#x27;s just getting worse. I plan to buy another company&#x27;s blending brushes to substitute this one. Maybe other brushes of Sigma are better, but the one I have is just a waste</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Better than Mac Brush and a good price tooooo.</li>
    <li> Love it so much. It makes blending so much easier!</li>
    <li> I had purchased an E25 2 years ago and have since misplaced it.  It was my favorite brush, and it had been gone long enough that I figured I might as well get a new one.  I ordered both brushes on Amazon.  The second brush was nothing like the first.  The fibers feel synthetic, as opposed to the first&#x27;s natural hairs, the bristles aren&#x27;t nearly as long and it generally performs less effectively than my first.  I am very disappointed with this product.  I don&#x27;t know whether it is definitely a knock off or if sigma has changed the brush, but I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My first sigma brush and I am impressed! It is crazy how much a great quality brush can change how your make up looks. I have been missing out, but no more, after this purchase I went and bought many more sigma brushes. I watch a lot of Youtube beauty guru&#x27;s and they swear by these brushes, now I know why. Great quality, great price, great results: you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I verified that the seller was an authorized Amazon retailer on the Sigma Beauty website and there were no problems at all.  The quality is the same as the other Sigma brushes I&#x27;ve purchased directly from Sigma Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush for creating the outer V with a dark shade as well as using it with my transition shade.</li>
    <li> just perfect, blends amazing, feels soooo soft. much better than the cheap knockoffs i bought. an essential to my everyday makeup routine.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best blending brush I have ever used. The shape is perfect as well for applying color to the crease and then blending out.</li>
    <li> Brush is great for blending. Just love this one. Some hair is coming out but I ignore this. I need it for blending. Soft bristles.</li>
    <li> Great make up brushes, my daughter loves them and uses them all the time. Affordable prices and excellent quality, will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Along with getting my first sigma brush the E35 I bought another one same day the E25 and it is AMAZING! Blending is by far the most important thing to do when applying heavy colors to the eyes and mixing colors and this brush does the best job at blending out any harsh lines and its super soft! Also received these brushes a couple days before the they should have arrived so I was definitely very pleased with the timing of shipping these products! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
    <li> Mac who?? This my first Sigma brush.I&#x27;m in love.Buy a Sigma brush you won&#x27;t regret it.They&#x27;re amazing and a lot cheaper than Mac brushes.</li>
    <li> Very good brush: soft, minimal shedding and good blending ability. Also the package came on time from the retailer, which was impressive. I will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great for blending. really happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> It is a very good product!! I like this sigma blending very much, I really loved it and the price is perfect.</li>
    <li> THIS BLENDING BRUSH IS AMAZINNNNNGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!! :) - It is a must have and perfect for creating different eye shadow looks and blending them beautiful.</li>
    <li> love this brush I am new to the sigma brush line and I am hooked. So far so good it gives great application of eye shadow and it is so soft. I loved it so much I bought more brushes from the sigma line.</li>
    <li> Really love this brush. Excellent for blending colours in the crease. Also good for cream products. I&#x27;ve had it a for a while now and it is losing it&#x27;s shape a bit, but still functional.</li>
    <li> The E25 blending is an absolute FAV of mine, it goes hand in hand with the Sigma E40 tapered blending brush!  The E25 is great for getting right in the crease of the eye and blending it out very nicely!  Simply put, this is another brush that you just have to add to your collection!!</li>
    <li> Best brushes, love Sigma products because they keep their shape!</li>
    <li> Love it, blends really well.  It&#x27;s a high quality brush.</li>
    <li> Most MUA used these brushes they work wonders with makeup blends well sigma is the best I love these brushes !!!</li>
    <li> This bush is perfect for picking up the product and applying to the lids of your eyes. It also can be used to blend out eyeshadow.Its brush is definitely worth the money! Its exactly what i needed, and it picks up the product perfectly and applies beautifully.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the E30 after doing a search for new cosmetic brushes to add to my supply. After seeing so many consistent high ratings, combined with the reasonable price tag, I decided to give them a try. So far they have been fabulous. They are so far no different from the other brushes I have, that I bought from a department store for double the price.  No shedding at all and blends shadow wonderfully. I wish I had found these sooner.  Will definitely buy Sigma in the future!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite blending brush. This makes blending eyeshadow so much easier. High quality brush! This is a must-have in my collection. Saves time and money. The bristles on this brush are so soft and you really don&#x27;t see much shedding .</li>
    <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and ease</li>
    <li> This is the perfect blending brush, high quality, bristles are soft, would definitely recommend to anyone! I use it every day!!</li>
    <li> It is a great brush with very soft bristles. I love all Sigma brushes!</li>
    <li> Where do I start with this review! This brush is awesome! After much research I decided to buy this brush and I am SOOOOOOOO happy I did. It makes my makeup application a breeze and I have gotten much compliments about my eye makeup since using this brush. I have very unique eyes as I am part Asian (Japanese and Filipino) and Part Hawaiian. I have big eyes but I don&#x27;t have a deep crease and not much lower eyelid space. I use this brush for simple 2 color blending or for something a little more dramatic a Smokey look. It has made it so much easier to blend my eyeshadows without much effort. I will definitely be adding more Sigma brushes to my collection.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush upon recommendation.  This brush is perfect for outer corner application and blending.  I truly love love love this brush!  It holds onto product really well and you just need to lightly sweep with it.  Worth every penny...which is ironic because I have used more expensive brushes that have not worked as well as this one.  So great!</li>
    <li> This brush is good for putting more product in the crease and making the cease a bit more defined while blending out. Very soft and a staple in your brush collection.</li>
    <li> This brush is super compatible and versatile as it can be used in many ways such as applying eye shadow, blending harsh lines and highlighting under your brows. The size was perfect for my eyelids and the brush itself is really soft so there&#x27;s definitely no irritation when applying. I haven&#x27;t dealt with any shedding since I haven&#x27;t washed it yet but from my experience with Sigma I don&#x27;t think I would worry about it.</li>
    <li> Very fluffy and blends very well. I use it for the crease and for applying an eye shadow all over the lid. Doesn&#x27;t shed and applies product very smoothly without poking my delicate eyelids. Similar to MAC&#x27;s famous brush for a fraction of the price, I would buy this one instead of MAC, and I have both.</li>
    <li> This brush is now the essential piece for my daily makeups. With this and another eye shadow brush, you can produce nearly all neutral looks for daily wear. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> SIGMA BRUSHES ARE AMAZING! I got the E25 brush and it is FANTASTIC. It does all you work for you! It seemlessly blends, and it picks up the right amount of pigmentation. These are similar if not better than mac brushes which retail at twice the price. I cannot wait to pick up more of these brushes because the kits (make me cool, mrs.bunny etc.) are so cool! Thanks sigma for making awesome priced GREAT quality brushes! These are a must buy!</li>
    <li> I love how soft the bristles are. They blend so well and it is my go to use when I need to blend out Dark colors.</li>
    <li> This is the brush, I absolutly love it. I thougt I&#x27;ve was buying the incorrect shadows, I was about to throw the away, then I try them using this E25brush, the results were amazing. In summary I was using the wrong brush.</li>
    <li> Good quality, soft blending brush. I keep it clean by washing with shampoo every other week. It does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Great brush for crease color and shading. A little bit of shedding which I don&#x27;t like but otherwise, a good brush.</li>
    <li> I had heard rants and raves about Sigma brushes online and overall I feel like it is a good brush but isn&#x27;t fantastic. I understand that it is a blending brush but this feels a little bit &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; for me. I will be trying some of the other blending brushes out there for my eye shadows but definitely will be keeping this one as is it good for highlighting the brow area and dusting on some lighter shimmer shades. As far as blending out darker or warmer colors I feel like I really have to work with this brush, maybe something a little more dense would suit my needs.</li>
    <li> So good at doing a cut crease and smoking out any eye shadow. I need more!</li>
    <li> my wife said she got a fake brush!she compare the one that she got from sigma beauty and its really big different the bristle is hard than the orginal one!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush loved it I&#x27;ll buy another for my to-go bag</li>
    <li> Flawless blending brush!  Works beautifully to blend any and all colors together. I use it for blending the crease. Very soft and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I went my whole life and didn&#x27;t know I needed a blending brush. But I did and you do too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Mac brush girl, but the Sigma brushes rival any high end brush bad you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Also love my E25 &amp; F80 kabuki....best brushes ever!</li>
    <li> Sheds like crazy! Don&#x27;t buy this crap! You will be disappointed if you do trust me first &amp;#34;sigma&amp;#34; purchase and disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye shadow blending brush, so glad I purchased it!  I use it, pretty much, daily, and it has kept its shape and form, and still works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Good brush to blend the eye shadows!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> This is likely the one Sigma brush I couldn&#x27;t live without. It&#x27;s incredibly soft and supple, and is absolutely perfect for blending. I also use this brush to add a subtle highlight to my brow bone. Fantastic brush!</li>
    <li> So upset this brush ended up being fake. The picture is not accurate at all. You can feel it in the weight. I compared it to my actual real ones I have from the actual sigma store. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> very nice brush and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Perfect Blending size! At first I did wish it was more done shaped, but this shape works just as good!</li>
    <li> This brush is just ok. It has lost it&#x27;s shape somewhat and is pretty scratchy. IIt does a fairly decent job of blending, but it takes a while. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a real sigma brush but the print on the handle looks like the real letters.</li>
    <li> great blending brush for the price... def worth getting this rather than the mac one which is much more expensive</li>
    <li> My wife love it and say it&#x27;s as good as the expensive brands</li>
    <li> Best blending brush by far!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. The first time I used it in the crease it worked beautifully. this brush is way better than the rest of my crease brushes. It blends very well too. It is also soft. I have never ordered sigma brushes from the sigma website so i don&#x27;t know the difference but the package looks great if it&#x27;s a knock off.</li>
    <li> great brush, I love sigma brushes. This is a great brush for blending, I now want more sigma brushes for my makeup. Would buy this product again and will be purchasing more in the future. My favorite brush of all my brushes</li>
    <li> Great for placing and blending powder shadows. The shape of the brush allows for multiple uses. Held up well after washing - no bristle fallout.</li>
    <li> sigma brushes are my preferred master is especially softness helps my eyeshadow blending  to perfection your hair is extra soft</li>
    <li> Its good but from the high ratings i expected more</li>
    <li> I really love this brush!  It blends perfectly and arrived on time. Will definitely be ordering from sigma again and hope to keep enjoying their awesome brushes!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this brush!</li>
    <li> Even though it says &amp;#34;blending&amp;#34; I recently discovered that this works great for applying darker shade on the corner of my eyes and sweeping it across the crease. I think for my eye shape this works better than the E45, as I already have very deep set eyes. I love this and use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> I hear this and that about Sigma&#x27;s eye brushes but I have to say this brush works great for me. I&#x27;ve experienced no shedding like some reviews from various sources in the beauty community. It&#x27;s more affordable than the MAC equivalent but since I do not own the MAC one, I can&#x27;t speak as to how the quality compares. I just know I didn&#x27;t want to spend twice as much for the same type of brush, and this one suits me perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, soft and blends colors together nicely. Minimal shedding, high quality. Nicely packaged and arrived on the estimated date of arrival.</li>
    <li> This brush is actually a great stoop to MAC 217 brush! It is definitely just like it and it blends so well!!! I love it.</li>
    <li> Sigma Blending - E25, I bought this brush after watching Tiffany in youtube, it&#x27;s a good blending brush, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for blending eyeshadows</li>
    <li> i love these brush it makes doing your makeup so much easier</li>
    <li> in love with this brush works great and blends easily&lt;br /&gt;I love sigma, the majority of their products are excellent</li>
    <li> I saw the E25 blending brush on a you tube tutorial and it looked like it worked pretty good. After I received it I used it once with mu eyeshadow pallet and it was wonderful!! totally worth the money, it dosen&#x27;t shed and it comes with cleaning instructions which I like. very pleased with this brush I will be get more sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> I received this brush today and I rushed to put it to good use.  It blends the crease perfectly.  I can tell that this will be a brush that I will reach for very often.  It is just the right combination of stiff and soft at the same time.  This is the third brush that I have ordered from Sigma and it is certainly not the last.  Next on my list is the tapered blending brush!  Sigma brushes cannot be beat in quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Good products and good seller.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH! Great for blending eye shadows, and it can be used for shading on other parts of the face. Sigma makes great brushes. I have almost all of them!</li>
    <li> I love this sigma brush,blends very well,no shedding. I also have the 12pc brush set well worth the money Sigma</li>
    <li> My favorite brushes!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush, it&#x27;s in my makeup kit &amp; I use it on all of my clients.</li>
    <li> This brush is beyond worth the hype. Definitely necessary for all of us makeup lovers! The YouTube community first introduced me to Sigma brushes, but there is no way to understand how great this brush is until you use it yourself!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s your MAC 217 but far cheaper ladies! Seriously, it is as close as you can get,,,it&#x27;s well made, no shedding, and very soft. A Multipurpose shader/blender which ideally allows you to cut a soft crease, although occasionally Sigma doesn&#x27;t cut the brush exactly right so they are not always flat enough for the control you need to cut a crease, but generally it&#x27;s not a problem. Since you get a fantastic hi quality brush for approx half the price, I def think it&#x27;s one to seriously consider. If $14 is too much in your mind to spend on a make-up brush you should hop on over to Coastal Scents website and check out their version (The Pro Blending Fluff) at a mere $4.95 I will attempt a link, but it may [...]</li>
    <li> After reading reviews online and watching videos on Youtube, I ordered the blending brush to use with my new Naked 3 three weeks ago. This brush is AMAZING. All of my eye shadows do what I want them to when I use this thing!! Use it in your crease to blend out your darker colors. Believe the hype you read and see on Youtube about it. Seriously! I am going to order another to speed up my makeup routine. LOVE IT! Esp. after applying my MAC paintpot. They make the eyeshadow Gods sing, y&#x27;all!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchase a sigma brush. I love my brush! Thank you for sending it in a timely manner and packing it so nicely for shipping. The brush was better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;So, now that I have been using it for a few days now, I would like to update the review. The brush blends beautifully; I would compare it to my old NARS brush and half the cost. I wash it daily and found no issues with losing any hairs. It is a well made brush that arrived earlier than expected beautifully packed. I intend on purchasing more sigma brushes soon.</li>
    <li> Sigma changed their brush. Like other reviewers I bought a first one a few years back and loved it so I wanted to get a second. This one is synthetic unlike the original. I had heard that sigma was changing over their entire like to synthetic which is a really stupid move. Save your money and get the mac 217 as this no longer the great dupe that it once was.</li>
    <li> I debated trying sigma brushes for over a year and hate myself for doing so. I had been using a mix of brushes before ranging from ecotools to a few mac brushes. I am so pleased with this brush, it blends crease colors beautifully! The bristles are incredibly soft and they do not tug at the delicate skin in the eye area. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It does the job perfectly and is soo soft. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s honestly become one of my most used brushes. I would highly recommend it- shipping was also fast</li>
    <li> i bought this one for my wife and she definitely loves it. she is a make up artist and always been bragging with this brand. quality is really awesome! highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Its the only eye shadow brush you need, it blends perfectly and applies flawless, the only problem i had its that it looses the form if you wash it. You should also buy a brush guard http://www.amazon.com/Makeup-Cosmetic-Beauty-Netting-Protector/dp/B00BSPVDE8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1395856749&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;brush+guard</li>
    <li> I was always under the impression that mac brushes are the best out there and some brushes are, but some are not. This is the BEST blending brush; worlds above mac&#x27;s 217 blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, it does a way better job. It&#x27;s way softer on the eyelid especially when you&#x27;re swiping back and forth repeatedly. Aaaaand it&#x27;s half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on Sigma brushes. Will likely never buy mac brushes again.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been looking for a good blending brush for so long and she said this is exactly what she&#x27;s looking for! It&#x27;s the perfect size and the quality is great</li>
    <li> I really like Sigma products. And I wanted to buy this brush long time ago. Finally I have the best blending brush ever:) you can blend any type of eyeshadows with it:) I would recommend everybody to buy it!!! Thanks Sigma!!!</li>
    <li> I was given a set of sigma brushes as a gift and it came with a smaller version of the E25. I was looking at some MAC brushes as well and noticed that this brush is very similar to the MAC 217 brush but this one is half the price!</li>
    <li> This is good quality.Long handle for soft or dramatic look.  This is a good as the mac brushes and good.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Does exactly what its suppose to- Blends really well. Very High Quality, if not better. Thank you Sigma, never let me down.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. Soft, and great blending tool!</li>
    <li> you have to use it if you want to have eye make-up without stains!!! it is so INDISPENSABLE to make a good work!! all my customers like the way i work with this one!!</li>
    <li> I love how it gets the blending job done, however, I got the travel size. I expected the regular size like it shows in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love this Sigma blending brush!  After applying eye makeup I whisk this brush along any edges/creases to create a more blended, flawless look.  Great quality and a great value.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the cheaper makeup brushes in the past and got this as part of a certificate I got for Christmas. I just to say &amp;#34;yes!&amp;#34; this is the answer I had been looking for with the issues I was having getting my eyeshadow to blend and fade the right way. I applied my crease color and then applied the Sigma blending brush to my color and it really blended beautifully ...just what I have longed for for so long. I will be buying more Sigma brushes in the future. No more wasted money or time for me! Yay!</li>
    <li> This brush is pretty nice.  I use it to blend in my crease.  The bristles are sofe, but don&#x27;t hold their shape well (even with a guard).</li>
    <li> one of the best brushes I have ever purchased. Once I started doing my routine makeup tutorials, I noticed I could not leave this alone. I now have two and one more to be ordered soon!</li>
    <li> Love it. Great for blending eyeshadow, applying (wet or dry) shadow to the lid and great for more precise work as well.</li>
    <li> Was not happy with this at all.  The package was horrible to open and I ended up cutting some of the bristles off trying to open.</li>
    <li> This brush is a MUST for anyone who uses eyeshadow. It blends eye makeup perfectly and is very soft! It is dense enough to do its job, but is really easy to clean and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the hairs shedding or breaking. This is, in my opinion, almost as good as MAC, but a lot cheaper. I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I like this brush its soft not the softest but for the price its really nice. The shape has to be molded after washing not like some of my other brushes.</li>
    <li> I love sigma brushes they are wonderful and will order them all not at once cuss I can&#x27;t afford to but one or two at a time and I&#x27;ll have the set in time but there worth it for sure ...</li>
    <li> Does a really good job at blending.  I think Sigma brushes are about as good as MAC</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a Sigma brush I didn&#x27;t love, including this one. E35 and E25 are my favorite eye brushes from Sigma. E25 is a great crease brush, no shedding, it&#x27;s soft, and holds up well with cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect blending brush. This was my first Sigma brush and it WILL NOT be my last.Love love love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is okay.  I find that I don&#x27;t use it as much since I really like one of their other brushes better.  There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with this brush.  It&#x27;s a great blending brush.</li>
    <li> Make up goes on smooth will no lines. Uses less make up the other bushes that I have use !</li>
    <li> Blending tool, absolutely necessary for your makeup tutorial! Wish I had a couple more of them!</li>
    <li> such a good brush for a good price it blends well and makes me feel like a pro make up artist</li>
    <li> i like this more than my mac217 brush, almost the same thing but i like the quality of hair on this better than the mac brush</li>
    <li> This brush is fluffy enough to blend colors easily and stiff enough to provide control in the process of blending. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> After using just drugstore brushes for quite sometime, I am so pleased with Sigma brushes! This brush is a multitasker, not only does it blend harsh lines, but it is great for applying primer, laying cream shadows down neatly and evenly and also applying powder and mineral colors. This is a must have in your brush collection!!</li>
    <li> this is brush is great. all of my brushes are from Sigma, and I love every single one of them.</li>
    <li> Awesome at blending eyeshadow</li>
    <li> Wonderful blending brush, and very similat to the mac version</li>
    <li> The brushes are good but not that strong to last for sometime</li>
    <li> Best brush! It&#x27;s def better than MAC!</li>
    <li> I bought two of this direct from sigma after hearing raves about this being a mac 217 dupe. I have a 217 and find it to be denser than the sigma brush. The sigma brush is fluffier and has more give  while the mac one is more dome shaped and is stiffer. The hair on the sigma is softer but becomes wiry after a wash. One of the two brushes has unruly flyaway bristles that  ruin the shape of the brush. I may have to trim some of the hairs. The sigma brushes lose their shapes after the wash, no matter how hard I try to shape them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mac brush is good for packing in the colour and for blending while the sigma seems to be better at blending than packing in the colour. Decent quality for the price but I&#x27;ll probably still reach for my mac more often.</li>
    <li> The brush did everything it promised to do! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, its affordable and the brissles are slightly stiff but still soft. I have lost a few strands and I havent had it long. I&#x27;m not sure why the brissles were falling out, maybe a Sigma knock off? I still love it tho.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brushes~  Im a STRONG believer in economical products.  In my business, it is TOO easy to end up in the poor house if you dont shop around for quality WITH economy.  Plus, this company is so over played by beauty bloggers, its sickning.  I know of TOO many people that boycotted Sigma because of their social media overkill.  When  companies send every new collection out to a &#x27;beauty bloggers&#x27; that are CLEARLY not professionals and can hardly apply their OWN faces decently, or are KNOWN coke heads.  I dont know, says something about them...dont you think?&lt;br /&gt;However....the Sigma E25 is a love of mine I just cant let go of.&lt;br /&gt;The ULTIMATE blender.</li>
    <li> Great tool to blend and difuminate the eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> The blending brush from Sigma came on time and it was exactly what I needed. It was a good price too. It works perfectly, I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I love this brush it helps blend out the make up so much easier then a cheap drugstore brush. It also came fast!</li>
    <li> You can tell right away this is the real deal by the packaging alone. It was nicely boxed in a sigma holder and the brush itself is perfect for my needs. More cost effective than Mac but every bit as good as a Mac 227. Highly recommended and buy from sigma itself.</li>
    <li> This is a great blending brush; it fits nicely in my crease and delivers color well. I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed with a sigma brush.</li>
    <li> Bought one before this and just ordered another brush from sigma and all i have to say is this:&lt;br /&gt;I am a person who reads reviews before i buy something and and everyone was absolutly right about this product. I love it and the price was great along with the texture of the brush and the look. Purchased many MAC brushes and these are just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. BUT THE ONLY THING I CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT IS THE PACKAGING. MY BRUSH WAS SMUSHED IN THE PAPER PACKAGING. USE BOXES! OTHER THAN THAT IM HAPPY.</li>
    <li> Its way too stiff for blending for me. I did not want to buy the MAC 217 blending brush, too expensive so I purchased this one. After trying to use it, I broke down and got the MAC 217, this is definitely no substitute. I wanted to love it, really I did, even after washing it, it was too stiff. Oh well, I&#x27;ll give it to my niece in an xmas makeup pack I&#x27;m giving her, she&#x27;ll appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Such a amazing dupe for the mac 217 brush! Best contour brush it does the work for you! I will get more!</li>
    <li> I loved this brush so much I had to order another one!  I had received a travel size version of this brush from sigma a while back and liked it so much I wanted to order the full size brush, plus the shipping was actually cheaper on Amazon &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> No need to say how amazing sigma products are. I have all their brushes and will keep on buying them. Make up looks amazing when using these brushes.</li>
    <li> Not legitimate. The bristles fall out constantly and before I knew it my brush was really crappy. Suspecting it may be a knock off, I purchased the same brush from sigmas actual website and now I can for sure tell you it&#x27;s different. Don&#x27;t waste you money here. Buy from sigma.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush ever for packing on colore</li>
    <li> This is such a great brush!!! Sigma is a great company!</li>
    <li> I am fallen in love with Sigma brushes. I use this brush daily and am thinking of getting a few more. It blends so very nicely. No harsh lines with this blending brush. A must for your makeup brush collection. I especially like the white color as it reminds me to clean my brushes regularly.</li>
    <li> This brush is great quality at an amazing price.  Will recommend this product, and similar products to everyone!  Will be purchasing similar products immediately!</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday and used this brush at end of eye makeup. It really helped blend my darker crease shade out giving it a very blended look. It&#x27;s great at doing just what the brush says.. Blending.</li>
    <li> even though this a dupe for a popular makeup brush, i&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. i&#x27;ve heard sigma brushes are good quality for the money and i can now say i agree. fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after hearing about it a lot on youtube and then reading all the good reviews here.  I have to say I love Sigma and have quite a few other brushes from them but I was disappointed when I got this brush.  When I first took it out of the package it looked cheap because a bunch of the bristles were sticking out at random angles and after using it a few times it has started to shed.  I have been using it to blend out my crease color and it works pretty well but I just dont understand why the quality is not what I am used to getting from Sigma.</li>
    <li> I needed good blending brushes but I can’t afford a 25-35$ for a mac brush. So I asked around and seen that sigma are as good as mac but cheaper so I got the E35,E25 E30 E55 E45 and the E40. They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean. Shipping was fast and I really like them. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5, when I washed them some of the hair came out. It was the first time I cleaned them.  I don’t know if that’s normal or not. I haven’t tried cleaning them again I’m scared.</li>
    <li> The E25 is the first Sigma brush I&#x27;ve used, and I love it. I watch Tati (GlamLifeGuru is her username) on youtube and she recommended these brushes to use for blending. I wanted to try a Sigma brush, and when I found one on amazon for a fair price I decided to try it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I use it every single day now. It&#x27;s perfect to blend crease colors, and to make transitions between shades much smoother. I like to use it to pack a really dark brown in the outer-V of my eye, it adds great definition and depth. This brush is great for subtle looks, but I&#x27;m sure you could build it to do a great smoky eye as well. I highly recommend this brush to anyone who wants a beautiful eye look. The brush is authentic, very smooth, and well worth the small investment.</li>
    <li> What can I say that has not been said before?  This is definitely a classic brush that everyone loves, including myself.  Picks up product very well, applies and blends beautifully.  This is definitely the perfect blending brush, wishing I had more of!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay--a little too foofy to blend eyeshadow, but I&#x27;ve been using it more as a crease brush and it works well for that. For precise blending, I wound up buying Make Up For Ever Artisan PRECISION BLENDER BRUSH MEDIUM WAVY #216 after this one didn&#x27;t do what I wanted and it is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my first sigma brush and i am in love i have been in search of a good blendung brush i have an e.l.f blending brush but it really not doing the trick but this sigma brush is so soft and fluffy it does wonders and i loves it</li>
    <li> This is the best brush on the planet. This is my deserted island brush. I can&#x27;t do my makeup without it. It&#x27;s super soft and holds up to washing so well. And it just diffused shadow perfectly. I don&#x27;t see how people blend without this.</li>
    <li> A close-up photo of the actual brush head would be nice . . . since you are selling a BRUSH!  It&#x27;s fine to see the Sigma name over and over again in the photos but I need to see what the brush will actually look like.  The photos also need to be on a colored background so we can actually see the brushhead.  A white background with a white brushhead makes for poor viewing of the product.  Passing on this since I can&#x27;t tell what I would be buying.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite brushes!!</li>
    <li> When I first received this brush it looked like a blending brush, however when I have used it I was disappointed. From the first use, it became flimsy, and the bristles became irregular as if you have teased them.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a sigma brush the bristles are soft and it gets the job well done.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite brushes.  Love, love it.</li>
    <li> this is a great brush but they are expensive so can only get a few at a time, but that&#x27;s ok!</li>
    <li> There are only three eye makeup brushes that every girl really needs. One that precisely packs on color on the lid, an eyeliner brush, and this blending brush! It completes any makeup look by getting rid of harsh edges, or blending multiple colors so that they transition smoothly. It creates a beautiful and natural looking crease no matter what color shadow you use. This brush is what makes those fancy eye looks you find on Pinterest or in magazines actually doable on your own. Can&#x27;t recommend this brush enough.</li>
    <li> Nice brush for the money. Can&#x27;t compare to Mac or IT brushes though.</li>
    <li> I got this brush after hearing that it&#x27;s identical to my favorite eye blending brush, the MAC 217, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. At less than half the price of the MAC 217, the E25 performs just as well as its more expensive counterpart. The brush is soft to the touch and retains its shape perfectly after washing (no need for a brush guard while drying). It&#x27;s amazing for crease and outer v work, and it can also be used to apply a quick wash of sheer color all over the lid. If you like to do a lot of smokey eyes or looks that require seamless blending, the E25 is indispensable. If you prefer more natural, single color eye looks, this brush will cut down on application time because it can apply eyeshadow and blend it out at the same time. The E25 is worth every penny of the $10 it costs and then some. Amazing brush, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I went this long without buying this brush!  It has now replaced my shader brush, crease brush and blending brush making my makeup routine go must faster in the mornings.  The brush is also super soft and no shedding, which is always a plus!  I own other Sigma brushes and this one is constructed with the same quality that I have come to expect from the brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at this brush for months now and finally decided to purchase it. I&#x27;m trying to build a solid brush collection and find that Sigma brushes never disappoint! Love the brush and I&#x27;m already pondering my next purchase!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased the Sigma e25(I was always looking for a clean one) and I have the MAC 217 but I find myself reaching for the e25 much more.  I did have some trouble with the bristles being stained but once I switched cleansers the problem went away.  I really like this for blending and for putting a light was of color all over the lid.  Great brush and half the price of the others.</li>
    <li> Love it! True authentic Sigma brush. Super soft and long handle make application effortless. It got to Alaska in 4 days.</li>
    <li> love the service and product</li>
    <li> The perfect brush to use in the outer crease for a smokey eye. It&#x27;s practically foolproof, even for beginners like me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush! Amazing quality and identical to the MAC version, just way cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is not a real Sigma brush. There&#x27;s no doubt it is fake...It doesn&#x27;t even the number engraved on the metal part like it&#x27;s supposed to. Also, the bristle quality is horrid and sheds.</li>
    <li> An absolutely wonderful blending brush and all purpose brush! It is soft, easy to work with and a great value. It gets into the crease well, and picks up pigments well!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush, soft, and blends power eye shadow very well.  My eye shadow finally looks perfectly blended.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush! I use it to define my crease with a transition color or darken my outer-v eye area. It&#x27;s just an overall great blending brush, that is very multifunctional. I highly recommend having at least one brush like this in your makeup brush collection. You cant go wrong with it!</li>
    <li> I needed a good blending brush so i bought E25 and I&#x27;m glad I did .. It&#x27;s my Fav blending brush .. so soft .. blends the colors well&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t achieve a great look without using this brush</li>
    <li> This is by far my most used brush. It blends amazingly! I&amp;#34;ve washed this brush and its stays together perfect and doesn&#x27;t lose its shape. I absolutely recommend this over any other brush i&#x27;ve tried for blending!</li>
    <li> I have never been this upset before when purchasing something online. I ordered this brush along with a few brush guard packs (which in fact I&#x27;m in love with) I went to checkout and place my order on amazon, but because of their ABSOLUTELY DUMB AND POINTLESS rule or whatever you would like to call it about not being able to place an order of only \\&quot;add on items\\&quot; that is under 25 dollars, I had to find something that I thought was worth the 10 dollars I had left to spend. I decided on this brush. IT IS A FAKE. IT IS NOT REAL BY ANY MEANS. I HAVE THE REAL SIGMA E25 THAT I PURCHASED WITH A KIT FROM SIGMA. I compared them and they are by NO MEANS the same AT ALL. This is a FAKE. The brush isn&#x27;t even the same brush from the pictures. DO NOT BUY THIS BRUSH. IT IS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush.  Soft, blends well and does not hurt sensitive skin.  My only problem is that I had not checked cleaning instructions.... This brush, as soon as you wash, will lose shape and bristles go outwards.  I checked Sigma website, and while wet, brush must be placed in special elastic tubes/loops that keep the bristles in place until it dries.  Sigma sells the &amp;#34;dry&#x27;n Shape&amp;#34; for $32.</li>
    <li> Who DOESN&#x27;T need a great makeup brush?  This is definitely worth the price.  I have used cheaper brands, and the saying is true, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  This one rocks!</li>
    <li> I was soooo disappointed when this came in the mail. Immediately after i opened it it started to shed like crazy! i just ran a finger through it and at least 4 hairs fell off the brush. I have sigma brushes that i purchased from sigma and they do not shed like this one does. Also, i just finished washing it and the shape is COMPLETELY GONE. i&#x27;m so disappointed in this FAKE KNOCK OFF sigma product. Don&#x27;t buy this brush! go to the sigma website and buy a real authentic one!!!</li>
    <li> Not that great... The quality is so so....</li>
    <li> Amazing brush I am a make up artist and I have a Few of this brush ... Important part of my make up... It gives you that flawless look.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Brush sheds some hair when applying eyeshadow and when I wash it. Also lost its shape after third wash.</li>
    <li> I feel like this is the brush I&#x27;ve been looking for, all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is dense enough to hold a decent amount of product but flexible enough to blend product into my crease/eyelids. My eye lids tend to move underneath traditional shadow brushes, but, this brush is just enough to get the job done and really add some dimension to my eyes without looking like I&#x27;ve plopped tons of color in my creaseline. Anywho, this brush is a must for anyone&#x27;s eye shadow collection and an eyeshadow staple for beginners, novice and professional make-up artists.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush as a less expensive sub for the MAC 217 as a treat to myself.  It works so well that I think I may have to get myself another.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for blending. It is just the right size. It is soft and does the job well. No shedding.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush of all the sigma individual eye brushes. It is incredibly soft and gentle on the eye and blends color amazingly. It is almost an exact dupe for the MAC 217, but softer. I find that this one feels like a synthetic brush as the MAC one is slightly more scratchy. It&#x27;s just as good or better than the 217 for a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> I had ordered 2 E25 brushes last year from sigma and i loved them and as i frequently do others makeup and i use this brush often i wanted to buy more. I placed an order to buy 3 more and they were absolutely HORRIBLE. They looked nothing like the ones i had received the year prior to purchasing these 3. The bristles on all 3 are everywhere and are not as dense as the previous e25 i had ordered from the year before. So upset and annoyed, i shouldve purchased MAC or Sedona Lace brushes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush that could shade and blend all in one. I found it on the first try! The Sigma E25 had great reviews and I am glad that I&#x27;m adding to them. The bristles are soft, but hard enough that they don&#x27;t leave eyeshadow residue all over the the place like my EcoTools brushes do (I still love them though). They seem to elevate the glamor of my Naked2 palette even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love that Sigma added a free gift of an angled blush brush, which was actually the brush that I was eyeing when I purchased the Sigma Synthetic Kabuki kit for my daughter. It was so nice for Sigma to add that. I am definitely a fan.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to upgrade my makeup brushes for sometime now to high end brushes and was looking at M.A.C. brushes.  All the reviews said they were the best, but so very expensive.  I then talked to a friend of mine that does make-up professionally and she said that she uses Sigma brushes, and that they have the same quality brushes at a more affordable price.  I have just used mine for the first time today and love it.  I will continue to buy Sigma brushes until the set that I want is complete.  Thank you Sigma my Christmas eye make-up will look even better now!!!</li>
    <li> After your purchase they continue to hound you for feedback. I don&#x27;t appreciate the constant emails so they get a 1 star.</li>
    <li> Wanted the E 25 after watching a youtube makeup tutorial. I am so happy I found it on here! Nothing beats it!</li>
    <li> This is a great blending brush.  I love Sigma brushes!  They are so full and soft and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, I really do, but I don&#x27;t get all the hype. I get the hype over the F80...it&#x27;s my HG foundation brush. But this brush is just ok compared to my expectations. Maybe it&#x27;s fake but the quality is absolutely horrible. The brush strands fray and there&#x27;s already a lot of shedding.</li>
    <li> This is a very good eye blending brush. It is soft and comfy but dense and firm enough to do it&#x27;s job, beautifully. This brush cleans up easily and so far, mine don&#x27;t shed. I own two of these brushes and I use them almost daily.</li>
    <li> Good brush. I have had some fibers fall out already but I would still recommend the brush. Great job of blending, doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on my eyelid.</li>
    <li> I got this because I see all the youtube gurus use this and I wanted to try it. Love it !! The bristles are soft and does the job.</li>
    <li> Great brush!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived without this brush until now? Honestly, this brush is simply wonderful with applying and blending eyeshadow. It picks up product like nobody&#x27;s business and blends PERFECTLY. If you&#x27;re considering, just buy it now. The bristles are softer than I had anticipated, and now I&#x27;m more eager than ever to buy more Sigma brand brushes, hooooly crap. If every brush is like this, I&#x27;m going to try to get them all hahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is very sturdy and long, and bristles are a soft white. This feels like quite an expensive brush, but it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive for how good of quality this is. I would recommend this brush to makeup artists, or even people who have barely touched makeup. The bristles make applying,  blending, and shaping quite easy, so anyone can use it without questions or confusion.</li>
    <li> Love live love this brush!!! Blends eyeshadow a well with very little effort. Pretty much does all the work for you!!!</li>
    <li> Use to blend in crease, works great! Using with highly pigmented shadows for stage makeup, and it really blends and keeps the product where you want it instead of blending it to far out of desired area.</li>
    <li> I use this brush a lot to blend out my eyeshadow after I&#x27;ve applied it with more precise brushes.  It does a great job to make sure there are not harsh lines and everything is blended together. Its really great for a smoky eye.  I bought 2 of them, so I always have a clean brush ready for blending.  The price point is very good for a professional brush and works just as well as the MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> Product came on time. Great for use of blending pigments. Heard it is much like the #217 from MAC, although I have yet to try that brush myself personally. Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I like this brush, but I do not love it. It sheds and it doesn&#x27;t keep the shape after two washes.</li>
    <li> Have not tried. Partly because I am learning to use. But the brush is beautiful and looks very good. Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s my favorite brush now.</li>
    <li> I love using this brush when applying shadow to my crease.</li>
    <li> I needed a blending brush and so I decided to buy this brush because lots of people are great things about it. I am very pleased with this brush so far and I even received a gift with the brush. It is a shame that the gift was a shorter version of the same brush E25. I wish I received a different brush but hey it&#x27;s a gift and I got a spare brush so I cannot complain, right? ;)</li>
    <li> love it! I highly recommend this brush for creating beautifully blended color transitions. soft bristles, perfect density, overall a wonderful brush</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are the best brushes out there!! This brush is so soft and blended my eyeshadows perfectly without any mess.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best blending brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought my original one from Sigma&#x27;s website, just ordered 2 more. A few weeks ago I purchased 2 morphe M433 brushes because they were said to be dupes for the E25. NOPE. The morphe brushes fray SO BADLY. Don&#x27;t pick up color as well as the E25 &amp; just don&#x27;t blend as well. For 7 or 8 more dollars, the E25 is so much better. I don&#x27;t know how to ad a caption to my picture but the first two brushes are the Morphe&#x27;s &amp; the one on the far right is the Sigma. I&#x27;ve had my sigma for at least 4 months &amp; the Morphe&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had a few weeks &amp; only washed them like 3 times!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t have time to sit and write reviews, but I just have to. This brush is not authentic!  I ordered the exact same Sigma brush directly from Sigma and it was completely different. This brush has a USA stamp after the number stamp...Sigma does not!. Not to mention the hair on this brush is wicked and has no shape! The real Sigma brush is of great quality! Don&#x27;t waste your money...because you will get exactly what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this brush. Will be ordering more brushes, great product.</li>
    <li> The best blending brush that I ever brought</li>
    <li> This is an amazing blending brush.  I will be adding more sigma brushes to my kit and getting some for my daughters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I have added this brush to my collection, a great affordable blending brush for people who are just starting out.</li>
    <li> My favorite blending brush in my collection! I believe it&#x27;s probably a good dupe for the MAC 217. Thanks Sigma!</li>
    <li> Received super fast and am so happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I got one for me &amp; one for my sister. I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about Sigma brushes, I had to find out for myself what the hype was all about. And I&#x27;m glad I bough this, these brushes are so soft and true to application. I&#x27;m glad I got this! Recommend this all the way....</li>
    <li> This brush works beautifully. I LOVE a good makeup brush and this one has quickly become one of my favorites. I usually pack product on with a different brush, then swirl this brush through the color for a natural, flawless, clump free finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft- no scratchiness- and the brush is manufactured beautifully. Bristles rarely (dare I say, NEVER!) fall out of the brush. I highly recommend the Sigma E25 as crucial to every makeup bag!</li>
    <li> I guess my expectations for the brush was too high so when it didn&#x27;t do all that I thought it would I was disappointed. I gave it three stars also because the hair on the brush started to spread out like an old toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This brush is obviously very similar to the Mac 217. Comparing them side-to-side, they&#x27;re about the same size and density. The most significant difference is that the Sigma E25 has some &amp;#34;straggly&amp;#34; hairs (which after a couple of washes and conditionings got better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it&#x27;s handy to have a few blending brushes on hand, would buy again if I could get a better price on shipping to Canada. With the shipping, the price of the Sigma brush is about 2/3s that of the Mac (but it&#x27;s only 1/3 the price for Americans - unfair!).</li>
