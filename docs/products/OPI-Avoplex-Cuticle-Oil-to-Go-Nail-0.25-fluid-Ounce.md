      <li>Let me just say that it works a hundred times better than any of the cuticle oils like Sally Hansen, Mavala, Solar Oil on and on.  </li>
      <li>Love this cuticle oil as it is more of an ointment than a liquid oil.  </li>

      <li>Which is really a nice way to quickly put it on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this for my best friend and for my cousin who suffered from extremely dry and peeling cuticles all their lives.</li>
      <li>And this literally healed their problem and they now have smooth and healthy cuticles just like me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth buying- not only because it works great but also because it&#x27;s at a good price and the packaging makes it easy to take (and use) anywhere.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t run all over the place.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply/use, and I recommend it</li>
      <li>softens and helps remove excess cuticle easily</li>
      <li>The reason it gets 5 stars is package desgin and easy of use.</li>
      <li>I am now noticing that it is doing damage to the smooth growth of the nail.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really soft and feel really good.</li>
      <li>A good cuticle oil, such as this one, is not supposed to magically soak into your cuticles instantaneously.</li>
      <li>This particular item is meant to be kept handy in your purse or in your pocket which means that you use it ON THE GO.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it, and just bought 2 more tubes!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone suffering from dry cuticles.</li>
      <li>My cuticles used to be so dry and brittle, now they feel great.</li>
      <li>Since I wash my hands so many times a day, this helps keep my cuticles much nicer.</li>
      <li>Got here quickly</li>
      <li>so I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This is nice to put a extra one in the car or purse.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money...</li>
      <li>You are also supposed to use cuticle oil several times a day, and on a good day I use cuticle oils 4-6 times, particularly after washing my hands or having them in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush applicator provides the right amount of oil to the designated area.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what I thought it would be, cutile oil that keeps my manicure looking fresh.</li>
      <li>not messy, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands oily.  </li>
      <li>Since using this product I haven&#x27;t snagged any cuticles and they are really soft and easy to trim.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, not strong at all.  </li>
      <li>When I first used it the oil was...</li>
      <li>A bit greasy at first but, but will get soaked in.</li>
      <li>I anticipate buying more in the future as it works well too!</li>
      <li>: Just don&#x27;t let it get really hot.</li>
      <li>but I left it in my car one summer day and now it&#x27;s more gel-like.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>THis is great to have in the car or next to your bed for dry and cracked cuticle&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Mostly my thumbs are just so dry.</li>
      <li>OPI Avoplex Cuticle Oil not only healed them quickly, but even when I stop using it my cuticles stay maintained!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help too much.</li>
      <li>May nails and cuticles are so much healthier now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is oil-based and very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.  </li>
      <li>, so I put on when I know I&#x27;m not going to wash or use my hands much.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it can really help me with my often peeling cuticles.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing…like I wish they would make a whole hand lotion with this smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> easy to store in your purse! not messy, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands oily.  I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Product has a brush application method. Just squeeze the tube and brush across cuticles. Love this product. Not messy, oil comes out well controlled.</li>
    <li> I got this cuticle oil for my ongoing dry cuticles.... Mostly my thumbs are just so dry. I am alway picking at my thumbs and actually pulling skin down all around the tops of the nail. I am now noticing that it is doing damage to the smooth growth of the nail. I saw this brand advertising in a beauty magazine saying it was a Editor Choice for cuticles. I bought the squeeze small tube not the bottle one. I didn&#x27;t realize it has a brush as the applicator.Which is really a nice way to quickly put it on. You squeeze it slightly and it comes thru the brush so you can apply it to the cuticles. I leave it out on the counter for constant use. It seems to helping. The smell is the so nice!! It isn&#x27;t greasy or messy at all. This is nice to put a extra one in the car or purse. I recommend this for any one with dry cuticles. I give it a 4 only beacuse you have a hard time seeing the gel like oil come to the head of the brissels.</li>
    <li> Love this OPI product when my manicurist recommend this. It is convenient to use and gd size to put in your bags or small pouches. Will definitely give them as gifts to my friends and recommend them to use this OPI product.</li>
    <li> Got here quickly and i love it.. great price too! Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to OPI Avoplex Nail Cuticle Oik to Go after I admired her manicure.  She credited her longer nails and perfectly groomed cuticles to the oil.  I tried it and have also had excellent results which are especially helpful in our desert climate.  It&#x27;s easy to apply/use, and I recommend it highly![[ASIN:B000W7EZJS OPI Avoplex Cuticle Oil To Go Nail, 0.25-Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> Love it and smells wonderful! I would order this again anytime!  My nail care lady suggested this and i&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
    <li> Great to carry in our purse.</li>
    <li> My cuticles have never looked better!</li>
    <li> Has completely changed my hand moisturizing routine! I can&#x27;t live without it, and just bought 2 more tubes! A lot goes a long way. A bit greasy at first but, but will get soaked in. The brush applicator provides the right amount of oil to the designated area.</li>
    <li> I like the product and the size is perfect for travel or to just throw in your purse! softens and helps remove excess cuticle easily</li>
    <li> Great packaging for on-the-go. Love the moisture it gives to my cuticles and nails, and the smell is great! Does take a little while to soak in, so I put on when I know I&#x27;m not going to wash or use my hands much.</li>
    <li> Heaven to my cuticiles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for my best friend and for my cousin who suffered from extremely dry and peeling cuticles all their lives. And this literally healed their problem and they now have smooth and healthy cuticles just like me. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone suffering from dry cuticles. It really works!</li>
    <li> I love this cuticle oil.  OPI makes the best products.  My cuticles used to be so dry and brittle, now they feel great.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell and didn&#x27;t help my cuticles at all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help too much.</li>
    <li> Luv this stuff. Makes my cuticles really soft. I wash my hands a lot and my cuticles would get really dry and brittle, but this stuff reversed all of the damage. I put it on every morning before I go to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Just don&#x27;t let it get really hot. Obviously user error, but I left it in my car one summer day and now it&#x27;s more gel-like. It still works, but it&#x27;s thick and not really an oil anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this cuticle oil as it is more of an ointment than a liquid oil.  Keeps my cuticles nice and moisturized.  The size is perfect too for travel.</li>
    <li> I love the small brush applicator. It&#x27;s really soft and feel really good. I just started using it so I don&#x27;t know if it can really help me with my often peeling cuticles. I&#x27;ll update later</li>
    <li> I always keep this in my purse for when my cuticles are looking very dry. It also makes my nails look very healthy.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by the lady who does my nails at a local salon. OPI products are great and the item was exactly as described. It arrived promptly. I will definately be ordering again.</li>
    <li> High quality item, like it a lot</li>
    <li> I love this portable cuticle oil!  I take it in my purse and use it at work, before I go to sleep at night, after doing dishes!  It is wonderful and softens my cuticles within minutes!</li>
    <li> I have terrible cuticles, and this has made a world of difference!  I apply it a few times a day, and my hands look so much nicer and healthier now!</li>
    <li> While I love what it does for my cuticles, it&#x27;s still pretty messy!  Not really an on-the-go product.  Order at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my purse and it&#x27;s great for on the go! It smells amazing…like I wish they would make a whole hand lotion with this smell. I anticipate buying more in the future as it works well too!</li>
    <li> small tube, with a brush as a tip, first squeezed it and got out more than i needed. but now i like it. the oil is almost like a gel consistency. nice and rich.</li>
    <li> Nice and convent. It has a little bit of perfume like smell, but goes away rather quickly. Since I wash my hands so many times a day, this helps keep my cuticles much nicer.</li>
    <li> This particular item is meant to be kept handy in your purse or in your pocket which means that you use it ON THE GO.  However, you cannot rely on this product to moisturize your cuticles if you only apply it when your out and about...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is oil-based and very moisturizing. I have very dry cuticles, so I was looking for something to keep in my purse so that I could apply with ease when I&#x27;m out of the house as a compliment to my day-to-day cuticle care routine.  In all fairness, no product can work if you only use it periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT WHEN I&#x27;M HOME...I use moisturizing hand lotions and any &amp;#34;cuticle oil&amp;#34; such as &amp;#34;Solaroil Cuticle Oil&amp;#34; which I bought a big bottle of about a year ago and I&#x27;m still loving and using it...Well worth the money...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any cuticle oil has to be massaged into the cuticles, nails, and the area around the nails. A good cuticle oil, such as this one, is not supposed to magically soak into your cuticles instantaneously. You are also supposed to use cuticle oil several times a day, and on a good day I use cuticle oils 4-6 times, particularly after washing my hands or having them in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this product is package very well, there is no mess when applying and all you have to do to apply it is squeeze gently, if you don&#x27;t get enough, squeeze it again, no big deal...The smell is pleasant, not strong at all.  It is a little expensive for the amount but you are paying for the convenience of being able to take it with you, no fuss, no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is an item I will always have in my nail kit in my purse.  I find that it is not cost effective to use it around the house, but then again, its not made for that so I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really picky about getting the best product for my needs and this cuticle oil is definitely THE BEST! I&#x27;ve had really bad cuticles for years now and i&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions to heal them (even foot creams). OPI Avoplex Cuticle Oil not only healed them quickly, but even when I stop using it my cuticles stay maintained! It&#x27;s definitely worth buying- not only because it works great but also because it&#x27;s at a good price and the packaging makes it easy to take (and use) anywhere.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  Perfect for cuticles on fingers and toes. Use daily for best effect and massage in well.</li>
    <li> Convenient application and smells really nice. Since using this product I haven&#x27;t snagged any cuticles and they are really soft and easy to trim.</li>
    <li> My nails have never been longer or stronger.  Use it twice a day; only takes a second and is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best cuticle oil I have ever used.  My cuticles were all split and I had too many hang nails to count.  Using this product for one week two to three times a day healed my cuticles and they are now beautifully healthy.  I continue using it to keep my cuticles healthy.</li>
    <li> This is the best product.  It stays on the skin, leaving my dry cuticles soft and healthy.  It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t run all over the place.  I&#x27;ll purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Kept this item in my purse pocket and used it whenever I had a free moment, especially right before bed.  My nails showed remarkable improvement within days.</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot. It can come out a bit inconsistently...sometimes clumpy, sometimes runny. But I like the soft smell and it does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a convenient way to put oil on my cuticles. I keep it in my purse.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product that I plan to keep in my purse and with manicure supplies.  It is easy to apply to cuticles.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! The second I opened the box, I applied the oil to my cuticles and I saw results IMMEDIATELY!!! All the dry, cracked skin was now smooth and the smell of the oil is ohhh sooo wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied more around bedtime and in less than 24 hours, I already saw my cuticles improving and staying soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very bad habit of picking the skin around my nails, and will this oil, my skin stays smooth and there is no dry skin to peel. I will be ordering more of this when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and excellent price!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I thought it would be, cutile oil that keeps my manicure looking fresh. OPI makes a great product so i knew when i ordered it that i would be satisfied with the results. The reason it gets 5 stars is package desgin and easy of use. It&#x27;s compact and fits nicely into my every day purse or an evening clutch. The application method ensures you get just the right amount of oil without waste. I would recommend this product to a friend and I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite cuticle oil on the go and I snatch it up when I find it cause it is always sold out!  Let me just say that it works a hundred times better than any of the cuticle oils like Sally Hansen, Mavala, Solar Oil on and on.  I don&#x27;t know what it is but it simply makes an instant and dramatic improvement in the look of your cuticles and nails, even if not painted!  I carry this everywhere and have a back up by my office keyboard.  I use it when sitting in morning traffic, dab a bit on each nail and simply rub it in.  It only takes a tiny drop.  The oil is thick and not runny so your hands won&#x27;t be a mess.  Best traffic ritual ever!  :-)</li>
    <li> this kept my nail beds moist and healthy looking</li>
    <li> Going to Amazon is a great way to purchase an otherwise very expensive cuticle oil!  I love the plastic \\&quot;no leak\\&quot; tube that it comes in and carry it in my purse for on the go use and in both my cars, in the master bath and even have a tube secreted in my living room.  Prevents hangnails and keeps my nails looking good all of the time.  Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> THis is great to have in the car or next to your bed for dry and cracked cuticle&#x27;s.  I would totally load up on this!</li>
    <li> I needed something desperately and this product did just the trick. May nails and cuticles are so much healthier now. My only complaint is that the oil starts to congeal in the tube. When I first used it the oil was...well oil. Now its thick clumpy gunk. Not so pleasant but it still does its job nicely. I just make sure to wipe it all off before leaving, when it dries it looks crazy nasty.</li>
