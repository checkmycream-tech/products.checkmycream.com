      <li>but no electric is perfect.</li>
      <li>What great service!</li>
      <li>For the price, it has the best features and performance.</li>
      <li>He is very happy with this one.</li>
      <li>Having a trimmer which floats along with floating screens, is brilliant and it works</li>
      <li>A great shaver for people who want ability to use battery or corded.</li>
      <li>It works great and shaves great.  </li>
      <li>No store in the great metro area carried it, knew about it, etc.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, they have refunded the cash already, even though we;re still waiting for Fedex to pick the return up...    </li>
      <li>product works good</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for.  </li>
      <li>As is often the case, this Remington provides a good close shave.  </li>
      <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>I love this shaver!  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband and he really liked it.  </li>
      <li>It was a nice looking razor but it didn&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>Buy another kind of electric razor from them.</li>
      <li>The razor gives a nice close shave, and comes with an ear and nose trimmer to boot, but the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
      <li>, the shaver still works great, the battery is at about 2/3 of the original capacity, but not the screen.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best model Remington shaver I have ever used [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Braun and Panasoic feel better build.</li>
      <li>It is beyond my comprehension why would Remington try to sell a model with a charging system inferior to the twice cheaper model and on top of that it doesn&#x27;t shave better.</li>
      <li>But the Remington makes it much more bearable and gives a close shave.  </li>
      <li>I wonder if the 5200 just doesn&#x27;t have to many bells &amp; whistles.</li>
      <li>But the third \\&quot;mini\\&quot; foil is cumbersome at best and not at all helpful.  </li>
      <li>It replaced a Remington M2830 Intercept razor that I very happily used for several years.  </li>
      <li>all ok, no problems, recharge after about 12-14 shaves, screen</li>
      <li>Also more compact, easier to pack for travel than many on the market.</li>
      <li>I like to shave with this shaver,but it will not hold a charge for me any more.</li>
      <li>I do like the many features it has.</li>
      <li>So I am debating if it&#x27;s worthwhile to get the screen at all...</li>
      <li>The shaver would not hold a charge for more than three uses even though it was advertised for 20 uses before recharging.  </li>
      <li>Build a better shaver Remmington</li>
      <li>I have been using Remington Shavers for many years.  </li>
      <li>I am sure it is a great shaver, but I ordered it for my 94 year old father who is vision impaired.</li>
      <li>New one is absolutely the best, closer shaves, easier to use.  </li>
      <li>It arrived very, very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have resorted to wrapping a strong rubberband around the body to help hold the trimmer down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gives me a good fast smooth shave.</li>
      <li>The merchant was fine to deal with.  </li>
      <li>&quot; the beard but works just fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The most useful feature for me; is the fact that the trimmer has a setting where it \\&quot;floats\\</li>
      <li>That feature wasn&#x27;t that important to me</li>
      <li>it has a light on it to show when it needs recharging.</li>
      <li>Not as good as my old Titanium shaver.</li>
      <li>if you order one today in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that the build quality does not feel like a Braun, but the very well thought out features make it the most convenient, easy shaving (as well as close shaving)</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget my original statement, You have to keep it plugged in</li>
      <li>The pop-up trimmer on this model is great and you can tell it will hold up for a long time.</li>
      <li>but he liked the way this one shaved and decide to give a new one a try.    </li>
      <li>last good</li>
      <li>This shaver is supposed to run for 55 minutes after a full charge, with an added 5 minutes after pressing the \\&quot;plus\\&quot; button.    </li>
      <li>It does shave fairly well, but, having it constantly plugged in and on my vanity 24/7</li>
      <li>This shaver does a good job of shaving my beard, but the battery charger lights don&#x27;t properly indicate the state of charge.</li>
      <li>I have used Remington electrics for many, many years and my current  MS3-2700 would run for close to 2 weeks of shaves between charges.  </li>
      <li>fast, clean, easy to get the shaver in and out of the station, and does charge and wash separately.</li>
      <li>They also claim &#x27;Quick Charge&#x27; feature, mind takes eight hours.  </li>
      <li>Though it is louder and has more vibration than my new shaver, the longevity of this should speak for itself.  </li>
      <li>I need to find another razor after I get through the 4 packs of replacement blades I bought that won&#x27;t fit any of the newer razors, Thanks Remington.</li>
      <li>Mkaes shaving almost fun.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a plain Jane but is working great.</li>
      <li>I bought this electric razor for my elderly husband (his first electric razor)for quick touch-ups and for me to shave him with in case he is not up to it.    </li>
      <li>They sent a new shaver and it works fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update 2: I purchased new cutters and a new screen head to give my favorite, yet crippled, shaver</li>
      <li>New parts NOT recommend.y favorite, yet crippled, shaver some new life and do my face a favor.</li>
      <li>Luckily Remington did send me a new model but it was not near as nice as this one.</li>
      <li>There must be some sort of fluke where the battery won&#x27;t charge initially since many people have had this problem.</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life, I am considering leaving Remington for another brand.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t try to use this shaver on anything over a 2-day beard, unless you really like pain!    </li>
      <li>3 years ago, I bought my son his first Remington, expecting to carry on the tradition.  </li>
      <li>It is quiet and smooth and it gives a really close and comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>The first one I ordered would not hold its charge, at all.  </li>
      <li>the first shaver I received would not accept a charge at all.  </li>
      <li>But unfortunately, no one shaves as close as Remington)    </li>
      <li>On top of that, the shaver needs 12 hours for recharging while my MS2 370 charges in an hour and in 5 minutes is charged enough for a shave if you are in a hurry.</li>
      <li>The first MS5200 shipped to me was charged as per the instructions for 24 hours and showed a 100% charge.  </li>
      <li>The shaving head is excellent, a nice close shave, that is the reason I purchased this particular unit as I had one just like it before, but I am very unhappy with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
      <li>I decided to buy a new unit when, after about 5 years of service, it began to need recharging more frequently - every 7 days or so - and I figured the battery was beginning to die.  </li>
      <li>Certainly as good as my old one and the popup small shaver is great for getting odd places</li>
      <li>Although quite loud, the Remington MS-5200 gives me a very close and comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>The initial week or so, battery ran out very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The new one is loud but it works OK, so far.</li>
      <li>(Side note, among all the auto cleaning systems, the one comes with the Braun 8000 series really works:</li>
      <li>I am replacing a Norelco rotary, which did not give me a very close shave.  </li>
      <li>Thanks,  </li>
      <li>Really like the portability of the battery operation, plus knowing it will not overcharge if I keep it hooked up.  </li>
      <li>Does not recharge as fast as advertized.</li>
      <li>He did that (kept the cord handy to plug it in, if it stopped mid-shave) &amp; within a few weeks the battery time had gone up a lot.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use and has a long battery charge.</li>
      <li>so well I sincerely hope other models adopt this three position</li>
      <li>This shaver is not any noisier than any other electric shaver that I had, and I had many.</li>
      <li>(The new Norelcos have the similar problems - look and feel cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s noisy, but I can live with that if it didn&#x27;t have so many other deficiencies.  </li>
      <li>I have been a loyal Remington user ever since I could 1st shave in the 80&#x27;s and even had an earlier version of this model</li>
      <li>Shave time to get a decent shave is lengthy.  </li>
      <li>Remington gave a free alternate model and didn&#x27;t ask me to return the old one.  </li>
      <li>For an every day shaver, I suppose it could get high reviews.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean with wet or dry methods.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product never worked at all.  I called Remington and was told that the battery was dead,   couldn&#x27;t be charged and was a discontinued model.  They offered to replace it by me sending them only a copy of the invoice.  This is what I did.  They sent a new shaver and it works fine.</li>
    <li> The product shipped to me was a discontinued model.  It would not hold a charge so was unusable.  I contacted Remington and they replaced the unit with an up to date product.  Not a good experience.</li>
    <li> Be careful when selecting this product via Amazon.      The first one I ordered would not hold its charge, at all.  10/10 for the no-cost return service from Amazon.    Second one was advertised as having bonus ear and nose trimmer, but according to the the supplier, that was a mistake on Amazon&#x27;s part and arrived sans bonus package.  To be fair, they have refunded the cash already, even though we;re still waiting for Fedex to pick the return up...    I got the same shaver for the same price (54USD) and free shipping elsewhere, including the freebie Ear/Nose trimmer.    The battery on this third attempt is still not stellar and the charge indicator is not to be relied upon hence the one star. (it is noisy like my 10 year old one) - I just can&#x27;t be fussed to return it a third time.</li>
    <li> product works good but there was a cupon iin it that expired in 2008.  This is to long for a product with a battery in it.</li>
    <li> A complete waste of time and effort. The battery would not accept a charge. Had to return it. I did receive a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for over a year now.  It replaced a Remington M2830 Intercept razor that I very happily used for several years.  Can&#x27;t say how disappointed I was, and still am, in the switch.    Shave time to get a decent shave is lengthy.  It&#x27;s noisy, but I can live with that if it didn&#x27;t have so many other deficiencies.  This shaver often misses whiskers in between my chin and neck -I find them when they get long enough to be called &#x27;hairs&#x27;.  Don&#x27;t try to use this shaver on anything over a 2-day beard, unless you really like pain!    The pop-up trimmer isn&#x27;t getting the job done either.     Pros:  Battery life is acceptable.    Cons:  Long shave time, misses whiskers, cannot handle long whiskers.</li>
    <li> I have owned this MS-5200 for about three years now and all features still work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this model has been discontinued by Remington, so I&#x27;m not sure what you get if you order one today in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that the build quality does not feel like a Braun, but the very well thought out features make it the most convenient, easy shaving (as well as close shaving) electric razor I have ever owned. And, I&#x27;ve owned most all the brands over the past forty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most useful feature for me; is the fact that the trimmer has a setting where it \\&quot;floats\\&quot; at the same height and along with, the twin foils. This allows one to trim and shave longer whiskers in one, single operation. What a time saver! The trimmer may also be locked in a high position above the foils for normal trimming, or locked down and disengaged. Having a trimmer which floats along with floating screens, is brilliant and it works so well I sincerely hope other models adopt this three position trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another unique feature of this quality shaver is its third small pop-up foil. This 3/4\\&quot; wide mini-shaver can be very handy in close areas, as between the top of a mustache and the base of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons have nothing to do with shaving, but include - a terrible screen guard which barely fits and is quite insecure. Also, the soft case is poorly designed and requires too much effort to fit the charger/cord and shaver inside so it may be snapped closed. A little more room please, Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this model for it&#x27;s close shave, its time saving convenience features and relative durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 3+ years the (very usefull) pop-up trimmer refuses to stay in its locked down position, nececatating holding it down while shaving. No fun. I have resorted to wrapping a strong rubberband around the body to help hold the trimmer down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: I purchased new cutters and a new screen head to give my favorite, yet crippled, shaver some new life and do my face a favor. They were costly, what&#x27;s new. Inexplicably - the shaver works little better than with the old, worn out parts !! I feel ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the inability to renew its shaving performance and the continued problem with the unruly trimmer -- I&#x27;m back to a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you buy / bought this shaver; just retire it when it gets dull. New parts NOT recommend.y favorite, yet crippled, shaver some new life and do my face a favor. They were costly, what&#x27;s new.

    <li> I bought the new Remington Microscreen 700 / MS-5200  to replace the Remington MS3 1700 which became slow and kept  dying on me. The new one is loud but it works OK, so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington Shavers for many years.  This is by far the best model Remington shaver I have ever used [[ASIN:B000ITM8J4 Remington MS5200 Titanium MicroScreen Shaver with Bonus Nose and Ear Trimmer]].  It is quiet and smooth and it gives a really close and comfortable shave.  I received the shaver from The Shaver Outlet in just a few days.  The shaver would not hold a charge for more than three uses even though it was advertised for 20 uses before recharging.  I sent an email to the Shaver Outlet and they sent me a replacement shaver in less than one week.  What great service!</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Remington user ever since I could 1st shave in the 80&#x27;s and even had an earlier version of this model but this one broke after 3 only months. The part of the shaver that houses the micro screens broke on the latches so they no longer could hold the screen in place.  I contacted Remington and they informed me that this razor was from 2005 and no longer in production. Nowhere on this page from this seller do they inform that you they are selling an old model (MS5200) or that is no longer produced. This seller did NOT offer any type of help after I contacted them. Luckily Remington did send me a new model but it was not near as nice as this one. It was just a basic version of their MicroScreen Shaver.  So just wanted to share my experience. Be wary because this is an old model that is no longer produced and even though it has lots of cool features it is not as reliable as all the Remington razors I&#x27;ve had over the past 20 years.</li>
    <li> Remmington MS5200 is not worth the money. The thrid pop up mini foil will break. It will break via the vibration and will not close back down in position. Vibrates back up and becomes a lead blade wich is quite uncomfortable. I pulled mine out. Now its a two blade. I had previous Remmington&#x27;s which worked great with the three blades and a pop up trimmer, but were poorly designed as the trimmer suffered the same result as this crappy pop up foil.. vibration and plastic dont mix.  Build a better shaver Remmington</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I bought it for Christmas.  It arrived very, very quickly.  It offers a high quality shave.  It is quiet, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Replaced husbands old MS 5100 (which could only be used on battery power) with this one that can be used corded or uncorded.  He is very happy with this one. The initial week or so, battery ran out very quickly.  Had read another review on here about that, which stated that would happen but by running battery totally out over &amp; over, it would start lasting longer.  He did that (kept the cord handy to plug it in, if it stopped mid-shave) &amp; within a few weeks the battery time had gone up a lot.  I think it&#x27;s up to lasting almost a week without a charge!  Probably depends on how long a person uses it. A great shaver for people who want ability to use battery or corded. Also more compact, easier to pack for travel than many on the market.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a good job of shaving my beard, but the battery charger lights don&#x27;t properly indicate the state of charge. The battery runs out of power when the lights indicate that there is still 80% charge left. It is then necessary to shave with the cord plugged into the wall outlet. The \\&quot;reserve\\&quot; button does not allow the shaver to continue running as it is described in the manual.</li>
    <li> The razor gives a nice close shave, and comes with an ear and nose trimmer to boot, but the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.  Remington went bankrupt, and shipped a bunch of defective product out before they did.  The merchant was fine to deal with.  Buy another kind of electric razor from them.</li>
    <li> I got a replacement due to only 5 mins operation on battery.  2nd one had same problem.  Remington gave a free alternate model and didn&#x27;t ask me to return the old one.  I let it sit for some months.  Then I charged it and it started working!  Go figure.  No problems since.  There must be some sort of fluke where the battery won&#x27;t charge initially since many people have had this problem.</li>
    <li> Bought a Titanium shaver. The battery lasted 6mos. Contacted Remington and received a new shaver which broke down completely in less than a year. Remington has \\&quot;outsourced\\&quot; its manufacturing to China. The Titanium we puirchased was junk!</li>
    <li> I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS RAZOR EXCEPT THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T HOLD A CHARGE  FOR VERY LONG  AND THE SIDEBURN CLIPPER IS PLACED ON THE RAZOR IN A VERY  INCONVENIENT PLACE.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this shaver a lot! Very happy with how it shaves. it has a light on it to show when it needs recharging. you can shave with out the cord plugged in. A big plus for him.</li>
    <li> I have been a Remington Customer for nearly 50 years.  3 years ago, I bought my son his first Remington, expecting to carry on the tradition.  Then, I bought the MS-5200.  It HOWLS like a small airplane.  I expected THREE SHAVING HEADS, but got only TWO.  The little one is useless, YANKING at the mustache hairs, painfully.  The RPMs on this one are similar to a hand lawn mower.  This is very painful for me, because after 50 years, I feel like I have to try something else, perhaps buying Braun next time.  What ever happened to \\&quot;shaves as close as a blade\\&quot;?  Believe it or not, the company sends a piece of paper with this one, cautioning:  \\&quot;Take a month to yet used to it!\\&quot;  WHAT?  Did they KNOW what a horrid device this was when they shipped it?</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say that I was fully disappointed in the Remington 5200 I received on line from Amazon. When it arrived, the head was broken. The person for whom it was a gift, fixed that but when he tried to use the razor, it would not work. He tried time and again to recharge the battery, but it would not take a charge. He tried to send it back, but the dealer said he would pay my friend $20 to keep it and forget the problem.   Needless to say, I am surprised that a Remington dealer would send such a product and then treat the issue as he did.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old Titanium shaver. Battery does not last as long as advertized. The shave is not as close as the old Titanium shaver. Does not recharge as fast as advertized.</li>
    <li> I am 82, used remington all my adult life.  Old one finally wore out after refurbishing it several times.  New one is absolutely the best, closer shaves, easier to use.  Really like the portability of the battery operation, plus knowing it will not overcharge if I keep it hooked up.  Thanks,  but I had to do a lot of searching to find this online.  No store in the great metro area carried it, knew about it, etc.  It was if you see what you want, we will take your money.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington electrics for many, many years and my current  MS3-2700 would run for close to 2 weeks of shaves between charges.  I decided to buy a new unit when, after about 5 years of service, it began to need recharging more frequently - every 7 days or so - and I figured the battery was beginning to die.  Little did I know that Remington now ships them dead already.    The first MS5200 shipped to me was charged as per the instructions for 24 hours and showed a 100% charge.  It lasted through about 12 total minutes of shaving and started to die.  Pressing the \\&quot;plus\\&quot; button which is supposed to give you an added five minutes resulted in the unit ceasing to run at all.  I re-charged the shaver for another 24 hours and only got about 10 minutes of shaving before it too was completely dead.  This shaver is supposed to run for 55 minutes after a full charge, with an added 5 minutes after pressing the \\&quot;plus\\&quot; button.    I exchanged for another unit and this one only lasted about 7 minutes (not even 2 shaves) after the initial 24 hour charge.  It is going back for a refund.    And how is it that the older model only needs about an hour or two to fully charge while this newer model needs 24 hours?  Stay away from this clunker.</li>
    <li> Pro:     Shave as close as blades. It may take a while, but it will get the job done. (Based on just my person experience, comparing to Braun 1000, 4000. 500, and 8000, the new Norelco SpeedXL, and Panasoic Linear).    Con:    Poor build quality in all area, look and feel, fits and noise level (loud), shake, power connector, and so on. (The new Norelcos have the similar problems - look and feel cheap. Far less solid than my old faithful Quadra. Braun and Panasoic feel better build. Brauns are pleasure to my eyes and hands. But unfortunately, no one shaves as close as Remington)    And it&#x27;s a shaver after all and it supposes to shave. If this Remington doesn&#x27;t last (I have my reasons to be a bit worried), I will have to get another one of the same. Only hope Remington will at least keep their technology intact over time. (Side note, among all the auto cleaning systems, the one comes with the Braun 8000 series really works: fast, clean, easy to get the shaver in and out of the station, and does charge and wash separately. Too bad Remington doesn&#x27;t come close in the washer technology, and Braun doesn&#x27;t cut as close!)    P.S. I have no beard or mustache, but lots of whiskers in all directions around and under chin. All other shavers I&#x27;ve tried simply won&#x27;t go there. The difference is loud and clear, literally: when the whiskers got cut down, you can hear it. All shavers work great in the initial cutting phase. But Only Remington continues on after that, while all others just do empty runs, and my fingers clearly tell me there&#x27;re more to be cut.    Bottom line: Try it. Don&#x27;t get scared away by the bad raps on the web. I tried Remington as my last resort. And I never regret that I did.    P.S. now it&#x27;s 2009, the shaver still works great, the battery is at about 2/3 of the original capacity, but not the screen. It starts to cut into my skin from time to time. A screen set costs half a shaver. So I am debating if it&#x27;s worthwhile to get the screen at all...</li>
    <li> the first shaver I received would not accept a charge at all.  However, Amazon was very accommodating and sent a 2nd unit at no charge.  It works great and shaves great.  If I had gotten the second unit first, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am having trouble with this shaver. The shaver will charge up okay, but after using the shaver without the cord when the supply power gets down to less then 60% the unit dies and must be recharged. The shaving head is excellent, a nice close shave, that is the reason I purchased this particular unit as I had one just like it before, but I am very unhappy with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> As is often the case, this Remington provides a good close shave.  But the third \\&quot;mini\\&quot; foil is cumbersome at best and not at all helpful.  Most frustrating of all is it&#x27;s inability to hold a charge.  I may have just received a defective unit, but after 2-3 shaves it needs to be fully re-charged.  Not real happy with this unit and will likely switch to a different style of Remington or perhaps go back to a Braun, which I&#x27;ve enjoyed in years past.</li>
    <li> Razor can be used corded or cordless which is a big deal to me.  It&#x27;s easy to clean with wet or dry methods.  It shaves close and the small cutting edge of the top blade allows for small areas to be easily shaved.  For the price, it has the best features and performance.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!  I am replacing a Norelco rotary, which did not give me a very close shave.  I have found it very difficult to get a close shave with virtually any electric shaver.  Not this one!  Although quite loud, the Remington MS-5200 gives me a very close and comfortable shave.  I really like the battery gauge that lets you know how much power is left in the battery.  There is even a feature to give you 5 extra minutes of shaving time if the battery runs down.  If you get down that far and run out of power, you can still use it as a corded shaver.  This one is a keeper.  I may even order an extra one to keep in reserve.</li>
    <li> I am sure it is a great shaver, but I ordered it for my 94 year old father who is vision impaired. The battery did not hold its charge; the mini blade falls off easily during cleaning which for a visually impaired person is a problem, and the carrying case is too small for the shaver and the huge electric cord.</li>
    <li> Overall, a well built shaver, although the &#x27;5 minute reserve&#x27; function hasn&#x27;t worked from day one. That feature wasn&#x27;t that important to me and I didn&#x27;t want to be with out a shaver. I really haven&#x27;t ever had a problem other than than that and it is a solid shaver. I&#x27;ve had the shaver for nearly 2 years. I replaced the blades and screen once, but upon retrospect, I&#x27;m not sure it was really necessary.    I used to own the MS3-4700 (triple screen) which I think gave a better shave, but its pop-up trimmer design was terrible and it broke. The pop-up trimmer on this model is great and you can tell it will hold up for a long time. The one downside to this shaver is the mini-foil. It really is almost useless. I would have preferred that space be used for the triple foil type design of the MS3 models.    Update 2010:  I just replaced this shaver, meaning this lasted me at least 3 years.  Was having to charge it every few days, so I bought a new Panasonic.  Shortly thereafter I ran across a Batteries+ store and purchased 2 new batteries for about $8, soldered them in and gave the shaver to my son.  It still looks new and with the new batteries its back to about 3 or 4 weeks between charges.  Though it is louder and has more vibration than my new shaver, the longevity of this should speak for itself.  For those just now looking at this model in 2010, keep in mind that Remington discontinued this model quite a while ago.  That means that the batteries on a new shaver that&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf for 3 or 4 years likely won&#x27;t hold a charge at this point.</li>
    <li> It was a nice looking razor but it didn&#x27;t work and I had to send it back for credit. I bought another one locally and had trouble with it also. I wonder if the 5200 just doesn&#x27;t have to many bells &amp; whistles. I finally bought a 5100 it&#x27;s a plain Jane but is working great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he really liked it.  However, it would not hold a charge and the powerboost button did not work.  We have returned it for a new one and are waiting for it to arrive.  I asked if he wanted something different but he liked the way this one shaved and decide to give a new one a try.    UPDATE:  We received a new shaver and had exactly the same problem. It would not hold a charge.  Had to send it back again and am waiting on a refund.  Would not recommend this product until they get the glitch fixed. I would change my star rating but the site will not let me.</li>
    <li> I like to shave with this shaver,but it will not hold a charge for me any more. I only had it about five mo. when it stopped keeping a charge. I do like the many features it has.</li>
    <li> this is the second one Ive had in the last 20 years. Both were excelent. Mkaes shaving almost fun.</li>
    <li> My old shaver died after four years so I replaced it with this one.  Takes a few days to \\&quot;train\\&quot; the beard but works just fine.  Certainly as good as my old one and the popup small shaver is great for getting odd places</li>
    <li> razor is insanely loud compared to last razor, first time i have had a microscreen...kinda shaves crappy...not all that impressed but no electric is perfect.</li>
    <li> all ok, no problems, recharge after about 12-14 shaves, screen last good if you&#x27;re gentle with them, don&#x27;t press too hard</li>
    <li> I was hoping this shaver to replace my way cheaper Remington MS2 370 but it didn&#x27;t. It shaves no worse and no better than MS2 370. You can&#x27;t get a shave as close as a blade with electric razor, no matter which brand, but it&#x27;s acceptable. My biggest hope was that the mini-foil will improve shaving under the chin. I am a slim guy and have &#x27;valleys and hills&#x27; there that are hard to shave with the big foils. Unfortunately, the mini-foil is simply incapable of cutting the hairs and I continue to shave the area with the trimmer and then the big foils. On top of that, the shaver needs 12 hours for recharging while my MS2 370 charges in an hour and in 5 minutes is charged enough for a shave if you are in a hurry. It is beyond my comprehension why would Remington try to sell a model with a charging system inferior to the twice cheaper model and on top of that it doesn&#x27;t shave better. What were they thinking in their marketing department ????</li>
    <li> I am writing my MS 5200 shaver review after 90 days of use and I have not regretted it.    I started out with a Schick electric shaver because my father had one and that was 61 years ago. After that I had an electric Sunbeam shaver, then a few electric Remingtons, then a Norelco, which I did not like. I went back to Remington shavers up to this time. I did shave with a wet blade for a few years in the service, no electric shaver shaves as close as that. All of my electric shavers were corded except for two battery Remingtons. I did not like battery shavers until I read one review about this MS 5200, being able to run on a dead battery using a cord immediately and it does, my other battery shavers would not. This shaver is not any noisier than any other electric shaver that I had, and I had many. They claim that it is washable, I doubt I will ever try that. They also claim up to three weeks of cordless running time, I get an average of 12 days. They also claim &#x27;Quick Charge&#x27; feature, mind takes eight hours.  Pro: I like the LED panel displaying percentage of battery remaining, also the quality, the looks and the feel. It gives me a good fast smooth shave. I would buy it again and through Amazon.    Con: The shaver has a 5 minute reserve battery button for extra time, but mine does not work. It claims to have 3 Microsreens, but what you get is 2 1/2. Because of that half screen, I have to turn it upside down to shave square to my sideburns. BTW, the 1/2 screen does shave, probably meant for tight corners, that&#x27;s probably all it&#x27;s good for.  Russ.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor for my elderly husband (his first electric razor)for quick touch-ups and for me to shave him with in case he is not up to it.    We gave it the two-week \\&quot;getting used to\\&quot; and I personally was disappointed in the end results.  For an every day shaver, I suppose it could get high reviews.  But if you don&#x27;t shave every day, FORGET this model because you can shave and shave and there will still be whiskers.  I bought a couple different types of skin bracers and finally, I sometimes use my Lady Remington to shave the \\&quot;impossible\\&quot; whiskers and it does the job in one sweep.    We will keep it, but I would not purchase this model again for either my husband or son.</li>
    <li> The Battery doesn&#x27;t last very long and eventually you have to have it plugged in constantly. If you unplug it and put it away and take it out the next day to shave, it will take about an hour to get enough juice into the battery to stay running. Don&#x27;t forget my original statement, You have to keep it plugged in 24/7 or it won&#x27;t stay on when you want to shave. This is the worst Remington I have ever owned. It does shave fairly well, but, having it constantly plugged in and on my vanity 24/7 is using electricity that same 24/7/365. I need to find another razor after I get through the 4 packs of replacement blades I bought that won&#x27;t fit any of the newer razors, Thanks Remington.</li>
    <li> Saludos me falto el bono que es \\&quot;Nose and Ear Trimmer\\&quot; no llego a quien le escribo o como hago por favor</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver and was first very disappointed in the small \\&quot;mini-foil\\&quot; microscreen which is worthless. The mini-foil doesn&#x27;t shave my face at all and is quite uncomfortable. I had expected to have three shaving heads as in all my prior Remington shavers. The shaver also ran slowly and took forever to get a decent shave. After exchanging the first shaver for another one I find that the replacement performs just as poorly.    For the first time in my life, I am considering leaving Remington for another brand.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. Arrived and worked as advertised. I look forward to doing future business with your company.</li>
    <li> But the Remington makes it much more bearable and gives a close shave.  It is easy to use and has a long battery charge.</li>
