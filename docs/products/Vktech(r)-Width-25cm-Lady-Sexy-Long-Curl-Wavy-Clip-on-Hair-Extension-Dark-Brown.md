    <li> Very poor quality, you wear it once it gets tangled and you cant get them out by running your fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt recomend buying this unless you only plan on wearing it once.</li>
    <li> looks very fake with my hair I cant even wear it, the color doesn&#x27;t match my color either me no likey</li>
    <li> I got this for Halloween. It totally matched my hair color and I was so happy with the quality.  People actually thought it was my real hair. I bought two because I wasn&#x27;t sure if one would be thick enough but one was perfect. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> Not the color I expected, and it was very thin. The price should have been the first clue.  The texture wasn&#x27;t too bad...</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  The hair was like Barbie doll hair. I would never buy this again. It is not like the hair that is on the picture.</li>
    <li> The quality of this is very low. It looks completely fake and it is not usable at all. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I was told it would be dark brown but it was definitely black. It was very heavy too. It doesn&#x27;t blend or look real like in the picture. I would only recommend to wear this at a party or something. And you shouldn&#x27;t expect it to look real. It looks fake.</li>
    <li> I didnt like the product it doensnt look llike on the picture, be more specific ln what you guys sell</li>

    <li> If you are black don&#x27;t buy this its just like the picture either for asian girls or white girls and remeber its a clip in not a full wig</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good wig but the slightest knot creates a giant mess. I had to brush it out and it didn&#x27;t keep its curls.</li>

    <li> This product wasnt good at all. Doesnt look like anything in the picture. It&#x27;s really thin and fake. You need to buy 3 or 4 for to actually look like some type of extension. It does not even reach around your head to look like full extensions makes you look like you have a mullet. I do not recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> My daughter stole it yet, it looks great &amp; works well on her. Lol</li>
