<ol>
      <li>Wonderful soaps and</li>
      <li>This is a top-notch soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are great soaps - but I will have to switch  now that 4 bars of soap cost almost $40!!!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d also know how wonderful they smell.</li>
      <li>a rustic lemon/olive oil wonderfully scented kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they make beautiful gifts.</li>
      <li>The shape of the bar fits nicely in my hand and is perfect for applying to my legs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Olivia care also makes a very nice orange scented soap which I would also recommend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smelled sooo good with an aromatic lemony fragrance just smelling it while in the box as if you were in the kitchen with lemon and olive oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>would be a good choice for gifts, or yourself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this soap!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Wonderful for the winter months when the air is so much drier.</li>
      <li>I love this soap and am thrilled to find it online.  </li>
      <li>Emperor Napoleon directed appointed Chemist Eugene Michel to create a special soap for his beloved wife, the Empress Josephine.</li>
      <li>I have been using their soap on my face for several years now and am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I have used this soap for years, and absolutely love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was even better while bathing.  </li>
      <li>I was so glad to find it again online.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the mandarin scent and that&#x27;s lovely too.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>Lovely smell, but</li>
      <li>The result of Eugene&#x27;s genius is the worldwide famous &amp;#34;Savon de Marseille&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have almost stopped needing lotion with this soap and it leaves a very clean feeling.</li>
      <li>This soap is perfect for dry, wintery skin!</li>
      <li>However, the Verbena has a nice light clean fragrance, which doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.</li>
      <li>best of all, it is easy on dry, aging skin.  </li>
      <li>I love the fresh lemon smell and luxurious lather I get.</li>
      <li>Just depends on packaging available.</li>
      <li>It easily rinses clean, leaves no residue on my skin or my tub, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin soft and smooth and it smells good too.  </li>
      <li>the original soap from Marseille, France.</li>
      <li>And the lemon verbena smells sooo refreshingly clean.</li>
      <li>This unique formula, jealously guarded by generations of soap masters, comes to you in a special blend of natural frangrances from the famous Provence region of France.</li>
      <li>I have lots of other premium luxury soaps with more exotic alluring scents and much more lather</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, lightly fragrant, and moisturizes without leaving a filmy feeling.</li>
      <li>They actually list the ingredients on the box and there is no sodium of any kind in it-</li>
      <li>It was a large bar with attractive pure yellow/white packaging where you could view the soap thru the package opening with a raised imprint of a tree on the top of the soapbar(2nd and 3rd images uploaded by me) which was different packaging compared to the 1st image given here.  </li>
      <li>Bar size is just right.</li>
      <li>These have always been right around $16 for a box of 4</li>
      <li>The soap is particularly nice if you have dry skin because it softens your skin, and relieves itching.</li>
      <li>very gentle on the skin</li>
      <li>The lemony olive oil scent really came out during bathing and lathered decently and you could literally feel the smooth oil on the soapbar.  </li>
      <li>This soap is high quality, gentle and good for everyday use.</li>
      <li>It creates a rich thick lather that is great for shaving in the shower instead of using shaving cream and is gentle enough for all over body use.</li>
      <li>This soap is made from pure olive oil.</li>
      <li>It really smelled and felt like a \\&quot;made in France\\&quot; soap as its package says.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to many soaps - mainly due to the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Olivia Care soaps, and have often given the soaps as fill in gifts.</li>
      <li>I love French milled soap, and was hoping that this soap would help with my dry skin, but it did not, nor was there much of a scent.  </li>
      <li>(I have normal to oily skin).</li>
      <li>but I am so drawn to wanting to only use this soapbar everyday because it feels so smooth with the oil and bubbly with a lot of large bubbly lather</li>
      <li>It is all natural and hypo allergenic, no</li>
      <li>/&gt;nice scent (natural</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a triple milled soap made of 5 simple ingredients, starting off with 100% pure olive oil.</li>
      <li>It takes very little effort to create a rich, creamy lather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely mainly organic natural because when I tried to cut a piece of it, it broke into pieces instead of straight thru like usual non-organic soaps.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My niece, who has eczema, is able to use this soap without irritating her skin.</li>
      <li>it will not dry out your skin.</li>

    <li> Wonderful soaps and they make beautiful gifts.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and am thrilled to find it online.  My daughter gave me a bar to try.  It lasts a long time, I use it in the shower.  I have almost stopped needing lotion with this soap and it leaves a very clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Have been using it for years. It&#x27;s a triple milled soap made of 5 simple ingredients, starting off with 100% pure olive oil. There aren&#x27;t 50 chemical ingredients that you can&#x27;t pronounce. This soap is high quality, gentle and good for everyday use. It takes very little effort to create a rich, creamy lather. It easily rinses clean, leaves no residue on my skin or my tub, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized (I have normal to oily skin). It makes for a luxurious bathing experience. And the lemon verbena smells sooo refreshingly clean. I&#x27;ve also tried the mandarin scent and that&#x27;s lovely too. My niece, who has eczema, is able to use this soap without irritating her skin. Don&#x27;t let the unpretentious package design fool you. This is a top-notch soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The Story of this Soap. The year was 1805. Emperor Napoleon directed appointed Chemist Eugene Michel to create a special soap for his beloved wife, the Empress Josephine. The result of Eugene&#x27;s genius is the worldwide famous &amp;#34;Savon de Marseille&amp;#34; the original soap from Marseille, France. This unique formula, jealously guarded by generations of soap masters, comes to you in a special blend of natural frangrances from the famous Provence region of France. This soap is made from pure olive oil. Some people call it a miracle cure. Rich in Calcium and Vitamin E, it has been used since time immemorial as a beauty secret for the face and body. It is all natural and hypo allergenic, no coloring.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I usually get these from Marshalls/TJ Maxx. Box of 4 bars for $7.99 or sometimes box of 3 bars for $6.99. Just depends on packaging available. When I find them, I stock up!</li>
    <li> I sent these to my sister for her birthday, and she LOVES them!  If only Amazon were scratch and sniff....I&#x27;d also know how wonderful they smell.</li>
    <li> I love French milled soap, and was hoping that this soap would help with my dry skin, but it did not, nor was there much of a scent.  I will not buy this soap again.</li>
    <li> We like everything about this soap except the price.</li>
    <li> I bought my single 8 oz version at Marshall&#x27;s for $3.99 without s/h costs.  It was a large bar with attractive pure yellow/white packaging where you could view the soap thru the package opening with a raised imprint of a tree on the top of the soapbar(2nd and 3rd images uploaded by me) which was different packaging compared to the 1st image given here.  It&#x27;s definitely mainly organic natural because when I tried to cut a piece of it, it broke into pieces instead of straight thru like usual non-organic soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled sooo good with an aromatic lemony fragrance just smelling it while in the box as if you were in the kitchen with lemon and olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was even better while bathing.  The lemony olive oil scent really came out during bathing and lathered decently and you could literally feel the smooth oil on the soapbar.  Unlike \\&quot;made in Italy\\&quot; oil soaps I&#x27;ve tried, there was no off-putting detergent smell.  It really smelled and felt like a \\&quot;made in France\\&quot; soap as its package says.  It moistened my skin. I have lots of other premium luxury soaps with more exotic alluring scents and much more lather but I am so drawn to wanting to only use this soapbar everyday because it feels so smooth with the oil and bubbly with a lot of large bubbly lather and it feels and smells like \\&quot;home\\&quot; - a rustic lemon/olive oil wonderfully scented kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it for aromatherapy (just as its ad says), to give it as a gift for a friend or myself, to give it as a gift to someone with dry skin, and to use it as an everyday soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any soap, if you want to have it last longer, keep it away from water and get a soapholder with holes on the bottom so the water doesn&#x27;t stay to liquefy the soap.</li>
    <li> Some years ago I found this soap from Provence.  I have been looking for it since.  I was so glad to find it again online.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for years, and absolutely love how it makes my skin feel. I am allergic to many soaps - mainly due to the fragrance. However, the Verbena has a nice light clean fragrance, which doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies. The soap is particularly nice if you have dry skin because it softens your skin, and relieves itching. I highly recommend Olivia Care soaps, and have often given the soaps as fill in gifts.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth and it smells good too.  My mom also loves it.  Doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum in theshower either.</li>
    <li> I have been using their soap on my face for several years now and am very happy with it.  They actually list the ingredients on the box and there is no sodium of any kind in it- it will not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  My skin is smoother and the soap lasts forever in the shower.  Sorry I can&#x27;t find it in my local stores anymore.</li>
    <li> My sister gave me a box of 4 bars of the verbena scented soap for Christmas last year (2010). I love the fresh lemon smell and luxurious lather I get.It creates a rich thick lather that is great for shaving in the shower instead of using shaving cream and is gentle enough for all over body use. The shape of the bar fits nicely in my hand and is perfect for applying to my legs. One bar lasts quite a long time if you don&#x27;t let it sit in water, as I&#x27;m only on my second bar well into October 2011. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face but after reading the reviews here, I will definitely be trying it.</li>
    <li> These are great soaps - but I will have to switch  now that 4 bars of soap cost almost $40!!!!  These have always been right around $16 for a box of 4 - so guess I won&#x27;t be buying these anymore!</li>
    <li> Have used this soap for a number of years. Wonderful for the winter months when the air is so much drier.</li>
    <li> This soap is perfect for dry, wintery skin! It&#x27;s gentle, lightly fragrant, and moisturizes without leaving a filmy feeling. I love it!</li>
    <li> very gentle on the skin&lt;br /&gt;no weird, or harse ingredients&lt;br /&gt;nice scent (natural scent)&lt;br /&gt;everyone loves lemon! would be a good choice for gifts, or yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Olivia care also makes a very nice orange scented soap which I would also recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap because any other soap dries his skin and causes him to itch, but this price is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> Even my Husband likes this soap.  Lovely smell, but best of all, it is easy on dry, aging skin.  Bar size is just right.</li>
