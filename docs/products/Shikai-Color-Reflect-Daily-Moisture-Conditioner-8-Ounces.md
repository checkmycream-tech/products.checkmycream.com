<li> A MESS.</li>
<li> If you decide to try it but have frizzy or very thick curly hair use a little less than necessary, then try Oscar Blandi&#x27;s Jasmine Hair oil to get your hair to lay a little smoother.</li>
<li> I also use a little of it as leave in conditioner too for the ends.</li>
<li> Just not worth it--for me at least.</li>
<li> I was looking for a less expensive product than my usual Redken and it turned out to be a big, fat mistake.  </li>
<li> I usually can tolerate a bit of weigh or product buildup</li>
<li> This was not good for me whatsoever.  </li>
<li> I used to buy really expensive salon/designer conditioner</li>
<li> but this was the worst.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair terrible</li>

    <li> This was not good for me whatsoever.  I usually can tolerate a bit of weigh or product buildup but this was the worst.  I have 3b/c hair curly hair.  When I first used it I sat under the showerhead to rinse it out for what seemed like a week.  At the point that I&#x27;d given up seeing that my hair was not going to lose it&#x27;s heaviness unless I rewashed my hair and I had no time, I tried to get out of the shower at that point and almost slipped and bust my *ss as my tub felt like I poured Crisco in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what ingredient or combination of ingredients caused the disaster but wow this is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally I went to work with my hair looking like Thandie Newton in Beloved.  The day could NOT end fast enough.  I usually like to give products one more try for money&#x27;s sake, but I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
    <li> long time user still great, conditions without flatening</li>

    <li> I have thick, coarse hair. This is the first conditioner I have ever found that calms it down and makes it feel soft. I just love this conditioner!</li>
    <li> I used to buy really expensive salon/designer conditioner but I decided to switch to natural products. I found that reg products, such as Redken, seemed to work well but in the end dried my hair out in the long term causing me to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this at whole foods but it is cheaper to get a 3 pack thru amazon. This keeps my hair soft and doesnt require much, it is very rich. I also use a little of it as leave in conditioner too for the ends. Smells good but not strong.

    <li> I was looking for a less expensive product than my usual Redken and it turned out to be a big, fat mistake.  This conditioner flattened and dulled my very thick, curly, healthy hair.  Never again. Pay the price and get something better.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and I use it every day.  My hair is really shiny, soft and manageable.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years because it&#x27;s a good product from a good company. No harsh chemicals, no animal products/testing. It leaves hair soft, has a nice pleasant scent. As we age the texture of our hair changes. The product is good for all colored treated hair types but I guess the results depends on individual&#x27;s texture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other kinds, but I come back to this one time and time again. It makes my hair silky and smooth and light. I love it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner seems OK  but nothing special.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair terrible but it also doesn&#x27;t make it super nice.  When using after the shampoo it did seem to make my hair somewhat smoother and softer...but perhaps the shampoo was just drying.    For the price, it is worth trying I guess.  I ordered it as a subscribe and save subscription, but canceled my subscription after the first batch.  Just not worth it--for me at least.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have found. Very light but makes my hair soft and shiny. Combined with the shampoo- a winner!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS, THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT, SINCE I HAD USED THE OTHER CONDITIONER, AND THIS WAS HORRIBLE. IT DID NOT DETANGLE MY HAIR OR ANYTHING. MADE MY HAIR A MESS.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t soften and condition as well as I&#x27;d like</li>
    <li> if you color your hair this brand is a must!</li>
    <li> After I shampoo, my hair always seems to feel dry and coarse.  I use this and it completely changes the texture of my hair!!  It feels soft and shiny!  I like it!</li>
    <li> Love this, but it&#x27;s becoming difficult to find, and the price has gone up tremendously.</li>
    <li> Originally found this at Whole Foods.  Love it.  Makes my hair shiny and silky.  Very hydrating.  Highly recommend.  Shampoo too.</li>
