### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with purchase.</li>

      <li>Barber Shop Fresh is awesome.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s amazing is the scent stays with you well after the shave is over as it seems to also carry a aftershave lotion to it.</li>

      <li>The scent really is nice.  </li>
      <li>I will continue using this kind.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve always liked the aroma.  </li>
      <li>(And while they are at it, they should consider relaunching Surf Spray, a Foamy product from the 1970&#x27;s which had the most memorable scent I ever experienced.)</li>
      <li>I was happy with it, and liked the non-overpowering clean &amp;#34;Barbercide&amp;#34; scent it imparted.</li>
      <li>After using it, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve just returned from a fresh cut from the barber!!!</li>
      <li>Leaves your face feeling clean and smelling great.  </li>
      <li>The scent smells like the old barber shops colognes of the 1940/1950s, and is awesome too smell.</li>
      <li>I love this shaving cream with the barber shop smell.</li>
      <li>gives me a clean,close, comfortable shave!</li>
      <li>It was better.</li>
      <li>I found this about a year ago at a Walgreens (was being discontinued) and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>my favorite shave creams though are still rise shaving cream and burma</li>
      <li>I found the Gillette Foamy Barber Shop shaving cream, and it immediately became my new favorite - has a very nice smell...</li>
      <li>I always loved Gillette, and their other shaving creams are great, but the smell was always blahish or just not there.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was available at more stores.</li>
      <li>it has a great old barber shop smell and shaving with it</li>
      <li>Unlike Colgate, the bottom doesn&#x27;t rust so easily.</li>
      <li>Shop Fresh seems to stick to your skin allowing a nice clean shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a serviceable foam shaving cream - works just fine, BUT</li>
      <li>just hope when these run out it will still be available.</li>
      <li>is fabulous.</li>
      <li>thanks amazon you got such wonderful, helpful products for people</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
      <li>After I used up the last of my Amazon pruchase of the discontinued iconic Colgate shave cream, I turned to Gillette Foamy Barber Shop for the best of the remaining traditional shave creams.</li>
      <li>I cannot imagine shaving with some florescent-colored gel when Barbershop Clean is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette</li>
      <li>It appears that Gillette no longer makes the Barber Shop Clean and all that is available now is the Barber Shop Fresh.  </li>
      <li>Alas........knew it was to good to last.</li>
      <li>And the smell is the true barbershop scent.</li>
      <li>This case of 12 will last for a good while, but after that I will continue my search for something to replace it.  </li>
      <li>But if you want the TRUE scent of barbershop.</li>
      <li>Love the old fashioned smell, but it&#x27;s a bit too strong a smell.  </li>
      <li>They should have an ad about it during the Super Bowl, not some metrosexual gel stuff.</li>
      <li>It comes in a much bigger can and is more of a penetrating soap that does more than a foam ever will.</li>
      <li>The older, better version was &amp;#34;Barbershop Clean&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Amazing how many people really don&#x27;t pay attention to detail and just see a blue can and go for it.</li>
      <li>I was told that it was replaced by a shave cream called Gillette Barber Shop Fresh Shave Cream.  </li>
      <li>After shaving with Barber Shop Fresh shaving cream, you put just a touch of that gel on your face (also comes in lotion format), and it&#x27;s heaven of a smell, and locks it all in.</li>
      <li>I am ordering the Fresh..........</li>
      <li>I tried it, and nothing has changed, and here I am three hours after I shaving smelling as fresh</li>
      <li>Come on, Gillette, hire a brand manager who is over 40 years old and let&#x27;s get some of your great products back.</li>
      <li>This is barbershop fresh.</li>
      <li>Give it a try if you want a fresh smelling shaving cream that helps your blade do its job.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Barbershop Clean shaving cream is like no other shaving cream available.  </li>
      <li>Other products out there may give more beneficial ingredients for your skin, but I actually find that Gillette Foamy Barber Shop gives a better quality shave than more costly products.</li>
      <li>Smells like the old barbershop shaving cream and easy to shave with my dad also likes it..</li>
      <li>I never understand why companies have to mess with and ruin a good thing.    </li>
      <li>When you review the ingredients on the can, you can see that although most are the same, there are a couple of differences.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Gillette foamy cream before, mostly the regular version.  </li>
      <li>The smell is still the same, but the orginal product seemed to permeate the skin more and the smell would stay with you for hours.</li>
      <li>I bought the last 5 or 6 cans they had and have not been able to find it again, until now.</li>
      <li>This is my first can and if it will last for a month, I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
      <li>The scent is outstandingly old-fashioned and far better than any other Foamy product.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something about certain fragrances that bring you back to yesterday once more.</li>
      <li>I have run down my 2 cases of Barber Shop FRESH and was hoping to find some of the real Clean instead of the knockout</li>
      <li>I will reorder the Fresh because it smells good and shaves as good as any other, but I just am not satisfied with the lasting power of it......</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with my previous shaving gel product and wanted to switch back to a shaving foam.  </li>
      <li>I give five out of five stars to both \\&quot;Gillette Foamy Barber Shop Fresh Shave\\&quot; and \\&quot;Gillette Sensitive Skin</li>
      <li>I think so much of it, I am buying the case of 12 and</li>
      <li>It really does the job and the scent</li>
      <li>thanks Amazon, for carrying it.  </li>
      <li>The smell is the same and the shaves I get are almost as close and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Barbosal, most other brands.  </li>
      <li>The original and currently advertised product is called \\&quot;Barber Shop Clean\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Smooth, rich lather....and has an unbelievable smell......</li>
      <li>and I feel this product is close to my old hot latherizer foam.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The fact that it is in such limited distribution (i.e. only available on Amazon) is a sad commentary on Gillete&#x27;s inability to consider why this product wasn&#x27;t more successful in market.</li>
      <li>I read all the rave reviews on Amazon about Barber Shop Fresh and totally agree.</li>
      <li>I have just now started using this new batch.</li>
      <li>Very close, but different.</li>
      <li>The product I purchased from Amazon still has a lot of foaminess to it (sometimes old cans get watery, like the end of the Reddi-Wip can).</li>
      <li>Although the product is still featured on Gillette&#x27;s pages, I fear it is just a matter of time before it is completely discontinued.</li>
      <li>just like the old time barber shops.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick formula is great for heavy shavers with thicker beards.</li>
      <li>I first bought a can of this shaving cream in 2010 from Albertsons because I have a thick beard, and none of the sensitive water based shaving cleans would hold up to a full shave.</li>
      <li>I have just chased rabbits running dozens of false leads for Barber Shop Clean and EVERY one ends up being the Barber Shop Fresh.  </li>
      <li>This new product smells the same</li>
      <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, thanks to Amazon (and the previous reviewers)for helping me discover this particular Foamy variant.</li>
      <li>As my supply was down to one can I tried to buy some more from the supplier I had previously bought from.  </li>
      <li>I am now on my last can and have been searching high and low for it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. Scent is pleasant, not overpowering. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why Gillette stopped making this wonderful shave cream. It really does the job and the scent is fabulous. Thankfully you can still buy it through Amazon as there are no stores around here, Boston, that still sell it. Walgreen&#x27;s was the only merchant that carried it and now they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> October 21, 2014    Time to reorder something...........    I have just chased rabbits running dozens of false leads for Barber Shop Clean and EVERY one ends up being the Barber Shop Fresh.  Amazing how many people really don&#x27;t pay attention to detail and just see a blue can and go for it. It appears that Gillette no longer makes the Barber Shop Clean and all that is available now is the Barber Shop Fresh.  I have run down my 2 cases of Barber Shop FRESH and was hoping to find some of the real Clean instead of the knockout but it is not to be.    I will reorder the Fresh because it smells good and shaves as good as any other, but I just am not satisfied with the lasting power of it......I never understand why companies have to mess with and ruin a good thing.    I am ordering the Fresh..........but I am still not pleased.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Something has changed............I have just now started using this new batch. I must confess that something has changed. The original and currently advertised product is called \\&quot;Barber Shop Clean\\&quot;.......however the product actually shipping is now called \\&quot;Barber Shop Fresh\\&quot;. The can looks the same but it is NOT the same product. Very close, but different. The smell is still the same, but the orginal product seemed to permeate the skin more and the smell would stay with you for hours. This new product smells the same but when you wash your face after shaving, the smell washes off as well, no longer leaving that Barber Shop smell on your face. I still like the product, but will probably not reorder when this case runs out. What I liked before was the lingering scent that stayed for hours. When you review the ingredients on the can, you can see that although most are the same, there are a couple of differences. Apparantly these are what makes the change. Without the lingering smell, there is no real purpose in paying double the price of a standard Gillette cream. This case of 12 will last for a good while, but after that I will continue my search for something to replace it.  Alas........knew it was to good to last. Foiled again!    --------------------------------------------    I loathe standard shaving creams......Barbosal, most other brands.  I found this about a year ago at a Walgreens (was being discontinued) and fell in love with it. Smooth, rich lather....and has an unbelievable smell......just like the old time barber shops.  Leaves your face feeling clean and smelling great.  I bought the last 5 or 6 cans they had and have not been able to find it again, until now. I am now on my last can and have been searching high and low for it. I think so much of it, I am buying the case of 12 and just hope when these run out it will still be available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette foamy cream before, mostly the regular version.  When I got this, I used it on half of my face and regular foamy Gillette on half of my face to see if there was a difference.  This Barber Shop version is really different only in the scent, not in the consistency.  The scent really is nice.  It smells like the aftershave from my grandfathers generation.  If they carried it at Target, I&#x27;d definitely buy it over any of Gillette&#x27;s other creams, perhaps with the exception of lemon lime, which smells very dessert-like.  If I could find both lemon lime and barber shop, I&#x27;d alternate between the two.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream to ever come in a can on the planet earth!  Try it at your own risk.  You will be spoiled for any other aerosol shave cream after that.</li>
    <li> This product has become hard to find in stores, and I believe it&#x27;s only found on Amazon at this point in time. I first bought a can of this shaving cream in 2010 from Albertsons because I have a thick beard, and none of the sensitive water based shaving cleans would hold up to a full shave. Plus, I got tired of the old &#x60;sweaty sports gym\\&quot; smell some brands have or scentless brands. I always loved Gillette, and their other shaving creams are great, but the smell was always blahish or just not there. After using my first can of Barber Shop Fresh, I was unable to find it in the stores again, and I figured it was discontinued into I found it this week on Amazon. Barber Shop Fresh is awesome. It&#x27;s thick formula is great for heavy shavers with thicker beards. The cream doesn&#x27;t dissolve into water one minute after you apply it. Barber  Shop Fresh seems to stick to your skin allowing a nice clean shave. The scent is unbelievable. The scent smells like the old barber shops colognes of the 1940/1950s, and is awesome too smell. What&#x27;s amazing is the scent stays with you well after the shave is over as it seems to also carry a aftershave lotion to it. Two hours after I shave, and people around me still tell me I smell great, and ask me what type of cologne I&#x27;m wearing. With the original Gillette shaving creams the smell is usually gone ten minutes after I shave, if it even is there at all. Amazon sells this product in a pack of eleven, and I recently bought it. I tried it, and nothing has changed, and here I am three hours after I shaving smelling as fresh I can be. I got tired of scentless shaving creams, and that brand \\&quot;Barbasol\\&quot; that is useless for people with heavy thick beards which turns to water even before your razor hits your face. I recently added \\&quot;Gillette Sensitive Skin After Shave Gel\\&quot; to the mix which you can buy on Amazon or in local stores, and it seems to have the same barber shop smell as the cream. After shaving with Barber Shop Fresh shaving cream, you put just a touch of that gel on your face (also comes in lotion format), and it&#x27;s heaven of a smell, and locks it all in. There is no aftershave burn from either product. I give five out of five stars to both \\&quot;Gillette Foamy Barber Shop Fresh Shave\\&quot; and \\&quot;Gillette Sensitive Skin After Shave Gel\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Smells like the old barbershop shaving cream and easy to shave with my dad also likes it..I also gave a can to my son and my  daughters boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Love the old fashioned smell, but it&#x27;s a bit too strong a smell.  Wish it was a bit my subtle.</li>
    <li> After I used up the last of my Amazon pruchase of the discontinued iconic Colgate shave cream, I turned to Gillette Foamy Barber Shop for the best of the remaining traditional shave creams. I was happy with it, and liked the non-overpowering clean &amp;#34;Barbercide&amp;#34; scent it imparted. But then, history repeated. It started disappearing from the drug stores, then the grocery stores. I&#x27;d seen this pattern before.Although the product is still featured on Gillette&#x27;s pages, I fear it is just a matter of time before it is completely discontinued. The product I purchased from Amazon still has a lot of foaminess to it (sometimes old cans get watery, like the end of the Reddi-Wip can). Unlike Colgate, the bottom doesn&#x27;t rust so easily. Unless Colgate gets reintroduced (not gonna happen), this will be my go to shaving cream going forward. Give it a try if you want a fresh smelling shaving cream that helps your blade do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK Gillette . . . after all those nce words, could you PLEASE bring back the disposable Microtrac razors?</li>
    <li> I was using Gillette Barber Shop Close Shave Cream for about the last 10 years.  As my supply was down to one can I tried to buy some more from the supplier I had previously bought from.  I found out that Gillette had discontinued making it.  I was told that it was replaced by a shave cream called Gillette Barber Shop Fresh Shave Cream.  I then found out that Amazon was the only known supplier of the replacement so I ordered 12 cans.  When it arrived I tried it and the only thing I noticed that was not quite as thick as the Barber shop close.  The smell is the same and the shaves I get are almost as close and comfortable.  Hopefully Gillette will not decide to discontinue this replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving cream for 5yrs!! After using it, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve just returned from a fresh cut from the barber!!! Highly recommended!!!! Not sold in stores. I can only purchase it through Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred \\&quot;foamy\\&quot; type shaving creams to gels.  I can no longer find my favorites in stores like CVS or Walgreen&#x27;s. I found the Gillette Foamy Barber Shop shaving cream, and it immediately became my new favorite - has a very nice smell...my wife likes it too!</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream with the barber shop smell. what a wonderful scent it has! I will continue using this kind. along with the gillette foamy lemon lime and barbasol ...my favorite shave creams though are still rise shaving cream and burma shave cream which Both have wonderful aromas!! Burma shave is now defunct.actually it&#x27;s a 1940s shave cream  but you can order it at [...]-which has small bottles of it.(sorry amazon for naming another site but I wish to help people here. thanks)actually rise shave cream is not available in my stores either so I get it at amazon.com. thanks amazon you got such wonderful, helpful products for people here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend gillette foamy shave cream, barber shop. it has a great old barber shop smell and shaving with it gives me a clean,close, comfortable shave!</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Barbershop Clean shaving cream is like no other shaving cream available.  It&#x27;s a serviceable foam shaving cream - works just fine, BUT THE SMELL!!!!  . . . smear some of this on your face and you&#x27;ll instantly be transported back to the days when barbershops were barbershops, not beauty salons, where men got their haircuts in places with manilla-colored posters with drawings of men showing a few different hair cut styles like crew cuts and Princetons, where the door was marked by a real barber pole and where you WEREN&#x27;T seated next to a blathering woman with tin foil in her hair and a chemical smell permeating your senses.  Use this foam and close your eyes: you&#x27;ll see old-timers in chairs arguing about baseball or politics or union issues.  You won&#x27;t be listening to wedding plans and worries about cellulite.  I don&#x27;t know how Gillette captured the old-time barbershop smell of talcum and shaving cream, but this stuff will transport you back to a day when men were men and barbershops were a refuge.  I cannot imagine shaving with some florescent-colored gel when Barbershop Clean is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette apparently intends to discontinue this product.  What a mistake.  Instead of dropping it, they should be featuring it every week during baseball, football and hockey season.  They should have an ad about it during the Super Bowl, not some metrosexual gel stuff. I&#x27;m not alone here - every guy I know who&#x27;s tried this stuff swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette, take a second look.  Support this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thanks Amazon, for carrying it.  After a small country store closed recently nearby, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with my previous shaving gel product and wanted to switch back to a shaving foam.  I really like the smell and the foam is thick and creamy. The lubrication it provides is very good.  This is my first can and if it will last for a month, I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is just great.  It reminds me of the shaving cream the barbers used years ago and I&#x27;ve always liked the aroma.  I just wish it was available at more stores.</li>
    <li> This is a  product that takes you back to a simpler time. There&#x27;s something about certain fragrances that bring you back to yesterday once more. Other products out there may give more beneficial ingredients for your skin, but I actually find that Gillette Foamy Barber Shop gives a better quality shave than more costly products. This product is actually great for shaving, and it seems to reduce nicks and cuts, and leaves you feeling refreshed. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I read all the rave reviews on Amazon about Barber Shop Fresh and totally agree. The scent is outstandingly old-fashioned and far better than any other Foamy product. The fact that it is in such limited distribution (i.e. only available on Amazon) is a sad commentary on Gillete&#x27;s inability to consider why this product wasn&#x27;t more successful in market. (Could it have been marketed poorly the first time around?) If I were Gillette, I would relaunch this great product with an inventive ad campaign letting consumers know how it captures the honesty and authenticity of days gone by. (And while they are at it, they should consider relaunching Surf Spray, a Foamy product from the 1970&#x27;s which had the most memorable scent I ever experienced.) Come on, Gillette, hire a brand manager who is over 40 years old and let&#x27;s get some of your great products back. It would be good for your business!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, thanks to Amazon (and the previous reviewers)for helping me discover this particular Foamy variant. It is absolutely superb and I am glad I have 12 cans of it.</li>
    <li> This is barbershop fresh. The older, better version was &amp;#34;Barbershop Clean&amp;#34;. It was better. But if you want the TRUE scent of barbershop. You need 2 things. Pinaud Clubman aftershave(most local drug stores for 7 bucks), and Pinaud CLUBMAN Shaving cream(online only). It comes in a much bigger can and is more of a penetrating soap that does more than a foam ever will. And the smell is the true barbershop scent. There ya go!</li>
    <li> I was a barber and I feel this product is close to my old hot latherizer foam. Great shave too.</li>
