      <li>Great Results!!!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>However, I found that this massage machine has great results.</li>
      <li>and it felt so good</li>
      <li>Just good for heating skin a bit.</li>
      <li>I  love it!</li>
      <li>I thought I was going to feel kind of e-tingling shots to stimulate and</li>
      <li>The lights get warm...</li>
      <li>Fantastic, glad I bought it!!  </li>
      <li>How do I get more gel pads and where at??</li>
      <li>In just a week my arm looks much better.</li>
      <li>I am not at all sure what it is suppose to be doing Also</li>
      <li>I love it, it did what it said it could.</li>
      <li>I should stuck some more to seel others  to my friends.</li>
      <li>Love the product..</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to return it or make any comments.....</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with this item.</li>
      <li>I have bells palsy and used it 3 or more times a day either the vibration or the tens</li>
      <li>I really gave it a good try even went out and bought the cream that I need for it , followed the instruction to the letter</li>
      <li>and i truely felt it helped with my recovery!</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I do NOT see any significance difference yet, but I am willing to continue to try.</li>
      <li>First off, the instructions are kind of unclear.</li>
      <li>Small and great powerfull combination, good results.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s because its a light.</li>
      <li>I thought it will be more powerful</li>
      <li>I was so excited about this product until I got it.</li>
      <li>It is a realy good item the only problem with my</li>
      <li>plan to do an honest review and report back a month or so from now.</li>
      <li>The silver part doesn&#x27;t get hot or vibrate.</li>
      <li>Overall I am pleased.</li>
      <li>the first time I bought this item, it did not work</li>
      <li>needs more red lights.  </li>
      <li>truly disappointing because I was really looking forward to using and seeing great results!</li>
      <li>This really works.</li>
      <li>Really could use some instructions.</li>
      <li>My skin got smoother, and redueces my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Shipoing was fast.</li>
      <li>Works very well on the face for firming.</li>
      <li>I really like the infrared and ultrasonic massage functionality.  </li>
      <li>The results are seen instantly on arms but on the abdominal area you have to use more frequently.</li>
      <li>I am not even sure the device I received is working correctly since the heating is ever so slight</li>
      <li>Normally when you have something like this you want a conductor, like a gel.so that you do not burn your skin.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a quick fix and do not have the time to spend on doing this daily (maybe even multiple times a day)</li>
      <li>but it was sporatic and far in between.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So grateful that I chose the Amazon Prime option at least because I got a FULL refund.</li>
      <li>I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>

<li> I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
<li> The instruction manual is pretty hard to understand.</li>
<li> but I did that with my Galaxy S4 and didn&#x27;t see anything different other than the 4 red indicator lights that were on.  </li>
<li> I have been using the EMS more than the other modes because I feel very little heat--- and that is very very very little heat from this device, but I can hear a slight humming</li>
<li> it&#x27;s that the lights around it only 1 that goes on the other 3 does not turn  on.</li>
<li> I bought it to address the loose skin on my arms.</li>
<li> It has also worked well to tighten loose skin on my neck..</li>
<li> Honestly, so far it is hard to rate.</li>
<li> not sure about it, hasnt been long enough.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected</li>
<li> This was such a waste of money.</li>
<li> I have other face-lifting/treatment machines.</li>
<li> the only I feel is heat and small vibration.</li>
<li> Item delivered on time, the only think is that I am not sure if all the lights around should be on or just 3.  </li>
<li> slow movements and some pressure is key.</li>
<li> Highly suggest that you not to waste your money like I did!!!!</li>
<li> The translation from Chinese to English is very poor.</li>
<li> I did feel a little shock moving the wire in and out of the hole</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money.</li>
<li> moving the device around while pressing firmly.</li>
<li> the instruction do very little to explain anything.</li>
<li> what so ever and very little heat...</li>
<li> not sure if that is the way it should be.  </li>
<li> so not sure if its working yet.  </li>
<li> please this product made small circles in my face what I do</li>
<li> you can hardly feel it.</li>
<li> i think one would have to use this for at least 6 months to give a review of how it works for wrinkles or anything else ..</li>
<li> And my went down the drain!!!</li>
<li> To Complicated to use for an ordinary people  like me and my wife.  </li>
<li> I read the instruction manual, turned it on and was disappointed big time.&lt;br</li>
<li> Not happy with this purchase</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> I was really disappointed with this.</li>
<li> Terrible so disappointed...</li>
<li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. I didn&#x27;t use all of functions, only the massage. My skin got smoother, and redueces my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Shipoing was fast. I can recommend this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Honestly, so far it is hard to rate. I have had it about 2.5 weeks. I have been using it daily for extended periods of time on differing parts of the body (face, thighs-- front, sides, and rear--, calves, and arms).  I can honestly say that I do NOT see any significance difference yet, but I am willing to continue to try. I have been using the EMS more than the other modes because I feel very little heat--- and that is very very very little heat from this device, but I can hear a slight humming noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to do an honest review and report back a month or so from now. If you are looking for a quick fix and do not have the time to spend on doing this daily (maybe even multiple times a day) I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the purchase. I am not even sure the device I received is working correctly since the heating is ever so slight you can hardly feel it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I  love it!</li>
    <li> This is the coolest thing ever to have at home!! I have bells palsy and used it 3 or more times a day either the vibration or the tens and it felt so good and i truely felt it helped with my recovery!</li>
    <li> I really like the infrared and ultrasonic massage functionality.  There was no way to tell if the infared was actually working though.  I had read online that if you use your smarphone camera and look at it thru the phone camera you could see the infrared lights but I did that with my Galaxy S4 and didn&#x27;t see anything different other than the 4 red indicator lights that were on.  The EMS did not work on any setting.  I did feel a little shock moving the wire in and out of the hole but it was sporatic and far in between.  I think it was the wires but didn&#x27;t want to take any chances so I returned it.</li>
    <li> This was such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> needs more red lights.  not sure about it, hasnt been long enough. in my 5 uses, Im not seeing a difference but that could change over time.&lt;br /&gt;I think a stronger machine is needed though</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I have used it on my abdomen, and it works well.  I follow the schedule of treatments which is used in the medical spa 45 mins per day twice per week, and I can see the difference. moving the device around while pressing firmly. The downside to the device is that it does not have a charger. So, my device was purchased in February and has stopped working this May. But, on the upside the device is so affordable.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this. The instruction manual is pretty hard to understand. And it never heated up. Only the infrared lights came on and the handle heated up some but that&#x27;s it. Had to send it back.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, the only think is that I am not sure if all the lights around should be on or just 3.  The  machine does not heat up and I have it at the highest point not sure if that is the way it should be.  I have only use it once so not sure if its working yet.  I will write another review in a month and see if it made a difference in the appearance of my legs.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all!!! Highly suggest that you not to waste your money like I did!!!! Smfh</li>
    <li> Fantastic, glad I bought it!!  the first time I bought this item, it did not work so I sent it back and ordered another, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  You have to be patient with it and keep doing it, you will see results.</li>
    <li> I thought it will be more powerful</li>
    <li> please this product made small circles in my face what I do i think it will spreed in my face .Amnah</li>
    <li> Terrible so disappointed...it doesn&#x27;t work! It turns on for a minute and then off!!!! At the time I tried to contact the company the item was showing as out of stock so I wasn&#x27;t able to return it or make any comments.....truly disappointing because I was really looking forward to using and seeing great results! And my went down the drain!!! And now that the option to return is back on the return option has expired!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</li>
    <li> Might be working. Really could use some instructions.</li>
    <li> I really gave it a good try even went out and bought the cream that I need for it , followed the instruction to the letter&lt;br /&gt;every day , it just dose not work . Sorry but I would not recommend save your money .</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product until I got it. I read the instruction manual, turned it on and was disappointed big time.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic white handle heated up instead of the metal part that was suppose to heat.&lt;br /&gt;I tried adjusting the settings but NOPE.&lt;br /&gt;I put it back in the package and shipped it back to Amazon the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;So grateful that I chose the Amazon Prime option at least because I got a FULL refund.</li>
    <li> Cant ask for me.. Love the product.. I should stuck some more to seel others  to my friends. I see difference every after treatment.</li>
    <li> I love it, it did what it said it could. How do I get more gel pads and where at??</li>
    <li> Can see results in a week</li>
    <li> My cellulite is still here. Does that say enough? First off, the instructions are kind of unclear. I looked online and watched a video of how it works and then finally understood. Next, after using it for a while, I saw no difference. I actually only used it on one leg for cellulite to see if I saw a difference and nope, nothing. The silver part doesn&#x27;t get hot or vibrate. The lights get warm...but that&#x27;s because its a light. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money. I&#x27;m sending it back. Thank God I got it with prime or else I would have been out of 50 bucks.</li>
    <li> Results in just one use!&lt;br /&gt;Keep with it, don&#x27;t slack...slow movements and some pressure is key.</li>
    <li> To Complicated to use for an ordinary people  like me and my wife.  We thought it would be  easier to understand  but  it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> It is a realy good item the only problem with my it&#x27;s that the lights around it only 1 that goes on the other 3 does not turn  on.</li>
    <li> It function perfect but the manual its soo confuse, y suguest links of videos. The led fucnction its only 4 leds.</li>
    <li> I have not yet used the machine. The translation from Chinese to English is very poor. There is not a listing of ingredients of the spray. Not happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work. I had to send it back</li>
    <li> Great Results!!! This really works. I bought it to address the loose skin on my arms. In just a week my arm looks much better. I even use this on my face. I have other face-lifting/treatment machines. They all work. However, I found that this massage machine has great results. It has even helped to lift and tighten the skin under my eye.  It has also worked well to tighten loose skin on my neck..&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference. Just good for heating skin a bit. I thought I was going to feel kind of e-tingling shots to stimulate and the only I feel is heat and small vibration. Has No differences in calibration in any treatment  selection</li>
    <li> i think one would have to use this for at least 6 months to give a review of how it works for wrinkles or anything else ..I gave it a 3 star hoping to increase it to a 5 after i see if it works..Hope i remember to update in 6 months</li>
    <li> I returned it because I was scared of it. Normally when you have something like this you want a conductor, like a gel.so that you do not burn your skin. So i returned it because I did not have a conductor.</li>
    <li> Works very well on the face for firming.</li>
    <li> Description says one thing and manual says something different&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this item. The results are seen instantly on arms but on the abdominal area you have to use more frequently. Overall I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This machine has no vibration what so ever and very little heat...I am not at all sure what it is suppose to be doing Also the instruction do very little to explain anything.</li>
    <li> Small and great powerfull combination, good results.</li>
