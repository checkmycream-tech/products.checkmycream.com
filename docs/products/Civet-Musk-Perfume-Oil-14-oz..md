### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very Happy Buyer.</li>
      <li>It is WONDERFUL!!!</li>
      <li>This is a very good duplication of Coty Musk oil which is no longer sold.</li>
      <li>and I loved it!  </li>
      <li>Great INexpensive Christmas or birthday gift.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant aroma ....</li>
      <li>I will use this, but also will continue to try to find the civet that I loved years ago.</li>
      <li>but it must have been good.</li>
      <li>My sister used Civet oil years ago, and she loved it...</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I love this oil!  </li>
      <li>but it was pleasant for all occasions conservative and appealing.</li>
      <li>Very easy to wear.</li>
      <li>This has that great musk smell I was expecting, was reasonably priced, has held up fantastically in my perfumed oil mixtures (bought it a year ago - still is holding scent well) and I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>Amazon is the greatest web site to find things that you really need or want, and the prices are fantastic.    </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;is worn, and the warmer the person, the better it gets.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Sincerely,  Karen S.</li>
      <li>I was also looking for a softer civet that I use to buy many years ago that was made by Houbigant, but this is not quite it.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t have a good nose but did smell the oil right after I put it on.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty good when compared to it.  </li>
      <li>&amp; you will enjoy it just fine!</li>
      <li>Scent is soft and attractive.  </li>
      <li>Probably the best smelling oil other than the \\&quot;other\\&quot; product everyone knows about!</li>
      <li>I still have the empty bottle and it still smells, very good, I might add.  </li>
      <li>of the substitutes I suggested are available here on Amazon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been accused of being heartless and engaging in sacrilege before</li>
      <li>When my neighbor hugged me the other day she said that I smelled so clean &amp; that is a good thing!  </li>
      <li>is a slightly clean fragrance that will get you noticed.  </li>
      <li>Also smells clean.  </li>
      <li>Musk is one of my favorites, but this musk is more for a more mature woman.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a soft, warm musk but not the cloying powdery teenaged version of soft and warm.</li>
      <li>am still on the hunt for a true Civet Oil as I remember how its made me feel during that time in my life!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I love this smell so much I bought one for my Sister.</li>
      <li>He is still stuck on the scent \\&quot;Sweet</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice but has a masculine undertone.</li>
      <li>It is intimately bold.</li>
      <li>Now she&#x27;s got a new favorite too.</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>This is a very alluring smell when worn!  </li>
      <li>Dissatisfied, I expected it to b very soft ,i&#x27;ve purchased many musk and egyptian musk and loved them, this one was not the scent that i expected, can it be returned?</li>
      <li>This oil has a very musty smell.  </li>
      <li>I really like using it this way.  </li>
      <li>While this is definitely not the \\&quot;Civet Oil\\&quot; that I used in the &#x27;70&#x27;s, I do like the soft, clean scent that it does have.  </li>
      <li>I had a very old bottle of civit oil at home from the 70&#x27;s....  </li>
      <li>This hovers somewhere between clean soap and sweat earned as a result of some unexpected and slightly scandalous liaison.</li>
      <li>but it is no where near a civet aroma.</li>
      <li>Soft and cuddly.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too old.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me at times of Flex Shampoo, Jean Nate and Coty Wild Musk.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too young.  </li>
      <li>Not what I expected----smells like old perfume.</li>
      <li>More expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean better.</li>
      <li>It came in a small green bottle with a cork top</li>

    <li> Years ago, before it became illegal, I had a small vial of true musk.  I still have the empty bottle and it still smells, very good, I might add.  This stuff is pretty good when compared to it.  To me it is an acceptable substitute.  I like it.  Probably the best smelling oil other than the \\&quot;other\\&quot; product everyone knows about!</li>
    <li> Musk is one of my favorites, but this musk is more for a more mature woman.  I wound up giving it to my mother and she loves it. Great INexpensive Christmas or birthday gift.</li>
    <li> I never smelled it before and certainly not under this name but it was pleasant for all occasions conservative and appealing.</li>
    <li> I used to buy at Christmas time a Civet Musk that was sold at Montgomery Wards. That store has been closed now for a very long time, and I could not find anything close to it until I found it on the Amazon Web site.    The Civet Musk I received is from Body Time and it smells just the same as the one I purchased about 30 or so years ago.    Amazon is the greatest web site to find things that you really need or want, and the prices are fantastic.    Thank you Amazon for hooking me up through Body Time.    Sincerely,  Karen S.</li>
    <li> This oil has a very musty smell.  Not enough perfume in my opinion. It smells like musty underarms at times. Not pleased. It &#x27;s missing something. I thought it would smell similar to skin musk by Prince Matchebelli that I bought in Walmart , but last longer.  However, I was greatly disappointed. More expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean better.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  I poured it into a big bottle of unscented body lotion, and use it all over my body.  It is WONDERFUL!!!</li>
    <li> I just re-ordered the Body Time Civet in the 1/4 oz size and two of the 1/3 oz roll on.  The Civet is a ringer from the 1970s set of 5 cc bottles sold at Ward&#x27;s and Penny&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The set of 4 consisted of:&lt;br /&gt;5cc Civet by Alyssa Ashley - Houbigant  (Body Time will work )&lt;br /&gt;5cc Musk by Alyssa Ashley (Still available)&lt;br /&gt;5cc Patchouli by Houbigant (Try Spiritual Sky or Auric Blends)&lt;br /&gt;5cc Ambergris by Alyssa Ashley - Houbigant  (Try Madini)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the substitutes I suggested are available here on Amazon</li>
    <li> Want to return:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Dissatisfied, I expected it to b very soft ,i&#x27;ve purchased many musk and egyptian musk and loved them, this one was not the scent that i expected, can it be returned?</li>
    <li> This is a very alluring smell when worn!  I have gotten compliments from my sweetie every time I have worn it!  I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Was not like the civet I remember from the 70s .This scent was just the scent of plain musk oil.</li>
    <li> Again, this is not Civet - Not at all.</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant aroma .... but it is no where near a civet aroma. Sorry, I don&#x27;t recommend this product if you are looking for the &#x27;true&#x27; civet smell.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this musk, so decided to mix it with some unscented body lotion as I had read that another reviewer had done.  I really like using it this way.  However, I was looking for a civet that I used to use in the 70&#x27;s.  It came in a small green bottle with a cork top and I loved it!  This does not smell the same.  I will use this, but also will continue to try to find the civet that I loved years ago.</li>
    <li> I expected this to smell like civet oil sold in the 70&#x27;s.  It smelled like musk oil. I threw it away</li>
    <li> I admit I bought this to mix with essential oils in making homemade perfumery concoctions. I fully intended to adulterate it to my heart&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I dabbed a drop on my wrist...and now I&#x27;m feeling a little guilt at the adulterating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a soft, warm musk but not the cloying powdery teenaged version of soft and warm. This hovers somewhere between clean soap and sweat earned as a result of some unexpected and slightly scandalous liaison. It is not pretty. It is intimately bold. It is rightously assertive without being in your face. It lingers close to the body instead of venturing out to shock people. If someone smells this on you, they are close enough for a kiss. Take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still adulterate it into some perfume recipes. I&#x27;ve been accused of being heartless and engaging in sacrilege before and I suppose my little romance with civet musk will be no exception. The only difference between now and that impertinent little dab of scent is that I will reserve a bit of the musk as is, like the memory of that liaison, and strangers will no doubt wonder why I sit in a cafe with my elbows on the table, wrists within discrete sniffing distance and a nostalgic smile on my face.</li>
    <li> This has that great musk smell I was expecting, was reasonably priced, has held up fantastically in my perfumed oil mixtures (bought it a year ago - still is holding scent well) and I am very pleased. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected----smells like old perfume.</li>
    <li> I had a very old bottle of civit oil at home from the 70&#x27;s....  I was hoping this would be the same scent but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It was received in a timely manner. I used to wear Civet Musk in the 70s and this does not come close to the scent. Don&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
    <li> I love this smell so much I bought one for my Sister.Now she&#x27;s got a new favorite too.I&#x27;ll be buy a second bottle for myself just so I have a extra.Very Happy Buyer.</li>
    <li> While this is definitely not the \\&quot;Civet Oil\\&quot; that I used in the &#x27;70&#x27;s, I do like the soft, clean scent that it does have.  The oil itself does not have a long staying power so I have been adding it to either some Vanilla perfume or lotion so that it will last longer.  When my neighbor hugged me the other day she said that I smelled so clean &amp; that is a good thing!  As for my Hubby... He doesn&#x27;t have a good nose but did smell the oil right after I put it on.  Now he didn&#x27;t have the reaction that I was hoping for, but I am wearing it just for me anyways.  He is still stuck on the scent \\&quot;Sweet Honesty\\&quot; from Avon from the 70&#x27;s also but that now gives me a headache!!&lt;br /&gt;I am still on the hunt for a true Civet Oil as I remember how its made me feel during that time in my life!&lt;br /&gt;This is a slightly clean fragrance that will get you noticed.  Just don&#x27;t expect it to be the same as the product in the 70&#x27;s &amp; you will enjoy it just fine!</li>
    <li> Just like I remembered.  Scent is soft and attractive.  Doesn&#x27;t smell animal or base to me at all.  Also smells clean.  I find myself sniffing my wrists often.  Doesn&#x27;t smell too young.  Doesn&#x27;t smell too old.  Just right.</li>
    <li> but it must have been good. This person loves the aroma of musk, the longer it&lt;br /&gt;is worn, and the warmer the person, the better it gets.</li>
    <li> I wear this all the time! Reminds me at times of Flex Shampoo, Jean Nate and Coty Wild Musk. Definitely a warmer mus with powdery and sandalwood notes. Very easy to wear. Soft and cuddly. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells like musk but it doesn&#x27;t last like musk....sorry</li>
    <li> My sister used Civet oil years ago, and she loved it...I got it for her this Christmas, and even tho it is NOT quite the same scent....she still loves it!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.  Just wish it could be sent to Mexico.</li>
    <li> This is a very good duplication of Coty Musk oil which is no longer sold.</li>
    <li> I was also looking for a softer civet that I use to buy many years ago that was made by Houbigant, but this is not quite it. It&#x27;s nice but has a masculine undertone. I&#x27;ll keep searching.</li>
