      <li>These are truly beautiful hair clips.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful clip.</li>
      <li>Beautiful clip.  </li>
      <li>Looks great in the hair.  </li>
      <li>Great price too.</li>
      <li>Great gift from my husband.</li>
      <li>Holds my hair great, doesn&#x27;t slip out.</li>
      <li>Great colors and good quality.</li>
      <li>They hold your hair good and do not fall out.</li>
      <li>Absolutely gorgeous.</li>
      <li>This is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful hair clips that I have ever seen.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It does look nice.</li>
      <li>Love it, sturdy, lots of compliments, want more!</li>
      <li>Love the colors and the size.</li>
      <li>I have gotten many complements on this.</li>
      <li>Perfect to pin back my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this clip.  </li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on it.</li>
      <li>Although I am able to use this product by modifying my hairstyle, because of it&#x27;s  size, this clip would be more appropriate for shorter hair.</li>
      <li>Lovely colors.  </li>
      <li>It is not a very large clip but that is probably best since by packing your hair in the clip, it is easier to support the weight of the clip.</li>
      <li>Beautiful and solid.</li>
      <li>It is beautiful and solid, but a stone fell out immediately.</li>
      <li>Clip holds well in fine hair.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, sturdy, seems dependable, Looks stylish.</li>
      <li>Like everyone says, stunning, will never fall apart, absolutely beautiful, but small.</li>
      <li>Cute - but doesn&#x27;t hold much hair, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out a style that I can use the clip for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fortunately it was right there in my bathroom</li>
      <li>The quality of the beads is good and they are set well; none are loose and it survived my 5 foot &amp;#34;drop test&amp;#34;, as I tend to knock things off of my bathroom counter often.</li>
      <li>These hair &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; or clips are just as beautiful (if not more so) than the photos.</li>
      <li>Mesmerizing.</li>
      <li>very pretty and looks nice it long hair as a bun.</li>
      <li>This one is also super pretty--a real winner!</li>
      <li>However, the pretty wins out</li>
      <li>This clip has a nice weight, sturdy but not too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It seems pretty sturdy, though.</li>
      <li>so I was able to retrieve it and glue it back in.</li>
      <li>Very pretty and decent quality.</li>
      <li>This clip is much prettier than the picture.</li>
      <li>But, I have too much hair, it won&#x27;t grab all of it.</li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>shipping was fast, and this company delivered what it promised.</li>
      <li>The weight causes it to slide out of my hair no matter how much I try to clip into it.</li>
      <li>It definitely looks pretty in my hair and the sparkle makes getting ready for work easier to just pull the hair up.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t wear for super long periods of time.  </li>
      <li>This is a beautiful clip, but it&#x27;s on the small side and came with some missing gem stones.</li>
      <li>It probably works fine for folks with normal to thick hair.</li>
      <li>Overall, I like it, but the price is pretty high for the small size and gemstone flaws.</li>
      <li>, I wish it was a little bit bigger, but it is so pretty that I manage and wear it anyway.</li>
      <li>so it probably won&#x27;t work in fine, thin hair.</li>

<li> so it probably won&#x27;t work in fine, thin hair.</li>
<li> I have long, thick, heavy hair, so it is hard to find good clips.</li>
<li> I have gotten complements on it every single time I have worn it.  </li>
<li> I Was skeptical about buying this clip because I was afraid it would be too heavy and fall out of my hair, but to my happy surprise it is actually a smaller size that holds the hair very tightly, so not only stays in place, but doesn&#x27;t get in the way when I drive or lay back on the pillows to watch tv on the couch.</li>
<li> I just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t open as wide as some of the plastic ones I have and is a little heavy</li>
<li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair</li>
<li> I just need to clip closer to the end of my hair, where it is a little thinner, to get it all in.</li>
<li> This clip is very well made and the stones sparkle like crazy.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
<li> They are made of a fairly heavy metal.  </li>
<li> It stays in your hair and does not feel heavy on your head.</li>
<li> It is a metal clip and is quite heavy</li>
<li> Not too heavy.  </li>
<li> However, it is a bit too small for my preferred hairstyle.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not sure it will hold all of it</li>
<li> Not too glitzy that it can&#x27;t be worn to work or casually, but can definitely dress up an outfit for evening.</li>
<li> The clip needs to be at least 4&amp;#34</li>
<li> My hair is baby-fine thin, however, and I have trouble getting them to stay in my hair.</li>
<li> /&gt;it is also very heavy on the head!</li>
<li> Makes a casual hairstyle a little fancier.</li>
<li> So for this, I am wary and think I may end up regluing all stones before I wear it out of the house.</li>

    <li> Beautiful clip.  Looks great in the hair.  It doesn&#x27;t open as wide as some of the plastic ones I have and is a little heavy so I can&#x27;t wear for super long periods of time.  It definitely looks pretty in my hair and the sparkle makes getting ready for work easier to just pull the hair up.  Makes a casual hairstyle a little fancier.</li>

    <li> very pretty and looks nice it long hair as a bun.</li>
    <li> This clip is much prettier than the picture. The variety of colors make it go with almost any color. It is a metal clip and is quite heavy so it probably won&#x27;t work in fine, thin hair. I have thick, coarse, curly hair so it is ideal for me. It is not a very large clip but that is probably best since by packing your hair in the clip, it is easier to support the weight of the clip.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the size.</li>
    <li> Great gift from my husband. Beautiful clip. Great colors and good quality. Holds my hair great, doesn&#x27;t slip out. I would agree though, I wish it was a little bit bigger, but it is so pretty that I manage and wear it anyway. I just need to clip closer to the end of my hair, where it is a little thinner, to get it all in. Laura</li>
    <li> Smaller than it looks and it&#x27;s heavy. It does look nice.</li>
    <li> Cute - but doesn&#x27;t hold much hair, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out a style that I can use the clip for.&lt;br /&gt;it is also very heavy on the head!</li>
    <li> Very pretty, sturdy, seems dependable, Looks stylish. I just wish it was a little bigger. I have a lot of hair and I&#x27;m not sure it will hold all of it</li>
    <li> Sooo pretty but a bit small if you have a lot of hair you want to put up.  However, the pretty wins out and I still use it.</li>
    <li> This hair claw clip is beautiful!  However, it is a bit too small for my preferred hairstyle.  I have medium-fine, waist-length hair that I braid and tuck up, securing with some type of clip.  Although I am able to use this product by modifying my hairstyle, because of it&#x27;s  size, this clip would be more appropriate for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and has already worn it.</li>
    <li> Great clips!  Beautiful and functional.  I have long, thick, heavy hair, so it is hard to find good clips.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and solid. Love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the weight of this hair claw fool you. It stays in your hair and does not feel heavy on your head. Absolutely gorgeous. Customers at work ask me where I got it, even the men ask me. Of course I tell everyone, &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;, Baby.</li>
    <li> These are truly beautiful hair clips.  I had to return them because they are too short in length to put my hair all up.  The clip needs to be at least 4&amp;#34; to do that on my hair.  Otherwise, as beautiful as the picture.</li>
    <li> beautiful clip. I have gotten many complements on this. I would recommend for anyone. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Love it, sturdy, lots of compliments, want more!</li>
    <li> These hair &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; or clips are just as beautiful (if not more so) than the photos. They are made of a fairly heavy metal.  It probably works fine for folks with normal to thick hair. My hair is baby-fine thin, however, and I have trouble getting them to stay in my hair. The weight causes it to slide out of my hair no matter how much I try to clip into it. It does seem to be a well-made product, though, and they are gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast, and this company delivered what it promised.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and decent quality. Clip holds well in fine hair. It&#x27;s just a tad smaller than I thought it would be. The quality of the beads is good and they are set well; none are loose and it survived my 5 foot &amp;#34;drop test&amp;#34;, as I tend to knock things off of my bathroom counter often. None of the beads fell off, which is a good sign! Not too glitzy that it can&#x27;t be worn to work or casually, but can definitely dress up an outfit for evening.</li>
    <li> These are the best clips. They hold your hair good and do not fall out. Give them a try.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful clip, but it&#x27;s on the small side and came with some missing gem stones. It seems pretty sturdy, though. Overall, I like it, but the price is pretty high for the small size and gemstone flaws.</li>
    <li> This is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful hair clips that I have ever seen.  I have gotten complements on it every single time I have worn it.  This clip is very well made and the stones sparkle like crazy.  Because of the multi-color crystals, I can wear this clip with almost any outfit.  This clip has a nice weight, sturdy but not too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect to pin back my hair.  Lovely colors.  Not too heavy.  Very well made.</li>
    <li> Like everyone says, stunning, will never fall apart, absolutely beautiful, but small. If it was twice as big I&#x27;d never take it off. Mesmerizing. But, I have too much hair, it won&#x27;t grab all of it. I am keeping it though.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful and solid, but a stone fell out immediately. Fortunately it was right there in my bathroom so I was able to retrieve it and glue it back in. So for this, I am wary and think I may end up regluing all stones before I wear it out of the house.</li>
