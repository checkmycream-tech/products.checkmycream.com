      <li>But I&#x27;ve been using one of these Microplane pedicure tools for years with excellent results, and will continue to prefer it over the Pedi-Rock : http://www.amazon.com/Microplane-Foot-Buffer-Orb-Natural/dp/B002Z63VBW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_19?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1399066633&amp;sr&#x3D;1-19&amp;keywords&#x3D;microplane+foot+file</li>
      <li>It took of skin that was peeling off my foot very good.</li>
      <li>Good product!</li>
      <li>The flexibility of the shape is great, because it conforms to the foot, so you can file where you need to.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>

      <li>If you have a man in your life with scratchy feet this might be a nice gift for him.</li>
      <li>and it was not as effective for me.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice feel to it and fits in my hand while giving curvy edges for getting in all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update the review when I feel like the product is no longer effective.</li>
      <li>I use Dreamside Body Balm afterwards on my feet and they are super smooth and flawless!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best thing I have found to do just that.</li>
      <li>But this is by far one of the best I like.</li>
      <li>This is ok, however I found a foot rasp to be more effective.</li>
      <li>pumice stone is more effective, but harsher on the foot and makes more of a</li>
      <li>It is ergonomically very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>This is way better than using a pumice stone or a sandpaper-type file for removing callouses.  </li>

      <li>I love to wear sandals during the summer</li>
      <li>I like to call okeefs healthy feet.</li>
      <li>This and the magic in a tub</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>but people who scrub their feet with pedi-rocks often may want to get a more durable product.</li>
      <li>My feet get so nice and smooth with this product .</li>
      <li>, make sure you rinse it off well after each use.</li>
      <li>Ordered this as requested by my lovely wife - and she reports it works well without problems.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And while I got this product, free of charge through the Amazon Vine Program, in exchange for an honest review, I purchased one this evening.  </li>
      <li>Love how it hugs the foot, covering more area at once.  </li>
      <li>Works Even better after a bath or soaking feet</li>
      <li>I need to buy two more, just in case they stop making them or....  </li>
      <li>Really terrific idea -- good size, easy to use and does a great job of smoothing the skin on my feet.</li>
      <li>Super pleased!</li>
      <li>It did a pretty good job of smoothing them out  </li>
      <li>One can get a grip on it, but perhaps not at the most comfortable angle for use.</li>
      <li>Because it conforms to each crack and crevice, it really does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>He loved it so much that he ordered another as gift for his sister.</li>
      <li>I have to say that this foot rock is now at the top of my success chart!  </li>
      <li>Something like this product - with no moving parts, or refills to buy, or colors to choose from - is an easy review.</li>
      <li>from my feet easily.  </li>
      <li>The shape allows it to conform to your hand to make it extremely easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to grip without my hand cramping up.</li>
      <li>The shape makes it easy to hold on to.</li>
      <li>so its easy to grip.</li>
      <li>The bomb..soft and easy to use on your feet.</li>
      <li>The shape of this file makes it easy to attend to curves on the foot.</li>
      <li>and it cleans up easily.</li>
      <li>This is the absolute easiest and most effective foot file I&#x27;ve ever  used.  </li>
      <li>Like my title says, I really liked the Pedi-rock a lot when I first received it, but after continued use it has its drawbacks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Plus it turns out the squeezability makes it perfect for manipulating into odd places.</li>
      <li>It rinses clean easily.</li>
      <li>Also rinses clean easily.  </li>
      <li>For the softer skin, such as the tops of my toes, I have some great exfoliating gloves that I use while I&#x27;m bathing.  </li>
      <li>I have used many ways and tools (e.g. pedi egg, many different kinds of pumice stone, files, razor kind, masks, chemicals...</li>
      <li>and my feet are really smooth after use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s curved and feels comfortable in my hand and on my feet.  </li>
      <li>It has made my heels smooth.</li>
      <li>There is no way to effectively clean, and that&#x27;s just a bit too funky for me.</li>
      <li>I was extremely surprised and pleased at how well it worked on his man feet!  </li>
      <li>My feet quickly shed their winter callouses and are smooth and healthy again and ready for spring.</li>
      <li>I love my tootsies and I try to keep them at the flip flop ready with routine maintenance.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty easy to use and hold.</li>
      <li>The exfoliating gloves coupled with this foot file makes my feet really smooth and young looking, better than you can imagine.  </li>
      <li>I think it should hold up for most normal uses though</li>
      <li>Pedi-Rock is gentler but it takes a good long time to make any progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite foot tool.</li>
      <li>It fast and easy to use.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This foot scrub works perfect and almost instantly!  Love it</li>
    <li> nice foot scrub. works better than the hard stone pumice for me. it&#x27;s like a hard sponge with a rough surface!</li>
    <li> This is the bomb....I found it at CVS the first time I purchased it and the next time I went back to replace it they were no longer carrying it.  Found it on amazon yay!  The bomb..soft and easy to use on your feet.</li>
    <li> Works great allows me to get to areas that I otherwise would not be able to. Works Even better after a bath or soaking feet</li>
    <li> Brilliant product!!..... So difficult to find them, except on Amazon. I purchased two at the same time. They are flexible, work great wet or dry and are better than any other callus, rough skin product on the market. I am a senior citizen and they do not hurt my feet or are too rough. I need to buy two more, just in case they stop making them or....  I can&#x27;t find them.</li>
    <li> This is ok, however I found a foot rasp to be more effective. When I ordered this I thought it was a pumice stone but it is actually just a sponge coated with an emery-board type coating</li>
    <li> I run a lot so I have some pretty gnarly callouses on my toes.  It did a pretty good job of smoothing them out  I thought it might be a bit abrasive but it really wasn&#x27;t.  Or maybe my callouses are just so thick I couldn&#x27;t feel the difference.  It took a little bit more scrubbing than I expected, but it did the job well.</li>
    <li> This is way better than using a pumice stone or a sandpaper-type file for removing callouses.  The flexibility of the shape is great, because it conforms to the foot, so you can file where you need to.  It&#x27;s flexible enough to conform, and still stiff enough to give good backing to the abrasives.  Good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this file for several weeks now, first dry as a kind of sandpaper to really make a dent in the thick cracked calluses on my heels, and then in the bathtub after I&#x27;ve soaked my feet a while. The file works wonderfully both wet and dry, and it is amply sized so my arthritic hands can hold it easily. I like the narrower end because you can run it between your toes if you need to. If your feet are in as bad of a shape as mine are, it may take you a while to get them down totally smooth, but with regular use and some foot cream along the way, I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this file, I tried it on my arms because my skin has been very dry and I&#x27;ve built up some whitehead-like bumps that I hoped to buff off. I would not advise doing this, because this file is strong enough to leave ugly red scratches on softer skin. (Think coarse sandpaper.) But for feet and, with a little more gentle treatment, elbows, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that the gritty-feeling surface would rub off after a few uses, but so far this has not been the case. It&#x27;s holding up really well, and I like this file a lot.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the &#x27;soft&#x27; concept as opposed to traditional pumice stones.. Actually seems more &#x27;stone-like&#x27; then pumice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removed my dried flaky skin on the palm of my hand easily... I found that less pressure worked better.</li>
    <li> It worked best on my foot when both the Pedi-Rock and my foot were dry, however, on the harder to reach spots, like near my toes, I found that it works best wet, I used a shower chair to sit on for safety. I think this is a really nice product, better than the really hard pumice stones that I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion, make sure you rinse it off well after each use.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as requested by my lovely wife - and she reports it works well without problems. Although it looks like a rock it is a soft sponge with sandpaper like surface which works well to remove callouses. Looks like it might work well for some general light sanding around the wood shop as well, but I have not tried it out for that!</li>
    <li> The main thing I like about this foot file is the shape. It&#x27;s easy to grip without my hand cramping up. It&#x27;s very ergonomic and it really does the job. I use it for a few seconds every day on each foot in the shower. My feet quickly shed their winter callouses and are smooth and healthy again and ready for spring. It doesn&#x27;t absorb water, which is good because it shouldn&#x27;t grow any kind of fungus in the shower. It rinses clean easily. I like it and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> In choosing one word for this Pedi-Rock foot file, I must choose &amp;#34;gentle.&amp;#34; Ordinarily, this word has a positive connotation; but for me, and my toughly callused feet, it simply means that the tool is inadequate. The Pedi-Rock foot file is exactly as described. It is large, somewhat soft, and slightly abrasive. The size of the rock might be a problem for people with small hands, as it is rather large and can be a bit awkward to hold despite its flexibility. One can get a grip on it, but perhaps not at the most comfortable angle for use. The abrasiveness is rather low, making the Pedi-Rock useful for less dry, less callused areas of the feet such as the sides and tips of the toes. But for heavy-duty dead skin removal, this device just doesn&#x27;t do a thing. If a person doesn&#x27;t need heavy skin removal, this would be an acceptable tool for keeping the feet generally smooth. But I&#x27;ve been using one of these Microplane pedicure tools for years with excellent results, and will continue to prefer it over the Pedi-Rock : http://www.amazon.com/Microplane-Foot-Buffer-Orb-Natural/dp/B002Z63VBW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_19?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1399066633&amp;sr&#x3D;1-19&amp;keywords&#x3D;microplane+foot+file</li>
    <li> Used regularly, this soft foot file works nicely to soften callused areas of your feet. The stone-like file is soft and easily gripped, then form fits itself to the area being filed so as to get into those otherwise difficult to reach areas on the pads of your toes. It seems to retain its sharpness over time but isn&#x27;t so sharp as to be irritating or to leave feet feeling scratched.</li>
    <li> I had no idea what this Pedi-Rock would feel like, other than rock-like, which, surprisingly, it was not. Instead it was like a sponge covered in sandpaper, which was a lot less daunting to rub on one&#x27;s foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used wet or dry and I&#x27;ve found I prefer to use it wet - usually while I bathe. Results are quickly achieved, though repeated use is obviously best.</li>
    <li> This is pretty easy to use and hold. It can be used as wet or dry--I prefered wet, to avoid any irritations as I have sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t try to over scrub, and thus I had a gentle experience. My skin was indeed smoother and softer afterwards.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It molds to your foot and works better at taking off the rough skin than anything we have ever tried. Also rinses clean easily.  After borrowing mine, my mom bought one for herself, her sister, and my daughter.  Now the whole family is using it!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute easiest and most effective foot file I&#x27;ve ever  used.  I love it.  It sloff&#x27;s off the disgusting stuff (dead skin, calluses, etc.) from my feet easily.  Because it conforms to each crack and crevice, it really does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that it&#x27;s quite easy to grip because the entire surface is the filing surface so you get a good grip on the product while scrubbing at your feet.  I let this air dry outside of the shower stall because I fear it may grow mold.  However, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything funky as of yet by keeping it on the bathroom shelf.</li>
    <li> It work well on wet soaked feet. Geometry of it is a bit awkward for me - too big and not exactly ergonomic. It leaves residue in form of small black specks on your skin and tub, which you have to wash off.</li>
    <li> The product worked well at removing some dry skin from my feet and it appears to be holding up pretty well. I was worried when I saw some black pieces around where I had scrubbed come off but I read from other review it&#x27;s a normal occurrence and not an indication there&#x27;s something faulty with my pedi-rock itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I worry about is how long this thing is going to last if pieces are already coming off. I don&#x27;t use it very often though so I think it&#x27;d last as long as it was worth it but people who scrub their feet with pedi-rocks often may want to get a more durable product. I think it should hold up for most normal uses though and perhaps I&#x27;m just being conservative.</li>
    <li> After this past winter I started noticing that my feet were cracking a bit on the heels and the sides of my feet.  I also had a few spots that looked like the start of a corn. I love to wear sandals during the summer so I needed to get my feet into shape.  So I started using this foot file along with a good lotion and my feet look so much better after only a few uses.  This really helped to get rid of the dry dead skin and espose the new skin so Ii could pamper my feet.</li>
    <li> This product is basically a sponge covered with emery/sand paper.  It is ergonomically very comfortable.  I wanted the Proffot Pedi-Rock to even up my skin after using a foot file. It worked quite well for that.  However, I did also try using it on its own to file away the dead skin, and it takes a lot of work to make any progress on the dead skin.  I will use it to even out my skin from the foot file, but I will not use it again to try to eliminate the dead skin on its own.</li>
    <li> Like my title says, I really liked the Pedi-rock a lot when I first received it, but after continued use it has its drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rock works great for your feet, and is less rough than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  It fits in your hand well, and naturally fits the curves of your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pedi-rock is a firm foam, and the packaging days can be used wet or dry.  I keep mine the shower and though I keep it on a track to dry, there is no way to really tell if it is our not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no easy way to to clean it. That is my biggest beef with it.... There is no way to effectively clean, and that&#x27;s just a bit too funky for me.</li>
    <li> This is a  very nice product. I have very rough hard feet. I generally use a foot file to work on them. The pro foot rock is a very different type of foot file. It&#x27;s the size of a fat pear and quite firm.  The package states that it works in  a minute... not really. I use it dry for 5 to 10 minutes. My feet get so nice and smooth with this product . I only find it a little difficult to get in the area behind my toes. I tried it wet and it was not as effective for me.  It does produce lots of skin/dust so perhaps put a towel down before using. After use you just need to rinse it with water. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it does not show any wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note my boyfriend saw this product and was immediately interested in having one for his feet. So I ordered one for him... He loved it so much that he ordered another as gift for his sister. If you have a man in your life with scratchy feet this might be a nice gift for him. It&#x27;s not too girly and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prices on AMAZON fluctuate  daily , I paid 5.99 when I ordeded the rock for my boyfriend. I see today that it&#x27;s selling for much higher perhaps wait and see it the price drops again.</li>
    <li> Really terrific idea -- good size, easy to use and does a great job of smoothing the skin on my feet. Less abrasive than a traditional pumice stone and it cleans up easily.</li>
    <li> This is great!  It scrapes dead skin right off, but is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt and doesn&#x27;t leave irritation behind when you really go at it.  On a large callus, it takes a while but will still get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it&#x27;s flexible too...will conform to wherever on your foot you need it to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash - just used dishsoap and water.  Seemed to do the trick very well...no funkiness left behind.</li>
    <li> Much easier to hold and maneuver than a pumice stone. Love how it hugs the foot, covering more area at once.  Have used it about ten times now and no black residue in site. Only thing I would change is to make it even bigger.</li>
    <li> This file does an okay job of gently buffing your feet, but won&#x27;t do much for major calluses. I can&#x27;t recommend it, because the silicon carbide crystals that do the buffing come off as a fine, blackish shiny powder and make a mess if you use the rock dry rather than in the shower. Unless you want to grab your Dustbuster and clean up after every use, you&#x27;re better off with a different foot file.</li>
    <li> I just got one of these and I love it! It&#x27;s firm but still has enough give to work on all areas of the foot. This is my new favorite foot tool.</li>
    <li> This product is not what you would call a &amp;#34;rock.&amp;#34;  I was expecting something hard and akin to a pumice stone. Instead, it is soft and spongy with a rough exterior.  That being said, it does seem to be slowly helping slough off the callouses on my feet.  If you want instant removal however, you want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> In the cooler months I get extremely dry feet and sometimes calluses. Once I get a callus it is normally hard to get rid of. I have used several blocks or files in the past to get rid of calluses, but they are often difficult to use and sometimes painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pedi-Rock is great. The shape allows it to conform to your hand to make it extremely easy to use. The Pedi-Rock is made of a softer material with a rougher surface to file off the calluses. The Pedi-Rock has a large surface area, so it is going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pedi-Rock removed my calluses relatively quickly and easily with little pain. My hand did feel a tiny bit sore after using it since the whole rock is covered in the silicon carbide crystal surface. The soreness faded after a few minutes. This could be avoided by wearing gloves or holding the Pedi-Rock with a cloth. You can also use this Pedi-Rock wet or dry which is neat. I have mostly been using it dry since I like to use it while watching television on my couch. I also like to be able to see the callus that I am working on which is harder when wet. If you find it painful to use dry (which you really shouldn&#x27;t), it is a little gentler if you use it wet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used pumice stones before to work on calluses, but never one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stone is more effective, but harsher on the foot and makes more of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pedi-Rock is gentler but it takes a good long time to make any progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a nice feel in your hand.</li>
    <li> These flexible abrasive stones work well when used wet to remove callus build up on the heels, and big toe.  It rinses clean and can be air dried.  Over time it looses its abrasive particles, especially if you overdo the pressure used when scrubbing.  Don&#x27;t squeeze it out to dry it or it will break down faster.</li>
    <li> This is a sponge with grit covering.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  Sent it back.</li>
    <li> The best I ever tried. No need to do callus remover in a studio. Just do this every 1-2 weeks when showering!</li>
    <li> This product does a fantastic job of exfoliating the old skin off your feet (and elbows ect).  It fast and easy to use.  Because it is soft it moulds easily to the shape of your foot allowing for you to work on a larger area at once, while preventing you from going too deep.  I only use it dry because my calluses become too soft when wet.  After each use I just rinse the pedi-rock off with water, and it is like new once it dries.  It is such a great product I bought one for all my siblings and parents!  The worst review I found on this product before purchasing stated that it was &amp;#34;not a rock, do not purchase!&amp;#34;  If you want a real rock shop elsewhere, if you want to quickly and easily remove dry old skin then this pedi-rock is the best product you can buy!</li>
    <li> So, for $8 (what I paid) it seems worth the money. It has held up well and does help smooth and file, but don&#x27;t expect this to slough off thick calluses in one use. I usually wait until the end of my shower, so my soles are softer, and give a nice buff around the edges It took me about a week of doing this once daily to get the years of calluses off my heels, and I am since quite pleased with how it works as a maintenance tool. Note that the &#x27;flexibility&#x27; seems to come from some sort of foam core and the &#x27;rough&#x27; file material does seem to shed and wear a little. I anticipate replacing this in about 2 months, still a decent buy.</li>
    <li> First off let me say I did not buy this product on Amazon. But I would like to say it has helped me tremendously with smoothing out my rough heels.  This is by far the best thing I have found to do just that. This and the magic in a tub I like to call okeefs healthy feet. These two products will have you feet back to radiant health in no time flat.</li>
    <li> I have used many ways and tools (e.g. pedi egg, many different kinds of pumice stone, files, razor kind, masks, chemicals...etc) to try to eliminate my callus under the ball of my feet. Most things either works great for a short period of time or just difficult to use. But this is by far one of the best I like. I used it during shower and with a little effort, it keeps my callus under control. Highly recommend if you usually use pumice stone, this is like an upgrade version. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works great but gentle. If you leave it in your shower, beware, the water will filter through and leave black streaks that I haven&#x27;t fully gotten off yet.</li>
    <li> Does the job well without tearing your feet up. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It worked on the dry skin area on both feet. It exfoliated without being too harsh.  I&#x27;d recommend int.</li>
    <li> Amazing. This foot file is truly the best one available. I have tried pumice, pedi-egg, file boards even the razor with minimal effect. Pedicure treatments did nothing to eliminate the years of accumulation of dry, hard laters of my 60 something tootsies. My first use of the Pedi-rock REMOVED the rough surface and even the hard developed callus on the ball of my foot and the side of my toes. I will sing its praise for years to come. I may not be able to do anything about the wrinkles I am gathering and the grey hair I am sporting BUT I will have much nicer looking feet. Yup - I am thrilled!</li>
    <li> I love my tootsies and I try to keep them at the flip flop ready with routine maintenance.  I don’t get crazy calloused, but after walking around all summer in my bare feet or flip flops, I generally need a couple of good scrubs to get them looking and feeling smooth again.  The same goes after the long winter season - it usually takes a little more than routine maintenance to get me ready to go bare again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried pretty much every cream, scrub, and foot file known to man with various degrees of success and failure over the years.  I have to say that this foot rock is now at the top of my success chart!  I have tried it on both wet and dry feet.  While it works on both, I find it works better after my feet have soaked whilst in the shower, first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I got this product, free of charge through the Amazon Vine Program, in exchange for an honest review, I purchased one this evening.  I liked it that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now while my feet are pretty well cared for, I tried this rock on my husband’s feet last night – those feet could stand a little more TLC on a more regular basis.  I was extremely surprised and pleased at how well it worked on his man feet!  It by no means took all the callous away in one sitting, but it made a nice start and left his feet very smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have found to complain about is that it seems a little hard on my fingers when I am using it – especially m finger tips.  But that isn’t doing to stop me.  I am loving this little squishy rock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherise Everhard, April 2014</li>
    <li> I hate wearing shoes and my feet pay for it. Whether it&#x27;s winter or summer, I have rough heels and ugly callouses. I try and use those metal graters in shower, the ones with the plastic handle and the pumice on one side, grater on the other, and they work to some extent but they don&#x27;t conform to the shape of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I opened this package, I was expecting a hard piece with a rough surface. But actually, it is a formed soft foam with a sandpaper-like finish. I was disappointed thinking that it was never going to have enough strength to lesson the hard edges of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But within minutes, I had a nasty pile of dust and a smooth heel. It was easy and effective to use and quickly got through a tough edge on my heel. It has a nice feel to it and fits in my hand while giving curvy edges for getting in all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the time of year for sandals and flip-flops. No one wants to see my ugly, cracked heels. So I am thrilled that this has already made a big difference on my feet and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be warned, once your feet are &#x27;buffed&#x27;, you may just go sliding across the floor!</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to a tee &amp; no matter what I do it WILL NOT remove the dry skin on my feet.</li>
    <li> The shape of this file makes it easy to attend to curves on the foot. I expected it to be rock-like, but it&#x27;s softer and almost squishy. I would say it did as good a job, if not better, than my expensive foot files. I just wonder how long it will hold up, since it&#x27;s basically like sandpaper wrapped around the &amp;#34;rock.&amp;#34; However, for the price point, it&#x27;s worth the purchase to get you through sandal season (and possibly longer!) I&#x27;ll update the review when I feel like the product is no longer effective.</li>
    <li> Something like this product - with no moving parts, or refills to buy, or colors to choose from - is an easy review. The shape makes it easy to hold on to. And it works! That&#x27;s all you need to say, I guess.</li>
    <li> I love this Profoot Pedi-Rock because it actually works.  It&#x27;s curved and feels comfortable in my hand and on my feet.  I love that you can use it wet or dry and my feet are really smooth after use.  I&#x27;m getting all of my family members one of these for Christmas!</li>
    <li> My husband has horrible calluses on his feet.&lt;br /&gt;After months I finally talked him into getting a pedicure -- now something he does on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He uses this nightly before bed to help tame the calluses in-between pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This by itself will not take away thick calluses -- however for smaller calluses or for maintenance it is a great option.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used. The shape and texture lets you get your calluses all smoothed out. I will use this forever! You need one!</li>
    <li> Works extremely well on the callus on the side of my big toe, but for the sensitive skin on the tops of my feet I felt it was a bit too harsh.  For the softer skin, such as the tops of my toes, I have some great exfoliating gloves that I use while I&#x27;m bathing.  I use this Pedi-Rock on the bottom and sides where the skin is not so sensitive.  The exfoliating gloves coupled with this foot file makes my feet really smooth and young looking, better than you can imagine.  I&#x27;m over 50 but at least my feet look young now.  :-)</li>
    <li> Haha am I the first non vine review ? Anyway this rock is the ssss.. Stuff. I usually use mr pumice and I have to really work at getting my feet soft when I go weeks with out taking care of them. This rock seriously cut my time in half and left my feet so soft . It&#x27;s rough enough to handle tough spots yet gentle enough to scrub the top of your feet and ankles if you&#x27;re gentle . I really really love this rock. I haven&#x27;t had any black pieces come off like the 2 star reviews mentioned . I&#x27;ve used it in the shower so not dry. But definitely buy this if you&#x27;re thinking about it .</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievable. I recommend these to everyone, we all need foot care. I am a Nail Tech and I think this is the best tool yet to get the calluses off your feet. This is shaped to fit perfectly in the palm of your hand and it has some give to it so its easy to grip. You can use it dry or wet, it has to grit types on it, and its easy to clean!! Highly recommended to those who find it hard to reach your feet, if you can cross your legs at the knee you can use this with ease.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a totally unusual foot file. I thought I was getting some hard substance like petrified lava and instead it turned out to be....squeezable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you&#x27;d think something spongy wouldn&#x27;t have enough oomph to remove two months of hideously shaggy calluses, but this item rivaled my husband&#x27;s industrial emery file. I used the Profoot right after a bath (as recommended) and needed just 20 minutes to regain presentable feet . LIke other friction-based files, this one heats up, so be careful. But it&#x27;s leagues ahead of those cheese-grater models and way easier to gauge so you don&#x27;t over-use. Plus it turns out the squeezability makes it perfect for manipulating into odd places. This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Along with your dead skin and the sloughed-off carcasses of dust mites, be prepared to vacuum up bits of black grit shed by the file itself.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works great! It took of skin that was peeling off my foot very good. It&#x27;s not tough on the foot. You can also use this wet/dry which is pretty awesome! It&#x27;s not hard either. You have total control of the pedi-rock and literally use it at any angle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product because it&#x27;s different than all the other callus foot files I&#x27;ve tried. I use Dreamside Body Balm afterwards on my feet and they are super smooth and flawless!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local store. I have used it for awhile now. It has made my heels smooth. I have always felt pumice stones were tearing at my heels. This is awesome.  Use it wet or dry. I follow with a foot moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love it! It fixed my feet in one try! Definitely the best and cheapest</li>
    <li> So Awesome!!! I&#x27;m never buying a flat callus remover again! I was concerned it would be rough on my hand like a pumice stone, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Super pleased!</li>
    <li> just what hubby and I needed, not to rough and not too soft,just right for filing those callouses!!</li>
    <li> I am not one who spends a lot of time trying to perfect my feet so I am not a connoisseur of the pedicure tools available, but it did occur to me that my feet were pretty rough so I picked this up. I use this on my feet after they are soft from the shower. This rubs away my calluses with little effort and makes my feet very soft. It&#x27;s like a big eraser for calluses.</li>
