      <li>But ever since I was a teenager this has been the best product for my acne.</li>
      <li>The best thing to do is go see a dermatologist!</li>
      <li>It took me 2 month to make my skin look flawless, really flawless!</li>
      <li>However, it worked wonderfully for my son, who is 14 and has a bit of acne.</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff for hormonal acne!</li>
      <li>If not the spray is perfect because you can use it on any angle.</li>

      <li>Either way, this is a brand with great products.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>i wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had a great complexion</li>
      <li>I am really happy to have tried this product.</li>
      <li>I tried Pro-activ with great hope, but the product didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for acne for about 7 years, it is great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the result.</li>
      <li>This is great product, I have been buying n buying it over again, suggested to my friend.</li>

      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This product is great it helps with my cystic acne.</li>

      <li>So glad it&#x27;s here on Amazon and at a great price too!</li>
      <li>And with the cost of Nature&#x27;s Cure, I can&#x27;t think of anything more perfect than effectiveness combined with value.  </li>
      <li>Works great, Feels Good On Skin.</li>
      <li>It does have strong drying powers, but it does it&#x27;s job wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why you can&#x27;t easily get this at drugstores anymore, because it is the greatest thing for clearing acne!</li>
      <li>hopefully I won&#x27;t need to purchase again, but if you do continuously have skin problems, this is always a good product to turn to.</li>
      <li>I feel like a month is a fair amount of time to see some change.  </li>
      <li>Good morning.</li>
      <li>and then I will just use the sprays since they got good reviews like the cream.</li>
      <li>Yep, it didn&#x27;t look good at all.</li>
      <li>had to experiment, but a good face scrub helps the skin shed quicker</li>
      <li>The cream is really good too.</li>
      <li>I think I gave this product a fair chance.</li>
      <li>Good Luck.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Natures Cure.</li>
      <li>Good luck to all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, after you spot apply the cream, give it a good 10-20 minutes to soak in.</li>
      <li>And she loved it too</li>
      <li>had to experiment, but a good face scrub helps the skin shed quicker</li>
      <li>It is the best BP I&#x27;ve used and cleared me up quickly.</li>
      <li>I am very glad it works for others though</li>
      <li>However, I am very pleased to see my face now that I have almost no acne at all.</li>
      <li>Happy to find it is available on Amazon!</li>
      <li>I have not had a break out since and I am very pleased about that.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find it because i used so many products , treatments, etc and nothing worked.</li>
      <li>I will update as time goes on, but right now, this senior citizen is one happy camper!</li>

      <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seeing progressive changes in my teens pimple battles</li>
    <li> worked ok. cleared up some acne but not all of it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, it works well for the skin.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for my daughters skin, tried everything and added natural supplements like this one. Nothing worked. had to go to a dermatologist for much more effective treatments. may not be for very stubborn acne which she has had.</li>
    <li> It works after 4 weeks see results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help my ache whatsoever..</li>
    <li> I saw no difference and felt I wasted money on this</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no reservations in recommending this product very highly! I&#x27;m not sure what makes it work, but it&#x27;s the only product that consistently eliminates my acne and prevents breakouts without causing irritation or dry/flaky skin. I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products, and Nature&#x27;s Cure is the one I now rely on. I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s not available in many stores, but I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m down to the last week&#x27;s worth of pills and they aren&#x27;t bad. My face hasn&#x27;t cleared up entirely, but it seems like it hasn&#x27;t gotten much worse since I&#x27;ve been using the system either. I think because of the fact that I haven&#x27;t seen any new acne on my face since using it, I will probably reorder. However, I am not all that hopeful that it can clear everything up completely.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for 4 of my children, male and female treatments. It requires some patience but it worked better for 2 of my children and as well for the others as prescription meds which had various side effects. My kids felt that the prescriptions would work better (peer issue). They all ended up liking Nature&#x27;s Cure better due to lack of side effects and results. Yes they have to remember to use it daily but that does not differ from almost any other type of treatment, washes, meds, creams etc.</li>
    <li> made my skin really red and itchy. I think I am allergic to this pill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I came across this item! Not only is it priced well, but I saw a real improvement within a few days.  I had fewer breakouts just by taking the pills, and if one did pop up, the cream took care of it!  I would reccomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> i used this when i was in high school when my skin was pretty terrible for a while. after using it for a few months, my skin was the best it had ever been. stopped using it for a while, went to a dermatologist when my skin got bad again, and the results were just so-so. it got too expensive, so i started trying non-prescription products and systems that have infomercials and are supposed to work incredibly well. i wasn&#x27;t happy with the results. i decided to go back to nature&#x27;s cure last month and see if it would give me results again. i&#x27;ve been using it for a month, and already i notice a difference. i like the homeopathic route because the side effects are slim to none: no interactions with other medicines, no extra skin sensitivity. the spot treatment, although it contains benzoyl peroxide, does not dry my skin out around the spots, but decreases their size. it&#x27;s gentle enough that i can apply it several times a day, and my skin still doesn&#x27;t dry out. there are 2 things i dislike about this product: 1) you can&#x27;t buy the spot treatment and tablets separate. i haven&#x27;t even gone through half the tube, and now i have a whole other one. 2) i can&#x27;t find it in any stores near me! but amazon has good prices, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, but a lot of products did not for me. May be good for someone with mild acne. I would say try this product and write a review back to me if its works. I truely think this is a good product for someone else, just not me. Have heard great reviews about it on the Hairlista Inc website.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for acne for about 7 years, it is great. It makes all my acne go away and it is completely inexpensive. The only bad thing is that it bleaches some of my clothes and pillow cases so I only wear it when I&#x27;m at home and have something white on or something that I don&#x27;t mind if it gets stained. But overall it works great!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is the only thing besides Accutane that has cleared my Adult Acne. I will continue to use this  product as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> So I have to share my experience with another product in order to explain my experience with Nature&#x27;s Cure: I&#x27;ve struggled with mild acne since I was a teen, I used Proactiv for 10 yrs and it helped control it, but I recently quit it because I wanted to try something else, something that would even prevent the 2-3 HUGE cystic pimples I&#x27;d get (one on top of the other one for some reason) mostly once a month during &amp;#34;those days&amp;#34;. Posting on the Proactiv facebook page, an &amp;#34;Unblemish&amp;#34; consultant (hunting for victims) sent me a friend request. She started telling me all about the awesomeness of their products. Unblemish is made by Rodan &amp; Fields, the same creators of Proactiv (they sold the proactiv line and came up with this overpriced, supposedly amazing new formula), it costs 3 times more than Proactiv but they promise positive results or your money back. I was desperate to try something new and even though I didn&#x27;t want to pay $150 every two months I decided to give it a try (if they give me my money back there&#x27;s nothing to lose right?). Consultant insisted I&#x27;d wait AT LEAST 6-8 weeks to see results. 8 wks went by and my face, far from getting better, it got way WORSE. She INSISTED it&#x27;s the products &amp;#34;detoxing&amp;#34; my face but I should try another 2 months with a different toner because the one toner I ordered gave me A GAZILLION blackheads (which was never an issue before) I fell for it and ordered another 2 month regimen; 3 and a half months (from the first use) my face got like this: http://i.imgur.com/0ARb2yS.jpg (first 4 pictures of course). I am 33 yrs old, I had NEVER seen my face so acne-infested and in pain like that. I was depressed, self conscious, embarrassed! Make up would make me look like a reptile!!! I was ranting on an online forum and someone recommended &amp;#34;Nature&#x27;s Cure&amp;#34;; these homeopathic over-the-counter pills regulate your acne and hormonal/diet imbalances by working from the inside. Within weeks: Cystic pimples: NONE! Pores: reduced. Blackheads: gone! Now, make no mistake, my face isn&#x27;t perfect, I am wearing makeup (last pic) to cover the scars and pigmentation Unblemish left! But my face is acne clear and sooo smooth!!! I sent the Unblemish products back and even though I only got 1 regimen&#x27;s money back, I am happy I discovered Nature&#x27;s Cure! I mean, $11 a month REALLY?!!! I went ahead and ordered the 3 month supply even before finishing my first month to ensure getting it here on time. I also got back to using Proactiv just to keep it as part of my cleaning daily routine, so both as a combination work like a charm!!! If you&#x27;ve read &#x27;til here, thank you, if you&#x27;re struggling with hormonal or cystic acne, give it a try!!! For $11 there&#x27;s nothing to lose! 2 chewable pills a day and within a week even my husband noticed I was not getting huge lumps that were deforming my face like before (and they were painful as heck!) now I just need to work on getting rid of the scars but seriously, this stuff changed MY LIFE. I&#x27;m on my second month and I have not had ONE cystic pimple while using it! Around the time of my period I got 2 tiny zits that were gone in 2 days. I use the cream for those but really, I barely use it because I don&#x27;t even need to! If anyone is struggling with acne please know THERE IS HOPE! To me, this is miracle and I say it everyday when I take my pill! Happy New Year! and stay beautiful!res: reduced. Blackheads: gone!

    <li> This is the only thing that will keep my acne away! I love this product so much. I have tried SO MANY products to help with my acne but this tops them all. I stopped using this and tried taking Zinc for acne but it made my acne worse. I will never make the same mistake and stick with what works. Thank you Nature&#x27;s Cure! :D</li>
    <li> Unfortunately did not work for me</li>
    <li> First of all, let me start by saying that this product really works for me. I started to see results after the first week of using it. I&#x27;m an African American woman in my late twenties and I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin since about 19.  I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, Murad and a host of other acne treatments, but none of them worked for me. Now after 6 months of using Nature&#x27;s Cure, my face is acne free and almost completely clear of dark spots. I stretched my supply out to 2 months, so I&#x27;m sure if you used it as prescribed, you&#x27;d see even better results than I experienced. This product is easy to use and reasonably priced.  It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing. It clears my acnes in just a few days. I suffered from adult acne for a long time. It comes and goes every once a while. Nature&#x27;s Cure helps me get in control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have some side effects. Your skin gets dry, especially the area you use the cream on. It also causes itches on your ears and nose.</li>
    <li> I used for a little over a month and took as directed and it did not clear up my skin actually made me break out in places I never have before and made existing acne worse. Just be warned may not work for you the way it does for others</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Pharmapacks! I cant review the vanishing cream yet but the pills do work for me. I had my period yesterday without any new pimples which is awesome! Usually I would have 2-3 new ones. Ive been taking for only a week.</li>
    <li> It actually made me break out worse. It might work for others, but it did not for me.</li>
    <li> The benzoyl peroxide in the cream is the only thing that could make this work, and it&#x27;s not in a high enough concentration. The pills are basically sugar pills. If you want to heal from the inside, try cutting out sugar and dairy.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me! But received it super quick</li>
    <li> O.K. so this may not work for everyone because, let&#x27;s face it, not everyone gets acne for the same reasons! However, it worked wonderfully for my son, who is 14 and has a bit of acne. Not lots, but during the summer he breaks out more because he is very active and outdoors a lot (sweating). This literally cleared his face up within 2 days.He doesn&#x27;t use the cream because it&#x27;s harsh. If he uses it, he says he breaks out more (it does dry the skin and as a way to bring moisture back to the surface, the skin will get oily, which can cause breakouts...it&#x27;s a cycle...only use the cream sparingly on big sores...don&#x27;t smear it all over your face) His face looks so nice now. I started using this product as well because right before my period, I sometimes break out (mildly) and this makes my skin very clear and smooth. I also do not really use the cream. I love this product. I hate when I run out. The only con I can see is the 40 or so million tubes of cream we have laying around...what do I do with this stuff??</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old and I stopped(mistake) using this product a few months before deployment to iraq because I thought that I found something that worked a whole lot better but while on deployment my skin broke out really bad from the dust and dirt in the air, so I decided to go back to this product.  I found that this product worked very quickly and it even gave my skin a refreshing look.  What I did notice is that in the summertime the product does cast a little shawdow giving you a darker look and fading blemishes away, which I really like because I didnt have to wear makeup.  I was surprise when I went to work and my co-workers asked me if I had makeup on and I said no, they all stated that my skin look really good which gave me a big smile on my face.  I really advice you to give this a try it is a wonderful product......I HOPE IT WORKS FOR YOU!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 9 months..... Taking a short break after the 6th month (as directed). This is the ONLY thing that works for my cystic acne. Also easy to buy on here than Walmart.</li>
    <li> This is the best ever!!!</li>
    <li> This product is working very well for my teenage daughter. I didn&#x27;t want to give her antibiotic medication everyday for her acne. I found this homeopathic remedy and was very happy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for awhile and I love it. I tried so many other things such as proactive, accutane, and other doctor prescribed acne medicines and nothing has worked. I do not use the cream part of Natures Cure but I do use the pills. I like them because they are tasteless and you don&#x27;t have to take them at the exact same time each day, and if you forget one... it&#x27;so okay. I have reccomended this product to several other people who have also had success with it. It is not a product that you can expect to see results over night from, but give it a month or so and you might be surprised. The down fall to this product for me, is that if I stop using it for a few months my acne comes back but, $10/month is a low price to pay for confidence. So, if you&#x27;re one of those people who can&#x27;t find anything to cure acne or reduce it&#x27;s severity I would definitely try natures cure... and don&#x27;t worry about the cream, I would suggest only using it if you absolutely need to. Natures cure also makes a face wash system which works great paired with the pills but, it is not a necessity.</li>
    <li> Because the system is formulated to treat the skin inside and out, my skin alleviates the problem areas and looks close to flawless. Ironically, it works wonders to keep you healthy during the flu season, because it&#x27;s a homeopathic. I&#x27;ve used it for years and highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had uneven skin with breakouts (lucky me!) The only thing that kept the breakouts at bay was birth control.  But wanting to start a family, I had to forego the birth control and back came the breakouts! I tried EVERY cream and product on the shelf.  I steered clear of this product because I really didn&#x27;t want to add yet another pill to my daily routine but I was desperate.  It&#x27;s been about 2.5 weeks and I am seeing a HUGE difference in my skin. YAY!!!! I give this product 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone trying to clear up their face. FWIW, this isn&#x27;t only for teens, I am 33. Cheers to clear skin!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this to all my kids and works beautiful.  Poor teenagers look like pizza face when they don&#x27;t take it.  Nothing else worked.  Their sound looks a million times better and there is no dryness and no skin peeling.</li>
    <li> I use this in addition to other products...I would not recommend it on its own. It seems to maybe cut my skin problems in half, but does not take them away completely. Still, if you&#x27;re looking for something to help with your other products, this should do the trick.</li>
    <li> I used to always get one pimple once in a while but never like I just did a month ago. I got a really bad breakout and it&#x27;s starting to heal, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product or it&#x27;s  just simply my body, however, I&#x27;ve gotten two more cystic pimples.</li>
    <li> I actually did not use the vanishing cream... But the pill sure works if used as directed nd dnt forget to drink fluids after chewing the pills.</li>
    <li> No. No healing on my few but stubborn adult acne blemishes. No changes in my skin.  No change in frequency of  new breakouts. Just no.</li>
    <li> This is a holy grail product for me. I had very very severe acne. I have tried every possible thing on the market. This is the only thing that has worked. And none of the dryness thats usually caused by chemical products. Love love love this.&lt;br /&gt;Although my skin is now super clear, i still have this cream handy for an occasional zit that pops up during my periods. i dot it over my zit and its gone by morning. I am 30+ years old and this has worked like a miracle for me. Also recommended to many friends who have benefitted from it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Natures Cure. It&#x27;s the only product that has been able to take away my acne. I can tell a huge difference when I stop using it!</li>
    <li> Starts working after about 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Did nothing at all for me, saw no change good or bad.</li>
    <li> I love this item. I have used it for about 4 years along with clean and clear facial detox daily cleaner. It works wonders for me. I only use it once a day or my skin dries out. I only use a pea size amount and each tube last me arojnd 2-3 months. I don&#x27;t take the pills though. My doctor informed me that these pills can make birth control less effective. Other then that I would recommend this product to anybody.  DO NOT TAKE PILLS IF YOUR ON BIRTH CONTROL. just use the cream.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money, if you have acne, go to see a Doctor. I ordered this product because I did not want to go to see a Doctor, I used the cream and the pills. My acne did not go away at all.</li>
    <li> Did nothing, was hoping that this would work, i have tried everything for my acne and this just gets added to the list, used religiously didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had combo skin, and bad breakouts around my cycle, and I got so tired of spending so much $$$$ on trying to find something to control it.  I heard a lot of positive things about this product, so I tried it out.  Within 3 days, there was a very noticeable difference! My face was 99% clear and stayed that way the whole month. Any little blemish that popped up, the cream took care of overnight.  My only complaints are that the cream is drying, and after the one month that I took it, I saw my skin was clear, so I stopped taking it.  As soon as I got my period, my face broke out worse than it ever had.  No worries, I purchased it again and within 3 days it was clear.  I will continue to use this product, and recommend it to anyone who has mild skin issues and believes that there is NOTHING you can do, you&#x27;ve tried everything in everything failed.  This doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t use this anymore but these were ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to keep her face clear during her early teens. We tried every single thing and nature&#x27;s cure was the only thing that helped.  She used it for years until discovering Differin which is what she uses now</li>
    <li> If you can religiously remember to take them 2 or 3 times a day they really do work. Clear my back up a lot. Not all the way, but a lot.</li>
    <li> A little over a month ago I was looking to switch to Acne pills because no topical creams or face washes would work for me. I have hormonal acne and I usually get about 2-3 pimple/nodules a week and that flares up even more a week before I get my period. I decided it was time to change and after seeing all the side effects of the other pills I decided I&#x27;d give these Natural pills a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I read over all of the reviews and saw that most people had great success with these pills so I decided to give it a shot. Everyone is different so I expected to be disappointed when they didn&#x27;t work. After about 2 weeks of taking 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill at night I honestly didn&#x27;t think i would see any results. BUT I DID ! I&#x27;m not even done with my 1st month&#x27;s supply yet &amp; I already ordered 2 more!!! I haven&#x27;t gotten any nodules or pimples since I started this treatment. I am ESPECIALLY IMPRESSED because usually I get 3 or more pimples before &amp; during my menstruation....but NOTHING !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I got 1 pimple right after I got my period but I took the pill that night and used some of the treatment cream on it before bed &amp; the next morning there was NOTHING THERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRUST ME I have used EVERYTHING BEFORE : Neutrogena Skin ID, Proactive, Clearsil, Clean and Clear, Noxema....EVERYTHING and nothing worked...or it just WASNT ENOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had great success with these pills, but there are a few things you should keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw results after 2 weeks and I didn&#x27;t change my diet (even though I should), I&#x27;ve been drinking alcohol and going to sleep late at night and I&#x27;ve still seen results !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Also in addition to taking these pills I still used 1 Neutrogena Acne Face Wash in the morning and a Neutrogena Naturals Make Up Remover was at night.  However...I was using these before and it wasn&#x27;t enough so the pills are really making a change !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE GIVE THIS PRODUCT A TRY ...IT IS SOOO CHEAP AND SOOO EFFECTIVE THAT EVEN IF IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK FOR YOU ..YOU ONLY SPENT ABOUT 10 DOLLARS TRYING IT OUT !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-STEPHANIE A.</li>
    <li> Out of frustration with all topical products,and believing the cause of my breakouts was hormonal, I tried Nature&#x27;s Cure. For me, it works. Be prepared to take it for a full month before seeing clear skin, then continue taking it. Years ago I tried it, my breakouts ceased, and I discontinued the product; my acne returned. I am back on it and breakouts are far fewer and less severe. It is reasonably priced, simple to take, and used with my other products, helps keep my acne under control. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I tried it on a whim earlier this year and have been buying it ever since. I never thought I would find such a simple solution to fix my adult acne. I love it so much I just purchased a three-month supply. I wish I could buy just the tablets though because I don&#x27;t use the face cream (it dried out my skin too much).</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this acne treatment. She uses it faithfully. It is an excellent price compared to others on the market. She has been using it for 2 years.</li>
    <li> On my second month using this products just the pills not the cream plus facial it really helps</li>
    <li> After using this product for half a month, I can already see my skin clearing up. Be careful, the cream bleaches towels and pillowcases (thankfully I was aware of this because I used to use cream with benzoyl peroxide all the time). It also dries your skin out really quickly but if you use a good moisturizer it doesn&#x27;t do too much damage. Overall I couldn&#x27;t be more happy that getting rid of my acne can be this easy!</li>
    <li> Had an allergic reaction</li>
    <li> I have tried A LOT of products for adult acne. THis is one that I keep going back to bc it really helps. This one (the male version) also helped my 14 yr old son. I wouldnt say that it just totally cures acne, but if you have some hormonal reasons that may be causing some acne, then this is definitely worth a try for you. I take them every day, and if I run out, I NOTICE. It not only helps acne, but really makes your skin look nicer in general. I love it. The cream included in the box is just like every other bez. peroxide cream out there, so its nothing special, but effective as usual.  I also take a biotin and a guggulsterone supplement with this. If you haven&#x27;t tried guggulsterones for acne or general skin health, you are missing out. [...] has a cheap effective guggulsterone supplement. Anyway, this combination works for me, and my teenage sons. TRY THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> I am 42 and female. I have tried EVERYTHING for cystic acne: expensive Beverly Hills dermatologists, antibiotics, pro-activ, MaxClarity, Mario Badescu, pretty much any and every over-the-counter and prescription medicine - internal and external.  I had gotten to the point where NOTHING worked and I was relying on cortisone injections at the dermatologist to try to keep it under control, which is pricey and painful.&lt;br /&gt;I finally ordered a Blue light lamp from Trophy Skin, which didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  HOWEVER, they also included Nature&#x27;s Cure for Females - 2 part system. I put it aside and thought that if my hardcore prescription drugs couldn&#x27;t control it, then these homeopathic pills could not either. I WAS WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;The day after I used the topical and began the pills, I could feel my very broken out chin starting to heal. I tried not to get hopeful because I have been let down so many times....BUT within 1 week, my face was clear of any new blemishes and all existing blemishes were nearly healed. Since that time (about 3 weeks ago) my face is 100% clear and I have no new cysts or breakouts AT ALL.  I don&#x27;t know how it works but I don&#x27;t care! I am so relieved and optimistic that I really found something. I say try it - for $10 it is worth it and there are no words to describe what it feels like to have clear skin - even during that time of the month - I could cry with happiness.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for hormonal acne! I tried everything and this cleared in a week! I do wish that they had refill packs for the homeopathic. I have ordered this 4 times and I&#x27;m still on the first bottle of vanishing cream!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have many acne, but once a month as a most women I do get pimple here and there. However, lately my skin has been breaking out a lot and I decided to try this out. I read reviews and thought to myself what do I have to lose by trying, not like its worth fortune. I hardly ever leave reviews, but it has been a week since I have been using this and I already have noticed differences in my skin. The cream does wonders on spot acne. I had a pimple on my neck, a night before I applied this cream, next day the pimple was gone ( amazing ). My face is acne free now.. It works for me, I also still use Clinique Face wash for oily skin twice a day. And Im very satisfied with the results so far.. I will be ordering more. Try it, you wont regret! Good Luck.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m in awe of this product.  it works like nothing else i&#x27;ve ever tried.  just took the pills twice (sometimes 3 times) a day.  didn&#x27;t use the benzoyl creme very often because i tend to put stuff like that on at night, but anything with benzoyl peroxide will bleach my sheets and pillowcase.  but using mostly just the pills by themselves and washing my face on a regular basis with my usual face wash has yielded amazing results!  i&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 weeks now and my skin has improved dramatically!  i am so happy with this product because it seemed like nothing else was working and was so harsh on my skin.  these pills dont have any harsh side effects and my skin is getting clear without getting dried out.  LOVE them!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works to cure my ances. I took it for more than a year. At first I took it twice a day, but after a few months, I took it once a day or every other day and it still works well on me. Highly recommen!</li>
    <li> My face (and particularly my chin) can&#x27;t live without it! Been using it for years and when I stop My face is a mess! Wish it was in Walgreen stores or Walmart.</li>
    <li> After months of trying different products like Proactive and other department store brands, I finally ordered this for my 13 year old daughter. Within days I could tell a difference in the redness and size of her acne. She has been taking it for almost 1 month now, and although she still has residual redness, she has had no new breakouts. I would recommend this to anyone struggling with acne. It is inexpensive, easy to use and you will see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: There is a direct correlation between dairy and acne. Although eliminating dairy didn&#x27;t help my daughter, acne suffers sometimes discover a reduction of symptoms after cutting it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nature&#x27;s Cure for several years now and I love it.  I never have any side effects, and it always helps to not only control my acne, but also my oily skin and hair.  Overall my complexion is so much better when I am using Nature&#x27;s Cure.  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I had pretty good skin most of my life until the year before I turned 40.  Every month I would get a very large blemish (about the size and height of a pencil eraser) on my chin.  I tried many over the counter products (including proactive) to no avail.  I even went to a fancy-pants skin renewal dermatology clinic.  They advertised lasers and all types of ways to cure acne but when they saw me, the basically said that my acne was hormonal and shrugged their shoulders and said the lasers and other treatments they had wouldn&#x27;t work on hormonal acne.  At this point, I was getting two very large blemishes a month and so my skin was always either broken out or red from healing.  The derm clinic did recommend using an adult acne treatment kit from dermalogica.  This helped little to none.  Anyway, saw the nature&#x27;s cure at Walgreens and it caught my eye because it was for women and since I knew my acne was hormonal I figured it was worth a try but didn&#x27;t really believe it would.  I was amazed!  I have not had a blemish since I started using this product at the end of October!!!  I am so pleased with this product.  I don&#x27;t even use the cream, just the pills (one every morning and night.)  I would recommend this to anyone, especially someone in their 30&#x27;s or 40&#x27;s who has hormonal acne.  Nature&#x27;s Cure has far exceeded my expectations.  I continue to use the dermalogica, Bare Essentials mineral makeup, and Nature&#x27;s Cure daily and have found this combination to be the perfect combination that has kept me blemish free for four months.  I always order on Amazon now to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> In the last year or so my acne has gotten out of control, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s hormones or what but changing my diet and excerise routine didn&#x27;t help so I&#x27;ve been trying different products. Nothing worked, Proactive, any of the drug store brand of washes/cleansers/systems. I remembered that I had used this awhile back but had to stop because it severely dried out my skin. I decided to try it out again. It&#x27;s only been 4 days and my acne is almost completely gone and what is left looks like it will be gone soon and no new break outs. I&#x27;m using this with Garnier gel-cream moisturizer and so far it seems to be helping to keep the Vanishing cream that comes in this package from drying out my skin. As for the pills, I was worried they&#x27;d taste horrible (you&#x27;re supposed to chew them) but they&#x27;re not even chalky and don&#x27;t taste like anything. For the price it is, it definitely was worth trying again. I sincerely hopes this works for you too.</li>
    <li> PILLS:&lt;br /&gt;I got this to balance hormone, hoping that it would get rid of adult acne.  After using it for nearly a month, I still have outbreaks (as usual) from time to time.  I don&#x27;t think it helped me, but I gave it one star because there were no bad side effects and it was relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CREAM:&lt;br /&gt;Same as other standard over-the-counter vanishing cream; works o-k, but causes drying.</li>
    <li> Works well, probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my acne at all, caused me to break out more</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve been using it for half a month and I&#x27;m noticing a difference.  Be sure to follow directions and take it consistently.  The cream dries my skin out a little but it works.</li>
    <li> This is my first review on Amazon so here I go.  I have been dealing with adult acne on &amp; off for 8 years now.  Tried many big name acne systems.  The only real success I had was going to dermatologist, paying for expensive creams, meds and procedures.  When a change in jobs kept me from keeping up with all that, the acne came back.  So I again tried to find something OTC that helped.  It took less than a month for my acne to clear up with this product!  I wish I had found it years ago and saved myself thousands of dollars (literally).</li>
    <li> This product really dried out my skin. It made it red, itchy and very tight. I will try and scale back to 1 pill a day instead of 2 and see if it helps. Really unsure if it&#x27;s the cream or the pills. So once I decrease the pills will see if condition improves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from adult acne following Mirena placement, and literally nothing, and I mean NOTHING, works other than this tablet. I tried washing my face obsessively, changing my diet, sulfur peels, everything imaginable. If I forget to take the tablets for &amp;#62;1day, I immediately begin breaking out. I&#x27;m shocked that a tablet I bought on amazon is the one cure I&#x27;ve been able to find, but I am so thankful for this tablet.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for us. My kids used these faithfully with no clearing of acne.</li>
    <li> I think this works really well. I used this when I was 15-16 and now I am 24 I will order more to help with a little bit of blemishes that I get. The cream does dry your skin out, but it also causes the acne to go away pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of products, including a well-named acne product on t.v. to no avail.  Unfortunately my acne is due to a hormonal imbalance and they are cystic.  I first started using these pills back in &#x27;06 and loved the results.  I decided to try them again since nothing else was working and to my happiness, they have kept my skin quite clear still.  I am not a doctor, but if you are experiencing acne due to a hormonal imbalance I would give these pills a try.  I do not use the cream, for it leaves my skin a bit irritated.  But the pills are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Just a day after taking the pill, my face was a lot smoother. My pore size reduced dramatically and my skin was acne free!</li>
    <li> Regarding the pills: if you are prone to getting headaches/migraines DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT! I suffer from hormonal acne around the chin and was hoping that this could clear it up for me. The first couple days I started taking it I saw my acne get worse, but that&#x27;s often what happens when you start new treatments. I also had bad headaches every night, but because I get them frequently, I figured it was because I wasn&#x27;t eating right or drinking enough water. However, I was getting headaches every single day since starting the pills. Apparently they have diluted amounts of arsenic in it, which is known to cause headaches. I saw all the good reviews on this product, and while I&#x27;m glad it worked for some people, it definitely doesn&#x27;t for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the cream: benzoyl peroxide is known to treat acne, and it does work. It will kill bacteria and dry up a pimple that you put it on. There will be flaking and maybe some burning, but it does work. I think it would be better to just buy benzoyl peroxide cream from somewhere else separately instead of the whole system.</li>
    <li> I broke me out horribly and my skin became very sensitive after a week... And i didnt have much acne to start with I just wanted to clear some pimples i occasionally get due to stress but i didnt react well w this</li>
    <li> Finally - something that works!  I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and have always had a pimple (or two) somewhere on my face, although I have tried everything topically that I could have.  Dermatologist visits, lasers or any lotion known to man and nothing was effective.  I decided enough was enough and wanted to try a much different approach by using something internal after reading a couple of articles on the ineffectiveness of topical applications.  At first I had a couple of bumps pop up, but I am sure that was just the toxins working themselves out,  But after the first 2 weeks I noticed that for probably the longest period of my life, nothing new was showing!  I am now a month in and very pleased with the results, I can even go to my workout class makeup free which is huge for me.  I also switched to Neutrogena Acne wash system, so the combination is proving to be very effective for me.  I will try and check back in a couple of months to let everyone know if the success was still ongoing, which I really hope that it is.</li>
    <li> Almost done with the 2nd box. No miracle, i.e. made all my acne disappeared, but definitely calmed the skin when it flared up. When I just started to take it, it made my period came one week earlier (usually is on time). I think it does have something to do with your hormone. It took a while, at least 7 days, to see the improvement on my skin. I&#x27;ll continue using it to maintain the skin condition.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. Made my skin super dry and peel. It did help a little bit with my acne, but not enough to deal with the skin drying out. I did start to use a moisturizer with it and that did help. I didn&#x27;t see any help from the pills. This product was not for me, waste of money!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all. I had only used it for a week when I noticed bumps everywhere on my face. These pills broke me out something horrible. I believe I came across something that is helping my breakouts internally. I like the fact that this course teaches you to control my acne from the inside with food, minerals, and vitamins. Acne is not a cure but if I can find something to keep the breakouts down (which I think I have) then that is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Pretty much these pills are amazing! I have been taking the pills for about 3 months now and my face has never been this clear. I was getting the bad hormonal acne on my neck and jawline.. and now I take these and also use skin beauty solutions salicylic acid peel and my face is so clear! If u struggle with acne please try these.. im soo glad I did</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old woman and for the past year I have been getting this awful, deep hormonal cyst acne. I&#x27;ve always had a great complexion so I was very upset when- in my late 20s - when all these worries are supposed to be OVER with - I start getting the worst acne in my life. It was sore and nothing would make it heal. I tried a number of topical treatments but nothing helped. As soon as one of the large bumps would begin to shrink another one or two would begin to grow. I was considering taking my chances and seeing a dermatologist for a cortisone shot to the face and taking my chances with the terrible effects that can have - then I stumbled upon this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never even opened the cream. The pills worked WONDERS on my face. Since I started taking them, my face cleared up and I&#x27;ve not had a single outbreak. It was crazy how fast it worked after nothing else would. I still get minor little pimpels but the hormal cyst stuff is gone and for that, I am completely in love with this product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this a few years ago as a teenager, when I had some acne.  It was nothing horrible, just a few pimples here and there.  I saw this at the store and gave it a try, did everything I was supposed to and the pores under my eyes increased in size.  I had larger pores after using this product and it took me a while to reduce their size.  I didn&#x27;t have much acne to begin with and this did seem to help, but the increased pores were a negative.</li>
    <li> If you have had acne for years and tried everything, give this a shot. My sister and I did and it worked. We dont use the cream that comes with it because it is too irritating to our skin. We just take the pills. My skin has cleared up so well. It took me about 4 months to really notice a change so dont expect miracles overnight.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim, because it was inexpensive, but am really impressed with how well it has worked so far. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks, but I have already seen an improvement.  I&#x27;m 32 and have struggled with acne for half my life. I have tried dozens of over the counter products and several prescriptions including Accutane. This works better than 95% of everything else I have tried. My face seems to be clearing up a lot in general and when I do get a pimple it is much smaller and quicker to heal then it has before using this product.   I liked it so much, I went out and bought 2 more months worth already, and am looking forward to seeing even more great results in the future. I also bought the male version for my little brother and insisted he try it too.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS NOW DIFFICULT TO FIND IN MY SMALL HOMETOWN .  ALOT EASIER  FOR ME TO ORDER OFF  THE INTERNET INSTEAD OF RUNNING AROUND TOWN TRYING  TO FIND IT.</li>
    <li> This treatment did work very nice for me. But beware, do not expect to see any miracle cure instantly. It took me a whole 1 month treatment to actually see the results. However, I am very pleased to see my face now that I have almost no acne at all. Even though during the first month I noticed I did breakout more than ever, it seemed like the treatment was making it all come out and now that I finished the first month I can see the wonderful results. I highly recommend this treatment to women like me with hormonal acne issues.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my teenage daughter and it works fantastic. Purchased the men&#x27;s system for my son also.  When the kids stop taking the supplements, the acne comes back but goes away within a couple days after starting again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne all growing up, and even though I&#x27;m almost 30years old I still get acne.  I tried a lot of prescription products, over the counter products, Proactiv, etc, and they never really worked for me.  I started using Nature&#x27;s cure and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.  Every once and a while I have a zit or two, but the acne is gone.  I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> My bf recommended this product. He&#x27;s been using it, since he was 19, and plagued w acne. I&#x27;ve just recently been reintroduced to my own plague of cystic, hormonal acne after changing BC.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 7days so far, and it&#x27;s already saved me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried chemical peels, department store acne products, and popular drug store brands. No help. Lots of inflammation and damage.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried 2 different gf&#x27;s Derm topicals. It was a disaster. I just hope you find this product, before you havta do months of all that other traumatizing stuff like me. Bf gets an &#x27;A+&#x27;. Please don&#x27;t stop making this Nature&#x27;s Cure!!&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived the projected day. Thank You</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and for the past couple of years I have been breaking out like clockwork a couple of weeks before my period.  I  tried every ance cream/facewash  under the sun and nothing would work. I was beyond frustrated. Finally, I found this product and read some of the reviews and decided to give it a shot.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for a couple of months now and I have not had a single breakout! I think the overall appearance of my skin has improved too. I love this product!</li>
    <li> When I was younger this pill really helped with my teenage acne. Now that I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s (and still breakingout) it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same effect as it once did. But it did actually help regulate my cycles and clear up most hormonal acne,</li>
    <li> Made me feel sick at my stomach.</li>
    <li> I do not know what tablets are doing but cream was very drying even for oily skin. My daughter was using it and she got rashes all over her face. I will not recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past, and this is my second time trying this out. It worked before, and since my skin is pretty bad again, I  thought I would give it another go. I&#x27;m about halfway through the packet, and it seems to be working well for me again. I only use the benzyl peroxide cream at night though, because it does really dry out my skin. I still am experiencing some acne, but this definitely has gotten the worse of it... hopefully I won&#x27;t need to purchase again, but if you do continuously have skin problems, this is always a good product to turn to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the acne cream for over a month now. It very drying but i do not see an improvement for my acne. The cream also burns my eyes every time i use it and i don&#x27;t understand why because IM NOT even putting it near my eye. which i thought was weird and i hate that. As for the pills, i&#x27;ve only took have of one packet. I didn&#x27;t even take it like how it was suggested on the directions because I hate how you have to chew it. I wish it was a pill that you can swallow. Its tasteless but i just dont like the fact that i have to chew it down. Either way I wouldnt recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and really works! Just give it at least a week or two. The best acne treatment I&#x27;ve used so far and I used so many. :)</li>
    <li> It was amazing to see my hormonal acne around my mouth disappear. It feels like I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of it, even taking pills before. Nothing seemed to work until I decided to give this a try. It hasn&#x27;t worked for the acne in my tzone, but I&#x27;ll be buying Nature&#x27;s Cure acne system to see if that helps.</li>
    <li> Works great, Feels Good On Skin. The Lotion Does Not Dry Your Skin Out Either, and the pills do not taste like medicine :)</li>
    <li> Really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in using this product.  However I did try Nelsons Homeopathic Sulfur Tablets and had absolutely ah-mazing results with it.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Works really well on me.</li>
    <li> Its great but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is it leaves a chemical burn sometimes. The pills don&#x27;t have a bad taste but for some reason they make me emotional.</li>
    <li> I am a 25 year old female, and I&#x27;ve been battling acne since I was probably 10.  Since I was a teen, I&#x27;ve used Proactiv.  It always worked well for me, but it gets pretty expensive.  I decided to give Nature&#x27;s Cure a try.  It seems like a lot of the other reviewers are calling this product a miracle and your skin is magically clear.  Well, after using it for about a month now, I can say this product was not a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; for me.  My skin is clearer, but I still have acne, it&#x27;s just not as bad.  However, that being said, I will continue to use this product for one reason:  Every month, a week or so before my period, I always get big cystic pimples.  Mostly on my back, but also on my face.  I&#x27;m due for my period any day now, and I have yet to have any cystic acne pop up on my back and face.  Since cystic acne is caused by excess oil buildup from hormonal imbalances caused by your period, I&#x27;m confident that the Nature&#x27;s Cure tablets are keeping my oil production in check, especially around the time of my period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, Nature&#x27;s Cure isn&#x27;t giving me beautiful flawless skin, but it is helping with period-related acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks so far, already noticing a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have minor acne along the sides of my face, and major acne scars on the sides as well. I can&#x27;t say for sure that it helped any with the scars, but it is most definitely doing it&#x27;s part clearing existing acne on my face. Skin is a lot smoother and my complexion is brighter. I will be purchasing more in the near future!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I have acne practically all my life, I am a 43 year old lady, the only thing that helped me in the past was taking birth control pills, but decided I didn&#x27;t wanted to take then anymore, since I took them for 10 years or so, I have heard that is not good to take them for so long, as soon as I stop taking them, my acne come back, it was not a severe acne, but bad enough to bother me. I read positive reviews about this product, and gave it a try, only one week after I started taking them, I already notice a big difference, I haven&#x27;t got any new pimple and the old ones had practically disappeared. I will recommend this product to any one I know.</li>
    <li> Tried it.  Didn&#x27;t really notice any change.  It didn&#x27;t make it worse, but it barely made it better.  Mike work better for others.</li>
    <li> This cream/gel does not seem to cause my skin to peel. Love that. I can usually see results overnight. I don&#x27;t really take the pills but have in the past and they seemed to be soothing - a little like resolving acid in the system. I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s what they do, but, they do seem soothing.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both use this and if we do it as directed it works.  My daughter stopped when her face cleared up and they came back. So I recommend using them per the directions I have not stopped and my skin is clear and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. it is well worth the money. I works better than proactive has worked for me and cheaper</li>
    <li> This item did not help with my break outs, My break outs has worsen. I even asked if there is a expiration date on the products which I cannot locate. No answer back from the seller regarding the Expiration date. Wish this would help with my break outs but it did not, I wish I could get my money back. The only down side to this item is there is no expiration date for the pills or cream. I dont want to keep using something which I have no idea when it expires.</li>
    <li> i used all of these and the creme i actually ended up getting few months worth and took them for 3 months and its not worth the money these did nothing for me</li>
    <li> This is great product, I have been buying n buying it over again, suggested to my friend. And she loved it too</li>
    <li> Love it. Initially purchased for my teenage son who declared, &amp;#34;this is the best zit cream, ever!&amp;#34;  As an acne sufferer, I gave it a shot and agreed thAt it is the best.  Pimples dry up very fast.  I purchased a second  tube for myself.  We are hooked.</li>
    <li> I have used several new products and seen results so I can&#x27;t be sure if it is nature&#x27;s cure or the combination. Too afraid to stop and find out.</li>
    <li> Impressed with this product&#x27;s effectiveness.  In a rather short time, skin cleared.  Will reorder and recommend to other preteen girls.</li>
    <li> Love it so far. I already feel the change after only 3 days. Just need to get rid of my bad habits like touching my face</li>
    <li> Highly impressed by this product. I read loads of reviews because I wanted somthing a little more natural and less harsh for my face as I was dealing with a hormonal balance causing acne. Within a week my fact was looking 20x better and the products didn&#x27;t leave me feeling odd or dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver. Like many other users, I am not a teen. I started using this at age 21. I still do now---I&#x27;m 26. Use a moisturizer with SPF 15 over the acne cream. After applying the cream, wait for it to quickly dry for a couple minutes....or not if you have no time. You then pat on the moisturizer. I use Oil of Olay  Complete Daily moisturizer with SPF 15--use the normal skin (pink letters) if you have rather dry skin...this gives skin a stronger moisturizing effect; a little more over powering the acne cream. Use the one for sensitive skin (green words and or outlines) if you have rather oily skin that is more prone to population s of acne...this will give the acne cream a stronger effect.  Use the cream and moisturizer two times each day. I do it in the afternoon ...leave on for two to four hours or so. Wash it off....Use it again before I go to bed. You can schedule the acne cream regimen however you like...as long as it is done twice a day with a few hours rest in between. Remember to take the pills morning and night....or about 12 hours apart.... You decide on that with your schedule...Please people...give this a try. It worked wonders for me. And?? It is all NATURAL!! It&#x27;s extracted from herbs and roots of plants!! There is less worries on future adverses...unlike all the medicines that are claimed to treat acne (out there). This costs only 10 bucks a month!!!! If you decide to follow my regimen, the Olay costs 5 bucks ...which could be used at other times besides with the acne cream...The Olay could last for  more than a month! Use as much over the acne cream as you think you need. Please don&#x27;t waste money on Proactiv or expensive acne products..Nature&#x27;s cure is all natural, nice to your wallet, and works!!! I would not waste my time writing this much if I were not serious. Please, try this....</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an acne treatment, definitely try this. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and has been very effective in our house.</li>
    <li> Arrived with shrink wrap off the box.  Cap was off the peroxide tube which caused it to drip on the bottom of the.  Sam&#x27;s online was not at all apologetic when I informed them of this.  Not very helpful.  Never again!</li>
    <li> My skin got worse within days of starting the product.</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing that has worked for me ! Finally I found a cure for me acne. I am really happy to have tried this product. It is amazing. It truly works from the inside, and keeping the acnes at bay.</li>
    <li> very satisfied, works like magic!!! all my acne cleared up in less than two weeks, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product ...recommend this product to anyone who suffers from mild- severe acne.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about buying this product. And I was wrong! I had some terrible acne on my face. Yep, it didn&#x27;t look good at all. It would take weeks to heal and there will be always a new ones forming! ( I had that problem for about 6 month) so, I didn&#x27;t want to go to the doctor to pay 20$ for a visit just to get a prescription on a acne medicine. BUY THIS! Trust me, it will clear your skin! Some people say that creme is too strong, but so is any freaking acne medicine! It took me 2 month to make my skin look flawless, really flawless! I recommend it!! It will help you ! Good luck on your healing journey !</li>
    <li> As a 37 year old female, I have struggled with acne since turning 30.  I have been to the dermatologist and tried nearly every over the counter product available.  I always felt that what was truly causing my acne was related to hormone fluctuation.  This tiny pill has changed my life!  I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has tried &amp;#34;everything else&amp;#34;.  This pill works from the inside out.  I have not had a single blemish since beginning this medication 2 months ago including that time of the month.  I will never go without this all natural wonder drug again!</li>
    <li> Yeah, so I randomly started breaking out on my chin and under my nose after not having to worry about acne for the last 10+ years.  Still don&#x27;t know what is going on - but I think I have been using this cream and taking the pill (chewing it, as it suggests) for 4 days now, and the acne I had is gone or totally &amp;#34;dried out&amp;#34; and on it&#x27;s way to being gone. And when I say dried out, I do not mean my skin is dry... the zits are just shrunken down. No new break-outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help you decide if this is for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I am 28, had acne as a teenager, and barely any since (until now for some reason).&lt;br /&gt;-I have an only T-zone (combination skin).&lt;br /&gt;-The amount of acne that diminished within the last 4-5 days was mild/moderate; I would say I had a tiny cluster of zits, one big one, and a few other random tiny ones in my lower T-zone area.&lt;br /&gt;-My skin has not been dry or oily from the cream.&lt;br /&gt;-The pill is chewable and doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything; has the consistency of Tums (chalky) but much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;-The pill is to be taken twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;-I have not been using anything but face wash in combination with the cream (I use Earth Science gentle exfoliating scrub).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always skeptical of things that get good reviews because for some reason they always end up not being as awesome as people say - but I am very pleased with this product. I will continue to buy as long as my skin is being a pain in the butt.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why this works so well for my acne - all I know is that it does.  Happy to find it is available on Amazon!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! It really helps with acne a lot for both the male brand and female.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling so many types of acne for so long... i had to try something and the reviews where so good and its a natural product. after just three days i started to see dramatic changes in my skin. my face and chest cleared up like a dream. my cousin saw how well it was working for me see stole some of my supplies i will be making this my permanent go to product for my acne.</li>
    <li> The cream made my already acne-ridden face break out at a whole new level.  The medication gave me terrible dry mouth, and problems with my bladder.  Stay away!</li>
    <li> Currently trying another system (clearzine) to get rid of my acne... simply because it had a pretty good rating, but so far, Nature&#x27;s Cure takes the cake! Once I finish these bottles, I&#x27;m going back to Nature&#x27;s Cure!</li>
    <li> l asked for natures cure for males not females so was not happy with what I got please make sure it does not happen again</li>
    <li> I just got this product and I still think it is too soon before I can accurately give an accurate review on what it has done for my skin.  But I can say I LOVE the Vanishing Cream.  This is the ONLY product I have ever put on my face that is completely scentless.  So many products have claimed to be scentless yet have a weird smell. This product is super hydrating (shocking) considering this product contains acne medication that is known to dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> Works great. I keep buying this set and i have also recommended this product to some friends. They stop selling this at wal mart in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this brand! I went A couple months without being able to buy this and my pimples came back, the moment I started using again they vanished!&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the 3 step papaya plan they have and it took care of my back pimples too! :D</li>
    <li> I started using this product 3 almost 4 years ago and my face was clearer than it has ever been! The walmart store I do my shopping at though stopped selling it so I went a long time with out it until now. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my face hasn&#x27;t cleared up right away like other people have claimed but after a month or so it starts working very well at least from when I first used it. Like everyone else has said the cream is very harsh but I use it when my face still feels oily or greasy after washing it or on pimples I still have. It drys them up fast and stops them from getting worse. This product is a few dollars cheaper at walmart than here and I&#x27;m glad to say they finally brought it back recently. It&#x27;s nice to know I can still get it here though if they&#x27;re out of stock at the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman in my early 40s...I started breaking out in my 20s and 30s and could never figure out how to get the breakouts to stop!  Mine were definitely hormone-related, i.e., I always seemed to breakout around my time of the month.  I&#x27;ve been on the pill; that helped to an extent.  But not enough--and I&#x27;ve been off it a few years now.  I do have to add that I switched from liquid drug-store make-up to mineral make-up, and that has helped tremendously.  However, I was still breaking out on occassion, and it was unsightly and embarrassing.  I tried Pro-activ with great hope, but the product didn&#x27;t work.  I tried other acne kits (mostly from Walmart), such as Neutrogena (I usually love their products), but nothing worked.  I even used a sample of a prescription product, but no change. Then, I saw Nature&#x27;s Cure on the shelf.  I figured, what the heck, I&#x27;ve tried everything else, and for under $10, it was worth a shot.    The acne cream can be a bit irritating to your skin at first--I even got a small, dry, peeling area on my chin from it.  But, I started using it less often and that helped.  I now use it as needed, and can use it often, as my skin has seemed to have \\&quot;gotten used to it.\\&quot;  And the pills--WONDERFUL!!  These pills have no side effects, and my skin looks great because of them.  If I even get a pimple, it&#x27;s usually small and clears up quickly.  I rarely see breakouts anymore, and if I do, they&#x27;re not much (just up the use of the cream).  My skin feels smoother and seems healthier.  I absolutely LOVE this stuff!  So here I am, ordering it from Amazon, because now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere!  Sometimes Rite-Aid will have it, sometimes not.  Walmart doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.  I don&#x27;t know why.  Maybe not enough people are giving this product a shot....and they really should.  There is nothing more frustrating than having to go on a quest for a product that you love and know works well.  And with the cost of Nature&#x27;s Cure, I can&#x27;t think of anything more perfect than effectiveness combined with value.  I&#x27;ll be a customer for life, as long as I can find it!</li>
    <li> Headed into college and due to many things (environment change, stress, bad eating habits, hormones) I suddenly had a severe case of acne, and broke out EVERYWHERE! Huge, cystic acne on every part of my face, mainly on my cheeks. I had about 4-5 new pimples each day after waking up, and continuously popped them in the mornings in sadness wondering when would it ever end. I wore pounds of makeup to cover the bumps and redness every single day, and couldn&#x27;t bare my face to anyone at night after I had taken off my makeup because of embarrassment, not even my own roommate. I had tried literally everything, but then I realized maybe I needed to start internally instead of applying products externally. After battling with severe acne for about 6 months, I&#x27;m happy to say that within ONE MONTH of taking these pills my skin cleared up, with many scars left over. It&#x27;s been one year since I&#x27;ve been taking these pills and I am no longer embarrassed to show my bare face, even in public! Truly a miracle product!</li>
    <li> I tried these homeopathy pills in the past. I stuck to this homeopathy routine for a whole 6 months.  I never saw improvement on my skin from taking these pills. I am surprised that I stuck to this homeopathic product for a good 6 months. I think I gave this product a fair chance. This just did NOT do anything for me. This goes to show not every product works the same for everyone, but I can see it works for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, what works the best for my skin is BC pills, vitamins and herbal tea. I started taking all that after I found out the root cause of my breakouts. My doc told me my t-levels were a little high for a female. High t-levels in a woman &#x3D; hormone imbalance. If you are a woman with adult acne, get your hormones checked and find out if that is the root cause.</li>
    <li> I stopped buying this product because I could not find it in my local drug store.  My face started to break out because of stress and after trying several different organic products, nothing was working.  I searched and found Nature&#x27;s Cure in Amazon and I am glad I did!  My face cleared up in days and I have not had a serious breakout since!  Now I use it sparingly on hotspot areas to keep my skin clear.  I swear by Nature&#x27;s Cure now!</li>
    <li> These magic pills do work!</li>
    <li> This works better for me than any other ache product. In addition any cuts will heal several days quicker. Also helps promote hair and nail growth.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all waist of my time and money. Wish i could find a product that really works.</li>
    <li> For many years I&#x27;ve tried topical acne medication and it&#x27;s been an on and off relationship. After reading some reviews, I decided to give this a try. For 4 months now I have been relatively acne free, with very few pimples and zits here and there once every few weeks. My huge breakouts are completely gone and the skin on my face has never been so clean before! I don&#x27;t use the cream very often, but when I do on growing pimples, it stops them from growing any larger and they disappear within a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tablets took around 2 weeks for my skin to start clearing up. Since then, I also had my sister try them and it took around a week for hers to start clearing up. I will continue to buy this product for life!</li>
    <li> It work for its intended purpose but I had to stop using this product cos it made my cycle really irregular.</li>
    <li> this item is super good better than any other products I&#x27;ve tried works well and is easy to use it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
    <li> I usually never write reviews but i had to for this because i have been using this continually to keep my skin problems under control. I&#x27;ve had moderate to severe acne since i was 15 had to take all sorts of prescription creams and antibiotics to clear it up, my acne is more moderate to mild now that i &#x27;am 23 but i just got sick of wearing concealer everyday when no one else my age had too because they outgrew their skin problems. I really didn&#x27;t expect much from this product because of the price and almost immediately ordered the more expensive accutane knock offs but decided to give this a try, let me say i&#x27; m sure glad i did! Ever since i have been using this product my skin has been completely acne free, but if i miss a day or two my skin will break out again that is the only draw back but it sure beats paying the big $ for prescriptions that are full of unnatural substances.  The cream is really good too.</li>
    <li> First off, the delivery was super fast. I got it in about three days after placing the order. I have been taking the pills religiously and have seen improvement to my acne. I have not had a break out since and I am very pleased about that. I apply the cream once a day though, since I don&#x27;t want to over dry my face. It burns my eyes a little but it quickly cools off. My face feels soo soft and I am absolutely happy that the acne is leaving. I have blemishes from previous acne that are fading away also.</li>
    <li> Came much earlier than expected. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product it works for me every time and anyone I suggest it for. Its so hard to find in stores plus it&#x27;s more expensive. The vanishing cream doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell to it and dries almost instantly so u won&#x27;t have to worry about it. The medicine is a melt in your mouth and has no taste whatsoever. I like it because its curing ur acne from the inside and if u have acne in weird places (neck, back, arms, etc.) It helps as well. And since its natural it doesn&#x27;t have any problems with other products.</li>
    <li> This is the best zit cream!!  My teenagers use it and it has completely cleared their skin.  They don&#x27;t use the tablets, but the cream is great just by itself.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter&#x27;s acne has improved dramatically with this product. They used to sell it at our local Walmart but it was discontinued. So glad it&#x27;s here on Amazon and at a great price too! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that seems to work on my adult acne. I began using 10 years ago and swear by it!</li>
    <li> Not sure that the pills really did anything but the gel worked well for drying up blemishes I already had.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, will continue to order more!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all. Was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is the only product that completely cleared up my skin. I bout this product in the beginning of December and I ran out of pills early January. I thought since I didn&#x27;t have any more pills to take my face would begin to break out again but it hasn&#x27;t. Actually, my skin is getting better each day and I am still using the vanishing cream of course.  Like many people, I tried almost everything from dermatologist, black soap, over the counter products, change in diet, more water consumption and more but nature&#x27;s cure worked with promising results.   Now, when I first began taking the pills and using the cream I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference but I kept using the product (so glad I did). I would say that it takes a month for this product to fully work.  However, I did you acne free 3 step solution with this product.   My daily routine (including taking the pills night and day religiously):  Acne free face wash (twice a day)  Acne free toner (twice a day)  Nature&#x27;s cure cream (twice a day)  Acne free moisturizer (twice a day)   I highly recommend this product to any one with mild to moderate acne. I have had trouble with acne for three years now and this is the first time in three years that I have CLEAR skin! Use this product for a month and don&#x27;t give up on it!</li>
    <li> Ive been taking it for weeks and I dont see a difference.. waste of time and money. I wish I could get mine back.</li>
    <li> The pills that go along with the system did not work. In fact, it made my skin worsen. I have to stop after the first 15 days because tiny pumps were visible all over my cheeks and forehead. I know that a lot of reviewers stated that it got better after that but I usually don&#x27;t get that much acne until I started taking the pills! However, the creme is very effective. Right now, I just use the crème as my nightly routine. I am very glad it works for others though</li>
    <li> I really really wanted these to work for me after reading all the good reviews. I took them as directed for a month and did not see much of a difference. I am on the fence about giving them a second try. The cream on the other hand worked good for about a week and then it started drying out my skin (I only applied it once a day at night time) after that I used it sparingly and did not see the same result. Note: I have mild to moderate acne on my face and back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it made a dramatic difference in my skin. I tried every product out there and Nature&#x27;s cure hands-down is the only product that keeps my skin clear.</li>
    <li> The pills did nothing for me other than giving me a few rashes, so I stopped on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the &#x27;vanishing cream&#x27; helps with the diminishing of acne (bumps, scars) which is excellent. It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;vanish,&#x27; but it does help decrease the amount as well as decrease higher chances of getting more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the vanishing cream is small, it packs a lot of product and it lasts a long time. I have had this product for a months, and I still have some left.</li>
    <li> Im 35 years old and I&#x27;ve been fighting acne since  i was 27 approximately. My acne type is 4-8 pimples (small /medium size) around the mouth and cheeks monthly . Every other month, I have one big pimple that gets nasty and leaves me scars :(  I used this product for four months back in 2012 and it did wonders for my skin. However, there was maybe 1-2 mini pimples who disappeared quickly without leaving permanent marks. I was so happy to find it because i used so many products , treatments, etc and nothing worked. After that period I got pregnant so I discontinued using . A couple of months ago, my acne reappeared ( after my pregnancy and stopping breastfeeding ) . So I restarted my treatment with these pills  3 weeks but , so far my skin is acne-free. I know that i have to expect one or two pimples here and there, but overall is gonna be a huge difference than without it. I really recommend everyone to give it a try there is nothing to lose , but please wait at least one month to start seeing at least some change. The time that you start taking it&#x27;s has been for me also very detrimental try to start it right before your period finishes , so then you start your hormonal cycle with the pill , avoid to start it in the middle of your hormonal cycle or right before your period starts because in my own experience mad  things words. Remember what these herbs do its to regulate your hormonal cycle ( which is the major cause of your acne) so try to start it together.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Pills&amp;#34; have no effect cream works as well as any average wal mart cream wouldn&#x27;t spend money on it wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> So far seeing results one week in. Hoping to see the same amount of progress in another week and then more in a month</li>
    <li> A few months ago I noticed some little skin color bumps on my temples. They were very little and not very visible. But you could feel them. They made my skin feel like sandpaper. They weren&#x27;t zits either. Upon inspection they were just bumps with nothing in them. So I figured if I left them alone and took care of my skin as usual they&#x27;d go away. Nope. They started spreading down my jawline and onto my cheeks. They were still super small and skin colored and you couldn&#x27;t see them unless the light hit me at the right direction. But I was starting to get really self conscious. The whole lower portion of my face was sooo rough. So I started trying to just take better care of myself. I exercise and eat healthy anyway, but I started upping my game and taking really good care of myself. I added in a few supplements that were recommended, like fish oil. I made sure I was guzzling water. I went makeup free. I made sure not to touch my face. But, after having the bumps for at least four months, my skin erupted in a matter of days to full blown adult acne with deep painful cysts. It was so red and inflamed that a friend was convinced I had fallen and gouged my face on the ground. She wouldn&#x27;t believe that it was just acne because the day before when she&#x27;d seen me it wasn&#x27;t there. So I started looking for a product to help since just trying to be healthier wasn&#x27;t cutting it. Since then I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of soaps and masks and scrubs and acid peels and DIY cures. Some things don&#x27;t work at all. Some things seem like they are working only to stop. This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that is actually getting it under control. After only two days my skin was much less red and inflamed. It still has A LONG way to go to be cured. But it&#x27;s getting there slowly. I forgot to take this with me when I went to visit family for two days and in those two days my skin erupted again. Never again will I forget this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;The cream does make your skin VERY DRY and flaky. Be very very careful not to get it anywhere that doesn&#x27;t need it. I accidentally got it a little too low on my jaw line and it took days to get that healthy skin moisturized again. I was surprised at just how dry it made my healthy skin in one application! I also got it too close to my eyes one night because the bumps on my temples are close to that area. Ouch! Be as precise as possible when you&#x27;re applying. Also I read that most people apply this and let it sit for 15-20 min before applying a moisturizer. I found that applying the moisturizer spread this stuff around to place I didn&#x27;t want, no matter how long I let it sit and soak in. So I started applying the moisturizer first then the cream. It does help cut down on the drying, plus it doesn&#x27;t spread it around where you don&#x27;t want it. It might not be as effective, but for me it&#x27;s working much better. My skin is still improving when I do moisturizer first (lots of it!) then apply the benzoyl peroxide cream. I still have days where I look like a lizard shedding it&#x27;s skin (which can look even worse under makeup), but it&#x27;s much better than angry painful clusters of cysts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to experiment, but a good face scrub helps the skin shed quicker so it&#x27;s not quite as flaky. I&#x27;ve been using one from Mario Badescu that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or aggravate my sensitive inflamed face. Just be gentle with any scrub! And don&#x27;t use it too much, no matter how tempting!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the pills would help without the cream. I haven&#x27;t tried one without the other. Obviously I can see the difference the cream is making because it is so drying. But I don&#x27;t know if the pills would work on their own or not. Since I&#x27;m having so much luck with them together I don&#x27;t really want to risk experimenting. But if the cream is too harsh and makes it worse I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth trying just the pills! I mean, compare the price of this to a derm visit and it can&#x27;t hurt to at least try!not to get it anywhere that doesn&#x27;t need it.

    <li> I did not notice any improvement in acne, but only used it for 16 days.</li>
    <li> I am nearly finished with my first pack but I have already bought 2 new packs. I do not use the cream for purpose because I use dermalogica mediblanc skin treatment for my topical treatment. I must say these pill dont taste bad at all and since you get to chew them there is no issue of swallowing. I am an adult suffering with acne. It is now milder acne, that some cystic pimples may arise during menstruation time of month. I am suffering from hormonal outbreaks and scarring. I must say I have really seen an improvement in my skin since beginning this pill and my dermalogica routine. The pill seems to be holding down the breakouts because during my cycle, I only notice a very fine pimple and with the topical aid, it disappeared. For all the ladies suffering with acne as an adult I would say definitely try this and if you can afford dermalogica products, use them. I&#x27;ve been to many dermatologists that do nothing but play with your skin. If you can get a dermalogica microdermabrasion and acne facial...and see how your skin will be jump started to recover. then add this to your internal diet plus water, you will see great improvement.</li>
    <li> Since I am allergic to Benzyl Peroxide, I did not use the cream, so this is a review of the tablets only.&lt;br /&gt;I used the tablets religiously twice a day, in the morning and at night. No change in my acne at all. I really wanted it to work, but the truth is that it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Do not waste your money on this. Bought for my 12 year old. No improvement at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter who is having quite a problem with acne.  The first couple of weeks she did not notice a difference but then things kicked in and it has been helping considerably.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a college student and i have never really been plagued with breakouts. however, i tend to get beneath the skin breakouts that are not only painful, but IMPOSSIBLE to get rid of. I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks and i haven&#x27;t had one!  it&#x27;s worth a try, especially for the price</li>
    <li> Good morning. I have been off my BC pills for two months.  My plan was to take Nature&#x27;s Cure so I could stay off BC permanently.  I have oily skin and the type of acne that forms under the skin along the jawline.  My skin isn&#x27;t too bad but it is a far cry from how clear it was two months ago.  I started taking this product two weeks ago and I have been consistent.  I have seen no change as of yet.  I notice the cream dries my skin out, but I use a moisturizer to balance things out.  I started the second blister pack this morning.  If in two weeks I see no change in my skin, then I will not repurchase.  I feel like a month is a fair amount of time to see some change.  Good luck to all.</li>
    <li> The cream is a little too harsh on my skin but I love the pills. They cleared up my back that I have always struggled with.</li>
    <li> The acne cream works great and is very gentle to surrounding skin.  I wish it were easier to find in local stores, but I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  I also wish that it could be purchased without the tablets.  I do not take the tablets as I do not like to take supplements unless absolutely medically necessary.</li>
    <li> *Updated*  I&#x27;m afraid this product doesn&#x27;t work as well as when I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve stopped buying it.   I don&#x27;t believe in homeopathic medicine, because...science. But ever since I was a teenager this has been the best product for my acne. I haven&#x27;t fully resolved my hypocricy yet, though.</li>
    <li> My daughter has chronic acne.  She was not happy with the results. I had used the product years ago and had good results but my acne was not as bad as her&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed that the pills do anything really. The spot treatment does work though it is very drying so not such a great side effect!</li>
    <li> A blessing! Immediate results in just a couple days. This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to work for hormonal breakouts. I only need use the pills because when I use them I don&#x27;t need the cream at all. I used to feel depressed every time I looked in the mirror, now I am over joyed and can&#x27;t stop smiling!</li>
    <li> the zit zapper cream works! put it on at night and in the morning. that zit is pretty much gone.</li>
    <li> This treatment has being really efective.  My teenager girl was struggling with acne and tried lot of things, with no results.  These tablets are doing its work and the topic cream is the best she has ever had.</li>
    <li> Great product! My daughter has been using this for about a year and has continued to have clear skin. She loves it!</li>
    <li> 2/19/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken three days worth of the pills. On the 2nd day after taking a pill, by late morning I had a red face for a bit shortly after taking it but then it went away. Then on 3rd day- after the morning pill, I got a red face again, thought nothing of it since it again went away. So I went out for a long hike and the sun came out during my hike and I let my face get some sun but I got sun-burned pretty good &amp; thought that was weird since I wore a hat and etc. Also by early afternoon on 3rd day, I got a terrible headache which I thought was weird too because I ate breakfast and slept over 8 hours the night before. Then the headache turned into a migrane meaning a severe headache with nausea which made me lay down for a awhile that day. Then that night my eyes swelled up and turned red around my eyeball plus I had sunburn to boot. I still have a red face but it comes &amp; goes, with very swollen eyelids on the 4th day (morning time) but headache is finally gone. I did take a pill last night but won&#x27;t today. I am ALLERGIC to these pills but I&#x27;m not surprised since I have sensitive skin and have been allergic to certain vitmans (turmeric) and medications (sulfates, etc.) through-out my life. I do think it could work for someone else but I am sad to say I cannot use it anymore. Today my face is still affected (red face, swollen eyelids) but I am taking Benadryl to help with that which is working. I have not tried the cream but will spot treat with it like everyone else says to do. Also I cannot return items which is a negative but it was cheap enough to not matter really. Also I ordered it on-line with Walmart but it has not arrived yet and will be easy to return since I will not open it and they have an easy return method- I print-out their email about my order and walk-in to any Walmart store and return my unwanted items for full refund or get store credit- super easy.  I have heard great stuff about the spray so I may even just keep the un-used pills and give them to someone I know who may think they could use them safely meaning with no negative side effects and then I will just use the sprays since they got good reviews like the cream. Since its so cheap to buy losing 30 bucks on the pills but getting to use the cream &amp; two spray bottles- is still not a total loss. So in the end buy this on-line at WALMART since its cheaper and they allow you to return item and/or get store credit unlike AMAZON. Also if you have sensitive skin and are prone to being allergic to stuff stay away from these pills. For me they have negative side effects which are: Red Face, very sensitive to the sun which lead to sun burn &amp; very red around the eyes with very swollen eyelids and severe headache. But Good luck on the quest for clear, problem free skin.....</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT FOR MY ADULT ACNE</li>
    <li> I really like this brand of Acne treatment. I didn&#x27;t mind the pills but prefer the Nature&#x27;s Cure facial wash. I can never remember to take the little pills. The facial wash works just as good, if not better. Either way, this is a brand with great products.</li>
    <li> Ive Used These A Couple If Moths And They Do keep My face clear there for I&#x27;d recommend them !</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! My friend introduced me to this product about a year ago. She is always trying to use healthy and all natural products. Since this was cheap, and she claimed it worked well for her, I decided to give it a try. I am never going without this again! It truly works! Of course I still have acne, but not nearly as much as without this product. I have even stopped taking it for a few months to see what difference it makes on my skin and I definitely notice a difference and I quickly start taking it again to clear my skin. If your not sure about this product, give it a try! You wont regret it :) For new users however, it may be hard at first to remember to take this pill every morning and every night. Just leave the package out where you can always see it and it helps me remember. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have had acne since puberty and I am now 50.  I have visited several dermatologists through the years with some to no help with my skin.  Recently a friend recommended Nature&#x27;s Cure and like a lot of other products through the years, I said what the heck!  I tried it and saw immediate results!  only wish I had found it much sooner.  I would recommmend this product with no hesitation. It works and is very reasonably priced.  Thanks, Nature&#x27;s Cure!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Works wonders!! Definitely going to buy this stuff again and I will probably use it for the rest of my life! Love it!</li>
    <li> Before I used this, I had forehead acne, mostly due to hormones (I&#x27;m 18). They came up big and hurt a lot, but this actually helped it clear up! It didn&#x27;t really start working until the 3rd week, and now my skin is totally clear from those cystic pimples. I still have blackheads though, but those aren&#x27;t that bad. I have yet to use this during my period, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;ll help it or not. I recommend this to those who have tried everything from cleansers, to acne packs, but aren&#x27;t having any luck. Acne is really due to the fluctuations of your hormones, especially if you&#x27;re in your teenager years. This is pretty cheap. The only thing that stinks is the cream, because I don&#x27;t even use half of it, yet every month I will be getting a new tube.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t breakout other than one or two little zits a month. So when I broke out last year for a few months, it was unusual. This stuff is awesome! The cream can dry your face out a little but most do anyways. It literally cleared my breakouts. I&#x27;m back to normal and it&#x27;s been a year exact since I took the chewies. I still have one of the two chewies packs left. I just ran out of the cream two days ago (only need a little). I will be re buying just to have on hand. The homeopathic chewies really did the trick. They are tasteless also :)</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month ago based on the reviews and the price. I have mild acne, just looks worst because every time i have a break out it leaves a dark mark for months. I have definitely seen an improvement after taking this, but it hasn&#x27;t cleared me out completely,  i just get small pimples here and there. i have been getting less of the bigger more painful pimples though, I would definitely say for anyone to give it a shot, its a simple method and cheap too, you have nothing to lose! I&#x27;m happier with my skin now after I tried this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. As for the cream, I noticed a difference within 24 hours! The pimples were not completely gone, but they were noticeably reduced! It does tend to REALLY dry out your skin though. They weren&#x27;t kidding. I experienced some redness and peeling around my chin where my skin is extra sensitive, but I just used a moisturizer for a few days and it was back to normal!&lt;br /&gt;The anti-acne tablets work too, but they took longer to notice. You have to take them twice a day, once a day isn&#x27;t enough, I did that and my acne came back over night! So yeah, take it twice a day, I don&#x27;t know if chewing it first helps but it can&#x27;t hurt so I do that too before swallowing it all with water. It took me about a week to notice any difference. But that&#x27;s faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried! And my skin was smoother and less red than it has ever been by itself since I was a kid! I love this product! 5 stars! I will be buying more once I run out.</li>
    <li> I did not see that much progress. The pills make my acne prone skin look a little bit more clear but the lotion makes my skin to dry.</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Cure works for me. It is too bad the pills can&#x27;t be bought seperately, as I use very little of the topical product, and end up throwing most of it away.</li>
    <li> Effective and easy to take.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it worked for me at all. Did not take long to get to me at all. Would recommend this for people to try, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Love the pills but wish they came separately because the cream really dries out my face to wear I can&#x27;t use it. The cream is not good for my face but the pills seem to be working great! Get product and try the cream once a day first to see if it works for you. Would recommend pills but cream needs to have a moisturizer in it so it doesn&#x27;t dry face.</li>
    <li> The homeopathic pills seem to start working /I haven&#x27;t finished yet/. Am not sure about the cream&#x27;s effect, though...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that maybe one more month of treatment would be better - I&#x27;m gonna do it...</li>
    <li> I used this combo for about 2 months. I&#x27;m not entirely certain it works. There were some changes in my skin but the acne never completely went away and the cream does not seem to vanish my pimples as advertised.</li>
    <li> Absolutley love this stuff! It works well. Id recommend it to anyone with moderate acne. And It arrived sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> This is incredible find- worked after few days- I have real sensitive skin so I only used topical cream once a day- I love the way chewable pills packaged- I&#x27;m very forgetful- easy to check if I have already taken in morning</li>
    <li> MAYBE it&#x27;s a coincidence - but I suffered from painful acne for over three months.  The bumps were tenacious and seemed to come from nowhere - I am in my fifties and had not had troubles like these for over a decade.  I tried this and my face began clearing up within a week or two and was completely clear by the end of the month.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work for me . However ， I had no adverse effect.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders. My skinned Cleared up really well. But as any product my skin got used to the formula and sort of &amp;#34;rebelled&amp;#34;. I will be going back to this soon.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I used it years ago and I thought I should try it again. I just ordered 3 more months worth. I love my clear skin</li>
    <li> It helps to clear up skin it didn&#x27;t completely &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; it but it definitely helped.</li>
    <li> This product is great it helps with my cystic acne.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the spray. The pills left me feeling different but not in a bad way. I would recommend this product for each person will react differently to medication. I&#x27;m just a little uncertain but time will tell.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make any difference. HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t know if it didn&#x27;t work because my hormones are always REALLY f***d up because of the birth control pills and other medications I have to take everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always good to give it a try, price is not so bad and they shipping is fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M NOT SAYING IT&#x27;S NOT GONNA WORK FOR YOU, it might work, who knows!?, but it didn&#x27;t for me :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> I have a 10 year old daughter that has been battling acne for over a year. We have tried everything on her and it all made it worse! Thanks to all of the reviews on this product i decided to give it a try, i am so grateful that we did! Within 2 weeks of using this product her acne was totally cleared up! I highly recommend buying this product!</li>
    <li> I dont know but this product seems not working for me at all, Im almost done w it but Acne still keep growing. followed everything and directions,. this is not working for me.</li>
    <li> I did not see results until about 2 weeks of taking the tablets and along with the body spray and the creme provided. I spray in the morning because it dries faster than the creme dissolves,  and take the cream with me for added acne fighting power!!!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Ordered these because I have really been struggling with acne and it sucks started taking these it&#x27;s been a few days now so I&#x27;ll see what the results are and update my review</li>
    <li> It has been a month already and nothing worked. Pills didn&#x27;t work, cream didn&#x27;t work. At least not for me :(</li>
    <li> I liked this because it was easy 2in1, but if you pick up some Zink from the store, it works just as well! When I feel a pimple coming on I pop a few more zink and it never shows up. I got this 2times before I just switched to zink and tea tree oil for my face. This made my face REALLY itchy :/</li>
    <li> I wish i could give this 10 stars. The only product that deserves a rating like that.&lt;br /&gt;After Marena (IUD) I had terrible acne. Cystic. I&#x27;ve 30 and for the last 5 years I&#x27;ve tried everything to make it go away. Nothing has helped. NOTHING.  When I first started natures cure my acne got worse, but I didn&#x27;t freak out too bad because some reviews said that it would. After about 3 weeks my skin started to clear up and was about 99% clear in about 1.5 months.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months now and never break out. Not even on my period. Maybe one or two small zits, but nothing that bothers me.  10 STARS!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have moderate to severe acne this product is not for you. The best thing to do is go see a dermatologist! This product probably works best for people with minimal or occasional acne.&lt;br /&gt;If you struggle with moderate to severe acne like me, I suggest trying out these supplements such Burdock Root and Estroblock. Both products you can purchase on Amazon and they have done wonders for my face. Even better than the medicine that the dermatologist provided.</li>
    <li> I have had acne when I was a teenager of course I went to the doctor and got creams for it. I wish they had this 15 years ago. The teenager acne went away over the years and I never really had a problem with it again. I&#x27;m till about three months ago when my mother suddenly passed away. Flying overseas to see my family (we are a family and I am German) And all the stress and helping them with the funeral and everything ,plus the time difference, bad food -everything ..took it&#x27;s toll on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we got back about a couple of days later I got the bill my skin broke out like I have never seen it before. It was worse than when I was a teenager and I&#x27;m 30 years old.&lt;br /&gt;For as long as I can remember I have always I cleaned my face every day with \\&quot;clean&amp; clear \\&quot; facial cleaner and I put acne spot treatment on pimples that  just show up like everybody has them. Of course when I am close to getting my periode its worse. But I have never had it like this ! I had him on the temples of my head and my forehead and under my chin and on my jawbone. Also someone my cheeks, chest area and back..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband had tried out Proactive the year before and I have tried it sometimes on my skin . but I have to say it always dried my skin out and burned and didn&#x27;t really help. I sent it back and told them I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I have to outbreak I had no idea what to do . so I look on Amazon and read through a couple of things and I saw this and ordered it . because I thought I have nothing to loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I took it and within two weeks my skin cleared up and of course I changed my eating habits again to my normal diet plan. But this really really helped!! felt that the cream also made a big difference in that and if you follow with it it really changes something in your body. After another week my acne was pretty much gone. Even when I&#x27;m close or having my period My skin has less pimples than before! I didn&#x27;t even show any more than that iam on my periode!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin stays clear all month long and I will be reordering because I am done now with my 60 day pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen anything this effective and I like I said you should try it . for $13 you have nothing to lose but only to gain clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note :&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the \\&quot; clearzine\\&quot; u can buy on Amazon too and took that the first week as well additionally to the natures cure. I think it  made a big difference too but for the price it&#x27;s a little bit too expensive but like I said I was desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I bought the acne spray from natures plus for my back . Again for the price a little bit too expensive .&lt;br /&gt;I have to say you can also use any facial cleaner and rub down your neck if you have a partner or boyfriend to do it for you. If not the spray is perfect because you can use it on any angle.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter has been taking this product for at least 9 months and it has helped tremendously! She stopped for about a month earlier on and quickly realized how much it had been helping. She wouldn&#x27;t go without it now. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughter has seen a dramatic improvement since using the pills by nature&#x27;s cure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult and started suffering from adult acne for several months. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why so I cut out a lot of dairy in my diet and I was still breaking out. I was using regular facewash and it didn&#x27;t help much. So, I decided to try Nature&#x27;s Cure because I have a relative who tried it and it worked very well for him. I figure why not, it seemed affordable enough. I started taking the tablets and just after two weeks my face started clearing up. It started eliminating my breakouts, and the reddening of swelling of the acne. I was amazed. The vanishing cream was a bit too strong for my face, so I use adult acne cream by clearisil instead because it helps with adult&#x27;s sensitive skin. However, I can say that the tablets worked wonders for me. I don&#x27;t suffer breakouts everyday I used to. It also says you should chew the tablet for better results, which I do and chewing it is fine because the tablets doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor to it. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I tried this product and wanted to add to the reviews to let you all know it worked for me :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I swear by it.  I&#x27;ve had adult acne on and off my entire adult life and when it flares up, it&#x27;s far worse than my teenage acne EVER was.  Nature&#x27;s Cure reduces the number of flareups and dramatically reduces the severity of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one complaint and one suggestion to them:  the complaint is that it&#x27;s no longer available in brick and mortar stores anywhere I or anyone I know lives (5 states!), even though the website says it&#x27;s available in MANY stores.  The company has either pulled that distribution or instituted some policy that makes brick and mortar stores not want to deal with them anymore.  Whatever they did that made stores stop carrying it, they need to UNDO.  This ticks me off so badly that if there was any other alternative that actually worked and was price competitive, I&#x27;d go with it.  The suggestion is that they either offer an alternative of the tablets without the cream or reduce the size of the cream tube.  I have at least 30 of those tubes of cream now and I really don&#x27;t need any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this product for as long as they make it....and I hope that is forever!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now. I am 20, but I have had moderate acne since I was 16. I have tried so many different things to get rid of my acne. After spending so much money on over-the-counter salicylic acid washes and creams and Proactiv (PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money on that junk, it DOES NOT work!!!), I turned to a dermatologist. They gave me different prescriptions for a few things, including a wash that was $130 AFTER insurance. I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending so much money on clearing up my face. After tons of research, my boyfriend came across this and we ordered it on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with this, I am currently using Tea Tree Oil by Derma e and two different moisturizers (Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion, and Yes To Tomatoes Clear Skin Daily Balancing Moisturizer). I still have some red spots from past acne breakouts, but they are slowly fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this two-part system I was extremely disappointed. The benzoyl peroxide dried my skin out like I&#x27;ve never seen before. It was so dry for the first week and a half or so. It was painful and it was flaking off, making my dry skin a problem all on its own. When I added in the two different moisturizers I finally was able to control the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some others have said, this product WILL make your skin worse before it gets better. The chewable pills, which taste almost sweet, purge your skin of anything and everything nasty. I thought my skin was bad before I started this new regimen, but I had no idea of how much nasty gunk my skin was going to push out. I was so happy when it finally started getting better. I am still getting a few problem bumps, but they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as they used to and they are staying so much smaller than they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To recap: It will get worse before it gets better. The chewable pills do not taste bad at all. The benzoyl peroxide will dry out your skin, so look into the two different moisturizers I mentioned. Consider purchasing tea tree oil, as that has antibacterial properties that will help get everything out much more quickly. Have patience with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my brother, and will continue to recommend it to others. I am almost done with my first month, and I just purchased another three months worth of pills and vanishing cream. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better it gets!</li>
    <li> The product is extremely amazing.. It works for me after 1 week my pimples lessened and some blemishes were lightened by the ointment.. All you have to do is religiously do what the instruction in the box tells you then you can achieve the acne free face..</li>
    <li> A must have for my daughter&#x27;s acne. We have tried literally everything. She&#x27;s been using these for over a year and it keeps her pretty clear. Great product.</li>
    <li> My daughter swears by these and we have tried everything the dermatologist has to offer.  Using therein conjunction with prescribed meds keep my daughters skin clear.</li>
    <li> Need to try it more often for better results</li>
    <li> I did not see any results.</li>
    <li> Glad to have found this online when it was removed from my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped my skin appearance for years!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Nature&#x27;s Cure for about three weeks now and I think it really works!&lt;br /&gt;although I&#x27;m taking Roaccutane course now because I have cyctic acne. I don&#x27;t know whether the Roaccutane or Nature&#x27;s Cure pills are making improvement in my skin. but I can tell that the cream is working super great although it makes your face dry but I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is not sold in the stores anymore as far as I can tell.  I like it because the cream is not too strong, nor is it too gentle and the pills really work. I find I get less pimples, even during that time of the month, when I take them.</li>
    <li> Long time suffer of acne. I tried everything, all topical. this works! because it balances u from the inside then there is the cream for the acne u have now. but the pill stops acne from returning . by far my fav acne treatment. if the cream is to strong , just use ur  fav face wash.</li>
    <li> By the first week my face wasn&#x27;t oily and zits started to disappear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a pimple or two but not the pizza face I had before :)</li>
    <li> I am 15 and have bad acne trouble. I have not purchased this product yet, but could anyone who has used this product let me know if it still works even when I wear makeup?</li>
    <li> I love this product been using it for years.The only thing about this product is that it&#x27;s not mircle pill...I noticed when I drink alot of water with this product my skin is comptely clear :)</li>
    <li> it gave me headaches. i stopped taking it. only took it for a few days and did not see any difference.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical because I have tried everything and either it was just too time consuming, expensive or if you missed a day you broke out.  I suffer from adult acne and I was at my wits end.  My doctor told me that I can&#x27;t use the same stuff as my teenage daughter uses because I am an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works.  I have been using it a week and my skin is clear.  I am hoping it is this doing it because it is amazing.  The cream will dry you out a bit so use it once a day and work up to two times a day.  You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it either.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either.  Much more affordable than proactiv.  I wish they sold it in San Antonio but they don&#x27;t.  The pills don&#x27;t really taste like anything so they are easy to chew and let dissolve on my tongue.</li>
    <li> This was sent with defective packaging and missing the cream. I went ahead and used the tablets. They weren&#x27;t unpleasant but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> Seems to have helped very quickly. 4 stars as the cream does make your face very very dry for a short time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Made my acne worse. Save your money, wish I would have saved mine. Highly disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is the only topical treatment cream that actually works! Walmart used to sell it but now you can&#x27;t find it anywhere. I usually just throw the pills away though... I don&#x27;t need any chemical messing with my hormones.</li>
    <li> OK, ladies and gents, first off... FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. There is a reason manufacturers give them; for BEST results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1, Day 3:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my skin: I have combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;My acne issue: Mostly T-Zone, chin, chest &amp; back.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have really oily skin, but when it does happen it is mostly my t-zone. Also, my pores are outrageous, no peel nor scrub would do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the acne that was previously there is all dried up, and no new bumps have shown up. My pores are half the size they were before use. Even my boyfriend mentioned he&#x27;d noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER: everyone has different skin, just because this has worked extremely fast for me doesn&#x27;t mean it will for you. So keep with it and, again, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pills: Seriously, chew the tabs until it is completely dissolved in your spit. Yeah I know it&#x27;s not appealing, but DO IT. They do not taste bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;The Cream: It has the ingredient PEROXIDE.. I like to use a cotton swab or a Q-tip to put it on the problem areas. If there is a spot on your face not affected by acne, you do NOT need to put this cream on that part of your skin. You only need to put the cream on the actual acne or black heads. This substance WILL dry your skin out, so make sure you use a good moisturizer. For me, I like the brand KISS MY FACE, I use the aromatherapy with lavender. If you have oily skin, try something that is oil free with aloe. Aloe is very good for your skin, it will not only even out your color but moisture balance too.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and didn&#x27;t understand the importance of moisturizer, this stuff will make you see that it&#x27;s a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after you spot apply the cream, give it a good 10-20 minutes to soak in. Keep in mind that you don&#x27;t have to glob it on, blend it on the area until you can&#x27;t see the milky-white color on your skin. As for your moisturizer, you don&#x27;t need to glob that on either, take a dime sized amount and rub it together in your palms (of clean hands) and apply to your face and neck. Also, blend this in until it is clear on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: FOLLOW DIRECTIONS. and if you have tried this for a good month and it still didn&#x27;t work for you, seriously go see a dermatologist. Most people don&#x27;t understand that acne can not only be caused by diet, lack of exercise, stress, hormone imbalance as well as genetics, so stronger medication may be in order. (I will follow up soon)</li>
    <li> This product reduced my acne by about 75% after two full months of use, but it never completely cleared it even after 4+ months.  However, this company&#x27;s other main product, the BODY SPRAY, did clear me up totally when used on my face (and body), after only about 2 weeks of use, and has kept me clear for over 2 months!</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 2 years ago and have not stopped. Previously, I was the victim of moderate annoying acne. After I began taking the chewable, tasteless pills twice a day and using the cream once a day, I noticed that within 2 weeks, my skin was clearing up. It even helped with dark spots and scars! Now, two years later, I still depend on this product to get me through. I don&#x27;t take the pills as much now, but I do use the cream every night. It is an amazing product! I definitly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I tried this and into the first 2 and a half weeks, most of my acne cleared up.  Then my face slowly started to get red and itching  lot.  When the redness kept on increasing I stopped.  In the time since then the redness has disappeared.</li>
    <li> I started taking birth control pills after being off them for years. I&#x27;ve never had bad skin but since I&#x27;m now in my late 30&#x27;s and the introduction of the hormones again, I started breaking out horribly. I started using proactive and other skin regimens but nothing was working.  I found this product and based on reviews decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve used the first pack of pills and haven&#x27;t really used the cream, but it seems to be clearing up my skin.  Since this all started from the hormones I figured I needed to fight this from the inside out.  The pills seem to do the trick.</li>
    <li> Only product that has helped me with my hormonal acne</li>
    <li> My daughter has had trouble with acne and we have tried all kinds of treatments. Natures cure is the only treatment that has worked for her</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time, and it works well for me. It is convenient to order on Amazon and receive it before running out!</li>
    <li> I will up the rating to 5 if the results are lasting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wanted to wait a full month before making a review. A lot of the reviews indicate that they saw results overnight and within 2 weeks. I didn&#x27;t believe that at all. I think a realistic review is one where the product has at least one to two months to digest in your system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it has not been an overnight success story. I still got breakouts... Hell, I still get a bump or two. But as soon as I feel it coming, I put on some of the BP cream and by the next morning, it&#x27;s pretty much dried up! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s working best, the pill or the BP. I love this product, though. It def has reduced the cysts I use to get and dries up any sudden pop ups instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine is to wash with Morning Burst face wash and dab a little of the BP cream if I have an active pimple. Then I let it dry for about a min or two, and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening, I use panoxyl and then dba a bit of the BP. A little goes a long way, trust me. Do not over do it. Make sure to moisturize too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a good month before giving up! My skin looks drastically different! Mostly, all I have right now is acne scars. I feel so much more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think the BP cream is the most effective part. I have not had any side effects from the pills either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know how disabling acne can be. Please let me know if you have any questions!!!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly this has been a life saver. I have tried everything from retin a to proactive to various drugstore products. I have struggled with acne for 5 years. This was the cure!! I have been using this for three months and I swear by it now. It has helped me feel so much better about myself. I had severe acne not cystic but lots of pimples all over my face. This helped me so much. I have one or two pimples here and there rarely though. And now its just scars and redness. I love this product. Only downside is if i apply even a little bit to much my eyes start to water. But no problem for me because it clears up my acne too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product in combination with other Nature&#x27;s Cure products and so fate I&#x27;m happy with the result. I have combination skin and this, I believe, is helping. However I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the pills, or the other stuff I&#x27;m using. HOWEVER, I really do like the cream it comes with. It dries my skin up and feels like it&#x27;s working. I use it in conjunction with the moisturizing cream under the same brand. I know drying skin up might not be a plus for some people, but I get tired of having overly-oily skin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why you can&#x27;t easily get this at drugstores anymore, because it is the greatest thing for clearing acne! Especially Hormonal Acne!</li>
    <li> i made the mistake of trying a bunch of new products at once so i dont know if this actually was helping my acne or if it was the coconut oil i started using but the pills didnt taste gross, it was a very simple product to use</li>
    <li> Just as described.  This product is helping my daughter&#x27;s acne.  Her face is not perfectly clear but it is noticeably better than before.</li>
    <li> This really does work!! So happy to have found it!! Great product and service!! glad I read the other reviews and tried it myself!!</li>
    <li> While some say it worked for them, after 30 days, I saw no difference and actually developed more acne. I was hoping something natural that worked internally would be the answer, but guess I&#x27;ll continue using topical solutions</li>
    <li> This stuff is UH-MAZE-ING. BUY IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I will summarize this entire review in this simple sentence. Nature&#x27;s Cure didn&#x27;t make my skin 100% PERFECT, but it did make it 99% PERFECT!!! SO WORTH IT! Works better than ANYTHING else I&#x27;ve tried!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is important for you to know that if you want to try this product, you should buy two of them at first!!! Like many \\&quot;medicines\\&quot; this takes a couple weeks to really get into your body and start working its magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Two Weeks-I began to see the blemishes I did have clearing up a lot faster than they normally do. I have never really used the gel that comes with the pills, except during these first two weeks I would put a thin layer on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the First Month- I wanted to say I saw a dramatic change in my skin, but I wasn&#x27;t sure yet if this was just my skin&#x27;s normal cycle of clearing up before it came \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot; again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Month &amp; Beyond- This stuff REALLY works!!! I will still get the very occasional zit, but they are HARDLY noticeable. Even when it comes to the week before my period, I will maybe get one small teeny tiny cyst (if that!) that is hardly even noticeable, whereas my chin would have a number of zits every time I had my period before Nature&#x27;s Cure. Before Nature&#x27;s Cure, my hormone influenced zits would take until the next month to heal, by which point I would get a new breakout! (Talk about frustrating!!) Not only has Nature&#x27;s Cure made my skin DRASTICALLY better, the very occasional, tiny zits I do get heal like THAT! (Imagine I snapped my fingers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should maybe mention that before Nature&#x27;s Cure (and in addition to Nature&#x27;s Cure still) I am using Clean and Clear Continuous Control Cleanser, just in the mornings to clean off any bad bacteria. Even with this product I was still having my troublesome skin, though.</li>
    <li> My skin has always been pretty clear, but about 3 months ago i started getting deep cystic acne bumps that came out of no where. The whole left side of my face had about 6 deep huge pimples on it at one time, it looked terrible! I could not get rid of them and they hurt so bad. Ive always used face wash and an exfoliator and then benzoyle peroxide (10%) at night. So when I started getting these pimples I knew it had to have been hormonal cause ive always had pretty good skin. Now, let me say that this system is not an overnight fix to acne. I&#x27;ve been taking this product faithfully (one pill in the morning and one at night before bed) for 2 weeks straight now, and I have seen a pretty good improvement in the scars left by these pimples. In saying that, even a week after being on the pills I was still getting a few cystic bumps, however now, 2 weeks into it, I can see that I am getting less and less and my skin is looking a whole lot clearer! I also use the BP cream that comes in the kit its 5%, and I put it on under my makeup in the mornings. I just started doing this recently, but I feel like it fights pimples having it under my makeup during the day. The cream is a little drying, so I put alot of moisturizer over the cream and then put on my makeup. Im really glad they came up with this system!! I really believe it works. But again, its not an overnight fix. it will take anywhere from 2 weeks to a month to see any improvment, but it is WORTH the wait. I hope it works for everyone else struggling with acne.</li>
    <li> Just like you, I have tried almost every acne system out there. I&#x27;m 20 years old and I recently have been getting worse acne than I ever had before. Was it severe? No. But it still made me self-conscious and was really frustrating. I couldn&#x27;t get anything to clear it up, I almost considered going back to products like ProActiv, which had done nothing and really dried my skin out, thinking that maybe I just hadn&#x27;t used the system right. I decided to buy this because it was cheap and I was pretty much willing to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it worked. I have been using it for maybe 2 or 3 weeks and I&#x27;m loving it. I still have gotten small bumps here or there but I barely even notice them so I know no one else probably is either. The Vanishing Cream IS very strong, so use it delicately. It does have strong drying powers, but it does it&#x27;s job wonderfully. Just don&#x27;t use to much of it and get good lotion for your face!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to order a 3-month supply of this product now that I&#x27;ve tested it out!&lt;br /&gt;Try it! What have you got to lose besides acne?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s and my acne started getting worse a couple of years ago. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now (just reordered it) and the pills have almost completely cleared up the acne on my back. I still have blemishes on my face but they seem to go away quickly with the cream. I recommend this product to anyone with stubborn adult acne.</li>
    <li> I have had cystic acne for over thirty years.I have tried everything and this is the only product that has worked for me. I have been using it for about eight years. Occasionally I will stop using it but then the acne always comes back. This did not work for my daughter, but It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> this product is helping  control my acne, I haven&#x27;t had one single pimple for 3 weeks now. i reccomend this to anyone with mild acne or to someone who has a mixture of mild acne and cystic acne.</li>
    <li> This product changed my life. I have now been using it for about 10 years, and these tablets were the ONLY thing that cleared up my acne. (I has bad acne as a teenager and began getting cystic acne as an adult.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking it for almost 1mo and I do think it&#x27;s helping. I&#x27;m still having breakouts, so I feel like I should give it 1 more month to decide for sure.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately didn&#x27;t read the description close enough as I bought the female version instead of the male version.  I didn&#x27;t use the pills but did use the BP and love it.  It is the best BP I&#x27;ve used and cleared me up quickly.</li>
    <li> I will admit -- I do feel this product was helping reduce my acne. However, I developed a really nasty yeast infection about two weeks in (sorry to be gross but want to give an honest review) and I also noticed a weird stinging sensation in my lower abdomen. I did some online searching and noticed some people say they develop gastro issues with this product. I didn&#x27;t add anything else new to my routine and haven&#x27;t had a yeast infection in years. May be totally un-related but once I stopped the product, my stomach issues stopped. I think this is a good product, but for me, the side effects were not worth it.</li>
    <li> I noticed a differences after a few days of use and if I go more than a week without it my skin starts breaking out again.</li>
    <li> As a women in her 50&#x27;s I love the cream for the occasional chin breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product is just, amazing! After one month of use -- my skin is a lot smoother and a lot less prone to blemishes. People are now asking ME what products I use because of my nice skin. The tablet is easy to chew, kind of reminds me of the candy Smarties, and I wish I had used this product sooner! I honestly just love it :)</li>
    <li> These pills actually work.  At first, I was taking them as instructed, but they didn&#x27;t seem to help THAT much.  About a month ago, I started taking two at a time (so four a day), and my acne is almost completely gone.  It&#x27;s a lot to take, but I have tried too many things that did not work.  This really does.  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I have a hormone imbalance and tend to get acne and a lot of oil production, I take this along with spironolactone, but ever since I started taking this along side with the spironolactone I have noticed a big difference, the bp/aloe vera cream is exactly what I needed not top drying! will continue to order</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have only been using this for 2 weeks. I still get bad acne here and there but not as much as i did before I started taking Nature&#x27;s Cure Two part Acne Treatment. I have used many other products before but I would say this one worked the best. I would recommend others to try this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s literally only been two days since I started this regimen and I&#x27;m already seeing my face clear up! I&#x27;m so excited I keep touching my face (and I need to stop) I&#x27;ve been struggling with hormonal acne since I left college and I get cystic acne across my cheeks and jawline. I absolutely need to wear makeup because of the redness and discoloration from past acne so I use bare minerals concealer and that&#x27;s supposed to help clear my acne too. absolutely nothing topical has helped me. I&#x27;ve tried Origins, Lancome, First Aid Beauty and anything else you can think of from Sephora. I even cut milk from my diet and drank loads more water and reduced my junk food intake! NOTHING! I was getting desperate and being on Microgestin didn&#x27;t even help all to much either.&lt;br /&gt;One day I just had some money left over from shopping and I just happen to come across Natures Cure. I&#x27;ve never heard of it before but THANK COSMOS I FOUND IT. The pills don&#x27;t taste like anything and I don&#x27;t mind chewing it into oblivion. The cream, however, irritates my eyes and makes them water. I&#x27;ll bear it for the results, though. My skin gets really tight after putting on the cream so following the BP I put a littIe dab of Josie Maran&#x27;s light argan oil (since I already have oily combination skin) around the areas I put the cream. I&#x27;m seeing promising results very early and it&#x27;s almost too good to be true. I&#x27;ll keep updating as I continue</li>
    <li> Didnt do anything for my hormonal cystic acne</li>
    <li> Wow - only a few days in and I&#x27;m amazed! I&#x27;ve dealt with acne, uneven skin tone, enlarged pores and oily skin since I was a teen (50-odd years ago!). This is the first product that has ever eliminated the oil slick AND seems to have shrunk my pores at least a bit. I will update as time goes on, but right now, this senior citizen is one happy camper!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost a month, and I&#x27;ve seen a little improvement, but it&#x27;s definitely a start, I&#x27;ll keep everyone updated to see if it&#x27;s worth it after one more month.</li>
    <li> I used this once in high school, and after three weeks reminded myself why I never repurchased.  I just don&#x27;t see it doing anything and I did not miss a pill.  The cream was ok, but not worth $11 to purchase.</li>
    <li> I should had researched some of the ingredients in the pills. It contains some arsenic which will cause you to have headaches. It also has some ingredients which is given for women for menopause to control hormones wish I would had done my homework before I bought them.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this for 2 weeks, my acne got horribly worse, like huge hormonal cycts all over. I thought I had acne before but this severly accelerated it. I hear there is a purging phase but I couldnt make it though it. I felt gross.</li>
    <li> got this product to help with breakouts and it has actually made my face worse.  followed directions and gave it a month to work with no results.  wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I have tried every treatment including rx available. I always come back to benzoyl peroxide products...only thing that works for me. Get 5 percent, 10 if u can find it. Not for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Really works good for me</li>
    <li> My face has shown immense improvement in just the 3 days since I bought it. I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews and decided to buy it. After months of going to the dermatologist trying to repair what proactiv did to my face...This is the only thing that has worked so far!  hopeful for the next few weeks!</li>
    <li> I suddenly started this year having horrible deep acne that would not go away (perimenopausal I&#x27;m sure). I just started this product earlier this week and the stubborn red bumps decreased, the white heads are gone, blackheads decreased. I&#x27;ve been using the lotion 2 times a day with no drying but I have a very oily T zone. No allergic reactions so far, which I was worried about since it&#x27;s a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product. Other reviewers said results took longer so I will edit in the future as things progress.&lt;br /&gt;---April 3, 2013--- Still doing very well with this product. It has actually made my cheeks a bit dry but t zone still a bit oily. No other side effects that I can tell. I actually now take the pills only once a day and use the cream only as needed. If I have a big painful pimple coming in I take an extra pill and pat on the cream and it clears up in 24 hours. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I am 25 and have always had trouble with acne. Not too bad. But I tend to pick to make them worst. I started noticing it was always around my time of the month making them hormonal. . These have worked wonder for me! I have stocked up</li>
    <li> It works but you need to use it constantley and be patient. You will see results in about 6 weeks, so be patient.</li>
    <li> I will say, this did clear my acne up some. I don&#x27;t have as much break outs anymore. Still few though. I do love how easy it is to take these pills, since they are chewable. Not a bad taste at all either! By far, this is the best over the counter acne treatment product I have tried! I have tried several different kinds including proactiv, and nothing compares to this!</li>
    <li> Works nicely... Great pricing too! I am very thankful that I purchased this item and have been using it. I also found that toothpaste is a great face wash for poors and acne!</li>
    <li> My g/f loves this stuff. She just got a 3mo supply.</li>
    <li> I have seen great results using these pills. I am allergic to the benzoyl peroxide in the cream so I can&#x27;t use it. I only wish they sold the pills on their own It feels like a waste for someone like myself that is allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent timing for the delivery of the product. Nothing was wrong whatsoever, I will definitely order it again. The product works pretty well in my opinion as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 yrs, &amp; the only time I stopped taking it was due to being pregnant, &amp; boy did I break out bad, I also notice if I go two weeks without it I start seeing pimples. I LOVE t his product &amp; would recommend it to anyone who has bad acne, &amp; think it&#x27;s due to hormones. I know mine was, because when I took Orthotrycyclen birth control pills I didn&#x27;t have acne, &amp; that birth control pill helps acne. I HOPE THIS NEVER GOES OFF THE MARKET!!</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. I have had moderate acne 5+ years now and have tried almost everything to demolish this torture. Reading all of the prior &#x27;positive&#x27; reviews made me wnat to try this for myself. By the time I completed the first pack, my acne stopped! My skin was smooth again finally! I did stop taking the meds at that point, for about a month, but little by little, I noticed the break outs coming back. I now started into my 2nd pack, and im definitely ordering a continuation a.s.a.p! If I find I need to take this indefinitely, I am ok with that. Simply because I have finally found something simple that works!</li>
    <li> My teen has tried everything and this seems to be doing the job after two weeks of use! Her scars seem to be fading also.</li>
    <li> Made my acne worse. :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffered from acne for more than a decade since my teenage and it became worse in recent year. I&#x27;ve tried almost every acne healing products and nothing worked. This product did an amazing work! my cystis acne vanished within a month! I&#x27;ll definely keep using this product and hoping it can clear the blemish on my face.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products, including medication but this is the only product that so far has been able to control my acne. I recomended. It takes 4 weeks to take full effect but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I am 47 and have perimenopausal acne: I didn&#x27;t have acne as a kid or young adult, now I do.  Arrrgh!  This product has made a big difference! The cream that comes with it works very well; it clears up acne and gets rid it of pretty quick...</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my acne...Used it for 2 months,The pills are surger pills..Don&#x27;t wast your money on this item&lt;br /&gt;Do your homework first...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female that gets hormonal acne...the kind of massive cyst that lasts 2-3 weeks!  I started using Nature&#x27;s Cure about 2 years ago because I was desperate.  Well, within a couple of months, I really noticed a difference!  The pills are amazing.  They really cut down on the cystic acne I get, and the cream that is included is great too.  I feel it&#x27;s not as harsh as some other benzoyl peroxide creams, because it doesn&#x27;t dry me out as badly (but if you use it regularly, use a moisturizer or jojoba oil 15 minutes after applying the cream so that your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out).  Used in combination, my skin is clear!  I got lazy and stopped using this for a about 3 months, thinking my skin was going to stay clear, but my cysts came back, so this really is the thing that is helping me.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced and I have a *very* sensitive stomach, and the pills have not upset my tummy at all.  Overall, a wonderful product to try, just give it about 3 months to fully see results.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. 😟</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne for the longest time and I&#x27;ve just about tried everything to clear it! I was looking for something new and came across this item and decided to give it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised. At first, I didn&#x27;t see any results but after a week or two my acne started clearing up and you could see changes in my skin! I have found that chewing the tablets work better than just swallowing it whole. At first you break out to clear all the dirt from your skin, but just be consistent with it and you&#x27;ll see results!</li>
