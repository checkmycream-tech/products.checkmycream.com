      <li>I really liked this product...</li>
      <li>This used in moderation gives nice hold.</li>
      <li>This product also smells GREAT which is a major plus :) Very easy product to use and is an excellent value!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a great mousse type product and really moisturizes my hair, with a nice fragrance too.</li>
      <li>has a wonderful scent whereas this smells completely different and not as appealing.</li>
      <li>This is important because I&#x27;m in Washington D.C. with all the humidity!</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Dries okay, but takes a while.  </li>
      <li>Sebastian Whip Cream really works great</li>
      <li>Hope to use this product for many years</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Such an amazing product!!!  </li>
      <li>Sebastian&#x27;s whipped cream is exactly what I was looking for in my life!!!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair smooth and it holds the curly much better.  </li>
      <li>Unlike many similar hair creams and gels, this one DID NOT leave my hair feeling &amp;#34;dried-out&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; I honestly believe this product is very innovative and unique (for all hair types).  </li>
      <li>The product works fine, so I&#x27;ll use it but won&#x27;t purchase it again online.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair so any product I use</li>
      <li>best stuff ever, love it, leave hair so soft and flexible would recommend this product to anyone that is willing to pay a little more for a good product</li>
      <li>This paticular \\&quot;WHIPPED CREAM MOUSSE\\&quot; has a light conditioner in it.</li>
      <li>Worked great when my stylist used it at the salon, but when I bought it online and tried to use it, it just wasn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
      <li>Thank you \\&quot;SABASTIAN FOR MAKING SUCH GREAT HAIR PRODUCTS.\\</li>
      <li>The price is good though and so far it works well.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser originally recommended and used this on my hair.</li>
      <li>The product itself is very easy to use, smells nice, and most importantly did not make my hair feel or look greasy or heavy.</li>
      <li>The salon used a special perm formula so my hair would not burn during the perm process.</li>
      <li>But the bottle and push pump top leave much to be desired.  </li>
      <li>This makes my curls nice and soft and removes the frizz.</li>
      <li>I have short hair, so it seems like I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it, which is good.</li>
      <li>I love this and am amazed on how much money I now save..  </li>
      <li>Seriously the best product out there for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Mild ingredients.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Especially love that it actually looks like whipped cream :)</li>
      <li>Keeps it calm in the most intense humidity.  </li>
      <li>I have super short hair and love this stuff, can be a bit greesy if you use too much though, probably not the best for long hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make sure you play with how much product to use on your hair before giving up on it if you don&#x27;t see the results you want at first.  </li>
      <li>The best way to let your natural hair down.</li>
      <li>Great for little girls also.</li>
      <li>so I even get good hair the second day without too much fuss.  </li>
      <li>This is by far one of my top three fav products from the Sebastian line</li>
      <li>Love how it leaves my hair...always soft curls.  </li>
      <li>(It is particularly good for curly hair the second day after washing as it does not have a lot of hold but revives &amp; shapes very well.</li>
      <li>Worked great for the first few weeks of use.</li>
      <li>very creamy,hair is not stiff like most mousse products.</li>
      <li>I was given that tip at a hair salon where I bought my first bottle.</li>
      <li>Excellent product and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
      <li>Almost instantly I fell in love with the whipped cream as I put it in</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it now!  </li>
      <li>This product is great for thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>I assumed a product of this quality and price would last longer and be better.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s pretty sticky.  </li>
      <li>I used a sample and instantly fell in love.</li>
      <li>This was my first time ordering this product</li>
      <li>First of all, the foam comes out</li>
      <li>my hair is still full of body and very soft.</li>
      <li>Provides conditioning and volume in a unique non- sticky product with soft volume.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for my straight, thick, coarse hair!</li>
      <li>So it was only right to order a bottle for my own personal use.</li>
      <li>It was perfect for my long thick hair.</li>
      <li>For this kind of dispenser, you really do have to shake well, with the can upside down.</li>
      <li>Similar to the consistency of a mousse (light and airy), this whipped cream provided intense moisture and shine.</li>
      <li>It is also VERY</li>
      <li>and I was very irritated it was packed in a box with nothing but paper</li>
      <li>And there has been times I put too much on accidentally and</li>
      <li>I have combo hair, some is wavy and some is very curly and course.  </li>
      <li>, no matter how much you shake it (I ordered this three times online, so I can&#x27;t chalk it up to a malfunction in the can).  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much though esp at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was also packaged in a way that didn&#x27;t protect the cans very well.</li>
      <li>and I am very amazed by the results.</li>
      <li>Is what I do when I use the conditioner, I take a medium size tooth comb and comb it through my hair so it will make is much easier for me to comb my hair out after conditoning it and using the \\&quot;WHIPPED CREAM MOUSSE.\\</li>
      <li>where I live, we get very high humidity</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used a sample and instantly fell in love. So it was only right to order a bottle for my own personal use. When you have fine hair such as myself you definitely dont want mousse that weighs down the hair. Smells good too</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hair product for curls.  I love this and am amazed on how much money I now save..  One problem is it lacks air pressure way too soon. It still works however does not have that soft texture when you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> best stuff ever, love it, leave hair so soft and flexible would recommend this product to anyone that is willing to pay a little more for a good product</li>
    <li> Seriously the best product out there for my hair.  Keeps it calm in the most intense humidity.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Have used this for over five years. I have naturally curly hair and always have a hard time finding something that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or look &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and crunchy. This used in moderation gives nice hold. And I like the sent of it as well.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to be on the frizzy side. Anyone who has had to go through the trying to deal with naturally curly hair that is frizzy knows my pain. I have tried almost everything on the market and then I saw these Sebastian kit on sale at Ulta. Almost instantly I fell in love with the whipped cream as I put it in and it gave me bounced and No FrizzIes. elated is the closest word in the English language I can come to describe it.</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first few weeks of use. However, then the puffiness isn&#x27;t as stiff and it&#x27;s liquidy. I assumed a product of this quality and price would last longer and be better.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking stiff at all. my hair is still full of body and very soft.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this product at Ulta and instantly fell in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders for my dry, frizzy curly hair. (It is particularly good for curly hair the second day after washing as it does not have a lot of hold but revives &amp; shapes very well. It is also VERY moisturizing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I am Caucasian with large, frizzy curls and dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> I have also bought this product locally, and the price is comparable. It&#x27;s a great mousse type product and really moisturizes my hair, with a nice fragrance too. I don&#x27;t use it all of the time because I think it builds up and can flatten your hair if used too often. The dispenser can be finicky, a small shot dispenses a lot.</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product!!!  Love how it leaves my hair...always soft curls.  This seller offered a VERY fair price for a high quality product!!!</li>
    <li> Having curly and also permed hair, this product has been a very welcome surprise.  It squirts out like whipped topping and leaves my hair curly but never crunchy or dried out.  It provides enough hold when I need it.  Your can also re-vamp your hair later in the day with a water bottle spray.</li>
    <li> Not so great. Did not come out of the can as it should and after a week, the nozzle stopped working</li>
    <li> The Sebastian Whipped cream gives body with out making your hair feel heavy or oily. Hope to use this product for many years</li>
    <li> I love this product.  And there has been times I put too much on accidentally and it didn&#x27;t effect the outcome of my hair.  Gives my hair just enough body.  Try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my straight, thick, coarse hair! One application after I get out of the shower and I have no problems combing through it.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my top three fav products from the Sebastian line and I was very irritated it was packed in a box with nothing but paper and there was no lid on the bottle and some of it spilled out of the nozzle.</li>
    <li> I continue to buy this product online. Love it. Put some in my wet hair and go. Hair dries curly and NO stickiness! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Perfect product for curly and wavy hair. Wear your curls without having them hard and stiff. Smells great and also conditions your hair. Great for little girls also. Style their hair without those harmful products. The best way to let your natural hair down.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter with naturally curly hair.  When she first tried it, she hated it, and said it made her hair look like a mop.  However, she tried it again using more product, and that was the trick!  She absolutely loves it now!  I have noticed how soft and defined her curls are now.  Her hair was always beautiful, but now it is drop-dead gorgeous!  Make sure you play with how much product to use on your hair before giving up on it if you don&#x27;t see the results you want at first.  She says this is the best product she has every tried on her curly hair to keep it frizz-free and manageable.</li>
    <li> Looks just like whipped cream, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and stiff.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere local so I am happy to order it online and save some $$$$</li>
    <li> I have been looking so long for a mousse that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy. I finally found it! I have slightly wavy hair and this product makes the waves look smooth and soft. Even if I just put the product in and leave it...no crunch and just soft waves. The smell is nice and subtle.</li>
    <li> This is a creamy foam mousse that used to smell like coconuts but now does not. I don&#x27;t know what changed but that alone is disappointing. The price is good though and so far it works well.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser originally recommended and used this on my hair. I did not initially purchase because of the price but ended up buying it a week later when I could not get it out of my head how well this product works!  I have fine hair so any product I use tends to just weigh my hair down, yet I want conditioning and volume - what is a girl to do?  Well, look no further than Sebastion Whipped Cream! Provides conditioning and volume in a unique non- sticky product with soft volume. Provides volume to my hair even in the most humid conditions!</li>
    <li> I would of rated this higher however this is different than what I&#x27;ve been purchasing at Ulta. I compared the two products and the one I purchased at Ulta has a wonderful scent whereas this smells completely different and not as appealing. The product works fine, so I&#x27;ll use it but won&#x27;t purchase it again online.</li>
    <li> This is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever had!!! Just one issue...&lt;br /&gt;The problem I had is that within a few times using it, the product won&#x27;t dispense like it&#x27;s suppose to, or not even at all. This stuff is not cheap and I would expect it to work/dispense as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too late to return so I&#x27;m just out the money. This experience will make me reconsider purchasing similar items.</li>
    <li> This product smells different than the one I buy locally. It smells like a Pantene product, could be a varied fragrance for a different market.</li>
    <li> For those reviewers who had trouble getting all the product out of the container: You have to look at the directions. For this kind of dispenser, you really do have to shake well, with the can upside down. I shake 20-40 shakes, until I feel the contents moving inside. Then you must dispense it into the palm of your hand, with the container upside down. Mild ingredients. Works well for my curly hair. Controls frizz.</li>
    <li> Worked great when my stylist used it at the salon, but when I bought it online and tried to use it, it just wasn&#x27;t the same.  First of all, the foam comes out all runny, no matter how much you shake it (I ordered this three times online, so I can&#x27;t chalk it up to a malfunction in the can).  Also, it&#x27;s pretty sticky.  Dries okay, but takes a while.  Not the best.</li>
    <li> I have combo hair, some is wavy and some is very curly and course.  My stylist is always telling me I have damage, in those areas until I brought her pictures of me at 11 with the same hair, then she realized it is just the way my hair grows. She had me try this and I thought no way this will work, but wow it does!! This makes my curls nice and soft and removes the frizz.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on a blog and the review was so great and the bloggers hair looked so good I just had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this &amp;#34;whipped cream&amp;#34; exceeded my expectations. I was my hair in the evening and let it dry overnight. I apply a small ball of &amp;#34;whipped cream&amp;#34; to the crown of my hair for body and control and then smooth it through the rest of my hair. When I wake up it requires minimal styling, I just use a blow dry brush to smooth everything out (maybe 5 minutes) and I&#x27;m good to go. The cream gives my hair just the amount of body I need and it also adds a layer of conditioning that provides smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve even been giving it away as gifts.</li>
    <li> Sebastian Whip Cream really works great I love it!  Make&#x27;s hair smooth not fly away hair.  I would have given it 5 star but I have one complaint.  Too much cream comes out the spout, I must throw half of it away or it will make my hait too soft and flat.</li>
    <li> Sebastian whipped cream is just great for hair styling.  Very easy to use and makes my hair stay in place with a great shine.</li>
    <li> This product is great for thick curly hair. I feel like it would be too heavy for straight hair or fine hair. The product is literally just like a whip cream bottle. The cream feels thick though it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all. I usually put some in my palm, rub my hands together, then evenly distribute it through my damp hair. It helps my curls hold their shape and gives them some extra bounce without any stickiness. Make sure to scrunch your hair when you put it in because if you don&#x27;t the product can make your hair feel a little crunchy.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product - very light and gives great volume and shine to my hair - highly recommend this for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for curly unruly hair!  My hair tends toward frizz and this is the only product that tames it so I even get good hair the second day without too much fuss.  Don&#x27;t use too much though esp at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent price too. I would normally spend $20 for the same at Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip: Never dispense the product unless the bottle is straight upside down. That&#x27;s the only way to get every last drop out. I even store my bottle upside down in the cabinet to remind myself to dispense it that way. I was given that tip at a hair salon where I bought my first bottle.</li>
    <li> Did not care for this.  I have thin fine naturally curly hair.  This product weighed my hair down and felt heavy and grungy.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product... when I purchased it in a salon. But the ones I got in this order smell different, and one can already stopped dispensing after only a week, even though there&#x27;s plenty left in it. (I ordered two.) I&#x27;m disappointed, and now back to looking for ways to buy it in a salon rather than online. It was also packaged in a way that didn&#x27;t protect the cans very well. The plastic lids popped off of both cans in transit. The only reason this is getting two stars instead of one is that the product does still seem to do its job - when it dispenses properly.</li>
    <li> I use just a little bit and it seems to last rather a long time.  It is the best hair mousse that I have used.</li>
    <li> This is so hard to find in retail stores.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that really works to smooth out my hair and remove frizz, without being too heavy.</li>
    <li> Sebastian&#x27;s whipped cream is exactly what I was looking for in my life!!! It was perfect for my long thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have super short hair and love this stuff, can be a bit greesy if you use too much though, probably not the best for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Especially love that it actually looks like whipped cream :)</li>
    <li> I received the item well packaged and timely! The product itself is very easy to use, smells nice, and most importantly did not make my hair feel or look greasy or heavy. This is important because I&#x27;m in Washington D.C. with all the humidity! I have short hair, so it seems like I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it, which is good.</li>
    <li> Will never buy online again. Different than the product I purchase in stores.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! Leaves your hair feeling soft and adds shine, this product does not make your hair feel glossy after usage. This product also smells GREAT which is a major plus :) Very easy product to use and is an excellent value! I suggest that anyone use this product as it does wonders on your hair!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair every time I wash it.  It makes my hair smooth and it holds the curly much better.  No flakes and fuss.</li>
    <li> Great product! Reduces static in my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t give it the heavy weighed down feeling. I Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering this product and I am very amazed by the results. Similar to the consistency of a mousse (light and airy), this whipped cream provided intense moisture and shine. After applying the cream to my freshly washed hair, I was very surprised by how instantly it provided a nice hold to my thick curly hair. Unlike many similar hair creams and gels, this one DID NOT leave my hair feeling &amp;#34;dried-out&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; I honestly believe this product is very innovative and unique (for all hair types).  I will definitely be ordering this product again in the near future.</li>
    <li> very creamy,hair is not stiff like most mousse products.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It leaves my hair soft with a little body.  But the bottle and push pump top leave much to be desired.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work properly and I find using the product a hassle.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a perm in my hair a few months ago. I do bleach my hair. The salon used a special perm formula so my hair would not burn during the perm process. Then she used this \\&quot;SABASTIAN WHIPPED CREAM MOUSSE\\&quot; on my hair after she was finished with the perm. My hair was so soft and silky. I had never heard of \\&quot;SABASTAIN HAIR PRODUCT BEFORE UNTIL THEN.\\&quot; This paticular \\&quot;WHIPPED CREAM MOUSSE\\&quot; has a light conditioner in it. My hair is so soft after my hair dries when using this \\&quot;WHIPPED CREAM MOUSSE\\&quot; on my hair after each wash. I can&#x27;t live without this item for my hair. It is cheaper to get it on Amazon then in the salons. I placed an order of two bottles of this \\&quot;SABASTAIN WHIPPED CREAM MOUSSE\\&quot; for the price of one in the hair salon. I also have been using \\&quot;SABASTIAN STRENGTHING SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER\\&quot; which I order on Amazon. I order one large bottle of shampoo and conditioner so it would last me a long time. I can&#x27; live without this shampoo, conditioner and the \\&quot;WHIPPED CREAM MOUSSE.\\&quot; My hair use to break off a lot after shampooing and conditioning and using a mousse before I discovered the \\&quot;SABASTAIN\\&quot; Products. After using these products, I have much less breakage with my hair and it combs out so easily for me now. I have very fine thin hair and where I live, we get very high humidity and I need a perm at least once a year. My hair also tangles very easily. Since I have been using these products, the comb just slides through my hair without any tangling and breakage. Is what I do when I use the conditioner, I take a medium size tooth comb and comb it through my hair so it will make is much easier for me to comb my hair out after conditoning it and using the \\&quot;WHIPPED CREAM MOUSSE.\\&quot; It leaves my hair so soft and shiney and it does not make my hair oily or dry looking. I highly recommend these products if you have fine thin hair or if you process your hair like I do. I will never go back to the store bought shampoo and conditioner and Mousse ever again. Also a lot of the Salon products as well. Thank you \\&quot;SABASTIAN FOR MAKING SUCH GREAT HAIR PRODUCTS.\\&quot; To all of the sellers who sell SABASTAIN PRODUCTS, PLEASE DO NOT STOP SELLING ON AMAZON.\\&quot;</li>
