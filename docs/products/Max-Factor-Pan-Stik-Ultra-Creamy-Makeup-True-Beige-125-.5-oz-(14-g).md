      <li>I ordered this for a friend and she is very pleased.</li>

      <li>No other cover stick even comes close- creamy, blends in perfectly, and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>We all love it.  </li>

      <li>I love this when I am on the go and traveling because we know makeup wears off</li>
      <li>many of it&#x27;s faithful users when USA stopped selling it here where it originated.</li>
      <li>I love love this product.</li>
      <li>guess I&#x27;m kinda cute..</li>

      <li>It goes on smoothly and is very easy and quick to apply.  </li>
      <li>Super easy to apply, love the portability of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can use this product and some light powder and the pan-stik will stay on all day.</li>
      <li>I would order it again if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll find that it is available for nine bucks on drugstore dot com.  </li>
      <li>Only if you&#x27;re gonna wear it for maybe 2 hrs, then it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>I wish they were still available in the US.</li>
      <li>I have yet to find a foundation stick that is this easy to apply and truly has a FULL coverage.</li>
      <li>I have used this MaxFactor &amp;#34;Pan-Stik&amp;#34; for a LONG-TIME and LOVE IT (and not because the name is close to sounding like &amp;#34;pancake&amp;#34;), (but if you do decide to eat pancakes...</li>
      <li>This product is excellent for panstick customers but hard to find.</li>
      <li>Later Pan Stik came along and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>i have used this for many years and covers up everything that you need to cover up, perfect foundation especially when you do drag(:</li>
      <li>It does a super job..</li>
      <li>Luckily I found it online</li>
      <li>True Beige is the color I need, and so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find anywhere that has had &amp;#34;true beige&amp;#34; in stock for me to even try.</li>
      <li>I love feelin s_e_x_y and having this opportunity to REUNITE with my my long lost LOVE.....</li>
      <li>This is a product worth searching out on the internet.</li>
      <li>I have searched the department stores without success</li>
      <li>It is the first thing I use when applying my makeup.</li>
      <li>This is my first time to by Max things.</li>
      <li>PRETTY AGAIN THANK YOU, KATIE TATUM</li>
      <li>IT WAS THE FIRST MAKEUP</li>
      <li>It was almost exactly like the Pan Stiks I have</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery; Product exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I absolutely ADORE this makeup.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, but covers well and stays on.  </li>
      <li>I REALLY PANICKED WHEN I COULD NOT FIND MY MAKE</li>
      <li>Have used this makeup for years and it&#x27;s been a very reliable product.  </li>
      <li>I WAS REALLY SAVED BY AMAZON, BECAUSE THEY \\&quot; HAVE \\&quot;</li>
      <li>So, if you buy this great original product for the exorbitant price that is being asked per tube here, beware that if you get hooked (which you likely will), you will soon be sadly disappointed because you will NEVER be able to get it again.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to order as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>Max Factor Pan Stick in the only Makeup that will provide full coverage yet remain lightweight.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this particular product.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores and I needed a new one.</li>
      <li>Normally I throw out old makeup if I haven&#x27;t used it all and buy new ones just because sometimes I am a germ freak</li>
      <li>Max Factor has been my preferred brand of make up since I first started wearing make up back in the 1950&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>The last makeup I bought on line was unuseable and full of gritty sand like particles.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is possible to get extra heavy coverage and comfort, but I am very glad not to need this anymore.</li>
      <li>I have very visible acne scars and this the only thing that covers them completely.</li>
      <li>ALL THE TIME &amp; I&#x27;LL BE 71 YRS OLD IN APRIL.</li>
      <li>It is like finding an old friend again.</li>
      <li>I am 84 years old and had worn Max Factor products since a teenager.  </li>
      <li>complaint is that it&#x27;s a little drying so put on a good moisturizer before applying.</li>
      <li>It is a very heavy make-up, but if applied correctly (to a clean face, after your primer) it holds up well.</li>
      <li>Plus, the price was reasonable--under $10 for a good sized stick that would last me at least 3 months of everyday use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely ADORE this makeup. It is a bit heavy, but manages to cover anything---blemishes, scars, undereye dark circles, freckles---anything! I am very active at work, and needed coverage that could survive perspiration for several hours. FOUND IT. That being said, if you do use this makeup, you have to remember to thoroughly cleanse afterwards and clay mask regularly.</li>
    <li> Using for years!&lt;br /&gt;Love the coverage/blend&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem very heavy although you would think it is based on package&lt;br /&gt;I like a stronger coverage so works for me</li>
    <li> I use this product solely as a concealer for my under-eye circles and blemishes.  I have tried expensive alternatives only to be disappointed.  This is a must-have for me.  However, just google maxfactor and you&#x27;ll find that it is available for nine bucks on drugstore dot com.  Yay!</li>
    <li> THE BEST THERE IS IF WE HERE IN THE STATES COULD GET IT.&lt;br /&gt;STARTED WEARING IT WHEN I WAS 21.&lt;br /&gt;I AM NOW 81 AND STILL LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING IT BACK TO THE USA</li>
    <li> I need a darker shade; otherwise it is great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MAX FACTOR PAN STICK MAKE-UP!!! I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS, IN FACT IT WAS THE FIRST MAKEUP I EVER USED, IT MAKES MY SKIN VELVETY SOFT&amp; BEAUTIFUL. I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME &amp; I&#x27;LL BE 71 YRS OLD IN APRIL. I REALLY PANICKED WHEN I COULD NOT FIND MY MAKE UP ANYWHER IN ANY STORE. I WAS REALLY SAVED BY AMAZON, BECAUSE THEY \\&quot; HAVE \\&quot; MY MAX FACTOR MAKEUP &amp; I ORDERED 3 OF THEM &amp; NOW I&#x27;M HAPPY &amp; PRETTY AGAIN THANK YOU, KATIE TATUM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for decades. It was a SAD DAY for many of it&#x27;s faithful users when USA stopped selling it here where it originated.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I LOVE this makeup. I have only used it for a couple of years, but before that I tried tons of different brands and never found one that matched my skin tone and covered up my blotchy looking acne prone face without looking fake, cakey, or turning me orange. Plus, the price was reasonable--under $10 for a good sized stick that would last me at least 3 months of everyday use. I was hooked. Unfortunately, they have discontinued making this product in the US. A person can buy the European product though, but the problem is that it is about 1/3rd of the size (similar to a sample portion) for a higher price, and I&#x27;m not sure about the color selection. True Beige is the color I need, and so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find anywhere that has had &amp;#34;true beige&amp;#34; in stock for me to even try. Reviews on another site (drugstore.com) say that it is not exactly the same. So, if you buy this great original product for the exorbitant price that is being asked per tube here, beware that if you get hooked (which you likely will), you will soon be sadly disappointed because you will NEVER be able to get it again.  Also beware that these have sat on the shelf for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So sad that Max Factor has disappointed all of us loyal ladies the way that they have! We don&#x27;t want a &amp;#34;new product&amp;#34; that is &amp;#34;just like it but better.&amp;#34; We want the product and price we have relied on for years!</li>
    <li> loved the size,,just not the color,,,,would be nice if this came in # 113, 14 gr,,,,deep olive,,, like the size.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for panstick customers but hard to find. Vermont has it but overpriced. A good substitute is Maybelline cream&lt;br /&gt;stick.,  usually at drug stores locally.  Lorraine</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and 3 relatives.  We all love it.  My daugher and I use it to even out skin tones, cover blemishes and other imperfections.  It does a super job..better then the expensive cremes that are suppose to cover blemishes.  My sister and mom use it soley as a foundation and love it....No matter which way you use it, it gives a flawless look to your skin.  I was so happy to find it on line.</li>
    <li> Max Factor has been my preferred brand of make up since I first started wearing make up back in the 1950&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore but this has been my go-to concealer for a long time. Creamy and easy to apply plus lasts a long time and matches my skin perfectly! Would def recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this all my life. No other cover stick even comes close- creamy, blends in perfectly, and lasts all day. This is a product worth searching out on the internet.</li>
    <li> I wish this product had not been discontinued. My Mom loved it !!!!</li>
    <li> My face has acne scars and this product is amazing. It stays on all day and make my skin look flawless. I wish they would sell the stuff in the stores.</li>
    <li> I only use this for problem areas and not all over but boy the color is wonderful for fair skin!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores and I needed a new one. Luckily I found it online and it&#x27;s great! Really great cover-up!</li>
    <li> This is my first time to by Max things. It is nice, and comfortable. I like the color also. In a word, nice!</li>
    <li> This will cover just about anything, but that&#x27;s also what it feels like.  I don&#x27;t know if it is possible to get extra heavy coverage and comfort, but I am very glad not to need this anymore.</li>
    <li> I have very visible acne scars and this the only thing that covers them completely. It is a very heavy make-up, but if applied correctly (to a clean face, after your primer) it holds up well. I wish they were still available in the US. Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried this makeup based on the reviews and I&#x27;m going to order more, it&#x27;s great! Fast Delivery; Product exactly as described.</li>
    <li> i have used this for many years and covers up everything that you need to cover up, perfect foundation especially when you do drag(:</li>
    <li> O..MY..GOODNESS....I have used this MaxFactor &amp;#34;Pan-Stik&amp;#34; for a LONG-TIME and LOVE IT (and not because the name is close to sounding like &amp;#34;pancake&amp;#34;), (but if you do decide to eat pancakes...it&#x27;s OK, you are covered). When I heard they stopped selling it  in the US, I went into a complete PANIC ( I mean a REAL PANIC) (not like the usual panic-attack I sometimes get at night and hear voices in my head &amp;#34;panic&amp;#34;). I mean this came as a major shock to me, I was like...&amp;#34;how am I suppose to feel like I have sexy skin without this product ?&amp;#34;. I thought I would never find this again, so I had to resort to a &amp;#34;I guess I&#x27;m kinda cute.. foundation/ concealer product that&#x27;s way too expensive&amp;#34;. I have been feeling as though I had to settle for this &amp;#34;so/so cute&amp;#34; look, vs. &amp;#34;borderline play-boy bunny&amp;#34; feel. And lets me honest...every girl would rather feel like a &amp;#34;play-boy bunny&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;bunny-ranch funny&amp;#34;!  I love feelin s_e_x_y and having this opportunity to REUNITE with my my long lost LOVE.....myMaxFactorPan-tastik...ohhh how I love thee.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup, and have used it for over 15 years. It recently became so hard to find, that I had to search online for it. So thankful to have found this, HOWEVER I can&#x27;t believe the price. I used to buy this from the local drug store for under $10. Why the hike in price??? It matched my skin perfectly and had great all day coverage, but I simply can&#x27;t afford it at this price. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love using this makeup.  It goes on smoothly and is very easy and quick to apply.  I will continue to order as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I received the product I ordered. It was almost exactly like the Pan Stiks I have that are almost gone. I would order it again if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 45 years and it is still the best foundation ever made. You can put it on sheer or use it as a thicker dab for concealment of blemishes or age spots. It is the best foundation ever made. Period.</li>
    <li> It has a matte finish and my skin is oily so it&#x27;s not a good match. Only if you&#x27;re gonna wear it for maybe 2 hrs, then it&#x27;s great.  A bit heavy.  But nice over all.</li>
    <li> Max Factor Pan Stick in the only Makeup that will provide full coverage yet remain lightweight. Doesn&#x27;t make me sweat like some makeup.</li>
    <li> I love love this product. They stopped selling Max Factor at the stores here in Alaska or at least I have not found anymore. I have had the same stick for over 3-4 years. Normally I throw out old makeup if I haven&#x27;t used it all and buy new ones just because sometimes I am a germ freak but since I could not find this product anymore I kept this one longer than any other makeup. I only use this as an enhancer for my face. I like to apply under and over my eyes for an eye brightener and a little on lower forehead. I can use this product and some light powder and the pan-stik will stay on all day. I love this when I am on the go and traveling because we know makeup wears off but this stik helps brighten my face all day/night long. Some people do not think I have makeup on. Even my horrible critiquing sisters (haha) can not tell. Especially after my son, this is my go-to-makeup I will always have on, just below my eyes. You defiantly will not be disappointed with this stik. It is the first thing I use when applying my makeup. As with all makeup, you will need to learn how to apply it correctly with your skin tone and learn what works for you.</li>
    <li> Great Product having been using it for years. Sorry that they discontue distributing the products in Duane Reade found it very convenient.But, not to worry I can always go online and order it.</li>
    <li> I love to use this foundation stick! It&#x27;s easy, portable and perfect for full face if you want a full coverage or it&#x27;s great as a concealer. I have yet to find a foundation stick that is this easy to apply and truly has a FULL coverage. I have olive skin and use the true beige shade, however, it really is ok if it is too light as you can go over it with a darker powder and it looks great!</li>
    <li> So glad I could find it here! I have used it for years!  It is like finding an old friend again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this make for 47 years and love it.  The last makeup I bought on line was unuseable and full of gritty sand like particles.  Wish someone would start making this again.  I can&#x27;t find a good replacement at any price.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I read a review on it in a magazine.  However, couldn&#x27;t find Max factor sold anywhere in town.  It seems like less needs to be used.  It&#x27;s gentle, but covers well and stays on.  I will continue to use this particular product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on Bobbi Brown&#x27;s so I tried this. The coverage is heavy enough but without being goopey, lighter coverage than Bobbi Brown&#x27;s. Super easy to apply, love the portability of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little drying so put on a good moisturizer before applying.</li>
    <li> Have used this makeup for years and it&#x27;s been a very reliable product.  Nice color, good coverage and very natural looking.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend and she is very pleased. She had a hard time locating it elsewhere. She uses it every day and always looks great!</li>
    <li> I am 84 years old and had worn Max Factor products since a teenager.  I started with pan cake makeup that was applied with a  damp sponge. Later Pan Stik came along and I loved it.  I was horrified when I found out Max Factor had removed all their products before I could even buy up a supply!  I still don&#x27;t know why they did!&lt;br /&gt;I just  decided to see if I could get something through Amazon and was happy to see I could get just the color Pan Stik I needed so I have ordered several along and hope I can continue to get it!!</li>
    <li> I have searched the department stores without success and I was so delighted to find this long-loved product on line.</li>
