      <li>The quality is amazing.</li>
      <li>It effectively grooms my thinning hair, without any scalp irritation.</li>
      <li>Nice brush.</li>
      <li>This model is also excellent for brushing your beard - again, unless your beard is extremely long, tangly and bristly itself, in which case you ought to be looking at a stiffer brush, like the really beautiful ebony handled</li>
      <li>Cost is high, but the best brush I have ever bought.</li>
      <li>I have used Kent for many years now and they are my very favorite.  </li>
      <li>The Kent web site was excellent in describing what types of brushes are good for different types of hair.  </li>
      <li>It lays nicely in the hand, the wood is beautiful and beautifully finished, and with a reasonable amount of care - as in none to speak of, really</li>
      <li>This is a really well made product, it looks good and feels good and performs well</li>

      <li>Many of times I felt they were more of a problem than a measure of control for the problem.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a finely finished bit of furniture.</li>
      <li>I wanted a high-quality brush that could fit easily in my travel kit -- this one exceeds expectations and has very fine workmanship.</li>
      <li>I believe it was manufactured by Kent, and but for the fact the shellac has long ago worn off the beautiful beech and satin wood handle, and the fact that the stiffer bristles that worked when I had a lot more hair and wore it a lot longer are no longer appropriate, it could go on working for me for another 30 years,</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful brush that will last again for years to come.</li>
      <li>Although it is a beautiful brush, now a year later, the wood is covered in mold that somehow got under the finish.</li>
      <li>great for travel since there&#x27;s no long handle.</li>
      <li>Excellent brush albeit a little pricy...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that I no longer have any tiny sores.</li>
      <li>Kent combs and brushes are some of the finest available.</li>
      <li>My scalp has always been tender to the touch even when lightly combing my hair.</li>
      <li>Fantastic brush.</li>
      <li>father will enjoy it.</li>
      <li>For fine hair on an old man&#x27;s thinning hair it is a godsend for fine grooming.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money</li>
      <li>This brush is worth its price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;That is the way these brushes used to be sold in the old days :)</li>
      <li>but no matter what it not even worth 10$ if your in it for waves.</li>
      <li>and I decided to do a little more researching before buying another of the same kind.  </li>
      <li>-- it ought to last a good long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft enough to allow you to brush with nice firm strokes without any scratching or discomfort - and in fact, it feels darned good and is just the right &#x27;stiffness&#x27; to brush my hair and to massage the ever expanding places the hair has decided to quit, surrender and vacate to more or less bare scalp.  </li>
      <li>I thought that this was the normal marketing hype, but after the first couple of times that I used this brush, I was sold.  </li>
      <li>Very pricey at $70.</li>
      <li>An absolute pleasure to use ..</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t move much hair.</li>
      <li>The Soft bristles move smoothly through the hair and bring the natural oils to the surface bringing everything into line.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect brush for men with Short Thin Hair or receding hairline.</li>
      <li>I bought this one due to it&#x27;s recommendation for use on fine or thinning hair - that&#x27;s me!</li>
      <li>I am older and my hair is thinner than it was 20 years ago</li>
      <li>The bristles are a little softer and it just feels better going through my hair.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product after owning a few of Kent&#x27;s combs, which are top notch.</li>
      <li>Bristles are just the right stiffness, especially if your have thinning hair.</li>
      <li>If you wear your hair rather short, if you wear your hair in fringes because some of it has left the building, or if you just have particularly fine hair, this is the brush for you.</li>
      <li>The English certainly know their bristles.</li>
      <li>The soft bristles are really a pleasure to use - if you have short and/or thinning hair.</li>
      <li>A number of others complain that the brush is too soft for their hair.  </li>
      <li>This is for people with short, very thin/balding hair, or for kids or babies.</li>
      <li>and he got it from his Father, so this tells you how old the brush was.</li>
      <li>Not quite as soft as ancticipated.</li>
      <li>The bristles are extremely soft.</li>
      <li>Way too soft.</li>
      <li>I was looking to replace a 20 year old Crabtree and Evelyn hair brush</li>
      <li>This brush, as advertised, has bristles that are quite soft.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are extremely soft, and yet functional.</li>
      <li>I went on-line and looked for a SOFT brush made from horse hair.</li>
      <li>As promoted, the brush is soft and gentle to fine and thin hair scalp.</li>
      <li>This brush is ok to start but after a week, it is no good.</li>
      <li>I tried numerous dandruff shampoo&#x27;s with only moderate success.</li>
      <li>This may sound a little bit like a commercial</li>
      <li>You pay a premium for these Kent brushes versus other brands, but they are definitely worth the difference, particularly considering how long these brushes last.</li>
      <li>Based off of my previous experience with this product, it would be kind of hard to recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>should I live so long.  </li>
      <li>Started this review a few months ago and update is that husband really, really likes this brush!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome brush for those of us who have become folically challenged over the years. Feels great.</li>
    <li> My husband had a brush similar to this that his Dad gave to him and he got it from his Father, so this tells you how old the brush was. It finally was on its last leg and my husband had been searching for one ever since. This brush was perfect and he loves it. This is a beautiful brush that will last again for years to come.</li>
    <li> Well it is a Kent hairbrush so it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that it is just a wonderful product.  I have used Kent for many years now and they are my very favorite.  I still have another one I bought thirty-five years ago!</li>
    <li> Nice brush. Not quite as soft as ancticipated.</li>
    <li> I wanted a high-quality brush that could fit easily in my travel kit -- this one exceeds expectations and has very fine workmanship.</li>
    <li> What, this is the flyest brush of all time</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a replacement for the hair brush that had lasted him over 30 years. Last November I bought the Kent MS23D Military Brush for him. Although it is a beautiful brush, now a year later, the wood is covered in mold that somehow got under the finish. It is a mystery how this could happen because he never put it in water, but merely used it on slightly damp hair. Either the finish was defective or there was already some mold in the wood. Very disappointing and leaves me not knowing what brush to buy next.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush. Build quality is perfect. An absolute pleasure to use .. bristles are wonderful. Great scalp feel. Cost is high, but the best brush I have ever bought. More than happy with this purchase. A+</li>
    <li> This brush is ok to start but after a week, it is no good. The bristles start to come out instantly and the clean up from it is annoying. Maybe I received a defect...it would be an excellent brush if the quality was better for the price. Based off of my previous experience with this product, it would be kind of hard to recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This brush is simply amazing. Well worth the price. You hair will thank you for this investment. I use it to manage my waves. I also bought the Kent MN1B a week later for 99.99 thats how sold i am on the products.</li>
    <li> I have owned this brush for over a year.  Use it approx. once a day.  It is perfect, still like new.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to all!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush albeit a little pricy...</li>
    <li> Time passes, and it dawned on me that the badly beaten up Crabtree &amp; Evelyn boar bristle hairbrush I&#x27;ve toted around in my travel kit bag is going on 30 years old. I believe it was manufactured by Kent, and but for the fact the shellac has long ago worn off the beautiful beech and satin wood handle, and the fact that the stiffer bristles that worked when I had a lot more hair and wore it a lot longer are no longer appropriate, it could go on working for me for another 30 years, should I live so long.  Here is the Kent brush as made today, and every bit as well made as before.  This brush, as advertised, has bristles that are quite soft.  If you wear your hair rather short, if you wear your hair in fringes because some of it has left the building, or if you just have particularly fine hair, this is the brush for you. It lays nicely in the hand, the wood is beautiful and beautifully finished, and with a reasonable amount of care - as in none to speak of, really -- it ought to last a good long time. The soft bristles are really a pleasure to use - if you have short and/or thinning hair. It&#x27;s soft enough to allow you to brush with nice firm strokes without any scratching or discomfort - and in fact, it feels darned good and is just the right &#x27;stiffness&#x27; to brush my hair and to massage the ever expanding places the hair has decided to quit, surrender and vacate to more or less bare scalp.  This model is also excellent for brushing your beard - again, unless your beard is extremely long, tangly and bristly itself, in which case you ought to be looking at a stiffer brush, like the really beautiful ebony handled Kent military brush MN1B or the even stiffer black bristled Kent men&#x27;s models.  A number of reviews here claim these are poorly made.  I find that difficult to believe. Mine certainly is not. It&#x27;s more like a finely finished bit of furniture. A number of others complain that the brush is too soft for their hair.  I suggest those folks blame themselves for not reading the product description and choosing to buy the wrong model, rather than blame a company that has manufactured top drawer brushes for over a century for making a brush that is, as advertised, made with &amp;#34;soft bristles&amp;#34; suited to men with &amp;#34;fine and thinning hair.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush for men with Short Thin Hair or receding hairline. The Soft bristles move smoothly through the hair and bring the natural oils to the surface bringing everything into line. This is a really well made product, it looks good and feels good and performs well</li>
    <li> Way too soft. Doesn&#x27;t move much hair. Bristles starting to fall out.</li>
    <li> This may sound a little bit like a commercial but I assure you it isn&#x27;t. This is my personal experience. I have always used a comb and had never used a brush. I always thought that using a brush was for women only. Well that thinking was wrong. For years, I dealt with dandruff and occasional tiny pustules on my scalp. I&#x27;d also get in-grown hairs which would get infected. My scalp has always been tender to the touch even when lightly combing my hair. I tried numerous dandruff shampoo&#x27;s with only moderate success. Many of times I felt they were more of a problem than a measure of control for the problem. Finally my wife suggested I may not be getting enough simulation to my scalp from my comb. Thus she suggested I find and purchase a quality hair brush made of horse hair. I went on-line and looked for a SOFT brush made from horse hair. I finally purchased the Kent Military Brush for that reason. I&#x27;ve had it now for a month and I&#x27;m happy to say that I no longer have any tiny sores. My hair feels fuller, scalp is a lot less sensitive and the dandruff is all but gone. I&#x27;m still using a dandruff shampoo but considering stopping it once I use it all up. I&#x27;m using the brush twice a day (after morning shower and at bedtime). I use it about a minute going in all directions trying to simulate my entire scalp and the hair follicles. This seems to have worked for me. Hopefully this review and this brush will help someone else too.</li>
    <li> arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;brush was well packaged by mfg</li>
    <li> This brush is not good for waves. It just has a costly price tag but no matter what it not even worth 10$ if your in it for waves.</li>
    <li> The English certainly know their bristles. I bought this one due to it&#x27;s recommendation for use on fine or thinning hair - that&#x27;s me! It didn&#x27;t disappoint. The brush feels godd going through the hair, doesn&#x27;t pull, and does a good job at massging the scalp. Very comfortable brush. And with Kent quality, I&#x27;ll surely have it for many, many years to come.</li>
    <li> Bristles were a little too soft and weak for me so I ended up tossing it.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace a 20 year old Crabtree and Evelyn hair brush and I decided to do a little more researching before buying another of the same kind.  I am glad I did.  The Kent web site was excellent in describing what types of brushes are good for different types of hair.  I am older and my hair is thinner than it was 20 years ago and I noted that this brush was made for just that type of hair.  I thought that this was the normal marketing hype, but after the first couple of times that I used this brush, I was sold.  The bristles are a little softer and it just feels better going through my hair.  You pay a premium for these Kent brushes versus other brands, but they are definitely worth the difference, particularly considering how long these brushes last.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Very pricey at $70. for ONE brush. I know&lt;br /&gt;my father will enjoy it. I wish they had 2 brushes for the price.&lt;br /&gt;That is the way these brushes used to be sold in the old days :)</li>
    <li> Perfect men&#x27;s brush for thinning hair and easy on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Also great for travel since there&#x27;s no long handle.</li>
    <li> Great brush if you can afford it. Probably will last a lifetime. Bristles are just the right stiffness, especially if your have thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Kent combs and brushes are some of the finest available. Have used the combs for years. Hard to find. Nice Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for my husband! Started this review a few months ago and update is that husband really, really likes this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush is worth its price.  For fine hair on an old man&#x27;s thinning hair it is a godsend for fine grooming.  Buy it with confidence.  You can get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging, and it appears the brush is constructed from premium materials. The bristles are extremely soft, and yet functional. It effectively grooms my thinning hair, without any scalp irritation. As other reviewers have reported, my scalp feels healthier since I started using the brush a couple of months ago. I am still finding a few detached bristles after use, which is why the (4) star rating. If the bristle loss continues, and the brush integrity deteriorates, I will downgrade my current rating.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and have fine/thin hair, you will love this brush. It makes my hair look fuller and does not pull out my hairs. The bristles are soft and firm (if that makes sense) and it almost feels like my head is getting a massage. Don&#x27;t let the price deter you from buying this. You get what you pay for and this is one top notch brush. The quality is amazing.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after owning a few of Kent&#x27;s combs, which are top notch. This isn&#x27;t a bad product by any means but it simply does not suit my hair type. This is for people with short, very thin/balding hair, or for kids or babies. The bristles are extremely soft. I&#x27;m a male with hair about 6 inches long and medium coarseness. The bristles can&#x27;t breach through my hair to the scalp. The craftsmanship is on par with all Kent products. I think it needs to be reiterated how soft these bristles are before you waste 60 bucks on a brush like I did!</li>
    <li> Best soft brush I ever had, feels great on my head.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush and now I am finally getting use to it not having a handle.  I also have a second Kent Brush and the other one does have a handle.</li>
    <li> As promoted, the brush is soft and gentle to fine and thin hair scalp. Shipment was fast and item was packaged beautifully.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money it was a great gift for my husband who loves it. He finally threw out an outworn brush he had for years which was  definitely NOT a Kent brush.  Kent brushes are quality products.</li>
