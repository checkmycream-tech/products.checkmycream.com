      <li>Good cream.</li>
      <li>It feels good on the skin, but didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>Again, they got the texture perfect - goes on smooth, no pulling, feels substantial on the skin but not weighty.</li>

      <li>Love this!  </li>

      <li>Love this cream!</li>
      <li>but this stuff is really amazing.  </li>
      <li>So, unless I get some kind of face lift, I will always have wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice feeling and smelling cream but as to any lifting and firming, it does not do either.</li>
      <li>plus it&#x27;s effective.</li>
      <li>Its a nice face lotion to use under make up or at night.</li>
      <li>They said it was low-scent, gentle, non-stinging, non-sticky, perfect under make-up, and most of all...</li>
      <li>It is nice to be able to maintain/recapture some of that dewy youthful look that we all take for granted when we have it.</li>

      <li>It has a very light scent that disappears soon after putting it on.  </li>
      <li>Very smooth and refreshing to my skin</li>
      <li>I use it over my Daily Defense Lotion for the perfect dewey look.  </li>
      <li>I love this line.</li>
      <li>Love this product and better price then seen at stores.</li>
      <li>I probably sound like I work for the company but, believe me, I&#x27;m just a 40-something consumer who obsesses over skin care!</li>
      <li>Tried it - pleasant smell, nice texture, decent moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, feels creamy, and leaves my face feeling soft and happy.</li>
      <li>Do they make it in a gallon-size? :)</li>
      <li>I still wear foundation, but my skin looks so much better.</li>
      <li>I got this yesterday and I am in love.  </li>
      <li>My favorite cream which I spend $90 for a bottle of peptide with kinetin and zeatin cream, doesn&#x27;t even help anymore.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>Glowing skin hides many flaws, so anyone with mature/ing skin may want to try the deweylook as an alternative to matte.</li>
      <li>Most face creams you should not use around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>My skin loves the Andalou products, but not all of them, and that is okay.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s more than just icing on the cake for this consumer.</li>
      <li>I love the way gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>I love the way this product feels and acts like an emolient to my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin has a more even tone, is smoothere, &amp; softer.</li>
      <li>I love it ~~ perfect for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>This also has a light, natural, fruity scent that is very pleasant without being strong.</li>
      <li>Every product is super effective.  </li>
      <li>is light is great so far my skin is looking better</li>
      <li>Ok, so this is fantastic because it promotes cell turnover.  </li>
      <li>Order was delivered promptly and so far I am happy with the results.</li>
      <li>It goes right into the skin, not sit on top as most.</li>
      <li>First, I just want to note that I did not purchase my Andalou products from Amazon, but from a popular health food market.</li>
      <li>Another fine product from Andalou.  </li>
      <li>and yeah, it works fine</li>
      <li>Not heavy but light and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it smells, the texture is nice and it is not heavy.  </li>
      <li>I have autoimmune issues and require chemical and gluten free and this line is both</li>
      <li>It feels fantastic and isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
      <li>I have access to moisturizer from a famous make up company based in Dallas, TX (you know which one I am talking about, right MK?)</li>
      <li>Like all the other products, it smells incredible without being overpowering.  </li>
      <li>This makes it oilier than the original cream.</li>
      <li>The texture is rich and ohhh soooo creamy.</li>
      <li>Was excited until saw the list of ingredients (drugstore.com lists all Lift&amp;Firm ingredients)</li>
      <li>So far I am very pleased with the way this serum makes my face look and feel.</li>
      <li>Smells pretty, absorbs quickly, feels oh so nice, and has smoothed and brightened my complexion, I noticed improvements right away.</li>
      <li>Light scent, absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Well the first thing I noticed was this great fruity scent when I tore open the sample package.  </li>
      <li>I am always in search of the natural, yet effective products.  </li>
      <li>Like a light, natural, orange creamsicle without being sickeningly sweet and overpowering, like so many skin care creams.</li>
      <li>I had heard a lot of great things about this creme, here and on other sites.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait before putting make-up on.  </li>
      <li>Only have used a couple of weeks, but my skin looks better and feels better.</li>
      <li>It is absorbed so quick with no residue.</li>
      <li>A very light, wonderfully smooth eye cream that instantly moisturizes and reduces the appearance of lines and creping.</li>
      <li>I found this cream because my roommate works at Whole Foods and got a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Love that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals and all natural.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive to most products.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive eyes that tear up from most lotions and cremes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this daily and have the night cream too, but this and the night cream seem equally effective.  </li>
      <li>I really love this product, plus its natural.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this cream, because it received such good reviews.  </li>
      <li>The texture and appearance is somewhat creamy (rather than clear) and goes on smooth without pulling, which is very important when you have mature or maturing skin.</li>
      <li>i order a second jar to make sure i don&#x27;t run out keeps my face super moister</li>
      <li>I am a new super fan of Andalou!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Look forward to putting this on. It feels great and seems to moisturize without being greasy. Only have used a couple of weeks, but my skin looks better and feels better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having the hardest time with my skin lately. Just hit my mid-thirties, suddenly I&#x27;m getting these little painful yet itchy white heads and really dry yet oily, flaky skin. This Southern California dry and gross weather isn&#x27;t helping. It&#x27;s so frustrating. My favorite cream which I spend $90 for a bottle of peptide with kinetin and zeatin cream, doesn&#x27;t even help anymore. I decided to buy this and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s soothing and it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin exactly the way I need it to without being too heavy or oily. I&#x27;m still in the beginnings of using this cream, so I will update in 2-3 weeks but I have much confidence in it so far.</li>
    <li> First, I just want to note that I did not purchase my Andalou products from Amazon, but from a popular health food market. My review is strictly about the products themselves. Here is what I&#x27;ve used so far:  Lift and Firm Cream: The first thing I noticed was the pleasant, light scent. It smells fruity, almost peachy, and very natural - no artificial or overpowering scents at all. The texture is rich and ohhh soooo creamy. It is thick and substantial, yet it feels light and spreads luxuriously over the skin. My face feels thoroughly pampered by this cream. And after the first application there seemed to be a difference in the firmness of my skin. It also makes my face (and fingers) feel silky to the touch. The label says it can be used AM and PM but I&#x27;ve decided to make this my night cream. As a new Andalou user, I can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results.  Revitalizing Serum: This also has a light, natural, fruity scent that is very pleasant without being strong. The texture and appearance is somewhat creamy (rather than clear) and goes on smooth without pulling, which is very important when you have mature or maturing skin. So far I am very pleased with the way this serum makes my face look and feel. The label says to use AM and PM under moisturizer.  Daily Defense Facial Lotion: This stuff smells amazing! Like a light, natural, orange creamsicle without being sickeningly sweet and overpowering, like so many skin care creams. Again, they got the texture perfect - goes on smooth, no pulling, feels substantial on the skin but not weighty. It is the perfect foundation for use under makeup and gives the skin a nice, healthy glow. I love this stuff!  Omega Glow Facial Concentrate: If you like dewey, glowing skin, this is the ultimate product (and my personal favorite from Andalou). It is oil-based yet it absorbs beautifully into the skin leaving a healthy sheen without looking greasy. Glowing skin hides many flaws, so anyone with mature/ing skin may want to try the deweylook as an alternative to matte. Once again, the scent is amazing! It&#x27;s hard to describe; it&#x27;s not fruity like the others - it&#x27;s natural, earthy and sensual, like having aromatherapy on your face. My husband loves the scent. I love the way gives my skin a healthy glow. I use it over my Daily Defense Lotion for the perfect dewey look.  Luminous Eye Serum: A very light, wonderfully smooth eye cream that instantly moisturizes and reduces the appearance of lines and creping. It is nearly unscented. Feels like silk. Another fine product from Andalou.  Blossom and Leaf Toner: I spray this on my face throughout the day to re-hydrate and freshen my skin. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and gives my senses a boost. Like all the other products, it smells incredible without being overpowering.  I know to the skeptic I probably sound like I work for the company but, believe me, I&#x27;m just a 40-something consumer who obsesses over skin care! And I am extremely picky. Before discovering Andalou I was a devoted Arbonne user for years and was devastated when they changed the formula (and ruined) their RE9 line. I would have used their products for life if they didn&#x27;t change. But they did and I was left wondering if I would ever find \\&quot;love\\&quot; again in a skin care line. Not only did Andalou fill Arbonne&#x27;s shoes, they have them beat on so many levels. Just go to their website and read what they are all about, you will fall in love too! And they are much easier on the wallet! For the quality of the ingredients and results, you would expect to pay double, if not triple the amount.  Best of all, their products are vegan and cruelty-free! No animal testing, no animal ingredients. That&#x27;s more than just icing on the cake for this consumer.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin, Works perfectly under my makeup.  Also, I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 4+weeks and it has yet to cause a reaction.  I say that, because I have worn natural/organic lotions in the past and after a couple of weeks I breakout in tiny(pinpoint size) bumps and have to stop using the lotion for a week (I would alternate with another).</li>
    <li> The box of the cream was opened, it said on the box there was a sample of something, which was missing, which is fine, just not sure why the box would be open.</li>
    <li> May face feels wonderful and the smell is divine.  This is a constant daily routine for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m picky when it comes to products I put on my face. I don&#x27;t even wear powders or concealer because it usually bothers me. This moisturizer feels amazing! I have dry skin and this just sucks right in. It smells nice, feels creamy, and leaves my face feeling soft and happy.</li>
    <li> Great product, not as good as the night cream or the rose petal cream, but still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I ordered three products and they came in three separate packages. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Great product, really love the smell and feel!</li>
    <li> Love this cream, goes on really nice! Does not leave your skin greasy and it really softens and moisturizes my skin!</li>
    <li> really like this product. Wear it alone or as a base before spf product.</li>
    <li> I am always in search of the natural, yet effective products.  The one thing I could never settle on was a natural facial moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve tried the range of $200-35 (natural or not).  And, finally found a fantastic replacement for my &amp;#34;always go back to&amp;#34; (and have to laugh) Olay Hydra Firm.  The Andalou Super Goji, smells nice, has a lovely texture, and really works great!  I am a new super fan of Andalou!</li>
    <li> The box displayed the statement that this product is for very dry skin so I was a bit hesitant to use it because I know what happens when I use too much oil on my skin; however, I have not had any problems and I do not have very dry skin.  You can feel the difference when the cream is applied, it is very smooth and a slight tightening of the skin can be felt.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for awhile and really enjoy how I can even apply it on my dry lips and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film or bad taste.</li>
    <li> Love this product and better price then seen at stores.</li>
    <li> Andalou Naturals produce some of the nicest skin care product I have ever used.  Every product is super effective.  I have very sensitive, &amp; very dry skin. I am also over 40. It is absorbed so quick with no residue. My skin has a more even tone, is smoothere, &amp; softer.</li>
    <li> Good cream.Not too greasy. Love that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals and all natural. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, plus its natural.</li>
    <li> Great ingredients and great results! Antioxidant and moisturizing benefits. I think some reviewers were upset because the name of the product changed.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with ANDALOU PRODUCTS!!!</li>
    <li> Love this!  my skin has a lot of redness, acne scars, &amp; chicken pox scars. Andalou Naturals&lt;br /&gt;Super Goji Peptide  has improved my skin&#x27;s texture. I still wear foundation, but my skin looks so much better. I have recently ordered other  Andalou products and can&#x27;t wait so see what improvement they can provide!</li>
    <li> I use his in conjunction with Andalou Fruit Stem Cell Revitalize Serum. Its a nice face lotion to use under make up or at night. Light scent, absorbs quickly. I have very dry skin and this hydrates me well.</li>
    <li> Ordered this after being advised to use peptides in my facial cream.  Order was delivered promptly and so far I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have tried moisturizer after moisturizer and this one is the first one that is awesome. I have a sun induced spot on my face and it is fading with daily use of this cream. I did not think I would ever see it go away. It is also brightening up my skin. I would recommend it to any woman, especially us slightly older women. It is nice to be able to maintain/recapture some of that dewy youthful look that we all take for granted when we have it. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry, because it is all natural it won&#x27;t do any harm and who doesn&#x27;t like soft skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It is of medium thickness so glides on and covers well, but not cakey or greasy. It absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait before putting make-up on.  It has a very light scent that disappears soon after putting it on.  Also, I have fairly sensitive skin and this has never made me break out or increased the oiliness of my skin which is a huge plus. I&#x27;ve actually had less breakouts. This is my second bottle and my skin does seem more even and the age spots have definitely lightened.  I use this cream with the andalou fruit stem cells serum and they both work well together.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and refreshing to my skin</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for lift and firm, I was very excited to give it a chance.  However, what was delivered was something called gogi cream.  Thinking  it was just a label change of some sort, I looked more closely at the label and found it was a different product that they have replaced the lift and firm with.  They don&#x27;t tell you that what they&#x27;re doing, they just send it.  I have to agree with the previous rater that the ingredients are different and I will be trying an enirely different product than what  was what was reviewed here prior to January,2013.  If I were you, I&#x27;d wait for a month to see what people who actually use to gogi cream experience before spending hard earned money on a new prooduct.</li>
    <li> 02/04/13 so the only thing i can said right now i like the smell also is light not heavy or leave face oily i will placed another review when i finish this jar i hope i see the difference before that happens UPDATE 03/08/13  i have been using this cream for 1 month an so far i really like it i order a second jar to make sure i don&#x27;t run out keeps my face super moister is light is great so far my skin is looking better</li>
    <li> It is a nice feeling and smelling cream but as to any lifting and firming, it does not do either.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot of great things about this creme, here and on other sites. They said it was low-scent, gentle, non-stinging, non-sticky, perfect under make-up, and most of all...effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can attest to the fact that it is all of those things. I now put it not only on my face, but the backs of my hands, neck, and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is super smooth and the scent is kind of like a very faint natural berry (well, duh). Andalou doesn&#x27;t beef up the scents of their products with anything artificial, so whatever something smells like is just from what it is. I have really sensitive eyes that tear up from most lotions and cremes. So, most of the products I&#x27;ve tried wearing don&#x27;t make it past the first night. But after a couple of night&#x27;s wear, I knew this creme was not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One question: Do they make it in a gallon-size? :)</li>
    <li> My sister, an esthetician, turned me on to this cream. I use it every night. I love it! I have sensitive skin and this never irritates it.</li>
    <li> I have access to moisturizer from a famous make up company based in Dallas, TX (you know which one I am talking about, right MK?) and yeah, it works fine but it didn&#x27;t make me go, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;.  It simply kept my face from drying in the winter.  I got a little sample of this product at a health food store and I planned on using it for a quick overnight trip in order to keep from having to pack a whole tube of the pink packaged moisturizer I got from the MK sales representative.  I am allergic to a lot of products so another concern was a reaction while on a business trip.  Well the first thing I noticed was this great fruity scent when I tore open the sample package.  Not heavy but light and pleasant.  This stuff is thicker than my typical moisturizer and goes on silky smooth.  It absorbs fast in that I can apply it and by the time I finish blow drying my short hair, it is soaked in and I am ready to apply powder.  I plan on buying some more of this stuff either on Amazon or the next time I go to the healthfood store that carries this product.  Excellent stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this line. I have autoimmune issues and require chemical and gluten free and this line is both plus it&#x27;s effective.</li>
    <li> Edit: 1/4/17 I had to discontinue using this product. It started making me break out with continued use. I am one of those people that cannot use anything with a cream base. It feels good on the skin, but didn&#x27;t work for me.  My skin is sensitive to most products. Even some natural products break me out. I have searched high and low for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t have Dimethicone which makes my whole face burn and itch. It is difficult to find a product without it. Other moisturizers I have tried &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34;/tighten after putting them on and make my skin look more wrinkled after using them. This does not pull at all! It goes right into the skin, not sit on top as most. It is very emollient going on, but I would say it is neither too light nor too heavy. It is perfect morning/night and under makeup. I used to buy moisturizers with SPF for day, but I have switched to the Mineral Fusion pressed powder foundation with natural sunscreens so I don&#x27;t add any harmful chemicals on my face during the day. I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and I am so happy I discovered the Andalou line.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this cream, because it received such good reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my skin.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s not perfumed and it goes on smoothly, and my face is soft, but overall, I expected a bit more.</li>
    <li> I got this yesterday and I am in love.  I have never liked a skincare product enough to bother with a review but this stuff is really amazing.  The smell.... heaven, not sweet or cloying like some moisturizers tend to be, but just enough.  It feels fantastic and isn&#x27;t oily.  I&#x27;m back online looking to order more Andalou products.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels and acts like an emolient to my skin. I use it around my eyes during the day before I apply my regular day time cream. I use it on my neck, and on my face at night. I bought this because the products were pure without ingredients that were risky! Ended up that I loved the product on top of that reason!</li>
    <li> My skin loves the Andalou products, but not all of them, and that is okay.  I think you have to experiment to find the ones that are for your skin.  I have combo skin with a tendency to breakout.  This Perfecting Cream has been great for my skin and has caused NO breakouts for me.  I love the way it smells, the texture is nice and it is not heavy.  Even though it is supposed to help with wrinkles (ant-aging), my skin will always have wrinkles due to past sun damage, and I used to be a smoker (this did the most damage).  So, unless I get some kind of face lift, I will always have wrinkles.  But, the Andalou products have helped my skin in that it does not feel dry anymore (in my dry zones), and I do not get oily (in my T-zone).  Just know that if you have damaged skin due to environmental, sun, smoking, and age, no product will make wrinkles go away.  This product makes my skin feel great and nourished.  I also use the Kombucha cleansing gel.  I use another natural product for my eye area, toner, and firming treatment.  Also, you can use this around the eye area which is a bonus.  Most face creams you should not use around the eyes.  Andalou does NOT do animal testing.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Not too greasy. It&#x27;s easy on sensitive skin. Smells FANTASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for awhile and think it smooths out the skin. It is a good alternative to the VERY expensive creams on the market. Even with the shipping charge, the  price was better than at a local store.</li>
    <li> I love it ~~ perfect for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> My mum gave me this as a gift, and now I&#x27;m on my second container.  Smells pretty, absorbs quickly, feels oh so nice, and has smoothed and brightened my complexion, I noticed improvements right away.</li>
    <li> it makes your skin glow,nice fruity smell and it works a bit on the wrinkles too..overall i look more fresh ,glowing and a lil younger</li>
    <li> I am not using any other moisturizers ever again!  I do keep an aveno basic around for the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ok, so this is fantastic because it promotes cell turnover.  That means my skin is now rejuvenating itself at a faster rate.  I use to suffer from mild eczema, and this causes a small breakout to disappear in 24 hours!  My boyfriend even commented to me that I don&#x27;t get my dry patches (eczema ) anymore.  I told him I found this cream and how great it works,.  I found this cream because my roommate works at Whole Foods and got a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;Also my skin looks like a 20 year olds and glows! It is soft too.  (I&#x27;m 42)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I even got a bad cold and you know when you get dry skin under the nose...?  Well used this and gone by next day.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m using this daily and have the night cream too, but this and the night cream seem equally effective.  I use to buy very very expensive creams but this is all I now ever need.  I do use this daily, for if I don&#x27;t, my skin will go back to being dry and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t stop making this product!!!!!  I looove it so much...</li>
    <li> Initially found this product at a local store and fell in love with it.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  Great product!</li>
    <li> VERY MISLEADING. I ordered Superpolypeptide  Lift &amp; Firm cream, but received Super Gogi Peptide Perfecting Cream which supposedly is the new version of the same thing. Tried it - pleasant smell, nice texture, decent moisturizer. Was excited until saw the list of ingredients (drugstore.com lists all Lift&amp;Firm ingredients) - they are not the same!&lt;br /&gt;In Lift &amp; Firm, Water is the second ingredient. Palmitoyl tripeptides 1 and 3 are 12th and 13th; they are the only proven anti-aging ingredients in the cream. Marked \\&quot;Age Defying\\&quot;, \\&quot;For normal to dry, sensitive\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Now, there are no Palmitoyl tripeptides 1 and 3 in Super Goji ingredient list. Only goji glycopeptides, 8-berry complex and apple stem cells, with NO reliable research regarding long-term benefits of their use. Also, sunflower oil as a second ingredient. This makes it oilier than the original cream. Likely will clog my pores.It is now marked \\&quot;for dry and sensitive\\&quot; on Andalou&#x27;s website. VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
