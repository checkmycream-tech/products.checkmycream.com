      <li>It smells great and it does not have all the harmful chemicals that normal perfumes contain.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available on amazon.</li>
      <li>I used to wear One Love in my 20&#x27;s and always had such great complimemts.</li>
      <li>This scent is wonderful...not too strong so that others are overpowered even after you leave the room.  </li>
      <li>Nice oil, good applicator, I receive compliments from teen girls</li>
      <li>This might be too sweet for most adults</li>
      <li>I tend to go for more &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scents and can&#x27;t stand flowery or citrusy sweet smells.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok just overwhelmingly sweet.</li>
      <li>This super satisfied.</li>
      <li>Just took a chance on this after reading such great reviews.</li>
      <li>When I saw 4.99 per bottle for S&amp;H I had a fit and almost cancelled the order...</li>
      <li>Because I liked it so much she bought me a bottle</li>
      <li>Everyone wears scents differently but this is great on me.</li>
      <li>Fresh, clean and so lovely and feminine....</li>
      <li>The scent is so light but distinct, I get compliments on it all the time!</li>
      <li>It would probably be a great first perfume for a young girl as well.</li>
      <li>I love this oil, my new favorite</li>
      <li>You still need to be friendly and out going .</li>
      <li>Sweet, but clean.</li>
      <li>Sweet, musky, and clean.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this product because I had a large bottle not roll on and assumed it would smells as lovely.  </li>
      <li>This perfume smells like a very sweet amaretto at first.</li>
      <li>but 1 is ok for bottle and fast shipping</li>
      <li>It is my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>Wish it was a tad bit stronger but not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this and other products by Auric Blends and everyone has been happy with their choices.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
      <li>This particular scent, One Love, is a blend of cherry and vanilla.</li>
      <li>I gave 3 stars because I use it after my shower at night and the scent is super calming and sleep inducing.</li>
      <li>Fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;Fit</li>
      <li>I have never found a perfume or fragrance that I&#x27;ve liked enough to wear.</li>
      <li>Lovely scent, hard to describe, it just smells so nice and clean.</li>
      <li>The oils dont smell nearly as strong as the bottles that I get directly from auric blends.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, lasts in my skin, you just need to use a little bit.</li>
      <li>I chose this product because it smell phenomenal and the scent actually lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to women who love the smell of sugar cookies or to those who have younger daughters.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just took a chance on this after reading such great reviews. Just like beauty, scent is subjective!  This fragrance smells like b.o. in a bottle to me, but others may find it to smell great!  Also, it was probably just my body chemistry that made it smell not so great. Either way try it yourself because it was probably just me!</li>
    <li> Best smell ever and last all day. I bought this from New Mexico years ago. Finally found it again here. This is the best sent I&#x27;ve tried from this brand.</li>
    <li> Smells good, lasts in my skin, you just need to use a little bit.</li>
    <li> I used to get these oils when i was younger and i never received a bad word about how i smelled, it was opposite in fact, and i was told maaaany times how i smelled like candy and fruit and people couldn&#x27;t get enough of it, this is the fragrance i started with and it has a fruit/sweet smelling fragrance to it and maybe a hint of vanilla, the thing about these oils is they last for eternity and smell a little different on everyone, wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is a good product and I got the item within a few days. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Due to the reviews I was expecting more. This oil smells great, however on the smell scale of 1 to 10 its a 3 and it does not last long. I contacted the seller to see to see if my bottle was old but did not hear back. I gave 3 stars because I use it after my shower at night and the scent is super calming and sleep inducing.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells great and it does not have all the harmful chemicals that normal perfumes contain.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, my new favorite</li>
    <li> my daughter-in-law loves this so I thought I&#x27;d get her several vials.  When I saw 4.99 per bottle for S&amp;H I had a fit and almost cancelled the order... but I decided to just get 1.</li>
    <li> Lovely smell. Wish it was a tad bit stronger but not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I used to wear One Love in my 20&#x27;s and always had such great complimemts. I have since moved amd haven&#x27;t been able to find tjis scent anywhere until now. Only took a few days to arrive in the mail. My 7 yr old asked to smell it and he thought it was awesome. He likes it cuz it smells like candy lol. The smell always changes. Somerimes it&#x27;s cherry or vanilla or cotton candy. My son said it smelled like bubble gum. This might be too sweet for most adults but I love it. It would probably be a great first perfume for a young girl as well.</li>
    <li> Really feminine.  This scent is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product, the scent only lasts about 30 minutes. I also have the black opium oil from Auric Blends and it lasts all day. Would not recommend nut purchase again.</li>
    <li> I usually wear strong, citrus perfumes but now that it&#x27;s autumn, I wanted something softer. I smelled this at a local store and bought it right away. One Love is sweet, happy and comforting, like a warm hug!</li>
    <li> Nice oil, good applicator, I receive compliments from teen girls (I&#x27;m an adult) on the scent.</li>
    <li> This is my biggest disappointment online. For oil perfume there is almost no smell after opening. After applying during 1 min. there is nothing. And imagine I bought 2, because postage was expensive.. So I got 2 useless bottles anticipating they will smear me with beautiful odour. My first and last bought. Very disappointed. More bad  joke then a serious deal from producer.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Sweet, musky, and clean.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is such a soft, light blend of essential oils that everyone has complimented me on.  I have used it for over 5 years.  I&#x27;ve recommended this and other products by Auric Blends and everyone has been happy with their choices.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, I use to buy it all the time at a health food store but they never have it anymore.  Glad I can find it here.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil! The scent is so light but distinct, I get compliments on it all the time! Because its an oil, the fragrance is long lasting. The bottle last a long time and this is all that I wear. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have never found a perfume or fragrance that I&#x27;ve liked enough to wear. I tend to go for more &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scents and can&#x27;t stand flowery or citrusy sweet smells. This is the one and only fragrance I&#x27;ve ever felt crazy about and I get compliments constantly about it. Lasts most of the day when applied to wrists and neck. Have also tried their Egyptian Goddess roller but it&#x27;s a bit too musky and spicy for me.  Love is similar to straight up white amber oil, but not as sharp and musky on your nose.  I hope they keep making it because I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do otherwise!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t smell a thing with this oil. It has absolutely no scent to me. Shipping was fast, but for all I know, this could be a bottle of cooking oil.  I definitely will NOT be purchasing this fragrance again.</li>
    <li> I never wore perfume oil before but this one is an A++++ I found this originally in a small shop in my town, and fell in love with it. They only had one left and are closing so I had to look elsewhere to purchase more. Thank God for Amazon. It smells amazing, and I get compliments on it a lot when I wear it. It is my favorite thing :) I had no problems purchasing it on here, it came through the mail on time, and was packaged very well so the bottles did not break or get damaged. I would totally recommend this to everyone. If you&#x27;re looking to try something new. Try this!</li>
    <li> I love this roll on. It has a gentle, pleasant smell and fits nicely in my purse :)</li>
    <li> This scent is really nice!</li>
    <li> This smells so delicious. It is my absolute favorite. My husband loves it as well.</li>
    <li> Everyone wears scents differently but this is great on me. It&#x27;s a soft romantic fragrance....love most all the Auric blends!</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the roll-on feature.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent EVER. Not too overpowering, but lasts ALL day and EVERYONE can smell it. It&#x27;s my little secret!!!</li>
    <li> All Im gonna say is Ladies the day I 1st put it on... it was non-stop compliments mostly men but from women that day and every time I use it... just do not rub it on hard as it alters the scent by doing so</li>
    <li> Love this I want more xoxo</li>
    <li> The oils dont smell nearly as strong as the bottles that I get directly from auric blends.  I&#x27;m not sure if its because the oils have been dilluted or if they are extremely old or have been heated, but the scent just isn&#x27;t frangrant at all. I&#x27;m sad.</li>
    <li> Everyone loves it. It&#x27;s a perfect essential oil blend - not overpowering &amp; beautifully scented. I wear it all the time - it&#x27;s my signature scent. I&#x27;ve given it as gifts to several people. It&#x27;s truly amazing!</li>
    <li> Loved the smell when smelling it out of the bottle.  Not so much after hours of wear.  Don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok just overwhelmingly sweet. Maybe that&#x27;s just because I like softer scents. I feel like this scent is best for someone between the ages of 10-13</li>
    <li> Of the many perfumes with pheromones I&#x27;ve used both as expensive and more economical. This has been one of the most effective and excellent results. The scent is sensual, the base oil is more durable and my husband gets crazy ... crazy. This super satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd favorite scent next to Egyptian Goddess. Lovely scent, hard to describe, it just smells so nice and clean. Not overpowering at all. I always get compliments on this!!</li>
    <li> Lovely oil. Smells so good that people ask about it all the time</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, very hard to fun in stores anymore. This product I have used for years, could buy in stores locally, then they removed it only place to buy</li>
    <li> I always have gotten compliments when wearing this..I just wish it came in a larger volume because I go through it so quickly</li>
    <li> This\\&quot;One Love - Auric Blends Perfume Oil\\&quot; stinks like cherry juice, cherry flavor gum chew, cherry flavor lollipop don&#x27;t know how to explain this cherry fruit flavor.. but terrible smell stinks.... ignore to buy this \\&quot;One Love - Auric Blends Perfume Oil\\&quot; waste of money... Burns under arms very badly if you apply under arms or anywhere over your body (even I applied on Tshirt that Tshirt wet oil touch my body burns there badly).&lt;br /&gt;I planned to give 0star but 1 is ok for bottle and fast shipping and as I am regular customer of this product sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-HP</li>
    <li> new to me...love this one as well</li>
    <li> Alluring and soft scent</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift, she loved it.</li>
    <li> wife speaking i love this scent!</li>
    <li> Lovely scent; however, the concentration of fragrance in the oil was so light that it was barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> Could barely smell it, and what WAS there faded within minutes.  But the faint whiff I got was kind of nice.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it smell phenomenal and the scent actually lasts for hours. The roll on is very convenient to as you can put it on anywhere. Also its not greasy or messy. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This scent is wonderful...not too strong so that others are overpowered even after you leave the room.  It is lvely and is best for close quarters.</li>
    <li> I bought a vial of this perfume from a local shop after falling in love with the incense of the same name. This perfume smells like a very sweet amaretto at first. It then fades to a vanilla smell with a hint of bitter wood to it. It absorbs quickly into the skin. It is not greasy once absorbed and the smell lasts a long time. I would recommend this to women who love the smell of sugar cookies or to those who have younger daughters.</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful scent! Fresh, clean and so lovely and feminine....Love is Auric Blends&#x27; top seller (along with Egyptian Goddess) and should be a staple in every millennium girl&#x27;s perfume collection.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;Fit for spring&lt;br /&gt;Its not over powering, but you can definitely know that the scent is there.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite scent. I can&#x27;t get enough of this oil. I can no longer find it locally so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available on amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a joke and my friend and I put it on to test it on 5 different nights out . The strange  thing is each time we went out we had &amp;#34;mult &amp;#34; men around us flirting and dancing with use . Now I normally don&#x27;t believe in this type of thing ... But it is strange . Now my friend won&#x27;t go out without putting some on. I still wear my favorite perfume ... But I rub this behind the ear or between the breast ... Test it your self ... You still need to be friendly and out going .</li>
    <li> Smells great. Very light scent. Not over whelming at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my absolutely favorite scent. and I get so many complements when I wear it.  Technically classified as a musk,  the powdery musk smell is barely noticeable. It is a lightly sweet and very clean smell that doesn&#x27;t smell heavy at all, even when i load it on. These perfume oils definitely change as you wear them. I&#x27;ve tried the majority of the Auric Blends oils and this one is by far the best one.</li>
    <li> I truly like this smell a lot and love the way it lasts ALL day! A little goes a long way though, keep that in mind!</li>
    <li> This is the 4th time I&#x27;ve bought these perfumed oils.  I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells and oils but these are great!</li>
    <li> Love this scent, but it has become difficult to purchase locally, so I buy it online now. All of the Auric Blends are amazing...they last a long time and are very pleasant scents, not overwhelming. Anyone close to you can smell it, but you don&#x27;t overwhelm a room with your perfume, which I like...you can&#x27;t really use too much of it. They also do not irritate my skin like some perfumes do. I also add the oils to unscented lotion. This particular scent, One Love, is a blend of cherry and vanilla. Very yummy scent. Sweet, but clean. Can&#x27;t beat the price, either.</li>
    <li> This scent is just amazing!</li>
    <li> I really like the unisex fragrance...Definitely a staple scent to add to your oil collection.</li>
    <li> Just the gift she wanted.  Excellent surprise for her.  We will order this product again.  One big win for me!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent oil by auric blends! the drydown reminds me of the original Jovan Musk OIl for women from the 1970&#x27;s it is also very long lasting. I love it</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s girlfriend uses the Auric blends, specifically Egyptian Goddess and I can always smell her coming into a room. Because I liked it so much she bought me a bottle and it prompted me to also order &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; by Auric. I have to say I cannot, nor can anyone else smell it on me. I apply it numerous times and there is hardly any scent. I hope the Auric people can speak to this because I&#x27;m not the only one with this complaint. From what I understand, the scents used to be stronger. This says to me that the company is skimping on the ingrediants and it&#x27;s affecting their product. Not good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I had a large bottle not roll on and assumed it would smells as lovely.  It smessled like cherries, its ok it I was at a beach.  I live in Alaska and the cherry scent wasn&#x27;t really working.  Will give to my niece who lives in California.  I have had other scents from Auric Blends but, this one was not a hit.</li>
