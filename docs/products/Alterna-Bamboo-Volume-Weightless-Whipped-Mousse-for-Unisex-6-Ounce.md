      <li>I like this product because it does not weigh down my fine hair and it has a nice smell.  </li>
      <li>mousse is light and creamy; and while that&#x27;s a good thing if I were eating it, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s what I want in my hair</li>
      <li>This mousse gives volume without weighing the hair down - weightless is a good description.  </li>
      <li>Super fast shipping and as described.</li>
      <li>Nice volume, not too much but just enough.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this product is the only one that I found that truely gives volume and fullness.  </li>

      <li>I will for sure use this route in the future again!</li>

      <li>It is weightless and soft.</li>
      <li>Very light mousse adds decent volume to my thin hair.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t seem to style it right with this product, and do not really like the texture it leaves in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much, you only need a little especially if your hair is fine.</li>
      <li>I have &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; straight hair with little &amp;#34;body.&amp;#34;  This product really helps to give some volume.</li>
      <li>I rated it high because it also is long lasting and does not dull my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine but very thick and much curlier in the back than the front.</li>
      <li>Not cheap but worth it.</li>

    <li> I love this product.  Great for fine textured hair.  Delivered promptly</li>
    <li> Like the nice fragrance. Very light mousse adds decent volume to my thin hair.</li>
    <li> excellent  product, very refreshing, I would not use any other.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and this product is the best for it!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it so limp.</li>
    <li> I have truly fine hair and this product is great.</li>
    <li> There are several different lines of this product, and I was told to seek out the Pomegranate, but then during my research found out the Bamboo was what I really wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I went to Ulta to look for it and they had all the other lines, but only one of the three of the Bamboo I wanted, so I came home and ordered them through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The mousse is light and creamy; and while that&#x27;s a good thing if I were eating it, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s what I want in my hair, i.e., the creaminess.&lt;br /&gt;It added some body to my hair, but nothing so wonderful I have to shout it from the roof top.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? No. For the price, I expected more and didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Not only does this not give my hair volume, it leaves it static!! In 90 degree heat and humidity I have flyaway hair!! WTF??!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering the Alterna Bamboo Volume Weightless Whipped Mousse 6oz (whew!) for approx. four months now.  My orders have been very good, the same product as in the Salon. So order with confidence.  Plus when I use my Amazon Prime, no additional shipping!  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> love this mouse it works perfectly for styling my hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this product is the only one that I found that truely gives volume and fullness.  I have tried everything out there from drug store varieties to boutique brands.  This is the best!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good mousse for the extra volume, I apply it at hair roots at places that I want more volume after wash and they lift my roots without causing a lot of stickiness. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Hi! Love the brand good mousse.</li>
    <li> Very light and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue feeling on hair.  Gives my hair lots of body.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  I have &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; straight hair with little &amp;#34;body.&amp;#34;  This product really helps to give some volume.</li>
    <li> This does seem to increase my hair&#x27;s volume but I can&#x27;t seem to style it right with this product, and do not really like the texture it leaves in my hair.  I have fine wavy hair, and can&#x27;t seem to get it to straighten or curl better than with just some Giovanni brand mousse.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mousse for some time. I have very short, thick hair so have a hard time finding a worthy product. This Bamboo mousse is awesome with hold, scent and price. Delivery was fast and issue-free. I will definitely keep using!</li>
    <li> Have used this for several years and continue to love the volume it gives my hair. Keeps hair feeling clean send I have very oily hair!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it says it is. Weightless and adds great volume to fine hair. I love it. Will be purchasing more and will pass it on to friends.</li>
    <li> Great product if you need volume.</li>
    <li> Great- first time going thru Amazon and working w/this company. Had absolutely no Hassel and everything went as I was told it would! TY! I will for sure use this route in the future again! Cheapest shipping charges and taxes I could find as well!!</li>
    <li> I purchased six of the top volumizers on amazon based on reviews, in as small packages as I could get because I wanted to find the best.  This was the best out of all of them.  Love the smell, gives TONS of volume all day into the next day, doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily like the other volumizers did.  Will only purchase this volumizer going forward.</li>
    <li> I love all Alterna Products, and this one is no exception.  Really works great, gives hair volume, and holds all day!</li>
    <li> Always use this mousse....have tried others but just love this one.  Your hair smells so good after you have blown dried it!  Great mousse, great price!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really keeps my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to it. It felt nice but my head started to itch.  The texture was nice but I did have the allergy problem.</li>
    <li> This mousse gives volume without weighing the hair down - weightless is a good description.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I love this mousse! I rec&#x27;d this shortly after ordering it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with EVO Liquid Rollers for a couple of years. My former housekeeper who used to do hair recommended them for my hair. My hair is fine but very thick and much curlier in the back than the front. I use the Liquid Rollers on the curlier part of my hair and the Bamboo Mousse on the front. Don&#x27;t use too much, you only need a little especially if your hair is fine. I truly love both of them for smell and what they do for my hair. They also both keep my hair shiny with no buildup. I am very picky about ingredients so wanted something without questionable ingredients.</li>
    <li> Not much volume. It is weightless and soft. But doesn&#x27;t do much for my fine, limp hair.</li>
    <li> Alterna has continued to change their product line up and discontinue the products that are the most effective for fine hair.  This is the replacement for the Alterna Caviar Non-Aerosol Mousse.  It&#x27;s not a good replacement.  It does not have the same lift and hold.  It is more volume than drying your hair without product, but that is it.  You can get the same volume without the $32 price tag at Target or WalMart.  It has that \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; smell that is Alterna&#x27;s signature.  I also felt like dry time was longer with this product.</li>
    <li> This mousse provides lift and shine to my fine hair.  Never in my many years and multiple products has anything worked so well.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love alterna products and I wanted to love this.  It did work.  I had volume.  But unlike the more discrete, unisex scents I&#x27;m used to in the Bamboo *Smoothing* line, this product smelled strongly of men&#x27;s cologne to the degree it gave me a headache.  It also felt like buildup on my hair, and on Day 2 after washing and using this product, my hair actually looked greasy.  I don&#x27;t want to have to wash my hair every single day so I can use a smelly mousse.  I&#x27;m not impressed and will not be using this again.  Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and as described.</li>
    <li> great  volume ability; works the best adding after root boost and 95% drying done, then apply to just needed areas and blow dry</li>
    <li> I love this mousse.  It gives my hair so much volume and body.  Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive everywhere I find it.</li>
    <li> This Mousse is GREAT!  I&#x27;ve used it for quite awhile and the results are perfect.  I would recommend this Seller.</li>
    <li> I love alterna. Excellent product</li>
    <li> Works ok, but the smell bothers me. I have chemical sensitivity, so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t bother others. But to me it was very strong and smelled like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> Very good and delivered to me very fast thank you</li>
    <li> Nice volume, not too much but just enough.</li>
    <li> This mousse is very good love it gives hair a lot of volume and the hair is not sticky feeling  smooth feeling  its good.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product as are all of the Alterna products. Not cheap but worth it.</li>
    <li> Great item - fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it does not weigh down my fine hair and it has a nice smell.  This does not have a perfume smell as some seem to have.  I rated it high because it also is long lasting and does not dull my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse. Holds well giving hair fullness.</li>
    <li> Amazing and worth the cost</li>
    <li> nice and smooth not stickey</li>
</ol>
