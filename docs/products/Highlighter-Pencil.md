      <li>great product!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product!  </li>
      <li>Having a fat pencil like this is a brilliant way to apply highlighter!</li>
      <li>and I use a very good primer.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
      <li>Works great on blemishes, but does not provide great coverage for under your eyes.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite highlighting pencil!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I like it BETTER than the liquid highlighter from a tube that I was using under my eyes!</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This highlighter is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>Does NOT settle into fine lines and wrinkles, lasts all day without being set, it is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>My opinion is they need to work on the formula, I&#x27;ve used a lot better ones.</li>
      <li>Both my daughter and I love this product.</li>
      <li>There is more control than with a foam tip applicator or a tube.</li>
      <li>I love this pencil.</li>
      <li>Truthfully I saw a Youtube video where someone used this product</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Not overly impressed, expected better for the price.</li>
      <li>Perfect for under my eyes to brighten those dark spots.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s definitely worth the money for me!</li>
      <li>I have to find a way to sharpen it without purchasing their special sharpener...sold separately.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s suppose to be great for coverage of dark circles, sun and age spots.</li>
      <li>Its easy to blend and can be used many different ways.  </li>
      <li>First purchase after a sample from Birch Box.</li>
      <li>First got it in my Birchbox.</li>
      <li>Got this in my first ipsy bag thank goodness.</li>
      <li>It really makes your eyebrows stand out and defines their shape.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very blendable and is very creamy.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found it does much for me</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>I have really dark circles under my eyes and have tried SO many products trying to cover/conceal the purple/pink circles.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>but I definitely can&#x27;t live without it now that I&#x27;ve discovered it.</li>
      <li>(YES, I am surprised!)</li>
      <li>I use it under my brow bones, the inner corners of my eyes, and anywhere I would normally use a concealer.</li>

<li> I did have a hard time finding a pencil sharpener large enough for the pencil.</li>
<li> It is all I expected and hoped it would be.</li>
<li> This was creamier than I expected.</li>
<li> All-in-all, I would definitely give this a try again…especially if it came it a slightly lighter color!</li>
<li> I figured I could at least use it in the inner corner of my eye and underline my lower lid, which it does with ease.  </li>
<li> $18 is a little steep</li>
<li> Texture is a little to chunky to blend well.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
<li> I use it down my nose, under my eyes and on my brow bone!</li>
<li> I used a small brush to spread it…</li>
<li> In the past, it&#x27;s been so hard finding a highlighter with coverage and brightening qualities.  </li>
<li> It goes on chalky for me and is hard to blend.</li>
<li> And now, if I wish to continue to use this product, (doubtful)  </li>

    <li> Love this! First got it in my Birchbox. Perfect for under my eyes to brighten those dark spots. I also use to cover up blemishes.</li>
    <li> This highlighter is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  In the past, it&#x27;s been so hard finding a highlighter with coverage and brightening qualities.  Not anymore! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It says its a higighter but it isn&#x27;t shimmery. I use it down my nose, under my eyes and on my brow bone! $18 is a little steep but I definitely can&#x27;t live without it now that I&#x27;ve discovered it.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It is all I expected and hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I love this product. You can literally highlight any area of your face. You can also use it as a cover-up.</li>
    <li> I love this pencil. Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and thrilled to find it on Amazon. I use for age spots, under eye circles etc. creamy and stays.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have really dark circles under my eyes and have tried SO many products trying to cover/conceal the purple/pink circles.  I received this in a Birchbox about a year ago and have only had to buy 2 replacements since.  So it&#x27;s definitely worth the money for me!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite highlighting pencil! I use it under my brow bones, the inner corners of my eyes, and anywhere I would normally use a concealer. It&#x27;s very blendable and is very creamy.</li>
    <li> I purchased after seeing it reviewed on TV several times by &amp;#34;beauty product experts&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s suppose to be great for coverage of dark circles, sun and age spots. I haven&#x27;t used it yet and will update my review once I do.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. If you are very big into filling in your eyebrows and eyes with eye shadow, this is the product for you. It really makes your eyebrows stand out and defines their shape. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I call this my \\&quot;crack\\&quot;. I got this in my IPSY bag and haven&#x27;t been without it since. I have 3 spares. I use it above the eye, under the eye, as a primer, as a shadow, as a nose highlight, cupids bow...everywhere. Does NOT settle into fine lines and wrinkles, lasts all day without being set, it is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I put it over my lids and it makes me look refreshed.  Its easy to blend and can be used many different ways.  over lid or under brow.  great product!!!</li>
    <li> First purchase after a sample from Birch Box. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Got this in my first ipsy bag thank goodness. I love this! I use it as a highlighter and concealer. I dab this on my blemishes, dust on some blush and mascara and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> Truthfully I saw a Youtube video where someone used this product so I bought it.  I haven&#x27;t found it does much for me but than I might not know how to apply it correctly.  Did it like the lady on the video but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Works great on blemishes, but does not provide great coverage for under your eyes.  Good product. I did have a hard time finding a pencil sharpener large enough for the pencil.</li>
    <li> My experience shows this is just too chalky for me. I tried it under the eyebrows and it clumped plus wouldn&#x27;t blend. My opinion is they need to work on the formula, I&#x27;ve used a lot better ones. My face is well moisturized and I use a very good primer.  It goes on chalky for me and is hard to blend. I figured I could at least use it in the inner corner of my eye and underline my lower lid, which it does with ease.  However, it&#x27;s gone within 30 minutes. Will not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Very diverse, I wear it everyday. It brightens up under my eyes, below my brow and makes my eyes pop when I apply it on my inner lids!</li>
    <li> Texture is a little to chunky to blend well.</li>
    <li> Not overly impressed, expected better for the price. And now, if I wish to continue to use this product, (doubtful)  I have to find a way to sharpen it without purchasing their special sharpener...sold separately.</li>
    <li> Having a fat pencil like this is a brilliant way to apply highlighter! There is more control than with a foam tip applicator or a tube. This was creamier than I expected. I used it to highlight under my eyebrows, under my eyes, above my cheekbones, on my chin, the middle of my forehead, etc….as you would use any highlighter. I used a small brush to spread it…I like it BETTER than the liquid highlighter from a tube that I was using under my eyes! (YES, I am surprised!) All-in-all, I would definitely give this a try again…especially if it came it a slightly lighter color!</li>
