      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;dry touch 100 SPF&amp;#34; from Neutrogena, and it is a very good product, but I really like Cotz face</li>
      <li>For those of you with sensitive skin who can&#x27;t wear chemical sunscreens, this product is the best.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, as far as SPF protection, this is awesome.</li>
      <li>I have very very sensitive fair skin as well as Rosacea, and this is great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been using the natural color version for a while, and LOVED the texture (a wonderful mattifying effect for my oily skin) and was ok with the light tint (made me look a bit healthier, some would say).  </li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and blends well.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This cream does not leave my skin oily looking, like most sunscreens would.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>and I really love Cotz Face Lighter Skin Tone.  </li>
      <li>I really love</li>
      <li>Even my physical therapist keeps telling me how wonderful my skin is.</li>
      <li>Smashbox is more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than this lotion.</li>
      <li>Best facial sunscreen to wear under makeup EVER!!  </li>
      <li>Love the feel.</li>
      <li>LOVE, love love this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the performance</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS SUNBLOCK THAT MY DERMATALOGIST RECOMMENDED ME.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, too many sunscreens and nothing works well under makeup, but this stuff just works.</li>
      <li>ordered because already using this product.  :-)</li>
      <li>and I love that it&#x27;s chemical-free.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and very light.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;lighter skin&amp;#34; formula is chalk white - but I am very fair and have not had a problem with it blending into my skin.</li>
      <li>by the way, it&#x27;s better than Solbar chemical free sunscreens, which I react to.</li>
      <li>As far as sun protection, this sunscreen works great</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get burned at all and the sunscreen feels really light and lovely on.  </li>
      <li>: makeup goes on more smoothly and pores are diminished.</li>
      <li>I love that this lotion goes an smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>Protects with zinc and provides a smooth, matte surface under makeup.</li>
      <li>It applys smoothly and absorbs immediately.  </li>
      <li>Chemical free</li>
      <li>goes on smooth and it s so light that its like not wearing any at all&lt;br /&gt;blends</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have unusually sensitive skin, then this probably would work for you and be a good product -</li>
      <li>Still, I thought a product advertised as being for &amp;#34;lighter skin tones&amp;#34; would be even better, since I&#x27;m pretty</li>
      <li>And my Rosacea prone skin (which I treat well with IPL) does not react to the Cotz face or the original SPF 58 Cotz.</li>
      <li>Even better, it does not have evident comedogenic ingredients and it does not break me out.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is good, but it is not for &amp;#34;lighter skin tone.&amp;#34;  Rather, it will turn any color face into a pasty white tone.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to have found a sunscreen that has natural protection and makes my complexion look better at the same time.</li>
      <li>, I would compare it to Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish Primer, which I also wear sometimes at night because just don&#x27;t need SPF in the dark, but honestly, I think this works even better.</li>
      <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>keeps you from burning, no reactions, blends well, it is my favorite by far.  </li>
      <li>Many cosmetics cause acne on my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I mix this one with the tinted Cotz to get the right color for my skin.</li>
      <li>, this is pretty good for sensitive skin (especially on the face).</li>
      <li>Funny thing is that every time when I apply the sunscreen, I always wash off the residue on my palm with soap, but my palm still feels greasy after the hand wash , and I always have to use a paper towel to wipe it off.    </li>
      <li>Texture is really stellar for oily folks though, almost like a mousse.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I have been looking for, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
      <li>but unfortunately, I&#x27;m not one of those people.</li>
      <li>Thanks to my dermatologist and your product my skin glows!</li>
      <li>I have tried many different sunscreens that claim to be matte, and then end up with a shiny complexion after applying.</li>
      <li>AND I HOPE TO ORDER MORE FROM YOU IN THE FUTURE AND ON FOREVER.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time on a two week trip to Hawaii.  </li>
      <li>Wearing foundation over it mutes that a bit, but I&#x27;d imagine it might be more obvious on skin tones darker than mine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve quite fair-skinned (porcelain), such that most foundations don&#x27;t even come in a color light enough for me.  </li>
      <li>Only face sunscreen I&#x27;ve found suitable for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Cotz face is like a soft primer-like mildly matte foundation.</li>
      <li>I had previously tried the tinted version of this product and liked it.</li>
      <li>I did not wear this into water, so I can&#x27;t speak to that, though I&#x27;d strongly recommend following the package directions in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best of all, it is a physical sunscreen, so I do not have to worry about the unknown long term effects of the chemical sunscreens.</li>
      <li>When I wear regular chemical-based sunscreens, they end up sliding down my face, especially in warm weather and leaves my eyes red and burny.</li>
      <li>The cost is pretty high</li>
      <li>Very whitening with no tint.</li>
      <li>Also, it protects very well, I do not get burned when wearing it hiking and stuff.</li>
      <li>I feel confident that I am covered, since I can see where I have put it before it sinks in.</li>
      <li>The tint was a bit darker than my skin, but when I put the product on, it really didn&#x27;t show.</li>
      <li>It mattifies my complexion instead of leaving it shiny like most other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried tend to do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for oily skin not so much for dry skin because it makes dry patches very obvious.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Wish the tube was bigger, but it&#x27;s still worth the price for the texture it leaves.</li>
      <li>The ONLY product I have found that is definitely matte and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>It *is possible* to produce a physical and makeup friendly sunscreen, so</li>
      <li>I moisturize first, then put this on, and it instantly mattifies my skin.</li>
      <li>The light tint help hide dark circles/redness.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin with a pink undertone to it, so the natural color is too dark for me, however, this one is white</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a bit difficult to rub into the skin, but it&#x27;s definitely a mattifying product, which is great for me since I am all about avoiding shine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unscented, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin or irritate it even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It does leave the white cast but rubs in well and is worth it considering it&#x27;s one of the only sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t contain irritants that may be harmful to people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I used both the lighter skin tone and the natural skin tone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen after having to return the Cotz Face tinted sunscreen because it was a little too dark for my ivory complexion. It goes on very smooth and blends well. It mattifies my complexion instead of leaving it shiny like most other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried tend to do. It also has a primer-like effect: makeup goes on more smoothly and pores are diminished. Though it blends well, it gives my skin a slightly lighter look because of the zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide. Wearing foundation over it mutes that a bit, but I&#x27;d imagine it might be more obvious on skin tones darker than mine. The tinted version of this product is called &#x27;Natural Skin Tone&#x27;. That sunscreen has the same consistency and primer effect as this one, but some tan color is added so it&#x27;s a little like wearing a foundation or tinted primer. The manufacturer told me the two versions can be mixed together if someone finds one too light and the other too dark. I don&#x27;t mind the lighter look because it&#x27;s very subtle and since I like to apply sunscreen to my neck, I don&#x27;t want to have to worry about color transferring to my clothing. As far as sun protection, this sunscreen works great and I love that it&#x27;s chemical-free. When I wear regular chemical-based sunscreens, they end up sliding down my face, especially in warm weather and leaves my eyes red and burny. I never have that problem with Cotz sunscreens which is one of the reasons I buy this brand. It&#x27;s unscented, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin or irritate it even though I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;m happy to have found a sunscreen that has natural protection and makes my complexion look better at the same time.</li>
    <li> Irritated my skin, made my eyes water too. If you don&#x27;t have unusually sensitive skin, then this probably would work for you and be a good product - but unfortunately, I&#x27;m not one of those people.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and very light.</li>
    <li> It is NOT non-comedogenic! I never get pimples except the five days I made the mistake of using this product! Very disappointed. But atleast they went away when I discontinued use.</li>
    <li> Wore it out to dinner and my son asked if I had mayo on my face...Not really the look I was going for...</li>
    <li> Protects with zinc and provides a smooth, matte surface under makeup.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen if you can use silicones.  I have been having a problem with my skin so I went off silicone which can cause clogged pores in some people.</li>
    <li> This goes on like a primer, but is a very effective sunblock. Hides pores and disguises tiny wrinkles, as well as mattifying my skin for makeup application. Wish the tube was bigger, but it&#x27;s still worth the price for the texture it leaves. Love it!</li>
    <li> This goes on smoothly, and is not too pale looking, once rubbed in.  I can put foundation over it without it being a drag on the sponge.  I feel confident that I am covered, since I can see where I have put it before it sinks in. It&#x27;s not pasty white, like some.  One tube lasts about a month and a half, used every day on my face and neck.  It&#x27;s a good value and a good product, with none of the chemicals to which I am allergic.</li>
    <li> The lighter skin tone sunscreen is actually white, so you still need a foundation over it.  I was trying to avoid using both, but need to anyway.  The good news is, it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I have very very sensitive fair skin as well as Rosacea, and this is great. I have fair skin with a pink undertone to it, so the natural color is too dark for me, however, this one is white (it fades if applied well), so I mix the two.  Cotz face is like a soft primer-like mildly matte foundation. It does have a primer effect to it where it lessens the appearance of pores. And my Rosacea prone skin (which I treat well with IPL) does not react to the Cotz face or the original SPF 58 Cotz. If you&#x27;re looking for a little glow and tint, use the original SPF 58 Cotz. My face doesn&#x27;t react to it either. Sometimes, I&#x27;ll combine this product with that one for a nice effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, it&#x27;s better than Solbar chemical free sunscreens, which I react to.</li>
    <li> Only face sunscreen I&#x27;ve found suitable for sensitive skin. Love the feel. Actually makes makeup go on smoother &amp; stay in place longer.</li>
    <li> This product does not cause my skin to break out. I mix this one with the tinted Cotz to get the right color for my skin. The ONLY product I have found that is definitely matte and goes on smoothly. I have tried many different sunscreens that claim to be matte, and then end up with a shiny complexion after applying.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all. Chemical free so it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog the pores. Matte look.&lt;br /&gt;Feels silky.</li>
    <li> I had previously tried the tinted version of this product and liked it. The tint was a bit darker than my skin, but when I put the product on, it really didn&#x27;t show. Still, I thought a product advertised as being for &amp;#34;lighter skin tones&amp;#34; would be even better, since I&#x27;m pretty pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit surprised to see that this was totally white. And it does leave a little (not much) residue on your skin, which lightens your skin tone a little. So this definitely won&#x27;t work for everyone. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re going to put foundation makeup on top of this, the slight extra bit of whiteness will not even show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit difficult to rub into the skin, but it&#x27;s definitely a mattifying product, which is great for me since I am all about avoiding shine. I like the finish this leaves on my skin. I generally work it into my skincare routine after moisturizing but before my foundation primer and foundation. It doesn&#x27;t interfere at all with makeup application, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is pretty good for sensitive skin (especially on the face). Since the only sunscreen ingredients are mineral (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide), this should be less likely to cause an allergic or sensitivity reaction. I did not wear this into water, so I can&#x27;t speak to that, though I&#x27;d strongly recommend following the package directions in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the performance and I&#x27;d consider getting this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> keeps you from burning, no reactions, blends well, it is my favorite by far.  The only one that doesn&#x27;t give me pimples.</li>
    <li> I adore the tinted version, but it is just a bit dark in winter. (Although I wear it every time I am exposed to sunlight, I guess a color a bit anyway in summer.) This provides non-irritating, all-day, water-resistant protect, that is matte and invisible. It also doubles as a great makeup primer. I use it on my sensitive eyelids with no issues, and my makeup lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Best facial sunscreen to wear under makeup EVER!!  For those of you with sensitive skin who can&#x27;t wear chemical sunscreens, this product is the best.  Work it into the skin and your makeup applies over it beautifully.</li>
    <li> Really good sun protection while being a great primer under your maake up.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the versions. I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;dry touch 100 SPF&amp;#34; from Neutrogena, and it is a very good product, but I really like Cotz face the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the Midwest recently. All the ladies around me were drenched in the humidity. My face, with Cotz FACE, was matte during the entire stay.  I got compliments and asked for my &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34;, which I always share.</li>
    <li> I love that this lotion goes an smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> Stayed on and protected in the blazing sun at an outdoor comedy festival for 3 hours. Not greasy, but can feel mask like once you start sweating a lot. Very whitening with no tint. Texture is really stellar for oily folks though, almost like a mousse. Can be worn under makeup without balling up.</li>
    <li> I assumed that &amp;#34;Lighter Skin Tone&amp;#34; simply meant a lighter shade tint.  No, this is an ordinary untainted sunscreen.  It goes on nicely, and is not objectionable, but it is not what the name implies.</li>
    <li> It met every expectation after reading the reviews.  It applys smoothly and absorbs immediately.  It is a bit difficult to wash off your hands but with a lot a soap it is not a problem  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> A very nice sunscreen for fair skin.  This cream does not leave my skin oily looking, like most sunscreens would.</li>
    <li> Great makeup primer!!</li>
    <li> LOVE, love love this stuff. Exactly what I have been looking for, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. The light tint help hide dark circles/redness. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> It does work.  However, after using it for 2 or 3 months, I feel it is bit dry for my facial skin.  It I do not have enough skin cream on my face, my skin feels a little tingling pain after I apply the cream.  The pain will be gone in a few seconds. Funny thing is that every time when I apply the sunscreen, I always wash off the residue on my palm with soap, but my palm still feels greasy after the hand wash , and I always have to use a paper towel to wipe it off.    Update: 1/17/15    The cream is too dry.  I started to have deeper wrinkles around my eyes and on my  face.  I was not sure if it was my face wash or this cream.  After I stopped using this cream, I can feel my face is not so dry, and the wrinkles under my eyes are not so pronounced.  So I switch to Blue Lizard sensitive skin sunscreen.  At least my skin does not feel pain when apply the new sunscreen  and wrinkles are less.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time on a two week trip to Hawaii.  Didn&#x27;t get burned at all and the sunscreen feels really light and lovely on.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SUNBLOCK THAT MY DERMATALOGIST RECOMMENDED ME. I CANNOT FIND IT IN ANY STORE OR PHARMACY. BUT I DESPERATELY NEED IT. EVER SINCE I BEGAN USING THIS PRODUCT , I DONT EVEN NEED TO WEAR ANY MAKE-UP. THANK YOU AND I HOPE TO ORDER MORE FROM YOU IN THE FUTURE AND ON FOREVER. THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  My dermatologist thought my skin looked great after 4 months of the beach every day!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is good, but it is not for &amp;#34;lighter skin tone.&amp;#34;  Rather, it will turn any color face into a pasty white tone.  If you have even a bit of color in your face, I suggest getting the natural skin tone color version of this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> ordered because already using this product.  :-)</li>
    <li> goes on smooth and it s so light that its like not wearing any at all&lt;br /&gt;blends in great with my very fair complexion</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great and fills awesome. It&#x27;s great for oily skin not so much for dry skin because it makes dry patches very obvious. It does leave the white cast but rubs in well and is worth it considering it&#x27;s one of the only sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t contain irritants that may be harmful to people with sensitive skin. The cost is pretty high so I only use this sunscreen under makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but it goes on like a dry lotion. I moisturize first, then put this on, and it instantly mattifies my skin. Then I put on liquid foundation and no longer need to wear powder over it because my face is already matte. I LOVE IT. I even wear it when I go out at night because it works so well - in that sense, I would compare it to Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish Primer, which I also wear sometimes at night because just don&#x27;t need SPF in the dark, but honestly, I think this works even better. Smashbox is more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than this lotion. The &amp;#34;lighter skin&amp;#34; formula is chalk white - but I am very fair and have not had a problem with it blending into my skin. I pat it all over my face first and then go from there because it is hard to spread otherwise. Also, it protects very well, I do not get burned when wearing it hiking and stuff.</li>
    <li> Love it. I used both the lighter skin tone and the natural skin tone. I stocked these 2 items up just in case. Best sunscreen ever.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, too many sunscreens and nothing works well under makeup, but this stuff just works. Even better, it does not have evident comedogenic ingredients and it does not break me out. Many cosmetics cause acne on my sensitive skin and it is difficult to find something that does not make the problem worst. Best of all, it is a physical sunscreen, so I do not have to worry about the unknown long term effects of the chemical sunscreens. It *is possible* to produce a physical and makeup friendly sunscreen, so I am just wondering why this product is the only one that I could find with such features.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Goes on like silk.</li>
    <li> I have very pale skin, but found that even with such a pale complexion, the lotion was visible as a diffuse white powder over my entire face after an afternoon jog. I had wondered why people were staring at me half-way through my run. I have returned to using my prior sunscreen. On the pro side, there is great SPF coverage- I ran 10 miles through the desert and did not burn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve quite fair-skinned (porcelain), such that most foundations don&#x27;t even come in a color light enough for me.  I&#x27;d been using the natural color version for a while, and LOVED the texture (a wonderful mattifying effect for my oily skin) and was ok with the light tint (made me look a bit healthier, some would say).  I jumped on the chance to try this version, but I found it quite different.  The color is just white (not tinted at all), and when put on, it you can see a white film on the face (even at my shade!).  This absorbs, but it still lightens the visage somewhat.  After putting on some mineral foundation, it&#x27;s not as noticeable.  However, this also doesn&#x27;t the same mattifying effect of the natural shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I&#x27;ll stick with the natural shade (which is surprisingly less noticeable after it sets).  Nevertheless, as far as SPF protection, this is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using the remainder of this lighter one by mixing it in my palm with a foundations shade too dark for me to create a sort of tinted moisturizer w/ SPF.</li>
    <li> I really love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 75 and I really love Cotz Face Lighter Skin Tone.  It goes on so smooth and makes my skin feel great.  Even my physical therapist keeps telling me how wonderful my skin is. Thanks to my dermatologist and your product my skin glows!</li>
