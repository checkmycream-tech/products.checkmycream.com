      <li>Since I found this, I easily get the salon blowout look quickly and easily!</li>
      <li>This iron is for someone with extremely fine, wispy hair.  </li>
      <li>I do have fine to medium hair but lots of it.</li>
      <li>Cheap irons have the on/off switches in places where when you use them, you end up shutting them off without knowing it.</li>
      <li>i was so excited to get this product.</li>
      <li>The ferrum iron is definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>If you want quick results that DO NOT damage your hair, but make it look great, all day long, get this unique flatiron.</li>
      <li>I had been using the old version of this iron and liked it a lot.  </li>

      <li>I also use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny Serum and Seal and Shine.  </li>
      <li>I finally found the perfect flat iron.  </li>
      <li>But this new version is even better.  </li>
      <li>Not anymore thanks to my Ferrum!!</li>
      <li>it works at best for moderate curls in a dry climate.</li>
      <li>Ineffective overpriced product worth of $40.</li>
      <li>but well worth it for the quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>This iron has the switches in the right places, and it heats up quickly and hot.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it straightens my hair (natural hair) without burning it straight.  </li>
      <li>The Ferrum flat iron is exactly what I needed to achieve the results of a great flat iron but without the worry of damaging my hair.  </li>
      <li>Invest instead in to Argan Oil and big velcro rolls to attain healthy shine and volume.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for safer products for my family, so I am grateful for this item and am willing to pay a premium for my families safety and health.</li>
      <li>This iron does exactly as promised.  </li>
      <li>Those with courser hair may need to just use a higher setting.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>LOVE this flat iron, glides through my hair like silk and that is what my hair feels like.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron!  </li>
      <li>This flat iron will probably work better on hair that is somewhat straight.</li>
      <li>because I don&#x27;t like the pin straight effect I get with most irons, but the Ferrum Iron is a tool I use on a regular basis and has made my hair routine so much</li>
      <li>I am very particular with what I use on my hair.  </li>
      <li>It has body and stays frizz free until the next wash.</li>
      <li>The combination of the ceramic and fabric really puts my mind at ease and doesn&#x27;t damage the hair, and I am left with smooth, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I blow my hair out with a big brush for body, then straighten and smooth the ends.</li>
      <li>I have to say really does look darling.</li>
      <li>Wow!!!</li>
      <li>then I used the flat iron and it worked fantastic.  </li>
      <li>the fabric is exactly as described - which means it heads up on one side but the other side is a smooth fabric with no heat.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I  have purchased so many new styling tools trying to give life to my fine,thin, limp hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had for one week, but so far LOVE this Flat Iron.  </li>
      <li>The thing I like most about this iron is that when I am done, my hair doesn&#x27;t look stiff.</li>
      <li>From past uses of other types of flat irons this is the best by far.</li>
      <li>These flat irons take some getting used to, but they are definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>After blow drying it, the ferrum iron is able to completely rid my hair of frizz and those little ridges that I just can&#x27;t seem to get out with a hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>When my flat iron died, the company&#x27;s customer service department responded to my e-mail within an hour and shipped another one right away, no questions asked.</li>
      <li>but I highly recommend it for girls trying to manage thicker hair but still want a natural looking end result.</li>
      <li>They may make your hair look okay at first but later on its lifeless and limp!</li>
      <li>When she first got it, she was playing with it and said it actually smoothed her hair without being plugged in.</li>
      <li>My hair felt soft and silky to the touch!</li>
      <li>DIDN&#x27;T GET HOT ENOUGH FOR ME</li>
      <li>The Ferrum flat iron is nice to my hair, smoothing it without burning it, denting it, or making it too limp.</li>
      <li>but instead of waiting 1-2 days for it to naturally settle and become less \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;, I can use the Ferrum to tame, shape and smooth my hair and give it a more blown out look immediately after washing.</li>
      <li>My hair is just wavy, not super curly, so I can speak to how it will work with curlier hair, but it has a temp control and my hair ends up looking smooth and polished and certainly not dried out or over-used.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair smooth without flattening it, with little or no damage.  </li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t owned a hair iron since I was about 14 years old</li>
      <li>and I suspected it was from increased use of my OLD flatiron</li>
      <li>If you want smooth silky results without stiff, brunt hair</li>
      <li>After reading really favorable reviews about this flat iron, I decided to order one for myself.</li>
      <li>It is very different from any flat iron I have owned in the past as it does not give you a stick straight look but rather more body.</li>
      <li>so I prefer to let it air dry without applying too much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but lets be real, no pain no gain; no proper heat no proper straightening.</li>
      <li>What happens is you get all the heat to your hair without the overkill of having a hot plate on the other side.</li>
      <li>I expected it to be gentle</li>
      <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t work so well for my kinky natural hair.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for the pin straight look of a typical hair iron this is not for you</li>
      <li>flat iron gets the job done after I blow dry my 3c 4a natural hair.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a professional flat iron that would flatten my hair and yet still have body, fullness and wouldn&#x27;t dry out and damage my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> From past uses of other types of flat irons this is the best by far. No burned, crispy, fried ends. Hair felt good and with volume. It was kind of like a blow out</li>
    <li> I have very thick and curly hair.  After blow drying it, the ferrum iron is able to completely rid my hair of frizz and those little ridges that I just can&#x27;t seem to get out with a hair dryer.  I absolutely love it, and their customer service is incredible.  The ferrum iron is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> If you want quick results that DO NOT damage your hair, but make it look great, all day long, get this unique flatiron.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! I&#x27;m at totally impressed and it takes A LOT for a hair product or tool to truly impress me!! Let me start of by saying that I HATE traditional flat irons!! They bake and flatten as well as damage hair! They may make your hair look okay at first but later on its lifeless and limp! Your ends look bad even if you have healthy hair with regular flat irons too! Not anymore thanks to my Ferrum!! This is like a magic wand for beautiful salon blowout hair! That&#x27;s the look I prefer but it hurts my arm to blow out my hair with a brush and dryer! Since I found this, I easily get the salon blowout look quickly and easily! I get compliments all the time now because my hair looks healthier and has life!! Thank you Ferrum!! They have the BEST customer service on the planet! So, AMAZING product with the BEST customer service and company!! You can&#x27;t go wrong!Thank you Ferrum from the bottom of my heart for saving my wedding day in more than one way!! Thank you!! Thank you! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her flat iron. When she first got it, she was playing with it and said it actually smoothed her hair without being plugged in. I am always looking for safer products for my family, so I am grateful for this item and am willing to pay a premium for my families safety and health.</li>
    <li> After reading really favorable reviews about this flat iron, I decided to order one for myself. My hairdresser had just commented on my ends getting dry and I suspected it was from increased use of my OLD flatiron, so I was attracted to this one and the fabric feature. the fabric is exactly as described - which means it heads up on one side but the other side is a smooth fabric with no heat. This gives me  confidence that I am not burning my hair, and in fact it feels like I am making it stronger and healthier. My hair is just wavy, not super curly, so I can speak to how it will work with curlier hair, but it has a temp control and my hair ends up looking smooth and polished and certainly not dried out or over-used. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love It.  Wish it had auto shut off.</li>
    <li> I have had this iron for a while now and I am never going back. If you want smooth silky results without stiff, brunt hair this is what you need. The thing I like most about this iron is that when I am done, my hair doesn&#x27;t look stiff. It has body and stays frizz free until the next wash. It doesn&#x27;t give me split ends and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. The idea of a fabric pad on one side is genius. I think that&#x27;s what saves your hair from getting dry and gives it body and shine.</li>
    <li> This flat iron did NOTHING for my slightly wavy hair.  I expected it to be gentle but I expected it to at least straighten my hair.  This iron is for someone with extremely fine, wispy hair.  Certainly not my long, thick waves.  I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I finally found the perfect flat iron.  I was using a store bought flat iron that did flatten my thick, frizzy, wild hair but it flattened it too much and made it stiff and was damaging the ends.  I was looking for a professional flat iron that would flatten my hair and yet still have body, fullness and wouldn&#x27;t dry out and damage my hair.  This flat iron does just that.  I washed my hair as usual and I dried my hair using my large round brush then I used the flat iron and it worked fantastic.  My hair didn&#x27;t flatten like a pancake.  It took out the frizz and it was fluffy with shine and it lasted for days.  I only wash my hair once every five days.  I also use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny Serum and Seal and Shine.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It is very different from any flat iron I have owned in the past as it does not give you a stick straight look but rather more body. It is essentially a blown out look made easier with a flat iron. Just make sure the logo is closest to you when ironing as I have found this gives the best results.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron, it gives me a shiny smooth look but with volume, like a blowout. Not at all damaging or drying to my hair. It works especially well on my bangs- I don&#x27;t accidentally burn my forehead like before with my traditional 2 heated plate iron, since there is a cooler fabric side on this iron that I don&#x27;t have to worry about when I straighten my bangs. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Ineffective overpriced product worth of $40. Invest instead in to Argan Oil and big velcro rolls to attain healthy shine and volume. The price is disgraceful.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, naturally straight hair that takes about 1-1 1/2 hours to blow out, a process I don&#x27;t often have time for. My hair also tends to be on the drier, more brittle side so I prefer to let it air dry without applying too much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t owned a hair iron since I was about 14 years old because I don&#x27;t like the pin straight effect I get with most irons, but the Ferrum Iron is a tool I use on a regular basis and has made my hair routine so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still air dry my hair but instead of waiting 1-2 days for it to naturally settle and become less \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;, I can use the Ferrum to tame, shape and smooth my hair and give it a more blown out look immediately after washing. It&#x27;s not nearly as harsh on my hair as other irons I have owned. If you are looking for the pin straight look of a typical hair iron this is not for you but I highly recommend it for girls trying to manage thicker hair but still want a natural looking end result.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  I love the way it straightens my hair (natural hair) without burning it straight.  Mine stopped working after a little over a year so I tried to use another and was so disappointed.  I reached out to Ladies &amp; Gents and even though I was outside of the year warranty they offered to send me another.  Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had for one week, but so far LOVE this Flat Iron.  - Doesn&#x27;t seem as harsh on the hair as the others</li>
    <li> The product is amazing. My hair type is 4A and it really did a great job with only one pass. My hair felt soft and silky to the touch! A must have.</li>
    <li> DIDN&#x27;T GET HOT ENOUGH FOR ME</li>
    <li> I love this thing. My hair is a massive mess of unattractive frizzy curl which has left several flat irons begging to be put out of their misery. While I tame the monster with keratin treatments, it needs a little help when the keratin starts to wear off. The Ferrum flat iron is nice to my hair, smoothing it without burning it, denting it, or making it too limp. When my flat iron died, the company&#x27;s customer service department responded to my e-mail within an hour and shipped another one right away, no questions asked. Standing ovation.</li>
    <li> This iron does exactly as promised.  I blow my hair out with a big brush for body, then straighten and smooth the ends. It straightens it out without sacrificing the body.  Cheap irons have the on/off switches in places where when you use them, you end up shutting them off without knowing it. This iron has the switches in the right places, and it heats up quickly and hot.  I love it.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am very particular with what I use on my hair.  The Ferrum flat iron is exactly what I needed to achieve the results of a great flat iron but without the worry of damaging my hair.  The combination of the ceramic and fabric really puts my mind at ease and doesn&#x27;t damage the hair, and I am left with smooth, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the customer service at Ferrum is second to none.  I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> LOVE this flat iron, glides through my hair like silk and that is what my hair feels like. Also had a question so I emailed Ferrum, got a response in less than 5 minutes, that speaks volumes about the company to me!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate, order yours NOW!!!!</li>
    <li> This is simply the best iron out there and here is why. It is designed with one plate that produces the heat but on the other side is a cushioned fabric. What happens is you get all the heat to your hair without the overkill of having a hot plate on the other side. I do have fine to medium hair but lots of it. Those with courser hair may need to just use a higher setting. It goes to 450, I am good at 375 or so. And let me tell you these guys stand behind their product. I initially had some difficulty with Amazon as I just got a random defective iron and they were not going to let me return it. I heard from Ashkan at the Ferrum company immediately. He apologized and said if there is ever a problem to just call and they will take care of it. The iron is one of the more expensive ones but well worth it for the quality. My hair I have to say really does look darling. I just pass it down my hair with a little twist at the end for some curl.</li>
    <li> yep, i fell for the fad. i was so excited to get this product. but lets be real, no pain no gain; no proper heat no proper straightening. it works at best for moderate curls in a dry climate. the fabric side seems to pull out hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half asian, half white, and I have thick, sort of wavy hair that I hate flat ironing because it&#x27;s usually overkill.  I had been using the old version of this iron and liked it a lot.  But this new version is even better.  It works great on my hair. I can adjust the temperature and have a lot of control over the way my hair looks. It still releases some steam from my hair but not as much as I have seen in the past and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp at all. Great tool for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron will probably work better on hair that is somewhat straight. It definitely doesn&#x27;t work so well for my kinky natural hair.</li>
    <li> I  have purchased so many new styling tools trying to give life to my fine,thin, limp hair.  I was hesitant to spend the money because I have been disappointed so many times.NOT THIS TIME. If something happened to it, I would buy another one tomorrow. It makes my hair smooth without flattening it, with little or no damage.  I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> These flat irons take some getting used to, but they are definitely worth the money. My hair is so shiny and I don&#x27;t feel likeI&#x27;m damaging my hair with heat.</li>
    <li> flat iron gets the job done after I blow dry my 3c 4a natural hair. I love it. My hair isn&#x27;t damaged!</li>
    <li> did not work on my hair.....caused breakage</li>
