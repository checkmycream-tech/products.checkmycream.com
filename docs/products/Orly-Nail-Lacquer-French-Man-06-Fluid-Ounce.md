<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> High quality polish. Doesn&#x27;t tend to peel off, even after a few days. With one coat, it looks clear. Two coats will give you a nice pink tint.</li>
    <li> If you put one coat of this on with a clear topcoat it makes your nails look really healthy.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long though, but I enjoy this product a lot.</li>
    <li> I Like this color for when I dont feel like having color on my nails.It looks shiny and naturally kept.Its also a base for french manicure.</li>
    <li> Works great on nail bed before you put acrylic powder over it..gives nail bed a natural look..</li>
    <li> I use it for my french manicures.  I don&#x27;t go over the white tip with it but just beneath the white line and then I let dry and paint the entire nail with a clear top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was funny, a friend of mine thought I had a gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is harder to find now in beauty stores so I must rack up.</li>
    <li> I never get color when getting a manicure.  I am very hard on my nails and typically the polish is chipped before I am out of the parking lot!  This polish is perfect because it is very sheer but has a beautiful tinted sheen that really looks natural.  You can&#x27;t see when it chips or starts to wear off.  I love it!  I have gotten many compliments on my nails using this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the polish yet. I just received the product this morning. This review is to warn that the color represented in the product&#x27;s photograph is totally wrong. \\&quot;Sheer Beauty\\&quot; is a WHITE polish . . . No hint of rose. If you want a rose tint, don&#x27;t buy \\&quot;Sheer Beauty\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Perfect natural pink look</li>
    <li> This is the 4th bottle I have ordered through Amazon. I do manicures and pedicures and whenever a lady says she does not want polish, I pull out this bottle and she falls in love. It just gives the nails a natural but very healthy look by pinking up the nail bed. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I got two of these because tints are so hard to find, and especially hard to find in anything like a natural colour.  This fits the bill!  It&#x27;s a lovely, semi-transparent pinkish red that mimics and enhances a healthy skin tone.  Perfect for those looking for a 20s-30s look.  Can be combined with Orly French Manicure &amp;#34;Softest White&amp;#34; for French manicure/moon-tips looks that closely resemble the tints used in early vintage pictures.  Sure, we all love the pin-up look, but it&#x27;s not appropriate for all occasions.  This is a gem in disguise --I hope they keep making it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I was looking for some tinted clear top coat that would give me that pinkish yet very natural look. This works even with acrylic nails. It makes them look very natural. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Got this for my thirteen year old twins because they won&#x27;t leave mine alone. I&#x27;ve been a fan of orly since forever. This polish gives your nails a natural healthy look and it looks awsome french. My girls are totally happy.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous natural looking nails is what this polish provides.  Last 2 weeks on me and when it starts to come off you can&#x27;t tell because it&#x27;s so sheer.</li>
    <li> I was upset because instead of bare rose, which is the color I have been so looking forward to receive, I got a white one.</li>
    <li> I Love this sheer pink color n orly products. It gives a very natural pink healthy nail look. Love it! I don&#x27;t wear many colors, I&#x27;m a pink n white lady mostly. And this is the perfect pink.</li>
    <li> If you like a more natural nail polish look, then this sheer pink is what you need for a pretty American or French manicure. Other nail-bed polishes are too opaque for my taste; this color is completely transparent, so your nail &amp;#34;moons&amp;#34; will actually show through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paint my tips first, then put just one thin coat of this lacquer on just the nail bed (don&#x27;t paint over the white). Once it dries, I add a couple of clear topcoat layers. The final result is a natural-looking manicure with healthy pink nail beds. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Such a pretty color. Light, clear, just enough to give my nails some life without looking too painted.  I use a base coat and top coat to make it last.</li>
    <li> The color of the polish pictured was NOT the color that I was expecting to get.  I got some polish that was white not the redish color that was pictured.  Isnt that false advertising???  Now Im stuck with this white color polish that I didnt even want.  And this polish is expensive.  Please advertise the color that you are actually selling!!!</li>
    <li> I thought this would make my French manicure look more natural and pop more. It doesn&#x27;t look good if you put more than one coat on or if you brush it over the white tips.</li>
    <li> Gives a beautiful natural pink tint to your nails</li>
    <li> I cannot wait to use this polish to do an American Manicure!</li>
