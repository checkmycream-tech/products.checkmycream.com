<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great tweezers. I have one in my work vehicle, my shop, and my house. Sharp enough and strong enough to pull those tough ones.. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I already had one of these and decided that it worked so good that I needed some more to put in other locations like my tool bag and second home.  I have used these to not only remove small splinters but also for working with electronic components in repairing old tube radios.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as the hype.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have these two pair at my framing shop. They are perfect for splinters! Have a pair at home, as well</li>
    <li> Got a pair of these for my toolbox at work, it came with 2 so i have one for home as well.  great for pulling out splinters, glass slivers or metal slivers, everyone borrows them at work. Great grip that won&#x27;t slip, at a great price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> Yes, these are the same as UNCLE BILL&#x27;s Sliver Gripper Tweezers in the little tube! But these, have little hooks;  the &#x27;eye&#x27; of the Sliver-Gripper is gripped by the hooks, and yes you can carry them on your keychain.  To unlock, you simply press the tweezers together, and slightly pull apart.  Very clever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for years.  I&#x27;ve tried every brand of tweezers for years for many purposes, and only THESE work best.  They do far more than remove slivers, but for that purpose you can&#x27;t find anything better.  I almost want to say that if you buy them and don&#x27;t like them, sell them back to me!  Except, I just bought five more of them from Amazon.  My first two lasted 20 years.  Lost one about 10 years ago.  The other one remaining is a must-have whenever I travel.  So now, I have six. One for the glove compartment, one for the suitcase, one for the purse, one for the office, one for the ... well, you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them also to retrieve things which fall between my keyboard keys, for mishaps while travelling (the airline people aren&#x27;t worried about THESE tweezers).  They aren&#x27;t good for longer-reach applications (hair out of the drainpipe);  use your old tweezers for that. For you won&#x27;t go back to another type, once you use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes them special is the precision point and especially its thin stiffness.  Whether personal grooming or modelling, arts and crafts, even special close work with delicate equipment, these tweezers belong somewhere handy.  Like, on a keychain...</li>
    <li> I have used one of these for years but I seem to never have it handy when I get a splinter.  I ordered 4 packages so I could have one in each truck first aid kit. 1 for each of my kids so when I am at their house I have one to use and one for my office. Since they are thin I will probably keep one in my wallet too.  These are the absolute best for gripping a splinter to get it out.</li>
    <li> not a good as the original but a must have with kids and wood</li>
    <li> They are ok. These are legendary, and have been around a long, long time. They are not like Tweezerman  tweezers but will come in handy for many tasks. They fill the void between good sharp tweezers that are a pin in the butt to carry and a pocket knife. If you have them, you will use them. A good thing to keep in your lunchbox if you work with metal or wood, great addition to a first aid kit.</li>
    <li> great little tweezers</li>
    <li> Husband is a woodworker whose constantly getting slivers. I was tired of him ruining my &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; tweezers for his sliver needs so got these. Turns out, these are even better at getting to slivers! The 2 pack is great.. 1 stays home, the other in his truck</li>
    <li> second order.  lost mine and immediately ordered 2 more.  works great for slivers</li>
    <li> Very handy and well made.</li>
    <li> great set - fine point, very accurate</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and works well.</li>
    <li> Whatever possessed me? These are completely useless; I tried to grasp a hair, and the tweezers slipped right off.</li>
    <li> Seller provided great service and good prices too.  Thank you, v/r Susan</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and was happy to be able to replace the one I lost.</li>
    <li> These are the best! I grew up using these and after you use them once you&#x27;ll never appreciate a regular pair of tweezers again! Regular tweezers evenually get warped or bent and you can&#x27;t grap anything at all with them, these ones don&#x27;t. Simple design with very effective results. BUY THESE!</li>
    <li> best splinter remover ever, you can&#x27;t really appreciate that until you use them. So simple but impressive. Great gift for handyman, woodworker, carpenter or your favorite DIY&#x27;er</li>
    <li> these are very small. I think they will be useful as long as I dont loose them. It would be helpful to have a case for them.</li>
    <li> these things are great. I have made sure that everyone in the family has a pair hanging on there key-chain.</li>
    <li> These are great for removing splinters</li>
    <li> These are fantastic.  They are small and perfect for  your keychain.  They work well and are highly accurate.  I&#x27;m buying more for friends!</li>
    <li> Good product.  They have a couple sharp edges that were not polished or it would be five stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the negative reviews are about. Mine are both precisely ground and meet up cleanly at the point. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These are replacements for one that I lost. I keep one on my key chain. Great for slivers in the shop, working in the garden, or hiking and camping.&lt;br /&gt;Never leave the house without one of these.Unlike some of the reviews, I found these to be of the same quality as the original.</li>
    <li> This is what it says on Uncle Bill&#x27;s website: &amp;#34;Uncle Bill&#x27;s Sliver Gripper is all about an American success story. We follow Uncle Bill&#x27;s model of an American made quality tool that is still hand polished and hand sharpened just as Uncle Bill did 30 years ago.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I saw that my new tweezers were nothing like my old ones, I called to get the straight scoop.  The guy I talked to told me that twenty years ago, they completely changed how they were made.  They guy I spoke with told me that the tweezers would cost &amp;#34;forty bucks each&amp;#34; if they were still made the old way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old ones had really sweet precise points.  These don&#x27;t.  These are cheaply stamped, poorly finished where it counts, at the tip.  They don&#x27;t work anything like the old ones, unless and until you put a bevel and a point on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can&#x27;t simultaneously claim that these are made the old way, and also say that they&#x27;d cost $40 each if they were. I don&#x27;t appreciate the cheapening of a beloved survival tool, nor being lied to about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping these under protest, and putting a point and an edge on them myself, which will certainly take me a couple of hours, thus raising the cost of these tweezers to forty bucks a piece, in terms of my time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So buy these if you must.  The guy claimed they hadn&#x27;t made the metal thinner over the years, but I would almost swear that my old pair was stiffer and less susceptible to sideways deflection.  Whatever.  Like so many things, these just ain&#x27;t what they used to be.  I would have much preferred that they maintain quality and raise prices as necessary, instead of cheaping out.</li>
    <li> These tweezers fit nicely on a key chain or inside a back country first aid kit.  It&#x27;s always a good idea to carry tweezers when your in a area with ticks.</li>
    <li> a little expensive for what they are, but they do work well.  I keep a pair in my toolbox and another stays with my camping gear.  They work well and the holder protects the tips and locks in the tweezers.  You&#x27;ll like these.</li>
    <li> not to be left out of my tool box, works great</li>
    <li> Really stout, and convenient to carry with the keychain attachment.  Handy to have with you all the time---but if you get a tricky splinter, you might want to have a &amp;#34;Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze&amp;#34; at home.  More dough than this, and not so convenient to carry around, but really precise.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to these at a bait shop  they were sold as Tic Removers. They lasted for over 20 yers. Was hap</li>
    <li> I hate being without tweezers. Before buying these, I would often have to wait to get home to tweeze while being driven crazy all day by a tiny spiky hair on my chin or upper lip area. UGH, hate!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse than no tweezers is (say it with me, people) tweezers that don&#x27;t work!!! With so many inexpensive tweezers, I find myself saying, &amp;#34;WHY did I buy these? They bend and don&#x27;t function after a few uses! Ridiculous.&amp;#34;  Bad, busted tweezers just leave me frustrated and sometimes hurt from trying to get an impossible stray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these Uncle Bill&#x27;s tweezers are pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;A) because of their design and quality, they haven&#x27;t warped/bent, and this is after many uses and being kicked around at the bottom of my purse with other stuff. Other inexpensive tweezers don&#x27;t survive that kind of treatment.  Uncle Bill&#x27;s do.&lt;br /&gt;B) they&#x27;re so portable.  Though I haven&#x27;t put them on a keychain yet (even though that&#x27;s the whole reason I bought them!), they are so flat that they&#x27;re easy to stick in a wallet or wristlet. I bought a few of these tweezers to put in different places, and there is something FANTASTIC about ALWAYS HAVING TWEEZERS.&lt;br /&gt;C) they are pretty good tweezers! Not the best ever (my absolute favorite is a La Cross discontinued double-ended tweezer, which I still have and treasure!), but by alternating between Uncle Bill tweezers&#x27; pointy tip and side edge, I can almost always nab stubborn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;D) they&#x27;re small and lend themselves well to side-edge use, which I&#x27;ve found means I can conceal them in my hand and pluck some annoying face hairs by feel while doing other things.  It&#x27;s not too obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, these tweezers are great because of their quality, durability, and portability. Good work, Uncle Bill&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I would not be without one of these in every truck I have and several in the barn and house.  Small enough to loose easily or not get in the way but big enough to a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> Storman Norman of Desert Storm fame recommended these many years ago.  They are one of those pieces of kit that punch above their weight and quickly and efficiently solve that irritating and inevitable splinter problem.  If you are ever in the boonies owning this little gizmo is essential.</li>
    <li> These things are pretty awesome.  You will use them a lot more than you think. My only reservation about buying them was wondering if they would come off of my keys and get lost.  They haven&#x27;t come off accidentally yet and it seems very likely that they never will, but they are easy to take off when you want to. Hopefully, you can see in the attached pic that the little nub on the keychain part goes in the hole in the tweezers and holds them securely until you squeeze them to remove.</li>
    <li> only tweezers I bother trying to use these days.</li>
    <li> best tweezers out there! sharp and precise!</li>
    <li> Awesome product purchased this for removing key shavings from my hands. Its works well with small fine metal material and with soft organic material. I had some weird thorn in the bottom of my foot the day these arrived I tore open the package and quickly was able to remove the item. Instant satisfaction.</li>
    <li> These work surprisingly well, are compact and have a very clever storage system that allows you to put them on a keychain, or something. Really, there&#x27;s not much to dislike here.</li>
    <li> It may not the best for irritating small hairs, but does great when it comes to splinters and so on.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t used uncle bills tweezers to pull slivers from hand, you should. The only thing I use anymore.</li>
    <li> I had a pair of these tweezers for years and they worked perfectly.  I recently bought two new pair and the points are not even and don&#x27;t mate very well.  They won&#x27;t be any good for fine slivers.</li>
    <li> Junk.  I still have the original, wanted another set, but these are pointless.  Sold out, it happens.  Really, how many bad reviews do you need to get this.</li>
    <li> They wok perfect for getting out the smallest of splinters</li>
    <li> Thank you very much. I did receive the items on the day you stated.</li>
    <li> Great little tweezers for slivers.  No nonsense.</li>
    <li> I found one in a old hard where store. then looked for another for years. light soled well made. Thank you</li>
    <li> If you work around anything pointy, you will get a sliver. How will you end the agony? A sewing needle sterilized with a match? I don&#x27;t think so! Uncle Bill&#x27;s Tweezers are precision machined and wider than traditional tweezers so the tips actually line up perfectly even after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep one or two Uncle Bills Sliver Gripper Precision Tweezers handy. You&#x27;ll want two so you can hide a backup, because these disappear from medicine cabinets like they were made of solid gold. Easily and comfortably grip metal and wood slivers and thorns. You&#x27;ll look forward to your next sliver just so you can reach for your Uncle Bills Sliver Gripper Precision Tweezers (not really, slivers suck).</li>
    <li> uncle bills are the best  tweezers ever , hands down , they can get the smallest little pieces ever . lifetime warranty , made in the usa , what more could an american ask for . don&#x27;t buy chinese crap !!!!</li>
    <li> Best shop tweezers ever.</li>
    <li> Love these things. Have had one for 15 years bought one for each of my family so I could get mine back.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years and found none better! Must get the Precision model  for very best use!!</li>
    <li> Simply the best. Small so they are always with me. If you want to get a gift that will be used, this is it!</li>
    <li> I have used these for at least 30 years. This recent replacement order delivered tweezers that are not nearly as precise as ones I&#x27;ve had.  I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> love them especially for removing tiny threads</li>
    <li> These are not what they used to be. The old ones were ground to a fine point from the outside edges in. These are just stamped out, and kind of crude compared to the originals. These new ones are blunt in comparison. The old ones were sharp at the tip, and could be used to kind of dig out the splinter.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing. Best purchase in years.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Well made and comes in very handy. What a great idea!</li>
    <li> I carry these in my Leatherman sheath along with my multi tool. They fit perfectly and work great. What else can I say.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been carrying one of these for the past 20 years after it was given to me by a friend.  Very well made and they work great, buy a dozen, they work great as inexpensive gifts that keep on giving - actually useful.</li>
    <li> I saw this at a party. Someone was using it to help remove a splinter (really!). When I inquired what it was, I was told that it was Uncle Bill&#x27;s Splinter Picker. After I told him that I thought it was great, he gave it to me, saying he had another at home. I love it; it&#x27;s been added to my very sparse keychain - a valuable tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SInce he gave it to me, I felt that I was obligated to pass it on to someone else. I went online and bought a half-dozen to give to family members (along with the eGear Pico Lite), and gave them out at a family gathering.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are good quality and made in the USA. I bought the version that has a metal sheath which keeps them flat with the points protected while not in use. Very unobtrusive and easy to travel with thanks to this feature. The point of the tweezers seems like it would make it easy to pull out a tick or splinter. However, these tweezers are difficult to use for general tweezing since they are not slant tipped. I would rate them higher if they were better for general tweezing.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had a splinter, you know what big pain a small sliver can cause.  These are the best for getting rid of all kinds of splinters.  Get one and you&#x27;ll want more - home, business, car, or as gifts.</li>
    <li> What great little tweezers.  One for the house and one for the purse.  Great little stocking stuffer!  WHY ARE WE FORCED TO TYPE MORE?  GREAT GREAT GREAT....is that enough words now?</li>
    <li> I use these for everything. In all emergency kits, on all the bikes, hiking, etc. For the price, I&#x27;ve not found anything better.</li>
    <li> Really useful pair of tweezers. It has a very fine pine so you can use that to dig out splinters and such under the skin. Also since the point is very sharp and precise it can really grab onto very small objects that other tweezers wouldn&#x27;t be able to .Very small and light so easy to carry with your kesys all the time without any hassle and bulk. Also I can  see these being useful as a self defense weapon if you are every attacked.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are fabulous for pulling threads. They are the only tweezers that I&#x27;ve found that will really grasp tiny filaments.</li>
    <li> These get the splinters out in no time.</li>
    <li> absolutely awesome... A must have for anyone working with splinters</li>
    <li> These things are freakin great lost my first pair, totally my fault. They secure very well and cannot imagine how they would fall off their keychain attachment. They have a nice point and grab well. Great gift item that is inexpensive and people will use. I&#x27;m a carpenter so I think they are essential.</li>
    <li> Black paint(?) is chipping off the case after only a few days.  Get what you pay for.  Otherwise fairly solid.  Has no screen protector.</li>
    <li> Handy dandy for lots of stuff.</li>
    <li> Too small for my hands</li>
    <li> This was very disappointing. It is very small and doesn&#x27;t work very well when plucking eyebrows. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> very tiny, very useful for innumerable applications- I have several which I keep in my purse, first aid kit &amp; around the house</li>
    <li> For real? these are no more than a bent piece of metall. ok they are tweezers.. but the end all of tweezers.. I think not.. I keep a pair in the car.. the best thing I can say about them is that they have a little holder so I don&#x27;t get stuck by them.</li>
    <li> Now hanging on all my keychains.</li>
    <li> Amazing device for efficiency and results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how this simple design is so effective in extracting splinters. The item is compact and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers in the world. I&#x27;ve been buying these for years and will never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> This replaces one I have had for years and that works perfectly for removing splinters etc.&lt;br /&gt;Also now includes a very clever key ring holder that works much better than I expected - it&#x27;s easy to get the tweezers on &amp; off but absolutely won&#x27;t fall off by accident.</li>
    <li> been around for years yanking little splinters out of fingers and ticks off pups that got in too deep. may be better ones out there but these do it well and for cheap. I live in thenwoods so keep them everywhere.</li>
    <li> My dad has had these on his key chain for years. Best splinter remover ever, so I finally asked him about it. Bought a pair for home, work, camper, and thinking would make great stocking suffers...</li>
    <li> Great tweezer for hardanger embroidery, which is why I bought it.  But I&#x27;m sure it probably does well with splinters too.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal, use it for anything from pulling the tiniest slivers to personal grooming. These things are a boon in medical kits, on hiking/camping trips, for outdoor activities, or woodworking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so surprised when I meet people who have never heard of this! I remember getting so many nasty splinters as a kid, we always used one of these and it worked like a charm, I&#x27;vee never found anything that works better!</li>
    <li> Love the products and the service was outstanding!!</li>
    <li> my huband is a wood worker &amp; is always getting splinters in his fingers , he keeps one tweezers on his keychain and it is always ready to use.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers you will ever buy</li>
    <li> This 2 pack of Uncle Bills Sliver Gripper Precision Tweezers brings to three my total of them. I already have the black oxide version and they are very precise as it says in their title. Very simple design. Lightweight and functional. I would recommend them to family and friends and to anyone looking for a quality product.</li>
    <li> We have used these for YEARS!!!  The best tool you can have with you at all times!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find these as stellar as others have posted.  They are just OK at tweezing.  I do like the fact that they are safely portable.  Taking them off the holder can be challenging but not a deal breaker.  Would I buy them again? Probably not.</li>
    <li> The BEST tweezers for any tweezer required task, period. They will grip the tiniest sliver or hair nearly invisible to the eye and out it will come. I don&#x27;t even bother with other tweezers anymore. The gripper precision tweezers make others seem so clumsy and useless. The two pack is especially nice because for some reason they get &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; and oops! not returned. They each have a metal sleeve they slip into and it has a hole for hanging or clipping onto a key chain perhaps.</li>
    <li> These tweezers have been hanging on my key-chain since November of 2009 and I have been very pleased with their performance. The tweezers and the metal holder were well designed because they have never inadvertently come off of my key-chain or (as far as I can tell) lost their precision point. I would call these tweezers essential if you go out into areas with thorny plants, work around unfinished wood/metal, or have small children who play outside. I have quickly relieved the pain of thorns and reduced the risk of lyme disease by removing ticks promptly from myself and my dog with this trusted pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that has given me difficulty is when things are deeper below the skin. This is due to their wide angle tip (about 40 degrees). The width is what allows these compact tweezers to get a good solid grip on thorns and ticks though so you have to choose. I find that a few seconds of trimming with scissors or a knife allow me grab whatever is beneath the skin so the wide point is fine with me. The best tweezers are the ones that you have with you when you need them and can remove what is bothering you. These are superb in both respects because they are so easy to take with you wherever you may be and they do a great job of removing the thorn, burr or tick. If you have any questions about this product, leave a comment and I will answer you to the best of my knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line&lt;br /&gt;Five stars, easy. I would definitely buy them again in the future if I lost this pair. They made these tweezers right.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers that wok. Handy Key chain attachment makes for convenient storage. Get several to keep them in the shop and on a lanyard hanging near the first aid kit. Have gifted many of these to my scout leader friends and others that are woodworkers. All are very pleased with how the narrow point and sturdy steel works.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers in a convenient form.</li>
    <li> These are a must have if you work with wood or if you have children.</li>
    <li> I carry these when backpacking. Also have another set in the house. They work! Can&#x27;t beat the fact that they are made in the USA, too!</li>
    <li> I do handyman work and woodworking, so I get my share of splinters. The Uncle Bills Sliver Grippers fit in my pocket or on a keychain so they are always handy. I gave the second pair to a handyman friend of mine.</li>
    <li> These are really great little tweezers to carry with you. I live in the desert and boy!! They have come in handy! We purchased several sets to have in each car, atv, and pocket.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers for removing splinters!  My other tweezers are high quality, but for some reason they don&#x27;t remove splinters like these Uncle Bill&#x27;s tweezers.  I&#x27;ve been buying them for presents when other people get splinters and/or ticks.  I was grateful to find a two-pack for a great price!</li>
    <li> They work great, good product.</li>
    <li> Greatest tweezers invented! Will grip the smallest slivers. Wouldn&#x27;t do without a pair!</li>
    <li> Got these for all my friends, had purchased originally at Restoration Hardware and loved it but could never find them again! Perfect sharp point for removing spinters!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t own a pair of these, you need to buy some.  The tweezers are significantly better than any I&#x27;ve used before, one piece construction and a point make them ideal for removing splinters or stingers or glass or metal shards.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever!  Have a splinter - these are the tweezers you need.</li>
    <li> These are excellent tweezers which I keep on my keychain, and have given to family and friends.  Well made, and made in the USA</li>
    <li> Put one of these on my keys and have already used it multiple times. I&#x27;ve removed ticks, splinters, and a metal sliver. I didnt realize how much I needed them before I had them. I gave one away as a gift and hope they are getting as much use as I already have. Some people have complained about the tip, but no problems here. Would definatly recommend. This product.</li>
    <li> This is the best tweezer you can buy. I&#x27;ve had several for decades and bought these for spares. They go on your keychain so you will always have them with you.</li>
    <li> These are far and away the best tweezers we have ever used.  They never fail to get what we&#x27;re after, be it a splinter or a lose thread on a hobby project.  This is one of those must-have household items!  Try these, and you&#x27;ll wonder why you&#x27;ve messed around with anything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RayB</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool I&#x27;d you deal with splinters/insects/ingrown nail/all kinda stuff, or would want to help others who do.  Good stainless build, they lock in holder, I just keep on a dog tag chain always there when I need them.  A must for any good medic/survival kit.</li>
    <li> Precise, and very useful as splinter for cep. A must for every first aid kit.</li>
    <li> These are super cool tiny little tweezers.  Hubby wanted these to keep in his car/pockets.  They are small and streamlined.  Very precise.  The only complaint is that they are SO small they are easy to misplace.</li>
    <li> Great product and need to buy a few more.  The other good thing is made in the USA.  Wish I could say that about more items.</li>
    <li> What is better than order one?  Ordering them in a pack of two!</li>
    <li> These are incredibly helpful - super compact and are easily carried on a keyring. Perfect for those of us that engage in wood-working!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND ASKED FOR THESE FOR XMAS FOR SPLINTERS WHILE WOODWORKING. I ORDERED AN EXTRA SET FOR MYSELF BECAUSE GOOD TWEEZERS ARE HARD TO FIND SOMETIMES THEY WON&#x27;T CLOSE TIGHT ENOUGH AND JUST PULL OFF WHATEVER YOU ARE TRYING TO TWEEZE. THESE HAVE THAT PROBLEM DO NOT WORK WELL FOR THEIR PURPOSE AT ALL. tHER ARE ALSO DIFFICULT TO RELEASE FROM THEIR HOLDER. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> They are great I love them</li>
    <li> I have several of these, one in every craft bag and around each of my many sewing machines.  Indispensable for picking our sewn stitches, removing cross-stitch or embroidery stitches, getting knots out of threads, fixing just about any craft mistake.  Cannot, simply CANNOT, live without this tool! I have given these tweezers to all my sewing or crafting friends.</li>
