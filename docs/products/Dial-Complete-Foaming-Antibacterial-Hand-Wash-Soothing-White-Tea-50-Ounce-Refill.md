      <li>Its more like water with fragrance prefer softsoap over this.</li>
      <li>My favorite smelling hand soap.</li>
      <li>thought it was more coconut.  </li>
      <li>More like water.</li>
      <li>Amazon, which sends it shipping free, offers a good value and a great convenience.</li>
      <li>This item arrived leaking and with the top caved in.</li>
      <li>I just love the smell.</li>
      <li>it is better to do this than go to the store every month</li>
      <li>Glad I can buy it in bulk here.</li>
      <li>It must be more than just a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>easy to refill containers.</li>
      <li>, it was easy to pour the contents of this bottle into the pumps and the quality is just as good as if I bought a brand new pump already loaded</li>
      <li>Worked fine.  </li>
      <li>I like this product for it&#x27;s ease of use and light scent.  </li>
      <li>Cheap, works in my foam dispensers.</li>
      <li>To me it has a  light floral fragrance, one of the guys here at the office</li>
      <li>Rinses easily and leave skin smooth, and fresh.</li>
      <li>Works like the original soap in the original bottle.</li>
      <li>Love the sent and nice to have a hug bottle for refill instead of having to keep buying the individual pumps.</li>
      <li>The Fresh Pear and now the Soothing White Tea are both great scents.  </li>
      <li>When it foams up, you get a good lather and it is just like using regular soap, however, if you try and use this like regular soap, you will not get good results.</li>
      <li>Luckily, it was in the plastic.</li>
      <li>This is not alcohol based soap that quickly evaporates.  </li>
      <li>The product is great, but I don&#x27;t really understand why the cap to these bottles don&#x27;t have a seal on them to prevent leaking, and also, I don&#x27;t know why the cap is loose when it is shipped.</li>
      <li>Definitely works and is a must-have if you love the original product you bought.</li>
      <li>I LIKE IT VERY MUCH....</li>
      <li>It certainly works well, but, I think it is more economical to purchase regular liquid soap and dilute per instructions with dispensers.</li>
      <li>I paid WAY too much for this!</li>
      <li>it is worth the price, rather than buying a new dispenser each time.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really care about the antibacterial feature.</li>
      <li>I wish only that it still came in Cool Plum.</li>
      <li>Saving so much money by refilling instead of buying new pumps all of the time.  </li>
      <li>THE PLASTIC IS NOT THICK AND TENDS TO COLLAPSE IN YOUR GRIP...</li>
      <li>I HAVE NO COMPLAINT WITH THE SOAP.....</li>
      <li>My last purchase was Fresh Pear.  </li>
      <li>This is only for a very certain type of foaming hand pump.</li>
      <li>and I thought instead of getting a new bottle everytime</li>
      <li>Thank god I don&#x27;t have to keep buying new containers.</li>
      <li>They want you to buy new pump bottles instead of refilling them.  </li>
      <li>IT IS PRETTY BIG AROUND</li>
      <li>A little pricey but love the different scent</li>
      <li>the clear color so no color residue.</li>
      <li>No problem so far</li>
      <li>I find it very annoying, so I was glad to find this nearly fragrance-free soap for a good price.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m very certain this is watered down.</li>
      <li>Found this and have used it for several months and it completely fills the bill.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Dial Complete Foaming Antibacterial Hand Wash Refill for several years now.  </li>
      <li>It creates a nice thick foam and a little goes a long way.</li>

<li> I have been using the Dial Complete Foaming Antibacterial Hand Wash Refill for several years now.  </li>
<li> It creates a nice thick foam and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Seemed to be a little watered down though, and we ran out quickly.</li>
<li> &amp;#34;Pump into DRY hands&amp;#34;, say the instructions.  </li>
<li> No, you&#x27;re supposed to put this soap on DRY (as they print it</li>
<li> The cap was loose, and we lost some of the soap.</li>
<li> It was unwrapped, and loose in the box in which it was shipped  </li>
<li> Not much to say, It is soap...</li>
<li> SO BE CAREFUL....</li>
<li> AND ONCE YOUR HANDS GET WET OR SOAPY</li>
<li> Triclosan is also in tootpaste, so I think that it&#x27;s being in soap is not that alarming.</li>
<li> I just wanted liquid soap - as typically added to wet hands.  </li>
<li> Does not seem as thick as the stuff I buy in the store by the same brand.</li>
<li> wasnt sealed, appeared watered down</li>
<li> Practically, it becomes a mess.</li>
<li> My daughter prefers the foam pumps over the liquid ones, and after the mess she makes in the bathroom</li>
<li> Much less expensive to refill the soap dispenser then to buy a new one every time.</li>
<li> If you have one of those little foam-er pumps ...</li>
<li> I wish it was a little gentler on fragrance and skin.</li>
<li> The liquid soap in the refill is so thin that I need a lot of it when I am washing hands and even then it doesn&#x27;t produce enough froth.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t have to waste water to use it.  </li>
<li> Not to mention less waste!</li>
<li> I can a each small soap dispenser about 5-6 times, so</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The title says it all.  You can purchase this at target for 1/4 the cost.  I bought this without doing any research as I had a baby the week before and wanted some good antibacteral soap in the house and wasn&#x27;t in any condition to go out shopping or comparison shop.</li>
    <li> I like that this size is offered and I like the scent, but I&#x27;m very certain this is watered down. Does not seem as thick as the stuff I buy in the store by the same brand. I also agree with another review that the bottle is almost impossible to hold. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It certainly works well, but, I think it is more economical to purchase regular liquid soap and dilute per instructions with dispensers. Also, it contains Triclosan which the FDA is doing further studies on. Triclosan is also in tootpaste, so I think that it&#x27;s being in soap is not that alarming.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, It is soap...&lt;br /&gt;Did an excellent job of sealing the container to prevent leaks during transit.</li>
    <li> Just soap ; I knew what it was gonna be lol</li>
    <li> wasnt sealed, appeared watered down</li>
    <li> Did not have the shipping problems others did. This is a huge amount of soap for a great price. The scent is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really care about the antibacterial feature. Handwashing is handwashing- no chemicals needed</li>
    <li> Nice size bottle and very clean smelling</li>
    <li> This works great and is a good price.  I can a each small soap dispenser about 5-6 times, so it is worth the price, rather than buying a new dispenser each time. Smells good and not to strong. Recommend</li>
    <li> I like a foaming soap so I don&#x27;t have to waste water to use it.  This sterilizer is good in the kitchen when working with meat, and in the bathroom for health issues.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a Target, except 30 miles away, and none of the stores here stock the refill.  Amazon, which sends it shipping free, offers a good value and a great convenience.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Dial Complete Foaming Antibacterial Hand Wash Refill for several years now.  My last purchase was Fresh Pear.  The Fresh Pear and now the Soothing White Tea are both great scents.  Recommend both.</li>
    <li> It is the only liquid hand soap I use. I wish only that it still came in Cool Plum.</li>
    <li> The local chain grocery store stopped carrying refill bottles for the DIAL Foam soap.  They want you to buy new pump bottles instead of refilling them.  So I turned to Amazon and got what I wanted.  Just like what they sold in the store.  Works like the original soap in the original bottle.</li>
    <li> I just love the smell. Couldn&#x27;t find the refill in stores so had to order online.</li>
    <li> Thank god I don&#x27;t have to keep buying new containers. Definitely works and is a must-have if you love the original product you bought.</li>
    <li> Used to refill hand wash squirters - fantastic!</li>
    <li> I paid WAY too much for this!</li>
    <li> Saving so much money by refilling instead of buying new pumps all of the time.  Not to mention less waste!</li>
    <li> Poor product. Doesn&#x27;t foam well. More like water.</li>
    <li> I like this product for it&#x27;s ease of use and light scent.  My daughter prefers the foam pumps over the liquid ones, and after the mess she makes in the bathroom I prefer them too.</li>
    <li> glad i got this to refill my bottle it is better to do this than go to the store every month</li>
    <li> smells good.  foams up well. easy to refill containers. Good product.</li>
    <li> Worked fine.  Seemed to be a little watered down though, and we ran out quickly.</li>
    <li> Great quality delivered to your door!!  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this product.  The nearest store to me is 50+ miles away to purchase this item and the price is comparable.</li>
    <li> Its more like water with fragrance prefer softsoap over this.</li>
    <li> Got tired of buying the expensive, small bottles and wanted to find a refill solution.  Found this and have used it for several months and it completely fills the bill.</li>
    <li> Nice and foamy. Nice scent. No problem so far, no clog, no clumps.&lt;br /&gt;Like the clear color so no color residue.</li>
    <li> I have to comments/concerns.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a wonderful aroma, and the price is great, however, I read some of the reviews, one that stated that the soap came in a bag, and also one that stated the cap was loose upon arrival. When I opened this up, I had the same issue. The cap was loose, and we lost some of the soap. Luckily, it was in the plastic. The product is great, but I don&#x27;t really understand why the cap to these bottles don&#x27;t have a seal on them to prevent leaking, and also, I don&#x27;t know why the cap is loose when it is shipped. It must be more than just a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another person also commented that the soap was &amp;#34;watery and didn&#x27;t lather well&amp;#34;. If you read the label, this is foaming antibacterial hand wash. You are supposed to use this in a foam soap dispenser. It is supposed to be &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;. When it foams up, you get a good lather and it is just like using regular soap, however, if you try and use this like regular soap, you will not get good results. This should ONLY be used with a foam soap dispenser. Directions for all foam soap dispensers tell you if you&#x27;re using regular soap to use one part regular soap and fill the remaining with water, hence creating a &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; soap. I suggest the user buy a foam soap dispenser to use with this. it works like a dream!</li>
    <li> I have used dial hand washer before and I thought instead of getting a new bottle everytime, I will get a big refill bottle. The liquid soap in the refill is so thin that I need a lot of it when I am washing hands and even then it doesn&#x27;t produce enough froth. I am not going to buy refill again from DIAL.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars but it leaked in the box. :(</li>
    <li> This soap works well in foaming soap dispensers.  To me it has a  light floral fragrance, one of the guys here at the office thought it was more coconut.  It creates a nice thick foam and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this to refill the foaming orange colored soap, well alternate between the two scents.  They are suttle, but are nice.</li>
    <li> My favorite smelling hand soap. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else. Glad I can buy it in bulk here.</li>
    <li> I like foaming hand soap and this refill is &amp;#34;spot on&amp;#34;!  I got a gift of Pear foaming hand soap and when it ran out I was sad... So when I saw this Pear scented refill I ordered ot and It is wonderful. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NO COMPLAINT WITH THE SOAP.....I LIKE IT VERY MUCH....MY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE BOTTLE....IT IS PRETTY BIG AROUND AND ONCE YOUR HANDS GET WET OR SOAPY, THERE IS NO WHERE TO GRIP IT AND I DROPPED IT SEVERAL TIMES....IT TAKES BOTH HANDS SO BE CAREFUL....THE PLASTIC IS NOT THICK AND TENDS TO COLLAPSE IN YOUR GRIP...BUT THE SOAP IS VERY GOOD 🌞</li>
    <li> Nothing but All-of-Bests. All the way from Kanya-Kuwari to Kashmir, and from Kuttcha to Assam, Sikkim, Nagaland, and Burma.</li>
    <li> Good smell and foams great.  Much less expensive to refill the soap dispenser then to buy a new one every time.</li>
    <li> Cheap, works in my foam dispensers.</li>
    <li> Great price, mild scent and the foam is great to get the kids to wash their hands. Thumbs up for this product.</li>
    <li> Very glad I found this! Works in a pump from a popular brand of soaps that do not offer refills. The foam is not the thickest I have ever used, but it is sufficient. Great smell! I think the white tea is also a beneficial anti-oxidant. Rinses easily and leave skin smooth, and fresh. I have even used it as a facial cleanser with excellent results!</li>
    <li> Love the sent and nice to have a hug bottle for refill instead of having to keep buying the individual pumps.</li>
    <li> There is no mention of the fact that this can not be used in regular soap dispensers. We received this item and it was as if it was water, it was soooo thined out. This is only for a very certain type of foaming hand pump. It does not say that anywhere is teh description, and we discovered it on the bottle after we purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like shampoo as well. I wish it was a little gentler on fragrance and skin.</li>
    <li> This item arrived leaking and with the top caved in. It was unwrapped, and loose in the box in which it was shipped  I like this product, but am hesitant to order it again.</li>
    <li> Just works :) Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell which is a great plus in my opinion. These days everything is scented: dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, etc. I find it very annoying, so I was glad to find this nearly fragrance-free soap for a good price.</li>
    <li> If you have one of those little foam-er pumps ... this works good.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but love the different scent</li>
    <li> Great value to refill all the pumps I have in my home, it was easy to pour the contents of this bottle into the pumps and the quality is just as good as if I bought a brand new pump already loaded</li>
    <li> This is not Soap, as we commonly know it.  It includes its own water.  &amp;#34;Pump into DRY hands&amp;#34;, say the instructions.  Well that changes everything.  I just wanted liquid soap - as typically added to wet hands.  This is not alcohol based soap that quickly evaporates.  No, you&#x27;re supposed to put this soap on DRY (as they print it) hands.  And then turn on water to wash it off?  I guess the world saves water that way.  Practically, it becomes a mess.</li>
