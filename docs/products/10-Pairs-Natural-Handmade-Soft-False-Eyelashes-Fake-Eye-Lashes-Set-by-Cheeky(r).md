      <li>And I love falsies</li>
      <li>The band itself seems to be made of thread, in which the glue adheres to better</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>and i love the invisible lash line butttt</li>
      <li>I love these eye lashes, goo for every day.</li>
      <li>Buying something like this from most stores costs $3-$6 for just one pair.</li>
      <li>Love them, will most def order more</li>
      <li>natural and beautiful lashees</li>
      <li>GREAT Price and these look very natural.</li>
      <li>Other than that, perfect !!</li>
      <li>If you bend them before applying it&#x27;s easy to put them on.</li>
      <li>These are great, they are just as good quality as the name brand ones from the beauty stores, and they actually look more natural than any</li>
      <li>These are the perfect everyday lash look.</li>
      <li>To be honest, when I bought these, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
      <li>The cheap eyelashes you get from the drug store got nothing on these.</li>
      <li>They are so light weigh, I swear....</li>
      <li>I ordered like 5 items from Amazon on the same day and I received these first, I was super impressed with them.</li>
      <li>Nice items these lashes were light airy and natural looking.</li>
      <li>u have to cut lashes and also bend to get them into a good shape for placement but overall</li>
      <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t get much better then these.</li>
      <li>Very affordable and reasonably priced for such a great item :)</li>
      <li>and they are better than the ones I got the last time from amozon which were more like a plastic material.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
      <li>Are we waiting for them to grow from someone&#x27;s eyelids first?!</li>
      <li>So worth it.</li>
      <li>More conservative and classy.</li>
      <li>over all they are most natural looking but do require a bit of work to apply correctly and to trim the ends so there is not a bunch sticking off the ends.</li>
      <li>I love natural looking lashes that blends with mine to make it look fuller.</li>
      <li>So natural and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>If I was to give anyone tips on wearing false eyelashes, I&#x27;d tell them to save their money &amp; buy these, brush them out a little before applying them to separate and soften them, just be gentle while handling or cleaning them, and then to get some really good glue, the brand I think works the very best is Duo.</li>
      <li>Love these lashes and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
      <li>, they are straight across!</li>
      <li>I bought 3 different styles from this seller and these happen to be my favorite.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s (the &amp;#34;band&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>Over the years I have purchased a few from stores thinking it would be fun to wear for a special occasion, event, or even a costume, and I almost never was able to ever get them on correctly and gave up, or if I did sort of get them on</li>
      <li>These are soft and more natural.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re super natural looking, I think they work great for day use,the band that the eyelashes are connected is thin and flexible which makes them much easier to apply.</li>
      <li>Way better than spending three dollars on a single pair at the store!</li>
      <li>Very wispy and feathery.</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t even have to wear liner to try to &amp;#34;cover the band&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t want to.</li>
      <li>These looked beautiful but the string they are on is black and not very bendable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a very dramatic person.</li>
      <li>Ordered more already due to the compliments I&#x27;ve gotten and the look is so natural.</li>
      <li>I had to cut them a little from the inner corner in order to make them look more suddle, but other than that I liked them.</li>
      <li>My new go to lashes.</li>
      <li>nothing too dramatic, but with still a good length.</li>
      <li>Very soft and natural looking!</li>
      <li>So, being someone who doesn&#x27;t wear false eyelashes frequently and since I did just recently figure out how to successfully apply them correctly, I decided that $2.50 was a bargain even if they weren&#x27;t reusable</li>
      <li>at all they don&#x27;t look natural</li>
      <li>They are so soft that they go on well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to wear lashes too often, however, I&#x27;m trying to start more lately.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so natural</li>
      <li>They are so natural looking.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re super easy to apply and don&#x27;t look fake at all</li>
      <li>They are soft and flexible, you can barely feel them when they&#x27;re on, and you get 10 pairs</li>
      <li>I have ordered a few other false lashes off amazon and so far these are the best.</li>
      <li>So, I bought these because I wanted to learn how to apply fake lashes and this was inexpensive and also the most natural looking of all the lashes I looked at.  </li>
      <li>Somehow, the clear and white ones don&#x27;t dry well on these.</li>
      <li>The shipping takes quite a long time (a couple of weeks, at least where I live) but other than that, they&#x27;re definitely worth the wait!</li>

<li> The shipping takes quite a long time (a couple of weeks, at least where I live) but other than that, they&#x27;re definitely worth the wait!</li>
<li> The band is thin and it is pretty natural looking.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m SUPER ANNOYED that I purchased these on July 4th and today is August 13th</li>
<li> I will have to save these for when I do people with very flat eyes because they straighten and pop the glue.</li>
<li> Very very veryyy thin, I double up every time and apply ample amount of mascara, it does the trick.</li>
<li> They last a week if I am careful with them.  </li>
<li> each lash is so long</li>
<li> so thin, it easily blends within your upper lash line with little to no effort!</li>
<li> they are very natural looking and add length and a little bit of volume!</li>
<li> I cut them in half and only use them on the outside of my lids for a natural-looking enhancement.</li>
<li> As far as the lashes themselves, they are very natural looking and thin....</li>
<li> I just wanted to try false lashes for the first time and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.</li>
<li> so if you mess one up while trying to trim it, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
<li> Was skeptical when first ordered due to a previous purchase with similar company.</li>
<li> Took a little long to arrive.</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> I also bought dark glue to keep these on</li>
<li> That&#x27;s how thin and natural the band looks.  </li>
<li> The band is really thin and blends well with my natural lashes.</li>
<li> On another note, I recommend using a black colored glue with these.</li>
<li> but I wear them everyday and get compliments on them.</li>
<li> , I thought they looked crazy and took them back off anyway, or they didn&#x27;t stay on for long because they peeled up and fell off.</li>
<li> A little hard each set</li>
<li> One pair lasts me for at least 5 days.</li>
<li> They blend so well and the lining is thin.</li>
<li> The lashes are too long and are attached on a thread not a rigid base or something to hold them.</li>

    <li> Very very veryyy thin, I double up every time and apply ample amount of mascara, it does the trick.</li>
    <li> You guys. It&#x27;s so natural it&#x27;s crazy. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even wear eyeliner with them. I&#x27;m not a very dramatic person. More conservative and classy. Order 2 boxes. Some of them got damaged during shipping. But it&#x27;s bound to happen with fragile items. So worth it. My new go to lashes.</li>
    <li> Very wispy and feathery. I think I&#x27;m going to like these!!!!</li>
    <li> NOT @ all as advertised! I ordered these eyelashes especially because they appeay to be longer laterally in the ad... NOT the ones I got, they are straight across!</li>
    <li> Have already ordered more. Love them. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Took a little long to arrive. But I love them, will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> These looked beautiful but the string they are on is black and not very bendable. I will have to save these for when I do people with very flat eyes because they straighten and pop the glue. The hairs are gorgeous however</li>
    <li> The lashes are too long and are attached on a thread not a rigid base or something to hold them. To me they are useless.</li>
    <li> GREAT Price and these look very natural. I cut them in half and only use them on the outside of my lids for a natural-looking enhancement.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Definetly will re-purchase! They&#x27;re super easy to apply and don&#x27;t look fake at all they are very natural looking and add length and a little bit of volume!</li>
    <li> Buying something like this from most stores costs $3-$6 for just one pair.

So, being someone who doesn&#x27;t wear false eyelashes frequently and since I did just recently figure out how to successfully apply them correctly, I decided that $2.50 was a bargain even if they weren&#x27;t reusable (like some are), and if nothing else, I could get some practice applying them. These are great, they are just as good quality as the name brand ones from the beauty stores, and they actually look more natural than any I&#x27;ve ever tried too. They stayed on all night every time I&#x27;ve worn them, and they are reusable too. If I was to give anyone tips on wearing false eyelashes, I&#x27;d tell them to save their money &amp; buy these, brush them out a little before applying them to separate and soften them, just be gentle while handling or cleaning them, and then to get some really good glue, the brand I think works the very best is Duo.</li>
    <li> Great eye lashes for every day use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SUPER ANNOYED that I purchased these on July 4th and today is August 13th and I still have not recieved them!! Whats the hold up?! Are we waiting for them to grow from someone&#x27;s eyelids first?!</li>
    <li> My box was squished when I got them and the lashes were all over the place.</li>
    <li> Nice items these lashes were light airy and natural looking. I would buy them again. Good price too.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a few other false lashes off amazon and so far these are the best. The band is thin and it is pretty natural looking. not for day use tho. going out or photo shoots.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes and I will definitely repurchase. They are so light weigh, I swear.... you won&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;I&#x27;m wearing a hat&amp;#34; feeling on your eyes when you put these on. The band itself seems to be made of thread, in which the glue adheres to better and it&#x27;s (the &amp;#34;band&amp;#34;) so thin, it easily blends within your upper lash line with little to no effort! You really don&#x27;t even have to wear liner to try to &amp;#34;cover the band&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t want to. That&#x27;s how thin and natural the band looks.  As far as the lashes themselves, they are very natural looking and thin.... nothing too dramatic, but with still a good length. The shipping takes quite a long time (a couple of weeks, at least where I live) but other than that, they&#x27;re definitely worth the wait!</li>
    <li> These are a steal!! And I love falsies but I didn&#x27;t like the thickness of the lash band as I have smallish eyes. So I gave them away but do but them you can&#x27;t beat the price and they are a great quality product.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THESE!! Just ordered another batch. They are so natural looking. I love natural looking lashes that blends with mine to make it look fuller. Very affordable and reasonably priced for such a great item :)</li>
    <li> I order these all the time. So natural and easy to apply. Way better than spending three dollars on a single pair at the store! Highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> Not worth it. But hey, I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I love these things ,but wish they came in brown also. They are so soft that they go on well, they don&#x27;t try and straighten out on the lid. They last a week if I am careful with them.  Andrea Heyser</li>
    <li> I love these eye lashes, goo for every day.</li>
    <li> To be honest, when I bought these, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I just wanted to try false lashes for the first time and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot. But I&#x27;m actually very impressed with them! They are soft and flexible, you can barely feel them when they&#x27;re on, and you get 10 pairs so if you mess one up while trying to trim it, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> I loooooove these lashes. I bought 3 different styles from this seller and these happen to be my favorite. I&#x27;m not one to wear lashes too often, however, I&#x27;m trying to start more lately. These are the perfect everyday lash look. The band is really thin and blends well with my natural lashes. On another note, I recommend using a black colored glue with these. Somehow, the clear and white ones don&#x27;t dry well on these. Other than that, perfect !!</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! If you bend them before applying it&#x27;s easy to put them on. I cut them to make sure they look perfect but I wear them everyday and get compliments on them. One pair lasts me for at least 5 days. Ordered more already due to the compliments I&#x27;ve gotten and the look is so natural.</li>
    <li> I ordered like 5 items from Amazon on the same day and I received these first, I was super impressed with them. For the price you really can&#x27;t get much better then these. They&#x27;re super natural looking, I think they work great for day use,the band that the eyelashes are connected is thin and flexible which makes them much easier to apply. The cheap eyelashes you get from the drug store got nothing on these. Love them, will most def order more</li>
    <li> natural and beautiful lashees and i love the invisible lash line butttt each lash is so long so i have to trim them. and sometimes the length is mismatched</li>
    <li> Very bad ..coudnt stake it with any glow</li>
    <li> Was skeptical when first ordered due to a previous purchase with similar company. But wow these are great if you know how to apply lashes these will be perfect for full nice lashes. They blend so well and the lining is thin. A little hard each set u have to cut lashes and also bend to get them into a good shape for placement but overall the end result is beautiful will buy more!</li>
    <li> So, I bought these because I wanted to learn how to apply fake lashes and this was inexpensive and also the most natural looking of all the lashes I looked at.  I like this.  I also bought dark glue to keep these on and I realized that to wear these i will need a marker-like eyeliner to line my eyes with afterwards to cover the lines from the binding of the lashes.  I had to trim both sides also because of the excess  strip that  held the lashes in the container they came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over all they are most natural looking but do require a bit of work to apply correctly and to trim the ends so there is not a bunch sticking off the ends.</li>
    <li> I had to cut them a little from the inner corner in order to make them look more suddle, but other than that I liked them. They aren&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve bought but they are a good for the price I bought them for and they are better than the ones I got the last time from amozon which were more like a plastic material. These are soft and more natural.</li>
    <li> Very soft and natural looking!</li>
    <li> Does not look how it looks on here at all they don&#x27;t look natural</li>
