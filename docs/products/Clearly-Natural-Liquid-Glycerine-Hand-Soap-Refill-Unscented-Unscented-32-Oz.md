      <li>I love this soap.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the soap, I just wish I could buy it in a bigger size.</li>
      <li>I have been using Glycerin Soap for years, but most of the stores that I used to buy it from, doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>More words ...  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to so many soaps and smells.  </li>
      <li>This was not fragrance free - it has a very strong &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>It burned my face, and the peppermint smell was way too strong.  </li>
      <li>Great soap; cleans well but does not dry out my hands.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great not having so many long and incomprehensible words listed as ingredients.</li>
      <li>Glycerin benefits me and being unscented is important because fragrances often give me headaches.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t say how much (% percentage) of the proceeds goes to this fund... or whether they send their own product... rather ambiguous, but</li>
      <li>The refill bottle of natural soap arrived in good condition and was as advertised.</li>
      <li>but I do love this soap, particularly given my allergy to many fragrances.</li>
      <li>No additives and rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>But I had difficulty in finding ready-made shampoos that would actually clean well.</li>
      <li>and I feel so clean after using it.</li>
      <li>But still , if you are sensitive to any kind of smells this soap can be not for you.</li>
      <li>This product really came in handy when I needed gentle cleansing after radiation burn.  </li>
      <li>Store owners, if it goes out of stock that quick... inventory more!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I am pleased by this product, very well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Product came quickly and was as described/expected.</li>
      <li>I order this hand soap regularly and am very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this soap to anyone who wants a good quality and low cost liquid soap.  </li>
      <li>use both liquid and bar versions, great stuff, especially if you are sensitive or allergic to perfumes in your soap.</li>
      <li>Love the natural product.  </li>
      <li>but well worth it.  </li>
      <li>At best they try putting the bottles inside large zip-locks, but that neither successfully contains the mess or helps the recipient with the broken bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for washing my hands with a baby who has eczema and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry the skin even with my frequent hand washing.</li>
      <li>Most people would most likely not react like I do to the new ingredients, but people should be aware that the formula has changed.</li>
      <li>What a pure and gentle clean.  </li>
      <li>I find the price to be much more reasonable than other natural soaps, in fact I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything comparable.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to the most common &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; used in most soaps and cosmetics.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to moisturize with a conditioner after washing, but commercial conditioners do not contain sodium laurel sulfate, as do most commercial shampoos.</li>
      <li>I still have a great deal left over that I am going to use for a variety of other things.</li>
      <li>This soap is about as pure as they come.</li>
      <li>fragrances/odors when I can&#x27;t really smell them).  </li>
      <li>There are 2 obvious discrepancies from the original:</li>
      <li>initially bought the soap in its original dispenser bottle, and then, bought this product to refill it.</li>
      <li>I refill my smaller container with it to keep the counter clutterless and clean.</li>
      <li>In early 2013, they began adding a slight rose scent to the soap.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather particularly well</li>
      <li>I am highly allergic to scent and purchased this Glycerine soap to refill some containers.  </li>
      <li>takes a little more rubbing to get a lather</li>
      <li>Naturally, it doesn&#x27;t foam much, but</li>
      <li>We really like this natural product.</li>
      <li>In short, this is economical and healthier for my hair and skin, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
      <li>In Dec 2011, I ordered my yearly $60+ worth of Clearly Natural unscented glycerin liquid soap refills directly from Clearly Natural online</li>
      <li>I mixed it with a lot of freshly ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>I began searching for a product with which to make my own shampoo and liquid hand soap, after I started having trouble with my sodium laurel sulfate shampoo (hair loss, which has lessened considerably after using natural products).</li>
      <li>and I broke out in hives and itches after one use of the new product.   </li>
      <li>New Formula:  Water, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, (OLEIC ACID), Glycerin, (ALKYL POLYGLUCOSIDE), (POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE), Sodium Chloride, glycine, (ALOE BARBADENSIS), (TOCHOPEROL ACETATE).   </li>
      <li>The soap is very thick--well worth the little patience it takes to refill the bottle.</li>
      <li>This clear hand soap has almost no odor and works great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Old Formula:  Water, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarconsinate, Potassium Oleate, Glycine.   </li>
      <li>and he won&#x27;t have this chemical in his house as they have a young child.  </li>
      <li>We have extremely sensitive skin including sufferers of eczema and severe psoriasis.</li>
      <li>Sensitive skin and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s everything I wanted in a hand soap - natural, unscented and contains glycerine.  </li>
      <li>This handsoap is natural and not harsh.  </li>
      <li>Is just the right thickness to work well in my dispensers, takes very little to do the job, and I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it how actually large a bottle I was getting for my money.  </li>
      <li>I can purchase large bottles of in a store (a rare occurrence for me, but the multiple shipping disasters with the reviewed soap have broken my trust in people&#x27;s ability to package large bottles of liquid).</li>
      <li>I have used this soap for several years, grateful for the lack of fragrance as I am very sensitive to scented products.  </li>
      <li>I just spent an hour cleaning up the latest mess, before having to discard the product!</li>
      <li>opt for the smaller bottles as they do not contain \\&quot;bonus\\&quot; (or \\&quot;bogus\\&quot;) ingredients that your sensitive hands may have difficulty tolerating.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used it for washing my hands.  </li>
      <li>and it does have a kind of weird smell to it.  </li>
      <li>At least you&#x27;ll be helping the \\&quot;Clean the World\\&quot; charity \\&quot;donate soap to stop the spread of preventable diseases around the world\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It also does not dry my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am allergic to the most common &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; used in most soaps and cosmetics. Too me they smell itchy and thick, frankly, stink.  So very pleased to find unscented.</li>
    <li> I order this hand soap regularly and am very pleased with it.  It&#x27;s everything I wanted in a hand soap - natural, unscented and contains glycerine.  I have less problem with dry and cracking skin since using this product. I find the price to be much more reasonable than other natural soaps, in fact I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything comparable.  I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The refill bottle of natural soap arrived in good condition and was as advertised. It&#x27;s great not having so many long and incomprehensible words listed as ingredients. The soap is very thick--well worth the little patience it takes to refill the bottle.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended I was my hands with glycerine soap before handling my contacts. I had a hard time finding an unscented, liquid glycerin until I stumbled upon Clearly Natural. I&#x27;m very happy with the soap, I just wish I could buy it in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  No additives and rinses clean.  I think there is less accumulated soap scum too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Glycerin Soap for years, but most of the stores that I used to buy it from, doesn&#x27;t carry it any more. Lately I had been getting it from Trader Joes, but they also stopped carrying it.  They replaced it with something else, which they said was the same thing made out of natural ingredients, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t Glycerin Soap!  It burned my face, and the peppermint smell was way too strong.  I finally found this liquid Glycerin Soap on Amazon&#x27;s web site, and ordered it. This is a really good unscented liquid Glycerin Soap!  Thank you Amazon for carrying this!</li>
    <li> My family enjoys this product.  We have extremely sensitive skin including sufferers of eczema and severe psoriasis. This product works for frequent hand washing without harsh chemicals, dyes, or scents. The best product I have found.</li>
    <li> The best hand soap.  I am allergic to so many soaps and smells.  This works well for me without all the chemicals.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite soap for just about everything, even recommended to friends and family. However, in three separate shipments the bottles I received had an extremely strong and unpleasant smell; almost like an entire perfume bottle had been mixed in. I don&#x27;t know if it indicates an extreme mix-up during manufacture or some breakdown process, but after the experience of returning one bottle to receive an equally bad replacement, I&#x27;ve just given up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the default seller of this product completely fails to package the bottle correctly, resulting in it arriving ruptured roughly 1/4 times. This usually creates a terrible experience for both the delivery person (goo seeping out into the truck), random people (mystery goo on their packages), and the recipient (100% wasted purchase plus cleanup). I gave the company feedback every time I asked for a replacement, but not once did I see a variation in how they attempt to ship such a massive bottle. At best they try putting the bottles inside large zip-locks, but that neither successfully contains the mess or helps the recipient with the broken bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since switched to using Softsoap, which while still annoyingly perfumed, appears to be the least offensive of the brands I can purchase large bottles of in a store (a rare occurrence for me, but the multiple shipping disasters with the reviewed soap have broken my trust in people&#x27;s ability to package large bottles of liquid).</li>
    <li> I have been a devoted Clearly Natural unscented glycerin liquid soap user for the past 6+ years because I have severe sensitive skin and severe eczema.  I can&#x27;t use Dove, Ivory, Aveeno, any other soaps that I know of even if they are labelled as \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot;    In Dec 2011, I ordered my yearly $60+ worth of Clearly Natural unscented glycerin liquid soap refills directly from Clearly Natural online and I broke out in hives and itches after one use of the new product.   Old Formula:  Water, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarconsinate, Potassium Oleate, Glycine.   New Formula:  Water, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, (OLEIC ACID), Glycerin, (ALKYL POLYGLUCOSIDE), (POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE), Sodium Chloride, glycine, (ALOE BARBADENSIS), (TOCHOPEROL ACETATE).   Most people would most likely not react like I do to the new ingredients, but people should be aware that the formula has changed.</li>
    <li> If your hands are dry and you wash them often, this is the one you want...</li>
    <li> Purchased this product because I have psoriasis.  Glycerin benefits me and being unscented is important because fragrances often give me headaches.  So far, I&#x27;ve only used it for washing my hands.  When I&#x27;ve used up my body wash I&#x27;ll be using it in the shower.  More words ...  No, after all, it&#x27;s soap.  What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> I am highly allergic to scent and purchased this Glycerine soap to refill some containers.  It has no scent what-so-ever--not even a slight chemical smell.  It is thick and foams well.  I enjoyed using it and gave part of the bottle to my daughter.  My son-in-law, a chemical engineer, had her throw it out because it was made from petroleum and he won&#x27;t have this chemical in his house as they have a young child.  Although I liked it, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Sensitive skin and this is the only soap I can use.  Even Ivory has chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a serial purchaser of this soap. It&#x27;s great for washing my hands with a baby who has eczema and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry the skin even with my frequent hand washing.</li>
    <li> Nice liquid soap. Totally scent free, and as others have said, thick enough not to splash out of the dispenser.  I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> use both liquid and bar versions, great stuff, especially if you are sensitive or allergic to perfumes in your soap.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for liquid glycerin soap, this product will suffice. Also, there&#x27;s no scent, at least that I can detect, if no scent is what you want. it does the job that I expected.</li>
    <li> This was not fragrance free - it has a very strong &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell. I made bubble bath with this, and even with fragrance added, it still smelled like soap. Not buying this again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; safe</li>
    <li> I began searching for a product with which to make my own shampoo and liquid hand soap, after I started having trouble with my sodium laurel sulfate shampoo (hair loss, which has lessened considerably after using natural products). But I had difficulty in finding ready-made shampoos that would actually clean well. After researching, I found this, and I mix it with a little \\&quot;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Castile Soap\\&quot; (about 5 parts glycerine to one part Dr. Bronners -- it&#x27;s concentrated -- to one part water). This cleans my hair as well as the traditional shampoos but without the chemicals. I have noticed a difference in hair loss, as have two of my friends who switched. Their hair is short, and they use Yardley soap, but mine is long so I need something a little less drying. It&#x27;s important to moisturize with a conditioner after washing, but commercial conditioners do not contain sodium laurel sulfate, as do most commercial shampoos. In short, this is economical and healthier for my hair and skin, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Great product for those needing unscented products as I do.</li>
    <li> Delivered in a timely manner. Wrapped well.  Product itself is great to use. Safe and non toxic. I recommend both the product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> We are a scentless family, so this is a must and works well!  I refill my smaller container with it to keep the counter clutterless and clean.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any scent at all (I have asthma and can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; fragrances/odors when I can&#x27;t really smell them).  Is just the right thickness to work well in my dispensers, takes very little to do the job, and I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it how actually large a bottle I was getting for my money.  Great value.</li>
    <li> This soap is about as pure as they come. It feels good on the skin and cleans well. Naturally, it doesn&#x27;t foam much, but that&#x27;s to be expected. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This product was expensive for the amount you get in the bottle.  It was unscented as advertised but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I need a liquid hand soap that is unscented and this is the best on the market in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My hands feel less dry.</li>
    <li> The soap is okay.  It doesn&#x27;t lather particularly well and it does have a kind of weird smell to it.  I mixed it with a lot of freshly ground cinnamon and maybe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s keeping it from lathering up as well as I would like.</li>
    <li> Great soap; cleans well but does not dry out my hands.  I have many allergies, fragrance being just one.  The bottle arrived promptly, no spillage.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I use it as a bath soap and I feel so clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I USED TO BUY &amp;#34;TRADER JOES&amp;#34; GLYCERIN SOAP, TJ STOPPED SELLING IT AND IT WAS A GREAT  FOR GREASY HANDS AND DISHES.</li>
    <li> Same type of soap as the much more expensive Nutrogena.  I filled the shower dispensers in my bathroom and it is great.</li>
    <li> This handsoap is natural and not harsh.  I was so happy to find this on Amazon at a good price.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
    <li> This product really came in handy when I needed gentle cleansing after radiation burn.  It did not harm my skin and cleaned the burned area.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to find unscented glycerine soap in stores anymore, since Trader Joe&#x27;s discontinued theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone who has problems with scented products.  It&#x27;s great soap.</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own bath soap.  Glycerin is a moisturizer.  Love the natural product.  Price is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap hoping that it would not have any smell to it( because of allergies). But it has some smell to it. Of course, It doesn&#x27;t smell like any of those smells: vanilla, coconut, strawberry... But still , if you are sensitive to any kind of smells this soap can be not for you.</li>
    <li> What a pure and gentle clean.  I would like to experience a slight scent.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this soap to anyone who wants a good quality and low cost liquid soap.  I love it</li>
    <li> This is great. I&#x27;ll buy these 32 oz replacement bottles of the unscented glycerine soap again.</li>
    <li> Cleans well without fragrance. Two qualities I prefer in a soap. Inexpensive too.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for several years, grateful for the lack of fragrance as I am very sensitive to scented products.  In early 2013, they began adding a slight rose scent to the soap.  After several complaints, the company has changed the formulation to remove the phenylethyl alcohol ingredient that had a fragrance.  By the end of May, 2013, they should be shipping truly unscented soap again.  The company responded to consumer complaints and is committed to providing an excellent liquid soap without fragrance.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. It states unscented. It smells like Musty smelly feet! THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED NOW!</li>
    <li> Unscented....can still have a scent. However, after using several times, I realized the scent did not remain after rinsing. I am and will continue to use this soap. It also does not dry my skin.</li>
    <li> Have used for years due to my sensitive and oily skin. It says hand soap, but this goes to my face. And it works.</li>
    <li> This clear hand soap has almost no odor and works great.&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble finding the containers in the local stores as they are always out of stock of the unscented. I know why, when I find it in stock I buy 4 or 5 of them and leave one on the shelf for the next person. Store owners, if it goes out of stock that quick... inventory more!&lt;br /&gt;Now I found this refill I will only need the small containers if the pump breaks!&lt;br /&gt;Note; If your pump clogs turn it upside down and run hot water over the nozzle, it may just be dried soap hanging in the opening!</li>
    <li> Why is this item 45% more expensive per ounce  than if you purchase the smaller pump bottles?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only learned this after ordering. If you like this soap, order the smaller pump dispenser version, it&#x27;s way cheaper, plus you get dispensers.</li>
    <li> Was thinking this was the same as the bar glycerin soap and isn&#x27;t. Leaves soap scum behind and doesn&#x27;t cleanse your hands. Very disappointed in this product ;(</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and was as described/expected. I used it as an ingredient in a home made body scrub I gave as Christmas gifts. I still have a great deal left over that I am going to use for a variety of other things. I like that it is unscented because I am able to add whatever scents (at whatever strength) I wish to it via essential oil. I am pleased by this product, very well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this. I add my doTERRA essential oils to it and use it as bath gel.</li>
    <li> Unscented and basically stinks</li>
    <li> takes a little more rubbing to get a lather but well worth it.  really not even necessary to get a big lather.</li>
    <li> I noticed another reviewer that stated the \\&quot;formula has changed\\&quot;... well, now it&#x27;s changed AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought the soap in its original dispenser bottle, and then, bought this product to refill it. There are 2 obvious discrepancies from the original: Phenylethyl Alcohol and Ethyhexylglycerin. The formula is noticeably thinner, and there is a stronger fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to love this soap because I was seeing improvement in my cracked, and peeling hands... but now (since refilling my soap dispenser), I&#x27;ve returned to that terrible state where my hands are raw and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to buy this soap, opt for the smaller bottles as they do not contain \\&quot;bonus\\&quot; (or \\&quot;bogus\\&quot;) ingredients that your sensitive hands may have difficulty tolerating. If that&#x27;s a non-issue for you, buy this product anyway. At least you&#x27;ll be helping the \\&quot;Clean the World\\&quot; charity \\&quot;donate soap to stop the spread of preventable diseases around the world\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t say how much (% percentage) of the proceeds goes to this fund... or whether they send their own product... rather ambiguous, but y&#x27;know, whatever helps you sleep at night (despite the rashes on your hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I received this product on time and intact. No puncture holes or crushed bottles. +2 stars for not giving me anything else to gripe about.</li>
    <li> We really like this natural product.</li>
    <li> I know that&#x27;s a silly headline, but I do love this soap, particularly given my allergy to many fragrances. However, I&#x27;ve ordered it twice from Amazon, and both times the bottles were broken and the inside of the box was a thick, slimy mess. I just spent an hour cleaning up the latest mess, before having to discard the product! To their credit, Amazon was very kind about refunding the money and apologizing profusely, etc. but, seriously, why offer a product via shipping that clearly cannot be shipped because it&#x27;s in a fragile plastic bottle with a cap that is not (inexplicably) sealed? I figured the first time was just a mishap, but the second time was much worse - two broken bottles rather than one. Obviously, there will not be a third time.</li>
