    <li> Every time I got a thin spot I have used this and after a couple of weeks I can see results very nice product</li>
    <li> I really like the drops and believe they have helped my hair to regrow!</li>
    <li> I love this product it does everything my beautician said it would.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the rush order that was put upon the order..especially the cost was affordable</li>
    <li> Shipped extremely fast (one day later). Love this!! Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3 months and I have seen growth. O will keep using it for several more monhs.</li>
    <li> Great product and thanks AMAZON for offering this product since their not available locally. Therefore,I have notice some growth around hairline where hair was shedding and thinning. Been using for about 2 months now and will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I purchased the scalp recovery because I had a bad problem with itching.  Since using it, the itching has subsided tremendously.</li>

    <li> Product really works I have been using it for better than 3 months and have received the expected results and would recommend it</li>
    <li> Using for about a month.  I apply 1/2 dropper everyday to the affected area.  Hair has grown back in, still need to see more progress and how long it lasts before I can I advise of long term results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! My edges do not do well with braids... but I got braids anyway... and they damaged my edges. I got this from my hair dresser and it cost me $50 at the salon. I thought it was  totally worth it because my edges started growing back in within a week or so of me using the product and were almost fully recovered within about 6 weeks. When I found it on Amazon for 1/4 the price I was over the moon. I also use the product on my god daughter&#x27;s hair. Her edges are sensitive to braiding as well. The shipping was really quick and the seller included additional product samples with my order!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as indicated, came enclosed in bubble wrap almost missed it as it&#x27;s a very small bottle it&#x27;s $$$ for being so small. I got this after a friend of a friend gave rave review about it but, I have used it now for 10 days and yet to see any change on my hairline so I am giving it 2 stars. It probably doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but if I see dramatic change in a 1-2months, I will update my review.</li>
    <li> Great product so far.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist told m aout this product and I really love it and wll be getting more of it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference but it was recommended by a friend who had success so I tried it.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product long enough to make a comment on does it grow and thicken the hairline.  But I can say that it make my scalp feel great.  My scalp feels cool when I apply the serum.  I will rate another review after 6 months.  That should be long enough to know if I see any hairline results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING</li>
    <li> I just started using it so far so good. I see little fuzz ball (lol) growing.I&#x27;ll give it 60 days before I determine if it really work.</li>
    <li> The best product for thinning hair......I finally have my hairline back.  Worth every drop in the little bottle. Love it</li>
    <li> This product totally exceeded</li>
    <li> Excellent product for balding.</li>
    <li> So far everything looks good. Hopefully my thin areas will fill in. If it continues to do well I will order more. Does it come in a larger bottle?</li>
    <li> Good product it really works, will buy again</li>
    <li> Great Product, it did help and I have thicker hair in the area where I was thinning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two bottles and I didn&#x27;t see any results. Overpriced For the small bottle. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
