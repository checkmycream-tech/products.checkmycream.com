      <li>Gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>this didn&#x27;t color my hair as well as i would have liked but worked</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>accurate color, just need a good developer to go with it</li>
      <li>True to detail!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every toner out there to find the best, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Just make sure</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t go to a salon to pay out the nose for something you can do better yourself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than toner.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love the color and how it turned out as I hoped</li>
      <li>Love Wella</li>
      <li>Color achieved :)</li>
      <li>yep I gotta get some more dye here soon.</li>
      <li>So glad to purchase this online than drive to the store to get it.</li>
      <li>ok i guess probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Color Oops had pulled out most of the orange.</li>
      <li>makes my hair silver gray love it will buy more</li>
      <li>you are left with gorgeous snowy locks!</li>
      <li>developer on my super light bleached hair (left it for about 25minutes), and came out with some awesome steel-gray hair.  </li>
      <li>so I was pleased to be able to get online for such a good price.</li>
      <li>and so the contrast was becoming too great, not to mention having alot of brassy ends and streaks that used to be low lites.  </li>
      <li>This dye gives you a great gray colour, only in orange lighting.</li>
      <li>It then turns to an interesting steel gray before reaching a gorgeous ash white blond two weeks out.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to get the right developer for it</li>
      <li>very accurate very fast</li>
      <li>It will come out a bit darker, but it will look better and more realistic, believe me.  </li>
      <li>The result is a really nice,  natural looking color.  </li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>blonde ash nice n easy.  </li>
      <li>OOps to pull out some color instead of bleach to lighten it, since the ends are already damaged from straightening, and it did lighten most of the top layers, all of which became very yellow, and some orange.</li>
      <li>a week later when i went back with 050 cooling violet, the color turned out to be totally perfect.</li>
      <li>I love Wella products, always high quality.</li>
      <li>Brings my bleached blonde to a more attractive ash blonde with a 20 developer.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous steel grey color!</li>
      <li>I have to do a new application about once every 3 weeks, but it&#x27;s so much better than dying.</li>
      <li>It really removed all brassiness!!  </li>
      <li>Really works great, now my hair is silver grey!</li>
      <li>If I get more adventurous I might give the ends a trim and some deep conditioning then bleach some out and make them pure silver.</li>
      <li>(Pastels wash out real fast</li>
      <li>but it was worth it to avoid damaging bleach.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve come to the right place.</li>
      <li>so I spent hundreds of dollars on trying to change my hair color from warm to cool.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color on hair.</li>
      <li>Love this and have used it for years since 3 different colorists recommended it.</li>
      <li>Try it first using 3 capfuls.  </li>
      <li>either way, i&#x27;m definitely going to get some more and dye my hair with it again.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not really afraid of processing too much.</li>
      <li>Worked well at first dye it&#x27;s bluish after the first wash faded to silver</li>
      <li>Comes out looking like perfectly light brown ashy natural hair.</li>
      <li>(that gives more a silvery white, pure 18 more Snow White) and I always add a capful or two of 050 cooling violet.</li>
      <li>It makes an \\&quot;ash\\&quot; blonde shade much more realistic.  </li>
      <li>It will just make your ash blonde shade a litte bit darker and more realistic.  </li>
      <li>first, my stylist used ash blonde after bleaching my hair, which was just too light for me--</li>
      <li>It seems that going to lavender first and letting it fade out gets your hair to a better white, while going straight to the color you want will simply cause it to fade a bit more yellow when it settles.</li>
      <li>I add the entire bottle in a light brown/</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>comes out a light grayish ashy blonde.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do it myself, and bleached my hair a couple of levels to get it light enough that it would tone</li>
      <li>So after trying so much ashy stuff in deeper levels (6, 7)</li>
      <li>after so many tries, wouldn&#x27;t you understand that my hair is so damaged that it would not  take any color?  </li>
      <li>Which I very quickly bleached out and thankfully the color pulled quickly and went back to my original white blonde.</li>
      <li>It turned my hair slightly blue the first few days, but it&#x27;s faded to a nice silver.</li>
      <li>Give it good time to color your hair, as much time as you would give your usual blonde shade.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I  understand that hair professional go to school and know a little more than me about the hair.</li>
      <li>Besides be light enough the hair must be porous enough.</li>
      <li>Natural brunette here on a quest for the whitest hair!</li>
      <li>Not sure if this will wash out, but the gold is gone for sure.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s bleach labeled and sold as dye turning my hair yellow up top other colors on the bottom which resulted in me having to buy bleach to strip it</li>
      <li>It kind of darkens it at first, but after your next wash, you notice that the darker ash color is gone and it leaves your color such as blonde streaks or highlights less brassy.</li>
      <li>Nice item, hard to find locally</li>
      <li>It shows on the box clear not  grayish violet...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s keeping my hair at my natural color so that it can grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My natural shade is gray/white</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>(I used their services around 10 times and  changed the professional 2 times)</li>
      <li>&quot; I would need to see a professional.</li>
      <li>I left the 2:1 mixture on the whole head for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used a cap full of this in a mixture of my other toners - T18 and T14 - and viola!</li>
      <li>If I had left it on a little less, it would be silver, but I&#x27;m so happy with this toner; if you&#x27;re looking for silver hair, I totally recommend this.</li>
      <li>This is great for toning down the yellow,  red, and orange in my very dark brown hair when I lighten it to a light brown/really dark blonde.</li>
      <li>then we&#x27;ve tried light brown, dark blonde, etc.</li>
      <li>I bought this product earlier this year and experimented several times by using it mixed with a light shade of blonde.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended product for counteracting brassiness and yellow.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product!  Wish I had found it years ago.</li>
    <li> Did its job and toned out the yellow. I added two capfuls to a 10N permanent hair dye.</li>
    <li> If you are having problems with brassy tones, this is the stuff you need! My well water leaves my hair red or gold and every once in a while I use this as a toner. You will not leave it on long when used as a toner. It kind of darkens it at first, but after your next wash, you notice that the darker ash color is gone and it leaves your color such as blonde streaks or highlights less brassy. Love this and have used it for years since 3 different colorists recommended it.</li>
    <li> True to detail!! It&#x27;s a pretty color on hair.</li>
    <li> Matches the online picture color and was a speedy shipment. Just make sure to get the right developer for it</li>
    <li> Wanted a dark gray color and this does the trick.  Can blend with other shades for different effects.</li>
    <li> It darkened my hair with a gray tint. Not sure if this will wash out, but the gold is gone for sure. I just have gray blonde hair now. I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> After a major catastrophy with ( DCash 1490 ) that&#x27;s bleach labeled and sold as dye turning my hair yellow up top other colors on the bottom which resulted in me having to buy bleach to strip it out.after, bleaching I waited a couple days to let my hair rest, White dye was sold out so I got the palest blonde they had, Wella T18 and Wella 050 Cooling Violet, I added 2 cap fulls of the T18 toner to the pale blonde dye, then tested it on a piece of hair it came out whitish without the yellow yay.It also has that nice beach babe in the sun look without the yellow or brassiness I hate so much and looks very natural.   2nd test   I took some of the same pale blonde dye mixed in less than 1 half cap full of the Wella 050 cooling violet to a bottle comes out a light grayish ashy blonde. It also eliminates the yellow, now I can restore my hair to it&#x27;s natural silvery state. Also mix this the same way with white dye gets a silvery white looking color, hair holds the color well, after shampooing I found that it left my hair silky soft shiny too, yep I gotta get some more dye here soon. Thank you fellow reviewers because of your great reviews I tried this am hooked on it I&#x27;m a Wella girl now lol, smiles</li>
    <li> The color did not turn out as pictured.....really dark not (silver at all) with hints of purple...I will chalk this up to lesson learned....</li>
    <li> This product washed out in 2 days, which disappointed me so much because I didn&#x27;t have time to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Works well.</li>
    <li> It turned my hair slightly blue the first few days, but it&#x27;s faded to a nice silver. I really like it. I have no idea how it would work for just taking brassy tones out of hair.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Very nice color however it only last till the 2nd wash:(</li>
    <li> Not even close in the color grey I wanted. Not even sliver or off grey mist.</li>
    <li> Regarding T-18 White Lady&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally straight black (I&#x27;m half Japanese), but I&#x27;ve had my hair pure snow white multiple times now. I&#x27;ve tried just about every toner out there to find the best, and this is by far my favorite. While I wish the less damaging toners would work, the use of developer and chemical process of this one is what makes the toner really WORK. Personally, I prefer leaving the toner on until my hair is lavender and within a wash or two my hair is white. It seems that going to lavender first and letting it fade out gets your hair to a better white, while going straight to the color you want will simply cause it to fade a bit more yellow when it settles.</li>
    <li> Cooling violet is often used as a crabber used with tints to minimize red tones. I do not recommend using this alone. I sometimes use a half ounce of it with one ounce silver lady for a smokey silver tone. For any silver blonding you MUST bleach to a very pale yellow,regardless of any natural color. Besides be light enough the hair must be porous enough. If I can help let me know</li>
    <li> Worked wonders for me!! My hair was orange as I&#x27;m going from brown to blonde.  I used Volume 10 developer instead of recommended 20 ( 1 part cooling violet 2 parts 10 volume developer). Kept  in for 20 minutes. It really removed all brassiness!!  very happy. Hope it will work for you too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stress it enough, if you are looking for the &amp;#34;granny hair&amp;#34; siver/grey look you&#x27;ve come to the right place. Of course you will need to lighten your hair first, you can use this alone (even though it says it is an additive) and just mix with 20v developer and leave in for about half an hour and you will have luscious grey hair!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the toner. So glad to purchase this online than drive to the store to get it.</li>
    <li> makes my hair silver gray love it will buy more I use it with a mixture of white lady</li>
    <li> I used this to make my hair not orange when I went blond. I love Wella products, always high quality. Just make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> Long time ago  I bleached my hair an damaged it in a serious way.  I am a blonde, so  at one point of my life  i decided  I am not blonde enough, so I bleached it. (what a stupid mistake)Bleaching especially when done unprofessionally turn your hair brassy and give it a warm undercolor. so I spent hundreds of dollars on trying to change my hair color from warm to cool. None of the so-called hair professionals who take 100 dollar for color job couldn&#x27;t help me and every time colored my hair in brown or orange or  yellow.  When I asked them to  give  my hair a blue undercolor, so it would cancel the red/orange, they would look at me and say: \\&quot;you don&#x27;t wanna be blue\\&quot;. Well,  I don&#x27;t. after so many tries, wouldn&#x27;t you understand that my hair is so damaged that it would not  take any color?  So  after their&#x27; another fail, I decided I will do it myself.  I bought the color remover and this permanent dye (cooling violet). Came home,first applied the  remover (after that one I become very red, just the way it should&#x27;ve been ) and applied this  cooling violet. And I got just  what I wanted.  I  understand that hair professional go to school and know a little more than me about the hair. But why couldn&#x27;t they achieve what I have achieved? why do I have to pay $1000 (I used their services around 10 times and  changed the professional 2 times) before I do it myself?</li>
    <li> This is a weak dye. Makes up for its price, I guess; or maybe its just me. This dye gives you a great gray colour, only in orange lighting. When you are under white lighting there is an ugly green tint to it. I left it on for 25-30mins and after just washing it once, the color is already fading. Soon it turned to a green blond with just washing with just conditioner. When using this color, you should have the palest blonde. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people who have bleached orange hair.</li>
    <li> Worked well at first dye it&#x27;s bluish after the first wash faded to silver</li>
    <li> This is great for toning down the yellow,  red, and orange in my very dark brown hair when I lighten it to a light brown/really dark blonde. I add the entire bottle in a light brown/really dark blonde ash nice n easy.  The result is a really nice,  natural looking color.  With out this, my hair turns orange when I lighten it.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous steel grey color!</li>
    <li> I got this from my aunt who works at a salon and used it not so long ago and I absolutely love the color and how it turned out as I hoped</li>
    <li> very accurate very fast</li>
    <li> Love Wella this toner is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Well I needed a one step color to lighten my dark brown roots and at the same time tone down the brass on my highlighted brown/blonde ends. This did a beautiful job! My end result was a uniform ash medium brown tone and where the highlights were lightest ash brown tones. Gorgeous. I have gotten lots of compliments. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> accurate color, just need a good developer to go with it</li>
    <li> does what it promises.  Good for correcting bad color jobs (too brassy) and for in-between coloring appointments.  you need to use this with 20-vol. developer or it won&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally dirty blonde, and I have dyed it dark brown for years (6-7). Finally this year I decided I wanted to go back to my natural color, and that to \\&quot;do it right,\\&quot; I would need to see a professional. I told her, DO NOT LEAVE ANY BRASSY TONES IN MY HAIR. No reds, oranges, golds. She used a toner to try to counteract this but it did not work at all. My hair was still auburn. I spent $400 with her in two visits to get a product that I was very disappointed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do it myself, and bleached my hair a couple of levels to get it light enough that it would tone (NOTE: These toners do not work well on dark hair. If your hair isn&#x27;t taking it, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s too dark. Lighten it a few levels and try again). I tried Wella silver lady toner (T14) which did a little but not a lot, and washed out in about a week. I was also using purple shampoo, purple mousse, etc. everything I could to inject violet dyes in my hair to counteract the brass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I decided to just use this \\&quot;additive.\\&quot; Mixed it with 10 vol. developer to reduce damage, and left it in for 7 minutes (heard rumors about turning hair purple). Washed it out and my hair was dirty blonde for the first time in 7 years. Incredible. I have been using it ever since. I have to do a new application about once every 3 weeks, but it&#x27;s so much better than dying. It&#x27;s keeping my hair at my natural color so that it can grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried everything else and are about to throw in the towel, TRY THIS. It&#x27;s better than toner. Don&#x27;t go to a salon to pay out the nose for something you can do better yourself.</li>
    <li> Brings my bleached blonde to a more attractive ash blonde with a 20 developer. If you use the whole bottle, you&#x27;ll have violet hair for a few washings. It then turns to an interesting steel gray before reaching a gorgeous ash white blond two weeks out. I could use less at a time, but I like the fun violet color. Half a bottle would probably get me to a white ash blond without waiting for it to fade. Highly recommended product for counteracting brassiness and yellow.</li>
    <li> i wanted silver grey hair, but i&#x27;m a natural dirty blonde. first, my stylist used ash blonde after bleaching my hair, which was just too light for me-- a week later when i went back with 050 cooling violet, the color turned out to be totally perfect. it was a dark steel gray, which was exactly what i&#x27;d wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to my hair that well. maybe it&#x27;s because i didn&#x27;t wash my hair before dying it the second time, or maybe i wash too often and it fades? either way, i&#x27;m definitely going to get some more and dye my hair with it again. great color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product . Dont over use it</li>
    <li> This review is for COOLING VIOLET:  I add about half a bottle every time I color my hair, because I pull red. My daughter has at least medium brown hair if not dark brown, but has been dyeing blonde for a long time.  she wanted to let her natural color grow out but still get highlights - problem is, every time it grows out and salonist doesn&#x27;t start the highlight close enough to the crown....then we&#x27;ve tried light brown, dark blonde, etc. and it always comes out reddish or brassy. NOT IF YOU ADD COOLING VIOLET!  Comes out looking like perfectly light brown ashy natural hair. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I put this in my very light blonde almost white hair for the time recommended on the back and it turned my hair a very dark blue with patches of blueish grey. Which I very quickly bleached out and thankfully the color pulled quickly and went back to my original white blonde.</li>
    <li> This product has produced the expected results. The color is consistent  and saturates the hair evenly, giving subtle highlights related to natural hair color variations.</li>
    <li> Really works great, now my hair is silver grey! Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product earlier this year and experimented several times by using it mixed with a light shade of blonde.  It gives a good result:  it drabs down the color, making it look less false and brassy.  I will never color my hair again without adding this violet shade.  It makes an \\&quot;ash\\&quot; blonde shade much more realistic.  Try it first using 3 capfuls.  I have got to the point where I just add a glug or two of this to my ash blonde shade.  No, it won&#x27;t turn your hair violet.  It will just make your ash blonde shade a litte bit darker and more realistic.  My natural shade is gray/white and so I have to leave the color on longer than I used to do.  When the color is sitting on your head you start to wonder, is it too dark?  No, it&#x27;s not too dark.  Give it good time to color your hair, as much time as you would give your usual blonde shade.  It will come out a bit darker, but it will look better and more realistic, believe me.  I have been coloring my hair since 1995 and finding this violet shade has been a major breakthrough for me.  Good luck and happy coloring.</li>
    <li> It shows on the box clear not  grayish violet...I thought it was a different color....false photo here?&lt;br /&gt;I should return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and have been using Color Silk medium golden brown on my roots and as low lites for at least 4 years (permanent color before that), so my natural shade is long gone. My roots in front are now 80% silver and so the contrast was becoming too great, not to mention having alot of brassy ends and streaks that used to be low lites.  Now that gray is in vogue, I&#x27;ll be growing mine out, and I like the way the streaks around my face look, so my goal was to emphasize the streaks starting at the hair line and de-emphasize the roots contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my plan... I used Color OOps to pull out some color instead of bleach to lighten it, since the ends are already damaged from straightening, and it did lighten most of the top layers, all of which became very yellow, and some orange. Color Oops had pulled out most of the orange. What a drag to have to rinse that stuff out for 20+ minutes! but it was worth it to avoid damaging bleach.  Next day I applied Violet 50 mixed with T18 in 2:1 ratio with 2X as much 20 developer. The strand test I did with 50 alone didn&#x27;t tone down the yellow ends, and leaving it on 30 minutes left a green cast. I left the 2:1 mixture on the whole head for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result: Wow. NO brass left, the violets softened  the old brown so that the root contrast is mellowed. My silver roots are shining, and there are individual hairs throughtout that picked up the silver, so now I can grow out the silver/gray while keeping it blended with the old toned-down brown. If I get more adventurous I might give the ends a trim and some deep conditioning then bleach some out and make them pure silver. Woo hoo! Bye bye brass head with nasty roots.

    <li> this didn&#x27;t color my hair as well as i would have liked but worked ok i guess probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Update: I had unfortunate red (not orange, like dull red) tones that would not leave my hair a nice lightest brown no matter how hard I tried. It&#x27;s naturally dark brown but I&#x27;d had bleach and red and it stained. So after trying so much ashy stuff in deeper levels (6, 7) I thought I had this laying around anyway why not try it. I used on dry unwashed hair w 20 vol for 30 min and I swear to god it worked!!! My hair is now perfect light ash brown!!!  Natural brunette here on a quest for the whitest hair! My hair is either white, whitish silver, or the palest pastel pink depending on the week. (Pastels wash out real fast and I have to keep the base very light). I have a pixie cut so I&#x27;m not really afraid of processing too much. After bleaching, when the expected pale yellow happens, I use either t18 or a combo of 18/14 (that gives more a silvery white, pure 18 more Snow White) and I always add a capful or two of 050 cooling violet. I maintain with semi toners (the non-damaging manic panic virgin snow or a tiny drop of ultra violet mixed with conditioner: these I leave on overnight) but for after the initial bleach these toners take me where I need to go in 20 min. The mixture turns DARK violet on the head but don&#x27;t fear! Leave it in for at least 20. When you wash it out (I use purple shampoo) you are left with gorgeous snowy locks! I use 20 vol with this, although arguably they say you can use 10 since you&#x27;re just depositing; I say why not get a little extra lift if you can! These are the best toners around! I always have backups of my t18, usually t14 and my cooling violet has lasted me months!</li>
    <li> Nice item, hard to find locally so I was pleased to be able to get online for such a good price.</li>
    <li> I used this with a 20vol. developer on my super light bleached hair (left it for about 25minutes), and came out with some awesome steel-gray hair.  If I had left it on a little less, it would be silver, but I&#x27;m so happy with this toner; if you&#x27;re looking for silver hair, I totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> If you are trying to zap any yellow/orange in your hair, go silver/purple, or all of the above then this toner is for you. When I was taking my hair to white and was trying to get rid of some annoying spots of yellowish orange I used a cap full of this in a mixture of my other toners - T18 and T14 - and viola! Color achieved :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really know how to  use it when I got the bottle said add on to tone red down</li>
