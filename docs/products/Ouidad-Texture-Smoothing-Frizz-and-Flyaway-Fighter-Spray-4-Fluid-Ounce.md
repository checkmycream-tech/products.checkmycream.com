      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more so that I never run out.  </li>

      <li>After my hair is dry, I will mist this on to add even more shine.  </li>
      <li>...if you use too much product you might get &#x27;crunch&#x27; so experiment first on just how much you need.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it is because I have such fine hair</li>
      <li>Shine and control, and a very subtle, pleasant fragrance make for exactly the product I&#x27;ve been searching for!</li>
      <li>This works, but does put a bit too much shine for my taste.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for curly, wavy, frizzy hair!</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is no build-up, as this washes out very well.  </li>
      <li>I live in Florida and the summers are so hot and humid</li>
      <li>I have fairly fine, long curly hair.  </li>
      <li>and sometimes I mix it with a bit of Tress Effects styling gel for a little more hold in real humid weather.</li>
      <li>but the picture made it look normal size.</li>
      <li>I cannot believe how soft my hair feels!  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m 64, with thick, wild, wavy salt and pepper hair, and all of Ouidad&#x27;s products are terrific, but this one really delivers.  </li>
<li> It is not heavy and does not weigh down my hair.</li>

<li> My hair isn&#x27;t curly, but it does have a slight wave and is very dry.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, that product didn&#x27;t have much positive effect on my hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to add some shine and luster to my hair without weighing it down or having it look and feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The product came packaged tightly in plastic, so nothing leaked ,spilled or broke.</li>
<li> It also felt a little like having hairspray on.</li>
<li> I rely on the reviews since I am currently overseas and returns are difficult.</li>
<li> but the bottle is very small.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed with it.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <li> This works, but does put a bit too much shine for my taste.</li>
    <li> just enough shine, smells good and keeps fly aways in place.Great product now i must try other products from this line.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product is very very good</li>
    <li> Its a good product but leaves the hair feeling greasy. I do not notice a difference with or without it freezing-wise. I live in a very hot and humid city with curly hair that tends to feel freeze.</li>
    <li> Did not control my frizz</li>
    <li> I use this on the mornings that I *have* to use a hair dryer. I prefer to air dry but there are times when I have to turn on the heat. On those days, this works for those spots that either dry frizzy looking or seem straighter than other sections. It&#x27;s definitely not an every-day product but one I must have in my toolbox!</li>
    <li> The product came packaged tightly in plastic, so nothing leaked ,spilled or broke. I liked that  the package arrived much quicker then was suppose to, nice surprise. Ouidad climate control frizz  spray is a great product it really does work, makes hair shine and takes away frizz and flyaways. Recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Ouidad product line a couple years ago and I&#x27;ve never used anything else since.&lt;br /&gt;A good cut for curly hair really helps but even before I started getting Ouidad Certified cuts my old hairdresser asked me what I was using in my hair that made it lay so well and improved the texture.&lt;br /&gt;This product is best used with the Ouidad &amp;#34;Rake and Shake&amp;#34; method of hairstyling.  I do use a diffuser to dry it but you could rake and shake the product in and just let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;Try the Climate Control for frizz protection!  I live in Florida and the summers are so hot and humid but I don&#x27;t have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;Hint...if you use too much product you might get &#x27;crunch&#x27; so experiment first on just how much you need.  I have medium length hair and use about a quarter size amount and sometimes I mix it with a bit of Tress Effects styling gel for a little more hold in real humid weather.</li>
    <li> I have gray wavy hair. This helps control the frizz and delivers a lustrous shine. Highly recommend for curly, wavy, frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I have hair that is between curly and wavy. I get flyaways that gave me sort of a halo that I did not need. Just a light spurt of the stuff and all that is gone. I keep my curl and volume but get a sleek shine and control. It also has a very light smell that doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies. it is the only product I use regularly, and my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with it. I read most if not all the reviews and it sounded perfect. I have used it 4 times. Three times on dry hair and 1 time on wet. Maybe it is because I have such fine hair but it left my hair greasy looking each time. It is not heavy and does not weigh down my hair. It also felt a little like having hairspray on. Not too much hold but a little. I rely on the reviews since I am currently overseas and returns are difficult. I was being bold to try a new product within the line I like. I guess for now I will stick with what I know.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for frizzy flyaways or &amp;#34;hair halo&amp;#34; as I like to refer to it.  I can even get away with just this to style my hair on a non humid or winter day.</li>
    <li> LOVE the product itself and it was shipped super fast but the bottle is very small. I&#x27;m sure it said it was four ounces but the picture made it look normal size.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for curly hair, gives a nice shine and texture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64, with thick, wild, wavy salt and pepper hair, and all of Ouidad&#x27;s products are terrific, but this one really delivers.  Shine and control, and a very subtle, pleasant fragrance make for exactly the product I&#x27;ve been searching for!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair went gray, and turned curly, about five years ago. To a severe degree. Nothing has tamed my frizz, or given my curls such shine and definition, as this. I will use this for life. It smells amazing too. Like, to the point of people commenting. I&#x27;m pretty much smelling my own hair because I love it so much. A total convert.</li>
    <li> Rarely do I write reviews here on Amazon but just had to sing the praises of this product.  I have straight hair that has gotten more frizzy over the years and this spray has made my hair shiny and smooth!  I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this product is so wonderful, I had to share my opinion.  My hair isn&#x27;t curly, but it does have a slight wave and is very dry.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to add some shine and luster to my hair without weighing it down or having it look and feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray mist makes my hair soft and shiny without any greasy or oily feel.  I spray a few pumps directly on my hands, rub them together, and distribute the product directly onto my damp hair before styling.  After my hair is dry, I will mist this on to add even more shine.  I cannot believe how soft my hair feels!  I can run my fingers through it quite easily now....something I couldn&#x27;t do without tugging on knots etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no build-up, as this washes out very well.  I like that all the dry oils are protecting my hair and making it healthier after applying.  I&#x27;m ordering more so that I never run out.  I love this brand and also purchased the Ouidad Botanical Boost Moisture Infusing and Refreshing Spray, 8.5 Ounce.  Unfortunately, that product didn&#x27;t have much positive effect on my hair.  I might work better on someone with curls.  This product, however, is the absolute best on dry, course locks.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ll keep trying it because I paid for it but I&#x27;d rather use hairspray at this point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about three sprays of this and I already don&#x27;t like it.  I have fairly fine, long curly hair.  When I used this product on dry hair, the frizzies stayed where they were, only they, along with the rest of my hair, looked very greasy.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
