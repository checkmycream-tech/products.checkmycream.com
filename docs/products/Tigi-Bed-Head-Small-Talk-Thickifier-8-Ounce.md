<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product!  Other than the &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; smell, I reaaaaaaaaaaaly like it!</li>
    <li> Excelent product, and smells so nice and different</li>
    <li> I love this! So great. Smells great. Just put in damp hair. Blow dry. Def helps with thin or just people with finer to normal hair that just wants to add a little something!</li>
    <li> smells quite nice. Leaves hair shiny and manageable on dry or wet hair,with a very small amount.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Terrific price.  Flawlessly easy transaction.</li>
    <li> Did not work so well on my fine, thining hair.  Wish it had, but....  Tried using it all  over and just spot use.  Did not do it for me.</li>
    <li> Firstly, this product smells so good. It smells like grapes. I have thin hair and this makes my hair feel soft and full and it seems to also make it easier to style! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I am 44 with shoulder length, thin, straight, highlighted hair.  I love this product!  It makes my thin hair so much fuller!!  Even a friend of mine commented on how full my hair looked compared to usual.  It took me 5 months to go through my first bottle.  BUT my mom who is 72 tried it on her very short, straight, fine hair and she said it made her hair too soft.  So it may not work for everyone but it definitely makes a huge difference for me!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product! My hair looks amazing. I always thought I was stuck with thin flat hair and I&#x27;m NOT!!!!! Yay! My hair looks so thick my hairdresser was shocked. I had to tell her what I was using so she could use it on clients :~) I would recommend to friends and family. I apply after towel drying then blow dry mostly upside down. Keeps effect all day. I use 3-4 pumps, the pumps amount are little. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, wonderful product - where has this been my whole life?!!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> arrived with the contents of the bottle seeping out of it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff. It has transformed my morning hair routine. It&#x27;s great for getting a little pre-style in. It helps protect my hair from the blow-dryer and flat iron, and helps give my poor thin, fine hair a little more lift than it would naturally have.</li>
    <li> This smells awesome and really works. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> It came exploted dont recomend to but it</li>
    <li> I have no opinion about this product. I have very short (pixie cute) and very fine hair. This product does nothing. I have tried increasing the amount and there are negative results (i.e. my hair looks greasy). This product doesn&#x27;t add volume and the smell is literally disgusting. By far this is my least favorite Bed Head product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I got my first bottle in E. Greenbush NY.  I looked around were I live now (FL) couldn&#x27;t fine it even in beauty supply store.  I tried another type of setting gel, but did like how it worked.So I looked on internet found it and ordered it.</li>
    <li> My hair is always so much more manageable with this Bed Head thickener. My daughter loves it too! Thumbs Up!</li>
    <li> Great product. reduces frizz better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great thickening cream. I love how this gives my hair volume and a little &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; for styling purposes. My only dislike is that it&#x27;s kinda sticky and hard to get off your hands. you gotta use soap to completely wash it off.</li>
    <li> I naturally have thin limp hair and this product holds up very well against the humidity and hold volume all day!</li>
    <li> smells awesome....like candy :)</li>
    <li> Thank you.  The product was excellent; I felt I was provided good value for my money and will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> Works great. I hav fine limp hair and this makes it hold a set better and adds some volume. Don&#x27;t use too much tho or it will make your hair feel dirty.</li>
    <li> I bought this after having it recommended to me by my stylist. I have a lot of hair, but you&#x27;d never know it because it is fine, stick straight, and flat. I bought this product hoping to get a little thickness and/or volume for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works well. You can&#x27;t use a lot of it, especially in the summer, or else your hair gets greasy and heavy. But I&#x27;ve found that combing a small amount through my hair really does make it seem thicker and fuller. I would recommend this to anyone else who has really fine or thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have was the shipping. By the time I opened the package, a good amount of the product had spilled out into the plastic bag that it was in and had to be thrown away. I noticed that other reviewers have said the same thing. Next time I will spend the extra $5 and buy it from a salon.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years when my hair was short and spikey up to now when my hair is still short but no spike! It is great for styling without that real stiff hurt yourself stuffness. I used it to spike my hair when it was real short and it was a soft firm hold and now I just use it for styling great product I have told many friend about this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. When using with a blow dryer I have no need to use my flat iron.  It makes my hare feel amazing and keep the flyaways down. Defiantly my new go to hair product.</li>
    <li> Love all the bedhead line, smells sorta like grape but very good I apply to wet hair then blow dry style as usual</li>
    <li> did not like. have fine thin hair. could not figure out the correct amount to use, to much and hair heavy to little and hair acted like I didn&#x27;t nave anything in it.</li>
    <li> Love the price but they were all opened and spilling when delivered.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.  I have recommended it to so many people, I&#x27;m surprised that there are any left for me!</li>
    <li> Beware this product is very oily.  You can feel how oily it is when you rub it in your hands and mostly when you wash your hands after using it.  I have short fine hair and it didn&#x27;t thicken or add volume in ANYWAY.  It left my hair too soft, and hard to style.  Not in any way thicker or texturized. I tried it twice once using a very little amount and once with a little more.  Only thing I enjoy is the smell.  Was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Smells like fake grapes and it sort of puts me off form using it. Other than that its a great product.</li>
    <li> Threw it away.  Terrible texture and smell.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair &amp; this is a great product. It thickens the hair without weighing it down &amp; has a very nice fragrance to it, too.</li>
    <li> The product arrive promptly and the packaging was adequate to assure it pump wasn&#x27;t broken.  I&#x27;m not impressed with the product and I do not believe it lives up to the claims.  Also, I had to go back on-line to find out specifically  how to use and the product for the best results.  Judy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  The smell is the part I can&#x27;t get over.  It is strong and not a good smell.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, limp hair that is prone to looking greasy. I read about this stuff in a book by Abby Smith called &amp;#34;Twist Me Pretty&amp;#34; and wanted to try it. it smells really nice and is the consistency of  Elmer&#x27;s Glue. I squirt it in one hand and dab my fingers in it and run it through my damp hair before drying. I learned that if I did this without blow drying it, it left little crust streaks in my hair, but they easily brushed out after my hair dried.</li>
    <li> Everything with the product was good but the packaging left alot to  be desired. The container on one was open and the product came out all over, not a lot but enough. I suggest that each is wrapped in plastic so it wont come open.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this on my hair and it smells fantastic. I don&#x27;t know if the heat turned mine, but it smells curdled.</li>
    <li> This really works!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how thick it made my thin hair.  Also made it so soft and shiny!  I had no problem with the aroma (and I&#x27;m very sensitive).  My hair just smelled clean.  I was surprised how much I ended up liking it as I have tried so many different products.  This one I can definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, blond hair.  This is the BEST product to add thickness&lt;br /&gt;whether you set your hair in velcro rollers or blow it dry.  It makes my&lt;br /&gt;hair grap more when I use a round brush and blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the BEST prices for this product through Amazon compared to&lt;br /&gt;my local beauty supply stores.  They are several dollars higher than&lt;br /&gt;what I found through Amason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying this product.  I will NOT be without it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martie</li>
    <li> I love this product. Leaves my hair soft and manageable.  No frizz</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping on a great product I use everyday.  This is almost 50% less than I pay at the salon!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thinning hair. Tigi Bed Head thickifier is great. Helps my hair appear thicker with more body and now hold a hairstyle better. One word of caution, though: a little goes a long way. I use a little over 1 squirt for my almost shoulder length hair. Using too much product at one time is not a good thing. I will definitely keep this in supply.</li>
    <li> I read about this stuff online and it was said to be amazing. I was hesitant about buying this at first, since it was $15 down the drain if it turned out as junk. I am SO glad I bought it! I wash my hair every 4-6 days and use it when my hair is wet after I wash it. My hair is fine and wavy, but it is now thicker, healthier, and softer since first buying it a month ago. It also smells SO good, like grape yogurt. I would recommend this to anyone with any hair type. It is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  My hair was limp &amp; greasy feeling.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel thicker at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years.  I have strayed and tried other products but this is by FAR the best styling lotion you can buy.  I&#x27;ve paid 4 times this price for inferior products.  It gives your hair such manageability.  It makes your hair shiny, fuller and your hair will have bounce.  I have fine hair that tends to frizz or look dry or limp.  When I use this it always comes out beautiful.  Put this in your bag.  I have pretty long hair and this bottle lasts me about 10 months.</li>
    <li> It gives me great body for my thinning hair.  It is not heavy so my hair is not weighted down.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, I have lots of it but it is baby fine and lays flat on my heard.  This product is not heavy and sticky.  I use it along with a root booster and my hair actually feels thicker.  It seems as though it doesnt get oil as fast either.  The trick is not to use too much, please follow the &amp;#34;blah blah blah&amp;#34; directions and you will love it like I do!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!! It is perfect for my hair. My stylist used this before blow drying and styling my hair. To give an idea- I have medium thick, wavy and frizzy hair. Though my hair has good volume, because of frizz it never looks as if I have combed them. I use this on my wet hair (about 4-6 pumps for my whole head) and then I use dryer to dry my hair with comb. My hair looks great, looks alive and is extremely manageable.So far I have used it two time and I am really happy with this product. I will update once I have used it for 3 months, for build up and other issues if any :).</li>
    <li> I like this stuff - a lot. I&#x27;ve got both fullness and shine on my previously wispy, straight hair. Lots of body now. I put 3 squirts in my palm and moosh it through my wet hair and blow dry. It&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> I use this as a volumizer and my hair is not curly. I have used this product for years and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m brazilian woman and I have tasted and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;My purchase was well done and I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Bought this a few months ago for my thick curly hair &amp; haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference. It&#x27;s pretty much like every other product I bought just a cuter bottle. Yes, I&#x27;m one of those girls always on the look out for the products to tame my nest of wildness. Then there&#x27;s the little fact of my sensitive allergies. Smells get me down every time, even the Aragon oil causes headaches. One thing I have learned throughout the years is NEVER NEVER used a regular towel on curly hair!! You can buy hair wraps at Ross, Marshalls, or Target for pretty cheap. I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference from simply using these &#x27;special&#x27; hair wraps instead of a towel. However as great as the towels are nothing seems to fight the frizz. So I battle on....</li>
    <li> Love it :) The smell is a bit odd...I think its grape? I&#x27;m not sure...but I have had men tell me they like the smell and since I can&#x27;t really tell I feel like its fine. It does thicken very well and its worth the price for sure!</li>
    <li> This takes my hair from unmanageable and flyaway to being swingy and soft and silky. My hair tends to clump up over the course of the day, and this helps to prevent that. That&#x27;s what I mean by swingy. It adds thickness and body and helps to smooth it out a little, especially if blow drying. I have fine, thin hair, and this makes it look about as good as it can look without making it look greasy. I used it when my hair was longer (a bit more than shoulder length) and it was exactly what I needed to keep my hair looking good all day. Without this, my hair would look like I&#x27;d walked through a hurricane by the time I got into the grocery store or whatever, even if it wasn&#x27;t that windy.  I have my hair a little more than chin length now, and it keeps it a bit bouncy and, yes, still a bit swingy, which I like. I use this everyday before I blow dry my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It makes my short pixie cut stay in place and my hair feels thicker.  The bottle was full when I got it and didn&#x27;t leak with shipping.  I like the smell, grapes!  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> the quality is very good</li>
    <li> Product was great but packaging was bad, came in a big envelope, top had unscrewed and product had leaked out.</li>
    <li> Smells great but weighed my hair down.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and have never had a loyalty to any hair product before this one.  I have trouble growing out my hair as it would frizz at a certain length...and frizz control products left it limp and dull.  This product provides everything I need!  Smooth, shiny, behaving hair with body that is soft to the touch.  If Tigi ever stopped making this product I think I would cry.  It&#x27;s been hard to find in stores....but now that I know I can rely on Amazon I am one happy girl.</li>
    <li> It was not as well as I was hoping. It&#x27;s size and only holding 8 ounces is not enough to meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells even better (like grape candy).  You only need a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore Bed Head products as  I really haven&#x27;t had one that let me down but this product really amazed me. In addition to smelling amazing (like a sweet grapey yogurt!) I put it in after bowl drying my hair and it takes out any tangles and smooths out all my frizz in my wavy hair. Even better is the fact that you need to use hardly at all. Half a pump is more than enough for my almost shoulder-length hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff to death and would most definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Much less expensive than going to a retail salon.  I have thinning hair on top, this product gives me the bulk I require.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Small Talk Thicklifier off and on for over 10 years. Works best on short, layered hair. Adds texture and body without weighing down fine textured hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;Small Talk&amp;#34; for many years now.  Sometimes when another product comes along, like the Bed Head &amp;#34;Foxy Curls&amp;#34;, (I have loose curls) I&#x27;ll try it.  I tried the pump AND the hair spray.  I ended up with frizzy &amp;#34;helmet hair&amp;#34;!  Soooo...back to &amp;#34;Small Talk&amp;#34; and I am reminded, once again, why I like it...  It defines my curls, volumizes, helps hold whatever style I choose--sometimes I straighten my hair with brush and hair dryer.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Thanks it arrived in the promised time! Great product, awesome seller</li>
    <li> Ordered June 1st.  Delivered June 5th!</li>
    <li> It does help to make your hair fuller.  I put mousse in the palm of my hand and add some Tigi Bed Head on top of it and it does give my hair volume.</li>
    <li> Smells weird - plasticy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic  product for fine hair.  Smells like grape....  makes styling really easy.</li>
    <li> This is such a great hair product.  Mixed with the mousse it softens my curly hair but doesn&#x27;t frizz it out!</li>
    <li> I use this to create volume in my hair and it really works. The down side is that I have oily scalp so don&#x27;t use it near the scalp or it will be greasy in less amount of time than it usually does, but for the rest of the hair works wonders.</li>
    <li> I have fine short hair and find this product the best for me to give me body!  I have been using it for about 8 years and still love it!  I use a curling iron and the curl really stays in nice--no more floppy, flat hairdo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m alway trying new products to thicken my hair. I have alot of hair but it is super fine. This product seems to help, but I also put volumizing spray in my hair. Between the two products, it seems to help.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and this seems to give me a little more body.  (It doesn&#x27;t give me big 80s hair, but it does make it fluffier.)  I find that a full pump is too much for my hair, so I only use about 1/2 the recommended amount.  I also love the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> Best hair product-best price also</li>
    <li> SO TORN! I love the way the product works and feel it does add definite body/volume, but omg, the smell. I cannot tell you how much I detest the smell. It&#x27;s like if someone vomited grape bubblegum onto my hands &amp; into my hair.  But, I will continue to use because thank everything holy, the smell fades quickly, particularly when I follow it with Kenra silkening gloss. But gah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say, my daughters and husband both really like the smell, so.. YMMV.</li>
    <li> Love, makes hair appear much thicker!</li>
    <li> My hair is definitely thicker and it helps smooth it down too. The grape smell is alright too but my hairspray usually masks it anyway</li>
    <li> I little dab will do it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hairstylist suggested it to me and I went ahead and ordered on Amazon the day that she used it in my hair.  I have naturally curly hair and it&#x27;s a perfect scrunch to maintain my curls for many days!! Reasonsble price&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this product. it is best put on your hair when it is a bit dryer then wet. Perfect for blow drying</li>
    <li> So, I gave this product a five star review, but only because I ONLY like the product when my hair stylist uses it on me. Otherwise, I would have given it a two star review. Let me explain. When my hair stylist uses this product in my hair, it works wonders! My fine, lip hair has shine and a bit of volume to it which I love! However, when I use the product, it does nothing for my hair except make it even flatter and limper....not cute. I use the exact same amount as her and apply it the same way she does (she showed me how to use it correctly). She obviously knows some tricks I don&#x27;t because this product does absolutely nothing but make my hair look worse when I use it. If I could have her do my hair every single day with this product, I totally would, that&#x27;s how much I love it when she uses it. However, for everyday use for me with my not-so-sophisticated-hair-styling-product-applying-skills, it is horrible. I won&#x27;t be buying this product ever again. My hair looks much better without this in it.</li>
    <li> would not be able to do my hair with out it, makes the biggest difference in control of my hair style.</li>
    <li> I use the Thickifer when my hair is wet before I blow dry and it does lift the roots, but be careful to only use a drop and thoroughly work it through the hair or your hair will look heavy and greasy.</li>
    <li> I use this product to make curls and it is great. It also gives body without making the hair get too big.</li>
    <li> Great for straight hair that needs help with body. I purchased the pink Velcro rollers as well with duckbill clips and my hair looks great. I wash my hair, put this cream on it, let it air dry a bit, then blow dry the rest and put it in the large pink Velcro rollers, leave in for 10-20 min, take out the rollers (by rolling them back around my fingers so my hair doesn&#x27;t pull), and then my hair looks HOT for the day!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get the top to turn for the pump to work.</li>
    <li> Verry good !! I love used it!! And strongly  recommend  specially some one who used more virulent  hair must used it</li>
    <li> Not sure why I had such a different experience than most reviewers.....I SO wanted thick hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine and limp hair.  I have used it multiple times and tried it multiple ways and it ALWAYS makes my hair greasy and limp.....the exact opposite of what I expected from &amp;#34;thickifier&amp;#34;.  Once it was so bad I had to rewash me hair and style it again before I could go out.  It does smell pretty...that&#x27;s about the best I can say.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It makes my fine, limp hair bouncy and full.  It smells like candy but the smell fades away after I style my hair.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> I love it...my hair is really long and the ends are always stiff...i have been using rhis for like a week and now my ends are just as soft as the rest of my hair....</li>
    <li> shipment was fast and the price was good</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, so much better than mouse.  I use it every time I wash my hair at least every other day.  It is so economical. Ordered new bottle but am still using the first one.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Best hair product around. I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
    <li> Thickens hair but leaves something to be desired.  Its like the hair is really dirty after, sort of like a birds nest sort of feel.</li>
    <li> easy to use, control is natural, a little goes a ling way.  the bottle lasts me almost a year.  I recommend.  It is very difficult to find in shops and if you do the price is twice as much!</li>
    <li> WILL DO THE JOB---IT&#x27;S ok</li>
    <li> I have the thinnest finest blonde hair possible. I used to never be able to wear it down without ratting it and putting in tons of hairspray because it was so flat. Now I can wash my hair, put this in, blow dry and actually wear it down ALL DAY. I love it. I&#x27;ll never go back. I hope Small Talk is made the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing! I love what it does to my hair and the grape scent is awesome! It was exactly what I wanted and for a great price!</li>
    <li> I tried this after a stylist used it on my hair.  It is the only thing that I&#x27;ve found to tame my frizzy hair when it&#x27;s so humid.  It last forever as you use just a drop or two.  I ordered it as it&#x27;s easier than going to a salon and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s super thick and smells awesome :)  I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and different types of the same brand...  my sister is a beautician so I get to try all of her stuff too.  Between the two of us we probly try just about everything there is LOL  I&#x27;ll be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but my daughters complain about the smell. They complain about everything though, honestly. It&#x27;s a a great lotion for hair and creates curl. I wanted something for curl not necessarily thickening. I don&#x27;t think it is making their hair snarl either which is great. I like it but it&#x27;s hard to get it in their hair without a fuss. I&#x27;ll use it for me too, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time looking for creams to stimulate my hair curled. This is certainly the best to make curls naturally.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this and use regularly.  Works great in my hair to provide volume and help with styling.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is my go to product for my long naturally curly hair.  My only product after years of trying many, I&#x27;ve been hooked on this for at least 4 years.  Smooth defined curls.  If I use enough product, I can get another day out of my curls with a water spritzing.</li>
    <li> I like small talk. I use this with Thick to give my hair more volume. Has a great smell to it. I use it after shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this product on my hair when she blow dries it.It gives me great volume and control but,my hair is very greasy the next day.I would use it for special occasions when I need my hair style to last,but not every day.The price on Amazon is very good.</li>
    <li> I think this does its intended purpose.. brings some volume to fine/thinning hair. I wanted to like the scent more after reading it was &amp;#34;grape&amp;#34; but it has a little more of an unusual odor. Oh well. I think I&#x27;ll stick to sprays, but this is still a good product.</li>
    <li> This is worth the price. This makes a huge difference for fine hair; I use it every time after I wash, and before I blow dry. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using drugstore mousse for years, this stuff totally upped my hair game. I have thin, low density hair and this stuff makes it look full and it lasts all day, maybe two or three days if it&#x27;s a good blowout.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Left my hair oily. I have very fine hair, and this did nothing to improve the thickness. Not worth the $.</li>
    <li> This product is for thin or fine hair only.  I have a lot of hair but it is straight and fine so it always sits flat on my head. After I discovered this product, I ordered it on Amazon (much better price than the salon stores). You first shampoo, then after towel dry I put a dime size ( I have short hair) on my finger tips rub it together and rub it all all my hair. Be sure to get it down to the roots. Smells wonderful and once I blow out my hair, the results were amazing. My hair looked full. I really love Bed Head products. Before I blow out my hair &amp; after I use Small Talk, I do use Bed Head After Party Smoothing Cream. It protects your hair from drying out.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It works wonders in my hair.  Just a little helps me manage my natural curls and makes my hair look decent most of the time!</li>
    <li> Wrong product and it leaked all over I sent it back and won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff! It is amazing! I tried my friends and fell in love with it! My hair has recently become very thin and this helps to add volume and life to my thin/fine hair. A little goes a long way, if you use too much it will be unmanageable. I would defininately recommend this to a friend, again, because I already have!</li>
    <li> Works great! I baby fine/thin hair and this product gives me a fuller look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have medium thickness fine textured hair and it needs so much moisture and care, but all that tends to weigh it down and make it look limp and greasy. so I got this hoping it might give me some texture. I put 1/2 to 1 full pump throughout my hair after the shower, then loosly twist it on top of my head in to a bun. I let it dry naturally up there then let it down and it has this soft wavy beach texture. most beach sprays leave my hair feeling crunchy and dry it out so much I have to have my ends trimmed, but not this stuff. I love it! I wouldn&#x27;t run it across your scalp as a precaution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I have fine hair and it makes my hair feel much thicker.  I can definitely tell if I forget to put it on in the morning.  Makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this stuff by my hair stylist. I really like the way the product works and I use it along with Bed Head After Pary.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair which is very curly but tends to get frizzy within a day of washing it. I bought this on a whim and now I honestly cannot understand how I have been managing without it. I apply one pump of product throughout my slightly wet hair (not my roots) and then I just sleep on it. No blow drying or styling. When I wake up I have picture-perfect ringlets that last all day. It gives incredible volume and it smells amazing (also, the packaging is adorable). I don&#x27;t usually go a day without someone complimenting me on my curls.&lt;br /&gt;I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but I would still recommend giving this a try if you have long loose curls that tend to frizz or loose their volume.&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing in bulk.</li>
    <li> Love this, great price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product to add fullness and volume to my fine and sometimes limp hair. I use it before blow drying everyday and am consistently pleased with the results. It works great for both short and long hair with adjustments to the quantity used as necessary.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I have short, thick hair and it holds all day, sometimes two if I do not wash everyday.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on several of the glowing reviews, and because I needed something to style my now much shorter locks. On a whim I decided to hack several inches off my very fine, very thin mane in lieu of something more edgy and manageable. Think sassy, short short short bob. I think (generally) every woman has toyed with the idea of going short at least once in her life – while secretly praying not to look like an extra from Orange is the New Black or the lead in Rosemary’s Baby. I’d say try it, at least once. If you hate it, remember it’ll always grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I asked a few friends with shorter dos what they liked to use. One recommended the TIGI line. Initially, I was going to try Queen for a Day, but spotted Small Talk first – drawn in by the 3-1 aspect of providing volume, texture, and styling. I weighed the pros and cons listed in the reviews and gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Experience Thus Far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency – comes out of the 8oz pump in a white, semi-sticky gel-like potion. For me, one pump was plenty, though the first time I used it I went for two. Silly me, I’m still getting used to having less hair. Applied properly (see Use), this product did not render my tresses sticky or weighed down. Again, I typically have thin, fine, oily, flat, limp, lifeless hair. This did not promote oiliness, stickiness, or limpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dries rather fast. I showered, towel-dried, misted with a little leave in conditioner (if you are curious, it’s a 10 Lite Leave In), let it air dry a little (still moist), added some Small Talk, and finished off with a hairdryer. My hair was very very soft to the touch, was not dull or sticky, and had some nice movement and body. The morning after – slept on hair – still had volume and was not greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use – the lack of proper instruction on the container was a little frustrating. Specifically, I found videos that clarify you should NOT rub this into your entire scalp when styling. Instead you should use a pump or two, mix it along your finger-lengths on both hands, and comb it through towel-tried hair, focusing on the mid-shaft to ends. Then style. I think this product is best suited for those with thin, fine, shorter hair (shoulder length and up). I can’t speak for those with thick, curly, or uber-long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell – The older I get, the less concerned I am with a product having a heavy perfumed scent. I wish companies would take this into consideration, that heavy handed fragrance is a turn-off for most of us. While the product both physically resembles (bottle) and smells like grapes, if you dispense the product sparingly and evenly, in lieu of caking it on, the scent should dissipate. Otherwise, I agree with everyone who complained the scent was a bit much. It’s sweet. While I wish it had a cleaner, lighter scent, I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price vs. Amount – totally worth it, especially since I found it cheaper online than I did in store. Plus, one pump every time I style, the 8ozs will likely last me 2-3 months or more. I’d rather pay a little more for a quality product that lasts and fairly meets its claims, than pay less and it be worthless/useless/ garbage fodder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the provider – the item arrived as detailed on the site at the scheduled delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be eager to try other TIGI products based on this experience.ng.

    <li> I use it when my hair is still a little bit wet, it really helps to keep my hair curly. The down side is that sometimes it leaves white marks on my hair, just need to be careful</li>
    <li> Normally the product is meant to thickify. I&#x27;ve no need for that. My trouble is that since going grey, my hair often seems to lack bounce - even with a good hair cut. This stuff gives it bounce, especially after a sulfate-free shampoo. I recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product for short hair. It makes hair look thicker and has more volume. I love this product</li>
    <li> Finally - something that really does thicken the hair!  I&#x27;ve had curly hair all my life, but now that I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s, my bangs are getting really wispy and thin.  And I&#x27;ve always wanted straight bangs also.  Anyway, I wet my bangs and applied the Tigi Bed Head and just let my bangs air dry.  Wow!  My bangs were actually thick and straight!  It&#x27;s a miracle after trying so many other products that never worked.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product for good holding and body throughout the whole day.  Have used this product for 10 years. You will like it.</li>
    <li> Good value! A little goes a long way and it really works!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this product does the trick.  Doesn&#x27;t way it down, helps it to feel thicker and helps keep the curl.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Without this product my hair looks terrible! I&#x27;m very happy I can purchase this product online since I have no transportation to go to a store.</li>
    <li> Thanks for asking what I think!  My wife loves this stuff.  She says it works great.  The older I get the smarter I become.  If you keep the WIFE happy the whole world is a happy place.  Thanks again for a fine product and prompt shipping.  Even though both containers leaked inside the package....not much was lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy Fielding</li>
    <li> I no longer use a conditioner after I shampoo.  Somehow this adds silk along with volume.  I love the grape smell, too.  PS:  I have fine, stick straight hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this for me.  It&#x27;s good stuff!  I have fine hair and only use a pump or even half a pump each time.  It thickens up my hair wonderfully without weighing it down.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have extremely thin and fine hair, and I wanted a boost. The amount suggested to use never felt like enough, but too much and the intense smell was overwhelming. I might have been able to get past it, but I knew it&#x27;d just end up in my cabinet never being used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m familiar with this product, so I knew what I was buying, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find in the local stores. It gives my limp hair a little body and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product recommended by my stylist for over a week now (I have fine, thin hair) and just today someone told me that my hair looked flatter than usual.  Exactly what I DIDN&#x27;T want!  Am using sparingly as directed, but will not use any longer!</li>
    <li> Love the grape flavor! It smells so good!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist and I love it!  It has great hold but it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I have thin hair and I try to use products that help make my hair look fuller without weighing it down.  I would recommend this product to those that want hold without that heavy, gross weighed down feeling.</li>
    <li> This product does it all- prep, styling and smoothing. I&#x27;ve had many compliments since I started using it on my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before so knew it works well for styling hair.  It does add volume while leaving hair soft and easy to work with.  Takes some extra shampoo to wash it out (two shampoo/rinse cycles instead of my usual one), but it&#x27;s worth it to have manageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I was very disappointed to receive this product ALREADY OPENED (pump popped up) and ONLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS FULL (product in bottle is at same level as bottle I have been using for over 2 months).  Was I given a used bottle??  If so, YUCK!  If not, I don&#x27;t know who to blame - the merchant, the shipping, or even the manufacturer for not filling the bottle at the plant...?  Not worth returning, but will likely not take the chance of buying from this seller (Atlas Pros Choice) again.</li>
    <li> I love this item!!! It gives me body to my thin straight hair!I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products! Looking forward to trying their curling iron products!</li>
    <li> i CAN NOT GO 1 DAY WITHOUT IT.  THANK YOU I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND THE STORES AROUND HERE NO NOT CARRY IT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
    <li> This product has a ridiculous name, but if used very sparingly does what it claims. And it lasts forever. I worry about that because they might not continue to make it if they don&#x27;t sell enough. Oh, no. Catch 22!&lt;br /&gt;On the down-side, the round container makes it hard to travel with. Haven&#x27;t solved that yet. Airlines like things in original containers and this is bulky.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything.  It does smell good; grape but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.  I can&#x27;t even tell I have a product in and it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel any thicker</li>
    <li> My beautician recommended this and she was right. It does thicken the hair and hides the thin spots. Worth trying.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this product unfortunately does not create any body in my case, it just makes my hair feel dirty.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Too good.&lt;br /&gt;More like a receding hairline and will continue to use the idea.</li>
    <li> It really made my hair have more volume. !!! I am so impressed !! Just a little works. And I have think hair</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the texture of the product. I need to combine it with other hair products though, because I have curly big hair, so I just use a little bit of product to help me fight the frizz of my hair</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair.  I have tried so many products trying to build body and volume from L&#x27;Oreal to Pantene and on and on.  So, ordering this hair volumizer  was just another attempt to build up this fine hair.  To my happy surprise, it works.  And to add smiles to the already happy review, it does not leave my hair feeling icky, just feels like thicker hair.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience trying hair products (i&#x27;m old) and this is the first one that I will buy a second, third, forth time (and so on).</li>
    <li> love, love this product</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel thick like other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for fine hair.  It makes your hair look thicker and gives it a lot of body.</li>
    <li> A great product that makes my fine hair thicker and also helps keep the  static away during the cold winter months and helps hold the style during the hot,  humid summer months!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife, she loves it.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, this is a fine product. It performs as it should. However, the dispenser does not work on mine and I have to pour the liquid directly into my hand, while the product remaining on the dispenser drips into the sink. You would think that with most of the criticism of this product has to do with packaging, Bed Head would wake up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for only 2 days and I can already see and feel a difference in my hair. It gives my hair life and body which I really need considering I have thin and damaged hair. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product and should have heeded the warnings.  A small amount made my hair feel greasy and sticky and definitely NOT thicker.  I have a lot of fine textured hair and use Bed Head&#x27;s Mousse for extra curl.  That product works so well, I wanted to give this one a try.  I ended up throwing it out!!</li>
    <li> Although it give my hair a TINY bit of something in thickness, when I&#x27;m done drying my hair with this in it, it feels like dried out straw...Almost how it feels like when your hair is over-processed and damaged. I did not like that. It made me cringe. I have really fine hair and virtually no thickness to it. I did not have fantastic results like most people seem to have had with thickness, body, or overall texture.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. A small amount goes a long way and definitely adds volume.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair product because it&#x27;s not heavy in my hair and holds really well even when on my motorcycle!</li>
    <li> great product for thin or fine hair...only use about the size of 2 small peas and run it thru wet hair and then blow dry...great product</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Cant do my hair without it. Adds body and texture. Love!!</li>
    <li> This is goopy and does nothing whatsoever to thicken the hair.  I try to cocktail with other products just so I can use it up but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s really doing anything at all.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product from Tigi Superstar Blowdry Lotion. I have fine hair so this helps give a fuller look. I don&#x27;t use a full pump of product because then it&#x27;s too heavy and weighs my hair down at the root. I will likely switch back to Superstar Blowdry Lotion in the summer when I don&#x27;t have as much of a volume issue and because Small Talk is a heavier product.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty bad and it&#x27;s sticky.</li>
    <li> It really makes my hair look better and fuller. Great product!</li>
    <li> Its just what the wife wanted. A replacement. I do not have any thing else to say about this product.</li>
    <li> Seller sent the product very quickly. I love this product because it does make your hair feel thicker. I have mid length hair and I use about one pump and apply it when it my hair is wet and then dry it. I think if you use too much it will make your hair sticky. I have used it in dry hair before and it really thickened up my hair but I had to dilute it.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells, but it really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different I guess, but I got no thickening from this product. It also made my hair a bit dull, dry, and lack luster. I only use it now when my hair is dry to make it smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit suspicious of the reviews listed for this product. Many seem very short or blunt, making me wonder if they are fake reviews to boost this product. I am always suspect of reviews that simply say &amp;#34;great product,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;worked great,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;absolutely wonderful,&amp;#34; etc.</li>
    <li> I love this product, i use it when I want to blow dry my hair, It gives volume, shine, .... to my hair. And smell so good. Strongly Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Once again I purchased a product to give me fuller hair, and once again I was disappointed.  Made my fine hair heavy and did not provide much body at all.  I do like the Bed Head Shampoo and conditioners though.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a great look!  I have used this for the last month and it gives my style a new dimension.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair from being dry.  I put it in and comb it through when my hair&lt;br /&gt;is wet.  When I blow dry my hair.  My hair is moist and shiny,  never dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for approx. 20 years now.  I hope they will&lt;br /&gt;make it forever!</li>
    <li> Good product. Great delivery time. Arrived as promised. Love Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair that varies from rumply, to wavy, to downright curly. This stuff smells nice, is not too sticky, and gives nice volume when applied to wet hair and blow-dried. My hair feels clean after a whole day or two.</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly and in good shape from Amazon. However, this product did not work so well for my fine hair. After I used it a couple of times my hair became somewhat limp - almost like a build-up of product. But I am older and have fine hair so it may work better for someone with courser or thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Luv it.  It feels very \\&quot;slickery\\&quot; to the touch and also acts as a detangler, too.  What a lifesaver for my fine hair!  I bought this locally, but next time will order from Amazon, and save a few dollars.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a hairdresser and bought this for me.  She said it would make my hair look and feel thicker and style much better.  Having tried many products in the past that just make my hair feel heavy and dirty this did not.  I only used my round brush for the top of my hair and used my vent brush for the rest.  It looked so much thicker I was surprised.  I love this and will continue to use it.  My hair is thick but very fine and it really looked better using this.  It did not look like fine hair at all.  If you have hair like mine, you will love this.</li>
    <li> I like this product alot</li>
    <li> Use just a small amount. Creates more volume than mousse and not heavy like a gel. I use this every day. Every once in a while I try a new product and always comes back to this. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have an A-line bob that just reaches the shoulders, straight thick hair, color-treated.  I use just a a little pump of lotion and spread it through my wet hair then blow dry.  It leaves my hair smooth but feeling more voluminous and holds my blowdry style.  It controls flyaway hairs well.  I followed the advice noted above and stopped putting it in my roots and that helped a lot.  As for the smell, I don&#x27;t like that grape lollipop smell, but it goes away after blow drying.  The smell is the only reason I took off a star for the rating.  Otherwise, its great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome. It adds body and layers to your hair. I don&#x27;t have the thickest hair ever, but I am able to pull off hair styles that I have never been able to before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint: it smells gross. Personally, I hate the fake grape smell. I usually hate the chemical smell of a lot of hair products, but I trade that for the overpower fake grape scent. It gets muted a little by the hair spray that I use, but still. Tigi need to work on that.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it. My hair looks awful without hair product and a good blow dry. This is, by far, the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to style my hair. It smells fantastic too!</li>
    <li> Ordered despite all the reviews describing the scent. It seriously smells like kids detangler, very artificial grapey. Would not recommend if you do not enjoy that smell.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this product really does plump it up!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with usage recommendations for anyone who hasn&#x27;t used a product like this before. Defiantly made a good gift though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very slippery,easy to smooth into hair. It does give some sort of hold, but not any super noticeable volume. It kind of makes my hair feel weighed down with product. When I use it without blow drying, it leaves my hair &#x27;crunchy&#x27; looking. It does smell nice though, reminds me of a grape scent.</li>
    <li> This product works with my fine hair.  I use just a small amount and feel it is good but I have had another bed head product that worked better but can no longer find it.</li>
    <li> Everything from Bed Head is amazing and smells amazing. Super lightweight volumizer that doesn&#x27;t get greasy like most thickifiers. The bottle lasts a super long time. Only problem I had is when it arrived it had spilled all over the package and lost about half the product. Next time I&#x27;ll just go to my salon to buy it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair real sticky, but adds volume and thickness to it. Has a nice gentle odor as well. Great product use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and it is the only thing that will tame my blond hair.  So glad Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair and this did a great job of making my hair look full &amp; thick. I also only needed a small amount of product so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for curly hair. I use it for wet hair and dry using hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about this stuff.  I have really fine, straight hair with no life and this stuff just makes me feel like I have a new head of hair.</li>
    <li> This is my dream product.  I have very thin, fine hair that tangles every time I wash...but using conditioner to get tangles out just weighs it down.  This stuff is very slick, tangles comb out easily, and gives great thickness.  After 30 years of trying to find a good product, I finally have.  Prompt arrival.  5++++ stars!</li>
    <li> Wow. I love this product. It camouflages my thinning hair and holds my natural curls in place without being stiff and brittle. If my hair gets messed up, I simply moisten my hands and re-activate the styling cream. The small bottle goes a long way, as well. It&#x27;s the best styling cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I found this product originally with my stylist- it works really well in my hair ( thick &amp; straight) with straightener!!!!</li>
    <li> Bed Head is the best hair product out there. Seriously, if you want great hair - it&#x27;s all about the product!</li>
    <li> I love this product , make my hair look softer, easy manageable and look lighter color and texture and smell so good</li>
    <li> My favorite easy to use hair styling product. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do: stylizer and volumizer. Good non-sticky texture. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thin hair and when I use this product it makes it look like if have fuller hair than I actually do.  It also has a nice smell to it.</li>
    <li> I love small talk by bed head but then I received package but amazon the cap was loose on the bottle and some of the product had leaked out into the plastic bag</li>
    <li> Does give hair volume, but feels like &amp;#34;school glue&amp;#34; going into my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is shoulder length and pretty thin around the bottom. I was just about to do the unthinkable (for me) and cut my hair short.  I decided to give this product a try first and so glad I did - I&#x27;m keeping my length.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks and it has made a huge difference when styling my hair.  Please note I do use it in conjunction with Aveda&#x27;s Pure Abundance Style Prep for some extra umph and hold.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this permanently thickens your hair, but it does thicken the strands after each use.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it does have kind of a weird feel on my hair.  However, my hair LOOKS no different with or without it, except of course, for the thickness.  Don&#x27;t let the grape smell stop your purchase as it doesn&#x27;t last long.  Lastly, it does soften your hair so you may not need to condition as much.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but hopefully this will save someone else from having to cut their hair short if they don&#x27;t want to.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! I put it in my hair right after the shower and let it absorb while I do my makeup. When I go to blow dry my hair, it&#x27;s a little tough to round brush because the product makes my hair a little sticky but only while its wet. After I get done blow drying and styling you cannot feel the product in your hair! It makes my hair so big and thick and I need that because my hair is fairly fine! The only thing I do not like is the smell of this product but that will not keep me from buying it again!!!</li>
    <li> works for my untamed hair</li>
    <li> I have somewhat thin hair and this product definitely works well.  It is not sticky or greasy and does no clump my hair.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> my favorite!  easily washes out but gives some texture.</li>
    <li> Works great and I LIKE the scent!</li>
    <li> Works great without build-up.</li>
    <li> I have trouble finding styling products that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  My hair is fine, wavy,dry and thinning due to medication and age.  Boy, what an unexpected new challenge in life!  My hairdresser recommended a pump styling product instead of the foam mousses that I used for years.  The mousses not only dried out my hair, but they were hard to apply without going overboard.  So far, I&#x27;m happy with this product.  It&#x27;s easy to pump out just the right amount, a little dot really, for my short bobbed hairstyle, and I can easily apply it wherever I want without having a big ball of foam to spread around.  My hair is shiny and easy to style, not weighed down or greasy looking, which is a common problem with hair like mine.  I&#x27;m not sure that it looks thicker, hence the four stars not five, but I like the reults overall.  The fragrance is a little sweet, like grape KoolAde, but since it&#x27;s mild and fades quickly, I don&#x27;t mind it.  And, I&#x27;m dispensing the exact amount I need, so I&#x27;m not wasting it. This product was more expensive than I&#x27;m used to paying, but I&#x27;m expecting it to last a while. Amazon&#x27;s price was great.  And, a good haircut helps!</li>
    <li> I wanted so badly to like this, I really did. This does smell good and then, that&#x27;s where it stops. I have normal hair, I used this in hopes to make my hair appear thicker. I used a small amount, worked it into my wet hair and blow dried my hair. My hair felt like it had a gummy, sticky residue on it. As the day progressed my hair fell flat and was greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product does work to make hair thicker, I was not impressed with the end product. This bottle is pushed into the back of my bathroom cabinet.</li>
