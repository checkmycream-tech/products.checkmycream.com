      <li>wife needed the grip, without the bulk, these are perfect for what we need them for, you seniors know what I mean...</li>

      <li>Received item quick.</li>
      <li>I guess I got lucky cause</li>
      <li>they are quick to grab the hair.  </li>
      <li>These are amazing, not sharp where you can poke a hole into your skin or pinch yourself if you miss the hair.</li>
      <li>Only tweezers I&#x27;ve found that is completely effective.  </li>
      <li>but this is still catching the very short hairs.  </li>
      <li>No way were they worth $10.00 each.</li>
      <li>Even though I often paid more for other tweezers none compared to my favorite Lacross.</li>
      <li>While searching for them I would purchase other brands hoping to find a good replacement.</li>
      <li>The orange finger grip places fingers in just the right spot and</li>
      <li>They were right.  </li>
      <li>The new ones are not even close to the quality of the original ones I had.  </li>
      <li>After a year they&#x27;re still working just as well as the first day I tried them.  </li>
      <li>;)  </li>

      <li>and sure enough.. found it!!!</li>
      <li>Glad to have them back in service.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have to go through the trial and error as I did the first time.</li>
      <li>I bought the first pair by accident.</li>
      <li>I even bought $15 tweezers, thinking they would be better, big mistake!!  </li>
      <li>I bought them a while ago &amp; love them: they get/pull EVERY hair with such ease-</li>
      <li>I have had a LaCross tweezer for over 15 years and was excited to think I could buy a few more.  </li>
      <li>I have bought pretty much every set on the market.</li>
      <li>Pretty much painless tweezing.  </li>
      <li>It works and is good but definitely not great or anything special.</li>
      <li>Yet, it is strong enough to pull it and not lose the hair along the way!!!!</li>
      <li>I bought these based on the reviews -- who knew tweezers could generate such strong opinions?  </li>
      <li>The tip is thicker than the one I have and the thin tip is one of the things that made this tweezer so great.  </li>
      <li>They grip really well, and they don&#x27;t slip out of your fingers.</li>
      <li>The tweezers I received have no spring to them and you can very seldom pull out any hairs.  </li>
      <li>Better than any other for being able to catch and extract stubborn thick hairs or those elusive fine hairs.  </li>
      <li>I love these tweezers, they are the best at plucking out those tough little hairs in the brow!!!  </li>
      <li>These are so precise and when you&#x27;re trying to get just that one little hair that&#x27;s bugging you, you can get it on the first try!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to catch the hairs as soon as I see the black dot of the hairs growing in, but when my hairs reach a 1/10 of a mm, I know its coming out with this tweezer.</li>
      <li>They are better than some much more expensive ones I bought.</li>
      <li>so I was lucky enough to find it here.  </li>
      <li>Tweezers are really high quality.</li>
      <li>I would recommend them highly to you all.  </li>
      <li>I am here today to stock up on a few more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Tweezers are really high quality. Last long time and worth the higher price! For ladies that are old-school and tweeze, these are ideal.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different kind of tweezers, and this pair is  simply the best. I used to be able to pick them up at CVS or Rite Aid (I am a chronic loser of tweezers), but they stopped carrying them. I am so happy to see they are on Amazon. They may be inexpensive, but they will grab any hair, and yank that sucker out with ease!</li>
    <li> These are good tweezers - the ends fit together nicely to grip the hair.  Pretty much painless tweezing.  Easy to hold onto.  Probably the best pair I&#x27;ve owned to date.</li>
    <li> I bought the first pair by accident. Then I had to search for these, because I can no longer deal with the typical inefficient tweezers sold everwhere. Why can&#x27;t they make them all like this?</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the easiest to hold on to of any I&#x27;ve had. And they do a very good job, as do most LaCrosse, of getting those unwanted hairs out.</li>
    <li> Most others are either too blunt, too sharp, or weirdly angled so that you have to twist your wrist in contortions to get the root of the hair. This pair is perfect - The Goldilocks of tweezers. I only regret I didn&#x27;t check Amazon sooner and had to waste money on poor drugstore varieties first!</li>
    <li> Received item quick. Had lost mine and the store didn&#x27;t have it, even Ebay didn&#x27;t have it. I thought, Amazon! and sure enough.. found it!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these things!! I bought them a while ago &amp; love them: they get/pull EVERY hair with such ease- I LOVE THEM. I recently broke them &amp; have been looking for them everywhere. I even bought $15 tweezers, thinking they would be better, big mistake!!  I bought these at Walgreens- they no longer carry them, nor does Walmart or Target... so I decided to look them up on Amazon- BINGO! I bought 3 of them so I have some back ups--- yeah, they are THAT GOOD!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are everything I could want in a pair of tweezers and more. I am very glad that I bought them. Yaya.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because of the reviews.  I did not find these tweezers effective.  When closing the plastic finger placements stick together.  The tweezers do not grab the hair.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are the best. If you want the best tweezers ever made, these are the ones to buy. I go these almost a year ago and they are still just as good. Solid construction.</li>
    <li> I bought this tweezer because of all the great reviews but didn&#x27;t find it any better than past ones.  It works and is good but definitely not great or anything special.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are simply the best.  They always grip the hair the first time.  They are better than some much more expensive ones I bought.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned every kind of tweezer out there, &amp; there is nothing better than these.  It blows Tweezerman out of the water.  These will get even the tiniest, thinnest hair -- every time.  Unfortunately, they are a bit hard to find now.  I believe LaCross was bought-out &amp; these may be discontinued.  Snatch &#x27;em up while you can.</li>
    <li> The tweezers came quickly, with no issues. Had absolutely no problems with them. I would definitely reorder using this company</li>
    <li> These are the ultimate tweezers! Great buy with great customer service. The price point is great too! These are a great but, must have!</li>
    <li> I purchased these tweezers a year ago after reading all of the excellent reviews.  They were absolutely right!  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different tweezers over the years and would always get so frustrated with them.  These are so precise and when you&#x27;re trying to get just that one little hair that&#x27;s bugging you, you can get it on the first try! ;)  After a year they&#x27;re still working just as well as the first day I tried them.  I won&#x27;t use any others now.</li>
    <li> Only tweezers I&#x27;ve found that is completely effective.  Ends are slim enough to grasp just about everything you would need to use it for.</li>
    <li> I have had a LaCross tweezer for over 15 years and was excited to think I could buy a few more.  The tweezers I received have no spring to them and you can very seldom pull out any hairs.  The tips do not meet totally and as I mentioned there is no tension.  I was very disappointed.  I guess when Sally Hansen bought them out the quality went down.  I could tell a difference in the weight and feel of the melal also.  No way were they worth $10.00 each.</li>
    <li> Best Tweezers ever! Nothing more to add other than don&#x27;t consider buying any other tweezer. Buy two if you can.</li>
    <li> I bought this product many years ago. Unfortunately they wore out and no longer had a fine tip. I didn&#x27;t have to go through the trial and error as I did the first time. This purchase is the exact kind I had before. Glad to have them back in service.</li>
    <li> I have used La Cross tweezers for several years and purchased 4 of these.  The new ones are not even close to the quality of the original ones I had.  The tips do not meet and are not parallel.  These are now \\&quot;Sally Hansen\\&quot; brand and a poorly made low quality product.  Save your money and just buy a cheap brand.  (They don&#x27;t work either but you save 8 or 10 dollars.)</li>
    <li> Like some other reviewers, I have tried every tweezer there is - cheap and expensive - and this inexpensive tweezer is the bomb.  It is very easy to hold and control, the angle and the grip are great.  Better than any other for being able to catch and extract stubborn thick hairs or those elusive fine hairs.  I also can no longer find these at the local drugstore and have to buy them online.  I am here today to stock up on a few more.</li>
    <li> I find this La Cross brand with grip Tweezer to be very precise and I am able to work with&lt;br /&gt;very well with the slanted blade!  Great product that I have recommended to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 2 - one for back-up.  Thank you for having able for purchase</li>
    <li> These did not work of or me. They do not pull my brows out smoothly. They kind of hurt, actually and not satisfied. I prefer the black Revlon ones or the Tweezerman.</li>
    <li> I am a tweezer hoarder. I have bought pretty much every set on the market. These are the best. No question. The grip is amazing! I&#x27;m so sad they don&#x27;t make them anymore. : (</li>
    <li> I have been using these tweezers for over 6 years and they are the only tweezers I will ever use. First of all, these things last forever. I have used the same tweezer for maybe 2 or 3 years now. The tip does dull out, but I am still able to pull out very tiny hairs with no problem. I use these tweezers once or twice a month and they are fabulous. Also, very comfortable holding them. I have tried other tweezers and these are by far the best. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was not exactly like the one I already have.  The tip is thicker than the one I have and the thin tip is one of the things that made this tweezer so great.  It does still grip well though.  I&#x27;ll use it as a backup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying tweezers for years.Usually after a few uses they don&#x27;t work as good. I decided to look online and compare products. I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and it&#x27;s working better than any tweezers I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I may still invest in a more expensive tweezer later but this is still catching the very short hairs.  I haven&#x27;t been able to catch the hairs as soon as I see the black dot of the hairs growing in, but when my hairs reach a 1/10 of a mm, I know its coming out with this tweezer. This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> These re the only tweezers I use. They make my life 100 times easier. They grip really well, and they don&#x27;t slip out of your fingers.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the reviews -- who knew tweezers could generate such strong opinions?  They were right.  The wider sides makes this delicate operation more steady and the insides of the blades are slightly tacky so that splinters, etc. are more likely to stick and be removed on the first go.</li>
    <li> I have used these tweezers for 7 years now.  It was very hard to find them.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if these get discontinued.  I just bought 4 pairs...just in case.  These are amazing, not sharp where you can poke a hole into your skin or pinch yourself if you miss the hair. I swear by these tweezers!!!!  Marisela</li>
    <li> These tweezers are hard to find but are the greatest tweezers ever.  The orange finger grip places fingers in just the right spot and they are quick to grab the hair.  I love them.</li>
    <li> awesome and works great</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever had they work great. I also bought a pair for my sister because I know she will love them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> This product is a must for every woman who has endured those annoying hairs that spring up after menopause.  No more hairs on my chinny, chin chin!</li>
    <li> wife needed the grip, without the bulk, these are perfect for what we need them for, you seniors know what I mean...</li>
    <li> These tweezers work great.  I would recommend them highly to you all.  They are worth the cost for a good tool.</li>
    <li> These tweezers had been my favorite for years. I was very surprised and disappointed when I discovered they were no longer available where I shopped. While searching for them I would purchase other brands hoping to find a good replacement. Even though I often paid more for other tweezers none compared to my favorite Lacross. I was thrilled when I found them on Amazon. I ordered four pair. They are the best!</li>
    <li> The best small x-mas gift ever. My wife love these very much. I guess I got lucky cause there are a million tweezers out there and found these!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my sister.  She is so good at researching items and finding the best.  I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this item.  Great!</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers, they are the best at plucking out those tough little hairs in the brow!!!  I cannot find the in the stores anymore so I was lucky enough to find it here.  What I like most is how the very tip is so thin that you can go under a rebellious hair and pluck that sucker out!!!  Yet, it is strong enough to pull it and not lose the hair along the way!!!!</li>
