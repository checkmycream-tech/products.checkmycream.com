      <li>It&#x27;s nice to wear it just to wear it</li>
      <li>I used this in my hair for my wedding, I attached my veil to it and made it a very easy and inexpensive way to hold my hair and veil up for hours on end.</li>
      <li>it was very easy to use, and not too fancy to wear every day.</li>
      <li>Looks good for the price, doesn&#x27;t look cheap</li>
      <li>This was the perfect touch to complete my daughter&#x27;s wedding ensemble.</li>
      <li>but I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>it looks bigger and it ended up being the perfect size.</li>
      <li>it was a perfect accessory for my big day!</li>
      <li>and I was very pleased and surprised when it arrived since I assumed it wouldn&#x27;t look as nice as the picture.  </li>
      <li>The comb was simple yet elegant and was a great price.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s beautiful but the picture made it appear bigger.  </li>
      <li>I put in a bobby pin across the teeth of the comb and it held in just fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as pretty as decorative hair combs costing much, much more.</li>
      <li>This hair comb is super cute and elegant but it was way smaller than I thought.</li>
      <li>It is very pretty</li>
      <li>I put it in my hair to see how it would fit and having thinner straight hair</li>

      <li>It is exactly what I wanted to get for my upcoming wedding in June.</li>

      <li>The hair comb will do the job, its beautiful, its just the right size for just a little bling, this hair comb matches the earrings and bracelets that I bought  from the same seller for my wedding day</li>
      <li>They do give a nice little bag to keep it in though, I would use it instead of just setting it in a drawer to avoid damage.</li>
      <li>Perfectly fit into a French twist updo.</li>
      <li>but it looked very artifical.  </li>
      <li>so it really is very well made.</li>
      <li>Absolutely what I was looking for to wear with my wedding dress.</li>
      <li>Very study and substantial looking.  </li>
      <li>This product comes highly recommended.</li>
      <li>A nice thing about this, which you might not immediately notice in the picture is the comb is actually metal, not cheap wire or plastic</li>
      <li>This is very pretty and about 2 inches wide.</li>
      <li>Comb is thick and feels secure.</li>

<li> Hair comb looks very expensive.</li>

    <li> We bought this for a vow renewal ceremony. It is beautiful! Even better looking in person! You can&#x27;t beat the quality and look for the price. This product comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Used this piece above my veil for my wedding and it was perfect.  Very study and substantial looking.  About half the price of buying at the local mall kiosks too!</li>
    <li> I was hesistant when purchasing this comb but I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it would be, but one you put it in your hair it looks bigger and it ended up being the perfect size.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect touch to complete my daughter&#x27;s wedding ensemble. The comb was simple yet elegant and was a great price.  This item was simply beautiful!</li>
    <li> Looks good for the price, doesn&#x27;t look cheap</li>
    <li> This is very pretty and about 2 inches wide. It is exactly what I wanted to get for my upcoming wedding in June. I put it in my hair to see how it would fit and having thinner straight hair it wanted to fall through. I put in a bobby pin across the teeth of the comb and it held in just fine but when I took it out there were some pretty bad scratches on it. It&#x27;s not something anyone will see but I worry about the rest of the metal. They do give a nice little bag to keep it in though, I would use it instead of just setting it in a drawer to avoid damage. Otherwise its great and I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was slightly dissapointed by the size of the hairpiece. I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not looking at the demensions. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than the picture makes it seem. However, the piece is very beautiful and of good quality.</li>
    <li> Hair comb looks very expensive. It is heavy and well made. Wore it to a wedding and I got tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> Absolutely what I was looking for to wear with my wedding dress. Comb is thick and feels secure. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s beautiful but the picture made it appear bigger.  No size given and I have thick hair which will swallow this.  It was the gamble I took.  I would like to return but honestly with 2 weeks to my wedding I refuse to deal with that stress over $14.</li>
    <li> I used this in my hair for my wedding, I attached my veil to it and made it a very easy and inexpensive way to hold my hair and veil up for hours on end. this product looks exactly the same in person as it does on the computer, I have bought  other jewelry items where something looked shiny and beautiful but it was actually plastic and dull, but not this hair clip it was a perfect accessory for my big day!</li>
    <li> Bought this to wear for my wedding but it looked very artifical.  I ended up using floral clips from forever 21 instead.</li>
    <li> I wore this in my wedding and continue to wear it when I dress up for work sometimes. It is gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect hair accessory for me to wear in my hair at my son&#x27;s wedding this fall. The comb itself is well made and it&#x27;s 2 1/2&amp;#34; wide overall. It&#x27;s as pretty as decorative hair combs costing much, much more.</li>
    <li> The hair comb will do the job, its beautiful, its just the right size for just a little bling, this hair comb matches the earrings and bracelets that I bought  from the same seller for my wedding day</li>
    <li> Definitely made my hair sparkle on my wedding day.</li>
    <li> I used this to add some bling to my hair for my wedding. It looked beautiful, and held all day it was very easy to use, and not too fancy to wear every day.</li>
    <li> wife is a princess and she loved it!</li>
    <li> I was requested to fashion a wedding headpiece for my friend&#x27;s wedding and found this one and figured I would give it a shot.  The price was certainly right and I was very pleased and surprised when it arrived since I assumed it wouldn&#x27;t look as nice as the picture.  It is very pretty and it was just perfect!  A nice thing about this, which you might not immediately notice in the picture is the comb is actually metal, not cheap wire or plastic so it really is very well made.</li>
    <li> This hair comb is super cute and elegant but it was way smaller than I thought. It&#x27;s nice to wear it just to wear it but it&#x27;s not big enough to be a statement piece.</li>
    <li> I got this to wear to my son&#x27;s wedding.  Perfectly fit into a French twist updo. It was not too big,  just enough to add a little extra. Also once placed, it stayed beautifully.</li>
    <li> Beautiful combs for a formal occasion.  I can&#x27;t wait to wear them.</li>
