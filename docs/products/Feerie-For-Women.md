    <li> The bottle is beautiful, very pretty, on my vanity!  The scent is nice and light will be a good one for spring and summer.  Good addition to my perfume  collection.  I do have to admit I did buy it for the bottle, I was pretty confident that the scent was going to work on me after looking at what the top, middle and bottom notes were, and it did.</li>
    <li> never hear about this , but mi mother love this lotion, and now everybody ask about the smell i like</li>
    <li> I loved it!!! fast delivery!! good packaging!! and good price My husband loved it</li>
    <li> This was for my child&#x27;s bday and she loved it</li>
    <li> I bought this product from amazon. First when I received it was making some weird noise like if it had different parts, to my surprise, when I opened the packaging box, it was poorly enveloped in just paper, which is weird when sending fragile things like a perfume, My boyfriend and I are used to buy perfumes on Amazon.com and they have always been wrapped with bubbles to avoid any damage to the bottle, this wasn&#x27;t the case this time. Finally when I opened the perfume box, the cap of the bottle was floating around and the supposedly beautiful cap that is part of the charm of this perfume was broken in two pieces. It was supposed to be a nice gift, but now with the cap broken it just looks like any other perfume bottle and give the feeling of dissappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume smells nice, it seems to be the real deal, but it&#x27;s a bad experience to know that Amazon.com packaging and handling is of so poor quality when dealing with so obvious fragile merchandise like a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the grade is due to the packaging and handling.</li>
