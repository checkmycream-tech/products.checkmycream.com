      <li>It is a great hybrid between gel and pomade.  </li>
      <li>This product is great.</li>
      <li>good for spiking</li>
      <li>I do love the smell of the product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing stuff.  </li>
      <li>Not the best I have ever used, but very close</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, non-greasy, pleasant fragrance when applied, medium hold.</li>
      <li>It works great for fine hair,  giving it more body and nice texture.</li>
      <li>OK pricing - saw it cheaper elsewhere</li>
      <li>I love this stuff in my hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very good for short and medium hair.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily in the shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Reworking is easy if you apply a bit of water.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a hair product to give your fine hair some texture, this is it.  </li>
      <li>If you have baby fine hair - this is the product for you.</li>
      <li>It is fabulous .</li>
      <li>Works great to give texture to really short hair.</li>
      <li>this stuff is great for short hair, it will make it shine and stay where you put it....</li>
      <li>so it looks clean and not all over the place.</li>
      <li>Good for short to medium hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I really like it much better than the products I already had.</li>
      <li>Hair feels soft, women love that cuz they can run their finger tru your hair.</li>
      <li>The product was exactly what I had been buying and the seller sent the wax gel so quickly and it was well packaged.</li>
      <li>It is the right one&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect to use to get all of those fly-away hairs up into a pony, or to give hair definition when left down.</li>
      <li>but the item arrived in fine working order and the contents apparently did not suffer any effects of the outside temps which rose to 100.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It finishes very fast...</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>Wasn&amp;#34;t able to find it locally anymore.  </li>
      <li>haha!</li>
      <li>good quality, different quality comparing with regular gels.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much that meant to me that it be well packaged with the hot temps we have been experiencing and frankly thought I may end up getting a soup container of product...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t just open it and wipe it clean either because the wax is just going to come right out.</li>
      <li>The wax wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep my hair up</li>
      <li>To be fair, my hair is pretty long and it is difficult to get my hair to stand up, but I still do not think this product is ideal for those that like to have mohawks and such.</li>
      <li>Our hair is very curly.</li>
      <li>but I am not a fan of it because I don&#x27;t have control of how fast the product comes out.</li>
      <li>And the wax is pretty cool to look at because it reflects multiple colors.</li>
      <li>Works good on wet or dry hair.</li>
      <li>Highly rcommend it.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for the past 7 years and have absolutely fallen in love with this product.</li>
      <li>I dry my hair and then work some of the gel through my hair to give it some lift and this makes for much easier styling, giving me volume and shine!!</li>
      <li>On dry hair u get more volume, on wet hair you get a sleeker look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel that this product is good for everyday use, just to tame your hair, but it doesn&#x27;t texturize and hold that well.</li>
      <li>My hair gets a little frizzy and I just use the product t o smooth my hair down</li>
      <li>Pretty expensive, worth it.&lt;br</li>

<li> and she had to use a flat iron to get my hair in the front to stand up.</li>
<li> think it was sitting a long time&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
<li> I do like how long the smell lingers in your hair and the way it feels because it doesn&#x27;t harden your hair and you can still run your fingers through your hair.</li>
<li> I have been looking for something like this for a long while.  </li>
<li> It is getting harder &amp; harder to find, but it is the only thing I like to put in my hair.  </li>
<li> like the fact that the product behaves differently on wet hair vs dry hair.</li>
<li> but she uses it while her hair is wet.</li>
<li> I still am a little shy to buy it during such hot temps....</li>
<li> It will hold well beyond the life of any other item I know and was devastated when I heard that Matrix will not be selling this item any longer....</li>
<li> DID NOT USE PRODUCT UNTIL 4 WEEKS LATER - WHICH i HAVE DONE IN THE PAST WHEN PURCHASING IT ON SALE AT JCP SALON&lt;br</li>
<li> Works for wet and dry hair... but  just small bottle</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
<li> I use it to just mess up my hair</li>
<li> And the opening of the bottle gets sticky and a bit messy.</li>
<li> it was a little stale</li>
<li> I have to push very hard tog</li>
<li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> good quality, different quality comparing with regular gels. Pretty expensive, worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It finishes very fast...though.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this stuff anywhere else. It&#x27;s perfect to use to get all of those fly-away hairs up into a pony, or to give hair definition when left down. Nothing else works like this stuff- I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff in my hair.  It is getting harder &amp; harder to find, but it is the only thing I like to put in my hair.  If you have baby fine hair - this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Dependable product. Arrived on time. OK pricing - saw it cheaper elsewhere but they sold out so I lucked out when I found this product with this vendor.</li>
    <li> Not the best I have ever used, but very close</li>
    <li> My girl friend turned me on to this product and I really like it much better than the products I already had. I use it to just mess up my hair but she uses it while her hair is wet.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It is a great hybrid between gel and pomade.  Will give your hair hold without the stiffness.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a hair product to give your fine hair some texture, this is it.  I have been using this for 10 years and have never found another hair gel that compares.  I dry my hair and then work some of the gel through my hair to give it some lift and this makes for much easier styling, giving me volume and shine!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past 7 years and have absolutely fallen in love with this product. It will hold well beyond the life of any other item I know and was devastated when I heard that Matrix will not be selling this item any longer....so you can&#x27;t buy it in your local beauty parlor. Thank goodness I did some searching on Amazon and found it again and am so happy that I now can find it here! The product was exactly what I had been buying and the seller sent the wax gel so quickly and it was well packaged. I can&#x27;t tell you how much that meant to me that it be well packaged with the hot temps we have been experiencing and frankly thought I may end up getting a soup container of product...but the item arrived in fine working order and the contents apparently did not suffer any effects of the outside temps which rose to 100. I still am a little shy to buy it during such hot temps....but this seller did a GREAT job at getting it to me ...and all is well! A++ product/ A++ packaging/ A++ Arrival time well exceeded my expectations! Thank you !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product.  Wasn&amp;#34;t able to find it locally anymore.  It works great for fine hair,  giving it more body and nice texture.</li>
    <li> Hold:&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product for over a year. Keeps the hold all day and night. Easy to apply, non-greasy, pleasant fragrance when applied, medium hold. Good for short to medium hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styling:&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the product behaves differently on wet hair vs dry hair. On dry hair u get more volume, on wet hair you get a sleeker look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manageability:&lt;br /&gt;Reworking is easy if you apply a bit of water. Hair feels soft, women love that cuz they can run their finger tru your hair. Washes out easily in the shower.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses it on my and my husbands hair. Our hair is very curly. It is fabulous . Highly rcommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great to give texture to really short hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Works good on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> It is the right one&lt;br /&gt;But it was a little stale I have to push very hard tog get out the  jell&lt;br /&gt;I think it was sitting a long time&lt;br /&gt;Sorry about that!!&lt;br /&gt;Emasd</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Why are they discontinuing it?</li>
    <li> This is my one and only hair product.  I hope they never stop selling it.  It&#x27;s amazing stuff.  Gotta try it.</li>
    <li> I like how the packaging looks, but I am not fond with the way it dispenses the products, because as soon as I start to slide it open, the product comes rushing out. Yes, I am glad that it isn&#x27;t difficult to get to the product but I am not a fan of it because I don&#x27;t have control of how fast the product comes out. And the opening of the bottle gets sticky and a bit messy. I can&#x27;t just open it and wipe it clean either because the wax is just going to come right out. That is the only issue that I have with the packaging. I do love the smell of the product! And the wax is pretty cool to look at because it reflects multiple colors. I do like how long the smell lingers in your hair and the way it feels because it doesn&#x27;t harden your hair and you can still run your fingers through your hair. I wish the hold of the product was a bit stronger though (I have a pixie haircut btw). I had my hairdresser use this in my hair and I told her I wanted a mohawk. The wax wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep my hair up and she had to use a flat iron to get my hair in the front to stand up. After I left, 20 minutes later my hair started to droop. haha! To be fair, my hair is pretty long and it is difficult to get my hair to stand up, but I still do not think this product is ideal for those that like to have mohawks and such. I feel that this product is good for everyday use, just to tame your hair, but it doesn&#x27;t texturize and hold that well. My hair gets a little frizzy and I just use the product t o smooth my hair down so it looks clean and not all over the place.</li>
    <li> Thanks...was great to find what I wanted at a good price! I will buy here again when I need to.</li>
    <li> DID NOT USE PRODUCT UNTIL 4 WEEKS LATER - WHICH i HAVE DONE IN THE PAST WHEN PURCHASING IT ON SALE AT JCP SALON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS HAD TO THROUGH OUT</li>
    <li> this stuff is great for short hair, it will make it shine and stay where you put it....good for spiking</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s very good for short and medium hair. Works for wet and dry hair... but  just small bottle</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have been looking for something like this for a long while.  Will definitely buy more.</li>
