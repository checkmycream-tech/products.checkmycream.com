      <li>BETTER PLEASE!  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this face wash!</li>
      <li>I still use it, it seems to be one of the better products I&#x27;ve found!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>My sister had just discovered Pronexin and was thrilled with the results, so I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>Gentle on my skin, my skin feels great afterwards and it keeps the pimples away!  </li>
      <li>It feels nice and is a great exfoliator, and is a great all natural product.  </li>
      <li>This product is the best one that I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>My skin is clear and perfectly hydrated.</li>
      <li>I also tried proactive, which was 100 times better than this, (even though proactive is over priced as well for 2.5 peroxide).</li>
      <li>My skin is so healthy, and glowing.</li>
      <li>Most of my problems were on my chin, cheeks and temples.  </li>
      <li>I think it would work for many people.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product twice a day and more pimples comes out.</li>
      <li>Tried more products than I can remember; over the counter and online.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
      <li>We tried Proactiv and it was doing okay.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I have more acne than before.</li>
      <li>and I have been ACNE FREE!  </li>
      <li>Maybe this would be better for a boy or a girl who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
      <li>This stuff works in one step and is better than Acutane in my experience.</li>
      <li>The best way to start the day with a refreshing wash for your face that gets rid of blackheads and other pesky skin issues.</li>
      <li>Anyway, saw this at it&#x27;s website with the 100% moneyback guarantee, researched around the web some more and found very good reactions from people who have tried it and people who were commenting on the supposed scam saying it has 20+ natural ingredients at 33 cents a day, totally worth the try, and decided to go ahead and do just that.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the way it smells, but it smells clean and tangy</li>
      <li>My main worry was acne scars, and it did a great job getting rid of those quickly.</li>
      <li>I used to use L&#x27;oreal Acne Response Kit, and it worked great up until recently, which is ok</li>
      <li>Then I found PRONEXIN, the first week of using this product was amazing</li>
      <li>I bought this product after seeing generally great reviews, and wow were they right!</li>
      <li>In about the first two days your skin FEELS better, in a week it LOOKS better.  </li>
      <li>I had more mild acne</li>
      <li>Free about 4 days ago and acne is lessening already.  </li>
      <li>Liked the 1 step vs. 3 steps, but I really couldn&#x27;t see a difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all the achne products available and even took Acutane</li>
      <li>My skin has never been this smooth and even toned.</li>
      <li>It has a light scrub, and you don&#x27;t need any post treatment cream, toner, serum...NOTHING.</li>
      <li>For the price, pronexin is very very worth it.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a shot for the price!</li>
      <li>It made my skin feel refreshed and clean afterwards, but it did nothing to improve my acne, or skin tone.</li>
      <li>My sisters review, true story</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried most everything out there and nothing really worked.</li>
      <li>Read more reviews and found many people have the same problem with the Benzoyl Peroxide in the Proactiv.    </li>
      <li>I started seeing results quick,</li>
      <li>and I love that it is all natural!.....</li>
      <li>Try it, for about 32 bucks with shipping, this big bottle is double the size of Proactive (again it&#x27;s biggest bottle) and lasts a good 2-3 months if not more...actually more than that, I even lose track.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own battles with ingredients such a tea tree oil, and nourished with chamomile.   </li>
      <li>It has a gentle exfoliation that isn&#x27;t harsh and leaves my face feeling so good!</li>
      <li>Fortunantly, it doesn&#x27;t leak out when I use it unless I press right on the slice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying it online where I can find it, mostly here, and think it&#x27;s pretty much completely gone now.  </li>
      <li>It felt good to use, but it didn&#x27;t make my acne any better or any worse.  </li>
      <li>my face is not dry and flakey and looks better that it has ever looked.  </li>
      <li>Its very gentle on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, every single ingredient on the back is naturally derived.</li>
      <li>I have had a huge problem with adult acne for years.  </li>
      <li>first i wash my face with an antibiotic soap to remove all the dirt.  </li>
      <li>It does not work any better than simple soap and water.</li>
      <li>Save your money, any generic at a drug store works better.  </li>
      <li>Second, most acne products stop working over time because again, your face gets use to it.</li>
      <li>Previously, I used Murad products with good results, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I found them too drying.</li>
      <li>Everyone made positive comments about it.  </li>
      <li>I have very acne-prone skin and have tried pretty much everything.</li>
      <li>I even read certain articles mentioning the fact that skin could get use to Salicylic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
      <li>Pediatriction recommended Acne Free since it was same ingredients at Proactiv</li>
      <li>Maybe this is a &#x27;gets worse before it gets better&#x27; product, which is why I will give it a few more weeks to see any kind of improvement.  </li>
      <li>I decided that the best way to get your skin back to health and back to doing it&#x27;s job is to get rid of all the harsh chemicals that bacteria in the blemishes get use to.</li>
      <li>If you return the product, which I predict you will, be sure to read carefully and follow their return policy, or you will be stuck and they won&#x27;t return your money.  </li>
      <li>it dosn&#x27;t take much to work.</li>
      <li>I did not purchase it again, because it didn&#x27;t really work for helping my acne.</li>
      <li>I was very hopeful after reading the reviews about this.</li>
      <li>and I can tell it is really helping.</li>
      <li>My face still felt very oily after washing with it.</li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s because of too much stress.</li>
      <li>I really hope it keeps working.</li>
      <li>Now my daughter wants me to purchase a bottle for her.</li>
      <li>The texture is nice, not too harsh.  </li>
      <li>Love it because it&#x27;s so much quicker than other &#x27;systems&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I like it because my skin feels clean and soft, plus I just use it in the shower every morning and its natural.  </li>
      <li>The commercial gives you their trial price, but in stores the bigger set (which is the better value but on ml/price) is $60 and is suppose to be a 3 month supply...</li>
      <li>My son has mild to moderate acne -</li>
      <li>Pronexin is a natural product that really does what it says it can do.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always a salicylic wash then benzyl cream, and eventually I felt that I got MORE blemishes because my skin was so use to the harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it not only</li>
      <li>, I love the little walnut shell scrubbers, and the way it makes my face tingly and soft immediately after using.  </li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive to basically every product out there.</li>
      <li>But so far, I&#x27;m not too please about the fact that I now have acne!</li>
      <li>When I first try this product, it was working on my face and starting to see the resemblance.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 20 yr daughter that has tried everything that you can think of on her skin and by far this really worked, I&#x27;m actually ordering another bottle for her and my nephew now that also has acne skin.  </li>
      <li>I have never had clear skin.</li>
      <li>It did not help clear up any of my acne.  </li>
      <li>No my face did not miraculously clear up after 72 hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical at first.  I have tried numerous acne creams and the results are always the same...I still have acne.  My problem areas are my T-zone and my chin.  Even proactive wasn&#x27;t that successful.  However, Pronexin has dried and cleared my acne up.  I have been using it for about a month and I am seeing good results.  I hardly have any acne left, and what is there is the blackheads that are surfacing and then drying up and going away.  I like it because my skin feels clean and soft, plus I just use it in the shower every morning and its natural.  I will admit that it is a bit \\&quot;runny\\&quot;, but I think that its great!</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle.  I did like it as a face wash with the beads.  It felt good to use, but it didn&#x27;t make my acne any better or any worse.  I did not purchase it again, because it didn&#x27;t really work for helping my acne.</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful after reading the reviews about this. No my face did not miraculously clear up after 72 hours. I tried this product for over a month. I took the time to scrub the cleanser into my skin and my towel would still be orange from my makeup when I dried my face. Maybe this would be better for a boy or a girl who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup. There was also a film left on my face that I think was supposed to be a moisturizer, but I didn&#x27;t like it. I am once again looking for my miracle cure to acne. Any ideas?</li>
    <li> My sisters review, true story she went through hell before she found pronexin. I had more mild acne and it worked wonders as well. Watch her video and she will give you details&gt;&gt; [...]</li>
    <li> PRONEXIN, ACNEPRIL, ETC, I tried them all, don&#x27;t fall for it like I did after reading their bull.  Save your money, any generic at a drug store works better.  I also tried proactive, which was 100 times better than this, (even though proactive is over priced as well for 2.5 peroxide).</li>
    <li> i have have acne for 40 years. i&#x27;ve tried most everything out there and nothing really worked. then i came across some info on pronexin on the net and decided to try it. it is not the overnight cure it claims, BUT i have used it faithfully twice a day for a couple of months now, and my skin is smoother than it has ever been. i still have a few breakouts, but i spot treat them with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. this is my routine:  first i wash my face with an antibiotic soap to remove all the dirt.  second i scrub with \\&quot;pronexin\\&quot;  then i apply \\&quot;biodermagen\\&quot;  lastly i spot treat any zits. (salicylic acid and benzoyl don&#x27;t mix well so apply one...let it dry then apply the other)   sounds like a time consumer but it only takes me a few minutes and it has worked miracles for me. you have to be patient, and keep it up. and make sure you do this at least twice a day. my face is not dry and flakey and looks better that it has ever looked.  cgorder</li>
    <li> Pronexin is a natural product that really does what it says it can do.  The best way to start the day with a refreshing wash for your face that gets rid of blackheads and other pesky skin issues.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t a miracle wash, but I think I just have horrid skin.  It feels nice and is a great exfoliator, and is a great all natural product.  I think it would work for many people.  I still use it, it seems to be one of the better products I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> The texture is nice, not too harsh.  Its scent is not that pleasant.  I saw no difference in my skin with the use of this product.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My son has mild to moderate acne - We tried Proactiv and it was doing okay.  Pediatriction recommended Acne Free since it was same ingredients at Proactiv but actually a little stronger.  It worked well, but didn&#x27;t take it ALL away.  I thought I would buy the Pronexin to have him try it.  Liked the 1 step vs. 3 steps, but I really couldn&#x27;t see a difference.  He switched back to Acne Free about 4 days ago and acne is lessening already.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and we have 3/4 of a bottle left.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for years. Previously, I used Murad products with good results, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I found them too drying. My sister had just discovered Pronexin and was thrilled with the results, so I gave it a try. It is, without a doubt, the best acne treatment I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin is clear and perfectly hydrated. I would not use anything else!</li>
    <li> This product is the best one that I have tried so far. I had mild acne, I started breaking out on my junior year and started getting worst when I started working part time, I think it&#x27;s because of too much stress. That&#x27;s when i started to look for products, I have tried proactive and it only made things worst. It dryed out my skin and it irritated it. Then I tried biore its a good product but it was not doing the job. Then I tried simple, it was too simple I think it did not do anything for my skin. Then I found PRONEXIN, the first week of using this product was amazing I started seeing results quick, In about two weeks i did not have acne anymore but I still have scars, they are slowly going away though. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone whos tired of looking for products that actually works!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 20 yr daughter that has tried everything that you can think of on her skin and by far this really worked, I&#x27;m actually ordering another bottle for her and my nephew now that also has acne skin.  Give this product a chance and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne, but I do have a lot of deep blackheads on my nose that I&#x27;ve been trying for years to get rid of.  I&#x27;ve been using the product as directed for two weeks. My blackheads are still there, and worse, I&#x27;ve developed acne!!!  Maybe this is a &#x27;gets worse before it gets better&#x27; product, which is why I will give it a few more weeks to see any kind of improvement.  But so far, I&#x27;m not too please about the fact that I now have acne!</li>
    <li> It does not work any better than simple soap and water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30+ yr old woman who didn&#x27;t have any problems with acne until after my 2nd child was born. Most of my problems were on my chin, cheeks and temples.  1-2 weeks before that time of the month, they would start to appear and just as they were starting to fade away, it was time for a new batch to start!  Tried more products than I can remember; over the counter and online.  Proactiv seemed to work until it started causing the red, blotchy, dry patches all over my face!  I tried using it less often because I really wanted it to work but just didn&#x27;t seem to matter. Read more reviews and found many people have the same problem with the Benzoyl Peroxide in the Proactiv.    Tried the Pronexin and had GREAT results!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 9 months now and have had only a few pimples.  No more breakouts!  When I do get the occasional pimple, it&#x27;s much smaller than in the past and the pronexin dries it up w/in a day or two.  Love it because it&#x27;s so much quicker than other &#x27;systems&#x27;.  I just leave the bottle in the shower and wash my face with it when I&#x27;m in the shower.  Gentle on my skin, my skin feels great afterwards and it keeps the pimples away!  Not to mention you can&#x27;t beat the price for how long it lasts you!  Definitely worth a shot for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all the achne products available and even took Acutane but they all pale to Pronexin!! This stuff works in one step and is better than Acutane in my experience. I&#x27;m never using anything else!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for me.  Blackheads got worse and occasional zit breakout continued.  Also smells terrible and has a really low viscosity making it hard to apply.</li>
    <li> This product was too harsh for my skin.  It did not help clear up any of my acne.  I understand that sometimes when a person starts using a product the problem may get worse, but in my case it stayed worse.  I hope it works for someone else because it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Iffy. Its working for me, but not my daughter.  So, I dont know yet.  We have been using it for about 30 days.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing generally great reviews, and wow were they right! I have very acne-prone skin and have tried pretty much everything. Proactiv, facial masks, scrubs... Everything. Nothing has ever worked as well as pronexin. My main worry was acne scars, and it did a great job getting rid of those quickly. Some of the worse ones are still faintly visible, but i think my skin looks fantastic. For the price, pronexin is very very worth it. If your skin responds to it the same way mine did, you will be singing hallelujah!</li>
    <li> When I first try this product, it was working on my face and starting to see the resemblance. Weeks later, my ache has been coming around non-stop and getting worst. I&#x27;ve been using the product twice a day and more pimples comes out.</li>
    <li> I have had a huge problem with adult acne for years.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other treatments from Proactive to expensive dermetology solutions but absalutely nothing worked. FINALY, I came across Pronexin in my research for a remedy.  IT WORKS!  IT WORKS!  IT WORKS!  And it only took a couple of days before all my blemishes went away!  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6 months and I have been ACNE FREE!  I only have to wash my face with it twice a day (morning and night) and it dosn&#x27;t take much to work. Its very gentle on my skin.  No unpleasant smell and no need for stupid creams that dry out my skin to the point of burning the first layers completely off!  I can&#x27;t say enough about how well this product works and urge anyone who is fighting with this problem to try it.  Please, try this!  It is the solution those of us with acne have been praying for!  I SWEAR THIS STUFF WORKS! IT IS THE BEST!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this face wash! It has a gentle exfoliation that isn&#x27;t harsh and leaves my face feeling so good! I have acne prone skin and I can tell it is really helping. It smells wonderful and I love that it is all natural!.....will definitely buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.  My face only got worse.  If you return the product, which I predict you will, be sure to read carefully and follow their return policy, or you will be stuck and they won&#x27;t return your money.  If you want something that works, try \\&quot;sibu.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive to basically every product out there. I like that this is natural ingredients, and does everything in one step. I work out a lot and I think that may contribute to break outs, where I will still get one here and there even when using this. Ain&#x27;t a miracle, but does refresh your skin. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my son.  After a week&#x27;s time there was already a noticeable difference.  Everyone made positive comments about it.  Now my daughter wants me to purchase a bottle for her.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a 26 y/o female, and have had mild/moderate acne since my late teens.  My bad zone is on my chin and around the sides of my face by my ears and temples.  It seems to have gotten worse in the past couple years for some reason.  I used to use L&#x27;oreal Acne Response Kit, and it worked great up until recently, which is ok I guess considering it&#x27;s been off the store shelves for a couple years now.  I&#x27;ve been buying it online where I can find it, mostly here, and think it&#x27;s pretty much completely gone now.  Anyway, saw this at it&#x27;s website with the 100% moneyback guarantee, researched around the web some more and found very good reactions from people who have tried it and people who were commenting on the supposed scam saying it has 20+ natural ingredients at 33 cents a day, totally worth the try, and decided to go ahead and do just that.  Bought it on here because it was a little bit cheaper than off it&#x27;s website.  I am NOT satisfied with the way it was shipped I can say.  It was wrapped in a 1 layer thin plastic wrap, no box, with the little bubbles on the inside, and somehow during shipping got sliced open and there is actually a large slice on the side of my bottle, and some did leak out into the packaging also.  Fortunantly, it doesn&#x27;t leak out when I use it unless I press right on the slice.  SHIP YOUR PRODUCTS BETTER PLEASE!  I don&#x27;t love the way it smells, but it smells clean and tangy, I love the little walnut shell scrubbers, and the way it makes my face tingly and soft immediately after using.  So far my acne is literally drying up and the scabs are falling off.  The rest of my face is not dry at all, and it&#x27;s so simple with a 1 step producut.  It&#x27;s great!  I do still have some pink and painful acne left, but everday there is less and less.  So I remain hopeful.  I use it everyday 2 to 3 times a day, then apply my face lotion, and don&#x27;t plan on stopping until I have used the entire bottle and then I will make my decision.  I really hope it keeps working.I have tried everything and am sick to death of being 26 with teenager-type acne!  I am also on the pill, which doesn&#x27;t seem to help me either, and I will NOT get on Yaz or any other pill for moderate acne, that stuff always has health related side effects after women use it for a year or so!  No thanks.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 and a half months, for 3 times a day. It made my skin feel refreshed and clean afterwards, but it did nothing to improve my acne, or skin tone. In fact, I have more acne than before.</li>
    <li> I had a bad facial about a year ago, which caused my skin to have a bad reaction and just broke out everywhere on my face.  I started using Pronexin and felt the results after a few days.  I now get compliments on my skin!  My daughter just turned 13 and she will probably use it as well.</li>
    <li> I was really sick of my skin being constantly abused by acne products and regimens. It&#x27;s always a salicylic wash then benzyl cream, and eventually I felt that I got MORE blemishes because my skin was so use to the harsh chemicals. I even read certain articles mentioning the fact that skin could get use to Salicylic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide. I tried everything from the over the counter products ALL of them, to Dr. Murad, Derma Doctor, Proactive, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. My acne isn&#x27;t terrible, but I did tend to get a couple blemishes here and there and having been out of my teens and early twenties for a while I was beginning to wonder if I would ever get off the acne treatment train! When was my skin going to finally cooperate and work for itself?! I decided that the best way to get your skin back to health and back to doing it&#x27;s job is to get rid of all the harsh chemicals that bacteria in the blemishes get use to. Enter Pronexin.  I have been using Pronexin for over a year and I love it! My skin is so healthy, and glowing. Best of all, every single ingredient on the back is naturally derived. It has a light scrub, and you don&#x27;t need any post treatment cream, toner, serum...NOTHING. It allows your face, and your skin to get back to it&#x27;s natural balance in moisture while keeping any acne in check. My skin has never been this smooth and even toned. I have never had clear skin. By clear I mean no blemishes. With this I have actually achieved clear skin. Now, do I get the occasional pimple here and there...yes. But they are far and few between. I would say I might get one small pimple every other month, which could very well be from my hormonal changes, my diet, stress level etc. Also, I noticed that this rapidly clears my blemishes. In about the first two days your skin FEELS better, in a week it LOOKS better.  This is seriously like my miracle. I just pray they don&#x27;t discontinue this product.  If you are wavering on trying it, then let me say this. A lot of goodacne treatments that worked and then stopped like Proactive are ridiculously expensive. The commercial gives you their trial price, but in stores the bigger set (which is the better value but on ml/price) is $60 and is suppose to be a 3 month supply...it only lasts for a month. The minute quantity I would have to use to stretch it for three months would not even begin to heal my acne. Sixty dollars a month is a lot. Second, most acne products stop working over time because again, your face gets use to it. With this, it&#x27;s like you are helping your skin get stronger to fight it&#x27;s own battles with ingredients such a tea tree oil, and nourished with chamomile.   Try it, for about 32 bucks with shipping, this big bottle is double the size of Proactive (again it&#x27;s biggest bottle) and lasts a good 2-3 months if not more...actually more than that, I even lose track. Totally worth it not only because it&#x27;s affordable but because it works. You got nothing to lose.  Best of Luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 and did not start having breakouts and problem skin until about 2 years ago. I have tried everything short of going a doctor (my next step). I bought this product hoping I found my cure and it was a fail. My face still felt very oily after washing with it. I used it twice a day for about a month now and I have not seen any change in my skin. So I suggest you save your money and do not buy this product.</li>
