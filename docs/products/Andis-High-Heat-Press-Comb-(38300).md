<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smoothness of the iron could be better</li>
    <li> This comb heats up very fast &amp; works well. The only annoying thing is the poor placement of the on/off button. It&#x27;s placed right in the middle of the handle. This causes me to accidently turn it off while styling my hair. I have to keep checking that the power is still on so that it doesn&#x27;t lose heat. If they reposition the power button, this would be an excellent, 5 star product.</li>
    <li> The High Heat Pressing comb is fabulous it ables me to style my hair with ease and the adjustable heat control is wonderful!!</li>
    <li> okay for the price does not get hot enough, I use it on my daughter who has really think hair</li>
    <li> I was really suprised at how fast this combs heats up.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great product.would buy again</li>
    <li> This press comb is alright, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like it. After using this my hair looked as if I only blow dried it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!! I have a very weird texture of hair and extreme shrinkage....this hot comb got my hair practically bone straight! It got hot fast and the buttons weren&#x27;t as much of nuisance as I assumed they would be....would definitely buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> It heats up just fine without burning my hair (I need high heat too). It straightens it without any problems. I am in the process of growing my hair out, and I had to buy this because my flat iron isn&#x27;t good on short, natural hair. For African women who have natural hair that is shorter than 5 inches, and kinks up considerably- I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, due to a slight design flaw, it&#x27;s easy to turn it off accidentally. Just watch out for that, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical considering some reviews I had read. And when I opened the box and looked at the comb, I thought it was too wide toothed to get my hair straight enough. I am black and my hair is very thick and nappy after being washed a blow dried. I had my hair crinkled so I decided to take a strand of my hair and try the comb out. It straighten sooo well. Nice and hot too. I even tried it on my kitchen area. NO NAPS!! I love it!! The only con I have is that the off button is set where you can easily turn it off. But other than that, it&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> Mom said worked good but didnt get as hot as would like</li>
    <li> This works wonders... I don&#x27;t have a relaxer but this product got my hair super straight. I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of pressing oil either. Buy!!!</li>
    <li> Finally a pressing comb that can handle my coarse hair.It heats quickly. The built on stand is in the right place to prevent burns to counter tops,but has to be moved in and out of the way to press hair.A con in the design is the placement of the     temperture control and power buttons on the handle.Evertime I grasp the handle I accidently hit the off switch or change temp settings.The pro is the 20 range setting is not just on and off switch. This baby really gets hot so be extra careful not to burn skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this pressing comb.  The way it was made is a little odd because you can accidentally turn it off when picking it up.  However, the comb maintains its heat and I am able to press my hair in a very short amount of time.  The only drawback is that you have to be very careful with the amount of hair you try to press because hair can get tangled at the bottom of comb and be pulled out.</li>
    <li> The comb works great.  But the on/off button needs to be moved because it&#x27;s so easy to turn the comb off by mistake while using it.</li>
    <li> Only use hot combs on my hair a few times a year, because I usually wear natural braid twists.  Since I have very coarse, thick, nappy, shoulder length hair that requires high heat to press out, I did not believe this tool would do the job.  After applying a small amount of cream satin press to each hair section and placing it on setting 20, I finished my entire head of hair in 20 minutes.  Now, I can say good bye to my set of Kentucky Maid pressing combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend higher heat settings and a setting lock on the dial.</li>
    <li> From reading the previous reviews, I had to try it out for myself.  I love this hot comb, I have been natural for 1 year now and i miss my wash and sets.  But using this comb will be just fine for me.  It heats up very fast and you only need to comb a section of your hair once.  I recommend this product to anyone.  P.S. This comb gets the roots.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It does the job. Only thing I hate is the location of the on and off button as well as the temperature control. If you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;ll find that your constantly turning it off on the middle of trying to use it. Overall the price was worth it.</li>
    <li> I press my hair and got great results while useing Andis pressing comb it&#x27;s a great product. It made my hair shine and last long i like the pressing comb very much.</li>
    <li> Works great. My only complaint is while using it some of the gold paint was flaking off.</li>
    <li> Was nice until it stopped heating up...  Now it just blinks</li>
    <li> even though it&#x27;s hotter than revlon&#x27;s pressing comb this item still didn&#x27;t get my hair straight enough..i would suggest if you don&#x27;t have a relaxer you may need to still use the pressing comb from the stove and not electric/plug in&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Works ok. Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and buttons are in an awkward place. I keep having to turn it back on. You&#x27;re better off getting a real pressing comb and stove.</li>
    <li> This hot comb works very well.  It straightens my hair very well (although I only use it to get my roots straight, and flat iron the rest) and I don&#x27;t even have to use the highest heat setting. It&#x27;s a bit bigger than the average hot comb and the buttons are weirdly placed so that it&#x27;s easy to make a mistake and turn it off while in use. However, once you get over those minute issues, it does the job and does it well :).    I noticed that this was being shipped from Target, so I actually saved myself the [shipping] money and went to a local Target and got it myself. I&#x27;d rate this product for \\&quot;everyone\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love it. Gets hot very quickly. Easier to use compared to the traditional hot comb. But it is wwaayyy too easy to shut it off. The placement of the off button makes nearly impossible to avoid it unless you hold it awkwardly. Other than that, it does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> i did not like it. mabyy i wasnt doing it right but it cause more heat damage than a straightner and less results so ill stick to a straightner.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and travels well. The only problem is the controlls are in the way.</li>
    <li> On/off switch in the WORST place EVER!!! 😢😱. Every time I used it, it kept turning off..AaRrgh!!!  It gets hot, but not the best I&#x27;ve owned</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> I use this iron in combination with a flat iron to regularly straighten and smooth my natural texture hair. I am African American and because I don&#x27;t process my hair chemically, it seems to do okay with a little bit of heat without damaging it too much. This comb works well for my cropped, natural hair so I can wear it in a straight, smooth style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Andis 38300 for about a month and have used it 4 times, twice for an all over pressing and twice for just doing my edges.  This hotcomb works great and has a heft to it so it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap at all.  I love that the stand is attached, my last one wasn&#x27;t so I was always having to rememeber to grab the comb and the stand when pressing my hair.     The heat settings are fine though I don&#x27;t think I would dare use it on the highest level of 20.  And the comb does smoke when it gets hot so your hair will definitely smell like it has been pressed.    Overall, great product, much better than flat-ironing, and I&#x27;ll just have to see how long it holds up with regular use, hopefully as long as the GoldnHot that I had for 15 years.</li>
    <li> I love this hot comb. I use it to straighten my roots and it works wonders. It is a bit big and the controls are in an awkward spot, but you get used to it. It gets hot very fast, I set my to level 5 because the higher ones are too hot for my hair. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This comb is awesome. It works very well on thick hair and i use a lower heat setting.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Nit for my type of hair.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several electric hot combs in the past. The Andis 38300 High Heat Press Comb is a great hot comb. With previous hot combs that I&#x27;ve bought, I had to put the temp on the highest setting to get any kind of heat. And I found this odd and frustrating since hot combs are used primarily by African-American women and our hair is coarser and requires higher heat. So because of past experience, I immediately put the setting on 20 (highest setting)when I started using the Andis 38300. I soon found out there was no need to set it that high. The hot comb was super hot and I nearly burned my scalp. It did a great job of straightening and smoothing my edges (which is what I mainly use the hot comb for). I did need to use a little oil along with the hot comb to completely get rid of the frizz. The next time I used it, I had the setting on 5 and it did an excellent job of smoothing my hair without burning my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andis 38300 is definitely one of the better electric hot combs that I have used. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome press comb for the price. It gets very hot and works great to smooth out long, coarse and kinky hair. It leaves a nice smooth shine and doesn&#x27;t burn the hair. It slides through thick hair effortlessly and heats up in just a few seconds. So much easier to use than a flat iron and doesn&#x27;t leave any crimp marks like a flat iron does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tested this out once, but I can tell I&#x27;m going to love it once I get to using it more. It gets hot VERY fast. I had it on a medium setting and it was incredibly hot. I can only imagine what the high setting would do! It ~is~ relatively easy to burn yourself with this too, I lightly burnt my scalp a few times. A few weeks ago I got my hair cut a little shorter, basically an a-line bob looking haircut. This has made styling it SO much easier. Trying to use a straightener on the back is pretty much impossible since it&#x27;s layered and short back there. I may purchase another one as a gift I like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *did* notice a slightly weird smell after the first use. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the comb reacting with the product in my hair, or just the comb itself. It kind of smelt like it was coming from the comb (Not really a burnt smell, more like.. a factory smell?), but it&#x27;s not a huge problem and it didn&#x27;t effect my opinion of this product at all. I have VERY thick hair, even after I got it thinned out it is a pain to to try to straighten.</li>
    <li> I just \\&quot;happened\\&quot; upon this comb at Walmart.  I was actually looking for a flat iron, but saw this and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  This comb really does \\&quot;straightens\\&quot; my hair like back in the day.  I agree with the other reviews about the on-off button being in an awkward place and accidentally turning it off.  But other than that, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.  The Walmart price was $15.99 and that made for a sweet deal!!</li>
    <li> FIRST OFF LET ME START MY SAYING I DONT NORMALLY DO ONLINE SHOPPING. BEING IN COLLEGE IT IS HARD TO GET QUALITY ITEMS AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. AMAZON WAS GREAT ABOUT SHIPPING MY ORDER QUICKLY ABOUT A WEEK AND HALF. I BOUGHT THIS HOT COMB BECAUSE IT WAS ANDIS I AM FAMILAR WITH THEIR FLAT IRONS WHICH I LOVE! THE ACTUAL HOT COMB IT HEAVY NOT LIGHT AND CHEAP FEEING. I HAVE CURLY/ WAVY HAIR AFTER WASHING IT. THIS HOT COMB STRAIGHTNED OUT ANY WAVE I HAD IN MY ROOTS I HAVE NOT TRIED USING IT ON MY WHOLE HEAD BECAUSE MY HAIR WAS ALREADY STRAIGHTNED. IT DOES GET HOT AND THE PRICE IS WELL WORTH IT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO PEOLE WITH THICK AND CURLY HAIR BEING THAT I AM AFRICAN AMERICAN IT WORKS WONDERS ON MY HAIR .BECAUSE MY HAIR REQUIRES A NICE AMOUNT OF HEAT TO STRAIGHTEN. A DEFINATE MUST HAVE</li>
    <li> I received the product promptly, but when I opened the package it appeared as if a thin layer of hair grease was on the comb. It smudged under my finger.</li>
    <li> This pressing comb is not too bad....it gets pretty hot for an electric comb and straightens hair.  I use it daily and it gets the job done.  Like other reviews have stated, the on/off button could be better placed, but I work it out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a shortage but I do I can&#x27;t make it work but it works very well straightens my mom here as well as mine</li>
    <li> Does what it promises</li>
    <li> Wow, this product is amazing - absolutely love it to bits. My new hair friend:) ON &amp; OFF button tend to get in the way but otherwise heat is great for my thick afro.</li>
    <li> This works great I will buy it again.  Much better than what I was using before.  Easy to use and hard to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> This heat press comb is easy to use. I&#x27;m not experienced in pressing hair; however, it was simple. I&#x27;m in the process of transitioning out of relaxed to natural hair, and pressing my roots/new growth help prevent breakage. I put the pressing comb on 10 (the settings are 1-20) and it straightened my roots with one stroke. This pressing comb heats up so fast and it has an indicator when it reaches the temperature setting. I recommend this product to everyone that is in market for a pressing comb.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric comb to take on vacation.  I experienced great results after the first use.  It heated quickly and maintained its temperature.  The placement of the temperature dial and on/off switch posed some problems.  I have a curling iron with the controls in a \\&quot;box\\&quot; on the cord.  It would be extremely helpful if the electric comb could be designed in a similar fashion.  Other than that, I like the product.</li>
    <li> Does a fair job of straightening, but needs to be a little hotter.  Very good for detangling and partially straightening hair for follow-up with flat iron.  The flat iron is then more effective. The controls are a bit awkwardly placed, especially for left-handed use.  Worth the price, but not a stand-out bargain.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this item after reading all of the good reviews, they all are true, this pressing comb is the bomb! I&#x27;m an African American and I use a pressing comb to keep my hair straight inbetween relaxers,i only perm my hair about 5 times a year. Previously I would use a stove top pressing comb but decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; and switch to electric. I had problems getting my roots straight with electric flat irons, i purchased the Belson hot and gold electric pressing comb and was devastated that it wouldn&#x27;t straighten my hair at the roots, i bought it from the hair store for about $30 and it was a waste of time and money. I decided to take a last chance of luck and get the Andis high heat pressing comb and boy did i come out a winner. This little baby is packing alot of power, it does the trick on making my hair smooth and silky,so silky that it blows in the wind,even between relaxers. If anybody out there remebers the word \\&quot;hard press\\&quot; then please know this baby can do it, it catches those edges too. Also,i just went up to Target and purchased it for $19.99, saved the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> I really love this styling comb. My hair reacts well with heat. Years ago I used the straightening combs that were heated up on the stove. With a busy schedule it just isn&#x27;t possible to do now. This plug-in straightening comb placed at the number 10 temperature is great. It doesn&#x27;t burn my ends, and I have fine hair.  I can straighten it to really straight to semi straight.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb because I am growing out my perm however still wanted to wear my half wigs.  On the higher setting, the comb works very well for thick natural hair.  Well worth the price I got it for.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows that a hot comb flattens mostly by using the back, flat part of the comb which worked fine. I have natural hair and the bad parts about using this electric hot comb versus one from the stove is the amount time it takes to heat back up to an efficient temperature and it is really easy to turn off, which will extend the time of flattening you hair, especially if you do not notice that it&#x27;s off. You may spend hours using this hot comb and still not get the results that you want.</li>
    <li> I bought this pressing comb, for when I travel. It does the job. It is very easy to accidentally turn it off, when doing your hair. But I like that I can throw it in my travel bag and go.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron over the weekend at Target and I am taking it back today.  It would not straighten my hair at the highest setting, which was 400 degrees.  A couple of times I did notice that it had cut off.  Evidentally I hit the off button, which it is very hard not to.  My hair was a little straighter than before, but not much. I have thick natural hair, but I have never had a problem straightening my hair before.</li>
    <li> I have VERY difficult hair to straighten but the comb did a better job than the flat irons!  While it didn&#x27;t do much for straightening, it did give my hair a nice glossy shine.  As the other reviewers say, it get VERY hot (burned myself!)and it is hard to keep it on.  It does however, warm up VERY fast.</li>
    <li> See the photo yourself, works like magic</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughters hair and mines. Perfect for natural hair. Straights hair to a silky smooth texture. Heats really nicely like the old school hot combs that your grandmother use to place on the stove or hot plate. Would buy a smaller comb in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair that I relax and wanted a hot comb to use in between touch ups. I realized that this iron is good to straighten the rest of the hair but not near the root as I wanted it. Every time I got close I burned the heck out of me. So to use it kind of like a flat iron is great but not for a touch up. In its defense that was the first time me using a hot comb and maybe dont have the technique down. Also i didnt lose any hair as someone I believed mentioned. This iron is REALLY hot like it says it is.</li>
    <li> The hot comb works as expected,however the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button is very sensitive so I kept turning it off after combing each part of my hair without noticing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the look-out for many years for an electric pressing comb that would have a heat setting that would in fact do the job.  Finally, the Andis does what it says.  It quickly straightens with one pass.  I love the wide teeth and the thick barrel which has a non-slip finish.  After my first use, I bought one for my mother and I&#x27;m now buying a third one for my daughter.  I would rate this product 5 stars if it were not for the problem with the on and off button.  It&#x27;s very easy to accidentally turn off the comb, but after some use, you&#x27;ll figure out a way to avoid the off button.  If you&#x27;ve been making do with a flat iron, get the Andis.  I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
    <li> Luv it!! I will buy again :)</li>
    <li> I would of rated 5 stars, but I kept touching the on/off buttons and the dial button for the temp of the comb, so if Andis redesign this comb where that doesn&#x27;t happen, it&#x27;ll receive a 5 star rating from me and I&#x27;m sure other users as well if they&#x27;re experience the same issue....</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T WORK!! This was the worst way I have EVER spent my money I have thick curly hairy that is somewhat frizzy and it DOESN&#x27;T work. I tried big sections I tried little sections, I tried everything</li>
    <li> This is my first Electric Pressing Comb.  I didn&#x27;t want to fool with the traditional ones.  I used it durring my transition as my natural 4b was trying to kill the relaxed 4b hair.  I used this combined with KeraCare pressing cream and the results were beyond what I expected.  It do what it do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However....I did read the reviews on this product before I purchased it and it was mentioned that the On/Off button is a pain.  They were all right.  You will end up turning the unit off accidently.  With some practice this can be avoided.  It litterally takes a minute to get to the desired heating level.  I&#x27;m please with it.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
    <li> When it arrived I was surprised that it was bigger than I thought! But it does its job great, heats up real quick. I use it about every 2-3 days and for the price it&#x27;s a really great purchase!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I needed this comb to knock out a few loose coils (if that makes sense, since I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my pattern before I press...because it is not as defined or clumps tightly). The ceramic quality of the comb ensures gloss and shine to your texlax or natural hair. Heat up is quick, grip handle is sturdy, and temperature heat setting is safe for breaking the cortex of your hair&#x27;s every bend. Thank God for this item, I don&#x27;t like to use the traditional stove with the brass comb type of straightening irons(this is just my preference)! The price was right and I HOPE THAT ANDIS CONTINUES TO MARKET THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews unless an item is awful,or great. This hot comb is great.I&#x27;m a black woman with never permed hair,now my hair is short (think Nia long) so its important that I&#x27;m able to get it straight and laid down. This comb does the job.I&#x27;ve had other plug in combs but they were&#x27;nt able to get hot enough for my hair,but this is perfect.A friend of mine once told me \\&quot;girl you know plug in combs aren&#x27;t for black women\\&quot;; I can not wait to tell her all about this.I didn&#x27;t order from here tho,I picked it up at target.</li>
    <li> I just stopped wearing braids and decided to wear my hair out. my hair is all natural and has never had chemicals in it. I have been using various hair dryers, followed by various hot combs but this would soften my hair. I would then flat iron my hair and be done. But this would never fully straighten my hair. this hot comb did what the flat iron does. so now i dont have to flat iron afterwards. though it did not fully straighten my hair, it makes my hair shiny soft glossy and more straighter than a flat iron. The button placement is the reason for the 4 stars. it isnt really a big deal because i adjusted by the second section of hair. It gets really hot. I burned my scalp which im now feeling haha. I have really kinky 4b/c hair that really curls when washed. like you cant see the curls and my hair really gets 10x shorter if my hair info matters. I recommend this hot comb. maybe if i use pressing oil, i may get a better result. this was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my sister and she liked it very good product</li>
    <li> This item heats up fast and works great!  The only thing that I do not like is that it&#x27;s a bit heavy and bulky.  If it was thinner, it would be an even better product!</li>
    <li> For the price this product is great. It works well has a stand to protect the hot head from touching surfaces has dial to regulate heat temperature and easy to use. This is my first time using one of these combs and i like it. Will definately recommend.</li>
    <li> I received my Andis 38300 High Heat Press Comb recently. This comb is OUTSTANDING! I don&#x27;t know how I made it without it.  It heats up so fast. I have very thick coarse hair. When I use the comb to press my hair, it is so silky and last so much   longer.(I no longer relax my hair). This comb is a must if you have coarse hair. Thank you Andis and Amazon.Com.</li>
    <li> This comb works really well. Better than expected.</li>
    <li> My wife had been using her mother&#x27;s old heat comb which she heated on the stove.  She was having a problem with it occasionally burning her neck.  I bought her this comb and it has made her very happy.  She can control the heat precisely.</li>
    <li> great product, I am black affro-kinky hair, all natural great iron, work better that the chics for me with woth $$$$ very pleased</li>
    <li> This is coming from someone who is very inexperienced with heat styling (irons, combs, etc.).  It heats up fast and the heat is even.  It only took a few seconds to get each section of my hair straight.  It provided great shine and my hair had good body/motion.    I don&#x27;t straighten my hair a lot, but this is a great product.  I like it much better than a flat iron because I am able to get really close to my roots. If you are on the fence about this comb...let me help you out...GET IT!!!</li>
    <li> First the good - It gets very hot, very fast. It isn&#x27;t too bulky or heavy even though it is rather large. It&#x27;s cheap - about 15 bucks. Cord swivels so it won&#x27;t get tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad - The teeth are too far apart from each other so even when you comb through thick sections of hair, it does not straighten kinky/curly African American hair very well at all. We had to go over the entire head again with a regular flat iron. This hot comb was basically only good for giving a preliminary somewhat straight look. There was no way to acheive the desired end result though and it by no means compares to old school hot combs being heated on the stove. It was totally impossible to get a sleek straight look with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you must hold it very precisely or else you are constantly turning it off by accident.</li>
    <li> I like that this \\&quot;Andis High Heat Press Comb\\&quot; gives great heat and does the job i want it to but with annoying effort. The control buttons are smack-dab in the middle of the grip of the handle. It&#x27;s so annoying when my fingers want to grip the handle and constantly turns off the power while controlling the comb on my hair. I cannot see when my slim fingers have accidentally pressed the power control, so that while I&#x27;m pressing my hair the comb gets cold. And only when it gets so cool I realize the power button was pressed. I think the power button should go way atop the handle or below it, NOT IN THE MIDDLE WHERE THE NATURAL HOLD/GRIP OF THE HANDLE GOES.</li>
    <li> It works okay for me and I have super thick, curly hair. However, the comb does not get as hot as some were describing. Wish the on/off buttons were not placed where they can be triggered simply from gripping the comb while straightening, and wish the temperature could go a little bit higher. Would buy an upgraded version of this product.</li>
    <li> the product exceeds my expectations. worth every penny paid.&lt;br /&gt;promised delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Good presentation and excellent performance.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone who wants to straighten their hair temporarily without burning.</li>
    <li> I bought this hot comb for same reason any other AA girl would buy it: to control my roots and my edges. I can say that this comb does the job very well, especially for a plug-in device. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about purchasing, but after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m VERY GLAD I did because it has helped in ways a flat iron never could. The only set back, which has been mentioned numerous times, is the placement of the on and off switches which can be annoying at first, but I&#x27;ve learned to keep my hands away from that area as much as possible. Another thing, while this comb gets VERY hot, I sometimes feel like it doesn&#x27;t stay hot, or the hotness comes and goes, but I haven&#x27;t had too many hair issues when that happens so I&#x27;ve learned to deal with it. Overall, I definitely love this product and when it goes out, I plan to buy the same one :)</li>
    <li> I bought this while on deployment (the Navy) and needed somethin that would get be through until I could get to a professional. it works really well. it heats up quickly and gets nice and hot. The only con is that the it easy to hit the off button while using it so you have to be mindfull.</li>
    <li> I just finished using my Andis for the first time.  I love this comb!  Like the majority of the reviews I read I&#x27;m transitioning from using a relaxer (after 20+ years).  I set the Andis on Level 10 heat, and it worked just fine.  The on/off buttons are awkwardly placed, but I was able to tell everytime I accidentally pressed it so I never lost any heat.  I just turned it right back on.  The BEST thing about this comb is MY HAIR DIDN&#x27;T SMELL after I used it.  I don&#x27;t know what is is about flat irons, but no matter what everytime I use one my hair smells awful afterwards.  This comb deserves 5 stars for that alone.  I didn&#x27;t buy mine through Amazon.  I got it at Wal-Mart for $20.  Hopefully, they&#x27;ll heed all the complaints about the button placement and fix it. I&#x27;ll definately buy the upgraded model if they do.</li>
    <li> I think the teeth are too wide to get a good press. It does the job, but not as well as the stove one.</li>
    <li> works....my 2&amp;#34; nappy hair was transform into a light easy to manage 4&amp;#34; blowing in the wind. would have given a 5 star but the on and off buttons is a star stealer .</li>
    <li> The way I can move around with the hot comb is great, but it didn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair.</li>
    <li> because this item arrived at my house three days before than I was expecting.  This item fullfilled all my desires and I am very happy to be an Amazon customer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;d like to know if you can deliver to Brasil gold jewelry such as ear rings, fingers rings, masculine and feminine watches and necklaces.  If it is possible, please, send me a link, because I want to see all your stuff and, who knows, buy some.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x60;s all for the moment, friends of mine.</li>
    <li> So my hair is natural and I found this product to work very well. The only bad thing is the placement of the switch to turn it on and off. Its right on the top of the handle where you hold it, so I find I turn it off accidently all the time.&lt;br /&gt;It does get hot really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Overall not bad..</li>
    <li> So this is more ideal for people with thinner hair, I have thick hair and I find a flat iron more ideal for straightening, however this serves well to get your roots and edges, although you definitely need a wider toothed pressing comb to get new growth because I found that difficult to straighten too. And it doesn&#x27;t give a silk press like the old fashioned pressing combs, it more so lays your hair flat but it doesn&#x27;t adequately straighten it, invest in a flat iron and save this for touch ups.</li>
    <li> So wonderful for straightening short hair!</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of comments regarding the placement of the off button.. It personally hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me. I really do like this a lot! The fact that it has a temp. Adjuster just makes it that much better.. I wear weaves so I typically just use it on my edges and it gets the job done</li>
    <li> Although this comb got very hot, it did not straighten my hair as well as I would have liked. If you are looking for silky straight, this is not the product. Also the way the on an off button is position on the handle, you can easily hit the off button when using. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The temperature is fine.  I used it up to 10 on a scale that went to 20.  What I do not like is the fact that the on/off button sits right where my hand grips the handle and it turns it off.  I had to buy this in a hurry because my trusted electric pressing comb is 500 miles away in a storage space back home.  I did not have the same problem with that one as I did with the Andis.</li>
    <li> I was trying not to put any more perm in my hair and when that happens my hair get very wavy so I like to keep it straight but even though I blow dry it, it doesn&#x27;t get staright enough for me so I ordered this and it does the job nicely.  It gets very hot and I can press those waves right on out of y hair.</li>
    <li> Does what I want basically, which is to smooth the hair.  Would like it to have a thermostat to be more effective.</li>
    <li> My hair revert after a few hours, but good help for transitioning.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk. Sorry. Doesn&#x27;t get ethnic hair hot enough to straighten it.</li>
    <li> This, comb is excellent for my hair. It has the right amount of heat. I&#x27;m thankful to the other purchaser&#x27;s of this product for their honest reviews.</li>
    <li> This hot comb works well and straightens hair very good.  I tried several hot combs before but were very weak, cannot straighten hair.  Now I am so happy with Andis, my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
    <li> It is in the corner and the packaging, after using it I hated the results, which was nothing.</li>
    <li> Its good, a bit of a problem where the button placement is located. As I am pressing my hair, it sometimes turn off which is annoying, but none the less it does a good job.</li>
    <li> On off switch badly placed. I keep turning it off by mistake. But excellent heat.</li>
    <li> It works good for hair that is not extremely coarse. The extra sensitive power switch on the handle makes this about worthless. You have to grip it firmt to get through kinky hair, but if you grip it firm, it shuts off. If they can put a different power switch in a different location, it would be a great product.</li>
    <li> This press comb is really a waste of your money.  It doesn&#x27;t get very hot and the design is very poor. Every time you try to use it, you inadvertently turn it off because the on/off buttons are right where your thumb sits.  I wish I would have read all of the reviews.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> This was actually a purchase for my mom and judging by the actions of her day I&#x27;ve assumed that the product is to her liking. When I asked how has her brand new Andis High Heat Comb been working she replied that it had been working great and was a very good price for quality. A product with a comfortable interface. I would definitely recommend these as a gift or personal use.</li>
    <li> This product works well enough but maybe because my hair is very naturaly curly i have to use another product to straighten my hair then the hot comb to smooth it out and style.</li>
    <li> Work just ok was expecting better</li>
    <li> I have naturally spiral curls. And it I do not flat iron it often, but I got this to help when I decide to do it and it really work well. Just like the old fashion ironing comb, but with temperature control so I don&#x27;t fry my hair. I got one for my daughter as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product but I keep forgetting its a comb and keep burning my shoulders head and ears..</li>
    <li> oh My God this product is awful, pure waste of money, i brought it just because i saw a girl using it on youtube, i really regret waisting my money.  PLEASE DONT BUY IT WILL BURN YOUR SCALP because the all material get hot.</li>
    <li> So im mixed with black snd white my hair is on the tbicker side and more on the ethnic side this did not fo the job for me at the highest setting it would not do anything to my hair it was like combing it with a warm hotcomb sorry dont use if you have thicker course hair</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS PRESSING COMB IN COMBINATION WITH ***( Avlon KeraCare Creme Press 4 oz)&lt;br /&gt;THE TWO ITEMS SOLD TOGETHER AS A COMBO SET ! BEST TO BUY AND USE BOTH ITEMS TOGETHER IT&#x27;S ALSO A CHEAPER DEAL !!! THIS IS THE BEST HOT THERMAL COMB I EVER SEEN OR USED !!! LOVE THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL ON THIS. WHEN I USED THIS PRESSING COMB EVERYONE THOUGHT I HAD A PERM IN MY HAIR !!!&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT FOR AFRO- KINKY HAIR !  WON&#x27;T BURN YOUR HAIR !</li>
    <li> I Love this ceramic hot comb for quick touchups between relaxers. If only they had put the power button somewhere else because I have to keep watching to make sure I don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off. With each use I usually turn it off at least once, if not for this ergonomic flaw I would have gladly given it a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the fine hairs. I normally straighten my hair with a flat iron and i intended to use this to straighten the hairs near my forehead and the little hairs that i miss with the iron and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. There too much space between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to straighten course hair.  All products I&#x27;ve tried have done ok.  This is excellent.  It gets very very hot and straightens in a short amount of time.  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> The best hot comb pick up one for a friend.</li>
    <li> I was very glad to received the pressing comb. It did meet my expectations. I will tell others about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help me through the transition of going from relaxed hair to natural hair. It worked so well with my new growth! I couldn&#x27;t believe how straight my hair got. Really a great buy at a bargain.</li>
    <li> This will not straighten hair how it is supposed to. When on the highest heat setting (which isn&#x27;t hot enough) it will straighten a tight curl to a slightly looser curl, even after repeated pressings.</li>
    <li> Its a good comb but it start stripping early and causes damage to the hair shaft. Poor finish. Good product but doesnt last long.</li>
    <li> I HAVENT PERMED MY HAIR SINCE DECEMBER THIS REALLY WORK I WILL SAY I SWEATED MY HAIR OUT WITHIN 2 DAYS BUT THIS WAS A GREAT PRODUCT JUST NOT LONG TERM RESULTS</li>
    <li> Just no...used it once and put it in the closet...</li>
    <li> Great and uses just the. Right. Amount of heat . Sturdy and reliable product. I would order this item again&#x27;</li>
    <li> Gets as hot as i need it to. Gets the edges which is my biggest issue. Fast and easy in the mornings!&lt;br /&gt;Great buy! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price it should be like 10$ dollars it does not really straighten well, and im very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Does the job but very bulky and hard to reach your roots wish the ends where a little less bulky also the on/off switch keeps going off because of where its placed youre destined to press the off boton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say so not get this look for a better option</li>
    <li> Since my daughter has naturally curly hair, the heat was just right. The comb is a bit larger than I expected, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I tried using it again on March first and it will not work.  I ordered it on October 9th 2014. I will try and see  if  there is a way for me to exchange it for a good 1. It stopped working in less than 6 months.</li>
    <li> I really like everything about this curling iron with one exception... the placement of the On/Off button.&lt;br /&gt;While using the pressing comb, I found that I repeatedly(accidentally) turned it off because the button is located in the area that my fingers need to be placed for safe holding of the iron as well as styling control. I really like the adjustable heat control switch, and the fact that the comb heats up evenly and quickly. I appreciate having the nice little fold-out stand to keep the hot comb up and off the surface of my dressing table. The comb also features a nice long electrical cord for plugging it convenietly near my dressing table.</li>
    <li> Did what I need it to do.  Heats up extremely fast. Easy  to handle. Would recommend too anyone who is thinking about it.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I love my new pressing comb. When I ordered it I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work so well because of the price, but I used it a lot and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I am natural and sometimes when i want to press my hair out a flat iron doesn&#x27;t get the job done. with this comb I can get closer to the root and get my hair finished in a fair amount of time. It also helps that I can control the heat setting on this.</li>
    <li> The information given, gave me the impression that if was a smaller iron. Too bad. The iron works well but Im looking for a smaller iron. I have short hair and this iron is too big.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my pressing comb; it heats up quickly so you can get burned if you are not careful. Thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I have natural African-American hair which is very thick and coarse. I used this product and it worked exactly how I wanted it too. It straightened my new growth and ends. After using it, I used my friends straightener and my hair was stick straight.</li>
    <li> This makes keeping them edges tamed easy. If you&#x27;re looking for a quick press this is your tool. This, however, is not for a first timer. If you haven&#x27;t used a &amp;#34;hot comb&amp;#34; or know how to &amp;#34;press&amp;#34; hair please move on because this item is not for you.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely better than regular hair straighteners. It is easy to use, and it helps to straighten the roots easily. However, I burned my arm two times with this, because it is super hot, and there is nothing that covers the hot surface. You just should be very careful using it. I guess this is the same thing for every comb because of its shape. So, I would not put it on the brand.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. The flat iron does the job. The reason for the 3 star vs 4 or 5 is because the on/off buttons are placed in such a way (as a right-handed person who grips high on the handle) when I am flat ironing my hair I hit the off button quite often. It never turns off because I don&#x27;t hit it too hard, but it is annoying because I constantly have to check and make sure I didn&#x27;t turn it off by accident.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of heating, especially for an electric comb. The price is very reasonable. My only complaint is with whoever engineered this otherwise wonderful product. They put the on/off button  where you hold the comb and I keep turning the darn thing off!  Be nice if they change this on the next batch.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews about this comb, I purchased it and have been mostly satisfied with it. It heats up quickly and it presses my hair straight. I can get really close to the edges which I couldn&#x27;t do with my other comb. The one problem, like others have said, is that it takes a few weeks of using it to get the hang of holding it so that you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off. If the manufacturer found a way to place the on and off buttons in a more convenient location, I&#x27;d have rated it five stars. Other than that, I have really enjoyed the comb and would highly recommend it to anyone who has course hair that is difficult to straighten.</li>
    <li> It met what I was looking for. Looses or knots from my hair leaving it fluffy😀 love it</li>
    <li> It heats up really quickly and I don&#x27;t even have to use the highest setting like on my others, the only problem is that the buttons can get in the way sometimes and you can accidentally turn it off  but other than that I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> The pressing comb got the job done. The only thing that I do not like about the hot comb is the placement of the on and off switch. But good product if you want to get it straight... :P</li>
    <li> Im happy I bought the hot comb. First time users must find a way to handle it order not to burn oneself&lt;br /&gt;I guess due to my hair type, I don&#x27;t get close to the result I wish to see. Combining the hot comb and flat iron on my short natural hair straightens it just for one day. After a day, it shrinks again. But im not gonna give up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom about a year ago and it still works like it just came out of the box and shipping was fast and i would recommend this</li>
    <li> Great tool to assist in the straightening of natural hair. I love this product and recommend it for ladies that needs to pull a warm comb through the hair. Don&#x27;t misunderstand, the comb gets hot and it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the old school hot comb that my grandmother would use on my head. A lot safer and less neck burns LOL! The only problem I have is( like a few other reviewers said) the location of the on/off buttons. You will accidentally turn the hot comb off a couple times if you grip too tightly or place your hand in the wrong spot. Other than that, you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first electric press comb i&#x27;ve had...and I love it.  I have relaxed hair except for about an inch and a half of new growth.  I use this comb to straighten the new growth. It works great with a little oil.  It also gets very hot.</li>
    <li> The Andis hot comb is just ok for me.  I have natural hair that I have been wearing very short and curly for the last 4 years.  I recently started growing it out and it is just long enough to get one bend of a curl in it.  I bought this to straighten the hair for styling.  I have course, thick hair and needed it around 16 out of the 20 heat settings to even see a difference.  The placement of the buttons and contols are in an awkward space on the top.  I find that I am turning it off, up or down in the process.  That was frustrating so I didn&#x27;t get to do my whole head.  With this hair, parting and doing each section takes time.  I didn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t have the time to check the settings after each pass.  It is in my hair drawer for now, not sure when and if I will use it again.</li>
    <li> This comb does not get very hot at all...hot to the touch but once on hair it did a horrible job.  My daughter has wavy hair that is pretty soft and this just did not get the job done.  I was trying to decide between this or another flat iron.  From reading the reviews I thought it sounded great but I was wrong. And the placement of the on and off button makes no sense.  You have to keep making sure you havent turned it off.</li>
    <li> I was worried about buying a electrical one because I&#x27;ve been so attached to the one you just heat on the stove but I LOVE this!! It&#x27;s much more convenient than the regular one! It gets REALLY hot and does a great job at pressing the hair! Recommend this to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for anyone sporting a natural do. This think heats up super fast and gets your hair super straight. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I am growing out my relaxer and this is a wonderful tool to help you get by. It&#x27;s easy to use and the settings are a great feature for different hair types.</li>
    <li> My hair is relaxed and works great on my new growth. I would recommend this comb to anyone whom wants their hair to look great all the time.</li>
    <li> I love having this controlled hotcomb. It does a good job on my African-American thick coarse hair. I reccommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me :-(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this pressing comb. Mainly because my hair is thin and the space between the combs teeth are spread out a little further than I need them to be for my hair type. I have deep curly and wavy hair when wet and can blow dry it straight but prefer for my hair to be straightened bone straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be wonderful for anyone with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second one and this seems to be working perfectly.  I like it</li>
    <li> So far so good I got it yesterday working fine hasn&#x27;t burned my hair out... LOL</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the intention of using it to get the areas that my ceramic flat couldn&#x27;t get, mainly the roots in the front. My daughter and I are natural (no relaxer) and have 4b/c hair. This product worked great at getting the areas of my hair that needed strengthening. As with other customers, the only concern I have is the position of the buttons. You must be careful not to touch them when pressing which is difficult. Perhaps the manufacturers need to reconsider the design without taking away functionality. Besides, that the product worked great!</li>
    <li> Hot enough to get the kicks out only con is where the button is located easily turned off while trying to straigthen my hair.</li>
    <li> This comb worked great on my hair when I was transitioning from my relaxer for the first four months, but after my hair became more natural and less relaxed it stopped working.  Now, I find that flat irons work best to straighten my hair. The flat irons I use are [[ASIN:B003AJLQ4W Sedu Revolution Tourmaline Ionic Styling Iron 1\\&quot; - Black]] and [[ASIN:B002LIXTFC Remington S9951 Shine Therapy Frizz Control, Humidity Resistant Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron, 1 Inch]].</li>
    <li> Much bigger than what i expected.</li>
    <li> The only problem I have is this press comb does not have wide teeth, so you have to be careful the comb does not snag your hair.  You can easily adjust the heat settings.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that the turn on and off button is so close to your fingers but I like it.  It heat is great</li>
    <li> AAAAAAAAAAAA + + + + product and service</li>
    <li> I would never buy again.  It does not heat up all the way even on the highest and the power button is so close to whenre you hold the product that i find myself turning it on and off easily while using it.  Wish i returned it earlier!</li>
    <li> This product works decent on my 4c hair. My only problem is that my hair is uneven in some places and the comb doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;catch\\&quot; it all, which leads to some coarse and some straight pieces of hair. It does straighten my hair to a good degree. Some parts don&#x27;t come out as straight as I want but I think it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m left handed and can&#x27;t really get the right side of my head correctly which is also where the uneven part is. All in all when my hair grows out and I can spend more time and find the right straightening lotion/gel/spray to go with it I think this product would be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT** NOT good for 4c hair. After a few months of trying to straighten my hair in many different ways it still ends up mostly puffy and hard. I went back to my mother&#x27;s OLD SCHOOL stove hot comb and I can tell the difference. My hair is smooth and soft, and noticeably LESS puffy than when using the electric hot comb. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for really coarse African American hair like mine. I&#x27;d suggest we stick to the old school formula that worked. Stove top hot combs it is!</li>
    <li> Sorry, but the on and off button is a real problem. If you BARELY touch it while using comb, it goes off. I find it both ackward and annoying to continuously have to remind myself of how to place my hand to avoid the on and off button! it just shouldn&#x27;t be that easy to turn off by just brushing the button while in use. Too much!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve forgotten how to press my hair but it just wouldn&#x27;t look like it used to...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a biracial woman with very thick, long, and curly hair. This works great! Be sure to use a great heat protectant.</li>
    <li> I love this hot comb, it&#x27;s much more sturdier than the hot tools one I owned. I loved that one, but it started bending and the parts near the comb part started breaking and I was terrified one day while I was doing my edges that it would fall on my face so I decided to invest into a new one. This one is great, it has a good quality feel to it, I don&#x27;t see it breaking any time soon, it also has a 5 year unheard of warranty (most appliances are only 1 year), and it&#x27;s sturdy, heats up fast (30 sec), it has an auto on and off it&#x27;s just great. I am use to multiple heat settings so I love that as well. Great comb, excellent price!</li>
    <li> This pressing comb is exactly what the kink doctor ordered.  I have used it for straightening after shampoo/conditioner and for touch-ups.  It is great, heats up quickly, and really smoothes hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment good quality</li>
    <li> Whatever the metal is plated with, started to come off after three to four uses.  I thought this would change the quality of the work of the product but it did not.  I am overall happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no complaints about this product, and I&#x27;ve used it many times. It heats up pretty quickly and does not leave hair my looking frizzy.</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought the elcetric hot comb would not be as good as the stove top version,  well its better. I like being able to choose heat settings and not having to do my hair in the kitchen. I would have rated this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the on/off button. The way its placed you will constantly turn the comb off while straightning hair. Overall its still a good product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scalp burns, they make newer hot combs now that don&#x27;t burn your scalp. This is a tad dated but was useful when I needed it</li>
    <li> Due to the texture of my hair, it could heat up a little hotter without damaging effects. Quality comb; smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with short permed hair. I like my hot comb, but the off button is in a spot were it is easily pushed while styling my hair. Regardless, it does straighten my hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> Love this and it is great for smoothing out edges or roots! IT gets the job done and is definitely an investment!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t straighten one bit ! I&#x27;m mixed black and white and my hair isn&#x27;t course (its wavey). This product is meant if you can&#x27;t get a straightener through your hair.</li>
    <li> Great heat setting options. Wish the off button wasn&#x27;t where hand has to hold handle because my hand turns it offconstantly while in use.</li>
    <li> After looking tirelessly in the beauty supply and department stores, I finally decided to look online to find this product. There were a couple selections, but the ease of use and price were my reasons to purchase. The on/off button is right where my thumb is and I sometimes shut it off accidentally, but I have learned to hold it along the sides. The comb heats up fairly quickly. You just need to be mindful of the little arm that the comb rests on when using. I would definitely recommend it. It works great.</li>
    <li> I feel like this product is ok. It could stand to do better at straightening my hair, but it does smoothen it</li>
    <li> Well this product is just right. I haven&#x27;t used a straightening comb&lt;br /&gt;since the 60&#x27;s. I decided to go back to it. This comb fits the bill.</li>
    <li> The hand swivels to much when using. The grip is too large and you accidentally turn the comb off while using.</li>
    <li> This would be a perfect (5 star) hot comb except for the placement of the on/off buttons. You can&#x27;t get around it shutting off every time you pick it up to use it. Extremely annoying. It works very well for me except for this design flaw. I devised a way to get around that in order to continue using it. I took the plastic cap from a razor and taped over the buttons while using it, works, except you have to remove it and re-tape when you need to use it the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be willing to pay just a little more if the manufacturer would design a cover that flips up to turn on and off so that your hand doesn&#x27;t come in contact with the controls or put the controls on the electrical cord like some well designed hair curlers.</li>
    <li> Love this comb.  Easy to use and the hi heat gets the job done.  I don&#x27;t even need the hottest setting.</li>
    <li> This product has ceased to work the comb had simply quit heating up I am totally frustrated by this turn of events I just purchased it from Amazon in May, and it was literally used no more than three times and now it will not heat at all the red LED light continues to flash constantly and never stops...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine i&#x27;m going to have to buy a new one i&#x27;m very disappointed with this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And getting a refund from Amazon is not worth the significant effort required or money spent to actually get the refund the process is very ABSTRACT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of Money Puffy Frizzy Hair this is turning out to be the worst bad hair day ever.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I feel like I just got rickrolled?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;m off to find a new styling steed to tame my locks, And yes i&#x27;m buying it from Amazon but of course they have the best deals I never say defeat I will have my stallion yet...</li>
    <li> loovvvve it its great on ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> Has a heat adapter. Hair is smooth and soft. Nice sized comb. The comb has a nice style and look to it</li>
    <li> I LOVE THAT I CAN MAKE MY ROOTS STRAIGHT.... I HAVE REALLY CURLY HAIR AND SOMETIMES I JUST WANT TO KEEP MY HAIR CURLY BUT SOFTEN MY ROOTS AND THIS WORKS VERY, VERY WELL....</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the product description more closely. I wish this were ceramic. It&#x27;s NOT ceramic, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective product.  It heats up quickly and does an excellent job of straightening hair.  I use a lower setting and it still gets the job done.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is an ok hot comb. It is easily turned off because of the position of the on button and how it has to be held. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This comb is awesome and convenient!</li>
    <li> THIS COMB DOES NOT WORK WELL ON COARSE HAIR:(</li>
    <li> Wife says this was a good buy. She says it does the job.</li>
    <li> Coating started wearing off of this comb the very first time I ever used it. I have very coarse and thick hair, this comb did not heat up enough to successfully straighten it.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It does not pull or damage the hair and it heats up quickly.  The only down side is that the temperature control is miss placed, allowing your hand to hit the controls by mistake.  I still love it though.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent straightening job in very little time, and does not snag my hair, and also conditions it. The on/off switch on the comb does get in the way on occassion during styling, but if you flip it back, it retains its heat without the wait. Once you&#x27;re used to using it, that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> Only issue is location of on/off button as per many other reviews</li>
    <li> It gets hot... But definitely doesn&#x27;t replace the old school hot combs and get everything nice and straight...it&#x27;s was just okay...</li>
    <li> This is the first electric hot comb that actually reaches the desired heat level and maintains the heat throughout the pressing process.Arrived promptly and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job of straightening. Easy to avoid pressing the buttons while using by holding it appropriately. Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I really loved using the iron and it helps with my natural texture tresses. This isn&#x27;t just like my grandmoms&#x27; but it close to it. I even used on my friend&#x27;s daughters hair and she loved her almost bone straight texture without having to have a chemical process in her hair!</li>
    <li> In between salon visits I use this hotcomb to straighten my hair that is not in my weave. This hot comb is perfect for getting my roots really well without even using the highest heat setting. If you really know how to use a hot comb you will have no problem getting your roots or have to worry about burning yourself like some other reviewers stated. I do agree with the reviewers who said the on/off switch is in a place where its easy to accidentally turn it off, but like they also said,  once you get used to it, there is really no problem. I would recommend this product. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Considered it 4 stars because the position of on/off button is in location that makes it too easy to shut it off. Temperature is easy to control</li>
    <li> Good item fast shipping</li>
    <li> This comb was horrible it frizzes your hair, it does not straighten it. It was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this hot comb if you are expecting a good look from straightening yor hair and you are african american. it dos not get hot enough to do the job. true disappointment from an Andis product. i am usually very satisfied.  i would return it if i hadnt used it already.  Regretful purchase.</li>
    <li> The comb&#x27;s teeth were too short and too close together to be effective even for my thin hair. On/off switch is right on the handle and i kept accidentally turning them off w/o realizing. Had to return.</li>
    <li> As someone with &amp;#34;3c/4a&amp;#34;  hair who often uses a professional flat iron,  this pressing comb is nice (and affordable) addition to my arsenal of hair care tools.  It heats up quickly, and stays hot throughout use.  It allows the user to get a little more &amp;#34;traction&amp;#34; on those edges that even the best flat iron will miss.  You do have to be careful not to burn yourself,  especially if you didn&#x27;t grow up using the old fashioned pressing combs.  And you have to watch out for the tendency to click off the iron because of the placement of the controls.  (The placement of the buttons is really why I can&#x27;t give it a perfect 5 stars.)  But I  would recommend this iron as a well-made and truly functional product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My wife is African American and I bought this pressing comb for her.  She loves it.  It heats up nicely and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Perfect when you need to get them edges!!!</li>
    <li> This pressing comb getting hot very fast and press my little girl&#x27;s hair very good.The only probable I have is the on/off button, it is very easy to turn off without knowing.</li>
    <li> I have very short curly hair and thought this would be perfect just to quickly comb out the frizziness, but the hot combs burned my scalp!  Ouch!  Returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> I am only giving this hot comb two stars for its design. I mean why would you put the buttons on the handle where it is the most comfortable and stable to hold? I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve touched up my new growth and turned the darn thing off. But it does work very well despite its poor design.</li>
    <li> So far, this is an amazing hot comb. Gets really hot and leaves hair shiny and healthy looking. My only complaint (and thus the 4 stars instead of 5) is that the power buttons are in the exact place where you hold the hot comb leading to accidentally turning the comb off at times.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome the biggest selling point was the dual voltage due to my military status.  The comb is wonderful and heats up really fast.  This is a keeper no more on the stove burning the ear or back of the neck.</li>
    <li> I remember my mother using the stove-heated hot combs when I was younger on my hair and since I decided to stop relaxing my hair, I figured that I&#x27;d try this hot comb to get the straight look as I desired. I bought this product and used it but after a few minutes, I realized that this product isn&#x27;t the best for VERY thick afro hair. If made my hair a bit lighter after 3 strokes but I needed to comb it through with a regular comb first ( which causes some hair breakages) then use the hot comb (which caused even more breakage). I eventually just used the Remington flat iron that I had bought along with this product, which got my hair much straighter than the hot comb. For the hot comb to deliver the desired, relatively straighter result, you would have to section your hair in very small sections, which was not necessary with the flat iron. So I decided to only use the flat iron which cause significantly less breakage compared to this hot comb.</li>
    <li> Just bought the Andis electric straightening comb, and tried to use it to straighten my hair. But, because of the awkward placement of the on/off buttons, I kept turning the darn thing off. Since I use an electric comb to avoid the necessity of re-heating the comb, like you have to with the stove-top variety, this is a big turn-off (pun intended) for me.</li>
    <li> I like the product but I wish the combs were Closer together. it&#x27;s hard to get my new growth because the combs are not that close together plus I have thin hair.</li>
    <li> this comb doesnt even work rite because it doesnt even get the hair straight and it is a problem to comb hair</li>
    <li> This gets super hot so make sure to test it first to make sure it&#x27;s not too hot for you. I like that it gets in the roots of your hair to straighten. Doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as a flat iron but it does get the kinks and curls out.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied. It is what i expected it to be</li>
    <li> Great product.  Arrive on time.</li>
    <li> I own a stove top pressing comb and occasionally it would get too hot and burn my hair, so I decided to buy the Andis Pressing comb and it works wonders. My hair is straight and doesn&#x27;t mess like burn. I adore the heat settings that allows me to tailor it to my needs or someone else. Also this is the second time I&#x27;m buying is product. The first time my sister fell in love with and convinced me to buy another...for myself.</li>
    <li> happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> The control button is right on the handle which makes it hard for you to use because as you are using it the comb will turn off from the touch and you have to constantly keep turning it back on. The control works better on the extension cord. I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It works very good, did the job I was expecting for my 4c course hair. Love love love....</li>
    <li> The temperature control is located where you hold your thumb and you can raise temp to hot.  It gets really hot but have to  awkwardly hold comb to keep from changing controls.</li>
    <li> The on/ off button isn&#x27;t put at the right place! I thought it will get hotter ! It doesn&#x27;t  Smoothen en shine my hair ! But it does straighten the hair. Maybe not my best choose, now looking for another!!</li>
    <li> The heat control buttons are located in an awful position.It is hard to use the comb without accidentally turning the comb off. The&lt;br /&gt;comb heats very well when I manage to keep it on. I would not recommend this comb to a friend!!!</li>
    <li> This product does straighten your hair. Be sure to follow the recommended instructions, especially, when considering the type of hair you have (fine or coarse). Great product.</li>
    <li> My old electric hot com broke after 10 years and since they didn&#x27;t make that model anymore I jumped at the chance to buy this one. I regret it because it was a waste of money!! My daughter and I have very thick African american hair that naps up after washing. I found that even if I detangled our hair and blow dry it beforehand the comb still turns and gets loose. The worst part is that they placed the on/off buttons right where u would place your hand, so it often gets cut off during styling. I have no complaints about the end result of my hair but the comb itself is a big hassle!! ***You really would be better off buying: http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Tools-Professional-1150-Multi-heat/product-reviews/B0002M80KS/ref&#x3D;dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb has better settings and prevents burning yourself. I mean you can really see why they priced the Andis comb cheaper because of the quality of the comb.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had relaxer in almost 4 years but I still like to have my hair strengthened.  I bought this hoping I could learn to do it myself and save on paying someone and ITS AWESOME.  It gets just as hot as the traditional hot comb and I didn&#x27;t burn myself once.  My style lasted just as long as when the traditional hot comb is used as well and that means alot when you have very kinky course hair.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Worked well with my fine African American hair. Easy to control the temperature. It is easy to accidently turn it off because of the location of the on and off buttons.</li>
    <li> Firstly, the on and off button are placed in the location where you would grip the hot comb which made it hard to use in the first place. Second, the times the hot comb actually did turn on for me and get hot after about two runs through my hair the heat shut off. This hot comb makes the job of pressing your hair even more difficult than it needs to be. I do not recommend at all. Returning mine!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and convenient. Works but the one on the stove just works better. Also the off button is right where you hold the comb while using it so every time i grab it i turn it off. Overall I like it but love it.</li>
    <li> I like this heating comb so much it gets so hot i keep it on 10 most of the time it starts from 1 and goes up to 20 if you put the comb on 20 it burns like the stove so does 15 that&#x27;s why i keep mine on 10 sometime ten can be pretty hot too and i have to bring it on down to 5 just right for me wondering why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the On and Off button on the handle part and i keep hitting the off button you can see it in the picture what i&#x27;m talking about but other than that so far this is a good pressing comb i just purchased it March 13, 2013 again this is a good one and i would recommend this pressing comb to anyone.</li>
    <li> This pressing comb is amazing! I have thick, coarse, big hair and this comb got it pretty straight. Best comb I&#x27;ve ever tried hands down!!!</li>
    <li> It takes forever to heat it up and when it does heat up it doesnt heat up. I&#x27;ve owned pressing combs that probably cost $5- $10 bucks that get hotter than this. This thing is WACK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shayla</li>
    <li> This hot press comb is the ideal choice for hair that is too young to be permed. It is for my granddaughter and it works well. Her mom and I both love it.</li>
    <li> The power button is located in a weird spot so gets hit often. The product doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to hold a press. I love the idea of the product but just doesn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
    <li> I really liked how it straightened my hair &amp; my edges. I wish I would have gotten a smaller comb.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for it....it&#x27;s difficult to not burn your scalp since the metal part is all hot. It arrived fast though.</li>
    <li> I never thought that they would make a heat comb that is good, I was mistaken, this one is excellent and you can adjust it to whatever is comfortable to your hair. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse thick african american hair and I&#x27;m not sayin that it doesn&#x27;t get your hair straight but for my type of hair it doesn&#x27;t really gets it all the way straight it does straighten it a little but not all the way like I expected because my hair be still very much thick afterwards</li>
    <li> The best purchase I ever did.  The product did exactly as stated in the packet.  Result.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and works wonders for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is brown short hair.  The Comb is big. .  compared to the picture. like wise  ,does a great job with Hair!</li>
    <li> Good thing I didn&#x27;t listen to the reviews that said this doesn&#x27;t get hot and that the on/off bottom is in a bad place. Well, this get&#x27;s very hot and I used it numerous times and NEVER had an issue with the on&amp; off switch.It works great.I certainly would recommend it to any one who is in between perms. If you&#x27;re trying to take your hair from an afro to straight, this may not be for you. But for basic use, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This was the best idea to be patent!</li>
    <li> This hot comb works great. I have very thick, coarse, hair and it can be difficult to comb through. This hot comb gets very hot and straightens my hair well and lasts a long time. Some reviewers have said that it does not work but it&#x27;s hard to believe that anyone would have a hard time getting this comb to straighten their hair given how hot the comb can get and the fact that the ceramic gold coating doesn&#x27;t rip through your hair. Like the other reviewers said the on/off switch is in a location where you will likely need to check to make sure you didn&#x27;t turn it off while you are using it. I would still recommend it though.</li>
    <li> This was horrible. The button placement is the pits. You cant hold the comb without turning the unit off. Then you have to wait for it to reheat. It also didnt get hot enough to straighten my dense 4abc hair.</li>
    <li> Great for me.  Easy to use and heat is controllable unlike my previous one where it is difficult to control the heat so I won&#x27;t burn out my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> This comb does get very hot but I agree with many others...the off/on button does get in the way.  I purchased this thru amazon at a great price.  I did check targets in my area but they didn&#x27;t have straightening combs at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product i was a little scared when I purchased it. But after receiving and using it I fell in love with it. It gets hot but easy to manage. I would say all females who are just going natural and need some heat get this item</li>
    <li> It gets too hot for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a tricky Heat Press Comb. The on and off button are in the WRONG PLACE. They designed it right where you hold it when doing your hair. I sent mine right back, poor design, couldn&#x27;t open the sealed package. It cut me on my fingers like 5 different places. Please DO NOT ORDER THIS, IT&#x27;S THE WORST.</li>
    <li> I liked it because it has different temperature settings that will stay the same temp and not overheat when using</li>
    <li> This pressing comb does not work on my hair.  I have natural 4b-c hair.  I wish I listened to the other reviewers.  The teeth are too far apart to be effective.  I am still using my flat iron to get the job done.</li>
    <li> The heat control button and off button is in the way of my fingers.  Control buttons are often changed or turned off without my knowledge of it.</li>
    <li> works well - well made</li>
    <li> This comb has a nice weight, like the older stove combs of the past, and does not pull my hair like the one it is replacing.  It heats relatively fast and just hot enough for my fragile, grey, thinning hair.  The only issue I have is the location of the controls, which are on top of the handle making it easy to turn the comb off.  I try holding onto the back part of the handle, but it is a bit too short, making control iffy.  Otherwise, it is a nice comb and I like it.  As I said, the weight is nice, and the heat is not extreme (no smoking or smelly hair from being burned).  The on light flashes rather frequently as an indication it is maintaining the set temperature.  A nice comb, but probably has a newer design.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an african american woman with natural hair and purchased this for occasions when I want a different look. Maybe I&#x27;m not using this correctly but it did not straighten my hair at all.</li>
    <li> Works great... Love it</li>
    <li> The comb was loose upon arrival so it was a burn hazard because it twirled. The screw to tighten it was not visible but i observed a hole then filed down a bobbie pin to use to attempt to tighten which worked. i don&#x27;t know how long it will continue tightened but it straightens my hair well. i do not have very course hair and i use a professional comb press sheen which make a huge difference in the straightening process. I am in limbo with purchasing a second comb just in case this one begins to twirl from often use.</li>
    <li> Awesome product heats up very fast! Get really hot and is good for edges and new growth! 4 stars because the power button is easily turned off so be careful</li>
    <li> Does not get as hot as I thought it would. Easy to use but not very good for very thick hair</li>
    <li> This is a great pressing comb. I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of the electric ones, as I grew up with mom using the one for the stove on my hair. Good ole days! But I&#x27;m very impressed with this one. It gets extremely hot. The heat setting goes up to 20, but I used around 15 and that was enough. The teeth of the comb may look big, but they&#x27;re really not. And after all, you do need enough space for your hair to comfortably slide through, and using a wider tooth is best for ethnic or very thick hair anyway. With that said, the teeth are not too big. Overall, it did an excellent job of straightening. I bought it to keep my roots straight in between relaxers, so I straighten my roots with the comb and use a flat iron for the rest of my hair. My hair type is thick, but not very coarse. My real gripe with the comb is a trend I saw in other reviews as well: the On/Off buttons. They could have been more strategically placed because I don&#x27;t even remember how many times I accidentally turned it off when using it. Because of that, I have to hold it a certain way, but I guess you get used to it. I bought mine from Target, and it was $19.99.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the one reviewer who says the on/off buttons are in an awful position.  As you use the comb, you&#x27;re constantly turning the darn thing off.  The teeth in the comb are also either sharp or too close together for my hair. I had alot of hair in the comb after each section. I&#x27;m transitioning so I have about 7 months of new growth. I detangled well, so not sure why it pulled out so much hair. I also burned myself a few times trying to avoid the on/off button and the swivel cord. The comb is big and heavy and not ideal for someone like me who has small hands and wrists. It did get the job done but it was alot of work.  Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and I probably won&#x27;t use it again either.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this.  The placement  of the on/off button is useless.  This staighting comb is good for hair that is not curse.</li>
    <li> If you have used the old style pressing comb you are going to love this. You can take it any where, and it heats up so fast. I love it!</li>
    <li> This hot comb is ridiculously awesome... way better than traditional hot combs! Don&#x27;t get me wrong you can burn yourself! But the results are way better! My daughter and I both have natural hair and I use this tool every now and then to check length or change up looks doesn&#x27;t affect curl pattern or any thing! Love it and you really can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality!</li>
    <li> I only tried this once. Wouldnt recommend for people with thick course hair. It wont even get hot. My advice is to watch a couple of YouTube.com videos on how to use a real hot comb off the stove. I got once from local beauty supply store for 7 bucks. Works great too. Gets my hair straight and silky and I havent had a relaxer In 5 yrs so you know this hair need some real heat lol</li>
    <li> Works great ,only complaint is the button is in an weird place ..keep turning it off , but like I said it works great...</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a electric hotcomb that I have been using for 10 years. The other one never really pressed my hair. This really presses the hair without burning it. I recommend using the settings of 10 or 15.</li>
    <li> This comb simply does not get hot enough to straighten coarse hair and you&#x27;ll keep turning it off because the power button is placed right where your hand grips the handle.</li>
    <li> I am growing out my perm and my edges are not looking so hot (I&#x27;m still growing out my scab hair). So I bought this for my edges. With the help of you tube videos, I&#x27;ve been able to get my edges bone straight:) what else can u ask for? Oh, also it heats up pretty gosh darn fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. While the ceramic plating makes it safer for hair, don&#x27;t forget to&lt;br /&gt;Use heat protectant!!!</li>
    <li> It is just okay. It does not get that hot and the design is terrible.</li>
    <li> Simply put, it gets hot fast enough, but the controls are in a terrible location. If you are right handed, your fingers will constantly move the tempurature wheel and/or turn the comb off. The on/off put ends up under your thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it did when I first go it maybe 3 months ago. The gold coating flakes off into my hair.</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair and I guess I was trying to \\&quot;cheap-out\\&quot; with this Andis hot comb. But you get what you pay for and this did not work for my hair. After a fresh wash and dry my hair usually comes out slick as butter with a hot comb. Unfortunately not with this comb. I will be going back to Gold N Hot products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lightweight. Swivel cord. Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Teeth on the comb are too far apart and therefore do not grab all the hairs. The heat dial is located on the side so when in use your hand keeps changing the temp. Heat is not consistant and takes about 10 minutes to get to full heat capacity. Don&#x27;t think this model is for coarse African American hair.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
    <li> Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;my hair is natural using the ironing makes combing my hair very easy .&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend purchasing .</li>
    <li> Hot comb that gets really hot so be careful so don&#x27;t get heat damage.  I am african american with thick coarse hair and it gets the job done. My only complaint is the off button is too easily pressed and it will be shut off without you knowing it.  But other than that its a really great pressing comb.</li>
    <li> Not as hot as the previous comb I had but it works well.</li>
    <li> The Andis Heat Pressing Comb did very well to press my hair.  I appreciated the fact that the comb heats quickly AND has an AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF feature!  It is great, in my opinion, on coarse and curly hair.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I use to hate getting my hair hot combed as a child,but this is so easy and quick to use. It straightness my natural nappy hair easy.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. She doesn&#x27;t care for it to much. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for her</li>
    <li> After being use to my mom using the old school stove press and comb, I finally had a chance to buy an electric one and this is simply amazing. I love it. My hair looks fabulous!</li>
    <li> Not as good as it seems.. it doesnt heat that well and it doesnt straighten the hair properly. I wouldnt recommend</li>
    <li> This comb is easy to clean after use.  I do not like the stand because it does catch some of your hair.</li>
    <li> Love it!! It gets me thru my rough hair days. Have been natural almost all my life so this helps out when I want the straight look</li>
    <li> Useless. But even worth the money I paid</li>
    <li> nice comb with quick and even heat. It works fine but the tines are a little far apart making it hard get baby hair completely straight. Also, like other reviews state, the on button is in an awkward place so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally turn off during use, but it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these hot combs today. used it once and it seems to be working so far but I need to use it some more to really see the results. The buttons really do come off if you do not pay attention to what you are doing because it is in the way of your fingers while pressing your hair. It does get very hot as well. Cannot put it too close to your scalp beacuse it will burn very badly. Will keep you updated on my progress with it.</li>
    <li> I like the electrical outlet and it gets really hot. The ceramic protects the hair! try it now, no worries!</li>
    <li> It does a very nice job getting your hair straight and gets very hot too!!</li>
    <li> I received item as promised and immediately had to try it out.  It is great; I love it!  It heats up very rapidly and it stays at one temp unless setting is changed.  The con is; my hand always hits the off/on button and turns it off sometimes but it has great performance.</li>
    <li> Product is as described. Gets very hot, I like that. It also has a built in timer which turns the comb off after a long period of time.</li>
    <li> This product definitely did nothing for my hair. I even tried flat ironing it first then using the andis high heat and it still didn&#x27;t straighten my hair one bit. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to return this item with minimum problems.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve gone through about 4 different styles of electric hot combs over the last 2 yrs. including the edge control barrel product. cheaper styles seem to work ok for a few wks then die on me... this one is great because i can control the temp settings. i am Black and have hair grade 8/10 in level of kinkiness... i don&#x27;t even have to use it on the highest level and it leaves my hair silky straight and shiny.</li>
    <li> I like to use a pressing comb on my natural hair so that it is faster and easier when I flat iron it. Running the comb through my hair real quick (especially the root area) cuts my flat ironing time down to 10 mins. I was using the regular gold-plated pressing comb. It gave the best and fastest press but I noticed my hair was kind of thin afterwards. So to cut down on damage I bought this ceramic pressing comb. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the gold-plated comb but it gets hot enough to do the job, just with a few extra strokes. It leaves my hair full of body so I can tell that this comb is not doing too much damage as the gold-plated comb seemed to be doing. Overall, this is a great buy if you want to press your hair with little to no visible damage and cut down and in some cases eliminate flat iron usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this comb for hair that is coarse AND thick (the gold-plated comb is better suited for that hair type).</li>
    <li> My girls loved this comb. The only issue is when in use, your hand touches the controls and shuts off the heat, you have to continue to watch to make sure it stays on.</li>
    <li> Its very professional hot comb. works like i went to a professional salon standards. I no longer perm my hair. is very excellent I may have to use this 1or 2x a week I am an African American woman</li>
    <li> I would have given a five star, but the on and off button is in a bad place and when you;re using the comb, the iron turns off. This can be annoying. It does work well.</li>
    <li> I have really thick curly hair and have used everything out there on my hair to make it lay flat. After using this hot comb it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel dry it felt smooth and nice after I love it. This is a product worth buying.</li>
    <li> Item just as described. Great price. The on/off button seems to be right where I hold it but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this comb, I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be able to withstand my extremely coarse hair. I have a flat iron that heats to 450 degrees (like this comb), but because of it&#x27;s design, it was unable to flatten the hair near my neck, or above my ears. The Andis High Heat Press Comb flattened my hair so well, it looked like my hair was treated with a chemical relaxer! I absolutely LOVE this comb. I would recommend this comb to anyone with extremely coarse hair.</li>
    <li> If needed for non professional use perfect. Heat temperature is GREAT. The  on an off switch is too close to where your hand holds the comb and causes the hand to touch the  off switch, so you have to hold comb in an uncomfortable position in order that your hand does not touch off button. Unfortunate because the comb otherwise is perfect. I work with the inconvenience because I am touching up my edges only, but would not work to press an entire head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok,I have thick fine hair and I needed a comb that could replicate the salon experience without the heat damage...I like it but like the other comments stated- you constantly press the on/off switch by accident,it&#x27;s so annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, i like it, it is what it is ,and personally I feel that you shouldn&#x27;t OVER use any hot styling tool when doing your hair.So on that note, it&#x27;s NOT a salon hot comb, nor your grandmas kitchen stove hot comb, it&#x27;s good for finishing and cleaning the edges.</li>
    <li> My mother has one that works great! I ordered mine...and it worked great. Then, about 3 weeks later it just stopped working. Meh.</li>
    <li> Gets HOT, so be careful. Gets HOT quick so watch the surface. Good price and very portable. Cleans well. Need a comb for the baby hair? This works!</li>
    <li> It works ok but it broke in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fine, but every time I try to grip the handle to prevent burning myself, I turn it off. The design should have been a bit different to prevent this. I&#x27;ve only used it once and found that I turned it off by accident...UGH!</li>
    <li> Okay so I have to say I did some extensive research on a lot of hot combs and even though there are SOME times where if you&#x27;re holding the iron and combing it towards you it Will turn off cause your hand is pushing down on it-I STILL LOVE IT! it happened maybe twice during the entire time of pressing my natural 4a hair! MUST USE A HEAT SERUM for ideal results. So if you hold the handle with 3 fingers guide it with your INDEX finger on the back and when its time to comb PUSH YOUR THUMB in that small circle that shows the HEAT SETTINGS- you&#x27;ll do FINE! Also too, use the base of the comb to loosen the curl pattern alongside the root before you comb each section thru. I have never even understood why anyone with less than kinky hair would buy this. To put it simply, if you never needed a hot comb to straighten your hair as a child, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. They have hot air brushes for textures less than afro. *extra tip- seal each section with a mini ceramic iron and it will seal in all that heat and give you a nice shine!</li>
    <li> Fingers can&#x27;t help but to constantly hit the cut off button, because it is located on the handle where grip is needed.&lt;br /&gt;One is not aware the comb is off and cooling in the middle of pressing a section.</li>
    <li> This pressing comb works exceptionally well. I use it in between relaxers top avoid using the chemicals add often on my hair. It smoothes my new growth as well as the stove type. I gave it 4 stars because you have to be careful not to accidentally turn the temperature dial up higher while using it. It is very easy to do this while holding the handle. Otherwise, awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. Ii has a little stand that wont make surface burned. It also has a gage to balance the heat.</li>
    <li> A very good value for money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went natural in 2010 and since then did not want to ruin my hair with hair relaxer. I browsed the internet trying to find a good hot comb. This one stood out with a good value for money, so I decided to give it a try despite a few negative reviews by Amazon&#x27;s customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my type of hair, very coarse, I set it between 5 and 10 (I never went beyond 10). This is good if you just want to detangle your hair, keep them curled, and have volume (Afro). If that can help, here is how I worked my hair:&lt;br /&gt;- I washed and conditioned the hair&lt;br /&gt;- I dried and applied cream on hair as usual&lt;br /&gt;- I tied the hair in small parts to ease the job (I had no one to help)&lt;br /&gt;- I progressively applied a very small amount of conditioning spray to protect the hair from the heat. I used the deep conditioning spray with shea butter by Cantu.&lt;br /&gt;*** However, APPLY THE SPRAY IN A DIFFERENT ROOM than the one where you use the hot comb (read the user guide carefully!)&lt;br /&gt;- obviously, I used the hot comb starting from the back of my head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, we all have different ways to work our hair. What I liked with the 5 to 10 settings is that a week later, after the second shampoo, the texture of my hair was back to natural. So, I think it&#x27;s great if your concern is to monitor how you want your hair to look like.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, 30 seconds are enough to reach the temperature you want and it stays constant until you switch it off.</li>
    <li> This hot comb fits what I need. Not overly pressed hair. I just want some manageability with my coarse hair. The only drawback is that the on/off switch is right where my grip is, so it turns it off while am using it. It made it some work to use it.</li>
    <li> This hot comb works phenomenally well.&lt;br /&gt;As an African American, my hair is nappy and at times hard to pull a comb through successfully without pain. The flat iron came earlier than expected which gave me high hopes. I used it, and was satisfied with its various settings, it is customized for everyone and the nature of their hair. After finding my setting and using the comb, running a comb through it was easy, hands down. There were no tangles, nothing to stop the comb mid-way through my hair! I recommend using a heat resistant hair spray and applying that throughout your hair before using the comb. This will allow you to comb your hair without feeling the heat, as this product heats up very quickly. If you&#x27;re a person who wants straight roots...THIS PRODUCT IS FOR YOU! It straightens your roots easily, make sure you apply a heat resistant spray/product. This hot comb is very much worth its price, if not, worth MORE. It&#x27;s durable, I have 5 crazy kids, but this comb stands strong through thick and thin. It also has a stand so you can set it ANYWHERE without it burning anything. Make sure you don&#x27;t use this comb around children as it tends to get very hot depending on the settings. An dafter your done, set it in a cool area so it can cool off before you put it back in its case. This comb is amazing, and there&#x27;s really nothing more to it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this model but I have used this brand.  I have yet to open it and I use it for emergency press jobs! If it does not do what it should I will return to edit my review, otherwise...&amp;#34;press&amp;#34; on!</li>
    <li> I love this product, finally something that works on my course hair without damaging it in the meantime. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick-fix in between hair appts or just an at-home cheaper method of hair straightening.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> it was nice but this tool is hard to use because sometims it was too hot to touch the head skin but in conclusion it worth buying</li>
    <li> Worth it. The off button&#x27;s kinda in the way, but the heat is perfect. Watch the ears! Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Soooooo I am 31, natural with about a 3c/4a curl pattern (sorry I think it might now be taboo to classify your curl-pattern, but for the sake of the review, let&#x27;s keep it moving).&lt;br /&gt;I have been paying salons too frequently and waaaay too long because I can never get my edges to lie down like they can. This thing changed the game for me! $19 @ Target will save me hundreds of dollars at the salon. Now I can do what they do without having to wait for 2 hours to get out from under the stall-machine...errr I mean the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I purchased this..&lt;br /&gt;Pluses &amp; Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Gets SUPER hot even on it&#x27;s lowest setting, and this is coming from someone who has fuzzy edges that normally don&#x27;t lie down without salon attention.&lt;br /&gt;-Straightens edges like a pro&lt;br /&gt;-$20!!!! Are you kidding me??? For what this thing does I would pay way more! My Babyliss flat iron can&#x27;t maneuver like this bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;Caveats &amp; Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The on/off switch on the handle is a major design flaw... Like previous reviewers said, you will end up turning it off at first, but then you get used to it with practice (still totally worth $20, but Andis - you need to fix this!!!)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m afraid I am going to get addicted to this thing!!!!</li>
    <li> yes I do like it ..love the settings</li>
    <li> As noted by other reviewers, the only thing I found to dislike about this hot comb was the placement of the on/off switch...  It is almost impossible to use the comb without accidentally hitting it.  Other than that I absolutely LOVE this comb.  It does exactly what I needed a hot comb to do and does a very good job of it at that.  I have what I call &amp;#34;special needs&amp;#34; hair, different areas of my hair has different textures so it is hard to use a perm or something of that nature and achieve a consistent result on the whole head of hair.  Because I can vary the temperature of this comb higher or lower depending on the area of the hair I am pressing I can achieve a uniform look on the entire head of hair.  My natural hair (no chemicals) hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!!!</li>
    <li> The product works okay, but they clearly have the off button in the wrong place. Whoever designed this certainly doesn&#x27;t know how it is used because if they did, the off button would be elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have very kinky hair. Not only can I use this on my natural hair-I can turn down the temp and use it on my synthetic hair. Also your hair care products don&#x27;t stick or get burn onto the comb.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE ANDIS 38300 HEAT PRESS COMB. I HAVEN&#x27;T RELAXED MY HAIR IN 12 WEEKS; YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE THE NEW GROWTH. I APPLIED OIL TO MY HAIR AND I COMBED THROUGH USING MY ANDIS 38300 HOT COMB ON MY NEW GROWTH; MY THICK WAVY HAIR WAS COMPLETELY STRAIGHT! MY HAIR LOOKED LIKE I HAD JUST RELAXED IT. IF I CAN GET THROUGH THE SUMMER WITHOUT RELAXING MY HAIR; I MAY NEVER USE CHEMICAL ON MY HAIR EVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Light weight easy to hold, different level of setting options but i do feel that the on/off button should&#x27;ve been placed in another location. Due to the fact that you keep hitting the off button when in use.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair is really thick and course, which makes it hard tosyraighten with flat irons. This product works like a professional salon.</li>
    <li> Heats fast and works good.</li>
    <li> my favorite press comb that i had forever died on me &amp; it has been discontinued. so i tried lots of other brands but nothing worked on my natural thick curly hair. this press comb worked even better than my favorite one on my hair. makes my hair perfect for the days i want that straight hair look without the chemicals or getting a perm.</li>
    <li> I went to Target to pick it up after my stovetop broke (the little heat stove that you can buy w. a pressing comb broke) so the stovetop comb was now useless. Those stoves cost about $50 &amp; I hadn&#x27;t budgeted for that. My stovetop comb was probably 3 or 4 years old &amp; this electric comb worked BETTER than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African American , coarse hair... &amp; this pressing comb did the job beautifully &amp; efficiently.  I just got done using it &amp; ran to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have really tight curls, I&#x27;m African-American/Filipino. This does work on my hair, I&#x27;ve always needed my hair to have a hot comb. The only problem I would say I have with it is are when I am doing my hair my finger almost always hit&#x27;s the off button, it&#x27;s just a little annoying.</li>
    <li> I was greatly surprised by the excellent reviews on this comb.  I have always known this brand for good clippers so i was not sure about this product. I was used to always using a hot comb on the stove and when I purchased this electric one it worked great!  Plus I would have typically went with a different brand for an item like this but I had to try it because of all the positive reviews.  I have recommended this one for my mom now and at this price you can&#x27;t beat it!  Go for it!</li>
    <li> product is excellent is straightening hair. arrived in a timely manner. would recommend this product if you are tired of using the stove to heat your pressing comb.</li>
    <li> This is a great hot comb for the price I promise you. It has a nice grip too. I&#x27;m natural with super coily curly hair &amp; I need hot combs for my roots and edges because I just can&#x27;t get them with my flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have decided to stop relaxing me hair. I am an African American woman with thick and extremely kinky hair that is a little past my shoulder. My last relaxer was two months ago, so I have significant new growth. I decided to try a keratin treatment for straighening instead of the damaging relaxers, but I knew that the flat iron method could not cut it with the thickness and texture of my new growth. If I have to describe the results in one word it would be amazing. I followed the instructions for the keratin treatment to the letter, except for the flat ironing. I used the hot comb. It took a minute to get the hang of it, and the nape and the hairline areas are a bit tricky, but ultimately the results were as straight as a relaxer. Its been a week. I have washed my hair twice since the treatment. I have a little curl at the root still, but it is much more managable. I will add more in two months once I do the treatment again.</li>
    <li> this comb worked wonderful on my hair did my hair in half the time and my hair was silky and smooth i would recomend this comb to anyone especioally with afro american hair</li>
    <li> Great for sprucing up the new growth area.  Not good to do entire head.  Gets hot quick,  and temperature is adjustable.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my little girl.  She has naturally curly  hair.  This comb works miracles on her hair.  It used to take me 3 to 4 hors to comb her hair.  Now that I have the comb, it takes an hour to an hour and a haf to comb.  Just amazing.</li>
