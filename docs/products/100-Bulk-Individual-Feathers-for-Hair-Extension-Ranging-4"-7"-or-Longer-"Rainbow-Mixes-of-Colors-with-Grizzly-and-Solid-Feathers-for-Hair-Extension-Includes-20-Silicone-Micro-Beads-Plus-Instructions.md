      <li>This is an amazing collection of colors.</li>
      <li>This seller is honest in the description advertised.</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;re rolling the dice on what kind you&#x27;ll get.</li>
      <li>More orange would be nice.</li>

      <li>if you are a hair feather begginer buy from sexy sparkles, its quality and quantity, never buy synthetic feathers.</li>
      <li>I love the feathers in my hair.</li>

      <li>:}</li>
      <li>So, I got more like 400 feathers!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Excited to get my earrings made for all the girls in my wedding! :)</li>
      <li>She was so excited!</li>
      <li>of the feathers aren&#x27;t the prettiest color-wise, but other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with them!</li>
      <li>easy to put it.</li>
      <li>and they hold up just fine in my hair</li>
      <li>super easy to apply to hair.</li>
      <li>so fun!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s another bulk order of feathers that was far more satisfying and worth the money.</li>
      <li>Good mix of brights and neutrals, grizzly and solid.</li>
      <li>My first order was fantastic.</li>
      <li>i have purchased many single  feathers from sexy sparkles and am never dissapointed.</li>
      <li>also, if using heat on your hair, do condition it and put heat protectant on it as you would your own hair, im sure this plays a big role in being able to get a very long life from them too.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I thought they would be.</li>
      <li>wished there were more long grizzleys in the pack.</li>
      <li>the package you see is pretty much what you get, an assortment of varying lengths, colors and thicknesses.</li>
      <li>The only large feathers, and the most plentiful, were natural feathers which no one wanted.</li>
      <li>I know they didn&#x27;t coats much but</li>
      <li>they hold up very well.</li>
      <li>they do not fade a whole lot to begin with</li>
      <li>They are kind of tricky, they are not &amp;#34;individual&amp;#34; they are grouped together so in reality you are getting 100 small bundles of feathers that have like four or five glues together.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting larger feathers in fun colors.</li>
      <li>Other then that they were fine.</li>
      <li>Came quickly, beautiful quality, just  a few slightly damaged, but not many, totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Most the feathers were short, or just oddly shaped.</li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase though to make things clear</li>
      <li>and they last much  longer than 6 months.</li>
      <li>i usually keep one in up to 4 months and can still use it again another time and still own and use one single bunch i purchased a year ago.</li>
      <li>There were quite a lot of feathers but most were very small.</li>
      <li>color stay hair care will extend the color too, it is vibrant and will last alot longer if you properly care for them.</li>

<li> Received the package two days earlier than expected!&lt;br /&gt;The feathers and beads are in a plastic box that I can use to store them!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a little wider than expected, but I can always trim them if I want.</li>
<li> We bought these to use in our Crazy Hair Salon during our museum&#x27;s annual Dia de los Muertos/Day of the Dead celebration, and they are so cool!  </li>
<li> be scared away from the bad reviews, I think this is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
<li> Over all a waste.</li>
<li> Cut in strange places or twisted to were again no one wanted them.</li>
<li> I was quite disappointed when I received it as there were maybe 10 feathers that were acceptable for hair use.</li>

    <li> I received 82 feathers that were 2-3 inches long and the rest were between 4-4 1/2 inches. They were tattered and torn!</li>
    <li> Received the package two days earlier than expected!&lt;br /&gt;The feathers and beads are in a plastic box that I can use to store them!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a little wider than expected, but I can always trim them if I want. They are also bonded in 4&#x27;s, which are easy to cut apart with some effort! So, I got more like 400 feathers!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be scared away from the bad reviews, I think this is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the feathers aren&#x27;t the prettiest color-wise, but other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with them! Good mix of brights and neutrals, grizzly and solid. Will probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> 4 stars because I purchased twice. My first order was fantastic. Lots of useable feathers (longer than 3 inches). My second order was subpar. I was quite disappointed when I received it as there were maybe 10 feathers that were acceptable for hair use. It&#x27;s a very fair price for what you&#x27;re getting but you&#x27;re rolling the dice on what kind you&#x27;ll get. I will continue to purchase though to make things clear</li>
    <li> They are kind of tricky, they are not &amp;#34;individual&amp;#34; they are grouped together so in reality you are getting 100 small bundles of feathers that have like four or five glues together. I love the colors too.</li>
    <li> i love this bulk pack! i have purchased many single  feathers from sexy sparkles and am never dissapointed. its a great deal and i change them out all the time and have enough to do for my friends. they hold up very well. i straighten, blow dry and wash them and they have never fallen out, fried or gotten mangy. i usually keep one in up to 4 months and can still use it again another time and still own and use one single bunch i purchased a year ago. if you are a hair feather begginer buy from sexy sparkles, its quality and quantity, never buy synthetic feathers. the package you see is pretty much what you get, an assortment of varying lengths, colors and thicknesses. also, if using heat on your hair, do condition it and put heat protectant on it as you would your own hair, im sure this plays a big role in being able to get a very long life from them too. color stay hair care will extend the color too, it is vibrant and will last alot longer if you properly care for them. they do not fade a whole lot to begin with but i prefer to be safe so they will look great. :}</li>
    <li> Love to put this in my hair! so fun! I have even put some in my co-workers hair. She was so excited! easy to put it. and last a long time.</li>
    <li> For a non-salon owner, there are enough feathers for a lifetime.  The colors are equal to the picture.  They come in varying lengths, the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing collection of colors. They are beautiful and are excellent quallity. When I need more I will order again for sure!!!</li>
    <li> The feathers weren&#x27;t anything like the picture not even close. they look like someone&#x27;s left over craft feathers. Not happy at all, most of them are really short or broken, pretty rough looking. I know they didn&#x27;t coats much but all the reviews said: over all they were happy.  I got these for our salon doesn&#x27;t look like we will be using them.</li>
    <li> Most the feathers were short, or just oddly shaped. Other then that they were fine.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, beautiful quality, just  a few slightly damaged, but not many, totally worth it! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought they would be. Excited to get my earrings made for all the girls in my wedding! :)</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing theese feathers for almost 2 years.This seller is honest in the description advertised.I love the feathers in my hair.I shampoo my hair once or twice a week,blowdry,curling iron etc and they hold up just fine in my hair and they last much  longer than 6 months.I guess it depends on how you care for your hair as well as the feathers.I am very pleased and will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> We bought these to use in our Crazy Hair Salon during our museum&#x27;s annual Dia de los Muertos/Day of the Dead celebration, and they are so cool!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Tape damaged feathers.&lt;br /&gt;I wished there were more long grizzleys in the pack. Good color selection. More orange would be nice. I only had 3 orange ones</li>
    <li> Perfect. I&#x27;d buy again......If I ever run out!</li>
    <li> The feather themselves are beautiful but for the cost, I though I would be getting more than what I did. super easy to apply to hair. prob wouldn&#x27;t order them again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. There were quite a lot of feathers but most were very small. Only an inch or two. The only large feathers, and the most plentiful, were natural feathers which no one wanted. Over all a waste. I thought I was getting larger feathers in fun colors. There&#x27;s another bulk order of feathers that was far more satisfying and worth the money.

    <li> Feathers were a great variety of colors and sizes.</li>
