<li> I prefer the more subtle look</li>
<li> the only down side is that some of the smaller brushes are very dense, so it&#x27;s a bit harder to use to blend eyeshadow, but I&#x27;ve found other uses for them</li>
<li> and they are left to dry between paper towels</li>
<li> These brushes arent the greatest of brushes,but certainly not the worst.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got, fast shipping, nothing damaged or missing and no funky smells of harsh chemicals etc.&lt;br /&gt;First impressions.</li>
<li> My only complaint is I wish the blush brush were a little smaller.</li>
<li> there is always a black mark where the chemicals faded off , these brushes do not do this!  </li>
<li> you wont be sorry with these brushes.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m ordering more!  Really high quality, densely packed brushes with no fallout and seamless blending.  💗</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! They blend perfectly and smoothly. I looked at a lot of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Took a chance on ordering these brushes. Received in three days. Ladies if you&#x27;re looking for&lt;br /&gt;Firm, blending, non shredding brushes these are it. Great for the price!!!</li>
    <li> It is very good for the price.  Well made,  I still need to use all the brush to see how blendable they are</li>
    <li> Amazing product for depositing liquids and blending creams :) The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because it cannot be used for powders. The hairs in these brushes will pick up the powder brilliantly, but will not deposit it. But for liquids all over the face and contouring this product is the best! Better than most high priced brushes.</li>
    <li> you wont be sorry with these brushes. they are absolutley beautiful. they are so soft. i havent used them yet, but i have firmly rubbed the bristles and have lightly tugged at them and so far no shedding or none of the hairs have pulled out.  i am sure they will be awesome at applying my makeup. i got the silver ones and they, again are beautiful. i am so happy with my purchase. and the price couldnt be beat! and they came to my door in a flash which i totally was not expecting. i am a happy customer and i am sure you will be too.</li>
    <li> Love my brushes will be purchasing for my cousins (:</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but i have to share with everyone i am real and was looking for some cheap brush sets like sigma, i have to admit these are so bombbb they dont shed feel so light on the skin and leave it so smooth i have huge pores and it was always a problem and i can tell a difference the brushes make my face look. I am not getting paid to write this i just wanted to write this cause its my honest opinion. I wanna grab another set for my sis and friends just so they can feel the difference but that will wait. :) good luck and out of all the brushes go for these they are truly amazing for the price and delivery was in 2 days AMAZING!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Love theses brushes, Perfect for doing detail makeup. They are soft and allow you to apply makeup well. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooooo soft and for the price and how many brushes you get.. you really cant beat it with a stick. Ive been grabbing for these brushes more than all of my others lately.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes. Super sturdy, but soft at same time. They get the job done. great for concealers or foundation, even powders!! Just terrific!! great price for what you get</li>
    <li> Love these. I have tons of brushes and wanted to replace some old ones and these are great.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> Wow these brushes were here in a flash,2to 3 days top and I only had regular shipping. These brushes are great feels awesome to the skin I feel like these brushes defiantly gives you more for your money two thumbs up very satisfied customer. Looking to put in 2nd order for clients.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush quality for the price. Ia considering buying more. They are very comparable to sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes arent the greatest of brushes,but certainly not the worst. The eye brushes arent ver good at blending shades. Over all the brushes have a better use for liquid products. If youre looking for something cheap and decent this is it.</li>
    <li> The bristles on these brushes are nice and soft, and blend extremely well. My only complaint is I wish the blush brush were a little smaller. If I put blush on with this one I look like an extra from Dynasty. I prefer the more subtle look so I use a smaller brush I bought separately for blush. But for blending foundation and contouring, this set is great. There is no funky chemical smell and they don&#x27;t shed. And like I said, they&#x27;re so soft. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased May 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got, fast shipping, nothing damaged or missing and no funky smells of harsh chemicals etc.&lt;br /&gt;First impressions. The hairs seem very good quality, i just washed, no shedding. The part that holds the hair (shaft) seems cheap tin like feel, but as long as the hairs hold up im good.  Will do update once I&#x27;ve used couple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 8, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for my foundation etc.  these are excellent brushes, no streaks, even application and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Washing is easy, my 100$ sigma brush set every time i wash and they are left to dry between paper towels there is always a black mark where the chemicals faded off , these brushes do not do this!  5 stars all the way and I will be ordering more!  P.s. Zero shedding.</li>
    <li> Packages well love my new brushes.</li>
