      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>However, this is really great stuff.</li>
      <li>none of them do a particularly great job.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s time consuming and although a great indulgence my schedule has me at the mercy of electrics.</li>
      <li>and my face feels great after.</li>
      <li>Helps produce a great, close shave.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product!  </li>

      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s fair to say that when it comes to shaving I&#x27;m a bit obsessive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fair to say that the performance of my razors have improved a good 50% and again using the Lab Series pre shave</li>

      <li>I probably could have given this a five, but I try to reserve that for truly exceptional items.  </li>
      <li>I received the Lab Series Solution and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>superb product that does exactly what it promises to do.</li>
      <li>I figured that if that was good, then perhaps a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; option would be better.</li>
      <li>Gives you a nice close shave</li>
      <li>It is fragrance free and very effective.</li>
      <li>I  have already ordered more.</li>
      <li>The smell seems OK.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used William&#x27;s and this is much better because it does not get gummy or sticky as you&#x27;re</li>
      <li>We were so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Like magic skin tightens and hairs poke with out.</li>
      <li>It costs more than Williams Lectric Shave or others, but Lab Series helps give me a shave like I had used a razor.</li>
      <li>The Afta is more of a gel, and so, stays put until I apply it to my face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having tried many electric pre shaves</li>
      <li>The more important thing for me, it reduce the irritation on my skin after the shave.</li>
      <li>Economical and smells nice without clogging the shaver.  </li>
      <li>Also like that the bottle is compact, since I travel and it easily fits into my shave kit.</li>
      <li>The alcohol is strong.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong although it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hands down the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Afta until I can find something with no scent/a pleasant scent that&#x27;s more of a gel.</li>
      <li>This solution does the trick, plus has some oil added to smooth out the razor blades.</li>
      <li>Feels comfortable.    </li>
      <li>This is shaving using a DE (double edge razor blade) or straight razor - both of which provide an excellent barber shop quality</li>
      <li>I use a Braun electric shaver and it results in a clean and smooth finish.</li>
      <li>I am surprised and very pleased with the comfort and closeness attained by using Lab Series Electric Shave Solution before shaving, additionally it is fragrance free and leaves no residue on your face or shaver.</li>
      <li>* Provides a significantly closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anything to get me the closest shave without using a manual blade is worth my time!</li>
      <li>First time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure it made a difference</li>
      <li>Really stands up your beard and enables my Braun shaver to get as close as many blades.</li>
      <li>;( I have tried every brand of pre-shave both liquid and dry (powder stick) and nothing is as good as this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have a 7 series Braun razor and its great, but wanted a little closer shave and maybe a bit of skin conditioner as I find shaving dries my face.</li>
      <li>Considering that between shipping and the Lab Series product cost &amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34; at 1/6 the cost is a far better deal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth</li>
      <li>But if you have the right electric shaver and THIS pre shave</li>
      <li>The extra cost is worth the better results.....</li>
      <li>Save time shaving and get a better longer lasting shave!  </li>
      <li>and I can see I will get 3 months or more out of a bottle so overall</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of LS per shave, so a bottle will last for a couple of months or more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice little luxury, which when I use as the instructions state get me a closer shave</li>
      <li>you can come VERY close.</li>
      <li>and you use twice as much as LAB.</li>
      <li>you use an electric shaver you absolutely need this.</li>
      <li>&gt; - it really works&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt; - it really really works&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting a really close shave when I use this product.</li>
      <li>br /&gt; - electric shaver glides over the skin even better than wet</li>
      <li>This lift makes it much easier for an electric to mow down even the most stubborn whiskers and leave as close to a blade shave</li>
      <li>I became a fan of old school wet shaving many years ago.</li>
      <li>do a decent job on my cheeks, the neck area is never blade close - and as I&#x27;m a head shaver</li>
      <li>The price seems high to me</li>
      <li>Highly recommend  and wish I had found this stuff years ago.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>A single bottle will last me 3 months or more.</li>
      <li>About the only thing that could be considered a positive is the lack of smell.</li>
      <li>but this does last a while as you don&#x27;t need much for a shave.</li>
      <li>I have been using Lectric Shave for nearly two years.  </li>
      <li>You have to apply it many times because its so thin.</li>
      <li>It seems to provide a good close shave when used with my 10-year-old Braun razor, but it&#x27;s very difficult to apply.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Even though it is thin, it works well. You have to apply it many times because its so thin. The price seems high to me but I&#x27;m use to buying Afta. The smell seems OK. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Pro:  Unscented.  Feels comfortable.    Con:  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting a really close shave when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I probably could have given this a five, but I try to reserve that for truly exceptional items.  Really stands up your beard and enables my Braun shaver to get as close as many blades.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every day, and it was no longer carried where we usually bought it.  We were so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Helps produce a great, close shave.  Leaves no odor, so it does not conflict with aftershave.  Does not gum up.  I&#x27;ve used William&#x27;s and this is much better because it does not get gummy or sticky as you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Rather expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> My previous experience with electric pre-shave lotion had been limited to Afta, which works well, but I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of. I figured that if that was good, then perhaps a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; option would be better. Well...yes and no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lab Series shave solution is a very thin, sort of oily liquid. It seems to provide a good close shave when used with my 10-year-old Braun razor, but it&#x27;s very difficult to apply. It runs between my fingers when I attempt to put some in my hand, meaning that I have to wipe about half of it off the backs of my hands to get it all. The Afta is more of a gel, and so, stays put until I apply it to my face. Chalk up one for Afta. The Lab Series, however, does not seem to leave any noticeable smell, which is a big plus over the Afta, whose odor I&#x27;m not a huge fan of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Afta until I can find something with no scent/a pleasant scent that&#x27;s more of a gel.</li>
    <li> Great product. A few shakes into your hand, rub together and apply to face and neck. Like magic skin tightens and hairs poke with out. Ingrown hair and razor burn disappeared in a week of use. Highly recommend  and wish I had found this stuff years ago.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I have been using Lectric Shave for nearly two years.  After talking with a friend this product was recommended and what a difference!  Save time shaving and get a better longer lasting shave!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I received the Lab Series Solution and I am very pleased with the product.It is fragrance free and very effective.I use a Braun electric shaver and it results in a clean and smooth finish.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second bottle of Lab Series. It costs more than Williams Lectric Shave or others, but Lab Series helps give me a shave like I had used a razor. I shave with a Braun 7 series electric razor. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of LS per shave, so a bottle will last for a couple of months or more. Also like that the bottle is compact, since I travel and it easily fits into my shave kit. The extra cost is worth the better results.....</li>
    <li> The more important thing for me, it reduce the irritation on my skin after the shave.</li>
    <li> Works great! No water, no clean up and close shave.</li>
    <li> Best pre-shave product I&#x27;ve used since Williams stopped making Tenderface.  Poorly engineered bottle is messy and wastes costly product.</li>
    <li> I gave information on this order earlier&lt;br /&gt;  Richard miller</li>
    <li> This product is clearly no better than Williams &amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34;. Considering that between shipping and the Lab Series product cost &amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34; at 1/6 the cost is a far better deal. In other words, I was expecting a Cadillac and got less than an old VW bug.</li>
    <li> The best pre electric shave I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Gives you a nice close shave but sadly it doesn&#x27;t&#x27;t smell at all like Aramis after shave or cologne!</li>
    <li> was a bit skeptic that it would help.  but now use every day.  works well  I  have already ordered more.</li>
    <li> A little dab will do you.  Economical and smells nice without clogging the shaver.  Tried other pre electric but this is the best</li>
    <li> This is the best pre-electric lotion I have found. If you shave with an electric razor, you need something to set up your bears. This solution does the trick, plus has some oil added to smooth out the razor blades. A single bottle will last me 3 months or more. I used to buy it from the big stores in the mall, but I got tired of being ignored by the fragrance ladies. I only buy this from Amazon now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s spendy and in truth, does not do anything better than less expensive alternative pre-shaves (i.e. Williams Lectric Shave). I&#x27;ve used it now for over a month with no better results than shaving dry (no pre-shave whatsoever) or using another pre-shave. About the only thing that could be considered a positive is the lack of smell. Other than that - don&#x27;t waste your money. It does NOT raise your beard and make it easier for the cutters to shave. Anyone who makes that claim is deceiving himself.</li>
    <li> This product does what is intended very well and has only a faint scent.  Best pre-shave I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used Lectric Shave for years and I find I have been missing something. When you put Letric on your face the alcohol takes your breath away and you use twice as much as LAB. Lab takes just a few drops and almost no smell. As log as I can get it i will buy.  Try it and you will buy it....</li>
    <li> - part of me thought that this was just expensive alcohol mixed with a few drops of oil, but whatever it is....&lt;br /&gt; - it really works&lt;br /&gt; - it really really works&lt;br /&gt; - have used it every day now for about three weeks and have not thought about wet shaving&lt;br /&gt; - have a wet and dry electric (Philips) shaver but dry shaving with this solution gives the best results&lt;br /&gt; - just splash a few drops on like aftershave and you are all set, prepares the skin perfectly&lt;br /&gt; - electric shaver glides over the skin even better than wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt; - three weeks and can hardly see that the level in the bottle has dropped at all from full.&lt;br /&gt; - I guess a bottle will last 6 to 12 months.</li>
    <li> Liked that it&#x27;s fragrance free and does a great job!</li>
    <li> This does make shaving easier. First time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure it made a difference but now I feel like I do get a slightly closer shave. Anything to get me the closest shave without using a manual blade is worth my time! The scent is strong although it doesn&#x27;t linger. The alcohol is strong. Every time I put this on the my face I feel like I can&#x27;t breath for a couple seconds. This isn&#x27;t enough to drive me away from the benefits of this item. You should try it. The price and small size may trick you into thinking this is a bad deal but this does last a while as you don&#x27;t need much for a shave.</li>
    <li> I think anyone who shaves knows that you can&#x27;t match the closeness of a conventional blade shave. But if you have the right electric shaver and THIS pre shave you can come VERY close. I am surprised and very pleased with the comfort and closeness attained by using Lab Series Electric Shave Solution before shaving, additionally it is fragrance free and leaves no residue on your face or shaver. I hate smelling like I&#x27;ve been marinated in cheap garish after shave lotion. (Williams Lectric Shave ;( I have tried every brand of pre-shave both liquid and dry (powder stick) and nothing is as good as this stuff. It&#x27;s not cheap but don&#x27;t that scare you away. It&#x27;s well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;If you use an electric shaver you absolutely need this. It&#x27;s hands down the best. If you try it, I bet you&#x27;ll agree.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical making this purchase as the price for the amount you get is quite high.  However, this is really great stuff. I tried the Williams electric shave and was horrible disappointed as it smells like the 1970s and my dad.  And, the shave wasn&#x27;t any closer than when I shaved dry, which is 99% of the time. I have a 7 series Braun razor and its great, but wanted a little closer shave and maybe a bit of skin conditioner as I find shaving dries my face. The Lab series  electric shave lotion does just that. It&#x27;s a nice little luxury, which when I use as the instructions state get me a closer shave and my face feels great after. No oppressive horrible scent. What scent there is, is quite pleasant and not offensive at all. 5 little drops spread over my face and my rather thick stubble is ready to shave after a Quick air dry. I cannot be happier with this product. And as a side note. I&#x27;ve used it everyday and I can see I will get 3 months or more out of a bottle so overall the price is not an issue when I consider the amount of uses I will get out of a bottle. I will definitely buy again. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I suppose it&#x27;s fair to say that when it comes to shaving I&#x27;m a bit obsessive. I became a fan of old school wet shaving many years ago. This is shaving using a DE (double edge razor blade) or straight razor - both of which provide an excellent barber shop quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s time consuming and although a great indulgence my schedule has me at the mercy of electrics. I use a Braun 790cc and a Norelco Sensor 3D 1250 and a Panasonic  ES8249S Nanotech 4-Blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All do a decent job on my cheeks, the neck area is never blade close - and as I&#x27;m a head shaver none of them do a particularly great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried many electric pre shaves I have found them all marginal at best. When reading the glowing reviews of the Lab Series electric pre shave I figured, why not and ordered a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply stated - I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product coats even the shortest, hard to shave down hairs and makes them stand up as opposed to laying flat. You feel this effect immediate with your hand as you apply it. This lift makes it much easier for an electric to mow down even the most stubborn whiskers and leave as close to a blade shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from any electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fewer passes needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t clog razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Evaporates Quickly - no waiting time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Provides a significantly closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fair to say that the performance of my razors have improved a good 50% and again using the Lab Series pre shave get&#x27;s you as close to a blade shave as you&#x27;re going to get from an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A superb product that does exactly what it promises to do.</li>
