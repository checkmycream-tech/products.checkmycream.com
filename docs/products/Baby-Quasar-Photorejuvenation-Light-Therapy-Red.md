### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>THANK GOD for their AWESOME return policy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>GOOD LUCK!!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update 12/19/2012:  Still very happy with my purchase!.  </li>
      <li>Looks like I&#x27;ll be taking advantage of their wonderful return policy.</li>
      <li>It may be an excellent product, it may be the best ever!</li>
      <li>He got a bunch of people to write great reviews online</li>
      <li>and I was so happy with the service I received from the company.    </li>
      <li>Any lines or creases there are greatly improved with use about 2 times a week for about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>[...]  Think about it people...if this product is SOOOOOOO GREAT then it would be flying off the shelves and all the \\&quot;baby boomers\\&quot; would be taking out loans to purchase it.  </li>
      <li>I have been receiving many compliments on my skin and how \\&quot;young\\&quot; I look!!  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and you will get results !&lt;</li>
      <li>I got this after reading so many great reviews.  </li>
      <li>Because I had read so many great reviews on amazon, I decided to stick with it in hopes that I, too, would see some improvement at the end of 2-3 months.  </li>
      <li>I am giving this amazing product 4 stars, as I have not yet used it for the 6 weeks as recommended, so</li>
      <li>Then the skin on my face is tightening up nicely.  </li>
      <li>nice one.  </li>
      <li>She is using it and loving it too.</li>
      <li>Well, I honestly can&#x27;t see ANY difference in my wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I have found that I love using it because it feels good on my skin once it warms up.</li>
      <li>Remember to always use on a clean face, let the machine warm up before you start to use it, and be consistant!.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the baby quasar &amp; believe it is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>it looks and sounds to good to be true</li>
      <li>So, i&#x27;ve paid almost $400 and now i have to spend more money on returning it and even after that i will have no insurance that the defective product will be replaced.</li>
      <li>This is nothing more savvy marketing by the CEO.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I think I have noticed most on my hands.  </li>
      <li>This is so much better than taking medication for an injury.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to get it to stay on for more than eight minutes.</li>
      <li>If you decide to splurge on the Baby Q, and commit to using it religiously, I am confident you will notice results.</li>
      <li>I would have been better off purchasing a flashlight and putting that over my face instead.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had good results and feel it was worth my money.  </li>
      <li>My fiance also commented on how good my skin looked and he admitted this tool must really be working (he would not ever tell me it was working</li>
      <li>This product actually helps and I am delighted!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 36, and have fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Being in my 40&#x27;s, the skin around my eyes has quite the web of fine lines.</li>
      <li>and I do not see any improvement to my fine lines around my eyes(I am 40),, pore size, skin texture, rosacea with spider veins or</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a beauty device that will even out your skin tone, minimize fine lines and wrinkles then consider the baby quasar.  </li>
      <li>My mother-in-law also commented on what a huge difference she saw in my skin.</li>
      <li>There are detailed instructions in the box.  </li>
      <li>I was amazed at how radiant, smooth and even-toned my skin looked.</li>
      <li>Can Smooth or Zap</li>
      <li>I jiggled the cord and the light flashed, so</li>
      <li>manufacturer of the quasar light therapy devices has fantastic customer service.  </li>
      <li>and it works for another minute, then i let it cool again...</li>
      <li>Ibought this from Nordstrom because I was sceptical (though VERY hopeful) and wanted to be sure I could return it hassle-free.</li>
      <li>Then i let it cool again</li>
      <li>Because they&#x27;re pretty fine, I did expect to see SOME improvement based on what I&#x27;ve read on the internet.  </li>
      <li>This started happening since the very first use.</li>
      <li>I have fair, slightly dry skin</li>
      <li>I phoned their customer service and the person on the phone was kind of short and assertive with me.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>And for a busy person who doesn&#x27;t have time for lots of non-work related appointments, this home device is a great alternative.</li>
      <li>So I am surprised and pleased this seems to be working as intended.  </li>
      <li>The individual I interacted with over the phone was very knowledgable and had good bedside manner so to speak.</li>
      <li>but for sure, it does look different.  </li>
      <li>I get a monthly facials and after my most recent one I used the Baby Q in healing mode.</li>
      <li>... my face overall looks better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Do not use on my whole face so I cannot weigh in on that!</li>
      <li>The old cords have some kind of problem with them apparently.  </li>
      <li>Buy if you want to buy it just make sure you can return it back.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much Baby Quasar!</li>
      <li>But something must have happened as my face appears brighter, smoother, more even toned and younger in just two weeks.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>it REALLY works on my forehead!</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this product would help reduce the wrinkles and it certainly appears to be working!</li>
      <li>I have fine lines around the eyes, and I also want to see if it helps with some acne flareups and general appearance of my skin and pores.</li>
      <li>It is easy enough to do while watching tv.  </li>
      <li>Blue one works fine.</li>
      <li>Also, I can finally eat ice cream without having a break-out, so it seems the light must zap acne causing</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m going to really concentrate on my neck area and start to do once a week maintenance on my face.</li>
      <li>I really recommend that you do your homework.  </li>
      <li>I find that the Baby Q shortens the healing time of breakouts and has really improved my hyperpigmentation.</li>
      <li>So, this does work, but you really do have to spend the time it takes.  </li>
      <li>Today, four days after my facial and two Baby Q treatments later, my skin looks radiant, smooth and free of breakouts or dryness.</li>
      <li>I have been using the baby quasar for over 1 month now and have seen very favorable results.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate companies that treat their customers well.</li>
      <li>Buti do believe because you&#x27;ve spend so much money on it and because you&#x27;re on this quest for youth...</li>
      <li>I would have been very upset</li>
      <li>and I can honestly tell you that this piece of junk is waste of  your money and time.  </li>
      <li>Luckily my postal insurance receipt is 3 days later ,,and my first e-mail to them was a week.  </li>
      <li>still am waiting for the rest as I sent the item back in the original box 3 days after I received it.</li>
      <li>After several treatments on the green light \\&quot;healing\\&quot; setting, I&#x27;m now able to use the arm again in a fully, functioning capacity.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed smoother, more supple skin around my eyes a few hours after treatment.</li>
      <li>and I can notice that the normally saggy skin at the front of my neck is tighter.  </li>
      <li>My eyes were beginning to develop a hooded look but the skin has perked right back up.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had this 3 days, but I noticed an instant improvement in my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>but Will the Results Hit Home?\\&quot; from the New York Times.  </li>
      <li>my power supply was new and i should not have had any problems with it.</li>
      <li>What annoys the most is that they weren&#x27;t even remotely apologetic and handled it like a regularly occurring thing.  </li>
      <li>We all want to look younger, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any magic bullet, and this certainly is not it.  </li>
      <li>I never was able to see if there was much of a difference long term because the first stopped working after a few months and the second never worked.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not exactly taking ten years off, but hey, I&#x27;ll be happy with a few years!  </li>
      <li>I bought my baby quasar directly from the manufacturer so it included a 5 yr warranty.  </li>
      <li>Please do not waste your money.  </li>
      <li>I am pleasantly surprised by the results, but I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement yet with pore size.</li>
      <li>The marionette lines near my nose &amp;  mouth have vanished.  </li>
      <li>It is very well made and compact enough to take on a trip.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using since early may, 3 times a week.  </li>
      <li>The pain is almost completely gone.  </li>
      <li>The skin above my eyes really responded to the quasar.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Am in my late 50&#x27;s.  I have been using this for a few weeks and it really seems to work.  The change, so far, is more subtle than dramatic.  I had a small bump next to my nose my Dr. wouldn&#x27;t even touch and it seems to have healed it, it is much smaller now (I used the green light on the bump next to my nose after the regular amber treatment).  There are detailed instructions in the box.  It is easy enough to do while watching tv.  I think I have noticed most on my hands.  It doesn&#x27;t say to use it on your hands but I thought I would try and I do see an improvement.  So I am surprised and pleased this seems to be working as intended.  It is very well made and compact enough to take on a trip.</li>
    <li> I tried two of these.I never was able to see if there was much of a difference long term because the first stopped working after a few months and the second never worked.The lights would come on in a random pattern on both of them,or not at all.I noticed a different power supply on the second one that I sent back.  22nd St. fusion was horrible .They kept making excuses (moved,lost my package ,what was the return address on package,ect)When I contacted Amazon they finally credited me all but 75.00.I still am waiting for the rest as I sent the item back in the original box 3 days after I received it.I guess because they couldnt find it and waited over 30 days they think they will get away with this.Luckily my postal insurance receipt is 3 days later ,,and my first e-mail to them was a week.  I noticed a very small improvement in my skin and would have continued to use to see if it got even better,but the product is poorly made.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about the prospects of the Baby Quasar-Red Lt, but after using this device I started to see a DEEPENING of what was once very subtle crow&#x27;s feet.  \\&quot;It must be my imagination\\&quot; or \\&quot;perhaps, it gets worse before it gets better\\&quot; I thought.  Because I had read so many great reviews on amazon, I decided to stick with it in hopes that I, too, would see some improvement at the end of 2-3 months.  Instead, it AGED MY APPEARANCE and it is NOW TOO LATE FOR A REFUND.  I&#x27;m out $368.90 and now look older than I did because I allowed my optimism to temporarily over ride my caution and common sense!</li>
    <li> I bought this for naso-labial folds but also tried it on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did improve some small lines around my mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it REALLY works on my forehead! Any lines or creases there are greatly improved with use about 2 times a week for about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use on my whole face so I cannot weigh in on that!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on another discount website and after researching and reading reviews, ended up at Amazon because it was the lowest price. I was really hoping this product would help reduce the wrinkles and it certainly appears to be working! I have fair, slightly dry skin and I smoke. Being in my 40&#x27;s, the skin around my eyes has quite the web of fine lines. This product actually helps and I am delighted! It does take time to use, about 30 minutes each treatment. I&#x27;ve noticed smoother, more supple skin around my eyes a few hours after treatment. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last a week, so I try to use it every 3 days. I&#x27;ve tried it on stretch marks and lose skin from pregnancy, I&#x27;m not sure anything but surgery will help that, but the skin does seem tighter. I think it&#x27;s worth the money. One thing about the reseller Shopwars (through Amazon), they sent an email requesting feedback. In the email is a clickhere link saying it will take you to Amazon to leave feedback, it actually submitted a 5 star rating for me that I can&#x27;t remove or access to add this feedback to. I would have been very upset had I not wanted to leave 4 or 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Please save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I got this after reading so many great reviews.  This really makes you think about the genuineness of these reviews and what&#x27;s really going on behind the scenes.  I always said that \\&quot;if it looks and sounds to good to be true then it probably is\\&quot;. But as always, I usually like to give things a chance and not be so judgmental.  Because.................. it looks like the expensive ones used in professional skin care spas (those really work!!!!!) and because of its cost (\\&quot;it&#x27;s expensive so it has to work\\&quot;), I purchased this from Nordstrom.  THANK GOD for their AWESOME return policy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Big mistake.  It doesn&#x27;t produce any results.  I would have been better off purchasing a flashlight and putting that over my face instead.  I used this for 3 months continuously and I&#x27;m sorry to say that I noticed absolutely NO CHANGE.....NO RESULTS....NO NOTHING.  Except wasting my time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I really recommend that you do your homework.  Google the article \\&quot;You Can Smooth or Zap but Will the Results Hit Home?\\&quot; from the New York Times.  This will definitely OPEN your eyes up.  Here&#x27;s a link unless it gets taken down- [...]  Think about it people...if this product is SOOOOOOO GREAT then it would be flying off the shelves and all the \\&quot;baby boomers\\&quot; would be taking out loans to purchase it.  This is nothing more savvy marketing by the CEO.  He got a bunch of people to write great reviews online and then what do you know..... Whalah......people start getting brainwashed and thinking it works.  Same type of marketing used with the creme de la mer product.  I really hate to call people suckers but they are.  People will believe anything.  I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician who works in a medical spa and I can honestly tell you that this piece of junk is waste of  your money and time.  I&#x27;m sorry to say that I am extremely skeptical of anyone who says it works for them.  Sorry....don&#x27;t believe you.  Buti do believe because you&#x27;ve spend so much money on it and because you&#x27;re on this quest for youth...that you&#x27;ve convinced yourself it works.  Almost like the self fulfilling prophecy.  Buy if you want to buy it just make sure you can return it back.  GOOD LUCK!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the BQ Red faithfully and as directed every other day for just over three months now.  I&#x27;m 36, and have fine lines around my eyes.  Because they&#x27;re pretty fine, I did expect to see SOME improvement based on what I&#x27;ve read on the internet.  Well, I honestly can&#x27;t see ANY difference in my wrinkles.  I gave it three stars because it has seemed to help a little with some redness I have around my mouth.  But just a little.  I&#x27;m going to continue using it (for a while anyway), and if I notice any changes, I&#x27;ll update.  Update 7/3/12:  I stopped using this because although it did seem to help with redness, I&#x27;ve started to notice a darkening of some of my pigmented areas.  I can even see freckles starting to become faintly visible on my bottom eye-lids.  The only time I&#x27;ve seen that happen was when I spent a little time in Arizona. I haven&#x27;t been outside, and I live in a non-sunny region, so the only thing I can figure is that the BQ is influencing my coloring.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product delivers results or not for i haven&#x27;t got a chance to evaluate it, it constantly shuts down after working for only a few min (the unit goes off leaving only 6 very dimly lit bulbs and then after a while they die too). This started happening since the very first use. If i let it sit for a few min unplugged it cools down and works for one or two minutes and shuts down again. Then i let it cool again and it works for another minute, then i let it cool again... etc. etc. You&#x27;re getting the picture. I phoned their customer service and the person on the phone was kind of short and assertive with me. She immediately said that they were going to send me a new power supply, but later told me that it looked like  my power supply was new and i should not have had any problems with it. Um.. ooook. After describing the problem over and over to her, she said i had to send it for \\&quot;an evaluation\\&quot; and they would decide if (IF!!!!) it had to be replaced. So, i&#x27;ve paid almost $400 and now i have to spend more money on returning it and even after that i will have no insurance that the defective product will be replaced. nice one.  I&#x27;ll update later. What annoys the most is that they weren&#x27;t even remotely apologetic and handled it like a regularly occurring thing.  I don&#x27;t know much about this Silver Bay company (which supposedly makes baby quasar), but it seems to me that selling low quality cheaply made products at unreasonably inflated prices is usually a sign of here-today-gone-tomorrow scamming businesses.</li>
    <li> Cannot quite put my finger on it, but ... my face overall looks better.  I have used it now for 2 week, every second day in the first week and for 3 treatments in the second week.  From the second time I used Baby Quasar the overall appearance of my face improved.  I cannot say with certainty that my pores are visibly smaller (I did not have enlarged pores anyway).  The redness I had for about a month before I started using Baby Qasar was somewhat reduced - or it was gone but then came back after a exhausting spin class.  I cannot say with certainty that the fine lines have disappeared or that they are visibly reduced, or that a small cluster of broken capilaries on my left cheeck has disappeared all together. But something must have happened as my face appears brighter, smoother, more even toned and younger in just two weeks.  Strange ...  I also used it on my neck and I can notice that the normally saggy skin at the front of my neck is tighter.  I am giving this amazing product 4 stars, as I have not yet used it for the 6 weeks as recommended, so I want to see if the results keep improving.</li>
    <li> It may be an excellent product, it may be the best ever! BUT! I have yet to get it to stay on for more than eight minutes. Bio-Tech did send a replacement power cord, but that didn&#x27;t fix the problem. So, I contacted Bio-Tech again. Now I have to pay to ship it back to them and they will either try to fix it or replace it. I feel like I got taken on this one.Who knows when I will ever get to use it and at the price I paid. I&#x27;m a little ticked off.  I would say if you want to try it,  get if from the store, do not order it online!</li>
    <li> If I hadn&#x27;t seen it myself, I wouldn&#x27;t believe it.  I decided to test the results by using it on just one hand, in addition to my face.  I knew the changes in my face would be slow enough that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to remember what I looked like before.  Lo and behold, literally after about 3 uses, a couple or a few days apart each time, the hand I was using it on started looking different.  Perhaps it was already less ragged looking, since it&#x27;s my less dominant hand?  I don&#x27;t know, but for sure, it does look different.  It just looks like the skin is tighter, less used, more smooth...but somewhat dramatic.    Unfortunately, after less than a month of owning it, today when I turned it on, I was using it for about 30 seconds when I heard a pop noise, and half the lights stopped working, on one whole side.  This is a huge bummer, because I&#x27;ve seen from other reviewers that they are not good to work with with returns or repairs.  Tomorrow I will call, I&#x27;m expected a hassle, but I hope it&#x27;s not.  I&#x27;ll follow up with a recap once I see how they handle it.    If it wasn&#x27;t for it breaking, I would rate this item a 5.  Unfortunately, I have to rate it very low, because if I can&#x27;t use it since it&#x27;s broken, it doesn&#x27;t matter how effective it is when it does work. :-(</li>
    <li> I bought this Baby Quasar Red in hopes it would help my horrible discoloration I have on my face from years of laying out in the sun. I am almost 27 and have had this bad hyper pigmentation on my forehead, cheeks and upper lip for 7 years. I have spent literally thousands of dollars on products trying to lighten the discoloration on my face but nothing helped much. After about a month of using the baby quasar every other day I can notice quite a big difference in my discoloration. It has truly become lighter and started to even totally disappear in some spots. My fiance also commented on how good my skin looked and he admitted this tool must really be working (he would not ever tell me it was working if it was not-I had purchased the FaceMaster by Suzanne Sommers &amp; he told me it did nothing for the discoloration (but it did help to firm and tighten my skin). My mother-in-law also commented on what a huge difference she saw in my skin. I am totally convinced that after using this continually it will in time totally restore my face to its pre sun-damaged state. Thank you so much Baby Quasar! No words could compare to the thankfulness I have in my heart for this product that is helping to restore my face!</li>
    <li> So, this does work, but you really do have to spend the time it takes.  I almost completely erased my forehead wrinkles with this thing, but it is so hard to keep up with treatments, so they do come back when you stop.  You have to be patient to see results as well...  It can take up to three months to see anything.  It&#x27;s hard to keep going when you&#x27;ve been doing something for 90 days with no results!  Just keep it up.  I decided to use this on the highest setting the whole time because I&#x27;m so impatient and I didn&#x27;t have any bad reaction and I did see results faster.    After a year, my unit stopped working.  I jiggled the cord and the light flashed, so I figured it was the cord.  I called the 1-800 number for the company and in less than a minute, she had taken down my name and was sending me a new cord for free.  The old cords have some kind of problem with them apparently.  There was no hassle with this and I was so happy with the service I received from the company.    I would buy this with confidence.  Just know that it takes total commitment to see results and you have to keep doing it to maintain them.  I&#x27;ve been without my unit for awhile now and the wrinkles are back, but don&#x27;t look any worse than before.  :)</li>
    <li> Ibought this from Nordstrom because I was sceptical (though VERY hopeful) and wanted to be sure I could return it hassle-free. Looks like I&#x27;ll be taking advantage of their wonderful return policy. :-(&lt;br /&gt;I used this thing exactly as directed for a full six weeks and I do not see any improvement to my fine lines around my eyes(I am 40),, pore size, skin texture, rosacea with spider veins or my skin&#x27;s elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;This was a complete waste of time and money, for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks now. I was concerned that I&#x27;d hate using it because of the length of time each treatment takes. I have found that I love using it because it feels good on my skin once it warms up. I use it in the morning as I get up two hours before I have to leave for work (I&#x27;m slow in the morning and hate rushing). I am 25 and have had rosacea for about 5 years now. I find that the Baby Q shortens the healing time of breakouts and has really improved my hyperpigmentation. I get a monthly facials and after my most recent one I used the Baby Q in healing mode. I had quite a few extractions done and my skin was irritated. After using the Baby Q my skin calmed down and the irritated blemishes shrank. Today, four days after my facial and two Baby Q treatments later, my skin looks radiant, smooth and free of breakouts or dryness. Used as part of a proper skin care regimen, the Baby Q can work miracles. Finally, I went out with friends this weekend and had some pictures taken of me. When I uploaded them from my DSLR camera and looked at them on my computer I was amazed at how radiant, smooth and even-toned my skin looked. If you decide to splurge on the Baby Q, and commit to using it religiously, I am confident you will notice results. I cannot speak to its anti-aging properties as I do not have such concerns yet, but I can definitely say it will help with hyperpigmentation, sensitivity, pore size and overall tone and texture of the skin.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for use on my hand for pain management after a surgery. I found the device helpful and used it 1-2x per week. Unfortunately the device stopped working after a little more than 4 months after purchase. It&#x27;s too expensive to fail this quickly. While it fail quickly, it was not quick enough to fall within Amazon&#x27;s window. I guess it is now time to wrestle with the mfr&#x27;s warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer of the quasar light therapy devices has fantastic customer service.  The individual I interacted with over the phone was very knowledgable and had good bedside manner so to speak. They replaced my defective unit promptly and without any complications.  I really appreciate companies that treat their customers well.</li>
    <li> I started by using this on tendonitis that stretches from my elbow to my fingertips.  The results were dramatic.  After several treatments on the green light \\&quot;healing\\&quot; setting, I&#x27;m now able to use the arm again in a fully, functioning capacity.  The pain is almost completely gone.  This is so much better than taking medication for an injury.  I tried it on an arthritic knee and yes, it&#x27;s helped keep the inflammation down there, too.  I&#x27;ve also started using Baby Quasar on my spider veins and have already noticed some improvement.  Then the skin on my face is tightening up nicely.  It&#x27;s not exactly taking ten years off, but hey, I&#x27;ll be happy with a few years!  And, I&#x27;ve only gotten started with this, so we&#x27;ll see what happens in a month or so.  Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve had good results and feel it was worth my money.  And for a busy person who doesn&#x27;t have time for lots of non-work related appointments, this home device is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> This is a scam, I&#x27;ve been doing this everyday since I recieved it and nothing. No good results. Wrinkles are still there. Save your money..people have lied about this product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this one and the blue one and the blue is still going and this one quit after just a few uses. Returned to get a new one and instead they refunded me part of my purchase minus a $50 restocking fee. Wouldnt buy this one again. Blue one works fine.</li>
    <li> After following instructions, doing it every day for decreasing wrinkles, tightening skin, I found the BABY QUASAR to be ineffective in this regard. I wish that I had sent it back and got my money back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37 and this was actually purchased through airline reward points, but I actually think it is worth the $250 price tag. I have fine lines around the eyes, and I also want to see if it helps with some acne flareups and general appearance of my skin and pores. I&#x27;ve only had this 3 days, but I noticed an instant improvement in my fine lines around my eyes. I am pleasantly surprised by the results, but I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement yet with pore size. I&#x27;m using it every day and I will update my review.</li>
    <li> I had purchased 1 before about 2 years ago. I had extensive maxilo-facial surgery and my Dr. surgeon reccommended it. It accelerated the healing process (osteointegration) by 4 months. Then I gave it to my cousin who recently fell and fractured her femur. She is using it and loving it too. The Baby works on muscles, nerves, cartilage, bones, circulation. I would recommend it to anyone with sore, tired achy knees, feet, shoulders, not to mention your entire face!</li>
    <li> I bought my baby quasar directly from the manufacturer so it included a 5 yr warranty.  I&#x27;ve been using since early may, 3 times a week.  It is a little time consuming(30 mins or so)---i usually watch tv while going through the process--so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving 4 instead of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the baby quasar &amp; believe it is worth the price.  The skin above my eyes really responded to the quasar.  My eyes were beginning to develop a hooded look but the skin has perked right back up.  The marionette lines near my nose &amp;  mouth have vanished.  Overall my face looks healthy &amp; firm.  My skin tone has improved.  Also, I can finally eat ice cream without having a break-out, so it seems the light must zap acne causing bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give baby quasar a try before spending money on endless spa treatments.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all! It is snake oil. Please do not waste your money.  We all want to look younger, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any magic bullet, and this certainly is not it.  I would give it zero stars, but AMZN won&#x27;t let me.</li>
    <li> Hit the big 50 this year so this was my birthday present to myself.  I have been using the baby quasar for over 1 month now and have seen very favorable results. The areas of my face that I have seen the biggest improvement is under my eyes, my mouth area and the creases nose to mouth.  Remember to always use on a clean face, let the machine warm up before you start to use it, and be consistant!.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was due to the price. If you are looking for a beauty device that will even out your skin tone, minimize fine lines and wrinkles then consider the baby quasar.  It is very easy to use and you will get results !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/19/2012:  Still very happy with my purchase!.  I did order some safety glasses as I have noticed that when I use it my eyes feel like I was staring into the sun.  The wrinkles on my forehead...GONE!  Creases or laugh lines as they are called around nose and mouth, very minimal now.  I have been receiving many compliments on my skin and how \\&quot;young\\&quot; I look!!  Now I&#x27;m going to really concentrate on my neck area and start to do once a week maintenance on my face.</li>
