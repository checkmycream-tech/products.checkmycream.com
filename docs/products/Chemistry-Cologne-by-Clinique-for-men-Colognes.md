      <li>love the smell of this cologne</li>
      <li>-- it&#x27;s strong, very strong.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a fresh fragrance that gives you the scent of having just gotten out of the shower all day long.</li>

    <li> Not very good at all. Very bland and plain, I do not have the language skills to break it down into scientific term on why this cologne does not work for me. I am not picky or have high standards but this was a huge dispointment. Gave it too my friend and he does not like it either. His words were as mine.. does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> People have always told me that they like the way I smell when I wear this, so, here I am.  Getting harder to find, but, Amazon had it, and, the price was very reasonable.  And.. now I still smell great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for 20 years (which could seem kind of boring). It&#x27;s a classic, light fragrance that stays fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne.  It&#x27;s a fresh fragrance that gives you the scent of having just gotten out of the shower all day long.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this cologne</li>
    <li> Great, original perfume. No faux stuff in the bottle!</li>
    <li> Smells great but not too strong! Very manly scent!</li>
    <li> Best price on the internet.  I have women stop me to ask, &amp;#34;What are you wearing?  I want to buy this for my significant other.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Well this fragrance has one thing going for it -- it&#x27;s strong, very strong. 2 sprays of this should be sufficient enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flipside, I don&#x27;t see why anyone would wanna wear this though. The scent is really invasive and overpowering. It&#x27;s not easy on your nose and the only time I could ever find a use for this kind of scent is if you want to passive-aggressively disturb everyone in your environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really wanna try Clinique, try their other cologne -- Clinique Happy For Men.</li>
    <li> I love how women always comment on how good I smell with this cologne.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. My husband found it ok and prefers Armani. But I love the smell of it. I love Clinique woman&#x27;s cologne too.</li>
    <li> Was a gift. The person seemed to like it.</li>
    <li> As soon as the scent hits me, it definitely does something to MY chemistry! I will always love it! If Clinique ever discontinues it, I hope to have amassed a personal stockpile!</li>
    <li> love it ..smells good</li>
    <li> It either works for your body chemistry or it does not. Hence: Chemistry! Clinique discontinued the product for awhile; I am so pleased that it is still available. I receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product</li>
