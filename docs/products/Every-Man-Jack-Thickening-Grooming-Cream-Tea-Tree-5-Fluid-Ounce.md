      <li>Good Product.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Ended up throwing it away, but does a nice job of styling, volumizing, and thickening.</li>
      <li>so I re-ordered some more.  </li>
      <li>No residue or clumps like many gels and pomades.</li>
      <li>I just love the way my hair look and feel after using this.</li>
      <li>Maybe the conditioning part needs a bit more improvement..?</li>
      <li>All in all, i think the formula needs to be tweaked a bit more, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite styling product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m especially impressed with how it performs on dry hair.</li>
      <li>best results were achieved by using just a very small amount to achieve a good hold and non-sticky feel.</li>
      <li>Scent is not overpowering and it is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and straight, so it&#x27;s always sticking out in all directions after a shower, This is like a combo of hair gel, mouse, paste and wax.</li>
      <li>Just re-ordered more, works great and requires a small amount to hold hair in place.  </li>
      <li>I also like the fact that the company got the product to me quickly and that its a California company.</li>
      <li>Normally hair products has a thinning effect but somehow like magic</li>
      <li>Easy to put on, and very manageable.</li>
      <li>My favorite hair grooming product so far.</li>
      <li>But it leaves hairy feeling kind of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; not very soft.</li>
      <li>Every man Jack create more volume especially at the hairline.</li>
      <li>It is very concentrated</li>
      <li>Not too stiff and does add thickness, it also has weight to allow you to style the most stubborn hairs as well.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, smells decent, not too expensive, and easy to wash off my hands after applying.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and holds it where I want it.</li>
      <li>Adds volume and thickness while maintaining the natural look and feel.</li>
      <li>A great product that feels and smells like expensive brands for a fraction of the price!</li>
      <li>(We used to live in tge next town south)</li>
      <li>Strong hold - I little bit goes a long way</li>
      <li>Found this to be particularly stiff and gritty after applying about a dimes worth, working it through my hair.</li>
      <li>Provides decent body, and control, but I want to try other thickeners since this one didn&#x27;t close the deal for me.</li>
      <li>more than any other product, this in very small quantities will hold you hair and will thicken the appearance of thinning hair at the same time.</li>

    <li> Found this to be particularly stiff and gritty after applying about a dimes worth, working it through my hair.Rather waxy for a cream. best results were achieved by using just a very small amount to achieve a good hold and non-sticky feel. All in all, i think the formula needs to be tweaked a bit more, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Not too stiff and does add thickness, it also has weight to allow you to style the most stubborn hairs as well.</li>
    <li> Good product. Seems to be working well so I re-ordered some more.  I also like the fact that the company got the product to me quickly and that its a California company. (We used to live in tge next town south)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Leaves my hair soft and holds it where I want it. It last a long time as well.</li>
    <li> It definitely cleanses. Don&#x27;t know about the \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; aspect yet-- guess I&#x27;d have to use it over a long period of time to see. But it leaves hairy feeling kind of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; not very soft. Hard to comb or style hair after without needing product. Maybe the conditioning part needs a bit more improvement..?</li>
    <li> Seems to be no better than a generic/cheap cream. Basically just holds your hair in place/makes it feel hard. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Definitely doesn&#x27;t make my hair look thicker.</li>
    <li> Provides decent body, and control, but I want to try other thickeners since this one didn&#x27;t close the deal for me.</li>
    <li> Developed a bad scalp irritation to it after a week or so. Ended up throwing it away, but does a nice job of styling, volumizing, and thickening.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve changed the scent a bit since the last tube I purchased. This is less &amp;#34;pleasant&amp;#34;. But it works.</li>
    <li> I figured since the shampoo was working so great I would try the grooming cream. It holds my hair in place without feeling stiff or plastered down. Scent is not overpowering and it is easy to apply. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> A great product that feels and smells like expensive brands for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream now for a couple of years....and i easily like it the best.  for the simple reason that, a) it works, and b) it does not leave chalky residue in my hair.  all other creams tend to leave behind a lot of residue...either that, or they just dont hold well.....not this.....keeps the hold and doesnt leave behind the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try it you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and straight, so it&#x27;s always sticking out in all directions after a shower, This is like a combo of hair gel, mouse, paste and wax. Works, looks and feels great. Easy to put on, and very manageable. Great scent.  I just wish they had a travel size...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how it works but more than any other product, this in very small quantities will hold you hair and will thicken the appearance of thinning hair at the same time. Normally hair products has a thinning effect but somehow like magic Every man Jack create more volume especially at the hairline.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair grooming product so far. It is very concentrated so just the smallest dab does it. No residue or clumps like many gels and pomades. I&#x27;m especially impressed with how it performs on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Just re-ordered more, works great and requires a small amount to hold hair in place.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite styling product. It goes on easily, smells decent, not too expensive, and easy to wash off my hands after applying. It only got 4 out of 5 because it is tough to get the last amount of the tube.</li>
    <li> Strong hold - I little bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> It has now become part of my daily routine. I just love the way my hair look and feel after using this. Adds volume and thickness while maintaining the natural look and feel.</li>
    <li> Good Product. Shipping is expensive</li>
