      <li>Especially great for those of us living in dry climates.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m so glad it is available.</li>
      <li>Received very quickly.</li>
      <li>Good for winter time dryness, ,good for rough heels also softens skin.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s rich texture is greaseless but coats and smooths skin .</li>
      <li>great  for dry hands and ends of fingers</li>
      <li>Great product esp at night with gloves for dry hands!</li>
      <li>I love that Amazon carries this because it really helps my hands.</li>
      <li>But if you are dealing with seriously chapped skin, it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>It is the best healing ointment for dry chapped hands and dry cracked feet.</li>
      <li>Love this as a black woman nastiness is the enemy I love this product ;)</li>
      <li>The ointment isn&#x27;t like  the lotion, the texture is more like their lip balms or like petroleum jelly, but a little more dense.</li>
      <li>This ointment is amazing for dry hands and feet.</li>
      <li>my hands are completely clear and smooth now...</li>
      <li>I first tried using Hydrocortisone products, but it did nothing for the rash.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always  loved this stuff as the lip balm is the only thing that actually heals my chapped lips.</li>
      <li>It seems to be a good product, although my heels are in such condition only time and use will tell.</li>
      <li>is strong at first but doesnt last and can be combined with your fave lotion</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not convinced that menthol is really required to do the work.</li>
      <li>Put this on at night before bed,in the morning it was ever so much</li>
      <li>It is very greasy.</li>
      <li>Within 48 hours it was back to normal completely but at the very first sign of my hands drying out again, I would put more carmex on it and it would completely restore my hands.</li>
      <li>It also leaves that slightly oily feeling that petroleum jelly usually leaves so if you don&#x27;t like that feeling than I wouldn&#x27;t buy this, if not its perfect!</li>
      <li>ChapStick bows down in awe to the superior product in the yellow jar.</li>
      <li>within 24 hours my skin was almost like new again!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I can highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Starting using it right</li>
      <li>This product has given me new hands.</li>
      <li>As others have said, it&#x27;s pretty much a giant tub of the glass lip ointment.</li>
      <li>feet are so soft in morning!</li>
      <li>seems to be same great stuff - just maybe a little softer - as in the lip balm jars - only in a larger container.</li>
      <li>Using this along with the Shea Butter leaves my feet feeling soft.</li>
      <li>In one week, my feet were completely healed and soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>took two days to get my ruff hand back soft highly recomended for contractors or any body who works with there hands</li>
      <li>It really does help soften really dry skin.</li>
      <li>We were recommended this ointment by our general contractor.</li>
      <li>My wife likes these bigger jars to use on her feet to make them soft and eliminate cracking.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend anyone with extremely dry skin to buy this!</li>
      <li>My elbows weren&#x27;t as rough and after a week they had become very soft.</li>
      <li>since i&#x27;ve been using this ointment, my chapped hands are normal again and the product doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily as other creams.  </li>
      <li>I had been using bag balm under my nose when I had a cold and was wiping it raw, but this stuff is pure magic for that!</li>

<li> I had been using bag balm under my nose when I had a cold and was wiping it raw, but this stuff is pure magic for that!</li>
<li> It was far less expensive locally, so the value compared to the little glass jar is amazing!</li>
<li> Had some really rough and cracked/bleeding skin on my hands and this cleared it right up after regular use for a few days.</li>
<li> I used it mainly for my elbows which were extremely dry (they seriously felt like sand paper and were very white with cracked skin) and it really helped soften them.</li>
<li> It worked well for my cracked, dry cuticles and finger tips.</li>
<li> but none of them healed my dry cracked skin and one day I was using the carmex lip ointment and got fed up with my extremely dry skin</li>
<li> Works for dry skin and blisters</li>
<li> This works well on dry skin, knees/elbows, cracked hand/feet, fingernails &amp; cuticles.</li>
<li> had a thumb that was split from being so dry from all the time I spent with my hands in water during our remodel.</li>
<li> I use it daily to keep those little dry spots on my elbows and heels moisturized.</li>
<li> I bought this to treat very dry and cracked feet at the recommendation of a family member.</li>
<li> My hands are in considerably better condition after using this a few days due to the cold winter.</li>
<li> I burnt my arm slightly taking something out of the oven,helps heal minor burns too!!</li>
<li> Due to the menthol, it smells like I&#x27;m wearing Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub.</li>
<li> Other products just cover up the dryness.  </li>
<li> Put on a little so that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
<li> Like Vasaline with a little tingle.</li>
<li> with the most minor cold, i get cold sores</li>
<li> Slightly greasy when you first apply,just give it a few minutes to soak into your skin and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a small bucket of Carmex.  </li>

    <li> Great product esp at night with gloves for dry hands!</li>
    <li> Carmex is a phenomenal product--I&#x27;ve used it on my lips for years.  My wife likes these bigger jars to use on her feet to make them soft and eliminate cracking.  So many uses--shaving cuts, for example.  ChapStick bows down in awe to the superior product in the yellow jar.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend anyone with extremely dry skin to buy this! I have such horrible dry skin in the winter and it always cracks and burns. I tried all the expensive lotions out there but none of them healed my dry cracked skin and one day I was using the carmex lip ointment and got fed up with my extremely dry skin and I put it onto my hands and within 24 hours my skin was almost like new again! I was so relieved! Within 48 hours it was back to normal completely but at the very first sign of my hands drying out again, I would put more carmex on it and it would completely restore my hands. I wish I would have thought of this before I spent all my money on expensive lotions that didn&#x27;t do anything!</li>
    <li> Love Carmex, and this huge size is great. I&#x27;m so glad it is available. I use it daily to keep those little dry spots on my elbows and heels moisturized. It works great for my cuticles too.</li>
    <li> I just put it on my hands and it feels so gross - it is just a giant bottle of the same carmex for your lips&lt;br /&gt;You are better off buying dollar store lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret buying it and now I feel like a grease ball</li>
    <li> Love this as a black woman nastiness is the enemy I love this product ;)</li>
    <li> I began using this product after a body wash product gave me a terrible rash.  I first tried using Hydrocortisone products, but it did nothing for the rash.  I saw this in the store, and decided to get it a shot.  It works WONDERFULLY.  I also have eczema, and have found that this ointment has cleared that as well.  This is truly a great product!!</li>
    <li> My hands are in considerably better condition after using this a few days due to the cold winter. However, I really hate the smell. Due to the menthol, it smells like I&#x27;m wearing Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub. I&#x27;d much more prefer a neutral scent. I&#x27;m not convinced that menthol is really required to do the work. Once this tub is out, I&#x27;ll be switching brands.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!! I normally only buy the Carmex lotion and lip balm but when i saw this product I decided to give it a try since it wasn&#x27;t too expensive. It really does help soften really dry skin. I used it mainly for my elbows which were extremely dry (they seriously felt like sand paper and were very white with cracked skin) and it really helped soften them. I had noticeable results after two days of using the product. My elbows weren&#x27;t as rough and after a week they had become very soft. I applied a small amount twice a day every day, once at night before bed and once in the morning after a shower. The ointment isn&#x27;t like  the lotion, the texture is more like their lip balms or like petroleum jelly, but a little more dense. Over all it would definitely recommend this product. It also leaves that slightly oily feeling that petroleum jelly usually leaves so if you don&#x27;t like that feeling than I wouldn&#x27;t buy this, if not its perfect!</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled to find this product. It is the best healing ointment for dry chapped hands and dry cracked feet. It softens the skin and protects it. I use it regularly, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> with the most minor cold, i get cold sores so i have been using one of the Carmex products for some years.  the cold, dry winter weather brings chapped hands along with it.  since i&#x27;ve been using this ointment, my chapped hands are normal again and the product doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily as other creams.  i&#x27;m very satisfied with the ointment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small bucket of Carmex.  Like Vasaline with a little tingle.</li>

    <li> Excellent vendor. It got here in 2 days.Carmex Original Healing Ointment is great for cracked skin on your feet and hands,and only takes 2 or 3 treatments.</li>
    <li> great  for dry hands and ends of fingers</li>
    <li> took two days to get my ruff hand back soft highly recomended for contractors or any body who works with there hands</li>
    <li> I love that Amazon carries this because it really helps my hands. I wash my hands a great deal with my profession and this really helps during the winter months.</li>
    <li> Very good healing ointment.  It worked well for my cracked, dry cuticles and finger tips.</li>
    <li> I use this on my feet. Using this along with the Shea Butter leaves my feet feeling soft.</li>
    <li> How bad could it be,it&#x27;s Carmex! I&#x27;ve always  loved this stuff as the lip balm is the only thing that actually heals my chapped lips.Other products just cover up the dryness.  So - I read all the reviews here, and decided what the heck - I love the lip balm so will try this. This is great - works on chapped hands, cracked heels, AND - I rub some in to my cuticles to help keep everything soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hands are in water a lot. This product has given me new hands. This ointment works best when applied to damp skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom for Christmas. She has eczema terribly and Carmex healing ointment is one of the only things that soothes her skin. A really wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as the small tubes, but works OK and is good bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> This ointment is not for everyone. It is very greasy. But if you are dealing with seriously chapped skin, it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Had some really rough and cracked/bleeding skin on my hands and this cleared it right up after regular use for a few days.</li>
    <li> It works.  Put on a little so that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Soaks in and you get smooth results.</li>
    <li> great product I love it  really like it.  I will recomend this product thank you I will get more of this soon.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for keeping your heels and feet soft.  Put on at night and sleep with socks...feet are so soft in morning!</li>
    <li> We were recommended this ointment by our general contractor. He did a lot of work on our home,laying tile on floors and walls,grouting,sealing,etc. He never wears gloves. Saw him rubbing something into his hands each day before his lunch break and at the end of his work day. Asked him what it was. He told us the name and said it was the greatest. No one gets drier hands than he does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran to Amazon immediately after trying some. Received very quickly.Starting using it right away!&lt;br /&gt;I had a thumb that was split from being so dry from all the time I spent with my hands in water during our remodel. Put this on at night before bed,in the morning it was ever so much better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Slightly greasy when you first apply,just give it a few minutes to soak into your skin and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I will never let myself be out of this in our home from now on!! Smells great too!! My husband loves it and uses it too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I burnt my arm slightly taking something out of the oven,helps heal minor burns too!!</li>
    <li> This stuff will heal anything.</li>
    <li> An excellent product for dry skin care.  I can highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> seems to be same great stuff - just maybe a little softer - as in the lip balm jars - only in a larger container. works amazing for my chapped/distressed/cracked eczema hands. also use the carmex lotion now at nite . my hands are completely clear and smooth now...</li>
