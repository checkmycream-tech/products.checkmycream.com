### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Beautiful color</li>
      <li>my mother is happy with his wig.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>Nice amount of material.</li>
      <li>Nice quality</li>
      <li>A pleasure to deal with M4U. Wig is a high quality item with a very good price.</li>
      <li>wife finds it ok according to situation</li>
      <li>I make sure to apply some makeup.</li>
      <li>I love the style.</li>
      <li>I can see the scalp on top.  </li>
      <li>Love the color and fit.</li>
      <li>A+A+A+A+A+  Very nice looks very natural, quick shipping, arrived safely... A+A+A+</li>
      <li>This wig is light and easy to wear and for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>I loved this wig, looks very cute, highlights are very well done and looks like a natural hair.</li>
      <li>, one of them was accurate</li>
      <li>It looks fabulous on her.</li>
      <li>This wig came exactly as pictured and I love the color with the highlights.</li>
      <li>The highlights are not like shown and I wish they were but overall a good wig.</li>
      <li>Full wig.</li>
      <li>This week looks nice on the sides but on the hairline &amp; the top of it and at where the hair originate at the front center</li>
      <li>It just looks more old lady like than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>She had gotten a wig worth over a hundred dollars which she cut, or should I say massacred</li>
      <li>It does take awhile to receive but the wait is worth the cost and time.</li>
      <li>Came well packaged but not too lifelike...</li>
      <li>The picture shows it to be a warmer amber with golden highlights.</li>
      <li>I love a good deal, and was willing to take a chance that this might be close to what I would receive (worse case scenario needing to take a trip to the salon to have it altered/styled) still saving over a hundred bucks.  </li>
      <li>Yes I&#x27;m planning to order more for a big company in mexico</li>
      <li>Seller has a great product, only had a concern that the color was slightly off and then seller gave us full refund.</li>
      <li>Hair quality is good, but not excellent but for the price you can not ask for more.</li>
      <li>It was too large for my head, too.</li>
      <li>Although I appreciate and read reviews and they absolutely influence the purchases I make on Amazon, I have never written a review myself.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it, so</li>
      <li>With that being said, this purchase was such a flagrant misrepresentation of what was pictured and described on-line that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep at night if I didn&#x27;t make other buyers aware.  </li>
      <li>WHERE NEAR what I though I bought!!  </li>
      <li>The wig was cheaply made and shed a lot with minimal contact.</li>
      <li>It is really stiff and teased under the top layer to give it volume.</li>
      <li>Feels natural.</li>
      <li>I like this wig very much except it has the part down the middle and the picture looked like it was a side part with bangs</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nice amount of material. The highlights are not like shown and I wish they were but overall a good wig.</li>
    <li> returned this item it&#x27;s color was darker than expected.</li>
    <li> This wig came exactly as pictured and I love the color with the highlights. I made a few adjustments (cut the bangs) and wore this to lunch with my friends and they raved about it. This wig is light and easy to wear and for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> It is really stiff and teased under the top layer to give it volume. I didn&#x27;t really like it, so I put it under my mattress for a week or so to flatten it out some. Not quite like the picture anyway though. It isn&#x27;t bad! It just looks more old lady like than I was expecting. The picture shows it to be a warmer amber with golden highlights. In reality its a dirty dishwater blonde with what looks like grey or white highlights. Tried to get a picture of the teasing/crimping layer.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Beautiful color, I trimmed the bangs a bit to suit me</li>
    <li> Very nice. Feels natural. Full wig.</li>
    <li> Disatidied with product. Donated it.</li>
    <li> Nice quality but if you have long hair the cap is too small to hold all if your hair and these are non returnable.</li>
    <li> I like this wig very much except it has the part down the middle and the picture looked like it was a side part with bangs pulled over.  Love the color and fit.</li>
    <li> This week looks nice on the sides but on the hairline &amp; the top of it and at where the hair originate at the front center it&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t to the lock naturally as expected.</li>
    <li> This wig looks like someone skinned his Shitzu</li>
    <li> I bought this for a co-worker who has/had cancer, I wish I could upload her pic here to share with everyone. It looks fabulous on her. She had gotten a wig worth over a hundred dollars which she cut, or should I say massacred and it looks horrendous. It does take awhile to receive but the wait is worth the cost and time.</li>
    <li> A+A+A+A+A+  Very nice looks very natural, quick shipping, arrived safely... A+A+A+</li>
    <li> The wig I received looks nothing like the one in the picture.</li>
    <li> same comments on a similar item....wife finds it ok according to situation</li>
    <li> it wears shorter than it appears in the picture</li>
    <li> A little difficult to style, but for the money is OK.</li>
    <li> After the long, long wait to receive  I was very disappointed with the quality of the wig. The wig looks  like plastic doll hair. I would not wear it out in public. I guess you get what you pay for, but in this case it&#x27;s over priced because I paid for something I cannot use. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a chemo wig; it was too ashy; almost green. It was too large for my head, too.</li>
    <li> The wig was cheaply made and shed a lot with minimal contact.</li>
    <li> It is so itchy.  It is so thin I can see the scalp on top.  I love the style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product doesn&#x27;t look anything at all like it does in the photos and I will need to return it.</li>
    <li> I loved this wig, looks very cute, highlights are very well done and looks like a natural hair. Hair quality is good, but not excellent but for the price you can not ask for more.</li>
    <li> The cut and color is not exactly as pictured but it is still doable to wear. It goes well with several outfits and to prevent a washed out look I make sure to apply some makeup.</li>
    <li> my mother is happy with his wig.</li>
    <li> Yes I&#x27;m planning to order more for a big company in mexico</li>
    <li> Came well packaged but not too lifelike...</li>
    <li> Although I appreciate and read reviews and they absolutely influence the purchases I make on Amazon, I have never written a review myself.  With that being said, this purchase was such a flagrant misrepresentation of what was pictured and described on-line that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep at night if I didn&#x27;t make other buyers aware.  I love a good deal, and was willing to take a chance that this might be close to what I would receive (worse case scenario needing to take a trip to the salon to have it altered/styled) still saving over a hundred bucks.  What arrived was NO WHERE NEAR what I though I bought!!  I ordered three wigs, one of them was accurate the other two were SOOOO bad!!! Attached is a photo of what was supposed to be this &amp;#34;fabulous&amp;#34; brown/gold wig.  (Check out the part line, so frizzy you would never wear this in public!)</li>
    <li> Seller has a great product, only had a concern that the color was slightly off and then seller gave us full refund. A pleasure to deal with M4U. Wig is a high quality item with a very good price.</li>
