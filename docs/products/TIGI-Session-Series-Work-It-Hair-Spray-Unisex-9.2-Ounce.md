      <li>Spray nozzle breaks - product is good but every container breaks</li>
      <li>I have used this Work It for quite a while and love this hairspray!  </li>
      <li>now if they can come up with a better can and not change the product I would never use anything else!</li>
      <li>I love all of the TIGI products!</li>
      <li>The actual product is great, smells great, holds great....</li>
      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>I love it it holds and makes my hair smell good</li>
      <li>I love this hair spray--the fragrance and the right holding power for my fine, curly hair are perfect.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite hairsprays and what an awesome seller, fast communication, overall great great.</li>
      <li>This is a great working hairspray that gives light texture to my fine hair helping hold the style all day.</li>
      <li>As always, best prospect ever and ships super fast</li>
      <li>and now I can&#x27;t use the full bottle!  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;VERY SEXY\\&quot;!!!</li>
      <li>i love this hairspray - it does smell slightly like cotton candy to me, but it works great.</li>
      <li>just right!</li>
      <li>This hairspray is great because it sprays out in a very fine mist,  and has a hard hold.  </li>
      <li>I really like this hairspray because it holds my hair lightly while keeping it from getting frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I give it 0 stars for faulty spray cans (I keep buying it hoping those will improve, but out of the last 4, I&#x27;ve been able to use maybe 1.5 cans worth of the product, making an already pricey product exorbitant!).</li>
      <li>The nozzle never worked right</li>
      <li>My order came super fast.</li>
      <li>Guess I need to find another favorite hairspray, as on top of it, I can only find it Amazon, not at any of my local outlets.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that the nozzle clogs easily.</li>
      <li>The spray is also not sticky unless I use too much.</li>
      <li>really holds.  </li>
      <li>has too much perfume in it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this and it arrived in a decent time.</li>
      <li>It also makes it look as if it has a little more body.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not worth mailing back and paying postage</li>
      <li>We live in TN, and it holds my hair in the style I created, in the morning, all day.</li>
      <li>so I bought two of these big cans and the first one immediately clogged up</li>
      <li>Not stiff or sticky but</li>
      <li>I find it hard to believe they can&#x27;t do a better job on canning this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier to just order on line and keep an extra on hand!</li>
      <li>I have used this product about 6 months on my very fine, thin hair &amp; this spray helps to keep it in place.  </li>
      <li>If you think this is the same as the old blue can we used for years, it is not.  </li>
      <li>Love the hold and scent of this hairspray ... have had trouble in the past with the spraying mechanism (will not spray) .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> As always, best prospect ever and ships super fast</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray--the fragrance and the right holding power for my fine, curly hair are perfect. That&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. I give it 0 stars for faulty spray cans (I keep buying it hoping those will improve, but out of the last 4, I&#x27;ve been able to use maybe 1.5 cans worth of the product, making an already pricey product exorbitant!). I&#x27;m considering writing the company, but one reviewer said that they had already contacted the company about this issue, to no avail. Guess I need to find another favorite hairspray, as on top of it, I can only find it Amazon, not at any of my local outlets.</li>
    <li> TIGI has very good products, however the can for the Work It Hair Spray and the Finishing Spray, which I purchased at the same time both leak. when I pressed on the sprayer liquid comes out from underneath which causes clogs each and every time I use it.  I had the same problem with cans purchased from a salon, so I believe it is a flaw with the design of the can itself.  The actual product is great, smells great, holds great....now if they can come up with a better can and not change the product I would never use anything else!</li>
    <li> the second time I went to use this product. There was no air pressure to push out the spray. I had another can of the same product, changed nozzles, and still no spray came out..  Will not buy from this company again</li>
    <li> I love it it holds and makes my hair smell good</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this hairspray.  Not stiff or sticky but really holds.  I love all of the TIGI products!</li>
    <li> An excellent product that keeps my curls controlled and helps give fullness to my hair style! Too bad it is so difficult to find locally, but I know that Amazon is now my go to place to order this now!</li>
    <li> Beware!!! If you think this is the same as the old blue can we used for years, it is not.  This smells so bad I can&#x27;t use it.  Bought 2 cans - what a waste!</li>
    <li> I bought this and it arrived in a decent time. As soon as I went to use it, I found out it wouldnt spray.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever bought hands down but has the WORST can I&#x27;ve ever bought. Because this product works so well I foolishly continue to buy the product that end up with faulty sprayers. I&#x27;ve contacted the company with no success. I find it hard to believe they can&#x27;t do a better job on canning this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product about 6 months on my very fine, thin hair &amp; this spray helps to keep it in place.  It also makes it look as if it has a little more body.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it is overpriced compared to other sprays.</li>
    <li> The nozzle never worked right and now I can&#x27;t use the full bottle!  NOT HAPPY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth mailing back and paying postage</li>
    <li> This is a great working hairspray that gives light texture to my fine hair helping hold the style all day. It smells Devine too!!</li>
    <li> I have used this Work It for quite a while and love this hairspray!  It&#x27;s much easier to just order on line and keep an extra on hand!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hairsprays and what an awesome seller, fast communication, overall great great. thank you</li>
    <li> Best hair spray ever. Creates a workable, bouncy, hold as advertised! My order came super fast. I will definitely reorder via Amazon when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I have had this product before in a small size from a salon. I liked it so I bought two of these big cans and the first one immediately clogged up and I can&#x27;t get it unstuck so I wasted that money.</li>
    <li> I am a GRANDMA and have very thin hair, even when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to find any of the TIGI products in several of the places I should have been able to purchase, beauty salons and Wal Mart, etc. I finally found the TIGI spray on Amazon and it helps me so much to finally style my hair and go out into the public, even if it&#x27;s misty, my hair doesn&#x27;t fell like I just put glue on it!!  AND, of course I feel \\&quot;VERY SEXY\\&quot;!!!</li>
    <li> This hairspray is great because it sprays out in a very fine mist,  and has a hard hold.  The only problem is that the nozzle clogs easily.</li>
    <li> I really like this hairspray because it holds my hair lightly while keeping it from getting frizzy.  I have curly hair that tends to frizz in the humidity, but this hairspray helps to control that problem.  The spray is also not sticky unless I use too much.</li>
    <li> i love this hairspray - it does smell slightly like cotton candy to me, but it works great. Not too stiff, not too heavy but holds my fine, thin hair just right! I did receive a can that for some reason didn&#x27;t want to spray out the nozzle correctly, but i contacted them, and they refunded my money for that one - no problem.</li>
    <li> Love the hold and scent of this hairspray ... have had trouble in the past with the spraying mechanism (will not spray) .</li>
    <li> Works and smells great!</li>
    <li> This hairspray gives a great, flexible hold.  I also love the way the product smells, it doesn&#x27;t make you afraid to breathe when spraying it on your hair.</li>
    <li> Spray nozzle breaks - product is good but every container breaks</li>
    <li> Wife received the product and the bottle would not spray.  Bit disappointing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now.  It has a fairly firm hold that is moisture resistant.  We live in TN, and it holds my hair in the style I created, in the morning, all day.</li>
    <li> has too much perfume in it.  overpowers any fragrance I might want to wear</li>
