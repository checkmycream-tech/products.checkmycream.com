<li> Ill find a product that will hold my lashes in place, you know, like the moment you first apply mascara...</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula, or if my skin has changed, but I had to stop using it because I found that it smeared terribly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. It clumped up when putting it on and flaked off. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I buy mascara all the time in hopes Ill find a product that will hold my lashes in place, you know, like the moment you first apply mascara... I have come across some good products in my searching, so I guess I would recommend this Mascara, I&#x27;m not that excited about it but it works well...</li>
    <li> El articulo tal cual como describia el vendedor, el paquete arrivo en el tiempo previsto y el embalaje era el adecuado. No tengo ninguna queja.</li>
    <li> It was not effective. I found loreal mascara to be awesome. This product is great for sensitive eyes , but it gets clumpy.</li>
    <li> I have used Clinique products for years and would higly recommend this mascara to everyone. It is easy to use</li>
    <li> The mascara works well.  It lengthens, and thickens, without clumping.  I wish the brush was different.  It feels too soft.  I&#x27;m use to the brush on Lancome Definicils, which is my favorite mascara.  However, this is really nice mascara as well.</li>
    <li> For this price, I should have bought out all of them.  These are so compact and cute.  They give long dark eyelashes with one application. No need to double up.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, exactly as described exactly as described exactly as described exactly as described exactly as described exactly as described&lt;br /&gt;really it was great!</li>
    <li> They are pretty big for sample size products.  I don&#x27;t go through mascara very fast so they will last me a long time.  Love the clinique products.  Just great quality mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> excelente producto llego a la fecha esperada y en buenas condiciones todo el proceso fue muy rapido y sencillo gracias</li>
    <li> I received the product in excellent conditions and on time as expected. It was a really good service. I recommend them!</li>
    <li> The mascara alone did not thicken my lashes, however when used with Lancome it made my lashes gorgeous.  What I do like is that the mascara does not clump.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used plenty. My eyes recently became sensitive to mascara and I have been trying to find one that is hypoallergenic and does what I want it to do by flowing on easily and evenly while also lengthening and separating the lashes. BINGO...this is it. There is no clumping even with additional layers of mascara to my lashes. The BEST mascara I have used in my lifetime.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Thank you so much! It is exactly what I expected... couldn&#x27;t be more pleasesd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a great day!</li>
    <li> This mascara does wonders, it just extends your lashes without making them look like you have too much mascara on. And for that price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras! I bought these for my mom so she could try it out and she liked it too!</li>
    <li> How nice to finally find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump!  The sample size is great as it doesn&#x27;t dry out so soon.  I&#x27;m a convert!!</li>
    <li> I used to LOVE this mascara. It was my favorite for years. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula, or if my skin has changed, but I had to stop using it because I found that it smeared terribly. I found myself with perpetual raccoon eye. The positives, this mascara glides on like no other I have tried, almost like it is a lotion. It is also virtually clump free. I am a fan of Clinique in general, but this mascara unfortunately does not work for me. I would suggest trying it at a makeup counter or buying a trial size before you spend so much on it.</li>
    <li> Like Clinique and have used product before.  Usually got this size in a special when purchasing other Clinique products.  Was very happy with the size at the time, as I found it very easy to use........actually more \\&quot;controlling\\&quot; for me.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best mascara. Tried all of them. This is the best. It doesn&#x27;t chunk up, it doesn&#x27;t smear. I love it.</li>
    <li> Clinque is a very good makeup.  I always have good luck with Amazon but one tube was broken, like a light bulb that is broken off at the base.  The other tube was fine.</li>
    <li> This particular &amp; exact mascara is sold at the Clinique counter at my local Dillards for $15! This is the only mascara I use. I was hesitant to purchase this wondering why two of these mascaras were under $5. (plus $5 for shipping) I wondered if it was because they were dried out or too wet. I thought since it was cheap, I&#x27;d give it a try. Not only did they arrive BEFORE estimated delivery, they were the exact same as the one I purchase at Dillards. Not too wet or dry. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now, &amp; my eyelashes are just as beautiful as buying it from Dillards. I got two of these mascaras for $10, when it would cost me $30 at the store. I just ordered more! I&#x27;m stocked up for the next year! Each one lasts me about 90 days, and I use it everyday. This would make an excellent x-mas gift for any lady of any age!! Buy them from THIS seller!! Thank you very much to the seller for fulfilling the order as well!!</li>
