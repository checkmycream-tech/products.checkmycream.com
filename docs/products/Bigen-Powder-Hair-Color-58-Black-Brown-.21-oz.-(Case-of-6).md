    <li> Just used Bigen  on my hair ! Color Black  Brown #58  . I went from plum red Back to my natural color Black this product took very well to my hair texture i mixed the power together with warm water in a bowl  took the dye brush ! for the record i needed 2 bottle of Bigen to do my entire hair ! I then put a plastic cap on waited 15 minutes wash it out my hair look wonderful . great Product.. Yvette Rivera</li>
    <li> It does not contain ammonia or hydrogen peroxide.  It is inexpensive and very easy to use.  It is extremely effective!!!</li>
    <li> One bottle might not be enough if you have a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> As described and arrived on time.  Look forward to buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Tried and true thus far.</li>
    <li> Wish it would last longer.  I have to re-color every 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find a hair color labeled &#x27;black/brown&#x27; on Amazon.  Just what I was searching for after many years of coloring my hair black using the usual products on the market which made my hair  look too stark and fake.  Bigen&#x27;s &#x27;Black/Brown&#x27; leaves my hair looking naturally black/brown, the hair color I was born with.  I recommend this product for anyone looking for a natural look.  Plus, it&#x27;s a more natural treatment for your hair at a very low price.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this hair color. I have been using it for many, many years. I would not change to any other product. Of is simple to apply and safe.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It covers the gray easily and it does NOT fade. So when I do my roots I ONLY have to do my roots. I do wish that it came with a little more product in each bottle. I have very long hair (37 inches) and it took 4 boxes the first time for complete coverage. With 1/2 inch of root outgrowth I can barely get coverage with 1 bottle and I have a small head. Once mixed you only have about 1/3 ish cup of product. I would have gone 5 stars but they really don&#x27;t give you enough product in each box.&lt;br /&gt;This is mixed with water and applied with a color brush. As expected it will stain anything it touches, including my white linolium floor. So use a drop cloth.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. It&#x27;s easy to apply not messy, no smell, and lasts longer than usual hair dyes</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is wonderful!  I have been using this color (Black Brown), for about 10 years.  It makes my hair look beautiful and natural.  I can touch up and color at the same time, with absolutely no problems.  I take my own hair color to the beauty salon, and I bring Bigen along with me when traveling.  I use no other hair color.  You will not regret using it!</li>
    <li> Great Value. arrived on time. I have been using this brand for a few years now and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used Bigen for about 15 years and I love it.  It&#x27;s safe to use with relaxers.  I would recommend it.</li>
