<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product... Love that comes 2, one for me and one for the mrs... Very strong clipper just love them...</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. Mine were old and these babies do the job! I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Great heavy duty clippers! They are sharp and work well! The only downfall is they don&#x27;t have a file that flips out like most clippers!</li>
    <li> These are great clippers.  Heavy duty and very sharp.  They don&#x27;t have a nail file attached like a lot of clippers do, which I prefer, but the clippers are so nice that I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
    <li> These clippers are a beautiful brushed aluminum.  They are sharp, and work wonders on finger and toe nails.  Thank you for a great set!</li>
    <li> In my house we go threw so many clippers. Weve tried every brand out there and none of them did a good job. They would crack and peel you nails. But these two are beyond amazing. They are really sharp so no more cracking and peeling. They can cut threw any type of toenail. Also they are easy to hold too. They are to bulky.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying using these high quality nail clipper set. Working great so far!!</li>
    <li> Very sharp and it gives clean cuts. Better than any similar product I&#x27;ve ever bought in a store.</li>
    <li> The package the nail clippers come in is SUPER cute! I love that it comes with the Toenail and Fingernail clippers because it&#x27;s harder to get your toenails trimmed with fingernail clippers, for me and my household anyways.&lt;br /&gt;These nail clippers are really durable! These nail clippers are definitely a must have! Everyone needs nail clippers and for some reason nail clippers disappear on their own so it&#x27;s good to have others on hand! These are the perfect set and I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I bought this nail clipper set for myself. I loved it so much. They are real sharp so I don&#x27;t end up with only part of my nail being cut. Plus they didn&#x27;t fall apart like many others I have purchased in the past.I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> There is nothing worse than having a hang nail or extremely long nails and you cannot find your nail clippers. I don&#x27;t think you can ever have too many nail clippers. I recently purchased a pair of nail clippers during a promotion and they are wonderful. I do not like long nails because they get in my way. I have been known to bite my nails if clippers are not available which is probably not a good idea. Sure you may say that all clippers are the same, but I have seen some nail clipper when you get ready to use the entire back end would fall off. The Malva Bell clippers are made stainless steel and feels very smooth to my touch. The edges of the clippers are sharp and clipped my nails with ease. I am pleased that the set includes a finger nail clipper as well as a toenail clipper.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of nail clippers, very nice quality. Very strong nail clipper works great on thick toenails and fingernails. They come in a cute box and would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Easy to use and handle. Great packaging.</li>
    <li> Its an ok nail clippers. I think it&#x27;s just the same as the nail clippers you can buy at any  store that sells them.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, quality made.  Love that is has both sizes. Works well!  I got this on a promotion to provide my experience about it.</li>
    <li> These were really great I love them they are made well and work really well they are just better quality than most.  I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> Sharp &amp; well made clippers! Much better quality than those at the local stores.</li>
    <li> Well made.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Cuts thick toenails great</li>
    <li> Very sharp, very sturdy, very high quality. FYI: No under-the-handle nail file...</li>
    <li> Awesome! I got these because my husbands always misplacing his so I figured why not have another set around for him. They are a really nice heavy duty set! The only thing missing is the lil inset thing you get sometimes to clean under your nails etc. on the finger nail one but for a male he doesn&#x27;t care about it :) really worth it!</li>
    <li> I finally found a good set of nail clippers . They are easy to use , sharp and good quality. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice quality products &amp; fast shipment</li>
    <li> The Malva Bell Precision Nail Clipper Set contains a large clipper and a smaller clipper both in attractive brushed matte finish stainless steel.The design is typical but it&#x27;s obvious that these are higher quality clippers than you normally find at the pharmacy.I would definitely recommend these to anyone is looking to get a sturdy, good set of nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Great high quality nail clippers.</li>
    <li> great product - much stronger than expected, would buy again 100%</li>
    <li> Handed these right over to my husband and he went to work on his nails. If they can snip his talons off then they can do anything!</li>
    <li> Cuts tuff nails great</li>
    <li> Great quality product and works great!</li>
    <li> These clippers are high quality (similar to expensive name brand clippers) and cut through finger and toenails with ease!</li>
    <li> Nice fingernail and toenail clipper set. It is sharp, easy to hold and no stress when clipping my fingernails or toenails. It is also non slip because of the design and the matte finish. It is packaged nicely so it can be given as a nice gift.  It also has a money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> These are good nail clippers, but not worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these to replace my old, worn out clippers, and am glad I did. Right out of the box, both clippers were extremely sharp and I no trouble clipping my toenails or fingernails. The large nail clippers are perfect for clipping toenails and the smaller ones are perfect for fingernails as advertised, but are certainly interchangeable. Both make clean, smooth cuts with very little effort. The clippers themselves feel a little cheap, but make up for it in the premium non-slip matte finish that make them easy to grip. The only other noticeable flaw is that neither of the clippers have the flip out file/pick that many other clippers do, which was a little disappointing. Overall, though, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very strong material and it clips the nail great, it is nice sharp and you don&#x27;t have to put much effort on the toe nails. It Does a great job!</li>
    <li> been needing some and these worked great</li>
    <li> These are really great nail clippers they are sharp and they cut through the toughest nails. They are very easy to squeeze to get cut and love the box that they came in. They have a nice grip to them and easy to clip. They have a hole in them so my boyfriend can clip it onto his key ring and always have it with him. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it didn&#x27;t have a catcher to them but that is fine. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I have ever used.  I love how they are a nice brushed steel and not shiny chrome plated; you can really get a good grip on them.  They just feel like high quality clippers.  They work excellent.  They leave a nice smooth edge; I barely had to file after I was done clipping my nails.  I would highly recommend these to everyone I know.  Awesome clippers.</li>
    <li> Awesome nail clippers, keep the big one at home and the little one in my bag.  Really sharp and accurate, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> Great set! They are stainless steel and very sturdy to use. The bigger one is a bit too big but otherwise they are of great quality.</li>
    <li> Works great  love these</li>
    <li> Not a bad buy. It cuts nails easily. i don&#x27;t have to squeeze it too hard for it to go through the nail.</li>
    <li> Solid product. Strong enough for the whole family&#x27;s nail clipping needs. The two sizes are great for meeting different needs. The small ones are perfect for clipping an infant&#x27;s nail, which is wonderful!!</li>
    <li> i love it.  we used them right away as soon as we received it, the small one is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s tiny nails.no cut or anything. very well made. recommended to try this and u wont regret</li>
    <li> Nice clipper set!  They work fantastic, and I really like how they look!  Now I&#x27;ve got to hide them from the rest of the family so they don&#x27;t disappear and I can find them when I need them!  Haha</li>
    <li> These clippers are comfortable and sharp and work great. The finish is pretty. We love them. I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re so expensive, actually, but they are the best set we&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Good weight, nice and sharp, works very well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the fingernail clippers. Every nail I clipped I had to pull off after, as if they were not fully cut through. My nails are thin and brittle, but I&#x27;ve never had clippers perform like these. I prefer a nice clean sharp cut. The toenail clippers were better but not the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Good nail clippers for family. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I really needed some nice nail clippers, especially since I&#x27;ve started taking better care of my nails and using Jamberry nail wraps. This set is really good quality! I liked the packaging, too. It would make a perfect gift. The clippers are very sharp and precise and cut very neatly without tearing the nail. The only thing I was confused on was which one is for toes and which is for hands - I had to actually look it up because it&#x27;s no where on the packaging or in the description online. (Larger one for toes, smaller for fingernails.)</li>
    <li> Malva Belle nail clippers are high quality, stainless steel, and easy to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in a really cute box just like their blackhead remover which is nice if you want to gift these. We are always losing nail clippers in this house or they get dull pretty easily because they are really cheaply made. We don&#x27;t have the issue of these being or going dull. This set comes with a smaller clipper which is used for your finger nails and a larger one, frequently used for toe nails. Both of them are extra sharp so they cut with ease even through thicker nails. They both also have holes on the bottom to put these on a key chain for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this set and I keep it in my &amp;#34;nail art box&amp;#34; with all my polishes and files.</li>
    <li> Impressed with these finger and toenail clippers. I have been looking for a sturdy pair of nail clippers to use on both my hands and feel. I am very happy so far. They are very comfortable to hold, easy to use, and do a great job at cutting nails. The emery board on the underside of the handles is a nice touch. The great customer service provided by Harperton employees is an added bonus. Would definitely buy again if and when I need to. These are the best nail clippers</li>
    <li> Got these for my mom because she asked me to get her some and I just happened to come across this set right after she asked so I got it and she is very happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Nice and sharp!</li>
    <li> ,This is a very nice. Especially  for it having two in the set. The big one is strong and durable, perfectly sized. The little one is a good size for your purse. Both are easy to use. Fast shipping and a great price&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer ; I was given the product at a discount in exchange for an honest review!</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers.  They have sorta a matte finish which I like.  Easy to use doesn&#x27;t stick at all.</li>
    <li> Very strong &amp; sharp! Usually I have to use more force to trim nails but these cut like a hot knife through butter. They have a slight texture to them so you can grip them better then the normal nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Received at reduced cost very nice clipper set heavy duty type not flimsy sharp cuts nails without a problem.</li>
    <li> Perfect! My husband keeps taking my clippers.... I&#x27;m hiding these</li>
    <li> Recently  I purchased this product. Well its really good and light and works well . I would like to recommend this product due to its quality and timely delivery and elegant show</li>
    <li> I won these in a giveaway on a blog. They are pretty nice clippers. I like that you get the small one for your fingernails and the bigger ones for your toenails. I gave this set to my husband because I have a bigger set of nail utensils that is fairly new. He seems to like them.</li>
    <li> Simple to use and works great don&#x27;t even need to file after!</li>
    <li> Got if for the chick... she loves it</li>
    <li> These toe and fingernail clipped works great. Sharp to cut through toenails , and delicate enough to cut with one squeeze. These are great to carry in you toilet bag while traveling. The best part you get nail flippers instead of one.  Overall a good quality product</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Makes a nice crisp cut with minimal effort.</li>
    <li> Easy to use! Good buy!</li>
    <li> Just had to buy these. Cute little gift self for the nail enthusiast</li>
    <li> Fingernail and toenail clippers - a necessity for every household. We usually just pick up the $1 set at the drugstore. But, I thought I&#x27;d try these and i&#x27;m glad I did. They are sturdy and sharp. They are comfortable to hold and easy to use when trimming. And, they make clean cuts - no splitting or breaking. Very pleased with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality set! I have bought several from Walmart and they keep snapping. These are strong and of good quality! I expect them to be around for a while! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Fabulous Clippers! Sharp- Two sizes, one for fingernails, one for toe nails! They work great!</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d write a 5-star review for something as mundane as a nail clipper but this product is excellent.  Sturdy yet sharp and delicate enough for precise cuts.  What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> These are brushed stainless which gives them a good feel and look. They are really sharp with a solid hinge, so you get a good clip. I cannot attest to durability as I have only had them a few weeks.</li>
    <li> These are very good, for everyone to shape-up with!</li>
    <li> These come in perfect sizes. A great deal to get. My daughter is able to use them with no problem</li>
    <li> Very sharp and do the trick.  So far I really like these clippers.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are amazing. I can honestly say they are the best clippers I have ever used! I received these at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased opinion, and I am so glad I bought them! These stainless steel clippers cut very nicely, with a clean, even edge. A lot of clippers I have bought don&#x27;t cut as well, often leaving a rough, jagged edge that needs to be filed down. These clippers did not, and I am very impressed with that! I used the smaller ones on my fingernails, and the larger ones on my toenails. I have one annoying toenail that grows thicker ever since I was pregnant with twins, and I have problems getting my other nail clippers to cut it. I have to put a lot of pressure on the clippers to get them to go all the way through. These clippers are so strong that they went through easily the first time, with no more pressure than I used on my other nails. This nail clipper set would make a great stocking stuffer, and I am planning on buying several sets before Christmas!</li>
    <li> This item comes in a pair and are pretty sharp and give a clean cut.  It has a brushed silver finish which has a nice feel and looks good.  I like my items to work well but look good too so Im willing to pay a little more to achieve that.  The larger ones are good for toenails and the smaller ones for fingernails or for the kids.  The handles are easy to hold and maneuver.  It would be perfect if it had a nail cleaner attached, but thats because my kids love to play in dirt, so they get a lot of gunk under their nails. Overall a great buy if you&#x27;re looking for some sharp nail clippers that don&#x27;t leave a jagged edge.</li>
    <li> Handy little set. Finger nail clipper is adequate but the toe nail clipper doesn&#x27;t seem too sturdy and is curved. I prefer a straight cut for toes.</li>
    <li> Love these nail clips..very sharp and cut well. Got it at a reduce price for my review</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are very sharp. They are comfortable in my hand.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of nail clippers. They are super sharp and make clipping nails a quick and easy job...unlike my old dull clippers. I actually didn&#x27;t realize that my old clippers were not great until I tried this set! I have tried the fingernail and toenail and they both work equally great. Everyone needs a good set of clippers in their house, why not make it a good set that comes at a very reasonable price? I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Sturdy with a clean, sharp cut.</li>
    <li> Great set up clipper so far so good</li>
    <li> Super sharp. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very sharp clippers!!  I little small but good quality</li>
    <li> I like the quality of this product. I would have given it 5 starts if it came with a nail filer. Cuts smoothly. Nice job.</li>
    <li> Love this nude pink packaging. This can be a great gift. Made of very good quality stainless steel and very durable. Works great.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty set. Will last for a long time</li>
    <li> I ordered this set for me and me only. I hide it from my family so they don&#x27;t get ruined. So far so good. They are great quality and a great addition to my make up bag.</li>
    <li> They were very easy to use. Came in a nice package. I used them on my son&#x27;s nails and he is usually hard to allow me to clip his nails. With this set, it was very easy and he was no trouble. They are good quality and very worth the money.</li>
    <li> The package was super cute although that doesn&#x27;t determine how well the products works, it was still a nice touch! I love that it comes as a combo pack with the Toenail and Fingernail clippers, a HUGE necessity in my household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nail clippers are really durable! I love the brushed metal rather than the shiny ones you normally see in the store. These are the perfect set and I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> We received the product quickly and packaged well.  The clippers are a very nice quality.  They cut accurately and with ease.  I would recommend them for someone to purchase.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and no plastic that will break.  I bet these will last a long time.</li>
    <li> you have to apply a lot of pressure to get a clean cut</li>
    <li> these are the most durable clippers ive ever used!!  i woul really recommend thse for any one with tough nails like mine..</li>
    <li> Great quality clippers at a great price, thank you!!</li>
    <li> These clippers work great. Sharp enough to do their job. Great product that comes in a cute packaging.</li>
    <li> Nice set, works well.</li>
    <li> I would give this product a 4 and 1/2 star if I could. I really liked the material and finish on this product. It was nice and smooth and got the job done. It is great that it comes with 2 sizes so everyone in the family can use it. The clippers were also easy to use.</li>
    <li> the best nail clipper that I ever purchased.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:2223e5d79469bdf8deafb6d7be69dfee]] These are wonderful stainless steel nail clippers and would make a perfect gift for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;For demonstration, see video.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It seems like I can never find a pair of clippers when I need them so when I was given the chance to purchase these at a special price to test for quality, I was more than happy to do so.  Don&#x27;t confuse these clippers with the ones you see in the check out isle at Wal-Mart for a dollar.  These are heavy duty brushed stainless steel, much more durable than the cheapies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The duo includes a smaller clipper for nails and a larger one for toenails.  They are extremely sharp and trimmed my nails leaving no ragged edges.  You do not have to apply as much pressure on the clippers as with the cheaper ones.  I was even able to use the larger pair to trim artificial nails.  These clippers are definitely going to be hidden for mommy use only.  Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of these clippers and am sure they will last for years to come.</li>
    <li> I received a discount for this item. The large toe nail clippers work very well, they are sharp and shaped good for a nice cut. For me they are the perfect size, I have so many that are to wide for my nails and these are just right. The small nail clippers are just as sharp and strong as the big ones just a great size for small fingers.</li>
    <li> simple and strong looking.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> These are a sturdy set of clippers. They are very sharp. The only drawback is that there is no padding on the area that you grip when cutting. They look great. Only time will tell if they stand up to rust, etc.</li>
    <li> Super sharp and provides clean cuts love the matte feel not slippery at all!</li>
    <li> You have a to have this, by far the most smooth cut ever!! I tried this as soon as i got it, my feet and nails were clean and fresh, i usually have ones that hurt but this one i felt no pain. The package is superb. don&#x27;t bite your nails let this do it for you</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Love how it fits in my hands.  Cuts very well and clean and also on different types of nails.  Great!  I was able to purchase this at a huge discount through joining, elitedealclub.com.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> They are nail Clippers what can I say other then they are sharp and they work the fingernail one is not that great for a man it feels like a baby set but if you use toenail on efor both you are all set</li>
    <li> I love them and so does my husband, great product!</li>
    <li> they work great and they have a nice grip.</li>
    <li> These are sharp and work better then the others in my house</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  Item as described.</li>
    <li> These are superior nail clippers. I have owned one pair of fancy/expensive nail clippers for several years and despite having several drugstore clippers around the home, would always go out of my way for the fancier clippers.</li>
    <li> Very sharp! The shape is very ergonomic.They did a great job on a man&#x27;s very tough toenails, when some we purchased locally would not cut them at all.</li>
    <li> With 7 kids it necessary for everything in my house to be more than durable and these fit the order. Work great and quality is awesome.</li>
    <li> Great quality nail clippers. Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like how the clippers cut so cleanly! It&#x27;s easy to use, my kids use it themselves too.</li>
    <li> A wonderful duo of clippers. Leaves a perfect clip. Sharp! Didn&#x27;t tear my nails. These are durable and packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> Works good. Like the box too.</li>
    <li> Nice little set of nail clippers. It comes with two nail clippers, one for your fingernails and one for your toenails. They work as expected. I had no problems clipping my nails with these. They come in a cute pink box. This would be great for a gift or stocking stuffer for any woman or teen girl. I bought this product with a discount and I&#x27;m happy with it. I like the cute packaging and I like that it comes with two nail clippers.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good! Nice clean cut to the nails with a sleek look!! Well with the buy!</li>
    <li> I love these clippers,I can never find clippers that actually trim the right way,these are very precise,give a clean cut,no jagged edges,sharp and a very good weight,texture and feel in your hands. And of course I loved how they were packaged in a cute pink (my favorite color) box.The toe clippers aren&#x27;t too big,sometimes the toe clippers are huge and too big for a females toes but these are just right. SO happy I was given the chance to review these clippers free and give my honest opinion.I really love these and so happy that I finally have the perfect set of clippers!!</li>
    <li> This nail clipper set is super cute. It comes in a small cute package with makes it really adorable. The two sizes of the nail clipper are perfect for any size of nail to trip with efficiency and without any hurdles. Nail clippers are one of the most used and needed item at every household and having the one good pair is essential.&lt;br /&gt;We all have our one favorite at home which we always prefer using more than other. Well this one is of those for me now&lt;br /&gt;It is really sharp as I did not need to apply pressure on it to use. It looks perfect for gifting too. I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper set is FAR superior to the one I purchased a few months ago at my local drug store. They have a great weight to them and they did a wonderful job on my nails. They don&#x27;t seem to have that cheap coating that a lot of other nail clippers have too, so I bet these will last longer. Malva Belle sent these to me for review, and I&#x27;m really impressed with them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ordering more and more things online these days because with Amazon, it&#x27;s more convenient, cost effective and offers more choices then the store.  I recently moved, gave away a lot of old things and am now in the process of building back up.  This is one of those items.  I&#x27;m also trying to save money and I don&#x27;t have the budget these days to get a pedicure every week.  These clippers arrived within 2 days in perfect packaging, brand new as advertised.  They are sturdy and well made.  Looking at this nice set, it was time to put them to the test.  I happen to have a couple of toenails on each foot that are really thick and hard to cut.  Most clippers don&#x27;t work and I end up using large scissors, hence reason I used to get pedicures all the time.  I was actually quite shocked when the larger clipper fit over my thick toenail and cut it like butter.  I quickly and effortlessly cut all my toenails with perfect and easy precision.  The smaller clippers worked nicely on my fingernails.  It&#x27;s odd that you can go to the store and buy the most expensive set of clippers and have them be identical to the cheap set that hardly work just with different and more fanciful packaging.  But you can get online and find a unique product and have it work like it should work...finally!</li>
    <li> You can just look at this picture and tell these nail clippers are a better quality than any drug store brand (where I normally purchase nail clippers) and the packaging is so cute too. I received this set as a complimentary gift to provide consumers with an unbiased opinion.  I really like this set, I used them right away when I received my shipment. I have very thick and healthy nails and I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily these cut through the nail and how sharp that they are as well. These are stainless steel and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers I have ever owned. They cut evenly and you don&#x27;t have to apply a ton of pressure. I have no jagged or rough edges when I used these. The packaging is sleek and stylish. I constantly lose my nail clippers so I was really excited to get these. My favorite part of these clippers is how quickly they get the job done. Instead of attempting to get a nail off 3 or 4 times these cut right through. No more long drawn out arguments over nail clippers with my kids gives this product 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> I am frequently purchasing nail clipper as all it takes it one wild nail and my husband will snap them in two. With that said, I expect these clippers to last much longer as they are built well, they are sturdy, and do not seem as if they will break easily. These nail clippers are amazing. I can honestly say they are the best clippers I have ever used! These stainless steel clippers cut very nicely. They leave a clean, even edge and so I do not have to worry about jagged edges. A lot of clippers I have bought in the past do not cut well, often leaving a rough, jagged edge that needs to be filed down. These clippers did not, and I am very impressed with that! I used the smaller ones on my fingernails, and the larger ones on my toenails. These clippers are so strong that they will go through thick finger or toe nails the first time, with no more pressure than I used on my finger nails. I typically purchase gifts for my sisters with a theme in mind and I suspect that this coming Christmas I will be gifting with a spa theme so I can justify adding these babies into the mix! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. Good product overall!</li>
    <li> These are a very nice Nail Clippers Set. They are made of stainless steel, so they are very durable. I was a bit hesitant on buying clippers online at first, because I wasn&#x27;t able to see if they where cheaply made. They aren&#x27;t made cheaply at all. Comes in a cute little pink box. Great for stocking stuffers &amp; other gifts. They have a nice clean cut. There are two pair in the box, a smaller pair, for finger nails. And a bigger pair for your toe nails. Doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a rough jagged edge, that would need to be filed down. I purchased this clipper set at a really great reduced price. I would definitely recommend these to anyone is looking to get a sturdy, good set of nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Seem to be quality, sturdy clippers but light weight.</li>
    <li> Cute package and these work great.</li>
    <li> I received this set today and used it tonight. I used the fingernail clippers and they worked very well making it easy to get the job finished quickly, What is so neat about this product is that it comes with both the fingernail clippers and the toenail clippers.This is a great item to have in several rooms of the house because someone always seem to misplace them. This set would also be great to slip into a purse to take with you when you are on the go. This product would also make a great stocking stuffer or secret sister or secret santa gift.</li>
    <li> When I saw these nail clippers, I knew I had to try them. All the others I have bought leave rough edges or just plain does not trim properly. They say also that the blades will never go dull on these ones. (Obviously I have not had them quite long enough to test that though. We have used them at least 15 times between the kids, the hubby, and myself and they have NOT dulled one bit yet!!) This set includes the smaller clippers (2 inches long) for fingers and a bigger pair (3.3 inches long) for toes. The blades are extra sharp and meet perfectly for a nice clean cut. Unlike many other clippers that do not trim properly and leave ragged or rough edges. The clippers are made out of durable stainless steel and built to last with an elegant matte finish that prevents your fingers from slipping. They come in a cute pink box so if your giving them as a gift, it would be very easy to  wrap them. If for some reason you are not satisfied, they do offer a money back guarantee. Honestly though, I see no reason for anyone to not like these. Out of all the nail clippers I have bought and used over the years, I would definitely have to say these are THE BEST ever!! I would highly recommend these if you too have had problems finding clippers that work properly. (I received a great deal on this product through a promotion in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.  The information provided is solely my opinion and based on my personal experience.)</li>
    <li> Good quality nail clippers. It come with two sizes of clippers which makes it easy to cut Fingers and Toe nails without the hassle.</li>
