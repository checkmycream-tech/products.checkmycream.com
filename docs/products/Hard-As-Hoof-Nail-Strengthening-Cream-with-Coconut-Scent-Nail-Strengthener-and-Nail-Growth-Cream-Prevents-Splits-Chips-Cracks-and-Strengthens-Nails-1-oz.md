<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Helped but not as well as I expected it to!</li>
    <li> This product did wonders for my nails.  I&#x27;ve been worried for a while about some horizontal streaks that have appeared on my thumbnails, and I&#x27;ve had weak, easily breakable fingernails for years.  I could see a difference within a few days in my nails getting stronger and not breaking or starting to peel as often, and after a week or so I am seeing a difference in the horizontal, sort of peeling streaks in my nails.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  While I don&#x27;t love the fragrance (I would describe it as an almond smell, which I don&#x27;t care for), my 9-year-old daughter, who is into everything nails, loved the fragrance and wants to use it too.  She describes it as an apple/almond fragrance, so it must just be a matter of personal preference.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the concept of it..I do this to my cuticals and under nail tips 3 times a day.  if it works not sure yet just started using it...but I like it!  Cuticals do look better</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for several months now! There is definitely a difference in the strength and health of my nails. My nails are stronger and don&#x27;t break and chip any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it three times a day, in the morning, in the evening around noon, and before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub the cream around the cuticle, on the nail bed and under the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cream for healthy nails!!</li>
    <li> Great for cuticles as well as for nail strengthening!  I can&#x27;t figure out why stores have stopped carrying it.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Nice smelling (light cherry).  Easy to apply and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Only product that really works.</li>
    <li> Good product, and leaves nails smelling nice.</li>
    <li> love this product.&lt;br /&gt;will continue to purchase .&lt;br /&gt;My  nails looks wonderful after using for a short time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Definitely makes a difference in my nail strength and growth as well as my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Great product. My friend let me use hers for a month before I bought this, it is really nice, works great! I was trying to grow nails and this works good as both a strengthener and helps keep cuticle skin moist and healthy so it don&#x27;t rip or dry and thicken. The container looks small, but it is long lasting!</li>
    <li> As soon as this arrived I applied the cream.  I applied it several times a day and within 2 weeks I noticed that my nails were growing and that they were stronger than before using the product.  I had been to several drug stores looking for something to feed the nail bed which I believe was needed.  Every clerk wanted to sell me polish or nail hardener or filler or something to paint onto my nails. I knew that that was not the solution I needed.  Anyway this product really works.  I apply it several times a day and am pleased with the results. It is well worth the price and one jar will last a long long time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without this now, not greasy</li>
    <li> My wife just put in a second order, need I say more.</li>
    <li> Nails are surviving up here in the western mountains with this. Sore fingers improving.love the smell of this product! Wish I could buy in a larger size.</li>
    <li> My nails weren&#x27;t terrible, but they did begin to split into layers more and more the last year or so.  They had become weak and bendable, and whether that is due to aging or to nail polish use too often, I don&#x27;t know.  I do know that after using this for a couple of weeks twice daily, my nails are stronger and have stopped splitting, so I really do recommend it.  It does feel a little greasy, but absorbs within a few minutes.  If you put it on just before bed, you won&#x27;t even notice the greasy feel anyway.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after reading all the positive reviews on MakeupAlley (a great venue to learn about products that work).  My nails are dry and for some reason the nails on the longest finger on both hands have more pronounced ridges than the nails on the other fingers. and they are more vulnerable and prone to break.  I am a sometime-nail biter and cuticle torturer.  This product made a significant difference.  I took a break from all nail treatment and polishes and just used this for several weeks.  This would be five stars, even ten stars given value for money,but for one thing -- the scent.  I find it truly gagworthy.  It does have the unintended consequence, a good thing really, of compelling me to keep my hands far from my face.  But I do wish they made an unscented version of this product.  Because of the scent I will not repurchase.  I will look for a similar product without any scent. I suspect there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of difference among them given the lists of ingredients.  They key is simply to apply it consistently and often. If you can stand it.</li>
    <li> got this product because it was recommended by a friend. You get a lot for your money but I haven&#x27;t seen any strengthening characters yet</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I received it a lot sooner than I expected I would.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for about a week now but, so far so good!!</li>
    <li> I have had a long-standing problem with extremely weak, peeling nails. Recently, I bought a clear, nail polish &amp;#34;strengthener&amp;#34; at my hair salon. The owner said that her other clients were delighted with this product. I used it faithfully as directed for about six weeks. Alas--my nails were decidedly worse. Years ago I had been able to purchase Hard as Hoof  at a local store, but the product was dropped and the store manager said they would no longer stock it. Now desperate I turned to the internet and found HAH again. I ordered three jars--one for the bedroom, kitchen and purse. My nails hungrily drink in this magic potion. No, they&#x27;ve not been cured--yet, but they are decidedly improved; they even FEEL healthy!</li>
    <li> So I bought this CRAP thinking that it was going to help with my nails.  I bought the stuff in November &amp; used it twice.  My nails are an UGLY yellow... I look like I&#x27;ve got some sort of disease.  My nails are so fragile.  Splitting, cracking &amp; weak.  The nails will not grow.  They hurt &amp; they don&#x27;t seem to be getting better.  My guess is that they will have to grow all the way out before I will have any luck.  I will NEVER use this again &amp; I suggest that you all save your money &amp; your nails &amp; DO NOT touch this stuff.  I wish I knew how to contact the company b/c I have a few things to say to them.</li>
    <li> The best love love the best for short nail love I will always keep  Love love love very good for your nails</li>
    <li> I have thin, weak peely nubs for nails that won&#x27;t grow no matter what I do. I can say that this product really does work and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually helps my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it twice a day and have noticed a major difference. My nails aren&#x27;t so weak and thin anymore so they&#x27;re growing a bit longer day by day. They also aren&#x27;t peeling anymore so they look a lot nicer. It&#x27;s hard to believe a little $5 jar of cream could fix them. When I slack on using it they do get worse again though, so I know it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells like cherry-almond, really yummy. It soaks in pretty quickly and only a small amount of product is needed. I scoop out a little bit and massage it into each nail and cuticle area for about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with weak, brittle nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this works all that well. I finally found a nail coating that is probably better suited to my needs. But nail polish leaves my nails dry and tearing, whereas this stuff leaves my nails gleaming and moisturizers. And it smells great. So I haven&#x27;t resorted to the laquer yet. I want to nourish my nails before that stuff dries them out.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance and very effective. My thin nails are harder and my cuticles are softer. No more hang nails!</li>
    <li> More expensive than the competitor but left my nails, which had gotten somewhat healthier with Healthy Hoof,  split and completely fragile. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was having trouble with chipping, peeling, and brittleness. My nails were yellowing, weak and didn&#x27;t grow. I saw improvement soon after applying Hard as Hoof regularly. Now my nails are strong and growing again!</li>
    <li> So far it has not helped with nail breakage.</li>
    <li> I only rub it on my nails in the evening before I go to bed.  Unfortunately, my nails still peel and chip.</li>
    <li> My profession requires an insane amount if handwashing/ santitizer use. As a result my nails had become thin &amp; peeled easily making growth impossible.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a clear strengthening polish with poor results.&lt;br /&gt;After using this nail cream daily for one month my nails look healthy, no longer peel &amp; are thicker. They are beginning to grow nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Best price was here on amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for 40 some years.  I have a special reason behind my motivation to quit this time and looking for ways to make this attempt my final one.  The Hard as Hoof products have helped the most!  I did their Stop Nail Biting and this Nail Strengthening Cream.  Amazing!  It has been about 4 weeks.  I actually have nails (I wished I had before and after photos as they were chewed very low including the skin around them).  Before when I would try to quit, they would be so soft, fragile.  Constantly snagging, tearing and peeling.  This product has strengthened them.  I haven&#x27;t had any snags and tears yet.  And no peeling.  I&#x27;ve seen videos online of people using this...they use way too much in those.  It only takes a little bit several times a day.  (I think I&#x27;m addicted to it and use everything I wash my hands or just think about it.)  The little jar goes a very long way.  In four weeks of using, I think I have used about an eighth of the jar?  A very small amount indeed.  Great smell.  Great feel.  I will continue to use this product long after I have long beautiful nails.</li>
    <li> I rate this five stars because if you put this on your nails every night before bedtime, your nails become so hard they will be able to grow long and beautiful.  I have had brittle nails with ridges on my nails all of life.  A friend told me about this and used to get this at Walmart.  No longer available there.  Anyway, you must be religious about putting this cream on EVERY NIGHT.  Good to even put on in morning, but not necessary.  Also, good to dring protein drinks but not necessary.  THIS STUFF IS INCREDIBLE!!!  I am absolutely amazed and there are very few products in this world that make me think twice.  Much less make me write a recommendation.  I can&#x27;t afford a manicure.  You don&#x27;t need one with this cream, a buffer to shine the nails, clipper, file and go!!!</li>
    <li> My nails are so hard and strong. I use this 2 to 3 times a day. The best thing about it is you can use it on top of nail polish and it still works. I have gone from weak breaking nails to nails that everyone compliments.</li>
    <li> Breaks are fewer and clean, so much easier to repair. I could have described several of the nails as warped and can see an improvement each week. Made a commitment of 6 months and have no regrets. I keep a jar at work too!</li>
    <li> To the point: Onyx Brands, the maker of Hard as Hoof, has gone to considerable trouble and expense to TRICK YOU into buying HALF the amount product that you think you’re buying.  In other words, you’re only getting HALF of what you thought you bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See images: I cut the Hard as Hoof retail container in half.  The outer container is Part A.  The sneaky inner container is Part B, which fits inside Part A and serves as a FALSE BOTTOM that makes you think you’re buying two times the amount of product you actually receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an INTENTIONAL RIP-OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I’m a male guitarist who needs strong fingernails.  My primary instrument is acoustic guitar with steel strings.  Instead of a pick/plectrum, I play finger style, relying on my right-hand fingernails to pluck and strum.  I apply Hard as Hoof once daily, at night before going to sleep.  I’ve been using it for a year and see obvious improvement in nail strength.  On the downside, my nails seem to be more brittle now (less resilient and more prone to major cracking/chipping) but they DO stand up better to playing steel guitar strings.</li>
    <li> My nails were ruined from gel manicures. I have been trying all types of products with nothing working to restore the condition. It has been three weeks that I am using the product and there is a difference. The condition of the nails have improved tremendously. The nail base is back to a normal color  and they are not peeling at the tips. Will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> Smells great and helps my cuticle.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why some people say they hate the smell. OMG! hahaha it does not smell bad at all. drama queens over here. I find that it actually has a  nice pleasant scent. Just started using it so I can&#x27;t say whether it works or not. Once I use it for a while, I may post an update if I remember to do it. lol.</li>
    <li> Hardens nails but also the skin around them, which then cracks and becomes very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Great product, my nails are stronger and don t break so fast.&lt;br /&gt;You may find it cheaper at Wall Mart.</li>
    <li> For those with nail problems, this cream is just what is needed for strengthening soft nails. A much needed item!</li>
    <li> Love it! Nail techs are always surprised how beautiful my 70-year-old nails are. And you can be sure they make a note of the product I use.</li>
    <li> Received  this on time-started to use it and 3 days later my nails began to break..I am using as described.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Been using it for years. When my mother had arthritis, she used it several times a day on her nails. She never had nail problems due to the meds she was taking. Her doctor started recommending it to his other patients.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and has worked wonders for my nails. My nails are growing so fast and are getting thicker. I put it on several times a day and am having great results.</li>
    <li> I USE IT EVERYDAY.To make my nails like the hoofs on a horse or pig hoofs.Which ever is the hardest.lol</li>
    <li> it really has helped stop my nails splitting</li>
    <li> Even using gloves to do dishes, my nails would split, peel, and break. I asked a friend at work what she used on her strong nails, and she told me biotin, which I started using and I saw some benefit. After awhile, it didn&#x27;t look like the biotin worked anymore because the splitting started again. By accident (I wonder?), I found this at a local grocery store, right next to all the Sally Hansen nail repair &amp;#34;polishes&amp;#34; (I&#x27;ve tried them all, and they are useless). I saw results in about 3 days, and more as the days went on. My nails stopped splitting, peeling, and grew thicker, longer, and stronger. Seems the nails drink in this cream. I can even forget my dish gloves and my nails don&#x27;t break or get weak, and the product says it can even be used over nail polish, as it gets into the cuticles and into the edges and on the underside. Know what else? I did an Extreme Swamp Romp (a really dirty mud run) a few days ago and put my nails through hell. No splits or breaks at all. My local grocery store discontinued this product, but I found it at Walmart, thank God. I would not be without it, ever. I keep it near, and rub a little into my nails whenever I think about it, which is about 4-6 times a day. If you have problems nails, try this!</li>
    <li> worked well, as described.</li>
    <li> I can no longer buy this product locally, so went to Amazon and found it.  I was surprised at the cost ($25 vs. $5), but ordered it anyway as I was completely out.  Still looking for a more reasonable price and still love the product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I had been getting gel manicures for the last year and I love getting them but they really dry out my nails when they are removed and causes them to be very brittle.  I decided that I would start taking a two week break between getting my gel manicures and focus on moisturizing my nails during this period.  I had seen alot of great reviews on this product and thought I would try it.  It&#x27;s only 8.00 dollars and I have tried everything including OPI nail envy with my nails still would break. Within the first week of using this cream my nails are super strong and the tips are whiter and growing!!! I will definetly keep using this and I am glad I can continue to get my gel mani&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS. Made my weak peely nails strong and beautiful. Absorbs quickly/doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, smells amazing (cherry almond) and just works really well. I also like that it can be used on bare nails or polished nails.</li>
    <li> Almond smell is nice no greasy residue  and easy to use. Strengthens my nails and softens my hands and can be use over my nail polish if I am wasn&#x27;t some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase of this Hard As Hoof nail cream. The texture is really good. Absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue like other products I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is really good, not chemical, and it fades after a bit so it&#x27;s not too strong. My nails look and feel much better since using it and I think they will keep getting stronger. I highly recommend this for anyone with brittle or problematic nails.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple days now. And so far it is working amazingly!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My job requires me to wear gloves all day which has caused my nails to become very thin and break easily. They were peeling and cracking and were very flimsy. The second I rubbed the nail strengthening cream onto my nails, I noticed many of the peeling pieces of my nails went away. I&#x27;ve been applying this twice a day and have noticed my nails look better, are stronger and aren&#x27;t breaking as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little too strong for my tastes, but it goes away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does exactly as described. My nails are now strong and don&#x27;t chip easily. So great I bought a second one for my grandmother who was having weak nail problems. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been on this product for about a month now and I believe that it is helping.  I have splitting at the tips of my nails and it has not been helped yet.  I keep cutting them, so that the nail will grow out from the base and than the splitting will be gone.  I bought two jars and will have a better idea when used up.</li>
    <li> This nail crème is amazing. I&#x27;ve used a ton of products claiming to strengthen nails, but Hard As Hoof Strengthening Cream really works. After having acrylic nails for almost 12 years, my nails were thin and very short. In a matter of two weeks my nails are healthy, they no longer tear or split. Highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to recover from having acrylic or gel nails.</li>
    <li> After getting 3 gel manicures in a period of 9 weeks and later acrylic nails, the long tedious process my manicurist used to remove the polish and tips left my nails extremely weak, thin, and splitting both horizontally and vertically.  With 4 coats of polish on them, my nails were too weak for me to use to scratch my head.  I decided to purchase a 1 oz. jar of Hard as Hoof nail strengthening cream cherry almond scent from a Walmart store.  I paid $4.98.  It can be purchased for that same price at Walmart.com with free shipping on eligible items totaling $45.00.  Since I have been using HAH for only 3 days, it is too early to determine if this product is effective.  Hard as Hoof is supposed to help soft fragile nails quickly grow to new lengths.  The price $24.99 plus $4.29 for shipping and handling is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  ingredients listed on my bottle are: aqua, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, simmonondsia, chinensis, (jojoba) seed oil, gylcerin, glyceryl, stearate, ceramic alba (beeswax), hydrolyzed collagen, calcium pantothenate, allantoin, ethylhexyl palmitate, vitamin a, c, d e (retinol, ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, tocopherol), panthenol, natural fragrance/parfum, methylparaben, propylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/22/13:  After using Hard as Hoof nail strengthening cream since 2/4/13 (close to two months), my extremely damaged nails have become stronger and the nails on my right hand have grown beyond my finger tips.  The nails on my left hand received more damage and now I have only one nail that has a horizontal split rather than two.  The nail bed on my little finger is no longer painful when touched.  I thought my nails would not become strong until all the damaged nails had completely grown out from the cuticle (6 months).  I apply HAH to my nail beds and cuticles several times during the day and at bedtime.  I have already used one jar and keep one in my den and another one on my nightstand.  A few days ago, I purchased 2 jars at Walmart for $4.98 each.  I noticed the price for HAH has come down on this website from $24.99 plus $4.29 for shipping and handling to $14.89 free shipping but it is still pricey.  Because of the reduction in price, I am changing my rating from 1 star to 4.  This product actually is worthy of 5 stars but since the price is still somewhat high, I rated it 4.  I plan to use Hard as Hoof to maintain strong nails.  I highly recommend this product.  It is great!!!98 each.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks. The artificial cherry almond scent is gross. It smells like a cheap rest room air freshener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to say whether this stuff strengthens fingernails. OTOH, with my modifications (more about this below), it is a pretty good cuticle cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Modification: Leave the lid off the nail cream for 4-5 days. Stir the stuff once or twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do this? This thickens and concentrates the cream by allowing some of the water in it to evaporate. The thicker cream does not rub off as easily as the original, thin textured cream.</li>
    <li> I received my Hard as Hoofs two days after I placed my order! I was  really excited to get started on using this product for my nails as acrylics have really needed them up. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for under two weeks &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed that it has been growing out my nails like crazy! Being obsessed with my nails &amp; also a nail blogger, I LOVE how fast they have been growing! However, they&#x27;ve actually grown pretty thin but I&#x27;m also using Bert&#x27;s Bees &amp; I&#x27;m hoping that the two put together will strengthen them. I also found that Was Mart sells this product for half the price! If you have a local Wal Mart, you should check there first &amp; save yourself money. Defffff recommend though!</li>
    <li> Actually, waiting for nails to have time to respond.  However, I finished up a long ago ordered jar and loved it.  I did notice the new formula is slightly different; so will see if results are as good.  Would be just as happy without scent.  It is nice, but unnecessary.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this product but the mild scent. I typically use unscented products. My nails look better and are stronger.</li>
    <li> I am one of those horrible nail biters, I just picked up this product at Walmart while I was buying fake nails to put on (helps me break the habit of biting) I had very beautiful long nails then I started biting. I put this product on one of my nails and it felt amazing! It absorbs fast and makes your nails look amazing! I love the smell! I used it after I put on my fake nails on my cuticles and they feel moisturized and smell amazing. I&#x27;ll continue to use it. You don&#x27;t need a lot either just dab your finger in the jar and you can cover probably two or three nails! Very inexpensive (mine was 5$ at Walmart), I have heard about this product and I will continue to buy. My favorite cuticle cream was burts bees lemon butter until now, I think I&#x27;ll use my burts bees for deep conditioning every once in a while! I&#x27;m also looking for a nail polish to strengthen, I would love to see this brand make a polish like the cream! I feel more comfortable wearing a polish to protect my nails!</li>
    <li> this is the second pot I have had. as you only use a small amount it last about 10 - 12 weeks. my nails are in better condition than they have ever been.</li>
    <li> I would give it 10 stars if I could, I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my nails out until now. I&#x27;ve always been a nail biter or worn acrylics. Even when I hadn&#x27;t worn acrylics in a while, my nails were always too weak and flimsy to grow them out, and my cuticles always tore and snagged on everything. I recently removed my fake nails (about 3 weeks ago), and have been using this cream since. The damaged part is still growing out, but right now my nails are past my fingertips, and my cuticles are flawless! I use the cream in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Extrordinaire Gel Lacque 3 Step \\&quot;Gel Polish\\&quot; for added thickness (removes with regular nail polish remover, so it&#x27;s not harsh like shellack type products), I am just always sure to get the cream under my nails as well so that it actually reaches the nail itself instead of just sitting on top of the polish. Not only is it making my nails stronger, it helps me keep them out of my mouth if I keep the cream on there all the time (it smells great, but tastes like crap). I have a jar at work, one at home, and one that I keep in my purse. I probably apply it 10 times a day (a little overkill, I know). I found them for $4.98 each at Walmart. If you can&#x27;t find them in-store, they&#x27;re the same price online. Now go get yourself some HAH! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! To start off it came in fast. Also, the cream spells good! Yes, it is a small container but it should last you a while since you arnt suppose to put too much! Today is my 3rd day of using it and I can already tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Made my nails worse. Disappointed with purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Get my nail in good condition quickly</li>
    <li> I bought this on impulse from on of the drug stores. It is a cream you simply rub on and around your nails. I try to use it in the morning and night. It absorbs quickly into the nail and  eliminates the splits that I have from doing various chores around the house.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and if used daily, will truly harden your nails.  You must do it daily or it will not be very effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and maybe a slight improvement - jury is out, a little disappointed so far.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I was a bad nail biter and now after using this I have long hard beautiful nails!! Will be ordering again soon!</li>
    <li> Product arrived Monday, was expecting it to arrive Wednesday at earliest so very happy with promptness. However, it was not the product I thought I was ordering--a truly superb nail hardener of which a friend had given me a sample.  What I got was the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula. It appears that the money men/women must have started telling the chemists how they were to make the nail hardener to enhance the company&#x27;s bottom-line. A comparison of the two formulas shows a lot of natural ingredients in the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and a lot of not-so-natural stuff in the &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34;  The results on my nails shows &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to be ok but not worth the excitement generated by &amp;#34;old;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product. I work a lot with my hands around the house and I used to bite my nails, so they are very weak and chip easily. After just one day of applying this cream (I did the recommended regiment of 3 applications per day), my nails were already feeling stronger. Now, after only a few days of applications, my nails feel MUCH harder (they hardly bend at all), and even my flimsy, chipped nail on my thumb is feeling stronger than ever. I highly recommend this product because it works well and begins working right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the scent of the cream is very light and subtle, so it feels like I am applying nice hand lotion when I use it. I also love that you can use the cream over painted nails, because I always have my nails polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard As Hoof nail strengthening cream works, is easy and neat to apply, and very convenient to use! I highly recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Hardens and strengthens your nails.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item in November and trough no fault of the shipper or supplier, it took 3 weeks to arrive. This is a great product and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It does exactly what it says it will do! My nails are strong as ever! At first I paired it with the nailtiques but they still would peel. I have been using it in my bare nails for about a month now and they are beautiful. They have never been so strong! I have been filing them to get rid of the unhealthy bits that was there prior. I am seriously in love with this stuff!</li>
    <li> I put a lot of time and effort into my nails, and basically would do anything for them to look nice (recently found out that the top coat I use is considered hazmat material by the postal service, and my response was just, &amp;#34;WORTH IT!&amp;#34;)  I work in a pretty dry environment and have always had issues with my nails splitting and peeling. I started using this around 6 months ago and have seen a HUGE difference in my nails! They grow much longer than they used to and while they are not *perfect* they break much less frequently. I will say that you have to follow the directions on this product for it to be effective -- must apply it AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, at LEAST twice a day! I try to put it on after every time I wash my hands (I usually end up forgetting and putting it on 3-4 times a day). I keep a jar in my purse and one at my work cubicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaints are the smell (not awful but not what I would choose, wish there were other options) and that the only place it&#x27;s sold in stores is Walmart.  Seriously, Walmart is disgusting. I wish Ulta carried this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Every time I remove my artificial nails to let my real nails get healthy, I get out the Hard as Hooves and use it religiously. It also soothes the cuticle area which is usually quite damaged and sore.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing better at any price!</li>
    <li> The best thing since sliced toast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to grow out my nails until now.Before this product, my nails were really weak and would break all the time. Lucky i got this product which has helped my nails out A LOT !! This product did wonders for my nails and it did everything that it said it would do, has happened. My nails never been better and they are really strong and i could also see the growth.So i am happy and will recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous and smells wonderful -- get some right away -- my daughter and I both love it</li>
    <li> Be warned - it has a strong smell. People seem to love it but I could go without it. I&#x27;m not a huge fan. It is very sweet and cherry smelling. But the product itself is great. It really does make my nails stronger and moisture them. After a while I somewhat desensitive myself to the smell because the product itself is great!</li>
    <li> As commercial as this sounds, I saw a difference after one application: the appearance of my nails seemed to change - look firmer and less ragged; over the next several days they just got stronger. I use it 1X/day, usually before bedtime. The aroma is mild but I&#x27;m not really crazy about it - which is why I put the cream on at night, so I won&#x27;t be conscious of it.</li>
    <li> It works as well as other nail strengthening creams.</li>
    <li> Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond is the only store where I&#x27;ve found this locally, in a major city.  Use their 20% off coupon.  Cannot find at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails have been weak, like tissue paper my whole life.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older my left hand is a little better but my right hand still has weak nails.  Weird, huh?  I really wanted to have longer nails but without artificial methods involving chemicals/UV light.  After using this about a month, my nails are definitely improving, even on my right hand. Keeps my cuticles soft too , preventing hangnails.  I apply this cream on my way to work and on the way home, at bedtime and any other time I won&#x27;t be washing my hands for at least an hour or so, e.g. at the beginning of watching a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers, the fragrance is strong.  Pleasant but strong!  Would love an unscented version!</li>
    <li> I HAD USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE WITH GOOD RESULTS.  I HAD BEEN WITHOUT IT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND MY NAILS WERE BREAKING BADLY.AFTER USING HOOFS FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS MY NAILS ARE NOT BREAKING.</li>
    <li> My nails were in terrible shape due to the cold weather and dry skin. I used this for a couple of days and my cuticles are already in better shape. I don&#x27;t know if it will help them grow or not but, would be worth it either way. My sister used my cream once and she just ordered her own. Love this product and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This cream has helped to make my nails grow like wildfire. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants their nails to be beautiful. Superfast shipping and I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> My nails tend to break easily and they also do not stay smooth, no matter what time of the year it is..&lt;br /&gt;This product goes on easily and seems to soak into your nails.  In the winter when my hands get dry and crack on the tip of my fingers I rub some of this into the cracks.  I think it helps them more than just regular hand cream.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product on makeupalley.  It had so many good reviews I had to try it!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and at my current job I am washing my hands a zillion times a day and so far noticed a difference in how resilent my nails are.  This creme absorbs nicely, and is best used before bed and during the day if at all possible.  I have been putting it under my nail tips when my fingers are polished and it helps to keep them from splitting at the corners.  They are longer than ever!  I think it helps if you take a gelatin supplement and some horsetail as well.  I&#x27;ve noticed that if I take those products my nails really grow and are stronger, but still brittle.  With the supplements AND the nail creme, no more brittleness and peeling!  Just gotta keep applying it a couple of times a day instead of just at night to keep nails hydrated.  And I never used to be able to grow my nails out!  Now everyone comments on how long they are.  Oh and I have also been using nailteques formula plus 2 for the past 6 months, that product makes a huge difference but I found it a bit drying, hence the nail creme purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does exactly as described. My nails are now strong and don&#x27;t chip easily. So great I bought a second one for my grandmother who was having weak nail problems. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I tried a jar of Hard as Nail about a year ago and in no time my nails and cuticle were the best they had been for a long time. When I finished that jar I  couldn&#x27;t find it dt any local store, so I went on line. I was so glad to find it there and ordered two more jars. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have always had weak nails I had to keep them super short or I&#x27;d have them break off way down in the quick which HURTS! I have tried the clear nail polish hardener and pretty much every product I seen I tried! Nothing worked maybe because I only knew of the clear nail polish hardener and I never seem to have time to let it dry right because I live a active life. Which is another reason my nails break a lot! And like most women I enjoy getting my nails done however most solans around me won&#x27;t do fake nails and the ones that do are not very good at it! So the other night I was in Walmart just browsing about while my husband was in the sporting goods section LOL and I saw this cream it was $5 something and I thought well if it does work its only $5. So I got it and tried it the first night, now over all my nails look healthy aside from being really weak. So I don&#x27;t have any sight differences but that next day I went to work and I was going about my day and I went to open a file drawer. My thumb slipped and I thought crap my nail just broke but I didn&#x27;t feel the normal pain so I looked at it and it wasn&#x27;t even chipped!!!!! I was impressed! So now I carry thhe little 1oz jar everywhere with me work home store and when I have a few seconds I apply it! I have been using it for almost 5days and my husband swears I claw him in our sleep lol my nails are so much stronger and getting longer then I have ever been able to have them before! I would recommend this product to anyone and have! It truly works and for people like me who is almost always on the go its perfect no real wait time for it to dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for the smell.... I didn&#x27;t like it at first and honestly thought I&#x27;d never use it agian after that first time because of it but then that moment my nail didn&#x27;t break when normally it should have I was soldnd have come to enjoy the smell!</li>
    <li> the first product I have tried that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;will be buying more in the future although products does go along way.&lt;br /&gt;arrived as expected considering I live overseas and at reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;top marks!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works so great and smells amazing. Have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> It does not do what I expected. I purchased two one for my daughter and one for me. I would not recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week but I do like it. I don&#x27;t understand the complaint about the smell, I think it smells fine. My cuticles are a hell of a lot better looking in the sorry amount of use. I am using this in conjunction with NailTek because my nails really do suck that much.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, Using about 1 week applying 2-3 times a day. Ridges going away, nails are healthier, seem to be getting stronger. Cleaned out the local wal mart of 4 jars. OK smell. Great stuff, After LOTS of research this seemed to be the safest with the least amount of bad stuff in it.  USE IT! Also you might want to consider taking the supplement BIOTIN which is good for hair and nails and is supposed to help them grow, it seems to for me.</li>
    <li> bought it for my wife. she loves it. will be buying more when she needs it. here. on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The product improved my nail quality. There had more shine and I felt a moisturizing effect. My nails did seem overall more solid. Though the instructions state that you can use it over existing nail polish, I removed the polish. I do believe the product would have no effect if nail polish was present.&lt;br /&gt;I was very satisfied and would certainly recommend it fully on unpolished nails.</li>
</ol>
