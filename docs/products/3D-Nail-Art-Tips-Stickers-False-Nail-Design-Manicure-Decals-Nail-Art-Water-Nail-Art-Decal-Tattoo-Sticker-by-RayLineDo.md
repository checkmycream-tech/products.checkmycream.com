<li> I have large hands but narrow nail beds</li>
<li> The large ones will need to be cut for short or small nails.</li>
<li> Also, this design has a white background not a clear one</li>
<li> so if you paint your nails anything other than white</li>
<li> Overall, these were awkward to put on and the finished product looked cheap.</li>
<li> I hate to leave a bad review, particularly because I was impressed with the seller but these were just not the product I was looking for.</li>
<li> The decals are a little strange, it is not a transfer like the old &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; transfers that you wet the back of then slide the paper away, you have to soak the decal in water for twenty seconds, slide the decal off without bending it which is difficult and then stick it to your nail, blow dry it and then seal it with clear coat.</li>
<li> I give it 3 stars because I have to wet them to apply.  </li>
<li> item is what expected</li>
<li> Exactly as expected.</li>
<li> and I had to cut them down</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s not like a tattoo where you lay it down with the paper backing that will leave the non colored side up.</li>
<li> so if you make a mistake it is hard to fix, also the sizes are a little big for me.</li>
<li> so if you have small hands or small nails</li>
<li> I bought multiple packs of these nail art, they are very poor quality and they rip as they are applied.</li>
<li> These are so delicate looking and feminine.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your time with these!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re literally temporary tattoos for your nails!!</li>
<li> Not to bad for stickers</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> a gift and she loves them.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. They are really cool!</li>
    <li> My niece loves these.</li>
    <li> item is what expected</li>
    <li> The seller was great and the product was delivered a week before the estimated date, however I will not be ordering this product again because it was a letdown. The decals are a little strange, it is not a transfer like the old &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; transfers that you wet the back of then slide the paper away, you have to soak the decal in water for twenty seconds, slide the decal off without bending it which is difficult and then stick it to your nail, blow dry it and then seal it with clear coat. Also, this design has a white background not a clear one so if you paint your nails anything other than white it looks like you put a sticker on it. The dimensions are strange so there is just no way to make it look good. There are twelve decals but they are all different sizes so if you make a mistake it is hard to fix, also the sizes are a little big for me. I have large hands but narrow nail beds and I had to cut them down so if you have small hands or small nails these may be too big for your nails. Overall, these were awkward to put on and the finished product looked cheap. I hate to leave a bad review, particularly because I was impressed with the seller but these were just not the product I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> My mom got some they looked nice.  I think they lasted about 2weeks or so.  Not to bad for stickers</li>
    <li> I really liked the way these looked but once I tried to up them on they will not work. The paper stays on them and when you try to move it off they tear.</li>
    <li> **  ALITTLE BIGGER  **</li>
    <li> These decals are cute. But when I clear polished over them it nearly ate away at the decal. And because there were only 12 of them it left no room for error.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your time with these!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re literally temporary tattoos for your nails!! PAIN IN THE BUTT!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like. Didn;t look nice on my nail, because of the back round, it look like paper sticker on your nail. To me, compare to others I use.</li>
    <li> They where way to big for my nail had to give them to a friend</li>
    <li> Very pretty.  Colors are very true to peacocks. The large ones will need to be cut for short or small nails. and the small ones are perfect size for any nail.</li>
    <li> Look like cheap stickers. Get your nail prints from etsy. These aren&#x27;t worth a dollar even</li>
    <li> Very pleased with item, prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty on light colored nails.</li>
    <li> These too were a gift and they were loved as well !</li>
    <li> These look very cute, but they are more decals not stickers! You have to put them in water to peel off and lay it on the nail then instructions say to blow dry with a hair dryer then put on a top coat after fully dried. To many steps!</li>
    <li> Tried twice and didn&#x27;t work. They don&#x27;t mold to the shape of my nail and didn&#x27;t stick at all.</li>
    <li> I think these are awesome! Worked great on my nails.</li>
    <li> Delivered earlier than actual date &amp; looks beautiful</li>
    <li> They are beautiful. Have to wet them to put on but otherwise very nice. I give it 3 stars because I have to wet them to apply.  I just like putting stickers on and finishing. But very beautiful.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, I advise!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, these take a while to get here, but they&#x27;re beautiful!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think the decals were as detailed as the picture,no one could tell they were feathers. Went on easy, lasted 2 weeks even though I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> They were easy to apply however the instructions were not very clear and they are a bit big for regular nails.I had to figure out the you needed to peel them off the white color side up and then just hold onto the transfer and apply it. So it&#x27;s not like a tattoo where you lay it down with the paper backing that will leave the non colored side up.</li>
    <li> These are so delicate looking and feminine.</li>
    <li> It is really pretty.  I will need to cut to use.  You will need to have large nail beds.</li>
    <li> I bought multiple packs of these nail art, they are very poor quality and they rip as they are applied. I will never buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I thought these would be cute. I love peacocks but these just wherent right for me.</li>
    <li> Love the water decals!!</li>
    <li> Water transfer decals look beautiful but haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
    <li> These did not apply or stay on well. Much prefer jamberry</li>
    <li> These look even better than i was expecting!</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Easy to apply! Great price! I will definitely​ order these again and highly recommend them.</li>
