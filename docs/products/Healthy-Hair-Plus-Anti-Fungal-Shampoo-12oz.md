      <li>I wear braids in the summer time and it is good to cleanse your scalp with this shampoo once every two weeks.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells good but did nothing to help my scalp.</li>
      <li>Product  provides good relief to itch.</li>
      <li>I would say I have a good 75percent healing rate.</li>
      <li>It smells great and worked as advertised...very pleased</li>
      <li>I am glad to say that the smell is gone!</li>
      <li>Nice general-purpose shampoo, though.</li>
      <li>I am loving this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Nice smell</li>
      <li>Smell nice though.</li>
      <li>Nice scent too.</li>
      <li>I love them both for different&lt;br /&gt;reasons, the Selsun for the dandruff/the Healthy Hair, for the eczema!</li>
      <li>the antibacterial soaps worked better</li>
      <li>This shampoo is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>Every hair product I buy or have been prescribed has not been able to prevent my head from stinking up the room.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many things, nothing helped.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Instead it inflamed it even more and caused it to itch and burn.</li>
      <li>the shine is more than ever before.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for three days now, and my scalp pimples are already noticeably better.  </li>
      <li>But it does leave my hair feeling squeaky clean and the emu conditioner is nice and silky....</li>
      <li>Excellent shampoo replacwnt over many other types of over-the-counter medicated antidandruff hair products, or, astringent paraben-free, hair clarifiers, which may be a healthy way of at ripping the hair of unwanted oiliness and scalp buildup.</li>
      <li>This is really nice - helps calm itchy scalp and makes your hair feel very clean and shiny.  </li>
      <li>My head and scalp never felt so clean!</li>
      <li>Save your money, and buy a derma shampoo like Head and Shoulders, or my favorite is Aveeno nourish and dandruff free (no sodium sulfate)</li>
      <li>As another reviewer stated, I used Head&amp;Shoulders Clean and that worked a lot better compared to this product.</li>
      <li>There was a problem with my order, but they were very quick and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I started using the Healthy Hair Plus Anti-fungual shampoo along with TriDerma Intense Healing Cream and within two uses the improvement was amazing.</li>
      <li>It does what it is supposed to, but also smells pretty nice to.</li>
      <li>Hoped it would be effective because of higher price.</li>
      <li>At any rate, after a couple of uses, I noticed a huge difference in my scalp</li>
      <li>Fortunately the smell somewhat dissipated after blow drying it, but I could still smell mustiness.</li>
      <li>Its definelty worth it. :)</li>
      <li>So far my scalp feels good for one day, maybe two, and then the itching starts again.  </li>
      <li>So far its been good product for me.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much and will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>If even for that fact, this product is so worth it!</li>
      <li>It did clean my hair, but that was all.</li>
      <li>So if you have a real dermatitis scalp condition, do not use the Healthy Hair, you&#x27;ll regret it like I did.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a good shampoo, it just didn&#x27;t work for me the way I was hoping it would.</li>
      <li>I am using this product for more than a month now and my hairfall has reduced to much extent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this product would work for me, especially after reading some of the great reviews.</li>
      <li>my scalp looked nice, pink and healthy</li>
      <li>it combs through easily, I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s been almost 2 month since I started using this AMAZING  shampoo and the rotten smell I had in my hair is finally  gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I gave it about a weeks worth, and couldn&#x27;t take it anymore (inflamed, itchy, burning).  </li>
      <li>I suffer from Seborrheic Dermatitis (and adult acne) and also have a neurological/chronic pain/auto-immune condition RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy</li>
      <li>My hair was like straw and now its fuller and soft silky will be buying more and conditioner too.</li>
      <li>bought this for my husband, it worked right away....</li>
      <li>Never EVER right a review.</li>
      <li>Thick, nice lather, soothing, with a nice gentle scent.</li>
      <li>I like this shampoo very much, I use it in accordance with my \\&quot;Selsun Blue:Naturals.</li>
      <li>by far anti-fungal shampoo I have ever use, it leave your hair feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I researched this problem and discovered that it is most likely caused by a fungus we all have on our scalps.</li>
      <li>First time.</li>
      <li>The white spots are clearing up too, glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>This gave me relief the first time I tried it.</li>
      <li>I have used it for 2 weeks now, and the area is only slightly better.</li>
      <li>I have had scalp issues since elementary school, and my scalp began to smell about two years ago while I was going through a really stressful time at work.</li>
      <li>really impressive clean natural fragrance that is duly mighty effective in cutting down itchy scalp issues, dandruff buildup, and sebaceous dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it looked so clean and clear.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve continued to use it, since it leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
      <li>What a waste of good money, due to the fact that I deep sixed the Healthy Hair shampoo and conditioner!!  </li>
      <li>Very good shampoo for troubled hair</li>
      <li>I cannot say that this shampoo has really helped my issues.</li>
      <li>and it really didn&#x27;t help the problem..</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo for about two months now and it hasn&#x27;t really worked for me.</li>
      <li>It gently cleans my hair and I don&#x27;t have any dermalogical issues from using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month/ 3 times a week, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any real change.</li>
      <li>I could really tell the difference in my scalp...</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had time to fully try this out long enough but so far it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies and seems good for now.</li>
      <li>I had tried many other products and remedies, however, nothing worked.</li>
      <li>I use this shampoo regularly and it gets rid of the oil, keeps my scalp clean and even gives my hair some body.  </li>
      <li>I gave it four stars because I&#x27;ve had other things make my condition better at first, and then it comes back-and I&#x27;m naturally a skeptic.  </li>
      <li>It is very gentle, doesn&#x27;t lather  too well but leaves your hair soft.</li>
      <li>Makes my scalp less itchy, love it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and it did leave my hair soft but didn&#x27;t really address the problem I had with sores on my scalp.</li>
      <li>Nothing in ingredient list is much different than regular soap; i see nothing that would be effective enough to cure a fungal-ridden scalp.</li>
      <li>Plain old Head and Shoulders works better and is much cheaper</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a right fit for my dandruff problem.  </li>
      <li>I cannot afford to visit a derm right now, so over the years I&#x27;ve been trying various over-the-counter and natural healing methods.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s been about a month since I purchased the shampoo and FOR THE FIRST TIME my hair is growing back!!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m African American and we suffer from dandruff and fungus especially in the summer time, because we need more moisturizer&#x27;s and oil.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo has totally transformed my hair!!  No more scalp itch and the shine is more than ever before. Wish I could get it in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Never EVER right a review. First time. Suffered with a hair fungus for almost a year &amp; lost almost all of my hair. I paid almost 1000 going to dermatologist/medication/prescribed shampoos. Finally, tried something different..this. Before I use the shampoo, I spray tee tea oil &amp; apple cider vinegar(look up the benefits). I coat coconut oil on my entire scalp &amp; let everything sit for about an hour. I do this twice a week. Then I shampoo &amp; condition. (I use regular conditioner.) it&#x27;s been about a month since I purchased the shampoo and FOR THE FIRST TIME my hair is growing back!!!!! I have baby hairs everywhere! This is life changing for me being that I am a women. Loosing your hair from a stupid fungus is mortifying. This shampoo has been a blessing, thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. It does what it is supposed to, but also smells pretty nice to. The big surprise is how soft and silky it makes your hair.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo for troubled hair</li>
    <li> I like this product very much and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have problem with cyst on my scalp since I have been using the shampoo I have had no cyst</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to get rid of a horrible musty odor permeating from my hair when my head perspires. I researched this problem and discovered that it is most likely caused by a fungus we all have on our scalps. I had tried many other products and remedies, however, nothing worked. I found this shampoo on Amazon and decided to try it. It is FANTASTIC!!! My head and scalp never felt so clean! Goodbye to the horrible musty odor.</li>
    <li> Save your money, and buy a derma shampoo like Head and Shoulders, or my favorite is Aveeno nourish and dandruff free (no sodium sulfate) instead of this over priced harsh shampoo.  After the first use, my scalp became inflamed (red!).  I gave it about a weeks worth, and couldn&#x27;t take it anymore (inflamed, itchy, burning).  So I went back to using Aveeno the next day.  I found immediate results after I switched back to my Aveeno.  What a waste of good money, due to the fact that I deep sixed the Healthy Hair shampoo and conditioner!!  So if you have a real dermatitis scalp condition, do not use the Healthy Hair, you&#x27;ll regret it like I did.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all! I would give it zero but it didn&#x27;t let me. Waste of money. Do not buy</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really helping my condition, I have pimples and white things all over my scalp, and it is definitely reducing it. It is not a miracle, but it helps</li>
    <li> I just want to note that the customer service was great. There was a problem with my order, but they were very quick and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-length Asian hair that&#x27;s prone to get oily and smelly at the scalp, even on the same day as I shampoo. I hoped this product would help, but it didn&#x27;t. It made my hair quite dry, and it didn&#x27;t help my scalp problems at all. As another reviewer stated, I used Head&amp;Shoulders Clean and that worked a lot better compared to this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo when we were battling a fungal infection that affected my dog, my husband and myself.  It helped all three of us.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued to use it, since it leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Irritated my scalp after the second use, and by the third my reaction became severe. I&#x27;ve only ever reacted to one other shampoo like this which had tea tree oil in it. Took 4 days for my scalp to recover.</li>
    <li> This product I have been using for 2 months. The thing about this product I like is the Anti-Fungal solution that&#x27;s in it which block your scalp from getting bacterial fungus infections. I&#x27;m African American and we suffer from dandruff and fungus especially in the summer time, because we need more moisturizer&#x27;s and oil. This product helps to prevent that from happening because it blocks all that bacterial. I wear braids in the summer time and it is good to cleanse your scalp with this shampoo once every two weeks. Thank you</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product at all and it really didn&#x27;t help the problem.. I would request my money back on this item</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had time to fully try this out long enough but so far it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies and seems good for now. Will try to update this again later at its Anti Fungal properties.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo replacwnt over many other types of over-the-counter medicated antidandruff hair products, or, astringent paraben-free, hair clarifiers, which may be a healthy way of at ripping the hair of unwanted oiliness and scalp buildup. But often lacks the intended results for extensible scalp issues that do not combat these other sensitive areas for active individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really impressive clean natural fragrance that is duly mighty effective in cutting down itchy scalp issues, dandruff buildup, and sebaceous dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended over other drugstore or pharmacy over-the-counter hair products.</li>
    <li> It smells great and worked as advertised...very pleased</li>
    <li> Have been using it for several years now</li>
    <li> Found this to be a great product to ease scalp dryness and itch.  Product  provides good relief to itch. Shampoo has very pleasant fragrance</li>
    <li> I am loving this shampoo. My scalp was oily and had an odor as well as my hair. I could really smell it when I blow dried my hair. After using this shampoo, My scalp feels refreshed and clean, I have past shoulder length hair with hi lite&#x27;s It was always difficult to comb through after shampoo and conditioner, With the Healthy Hair shampoo it combs through easily, I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to all the skin problems this shampoo claims to help, however I bought it because my hair suddenly began to smell like mildew straight out of the shower. Fortunately the smell somewhat dissipated after blow drying it, but I could still smell mustiness. After googling it I realized it must be some sort of fungus. I ordered this shampoo and used it for 2 weeks, blow drying thoroughly after each use. I am glad to say that the smell is gone! I tested it today by using my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner and let it air dry. No smell!!!! So happy!</li>
    <li> I am giving this item 3 stars because I feel that it was &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  Sadly, it did not help me with my problem (smelly scalp and hair since youth) and actually seems to have made it worse during use.  Every hair product I buy or have been prescribed has not been able to prevent my head from stinking up the room.</li>
    <li> works in conjunction with other anti fungal products to keep my hair and skin scrupulously clean from head to toe.</li>
    <li> I had such itching of scalp and beard that it kept me awake at night. The dermatologist directed me to a shampoo that unfortunately has parabens. I needed something that kills fungus and the type of bacteria that causes itching and flaking. This gave me relief the first time I tried it.</li>
    <li> This is really nice - helps calm itchy scalp and makes your hair feel very clean and shiny.  Nice scent too.</li>
    <li> Makes my scalp less itchy, love it.</li>
    <li> I have head acne (or head bumps), and was hoping this product would help me with that, but it did not.  It did clean my hair, but that was all.</li>
    <li> I am trying to find something to help with an itchy scalp and decided to try it. Doesn&#x27;t help though and my stylist said I don&#x27;t need it, that if I had a fungal infection in my scalp she&#x27;d have told me. So I&#x27;m using it up but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Been using for a month now.  Definitely have seen a difference in my itchy scalp.  Leave on as long as possible in the shower.  Leaves my hair nice too!  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month/ 3 times a week, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any real change. Furthermore, the shampoo arrived with delay and in a damaged package (missing around 10 percent of the product messing the whole package).</li>
    <li> For Having problems with scalp problems for the las ten years. it seem to keep it undercontrol. And a wash my back since and have acne. it work there as well.. Yes to this product again.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair dry. No improvement in skin condition either. It reminds me of liquid hand soap. Nothing in ingredient list is much different than regular soap; i see nothing that would be effective enough to cure a fungal-ridden scalp. Hoped it would be effective because of higher price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three days now, and my scalp pimples are already noticeably better.  I&#x27;ve been battling the condition for three years now.  I cannot afford to visit a derm right now, so over the years I&#x27;ve been trying various over-the-counter and natural healing methods.  I gave it four stars because I&#x27;ve had other things make my condition better at first, and then it comes back-and I&#x27;m naturally a skeptic.  However, my scalp no longer itches, and redness is almost gone, making it MUCH less embarrassing with the pimples that were on my hairline.  If even for that fact, this product is so worth it!</li>
    <li> this is one of the Best! by far anti-fungal shampoo I have ever use, it leave your hair feeling fresh and clean. gets rid of dandruff. and smell great!</li>
    <li> Int and was hoping it would go away a</li>
    <li> I have had acne / dermatitis on the back of my neck and head for years, and this product has basically cured it.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Thick, nice lather, soothing, with a nice gentle scent.</li>
    <li> Still have dandruff after two usages.  Did not observe any improvement.  Figure it&#x27;s not a right fit for my dandruff problem.  Smell nice though.</li>
    <li> I have been having an annoying problem with scalp acne.  Searching the Internet, some have suggested that the cause may be a fungus, so I tried this.  Unfortunately, it did nothing for me.  Nice general-purpose shampoo, though.</li>
    <li> wow thers actually no ingreadiance ANYWHERE!!!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this product would work for me, especially after reading some of the great reviews. I have had scalp issues since elementary school, and my scalp began to smell about two years ago while I was going through a really stressful time at work. The clinical strength Head and Shoulders worked for me for a while, but it eventually stopped treating the smell. I have been using this shampoo for about two months now and it hasn&#x27;t really worked for me. I tried using it everyday, but it seemed to irritate my scalp if I used it too much. I have been using it every other day, and it keeps the smell away for about half a day and then it comes back. I am going to have to try something else. Overall, it is a good shampoo, it just didn&#x27;t work for me the way I was hoping it would.</li>
    <li> I had tried everything to get rid of my greasy, smelly scalp. Not sure if my problems are are a result of menopause and hormone changes. At any rate, after a couple of uses, I noticed a huge difference in my scalp and I can even miss a day of shampooing now without a problem. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks. I would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I started using the Healthy Hair Plus Anti-fungual shampoo along with TriDerma Intense Healing Cream and within two uses the improvement was amazing. I suffer from Seborrheic Dermatitis (and adult acne) and also have a neurological/chronic pain/auto-immune condition RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy aka CRPS (Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome) that affects the growth rate and texture of hair/skin/nails, and I have a long history of MRSA infections. I have been suffering with sores, bumps, scaling on my face, neck and especially my scalp. There was some hair loss, but I buzzed all my hair because it was further irratating things (as a female this is devestating). I have tried so many things, nothing helped. And after a flare, my scalp would be so sensitive and have open sores that even plain water would sting. THIS ACTUALLY SOOTHED MY SCALP. And the noticeable difference is a miracle. I would say I have a good 75percent healing rate. THIS WORKS MIRACLES FOR ME.</li>
    <li> This product is working for me. I already used for five months and I feel that the problem is under control.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband, it worked right away....but stopped working after using it for a couple of weeks. disappointing.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle.  This shampoo is fabulous!  I mix it with my other shampoo, so I get a customized salon effect.</li>
    <li> It did not work as promised.</li>
    <li> I could really tell the difference in my scalp...it looked so clean and clear.  my scalp looked nice, pink and healthy which is wha I am trying to achieve here.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> the antibacterial soaps worked better</li>
    <li> This product caused only a little improvement. I have used it for 2 weeks now, and the area is only slightly better.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo very much, I use it in accordance with my \\&quot;Selsun Blue:Naturals. I love them both for different&lt;br /&gt;reasons, the Selsun for the dandruff/the Healthy Hair, for the eczema! They both have an AWESOME smell! Will purchase another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I have some weird scalp thing going on, I have been on minocycline for 3 years but it still flares frequently....I cannot say that this shampoo has really helped my issues. But it does leave my hair feeling squeaky clean and the emu conditioner is nice and silky....</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been almost 2 month since I started using this AMAZING  shampoo and the rotten smell I had in my hair is finally  gone.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product 100% !!!</li>
    <li> My hair was like straw and now its fuller and soft silky will be buying more and conditioner too.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and it did leave my hair soft but didn&#x27;t really address the problem I had with sores on my scalp.</li>
    <li> So far its been good product for me. The itching of scalp has drastically reduced. As per me, this product may not cure the fungal infection completely but definetely minimises it. I am using this product for more than a month now and my hairfall has reduced to much extent.&lt;br /&gt;I would say, yes give it a try. Its definelty worth it. :)</li>
    <li> Not sure if it worked for fungus.&lt;br /&gt;But my hair felt softer the next day</li>
    <li> Stopped the Itching in my head the same day. The white spots are clearing up too, glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> The reason I give this only three stars is that it didn&#x27;t work for me, but the customer service deserves five stars.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It gently cleans my hair and I don&#x27;t have any dermalogical issues from using it.</li>
    <li> My scalp always smell bad even when i religiously wash my hair. I did some research and found out i have fungal problem, so i turned to this shampoo. It is very gentle, doesn&#x27;t lather  too well but leaves your hair soft. I eventually figured that i need to get medication from my doctor because this is not enough to solve the problem.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo.  I use it every two days.  So far my scalp feels good for one day, maybe two, and then the itching starts again.  I&#x27;m hoping by the time I get to the bottom of the bottle, my scalp will stay relieved.  If it does, I will order another bottle.  From what I&#x27;ve read about itchy scalp problems, some recommend using Listerine after rinsing shampoo out.  I tried it, and my scalp felt wonderful for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Have been battling sores and itching scalp for nearly 20 years.  I will not say I am &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; but this product has definitely reduced the itching and the number of sores.  Would (and will shortly) buy another bottle!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good but did nothing to help my scalp. Instead it inflamed it even more and caused it to itch and burn. Plain old Head and Shoulders works better and is much cheaper</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo after learning that my summer scalp itch might be due to fungus caused by increased humidity and sweat.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues since using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have long, fine, sometimes oily hair and also suffer from candida which seems to cause extra buildup on my scalp.  I use this shampoo regularly and it gets rid of the oil, keeps my scalp clean and even gives my hair some body.  I follow with a moisturizing conditioner from Andalou Naturals.  The combination of the Healthy Hair Plus Shampoo and Andalou Naturals Conditioner works great for me!</li>
