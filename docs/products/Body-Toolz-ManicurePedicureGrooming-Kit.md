    <li> I found this manicure set very useful for both men and women. I gave it several times to both men and women and got rave reviews.</li>
    <li> This is my second set that I purchased from this company. The first one was a gift to my husband and once we got it, I like it so much that I am getting one for my dad. The tools are very sturdy and very sharp. I love the convienience of the case. The toenail clippers (big ones) are $25 at my walgreens so getting the entire set for $40 bucks is a steal!  I had no problems with my first order but my second one came with two of the same clippers (the ones in the middle). Since christmas is this weekend, I am going to wait until after my dad opens it to see if he want to exchange them.</li>
