      <li>Def going to buy more</li>
      <li>I love this hair extension.</li>
      <li>I want more can&#x27;t find them anywhere 😔</li>
      <li>but i had to chop most of it off because of tangles.</li>
      <li>and i should order three more</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;ll have  to order one more for my hair.</li>
      <li>I would def check it out and recommend a purchase because for the value it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>and this would be easy to change whenever i wanted</li>
      <li>cuz it dosent blend easily to my hair.</li>
      <li>recommend these to someone who wants to try clip in hair extensions since they are pretty great to play around with.</li>
      <li>First of all, I would like to say these extensions hold up pretty good for $6 and free shipping.</li>
      <li>I recived this Hair extentions i only needed them for a day and they were great</li>
      <li>but what else for something so cheap</li>
      <li>The hair is Easy to maintain and full.  </li>
      <li>Anyways these extensions did take forever to come, but I was pretty pleased with the &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; of the hair, and when I say quality it is based on the fact that these cost me around $5 plus shipping.</li>
      <li>I love it so much and it</li>
      <li>Overall there good.</li>
      <li>Full of fiber, don&#x27;t look like the picture.</li>
      <li>great price for an awesome product, if you do get knot in it, which isn&#x27;t hard, wash with fabric softener, and lay flat or hang to dry,... you can comb gently while still in softner/ conditioner mix.. be gentle, and start from the bottom, section by section,  good luck!</li>
      <li>these hair extensions are really useful it covered my full head.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for !</li>
      <li>The hair was very shiny and cheap looking.</li>
      <li>but yet you know they will be worth your money...</li>
      <li>it is soft and long and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  worth the price though.</li>
      <li>but it was worth it.</li>
      <li>It was worth the money.</li>
      <li>, their soft ,really soft, shinny, bouncy and the ends are great, overall a great product the color is amazing, seriously will buy again</li>
      <li>does look realistic, but the shine was slightly more intense than I thought it would have.</li>
      <li>This hair extension was not the right color nor could we figure out how to keep them in.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering another pair right now</li>
      <li>hair was falling off of them almost right away.</li>
      <li>The ends fry pretty fast &amp; whenever you wear it, it gets tangled pretty easily,</li>
      <li>good: very long (18-20 inches), extremely soft, silky, doesn&#x27;t tangle, strong clips, very secure.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better to buy the real human hair extentions that are a bit pricy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>will order more in the future.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>will order more in the future!</li>
      <li>for synthetic hair, it looks pretty damn real!</li>
      <li>So I got mine last night in the mail, was super excited.</li>
      <li>They work nice, but mine Is like a dark brown</li>
      <li>i got black, and they came the perfect color pitch black.</li>
      <li>Tried many times but they just kept slipping out.</li>
      <li>they do tangle but not as much as they shed.</li>
      <li>it looks so real.</li>
      <li>they shed too much.</li>
      <li>Oh did I mention the fast shipping?</li>
      <li>They are shiny and it doesn&#x27;t really blend with my hair.</li>
      <li>It is shinier than natural hair, but for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>i just gently comb it&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
      <li>The hair gets messed up way to fast</li>
      <li>they get tangled easy, but i don&#x27;t mind, all long hair does anyways.</li>
      <li>there are 5 black clips, nicely sewn on already, and they&#x27;re so soft!</li>
      <li>I got real human hair and these extensions felt more like human hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super long and really really shiny.</li>
      <li>Was a little more shiny than I expected, but not a bad piece really.</li>
      <li>took super long to get here but the hair is soo soft!</li>
      <li>Very soft.</li>
      <li>This rating is about how very soft and silky this product is, not about the shipping.</li>
      <li>it totally doesnt blend with your hair and it tangles too much -.-</li>
      <li>got it early.</li>
      <li>it was amazingly soft and silky</li>
      <li>Soft n looks real.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i guess you&#x27;d need to straighten them back if you want it straight again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, If you have THICK hair, you will need TWO of these not one :)</li>
      <li>The color was Jet black and had the clip on for quick install.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recived this Hair extentions i only needed them for a day and they were great i would defenetly order again.</li>
    <li> I liked it. It was worth the money. I would def check it out and recommend a purchase because for the value it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super long and really really shiny. Very soft. Not too thin and not too thick. Might end up getting another one just because I like it.</li>
    <li> The hair looks fake... I did everything to try to get the hair to look better but nothing... I ended up useing it on a doll so it wouldn&#x27;t just sit there... so not even worth the little i paid for it...</li>
    <li> I had recently chopped my precious locks due to stress, and after this treacherous incident I was finding a way to get my long locks back. I was looking for extentions that didn&#x27;t break my bank account, but also that didn&#x27;t look fake. Anyways these extensions did take forever to come, but I was pretty pleased with the &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; of the hair, and when I say quality it is based on the fact that these cost me around $5 plus shipping. I would def. recommend these to someone who wants to try clip in hair extensions since they are pretty great to play around with. The only thing I recommend is that you buy more than one pair of clip since it only comes with one pair of five clip, and for someone who has very thick hair one of these won&#x27;t be enough.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it came QUICK.&lt;br /&gt;However, If you have THICK hair, you will need TWO of these not one :)&lt;br /&gt;I promise It looks like real human hair, and It even feels like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps for those who want a easy way of applying one weft of hair.&lt;br /&gt;So worth it!!!</li>
    <li> i love this. it looks so real. packaging was a lil weird. butgood. got it early. the length  is amazing I love it so much and it</li>
    <li> I ordered them a month and a half ago where are they? I needed them last weekend and I STILL DO NOT HAVE THEM</li>
    <li> Way too tangling and difficult to comb without all the hair coming off. May I add that it is way to fake looking so people will notice that you are wearing fake hair.. arrgghhh you get what you pay for... Better to buy the real human hair extentions that are a bit pricy but yet you know they will be worth your money...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly like the picture. The ends fry pretty fast &amp; whenever you wear it, it gets tangled pretty easily, but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> these were way longer then i was expecting. and really thin. hair was falling off of them almost right away. not impressed.</li>
    <li> I can not rate the hair I did not get it yet still waiting on it NOT HAPPY AT ALL</li>
    <li> The color was Jet black and had the clip on for quick install. It was very easy to put in.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality :) will shop again!!!! and it&#x27;s definitely more for your buck! Just love them!! Get yours</li>
    <li> Good quality and just in time. The problem is that it isn&#x27;t completely black as I ordered it, it&#x27;s most like a dark brown color.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not human hair.. I didn&#x27;t get the right color I ordered black and got brown.. but for 5 bucks whatever but I wasn&#x27;t very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Seriously i just got these today and at first i was skeptical but omg these things are beautiful I&#x27;m ordering another pair right now, their soft ,really soft, shinny, bouncy and the ends are great, overall a great product the color is amazing, seriously will buy again</li>
    <li> First of all, I would like to say these extensions hold up pretty good for $6 and free shipping. I&#x27;ve had them for a couple of weeks. Oh did I mention the fast shipping? I&#x27;m in the US and it took about 2 weeks to get here. They are shiny and it doesn&#x27;t really blend with my hair. I tried using baby powder but it didn&#x27;t do any good and turned the extensions gray. Maybe its just with black extensions that baby powder doesn&#x27;t work with. I dont think I&#x27;ll be wearing them out to public since my hairs a little thicker than these and they&#x27;re too shiny. If anyones wondering, I did try to curl these with VERY low heat and they did curl but you need to curl in tiny tiny sections, so that&#x27;s the problem with curling them. You&#x27;d literally spend hours curling every piece. I tried washing them but the curls stayed..i guess you&#x27;d need to straighten them back if you want it straight again. Did I mention they shed a lot? Every time I ran my fingers through them they would shed hairballs out..they do tangle but not as much as they shed. That&#x27;s another problem with wearing them out..they shed too much. Anyway to sum this up they are pretty long but wouldn&#x27;t suit everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Full of fiber, don&#x27;t look like the picture. The color is off. Black is a number 2 in color. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> great price for an awesome product, if you do get knot in it, which isn&#x27;t hard, wash with fabric softener, and lay flat or hang to dry,... you can comb gently while still in softner/ conditioner mix.. be gentle, and start from the bottom, section by section,  good luck!</li>
    <li> I love this hair extension. Soft n looks real.&lt;br /&gt;I will order more in the future.  The price is great &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like this product couse the hair is horrible is the worst hair extensions i ever try... never again</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for everybody. This rating is about how very soft and silky this product is, not about the shipping. Although it came really late, I like that  it was amazingly soft and silky these hair extensions are really useful it covered my full head. This product is so great, I thought it was human hair, although it was not. I really felt terrible when I lost it. This thing will surprise you, I got real human hair and these extensions felt more like human hair. I washed the human hair and then it started falling off . Truly I did not brush this hair but I went through a lot with these extensions and no hair fell off, so I really love these extensions, and I suggest them to all people.</li>
    <li> I just received my hair,i love it. Came in the color i wanted. The hair is actually thicker than i thought but i&#x27;ll have  to order one more for my hair. Tangles the like any hair i just gently comb it&lt;br /&gt;Hair doesn&#x27;t fall out. I was worried after reading other reviews but im very satisfied with my product.</li>
    <li> These will add length but if you want your hair to still look thick, you will definitely need to pick up a few of these guys.</li>
    <li> They work nice, but mine Is like a dark brown</li>
    <li> Good Quality Hair.  The hair is Easy to maintain and full.  The color was good. I recommend this wig .</li>
    <li> This hair extension was not the right color nor could we figure out how to keep them in.  Tried many times but they just kept slipping out.</li>
    <li> Overall there good. There thick enough and the right color and the length but it&#x27;s not real hair so I can&#x27;t put any heat on them so I can&#x27;t wear them when I curl or crimp my hair :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice and flows perfectly. However it sheds a lot. It&#x27;s  worth the price though. I somewhat like it</li>
    <li> So I got mine last night in the mail, was super excited. Only took a week and a half, to come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I ordered black)&lt;br /&gt;The good: very long (18-20 inches), extremely soft, silky, doesn&#x27;t tangle, strong clips, very secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: VERY thin, if you have thick hair, get 2-3 of these. Color is NOT black. It&#x27;s a dark brown. Which sucks because my hair is jet black so you can see the difference. I can only wear it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m happy with the product, it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money, so you get what you pay for. Not too bad.</li>
    <li> took super long to get here but the hair is soo soft! the hair is a little to shiny though! its very nice and the clips stay . will order more in the future! GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> The hair was very shiny and cheap looking.</li>
    <li> So disappointed,  they get tangled so easily. Its fake care so cheap, I guess you get what you pay fir but would not recommend it</li>
    <li> My package came and the hair is so soft and long!! It&#x27;s one clip in extention. And I love it!! Def going to buy more</li>
    <li> Was a little more shiny than I expected, but not a bad piece really. Arrived faster than I thought it would and it clips in well, but the way it was folded in the package required some work to straighten it before it would lie down flat. This is a very long piece as well; I had to trim it a bit to hit at shoulder length to match the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does look realistic, but the shine was slightly more intense than I thought it would have.</li>
    <li> just got these in the mail yesterday, i waited about a month as expected but it was worth it. i got black, and they came the perfect color pitch black. there are 5 black clips, nicely sewn on already, and they&#x27;re so soft! really long too! they get tangled easy, but i don&#x27;t mind, all long hair does anyways. for synthetic hair, it looks pretty damn real! great product!</li>
    <li> I must have read this wrong because it says 8 color 23\\&quot; I thought I was going to get 8 of the hair extensions. But I got my one and it is black it is soft and long and beautiful. Just a bit shiny. But my mom loved it for her. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Loved it ! For the price I can not complain! The extensions were great for the price ! Exactly what I was looking for !</li>
    <li> I dint like it i thought it had way more hair and it was thicker but no and the hair falls off very easily no really a big fan and i should order three more cuz it dosent blend easily to my hair.</li>
    <li> This is another item i ordered and did not receive:( i was soooo excited for this because i have short cut hair which i love but sometimes i like a change and this would be easy to change whenever i wanted.. contacted the seller and by the next day my refund had cleared.over a month no wig:(</li>
    <li> I bought this for added length, and cut it to a desirable length for me. It is shinier than natural hair, but for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I didnt like these one bit. Horrible dont buy. The hair gets messed up way to fast and you can&#x27;t brush them out . Horrible horrible horrible.</li>
    <li> Very ugly hair. Super thin. Hair falls out. I hope no one else buys these. Its not worth a cent</li>
    <li> It was long but i had to chop most of it off because of tangles. And extensive wear cause it to have massive split ends. The clips keeps falling off to so i have to constantly resew it. I think i am going to throw this away...</li>
    <li> One piece extensions do not work for me because  my hair is red and not black but they were good as they were no use to me</li>
    <li> Ugly extentions omg this are just horrible you cant do nothing with them ! Plus it looks too shiny it totally doesnt blend with your hair and it tangles too much -.- never buying something like this again!</li>
    <li> I ordered black and they gave me a light brown color I was very disappointed with it but what else for something so cheap I got them for my little cousin who wanted some</li>
    <li> I want more can&#x27;t find them anywhere 😔</li>
