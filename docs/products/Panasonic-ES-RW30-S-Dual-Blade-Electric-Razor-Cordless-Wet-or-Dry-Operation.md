<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good value. Adequate shave, not quite as close as would like without going over a second or more times. Should  have included travel case or bag or option for same.</li>
    <li> Lousy. Didnt cut anything!</li>
    <li> Great electric razor , work as expected</li>
    <li> It is sturdy and doing the job fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to anyone who has less beard than normal.</li>
    <li> Gives an outstanding wet / shave.  Use a thin layer of shaving cream ; and you will get a super close shave !!!!</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-RW30-S claims to be both a wet and a dry shaver. when i received the shaver I had about four days of growth and decided it would be a perfect opprutunity to test it out. I normally dry shave and like to have a cordless razor so that I can shave on my way to work. I found out rather quickly that when it comes to dry shaving this product is sub-par. It took several passes over the same area and still ended up using a regualr razor to clean up what it missed. I was about to return to the product but decided to give it one more chance this time in the shower and using my body soap. The shaver was suberb. It provided a very close comfortable shave and I did not need to go over the same spots multiple times. If your looking for a shaver to use while your taking a shower this is a great product and it very affordable, but if a dry shaver or dual shaver is what you need you&#x27;ll need to shell out a bit more for a better product. I can give it five stars due to the fact that I orginally wanted a dry shaver and its performance in that aspect was horrible. I have decided to keep it and just take about two or three more minutes every morning getting ready.</li>
    <li> My old shaver served me well for three decades and when its battery died, I went to the same manufacturer for replacement of the shaver. I was not disappointed with my new shaver - it&#x27;s even better in performance and comfort with a slick new form that&#x27;s easy to navigate around the crags and wrinkles of my old face. It&#x27;s good to get help from my favorite seller too.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to do. The shave is close and comfortable.  It is nothing fancy which is what I prefer.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my husband. Not having a reason to use one of these myself, and never having bought one before, I was happy that I made a good choice, since my husband loves it ans uses it regularly.</li>
    <li> Been using the ES4026 for years and replacing blades but saw it was no longer available. At first I was reluctant to purchase RW30, but did so and was very pleased with my first shave with it.  I&#x27;m getting a closer shave with less irritation.  I like the floating head and that it uses the same blades as the 4026.</li>
    <li> Wh en I need a real close shave I use a Gillette razor.  Nowadays they stay sharp for months.  When I don&#x27;t need a really close shave, I use this razor, which is fun to use.</li>
    <li> It shave very closed. I use it for travel only, but feel shaving better than the one at home cost almost 4 times more ! May be if I use it everyday will have a different story.</li>
    <li> Good quality razor from a good company. This is only the latest purchase of a long row of Panasonic products that I have purchased, and I have not been disappointed. It is not a high-end machine, but it gets the job done, effectively and at a great price.</li>
    <li> pure crap... do not buy.  the shaving surface area is miniscule.. perhaps if a toddler needed to shave, you would buy this for him. for adults, the shaving area is way too small.  shame on you panasonic!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately Panasonic stopped making the single blade razor that I&#x27;ve used for 20 years. (I bought 6 of them)  So, I HAD one good blade and one good trimmer on the single blade shavers from the past.  This unit instead has two BAD blades and a poor trimmer.  I am using it because without spending a lot more, I don&#x27;t think anything else is any better, but do I like this product...NO!  Update: 2015  I have come to terms with this product, and am now getting a little better service.  It seems well made, it&#x27;s NOT as good as my single blade models that they don&#x27;t make anymore, BUT it will do the job, although in more time than it took with the old one.  New thinking on this...it&#x27;s acceptable!  If anyone knows of a single blade shaver like the old Panasonic, I would appreciate knowing about it.  My email is Jeff@TheJingleHouse.com.</li>
    <li> work good for a cheap razor</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was hoping. I was thinking this could make getting ready in the mornings quicker and I&#x27;d get just as smooth shave as I did with my traditional razor. Unfortunately, it takes me just as long to shave with the electric razor as it did with my old-fashioned razor because the electric razor doesn&#x27;t get all the stubbles the 1st time around so I keep having to go back multiple times and even then it doesn&#x27;t always get them all. It&#x27;s even worse along the bottom of my chin where it meets my neck. I really have to work it in there to get all of the stubble.</li>
    <li> Works great.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34; after all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor regularly for a few months now. This is my first electric razor, but it definitely does the job for me. I shave daily (usually dry because I&#x27;m always in a hurry) and my face does not get irritated (I also apply a face lotion after). It&#x27;s very easy to clean, and the battery lasts longer than expected (I can sometimes go over a week without charging). I just wish it included some sort of battery indicator, as there is no way to tell when it needs to be charged or when it is done charging. Overall, this is a pretty good buy, for convenience and comfort.</li>
    <li> it works very well for a good price</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Poor quality of getting of the beard !</li>
    <li> I use it mainly for the trimmer which I only use occasionally.  Battery charge keeps for a month.  I replaced a indentical product I purchased 6 years ago.  Device worked but battery gave out.  Was inexpensive and serves my limited purpose.</li>
    <li> It exceeded all my expectations. I have bought many of this type of shaver to throw them out after few months.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a very close shave ( I use dry powder ). It feels stronger and more powerful than it looks like.&lt;br /&gt;Really easy to clean also. I just love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, nothing fancy. Good for the price. Consider a pre-shave powder so you don&#x27;t tear up your face.</li>
    <li> The shaver is good and I have no complaints but the power supply is horrible design. First its huge and bulky. second its not connecting with a cable but rather plugs in to the outlet and the shaver sits in in in a socket. This is not going to be a long lasting design and it puts stress on the wall outlet every time you need to charge the shaver or you have to unplug it and connect the shaver than plug it in. Very dumb design. But wait the worst it is only 120V!!!!! Who makes a shaver, that is designed to be portable, only single voltage and no universal. This is the worst feature of this shaver. I generally love Panasonic products but I am seriously disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver, especially for the price. It is simple, easy to clean, and dry shaves quite well, which for me includes needing to shave my head. I don&#x27;t have thick coarse hair, but I doubt that would make much difference. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower so I can&#x27;t say how it works when wet. It plugs directly into the charger which plugs into a wall socket, so that, depending on the wall socket, the shaver may be vertical or horizontal when it is charging. There is no extension cord or anything like that.</li>
    <li> Love this razor!! Awesome for the money! Panasonic quality at a bargain price!</li>
    <li> Charge last long. Great shave. Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> When I bought this razor, I felt confident that it would be a quality product, because I&#x27;ve come to expect that from other Panasonic purchases.  Not so much with this razor.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, at all.  Yet, this razor does a marginal job of shaving.  I can start with a clean shaving head; shave my face for five minutes, and I still have hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> It worked very nicely for the first few weeks, but now i&#x27;m just not even getting that close of a shave as it used to give. Also it cut me just this morning without my realizing it till I went to the bathroom to look in a mirror. It&#x27;s not a bad product but I just sort of feel this is going to make me eventually just switch back to disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Bought this during Black Friday Holiday for about $22.  The razor is subpar but for the low price I guess the expectations cannot be high.  As other buyers have mentioned it does not give you a clean close shave.  I can still feel stubbles afterwards.  Works best for people with little to medium facial hair and on a daily use.  If you let your beard grow for more than 3 days, it won&#x27;t do a good job.  If you have a lot of facial hair, then this razor is NOT for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing about this razor is that it&#x27;s waterproof but I don&#x27;t usually shave in the shower.  Bad thing is the power cradle.  You cannot charge and shave at the same time.  So if the power dies and your in the middle of a shave, you&#x27;ll have to wait for the charge or use a blade.  It does not have quick charge either.  Manual suggest 15 hour charge for about 20 - 25 minutes of power (7 shaves in 3 minute intervals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t recommend this razor unless you&#x27;re on a budget.  I would probably spend a little more to get a better shave.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why a manufacturer has to stop manufacturing a product that is wonderful.  I miss the model this one replaced.</li>
    <li> I would recommend to anyone. Only problem I had is that it doesn&#x27;t go into slow down mode so you know you need to charge it. It just stops. Have already ordered replacement blade and foil for future needs.</li>
    <li> You really have shave slow. It&#x27;s just slow to get every whisker.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the wet shave yet, but the dry shave leaves disappointing results--unless you shave everyday.  A 3-day plus growth is too much for the cutting blade...you could deplete the battery trying to capture every whisker.</li>
    <li> Good razor for the money, but does occasionally miss longer face hairs. I probably will upgrade to the next level razor for my next purchase. I&#x27;ve owned Panasonic razors for years, and it&#x27;s the only electric razor I&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
    <li> Rotating blades are faster.  This leaves beard behind unless done over and over.  Cutting ability cheap quality.  Cost low but at least the one I got seemed dull.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. Holds the charge for what seems like months, easy to clean, and is solid. The only thing is that your beard has be be at most a 5 o&#x27; clock shadow for it to cut it. But when its short enough, it cuts closer than a razor.</li>
    <li> I GUESS THE EASY&#x27;S WAY TO PUT IT THAT IT DOES NOT WORK</li>
    <li> its just okay for the price - its not near as good as their pricey models.... takes me a lot longer to shave with this unit...</li>
    <li> My fiance had the previous version of this razor and it finally was not holding a charge at all.  He is really enjoying this razor and said that it works really well.</li>
    <li> it does not shave my under arms or legs</li>
    <li> I bought this one because I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement charger for my previous razor. I still have it because it has lasted almost two years on a charge! True I only shave once every 2 or 3 days, but you can&#x27;t deny the fact the charge lasted 20 months!</li>
    <li> Works good good size&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as a manual shaver but very essy to clean and shaves very good</li>
    <li> Not the best shaver. Clearly does not work for my facial hair. I have spent almost an hour shaving and still the shaver does not do the job. Worst shaver ever</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES RW30 razor is not as comfortable to use nor as effective as the ES SA40 single blade razor it replaced. It is much quieter in operation, but the double-blade system does not do as good a job dry shaving as the older single blade version. Otherwise, it seems to be about the same in construction, and fortunately it&#x27;s almost as inexpensive as its predecessor.</li>
    <li> It gives a very close shave if used everyday BUT it doesn&#x27;t always shave long whiskers since it has only two cutting heads. Previously, I used a three-head Panasonic with a head for long whiskers in the middle, and no problem. Fortunately, I saved this razor which I replaced it because it no longer gave close shaves. Now, when the new two-head shaver has missed too many long whiskers, I follow it with the three head shaver. This happens about twice a week.</li>
    <li> Sucks no matter how you use it. It also pulls hair. The only close shave I will ever get is with a straight edge razor I guess.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Does good job. East to clean.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I love it, it shaves close, the trimmer works well (as opposed to my previous Braun), it has a protective foil cover that easily snaps on for protection, its easy to clean, and it holds a charge longer than I&#x27;ve ever needed, it&#x27;s small, lightweight, easy to pack, and works great !&lt;br /&gt;  My only criticism is the charging stand. It is designed to plug directly into a wall outlet which may work fine for 99% of users. But, this was particularly problematic for me in the Chicago area where the duplex outlets are all positioned sideways (go figure).  I easily solved the problem by using (actually making) a short 18&amp;#34; extension cord and then simply resting the charging base on the counter top where it stands steadily. It would be nice if Panasonic could provide such a cord for those who prefer not to &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; their charger and razor on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;  If this is not a problem for you, then give the razor 6 stars.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Does not really shave very close at all.  Plus, the actual cutting head inside is much smaller than the outside, so it does not shave the width of the razor.</li>
    <li> Best wet/dry razor for the money.  There&#x27;s far more expensive units out there and they may, perhaps, work a bit better but this one works the best for the money.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Panasonic Shaver I&#x27;ve used but the only reason is my reluctance to pay much more for other shavers,  The Panasonic shaver is as good as one can expect given its price but it doesn&#x27;t really cut that close.  Have never tried using the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feature so can&#x27;t comment on how well that works.  As it&#x27;s rated by me....it&#x27;s okay.... nothing to get excited over.</li>
    <li> I need a shaver that doesn&#x27;t irritate the area around my neck as my current Norelco and, to a lesser extent, my Remington do.  This Panasonic causes me no irritation at all.  In addition it has a fairly quiet hum compared to the much louder Remington and is more comparable to the Norelco in this respect.  I like the small overall size and the light weight of the unit.  It cleans up nicely under a faucet.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a larger head which is small and requires a longer time to shave.  As others have indicated, it does not do a good job on longer rogue whiskers.  I look for a long life shaver, unlike my old Braun unit whose battery failed in less than 3 years and was not even replaceable.  I won&#x27;t buy that brand again.  I have not used the Panasonic very long so I cannot comment on its reliability or its useful life.  Since I don&#x27;t really need a cordless shaver I would prefer a unit similar to my corded Norelco unit but there is not a big selection of corded units in the marketplace.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered this I had been using a Norelco Body Groom.  The Norelco was definitely more designed for body hair than facial hair, but it worked nicely.  Until I lost the charger in a move.  I ordered this one because it was about the same price as the Norelco and like the Norelco it was waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very quick, and it came in a box with a solid amount of air pocket packing.  It helps that I live in Nevada where Amazon operates many of their distribution warehouses.  When I opened the package, the first thing that I noticed was there was no cord.  The charger is a base with the two wall outlet plugs protruding from the back.  It is meant to be plugged directly into the wall and the device sits firmly in the base with friction for retention.  So, keep this charging situation in mind if you don&#x27;t have an outlet that will accommodate the razor sticking straight up out of it about three inches off the wall.  The razor itself has a nice weight to it for a device in this price point.  It obviously isn&#x27;t as robust as a $150 self-cleaner, but it doesn&#x27;t feel that cheap either.  I probably would have spent 50-100% more on this and have been satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am lucky that I don&#x27;t grow that much facial hair, and what does appear is light in color and I can pass it off with out looking too scruffy.  I had let it get to a point, though, that I was beginning to look quite ridiculous.  I kept countering my SO&#x27;s aversion with the excuse that I was waiting for this to arrive to give it a good testing.  My mustache and beard were about one, maybe two shaves longer than my neck and face.  The longer parts were approximately a half inch.  The flip out trimmer on the back handled the shorter and softer hair on my cheeks with minimal complaint.  I then ran over the remainder twice with the foils.  It ate it up no problem and gave me a shave only slightly courser than a Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neck gave up more of a fight than my cheeks, but ultimately wasnot a huge issue.  You have to go slowly as the trimmer will not keep up and pull more than cut.  It was easy enough to adjust my method, although I missed the hedge trimmer efficiency of the Norelco.  The weakness of the trimmer was even more pronounced when I hit the beard.  I ended up trimming with scissors to lessen the load on the trimmer.  Once I cut it down to the lowest point I could with the scissors, the trimmer handled it satisfactorily.  Once the beard was gone, the foils brought it down to baby butt smooth very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did, however, take out my molestache with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy for $25.  It is apparent that I will have to shave regularly to enjoy quick shaves, but it will do daily shaving no problem.  It is obviously meant for facial hair, maybe regular leg, arm, and pit hair, but I would avoid the courser hair of the chest, stomach, or pubic areas.  For that, the Norelco would be superior.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had one before and it was slick. The charger that came with it doesn&#x27;t work. I used the thing a few times until the battery ran out and then had to throw it away. I didn&#x27;t keep any of the stuff it came with because it was working so I knew sending it back wouldn&#x27;t work. Thanks for the crappy charger. What good is a car that has no gas tank? What good is an electric razor that has no battery recharger?</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers most of my life,includining Panasonic.But this one is just better than a one use you&#x27;d buy at the .99 store.</li>
    <li> The trimmer on the side does not work as well as my former remmington electric razor i had used for 5-10 years. Its a bit shorter in width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery is good, main shaver heads are good. I am hoping it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the third electric razor I used but this one is the smoothest, no pain at all, and very silent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. it is a piece of crap!</li>
    <li> I was looking for the replacement blades for my Panasonic. This uses the same blade and cheaper than replacement blades. Why not buying?</li>
    <li> Best price with quality</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Panasonic Shavers. I have been purchasing them for 12+ years. This is the absolute worst razor they have ever made. I purchased this model over a year ago. I&#x27;m no expert, but I think something is wrong with the motor inside these shavers. While you&#x27;re shaving, the cutter block slows down immensely, and at times almost comes to a complete stop. Figuring I had a dud, I purchased a second one. It has the exact same issue. Save your money and buy an upgraded model. There&#x27;s a reason this is the cheapest Panasonic model on Amazon.</li>
    <li> As several others have noted, this razor does not do well with longer hairs.  In my experience over ~0.5mm or if I skip a day.  You can spend 10 minutes going over and over the same spot and you will still be riddled with missed hairs.  I think the holes are just too small.  The Norelco with rotary heads that I used previously did not have this problem at all.  I&#x27;ve been using this three months now and I keep a reel razor next to it to cut off the stray hairs.  I&#x27;d give it one star but then I&#x27;d feel even dumber for being too cheap to replace it...</li>
    <li> Performma as expected for the price</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this razor.  I can spend 15 minutes and still not get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> just didn&#x27;t do the job</li>
    <li> Short and sweet:  This lacks the center cutter, which, it turns out, is very important for cutting the hairs that are long enough to lie back down on your skin.  Those longer hairs will simply not get cut by this shaver unless you pick them up and insert them into the foil yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This never occurred to me, as I&#x27;m a long-time Panasonic shaver user, so naturally I expected this one to be at least a little better with a two-day growth.  It performs well if you shave every day, but if you happen to miss the same hair a couple of days in a row, then it will never get it after it grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using this, and I&#x27;m back to the version with the center blade.  That one works like a champ.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  It is compact, fits the hand perfectly and gives a good close shave.  Did I mention the great low price.</li>
    <li> Good performing shaver.  Holds a charge for a long time.  Still not as close of a shave as a blade but pretty good... And for less than $30... I don&#x27;t mind shaving with this unit a couple times a day ...</li>
    <li> es un equipo que puede ser utilizado con agua y espuma es lo mas facinante por lo que me parecio diferente y el adecuado para mi</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know way any one wood say this is not a good razor it is a good one for what you pay</li>
    <li> husband love&#x27;s it and im happy also due to the fact I saved some money quality guaranteed plug&#x27;s in perfectly and there&#x27;s no cord all in the way lol</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shaver just to get the fuzz off my face every couple of days (retired), but didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 for one.&lt;br /&gt;Had a Panasonic years ago that worked well, so when I spotted this one I went for it. It was just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an earlier model Panasonic, where this on does just as good or better job of shaving I don&#x27;t like the Trimmer it just doesn&#x27;t work for people who have beards. I still use my old one for trimming.</li>
    <li> No frills electric shaver just what I needed without dropping a load of cash! Recommend to all who want a no nonsense electric shaver.</li>
    <li> There is no cord.  The heads are a little light weight compared to my corded 1988 Braun that is just starting to go on the blink  after 25 years of service.  The Panasonic is new and cutting ok, but it does not feel like a heavy duty shaver that will last a long time.  I have been looking for a corded shaver without a rechargeable battery, but  I think the manufacturers all decided to stop making them because they just keep on working.</li>
    <li> It was a good price for a young shaver. It does the job but not that close nor so comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver for my son.  The cost of the shaver is the same as a replacement set of blades.  When it gets dull you buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever owned and figured I would never be happy with one but this shave is great to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> First time I could get a good shave with an electric razor,wet or dry.  Good product. Would recommend. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Shaving (on everydy basis) when beard is very short is fine. Cutter when unshaved approx. 1 week doesn&#x27;t fly. Pulls hairs.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut right. I have to go over my face four times and still see whiskers. The instructions say to give it 15 hours to charge. Then when I use it, the shaver runs out of juice quickly. A waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this. It works perfectly for both wet and dry shaving. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a cheap electric razor.</li>
    <li> Love this razor but the battery died after a few months</li>
    <li> Has to be fully charged to the top to do anything. is really weak and you can&#x27;t hear the power unless you do.&lt;br /&gt;I used this wet and dry. in shower and not. I tried it on every body part you can think of. it does nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has one of these (the female version) and the electric razor works wonders for her. My hair is thicker than hers. Doesn&#x27;t matter where I run this think or how much pressure I apply... the electric razor just wont cut. at all. no matter how long or short my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will just use a razor blade for now. geesh</li>
    <li> This is a great rechargeable shaver, the pop-up trimmer is really good and the 2 blades with flexible pivoting heads is excelent for close shave that follows all the contour of your face, is a wet/dry shaver, washable, shaves either wet or dry in the shower or with any shaving foam and really easy to wash. Not like the charging time of 15 Hrs and the durability of the Li-Ion battery of 21 Mins fully charged. If battery life is not a problem then this is your first shaver to consider.</li>
    <li> For the money you can&#x27;t beat this shaver. I wouldn&#x27;t want it to save any closer. This Panasonic shaver replaces one like it that I&#x27;ve used for 11 years, but the motor was beginning to get a bet weak and took more charging to keep it working a top speed. This is my third Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son. He loves it.</li>
    <li> This shaver takes off the beard well and is easy to use and clean.  Unfortunately, it is not as good a shave as the ES-SA40 which it ought to have replaced.  The reason is the cutting heads are much smaller than the ES-SA40 (which has been discontinued) hence the shaving process takes longer and is less effective.</li>
    <li> No cord means you&#x27;re out of luck when the battery dies. Charging transformer takes up space for both plugs in a socket.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for an outstanding price. It is worth more than other razors costing five times as much.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it was ineffective.  After many minutes of trying to shave the hair off - I gave up and had to return to the double blade.  I would say that everything that was known in the 80s when these first came out is still true.  You need one with a permanent cord attached for the full 120v power to do the job.  It&#x27;s just like a circular saw - a battery-powered one just will not suffice.  The ability of a disposable and lather is remarkable.</li>
    <li> excelent for the price.</li>
    <li> If you have anything close to an average beard or heaver forget about this razor it won&#x27;t do anything for your beard wet or dry. If you are just starting out shaving it should work well for you.</li>
    <li> It is cheap and good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied,&lt;br /&gt;Function is very strong for me, very low noise, very easy to clean, in the future I want to try a more advanced</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 12 year old son, who unfortunately is already having to shave. He loves the ease of using this shaver compared to other brands. Easy to use and clean. The wet/dry feature is also a plus for the price. He does not have a full grown beard, so can&#x27;t give a review on whether it can cut really thick grown man hair. This gives a nice close shave for my son. Would definitely recommend as a starter shaver.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple, affordable, compact electric razor to replace my expensive, fancy self cleaning braun that busted after 7 years of use. I&#x27;m asian, so it does the job very well. Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll be heavy duty enough for men that grow thick scruff on a daily basis. It&#x27;s fairly smooth and batteries have so far lasted 2 months on a single charge (daily use). Only complaint is the charger. Which it was a corded charger instead of a base, so I can use it while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
    <li> It is very handy. Thank you.</li>
    <li> this shaver works great on a days worth of stubble ... anything much longer wont fit in the holes. I keep it in the car and touch up my face when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price is cheap($28) the battery lasts for weeks between charges (the way I use it). and works fine for stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankis for reading,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry Ponziani</li>
    <li> Husband is happy with his new razor.  Price is very reasonable and he likes the close shave he gets with it.</li>
    <li> I Tried it both wet and dry and both were good but I think the wet was a closer shave</li>
    <li> good for someone starting out but I had problems with it on my beard especially when trying to get the hair off my chin</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  Considering that the razors cost as much as the entire shaver, it&#x27;s damn near disposable and acts like it.  Save your money for a real electric razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is piece of JUNK!!!, I charged it fully and then tried shaving, I ran it until the battery died and I hadn&#x27;t made it through half of my face, not because the battery died quickly, but because it shaved so poorly, this razor is suitable for a child&#x27;s toy, but definitely NOT for a man to shave with, I can&#x27;t believe Panasonic was willing to put their name on such a poor product.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the price but is slow and often leaves some hairs uncut. I suppose you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it! Uses it dry or wet and has no issues. Pretty cheap for a good razor!</li>
    <li> Nicely made.  Runs smoothly. No skin irritation.  It just doesn’t shave very well.</li>
    <li> He had one before, worn out  and needed a replacement.  Exactly what was needed.  Happy father&#x27;s day.  and happy gifter.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a wet shaver. As advertised it does indeed work under the shower. A single 15hr charge will last about two shaves. As a shaver it is average, it does poorly when the hair length is more than 3-4mm (about a weeks worth of growth) but works fine for daily shaving. The biggest issue I have is that it cannot be used while charging (it has a funny plug base for charging no cord) which makes it awkward if you are in the middle of a shave and it runs out of charge.</li>
    <li> Head is too small. Takes longer to shave than my old remington double head razor. Would not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> It feels more like a toy than a shaver when you use it. I had a Wahl before and it was much larger and got more done faster. Like the Wahl, it leaves the longer hairs behind and that is why I follow up with a rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for a few weeks now and I give it a 4 on a scale of 1-10. Positives&#x3D; surprisingly quite and cuts facial hair better than expected. Negatives&#x3D; small trimmer and does not work well for &amp;#34;man-scaping.&amp;#34;  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th Panasonic wet/dry razor. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it shaves. My previous Panasonic&#x27;s were the more expensive ones. It&#x27;s louder and the shaver head is smaller but I actually think it does a better job than the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> We have ordered previous models of this same razor for years.  This one fully met our expectations, and was on sale for less than the last shaver of several years ago.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was my  second ES-RW30-S shaver after using a similar model almost daily for 8 months.  I knew I was going to  replaced the 2 cutters soon,  but the shaver fell on the floor one day (hardwood floor) and the cutters, guard,  and head (holds the foils) came apart and the pieces went under the bed. One foil got a dent, and could not find one cutter. The foils, guard and cutters combo was $25 + shipping. So I bought another ES-RW30-S razor  for $26 instead.  This was my first foil electric razor, when I bought it 8 months ago, and after using rotary razors for years I was reluctant to change razor types, but for $26, I gave it a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m  65 and don&#x27;t see any difference in performance and  quality. I think it may be better!. But you must let your face get used to it for a month, just like the instruction say.  The charge will last about 5 days when you do a fast shave. I don&#x27;t care about the wet feature, I do not shave in the shower anyway.  The foils are delicate and will dent easily and are expensive to replace for this model, that is why I give 4 starts.</li>
    <li> good razor for the price</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well...always misses hair every time and takes longer than shaving with an actual razor</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my father. Apparently it is cheaper to buy a whole new unit than to replace parts. He loves it and got a whole new unit out of it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with the performance of this product.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave even a light beard and the trimmer just catches and pulls.....useless not even worth returning! not a shave much less a close one and i have a light growth.</li>
    <li> The beard trimmer is a flipout that sometimes flips back in when you are shaving (annoying). The trimmer width is also too short, so takes more time to shave.</li>
    <li> years ago,I bought a Schick 20 razor but it did not give me a close shave.Later on I got a hand me down&lt;br /&gt;Remington razor, it did a little better but this ES-RW30-S gives me a close shave and I am well pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the razor. I have not tried it wet and so far I use it dry.I was surprised at the cost compared what we&lt;br /&gt;paid years ago. Give it 30 days and you will see a difference in a close shave. Thanks Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Pesimo product does not perform its function shaving pure mark, the article is the staff works well but leaves much beautiful uncut</li>
    <li> Well, the shaver makes noise like its should, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;Probably took me 20 mins to get a lousy shave.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that works the way it should is the pop up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better.....</li>
    <li> i dont like the charger, it takes two sockets space. other than that, it is pretty good. light weight and the trimmer is good.</li>
    <li> A good razor to use daily in the shower.  I find they last 2-3 yrs before either the battery dies or I break it somehow.  It gives a smooth shave if used daily, but don&#x27;t skip more than two days or it takes awhile to remove the stubble.  I&#x27;ve used these for 15+ years due to the time saved by shaving in the shower and savings vs buying razor blades, etc.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-RW30-S Men&#x27;s Electric Razor Dual Blade was a perfect choice that does not seem to be offered in many retail stores that try to pitch much higher priced razors of inferior quality!  I was not disappointed in this purchase at all!  The Panasonic ES-RW30-S Men&#x27;s Electric Razor Dual Blade exceeded my highest expectations in price and shave!  A great choice for the money!  By they way the side trimmer is superior!</li>
    <li> The top part of the razor did not work. It was as if it was dull.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace another Panasonic Wet/Dry electric razor that I have used for the past 8 years. When the battery finally gave out I looked for the closest replacement. This razor has a nice compact charging unit that doubles as a wall mount. It works very well in or out of the shower and is a breeze to clean. The flip out trimmer does a great job as well.</li>
    <li> I have used these for many years.  It always works well.  My only complaint now is that it misses some of the grey hairs an battery life is just ok.</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I was trying to get around paying for expensive replacement parts for another Panasonic shaver that I owned. I did not realize and/or notice how this differed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is not on a wire. The entire unit plugs in, then you mount the shaver vertically upon it. Problem is that it is so bulky that it covers both plugs on an outlet pair, meaning that nothing else can be plugged in there. To add insult to injury, the charger requires 15 hours (!) to recharge the shaver. Realistically, you are probably going to tie up those two plugs for 24 hours. A tall order for most people&#x27;s bathrooms, I&#x27;d say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think that you can work around those timing issues easily, either. The shaver has no indicator lights to let you know its charge status. No warning; it just runs out of juice. And there is no quick charge feature, like other models. You must plug it in and walk away. Hopefully, you managed to finish your shave before that happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a low-power unit, and does not oscillate as fast as others. Its two blade sets are not separated by a slotted bar like others, either. However, this does allow tighter edging around facial hair - the only thing that I liked about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the seller (an Amazon partner-merchant) refused to take back a used unit, I exercised the manufacturer&#x27;s 30-day money-Back policy, and returned it directly to Panasonic for a refund. I am now waiting through the two months it is supposed to take to get a check. Meanwhile, I bought the head and blades for my older unit, and life is simple again.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave and very durable. My old one has more than six years of excellent service and still working pretty good. But now I want a new one. That´s why I bougth this one.</li>
    <li> My fiancee fell in love with these.  They are perfect.</li>
    <li> Good quality and works as expected.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Good shave and can take it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and two years later he is still in love with it. Great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a three-head rotary shaver, and it was a great improvement.  It shaves quicker and easier than that one; also easier to clean.  While it is designed as a &amp;#34;wet or dry&amp;#34; shaver, I only use the dry mode, along with the &amp;#34;Face-Saver&amp;#34; pre-shave talc stick.  I&#x27;m very happy with it so far, and it was priced very well, too.</li>
    <li> Make sure you order the one with the battery charge indicator. Otherwise you can&#x27;t see when the unit is discharged. Mine got discharged too quickly, had to return and Amazon charged me for return shipping.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Nice to be able to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> unless you are going to use it every day..do not bother buying. does not give a close shave once beard has grown a few days even using as a wet shaver</li>
    <li> The trimmer does not work - at all. It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair or do anything to it, actually.&lt;br /&gt;Pros : light and compact&lt;br /&gt;Cons : trimmer too small and doesn&#x27;t but anyway. Head not that flexible at all.</li>
    <li> 1 star might be too much for this product. It is a piece of  feces. I am surprised its a Panasonic product. This shaver will not give u a clean cut. I have to shave over same area 10 times, half an hour every day. U get what u pay for. Stay away.</li>
    <li> A very economical solution to removing the hair on my face! This is the 3rd or 4th Panasonic I have owned over the years. It gives me a nice clean shave!</li>
    <li> Quieter than my last Panasonic but misses more. Have to go back over same spots.</li>
    <li> as advertised, great product!</li>
    <li> This has been a very good purchase.  I get great shaves.  It is very easy to clean, It only needs recharging once a week and lasts for the next 7 days.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a Christmas present for my 21 year old grandson...He loves it and it gives him a nice close shave.  Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> still have it and working good, shaves not too close though</li>
    <li> It was a fantastically priced economy type shaver that is worth every penny paid!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would be a little more sensitive on my skin. Sometimes when I shave too close I get shaving bumps. But this was terrible in all aspects of shaving. I tried dry, wet, and with shaving cream. They all produced a shave that seemed more to pull my hair out than cut it. It left my skin looking like I shaved with my eyes closed and produced the worst razor burn of my life. My skin turned bright red and became inflamed. I get a better shave with a BIC disposable razor than this POS.</li>
    <li> I have had Panasonic razors before this one! I am surprised they would release such an inferior product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father who is in assisted living because I did not want him using a regular razor with the possibility of him cutting himself. It hardly can make a difference on his facial hair, he looks scraggily. Non of the care givers can get a good shave out of it. I do not know if they used it wet or only dry but whatever they have tried to do I am totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes the best electric razors: quiet, simple, &amp; shaves closer than others I&#x27;ve used -- will use nothing but Panasonics in the future!</li>
    <li> The razor shaves well; it&#x27;s quiet compared to my old Remington, and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied with the Panasonic razor</li>
    <li> does not work, does not leave the skin without hair, is not soft face</li>
    <li> After having the previous version of this razor for 6 years the battery finally started to quit. This is an excellent replacement. You can get razors with more blades and more features, but this razor meets my needs.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a good razor. Please do not try to compare this to a $100.00 plus razor. I had the older model and replaced it with this razor. So, I would, and did, buy it again.</li>
    <li> A gift to my father for Christmas and an early birthday gift, used it once and he absolutely loved it.</li>
    <li> This is a good light-weight razor that will give you a good shave . . . as long as you shave at least every other day.  I&#x27;ve had Panasonic razors that I&#x27;ve spent well over $100 on, and like most things, you get what you pay for.  This is not the Cadillac of razors, but it gives a clean close shave, painlessly and quietly, and does so at a very affordable price.  If you want a five star razor, you&#x27;ll pay a five star price.  As far as value goes, this razor would be hard to beat.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-RW30-S is pretty good at shaving however I do have to do a double, sometimes triple, shave in some areas to get all the hair out. The only big reason this shaver doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because of the bulky charger. The charger takes up an entire outlet slot. The charger doesn&#x27;t have a wire extension. To charge the shaver, it must be placed on top of the charging unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another side note: This unit does not have a battery indicator but most shavers around the price don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Good tool for the price.</li>
    <li> Sad to say a $1 razor from dollar store does 10x&#x27;s better than this. Not a close shave at all</li>
    <li> holds a charge well, and shaves scalp well too. Good for about 5 full shaves (face and head) on a full charge. Does not shave as close a razor blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using 3-bladed Panasonic shavers for over a decade.  Used with soap and water, the 3-blade variety shaves as close as a razor.  I went cheap and tried this dual-blade.  The results are inferior. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as with the 3-blade.  The 3 blade variety also has a battery gauge; this one does not.  I ended up buying another 3-blade and now have this as a $40 reminder not to go cheap.</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.  It takes forever for a shave and after you think you&#x27;re done, there&#x27;s always stubble left.  I bought this because I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Panasonic single blade razor ES-SA40, and I thought 2 blades would be better than one.  Not the case.  The dual blade cutting surface is smaller than the single blade. And the single blade does the job in half the time.</li>
    <li> It works great. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean. I take it with me on every trip.</li>
    <li> While shaving in the shower can be a time saver and the Panasonic ES-RW30-S is a cinch to clean, this shaver doesn&#x27;t shave particularly well either wet or dry. My old Brauns, while not suitable for wet use, were much better as long as their tissue paper thin screens remained undamaged. This one requires a lot of passes to get most of my beard (perhaps the screen is too fine or too thick), but leaves longer hairs that must be taken off with a blade or the trimmer. The pivot head is a funny design feature that is worthless: heavy pressure is required to bend it either way, making chafing a probability. The shaver is ergonomic, comfortable to hold (albeit in a choked-up grip with my thumb on the power switch) and holds a charge for many shaves. The trimmer is small and efficient.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a cheap philips rotary razor. I used it twice and ended up with irritated skin and a very poor shave. The pop up trimmer is useless and can&#x27;t manage more than a couple hairs at a time.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Good price. Too new to comment on reliability or longevity. I bought another one after I tried it.</li>
    <li> Well, I owned a Panasonic shaver for 5yrs and never had problems.&lt;br /&gt;The price was so low that I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!</li>
    <li> The razor simply wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to cut my beard. Travel razors usuyally aren&#x27;t but I didn&#x27;t realize that when I bought it.</li>
    <li> My previous Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver required a new battery after 10 plus years of use.  A new battery would cost more than this replacement which turned out to be superior to one it replaced.  A value at the price and hopefully it will last as long as my first one.</li>
    <li> its a multi purpose tool, dropped it a few times(Built tough) like REALLY Tough</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these so far and they do the job but as they get older they don&#x27;t cut near as close.  Buy new blades etc.  Nah, for the cost I&#x27;d buy another one.  I&#x27;ve used electric razors for over sixty years and non of them are really great.  Started with Remington for many years, then a Nurelco and now Panasonic. I think I&#x27;ll start over thru the list.</li>
    <li> This is the third Panasonic razor of this type that I have purchased.  The model number changes as slight modifications are made, but I am always looking for a double foil with pop-up trimmer, at an inexpensive price. I replace the razors after about three years, when the battery life starts to diminish.  I shave daily, and the razor does a good job.  I prefer to shave at the sink, but could use the razor in the shower, since it is a wet-dry model.  Maybe I am missing a fine wet shaving experience in the shower.  For daily shaving, at a low shaver price, this razor is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong, but this doesn&#x27;t cut anything. I&#x27;ve tried it on my legs.  Husband has tried on his beard.  Son has tried it on his new mustache. It nibbles, but does not cut anything worth noting. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but if I&#x27;m going to shave in the shower, I might as well use a razor</li>
    <li> excellent product, what I asked was what got me</li>
    <li> Not only does this give me a wonderul close shave, it&#x27;s quiet. It can also be used in the shower, which I&#x27;ve not tried yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the charger that must be plugged directly into a wall, then the razor is inserted into it. I giess you could stick it into an extension cord and try to lay it on something. The razor seems to connect tightly enough to the charger where that might be possible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can live with the charger for a quiet, smoooth, hassle-free shave.</li>
    <li> I Look at many websites for the best price for electric shavers and I found it with this shaver was the best. The price was great and it shaves very well. When charging you need used both electric outlet one to plug in the shaver charging adapter and the other outlet is cover by the shaver.</li>
    <li> this product is terrible, I am going to return it. it is unable to shave my neck and even for my face I used my old shaver.</li>
    <li> This has to be  one of the best buys in shavers. A close quiet shave at a very reasonable price. What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> does not shave close at all</li>
    <li> Just perfect for travel but I have come to use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Great shave for a very reasonable price. Works great...wet or dry. Very quiet shaver..easy to clean up after shave. I highly recommmend this shaver</li>
    <li> This shaver works great  - for the price, it is quite the good value.  I use it daily and have had good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin</li>
    <li> Bought it for my 17 year old son and he was skeptical at first. After trying it out a couple times he says it works well.  I haven&#x27;t had to tell him to shave lately!</li>
    <li> Awful. Bought it for my husband and it doesnt work at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 17 year old. This is his first razor, and he loves it. He uses dry and applies after shave.</li>
    <li> My husband is not at all happy with it.  Says it does not give a clean shave.</li>
    <li> hubby will love it when he gets it for christmas</li>
    <li> Works okay to cut one day shave. Not effective as much after that&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> This razor is absolutely horrible.  I need to use a regular razor each time to touch up the areas the Panasonic did not cut.  Too bad I already threw the box away...I&#x27;d love to return it.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. Can&#x27;t beat it for the $&#x27;s spent!  I use it with shaving cream...it&#x27;s the best of both worlds (blade shaving and electric shaver)</li>
    <li> Basic shaver, no frills, somewhat uncomfortable to hold and slightly heavy for it&#x27;s size.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the snap&#x27;on base power supply adapter..</li>
    <li> SHAVES NO BETTER THAN PANASONIC&#x27;S EARLIER MODEL - HAVE TO WORK JUST AS HARD TO GET THOSE WISKERS THAT DON&#x27;T GROW PERPENDICULAR.</li>
    <li> Works great, cuts beards.</li>
    <li> Cut 1and 1/2 inch marks on my face. Left a burning sensation on face for day. Had to use my old Braun to cut the remaining hairs. Ouch! That hurt! Me no like that!</li>
    <li> Just okay, have to shave over and over</li>
    <li> a little bit noisy and it&#x27;s not for global voltage.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give my face a break from razor shaving, when I couldn&#x27;t replace the charger for my old electronic razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does exactly what I wanted! It doesn&#x27;t shave a single hair, so my face definitely gets a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried dry, hot water, shaving gel - still I have to do 90% of the hair removal with a regular hand razor. I genuinely expect trouble with the neck region - there is no region on my face that this device shaves. My beard is not generally coarse and never has more than 5-6 days&#x27; growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank heavens it was only $30.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this electric shaver to replace a Panasonic shaver that broke.  This shaver is very smooth an extremely quiet in comparison to the one I replaced.  It shaves very well and leave my skin feeling smooth when done.</li>
    <li> This razor is junk and a major disappointment. I&#x27;ve been a loyal Panasonic user for the last 20 years and ONLY used Panasonic wet/dry razors. I always relied on the single blade razor and found it to be a sturdy and high quality product. It would usually last about 2 years before I needed to replace the blade but it was typically cheaper to buy a new unit. When I finally needed a new razor I was surprised to find that Panasonic had discontinued my trusted model and the closest replacement was this piece of garbage. First, the actual size of the razor is about half as long as the screen. This means that the blade doesn&#x27;t actually go to the edge of the screen, making it impossible to get to certain areas on your face. Second, the beard trimmer is no longer a beard trimmer and at best is a side burn trimmer. Unfortunately, the way it&#x27;s designed (flip up) makes it very difficult to use without it flipping back down. I&#x27;ll never understand why Panasonic stopped making their very effective single blade razor because this one doesn&#x27;t cut it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> the blades get dull quickly.  It shave closely for about 1 month then it lose its sharpness.  it is cheaper to buy a new one then getting new blades, new battery.</li>
    <li> Of course I bought this for a Christmas present, and it does not work well at all...  And now it&#x27;s too late to return.</li>
    <li> purchased this as a christmas present for my step father. he used it right away and loves it. great bargain at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> quiet smooth razor but hard to hold in the shower.  I like to hold the razor at the head to shave by feel.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver and thought it will work well. I was wrong. All it&#x27;s useful for is making noise while you rub it against your face. It will not shave anything. Had to shave with an older Remington which actually gives you a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an electric razor, don&#x27;t even think of looking at this product.</li>
    <li> great buy! great buy! ok shave, easy to clean, easy to operate, cheaper than using a razor blade.  cant go wrong</li>
    <li> My series 3 Braun had deteriorated over the years, but when I went shopping for a new cutter/screen, I found the price unreasonable.  At the same time I realized that my battery powered Panasonic travel shaver gave me a better cut than the Braun had, even when new.  But, it used throw-away batteries and had no trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given Amazon&#x27;s liberal refund policy, this shaver seemed to offer what I wanted at little risk, so I ordered it.  For my light beard, it&#x27;s great.  Quiet. Quick.  Easy to clean.  Has a good trimmer.  Inexpensive.  Works wet or dry; I usually use it with Williams Lectric Shave for the closest shave.  Have tried other pre-shaves that don&#x27;t work as well.  If you have a relatively light beard and shave every day, this shaver is a great choice.  If I miss a day, sometimes I have to go after long whiskers with the trimmer, but in balance this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had in maybe 55 years of shaving.</li>
    <li> I have used it long and short, wet and dry and my hair is still there unfortunately. Maybe I should have just spent the extra money.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun electric shavers over 25 years. Recently, I feel Braun shavers&#x27; quality is not high enough due to the raised price. Then, I tried this Japanese brand. I can say this is the best buy due to the price, $27. This one can shave same as the 80 bucks Braun shaver. I never buy a Braun. I love it.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d buy an electric razor for a little less. One not at the top of the range. Bad decision. Definitely one of those places you shouldn&#x27;t skip out on. I used this thing for two weeks before I got sick of not being able to shave.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> gift for gentleman in nursing home - good price</li>
    <li> Very good unit battery last very long 4 to 5 days.</li>
    <li> Good price. Bad performance. I had to go back to my old shaver. Too bad I threw the box away or I&#x27;d return it. You have to go over and over the same spot to get a semi-decent shave. I don&#x27;t have time for a fifteen minute shave.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself shaving with my Remington rotary shaver which was about 4 years old, and feeling drag and finding stubble that needed several passes and often required the trimmer to get it all. So I bought this shaver because it seemed better spending $35 on it rather than spending $25 on the replacement heads for the rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shoulda gone for the replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this new shaver, I found myself feeling drag and finding stubble that needed several passes and often required the trimmer to get it all. Deja vous?</li>
    <li> I had a previous razor for about 8 yrs. The battery died and I jacked It up trying to replace it, so I bought this one. It&#x27;s a great razor, easy to use, easy to charge, easy to clean and I think it&#x27;s quiet as far as razors go. The double blades cut better than my previous single blade did and the pivoting head helps get in there close.</li>
    <li> This shaver can only use 100-120 v power. As a result, I had to buy a converter. People do travel to areas with 220v power supply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a real fan of electric shavers, in fact this is only my 2nd one in 50 years.  The shave is never as close as a razor, but in a week moment I purchased this one.  It&#x27;s solid and well constructed and handy.  It&#x27;s in my closet for now and I&#x27;m back the to old reliable razor.</li>
    <li> Close shave, unimpressive battery life, nice charger, though, and pop up trimmer.  Has trouble with longer hair but works great for daily shaving</li>
    <li> I like this shaver so much I&#x27;m considering buying another one to have as a spare.  And the price I paid for it was an incredible deal. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> For the price it is a good wet/dry shaver. I have owned a few Norelco and this one has been a good shaver. Highly recommend as long as you do not grow a thick beard.</li>
    <li> do not buy this piece of garbage!!! does not shave/remove facial hair at all!! I cannot believe this item is on the market?</li>
    <li> Shaves better than a Remington that I paid more than twice the price of. Light, easy to handle and clean and I actually like the wall charger unlike other reviews.</li>
    <li> This is a well made razor and works. But, unless you have peach fuzz growing out of your face it really isn&#x27;t worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for giving it two stars instead of one is because it is well made.</li>
    <li> A year ago I bought one of these for about $32 [regular price $70].  It was time for a new cutter-foil pack.  $21.99 seemed fair.  I didn&#x27;t realize there was a $5.95 shipping charge until checking out the &amp;#34;cart.&amp;#34;  placed the order anyway.  The package arrived in six days.  It contained a brand-new shaver!  What a surprise.  Now I have a shaver and an identical [year-old] back-up.  Nice</li>
    <li> I got it specifically as a wet shaver to get those hairs that are hard for my normal razor to get close to my nose.  It does the job well enough to clean those up.  Also, the side-burn trimmer on the back side is pretty powerful and precise.  Not bad at all for the price.</li>
    <li> must run many times over same area, sometimes with no effect at all, giving up after may attempts, even my pana phone sucked this time around</li>
    <li> The one thing which I like the most is it&#x27;s light weight and washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other panasonic shaver charger the shaver charging system is different I have to carefully dock it whenever I finished with it which I don&#x27;t like. it&#x27;s kind of &#x27;spend more and get better&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Had the older version and this one has some improvemnet much higher RPM nice package with simple charger great for travel I relly like that.  The screen is also good my older one never wore out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic wet/dry shavers before, so I bought a new one since a replacement battery was not available for the one I was using. I like the way the shaver locks into the charging base, my old one managed to come loose from the charger, especially when I was unplugging it after charging. I was afraid if I did not have good grip it would fall to the floor and risk damaging the foil screen. I can&#x27;t figure out why so many wet/dry shavers are priced at well above $100 while this one was less than $35. Great buy despite the low price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used similar Panasonic shavers for over 15 yrs. and this is one of the worst. It feels as if it has been used for months. Either the product is defective, I was sold a used product, or the quality of these shavers these days is very poor to begin with.</li>
    <li> Play a nice role at this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the bad reviews. This shaver is very much like the ES-4026 which is no longer made. The charger fits nicely on the top of the recepticle leaving room to plug in something else at the bottom. I don&#x27;t understand why one of the reviews said this was a problem. The shave is about the same as as for the ES-4026. Same for the trimmer. As for durability, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> I like it but the Philips seems to have a cleaner shave</li>
    <li> Surprised that this was as good as it is or the money.</li>
    <li> Am very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> After many, many years of contemplating an electric razor, I finally decided to take the plunge.  After researching the different brands, I decided on the Panasonic.  I especially liked the wet-dry feature.  I am very happy with my choice.  Although shaving with an electric razor is a bit different than with a blade, I am getting used to it and think I will continue.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very easy to clean, and does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Mesh seems to be too fine and impedes cutting results.</li>
    <li> Used it a few times so far and works great.  The charger is compact and is designed very well.  Sideburn trimmer is positioned kind of awkward compared to my old razor.</li>
    <li> order it and it arrived within a few days.  Although there were other choices, this is an entry into electric shavers and a test to determine how well they work, generally.  We are pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, it pulled the hair out of his face. My husband tried it. He used it several times thinking that it was his beard length. Nope. It just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> Return it, tried it for 2 shaves, could not even cut 2 day growth of beard off. My beard is light. Tried with soap and water and with shaving cream. Neither worked. Went back to a razor for now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t if I&#x27;m something wrong but I can&#x27;t get a close shaved.</li>
    <li> I have the earlier version and it has been very good.  It is needing replacement cutters and head so I opted for the newer version for less money than the replacements.  Bear in mind the newer version has a little different angle and you will need to get accustomed to it.  Today on my 5th or 6th shave I was able to get get a smooth shave without using a blade to clean up.  Patience pays off.</li>
    <li> I have very little facial hair, and I rubbed my face raw just thinning it out. Horrible and cheap. Do NOT buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a superb price.</li>
    <li> Of all the Panasonic Shavers, this is the one that gives you the most bang for your buck. They have better and more expensive models, but this one is definitely a best buy !</li>
    <li> This is a very quiet shaver for the price. It also gives a reasonably close shave. If you have a thick beard like I do, this works reasonably well to shave it down, so you can then use a regular razor to quickly mop up the leftovers. It&#x27;s worth the price. Also the trimmer works very well for ear and nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver at a great bargain.  Easy to clean and wash.  Easy to charge and use . Just exactly what I needed for simple daily shaving purpose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE ALREADY COMMENTED &amp; GAVE A REVIEW..WAS  GIFT FOR MY SON  &amp; HE LOVES IT...LIKES BEING ABLE TO USE SHAVING CREAM WITH IT &amp; ALSO CAN USE IN SHOWER</li>
    <li> After surgery my husband was not allowed to shave with a regular razor, so we purchased this online.  It arrived very quickly.  He loves it so much he has decided to continue using it even thought his shaving restrictions have been removed.</li>
    <li> Wow, surprised by how terrible this thing actually shaves. I&#x27;ve had good success with Panasonic shavers in the past and thought they were good, inexpensive alternatives to Braun and Norelco, etc. But after ordering two (one for my son and the other for me) I&#x27;m frustrated by how long shaving has become. It eventually shaves the hair off - but not after going over it about twenty or thirty times! The inner blade is noticeably smaller than past Panasonic wet/dry shavers I&#x27;ve bought - that must be the culprit. Anyway, first impressions were great - sleek, lean and modern looking. Cool charging system and lightweight - but when it came to actually shaving - my whiskers seem to beat this shaver and only give up after many attempts... I&#x27;m sorry I purchased this thing! Seems better suited for gaily shaving rather than taking off a goatee or waiting a week to shave... perhaps if I use it on a daily basis it will be more consistent... I really want to like this, but I&#x27;m still waiting. Will write again if things improve.</li>
    <li> Good price and this item and the product work great. Long battery life</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using the word &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; but this is the only option Amazon gives when you really don&#x27;t like a product.  Regardless of the blade setting, I would pass over a section of stubble five times and there was still stubble remaining. Update - I&#x27;ve noticed that when a product receives several positive reviews the price usually increases.  Therefore, the current price of this product may be higher than the price I paid when I bought the product and posted my review.  I&#x27;m a frugal shopper and I buy a product only if I believe the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Terrible razor.   The 3 blade is worth the extra money.   This Dual blade just pulls at hair and does not cut.</li>
    <li> It shaves great.  It washes easily.  It is a great value for the price.  So far, it is the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice. This is what I&#x27;d call a bare-bones shaver. Nothing fancy but, for the price, it does the job. I was looking to replace my old shaver which I don&#x27;t use very often and, this fit the bill. The price was the main factor in choosing this shaver. I didn&#x27;t want to spend  much money for a shaver that I&#x27;d use occasionally. With the results I got with my first shave, I might just start using this one on a regular basis. I have one tip for anyone who wants to purchase one of these. After cleaning it, I use canned air to dry it off because of the mineral content in the water.  Nice shaver!!!</li>
    <li> Did  not work at all.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. REQUESTING A REPLACEMENT and post  review then. Giving them a chance to get it right. However right this does not deliver, very very poor performance  . Welll  got a replacement but it is just as bad. This product is a waste of money. There is no positives about this useless product...</li>
    <li> Tried this razor and had miserable shaves each time, so much so that I had to use a regular razor to shave many spots! Returned!</li>
    <li> I like it.  My wife appreciates that it is not as noisy as my old Remington MS280.  It can give a close shave, but it takes a while (5+ minutes), with many passes over the same spot to get close.  But, it is easier to clean and seems more robust than the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fellow engineers, the Remington has single-piece plastic followers with slots that accept two crankshaft lobes, and the plastic eventually wears out so that the travel gets shorter and shorter over time.  I couldn&#x27;t resist taking apart the Panasonic, and I discovered that it uses a more complex mechanism, with connecting rods between the crankshaft and the reciprocating blade assemblies, which should reduce friction greatly and extend the life of the reciprocating blade mechanism.  So far, so good, but we&#x27;ll see in a few years...</li>
    <li> kept my old one to long, replaced screens and cutters three times.</li>
    <li> I like to shave in the shower. I had a couple of older versions of the Panasonic wet/dry razor over the years that I wore out. I still have one that&#x27;s battery operated, but prefer a rechargeable. Local discount stores want $80 or more, but I thought that was out of line. Saw this one and decided to give it a try, especially at less than $30. I think it shaves better than any I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a month or more and it works great.</li>
    <li> It wasnt what he was use to but I think it works great. Its doesnt have the 3 heads but I think it works just as good.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, lightweight, very handy charger (plugs right into a wall socket - no cord!) holds a charge well and rinses clean.  My only complaint is that it tends to miss some longer hairs, a problem if you don&#x27;t shave every day.</li>
    <li> I have had many shavers in my shaving life and far and away this has to be the worst ever.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know when I was so disappointed in a product. The look, the feel are nice but that&#x27;s where it ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use as a wet shaver with a mug and brush. First I used it dry and was not at all satisfied (two day beard). Then I tried it with soap. I finally realized that I would never get a good shave because my beard was going to grow faster than this thing could cut! No I don&#x27;t have an unusually heavy coarse beard, just normal, and yes I took the cover off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the petty stuff, the charger takes up the an entire outlet.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice razor. Have only used it for light growth and it gives a smooth close shave.</li>
    <li> I had the older model for a few years and was reluctant to change but this model is as good or better than the last. It also seemed a bit quiter than the model it replaced. For the money I have yet to find one that compares.</li>
    <li> It will NOT  CUT close enough--I&#x27;m VERY UNHAPPY with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have  always had success with a similar model that I had</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE TRIPLE BLADE PANASONIC 7035 FOR YEARS. WELL ONE DAY MY RAZOR CAME UP MISSING,BACK TO THE BLADE I WENT. I NEEDED A RAZOR FOR THE NO TIME TO SHAVE IN THE MORNING DAYS. THIS RAZOR SHAVES GREAT FOR A TWIN BLADE AND UNDER $25 IT WAS A STEAL.&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE USED AN ELECTRIC FOIL RAZOR BEFORE AND KNOW HOW TO GET A GOOD SHAVE WITH IT, DO NOT THINK TWICE. BUY THIS RAZOR, YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin as I do then shaving with this Panasonic shaver is a great investment. It comes with a charger and holds a good charge an cleaning it is a snap.</li>
    <li> i wood NOT get this i use it for 4 day and this is what it do to me</li>
    <li> This is the Worst Razer I have ever owned! It cuts like crap and is even worse in the shower!</li>
    <li> The razor does the trick for me.  I must admit that I am not hirsute as other males, so can shave faster and quicker.  Such being the case, the battery life for someone else would not last as long as mine- six weeks before having to recharge!  Amazon offers products at a discounted rate, in most cases.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother, And it didn&#x27;t even shave his hair off. S9 I tried it on my facial hair, and no luck just a waste.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a back up or travel shaver.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Thanks !! Reading some of the reviews  helped me make a  VERY GOOD PURCHASE!! I bought this for my husband this pass xx-mas and he love . It&#x27;s been very hard to find him a shaver that he can use to shave the hair on his bald head.</li>
    <li> The nursing home broke the first one... You cannot drop it onto the floor.  The blade cover cannot be tapped roughly for cleaning as it is very fine and fragile... I bought two and the second one is in the car and I shave my dad when i go see him. I like the shave it gives him and he seems to enjoy the warm buzzy attention.</li>
    <li> My husband usually buys some pretty cheap razors and he said this has been the absolute worst he has ever used. Now keep in mind this is dry shaving. He doesn&#x27;t like to wet shave so he is not speaking for that. He said he would rather use a cheaper one he had than this one.</li>
    <li> Worst electric  razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I read many of the reviews when purchasing this. First of all, this is a razor for short facial hair. As you can see, it does have a trimmer that flips out. Both this and the razor work well. Second, I cannot shave long hair of any kind with any kind of razor (even with my Merkur safety razor) without first trimming it down. So to expect this razor to be able to shave down your beard to nothing is just plain stupid. I don&#x27;t know why you would even try shaving anything but stubble with this or any other kind of razor. Maybe if you were waxing or epillating it would be appropriate to have longer hair. But not for shaving. So the negative reviews that knock the lack of trimmer built into the blade, well, don&#x27;t believe them. It clearly doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer, aside from the flip trimmer on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is an excellent razor. It has a close shave, it&#x27;s nice and quiet, and it&#x27;s easy to charge and wash. You don&#x27;t need a razor with fancy technology when you can get this.</li>
    <li> The battery lasted more than a month of use without recharge. Works Great!</li>
    <li> it is very good.fast and excellent</li>
    <li> This was for my teen-age son, and he couldn&#x27;t use it after the first time.  Instead of cutting the whiskers, it yanked them out, leaving a rash-like area on his otherwise clear skin.  Obviously painful, too.</li>
    <li> Overall a decent quality shaver, but the only problem I see is that the head is too narrow. It needs to have a larger radius (curvature) on the head for a more comfortable shave. The only advantage to the narrow head is that it allows you to get a better shave in the area between your nose and upper lip, but overall it makes it more difficult to use.</li>
