      <li>That&#x27;s when I stumbled upon Noble Formula HC Cream.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s how I found noble formula.</li>
      <li>I suggest Noble Formula do something like this.</li>
      <li>Great for psoriasis works well and quickly.  </li>
      <li>Despite the price, I was inspired to purchase a container because of the excellent reviews and the claim that it&#x27;s formulated for the most sensitive areas (like eyelids, in my case).</li>
      <li>Cannot recommend this product more.</li>
      <li>: I am on my third order and still enjoying the excellent results.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This noble  cream works fantastic on my serreba dermatitis.</li>
      <li>You &#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been on many dates since.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>: This stuff works like magic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
      <li>more redness around my nose, eyebrows and chin area.</li>
      <li>: I tried tar and zinc shampoos, but I&#x27;ve found that the blue bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders is working the best over time.</li>
      <li>: This stuff works like magic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream and redness and flakes are gone and stay that way, even if I do not use more than a week.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I make two more applications that day.</li>
      <li>but it helps more than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used that wasn&#x27;t a prescription cortisone cream.</li>
      <li>Listen, there&#x27;s some sort of magical witchcraft happening here</li>
      <li>Great product, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Z-bar was great to get rid of flakes (nose creases, mustache area, eyebrows), same for noble soap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;OK, July 8, 2015 Fifth Jar&lt;br /&gt;Small pump bottle works fine - instead of putting my fingers into the jar every day &#x3D; contamination issues.</li>
      <li>Truly a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>I was probably up to over $500 in Rx&#x27;s before I tried this cream, which (so far) is more effective than any of those.</li>
      <li>So far, so good --</li>
      <li>First I found the Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc (ZnP) Bar Soap ($12.99) and after trying that with some success I decided to order this cream which had the added Hydrocortisone that would hopefully help with the itching.</li>
      <li>After the first use, I was looking better.</li>
      <li>Thats 9 months worth!  </li>
      <li>Within a week there is significant improvement working in conjunction with their shampoo and soap.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, not a single OTC cream has done any good at controlling the itching and damage caused by my eczema, even those which are labeled as &amp;#34;anti-itch&amp;#34; cream.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Noble Formula, my symptoms disappeared completely within days.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to all the perfumes that are added to so-called &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products, you&#x27;ll be thrilled about this product.  </li>
      <li>It got to the point I&#x27;d only go out if I was having a good (skin) day.</li>
      <li>I only experienced an extremely mild bit of that with the first application but haven&#x27;t felt it since.</li>
      <li>Works well to keep my mild psoriasis in check.</li>
      <li>Quick suggestion.</li>
      <li>I then did a quick search on amazon for Zinc products and ended up ordering this and the zinc soap bar with 1-day shipping.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not any more oily than I normally am.</li>
      <li>worked  more effectively than the various EXPENSIVE creams and lotions my dermatologist prescribed, and that&#x27;s with excellent insurance.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a whole $20 more than when I first purchased it.</li>
      <li>I was able to keep this cream fresh for nearly 2 years.</li>
      <li>In fact, everyone in my extended family is now using various Noble Formula Products by Ontos.  </li>
      <li>As before, it works to soothe redness, fresh bumps and itchiness but still does NOT cure.</li>
      <li>Yeah, sure it sorta worked, took about a week to clear up.</li>
      <li>As before, it works to soothe redness, fresh bumps and itchiness but still does NOT cure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the regular noble bar soap after the z-bar was discontinued.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money</li>
      <li>I was able to keep this cream fresh for nearly 2 years.</li>
      <li>BUT MY PHYSICIAN FELT IT WAS TOO STRONG FOR MY SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
      <li>I have only been using it for a few weeks now, but I can tell you that this stuff works excellent for me.</li>
      <li>Since my first struggle with atopic dermatitis, I&#x27;ve been washing my eyelids with baby shampoo.</li>
      <li>I would cover it with make-up, making sure not to touch my face afterwards because if my make-up rubbed off I would have red showing through.  </li>
      <li>but if you have had seborrheic dermatitis you know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve not written many reviews but this product definitely deserved my 5 star endorsement.  </li>
      <li>He also had been using a dandruff shampoo that was making his hair fall out, and the Noble Formula Shampoo has completely stopped the dandruff problem and his hair is growing back.  </li>
      <li>My daughter and daughter-in-law both use the regular Noble Formula Zinc cream on their faces and their faces have completely cleared up.  </li>
      <li>but it has relatively short list of ingredients: Hydrocortisone (1%), purified water, Almond Oil, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Rose Hip Oil, Arachidyl Behenyl Alcohol &amp; Arachidyl Glucoside, Natural Vitamin E</li>
      <li>Completely stunned by how quickly it worked.</li>
      <li>When I have used the Noble Formula, I prefer to apply it in the evening after work, as it does have a slight smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Aristocort (R) prescription (no longer available) was the first cream (not ointment) that helped back in 1971.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just so happy that I found something to offered my poor irritated skin relief.</li>
      <li>Works for me and jar lasts much longer this way.</li>
      <li>Nothing really worked except hydrocortisone.</li>
      <li>and nobody really knows about it.</li>
      <li>very red.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It pumps very well</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend this cream.</li>
      <li>Fast forward to this cream arriving about two weeks ago.</li>
      <li>After trying MANY products, natural and prescription remedies this is the only product that has worked.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Later: So I took my own advice and transferred contents into a small pump bottle.</li>
      <li>I have never had such quick results.  </li>
      <li>I have had good success with prescription creams, but it gets expensive to have a $90 dermatologist visit and then a cream at $50 per tube.</li>
      <li>This product seemed a little too strong at first, but I stopped using it for a couple days and then began using it again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All I can say is wow...  I&#x27;ve had seborrheic dermatitis since high school. Only recently did I discover what it was however.  It started with just the occasional dry skin at the base of my nose to heavy scaling there along with red scaly skin at the bottom right and left side of my chin. Similarly scaling also occurred along my hairline on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also started having the same issues on my chest with the occasional pustules as well (gross I know).  Fast forward to this cream arriving about two weeks ago. After reading all these reviews I just had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief, it works! I&#x27;ve been applying it with a q-tip twice a day to avoid dipping my fingers in the tub of cream so as to keep it as fresh as possible. After two days the redness and scaling began to subside. After a week it was completely gone and my chest no longer itched like crazy and the pimples had dried up and healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not written many reviews but this product definitely deserved my 5 star endorsement.  If you suffer with seborrheic dermatitis you owe it to yourself to give this a shot.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Noble Formula has changed my life. I&#x27;m 25, but every year since I was 20 or so, my skin got worse and worse with Seborrheic Dermatitis. It got to the point I&#x27;d only go out if I was having a good (skin) day. A clean shave and a coating of Cetaphil would merely keep my seb deb at bay, while leaving me very red and shiny/oily. This was my every day, year after year. I thought it was just dry skin, I became so sick of it, I started doing a lot of research and I learned what it was, and that I was far from alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started with very minor flaking on the eyebrows, then on the sides of the nose. It spread to the ears and cheeks below the eyes, then onto the chin and above the lip. If you know anyone with any of these symptoms, please, point them here. They suffer, they are subconscious, but you can change their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seb deb ended up making close face to face contact for me impossible, finding a date impossible, and routinely looking at the reflection on my phone to see how I was holding up when I was out and about during the day. I started looking for zinc based as I learned it&#x27;s actually a fungus and zinc is fungicidal and that&#x27;s how I found noble formula. I read the reviews of the other one (non-steroid) and became very optimistic. With my seb deb being bad, I decided to give it the shock treatment and go fourth with the steroid. Good decision... Let me tell you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had almost immediate relief. I have not had a single reoccurrence, and I have only applied this maybe 8-9 times over the last 100+ days. In fact, I periodically re-apply, just incase, not because I&#x27;m having seb deb rear it&#x27;s (very) ugly head again. My confidence is the highest it&#x27;s been in half a decade.. and I&#x27;ve been on many dates since. Boom!</li>
    <li> I have minor seborrheic dermatitis along sides of my nose and down towards my mouth. It would flare up and the skin along side of nose would get kind of leathery and hard. I started using this stuff and within a couple of weeks I don&#x27;t have the red blotches and the skin has become soft, hasn&#x27;t felt like that in years. I have only been using a month now but so far I would recommend. I am going to purchase the product without the HC and see if that works for me. Other reviewers mentioned a burning sensation when they applied product. I only experienced an extremely mild bit of that with the first application but haven&#x27;t felt it since. I only use it once a day.</li>
    <li> So far, so good -- worked  more effectively than the various EXPENSIVE creams and lotions my dermatologist prescribed, and that&#x27;s with excellent insurance.  I was probably up to over $500 in Rx&#x27;s before I tried this cream, which (so far) is more effective than any of those. This is pricey, but  I have not yet been disappointed. If anything changes, I will update this review accordingly, but to date...? Very, very impressed.</li>
    <li> This noble  cream works fantastic on my serreba dermatitis. buy it. You &#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> This cream is a lifesaver....I had an allergic reaction to a facial which caused a seb derm flare up and nothing was fixing it.  I tried everything and my skin would soak it all up within 20 minutes and end up being dry and itchy all over again. Well..that was until I stumbled across this cream and decided to take a chance on it.  My skin is pretty much back to normal now and all my flakiness is gone! Of course my skin is still a little red, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 days so I&#x27;m optimistic.  I&#x27;m just so happy that I found something to offered my poor irritated skin relief.</li>
    <li> Works well to keep my mild psoriasis in check.</li>
    <li> Product seems to be as advertised.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream for my daughter who has suffered from eczema and chronic dermatitis since she was a toddler. She has been using it for about a week and is already asking where I ordered it from. Her skin has cleared up almost completely in less than a week. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with scaly and cracking skin in my ears. This product seemed a little too strong at first, but I stopped using it for a couple days and then began using it again. It took about 2 weeks to get rid of the infection. Now my ears feel like new.</li>
    <li> This formula helps keep my lifelong troublesome skin in check - as long as I use it religiously. A few days off and the skin is broken out again. So it&#x27;s not a cure - yet - but it helps more than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used that wasn&#x27;t a prescription cortisone cream. Aristocort (R) prescription (no longer available) was the first cream (not ointment) that helped back in 1971. I&#x27;ve had this issue on different body parts since the 1950s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m now on my fourth jar. Quick suggestion. Since a little goes a long way, use a small spoon, dip fingers into the spoon (instead of the jar) and *then* apply to skin. Wash the spoon. This eliminates the finger-in-the-jar transfer that often contaminates the rest. Works for me and jar lasts much longer this way. I would actually like a pump jar to eliminate the spoon altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later: So I took my own advice and transferred contents into a small pump bottle. This eliminates the spoon. Just in case cream is affected by light, I keep it in a dark drawer. Will look for an opaque pump jar for the next order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, July 8, 2015 Fifth Jar&lt;br /&gt;Small pump bottle works fine - instead of putting my fingers into the jar every day &#x3D; contamination issues. After a few months the cream always smells a bit &amp;#34;rancid.&amp;#34; Could be the container was not opaque enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sp, this time I purchased a truly opaque bottle also from Amazon (Infinity Jars 100 Ml (3.4 Oz) Black Ultraviolet Glass Push Pump Bottle). Very expensive bottle but truly opaque. The neck is very narrow so I spooned almost the entire jar into a plastic sandwich baggie and piped it gently into the narrow opening. It pumps very well and I hope the very dark environment will help preserve the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May I suggest Noble Formula do something like this. A $40 jar lasts a long time but not if it becomes contaminated by fingertips or containers that are not dark enough to preserve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 17, 2017: The *Infinity Jars 100 Ml (3.4 Oz) Black Ultraviolet Glass Push Pump Bottle* jar (from Amazon) worked! I was able to keep this cream fresh for nearly 2 years. As before, it works to soothe redness, fresh bumps and itchiness but still does NOT cure. I only use a little as the irritation gets worse in the winter with a more &amp;#34;closed in&amp;#34; environment. The black glass and pump delivery system which keeps air and other contaminants out are key. If you use this cream, please consider transferring to another container if this fairly expensive cream goes rancid sooner than you&#x27;d like.e* jar (from Amazon) worked!

    <li> This cream has been life changing for me in a very short time. I started noticing dry skin problems in 2008 when I was 16. I&#x27;d get red skin and big flakes on either side of my nose pretty frequently. Over the past 7 years it&#x27;s expanded to the bridge of my nose and my eyebrows. In the past 6 months I started flaking severely around my entire scalp line and decided that a change was in order. I tried a lot of moisturizers and tried rubbing dandruff shampoo on my affected areas. Both helped somewhat but still left my skin very red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and within 24 hours I had 0 flakes on my face. Completely stunned by how quickly it worked. I&#x27;m a couple weeks in now and haven&#x27;t seen even the slightest hint of a flake. The affected areas are recovering and getting back to a normal color again. My confidence is up, I don&#x27;t catch my reflection in the mirror and see a cracked flakey mess anymore. Cannot recommend this product more.</li>
    <li> I have been fighting peeling dry skin for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;I am sub-thyroid and atributed my skin problem to havig&lt;br /&gt;the metabolism of a turtle.WOW was I wrong,this cream cleared up my entire problem&lt;br /&gt;in 4 days.Can&#x27;t say enough good things.&lt;br /&gt;I also got DERMAZINC spray/drops that eliminated the dandruff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular noble bar soap after the z-bar was discontinued. Z-bar was great to get rid of flakes (nose creases, mustache area, eyebrows), same for noble soap. However both of them still left my face slightly red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream and redness and flakes are gone and stay that way, even if I do not use more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more redness around my nose, eyebrows and chin area. Also no more flakes in the creases of my nose, eyebrows and mustache area. I wish I could show you a before and after photo. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this formula a couple of weeks ago and its done wonders to my face. When my face flares up it normally feels like aliigator skin, it itches, scales and everything in between which definitely makes it harder as a females because I can&#x27;t apply makeup. So far I haven&#x27;t had a single product so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this cream. I suffered from extremely dry skin around my eyebrows, sides of the nose, and in my facial hair. I tried various face lotions (First Aid Ultra Repair, Aveda, etc) and they helped only temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Noble Formula, my symptoms disappeared completely within days. I have only had to reapply about 6 times in the last 3 months since first purchasing. It also relieved redness and dryness on my cheeks nearer to my nose. I still use Aveda as a daily moisturizer. When I have used the Noble Formula, I prefer to apply it in the evening after work, as it does have a slight smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note for hair: I tried tar and zinc shampoos, but I&#x27;ve found that the blue bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders is working the best over time.</li>
    <li> I started having dry skin on my nose two years ago. It started on the side of the nose and I thought it was just dead skin peeling off because I had gotten a sunburn. The flaking never stopped and after six months later it got a lot worse. For an entire year I&#x27;ve been dealing with redness and irritation in my T area and it looked awful, but as a 20 year old male there was not much I could do about it (I thought).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day it got so bad that I called off work and spent my time doing research and considering paying out of pocket for a dermatologist. I stumble across an article about Seb. Derm. and realized all the symptoms described were the ones I was experiencing. I then did a quick search on amazon for Zinc products and ended up ordering this and the zinc soap bar with 1-day shipping. Two days later all dead skin and redness was gone. A week later it&#x27;s as if nothing had ever happened and I catch myself taking it all for granted. It&#x27;s really amazing and I&#x27;ve never written a review before but I don&#x27;t want anyone stuck in the situation I was in. It really changed my life and made me realize everything I was doing before (loads of moisturizer, sun block, limited cleansing for fear of irritating) was making my face so much worse. I know it may seem like an exaggeration but if you have had seborrheic dermatitis you know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s a great product and it amazes me how they don&#x27;t sell it anywhere around here and nobody really knows about it.</li>
    <li> In July 2013, I had the misfortune to develop allergy-induced pink eye, for which I was prescribed a medicated eye drop. The second day of using these eye drops, I noticed red flaking on my eyelids. I thought it was residual from the thick eye drops, but it persisted even after the conjunctivitis was healed. I saw doctors who said it was one thing and another, but nobody could give me a prescription that helped relieve my symptoms. Meanwhile, I was suffering physically and mentally. My eyelids were red, inflamed, scaly and peeling, and I was mortified. This lasted until around Christmas, when a PA prescribed me a hydrocortisone cream. A couple weeks later, the flakiness stopped and my eyelids returned to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did it. I survived. This mystery ailment was defeated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. July 2014 comes around, and to my deepest dismay, I notice my eyelids have begun to scale like a lizard. The first thing I did was fall into an instant panic. How am I expected to live like a lizard for half of the year every year? I knew my best approach would be to pick up some hydrocortisone cream and hope it nips this issue in the bud. Oh wait, I don&#x27;t want to leave my house with lizard eyelids. Best check Amazon. That&#x27;s when I stumbled upon Noble Formula HC Cream. (This is starting to sound like a commercial). Despite the price, I was inspired to purchase a container because of the excellent reviews and the claim that it&#x27;s formulated for the most sensitive areas (like eyelids, in my case). I received it two days later and made the first application, which requires very little cream. No burning! I like that. No white residue on my eyelids either. Bonus. I make another application in the evening before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wake up and check out my eyelids. They haven&#x27;t gotten worse. That&#x27;s good news. I make two more applications that day. The third day, I wake up and hop in the shower. Since my first struggle with atopic dermatitis, I&#x27;ve been washing my eyelids with baby shampoo. No different today, but -- wait -- yes, different. Could it be? My eyelids are baby soft. There&#x27;s no scaling. There&#x27;s no flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days. This kicked my eczema in three days. Sorcery. Witchcraft. I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: This stuff works like magic. Buy it. With your money.ampoo.

    <li> The inside of my ears would get extremely dry, itchy and flakey, I mean so bad that I would avoid talking to people close up when my ears were particularly dry. Some days were worse than others.  I have seen my doctor about this but I was never prescribed anything and I was told to try lotion, baby oil, dandruff shampoo, etc..  I have tried numerous lotions but nothing seemed to really work well, it would help, but if I missed a day or was outside all day, my ears would be in &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; shape. After being embarrassed long enough, I started doing some research on &amp;#34;dry ears&amp;#34; and I found an article written about this &amp;#34;dry ear&amp;#34; condition and the doctor who wrote the article recommended using a cream  such as a Hydrocortisone Cream, so I went on Amazon, found this one and ordered it to try out. It works excellent, my ears have not been this &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; in a long time. I actually got my hair cut today and was not worried what the hair stylist would think about my ears while cutting my hair! I have only been using it for a few weeks now, but I can tell you that this stuff works excellent for me. Great product, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old lab. He has skin problems and this product calms the itching, redness, and irritation down immediately. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot for it to relieve skin problems.</li>
    <li> Works, but spoiled too soon.  Next time I will refrigerate.</li>
    <li> Great product, stops the itch.</li>
    <li> So I have suffered from... penile psoriasis for awhile (3+ years). Nothing really worked except hydrocortisone. It is a sensitive area so I&#x27;m not too comfortable with steroids in this area much stronger than hydrocortisone due to potential skin thinning. Hydrocortisone works well enough by itself, but this product is a mixture of other things with the hydrocortisones job being to &amp;#34;enhance it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of use you wouldn&#x27;t even know I had psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I have had Rosacea for 18yrs, I had accepted it as a fact of life and not one that I liked; it made me self conscious because people would always ask about my &#x27;sunburn&#x27; or think that I am angry because my face is red. I would cover it with make-up, making sure not to touch my face afterwards because if my make-up rubbed off I would have red showing through.  Recently, my Rosacea had gotten worse and was now accompanied by annoying itching so I went back to the internet to see if I could find an &#x27;inexpensive&#x27;, OTC and possibly natural remedy that would help get things under control.  I found a few people noting that Pyrithione Zinc (an ingredient in dandruff shampoo) was helpful - so I thought, what the heck. First I found the Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc (ZnP) Bar Soap ($12.99) and after trying that with some success I decided to order this cream which had the added Hydrocortisone that would hopefully help with the itching. I will say that, at $39.99 for 4oz, it is a bit pricey but if you are just using it on your face it will probably last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had this cream for a few days but so far it feels amazing - it goes on smooth and seems to be working; my redness has decreased and the itching has stopped. I have been using it in place of a moisturizer and have even worn it under make-up. Now, it does leave my face a little oily but I think that is a small price to pay for having the redness decrease and it&#x27;s not any more oily than I normally am. I would definitely recommend trying this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m not sure how natural this cream is but it has relatively short list of ingredients: Hydrocortisone (1%), purified water, Almond Oil, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Rose Hip Oil, Arachidyl Behenyl Alcohol &amp; Arachidyl Glucoside, Natural Vitamin E (d-Alpha-Tocopherol), Cetearyl Alcohol &amp; Cetearyl Glucoside, Pyrithione Zinc (.25%), Sodim Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, and TEA-Carbomer)</li>
    <li> I finally found a product that works.  I have seborrheic dermatitis and it gets worst in my face during the summer.  I have tried everything.  I read a review from amazon that described my symptoms of flaking and itching.  My skin was discolored too.  I was wearing makeup trying to cover it up, but it made the situation worst adding burning and more flakes.  This product saved the day.  It took about 4 days to see  improvement.  Now, after 10 days, you can&#x27;t tell I have a problem.  My skin looks and feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> If you have suffered from skin rashes, dandruff, and mysterious red, irritated skin patches, you&#x27;ll be amazed at the products produced by Ontos.  My husband has had skin outbreaks for years and this completely cleared up his back in 2 weeks.  He also had been using a dandruff shampoo that was making his hair fall out, and the Noble Formula Shampoo has completely stopped the dandruff problem and his hair is growing back.  I also use the product on an area between my shoulder-blades that was always itchy and covered with red, scaly skin… it&#x27;s all gone.  My daughter and daughter-in-law both use the regular Noble Formula Zinc cream on their faces and their faces have completely cleared up.  In fact, everyone in my extended family is now using various Noble Formula Products by Ontos.  The BEST thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to all the perfumes that are added to so-called &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products, you&#x27;ll be thrilled about this product.  It actually doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> Great for psoriasis works well and quickly.  Within a week there is significant improvement working in conjunction with their shampoo and soap.  Will definately recommend and re-order.</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for a very short time, but already it seems to be helping with my eyebrow dandruff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I suffer from eczema had a really bad breakout on my leg, I use this along with the soap and it cleared it up. I give it four stars because of the price. It&#x27;s a whole $20 more than when I first purchased it.</li>
    <li> I put some of this on an area of skin that was red and flakey and had been that way for a while with nothing curing it, but after the 1st use of this cream it has now turned from red to light pink and I know it&#x27;s going to be flesh color after a few more applications. This stuff is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this product when I was at my wits end with my red skin.  My sister has rosacea, and suggested I may have it as well... but at the time I didn&#x27;t have the coverage for a dermatologist. I started using this cream and the soap and with in 2 weeks I saw a difference!  I have never had such quick results.  My sister, who has fancy medicated gels and creams was even impressed with how quickly it worked.  A little goes a long way too.  I bought this tub in August, and I am now just looking to buy a new one (practically April).  Thats 9 months worth!  Truly a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT BUT MY PHYSICIAN FELT IT WAS TOO STRONG FOR MY SENSITIVE SKIN. I DID STOP USING IT BUT I STILL THINK IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WITH PROBLEM SKIN.</li>
    <li> UPDATED 11/2015: I am on my third order and still enjoying the excellent results. I only use when needed to control my itching. I use about one canister every 6 months or so. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I have used a wide variety of over the counter and prescription creams to control the itching on my skin, particularly on my fingers. Honestly, not a single OTC cream has done any good at controlling the itching and damage caused by my eczema, even those which are labeled as &amp;#34;anti-itch&amp;#34; cream. I have had good success with prescription creams, but it gets expensive to have a $90 dermatologist visit and then a cream at $50 per tube. FINALLY, here is the answer for me. I have been using this Noble Formula cream alone without any prescription cream to successfully control all itching and damage from my eczema. Considering my long history of creams that don&#x27;t work, I am blown away by this cream. It has a thin consistency, but this allows you to use a very little amount to make a thin coating which does the work that needs to be done. Once my symptoms were under control, I use very little of this cream on a daily basis. I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Lightweight, doesn&#x27;t smell terrible, not greasy. A little bit goes a very long way. After trying MANY products, natural and prescription remedies this is the only product that has worked. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Already healing dryness and only used it for 1 week.  Got in soap and spray also. I&#x27;m glad I ordered</li>
    <li> I never thought that there would be a good solution for seborrheic dermatitis. I&#x27;ve been to 2 dermatologists and a general practitioner, and was told the same thing, to use a steroid cream (prescription) and anti-fungal creams.. Yeah, sure it sorta worked, took about a week to clear up. Yet, lately my seborrheic dermatitis has been worse and none of the prescribed ointments worked. So I reached out to Amazon Reviews and come upon this. Listen, there&#x27;s some sort of magical witchcraft happening here cause it cleared up my skin in a weekend. After the first use, I was looking better. Here it is, day 3 and I&#x27;m completely cleared up. This stuff is amazing. I love it.</li>
