      <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My favorite perfume for many years.  </li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
      <li>But seriously, it&#x27;s my favorite of the collection.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this perfume for years, but I bought this one this week and is like water.&lt;br /&gt;Usually one spray and the smells hold for 12h+ in my skin, but this one I use 3 sprays and the perfume doesn&#x27;t hold more than 3 hours...</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t as for more than that</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It is &#x27;woodsy&#x27; and sexy.</li>
      <li>My all time favorite.</li>
      <li>Large size, really good price.</li>
      <li>The jean paul gaultier arrived early which was great</li>
      <li>I am very pleased I received my package fast</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the type of person where I don&#x27;t like to have the same scent as everyone else, so I often mix and match my perfumes, but with this one, it smells so great that I feel I would be doing it a disservice</li>
      <li>Is there really anything more to be said?  </li>
      <li>This perfume is my mom&#x27;s favorite because it is very sensual.</li>
      <li>I was excited in being able to purchase this authentic French fragrance for a fraction of it&#x27;s cost.</li>
      <li>I first used this a long time ago and loved it.</li>
      <li>Right Cost.</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
      <li>Love this product and extremely happen about the price.  </li>
      <li>I realize that all perfumes are different and for different tastes, but if you have an adventurous lady in your life, I would consider it.  </li>
      <li>Delivered on time,  sealed and new.</li>
      <li>I ordered it here and still found it to be expensive, but I honestly think its worth it.</li>
      <li>When I got it opened, both bottles had leaked and one was only half full.</li>

<li> I recommend this perfume to women aged 40 years.</li>
<li> I had a hard time finding it again.</li>
<li> this item has a very delicate medal packaging.</li>
<li> but it was so expensive!</li>
<li> I just had to get this perfume, I bought the men&#x27;s cologne for my husband and had to have it in women&#x27;s and wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all</li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>

    <li> Large size, really good price. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I first used this a long time ago and loved it. I had a hard time finding it again. I finally found it in an airport but it was so expensive! I ordered it here and still found it to be expensive, but I honestly think its worth it. I&#x27;m the type of person where I don&#x27;t like to have the same scent as everyone else, so I often mix and match my perfumes, but with this one, it smells so great that I feel I would be doing it a disservice if I did that. I always get so many compliments every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume for many years.  Always asked by others what I am wearing.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my Mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite scent. Delivered on time and undamaged. Can&#x27;t as for more than that</li>
    <li> all excellent, recommended 100%</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles. I could smell the perfume when I brought the box in the house. When I got it opened, both bottles had leaked and one was only half full. This is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s JPG! Is there really anything more to be said?  But seriously, it&#x27;s my favorite of the collection.  Will buy again,  I think it would smell great on just about anyone.</li>

    <li> This perfume I bought for my wife on Valentines, 1996.  She has not changed since.  It is &#x27;woodsy&#x27; and sexy. An aroma that arouses several senses. I realize that all perfumes are different and for different tastes, but if you have an adventurous lady in your life, I would consider it.  It has been good to me.</li>
    <li> My fav perfume of all time. Delivered on time,  sealed and new.</li>
