    <li> You can no longer get this product in department stores. I only found it through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com.  I was excited when I found this body veil and ordered it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped quickly and was happy with the transaction and convenience.</li>

    <li> i was thrilled to finally be able to find the lotion for my favorite perfume.  Every local retailer has stopped selling it!!</li>

    <li> Been using this Body Veil for close to thirty years. Hard to find and works great when the weather is warm. Saves you the expense of the perfume by using this silky veil.</li>
    <li> Just hope they don&#x27;t stop making this scent available.  It is so hard to get right now but, as usual, Amazon comes through!</li>
    <li> Ysatis is my favorite fragrance--I like to use this after a  shower for skin and it helps to layer the scent.</li>
