      <li>No enhancement that&#x27;s for sure</li>
      <li>i referred many people to this product as i receive many compliments</li>

      <li>I know it will serve a much better purpose there.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
      <li>loved this really helps lashes look thicker.</li>
      <li>It was previously made by IQ Derma, is now being distributed by Intelligent Beauty Labs.</li>
      <li>That said, it does work, and you do see improvement, just not as much or as fast as with the original ones.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Smart Lash for over a year now, and can tell you that my lashes are noticeably longer!  </li>
      <li>since they started to get more and more pale, I thought I&#x27;d try Smartlash.</li>
      <li>which I still apply every day while I have mink extensions on) or just individuals (my tech that puts my individuals on commented on lashes being fuller than when I first came to her).</li>
      <li>I thought maybe the first one was old/defective</li>
      <li>Maybe for someone who already has nice long thick-ish lashes, it might, but for someone who doesn&#x27;t at all and wants that, it won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I have no trouble reading with sunglasses and block sun light very well.</li>
      <li>the positive note they said they would refund my money</li>
      <li>It worked for her; might work for you, but I can&#x27;t personally recommend it.hes, and I could easily apply them, so I didn&#x27;t think too much about it.  </li>
      <li>100% of users found improvement after 30 days;100% felt that they needed less mascara; 100% felt they looked younger and more confident, 100% would recommend the product to a friend.</li>
      <li>Used on a regular basis, there is a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I always wear mascara, yet my friends say I wear too much mascara.</li>
      <li>So I really lost on this venture to enhance my lashes.</li>
      <li>Much prefer the applicator brush with Smartlash than the brushes that come with Latisse.</li>
      <li>This product does not work and it is very irriating.</li>
      <li>Try it if you want, but don&#x27;t expect much in the way of results.</li>
      <li>Please, don&#x27;t bother, as it really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on something I wasn&#x27;t sure about, and I thought the SmartLash was reasonable, compared to other brands, and affordable for my budget...</li>
      <li>The main company changed the packaging a bit, and even though they say they didn&#x27;t change the formula, it certainly doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes on this product but was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I only get extensions for special ocassions.</li>
      <li>Recently, I did notice a friend&#x27;s eyelashes had filled in considerably and asked her about it.  </li>
      <li>But of course, those were the days when many young women wore false eyelashes, and I could easily apply them, so I didn&#x27;t think too much about it.  </li>

      <li>I THOUGHT I WOULD  BE ABLE TO SEE A DIFFERENCE WITHIN A FEW DAYS.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for two months straight, following the directions exactly.</li>
      <li>Right now I feel like my lashes are long and full enough with just a dab of mascara.</li>
      <li>Now i only use one coat of mascara, since Smart Lash makes them longer ! ..</li>
      <li>Talika, the historic first.  </li>
      <li>Well, guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised!</li>
      <li>Talika, the historic first.  </li>
      <li>Not only are my lashes not longer, thicker, or darker, I have just wasted $45 and have been putting chemicals around the most sensitive area of my face for over 8 weeks, twice a day!!!</li>
      <li>Many people, men and women, notice their eyelashes and eyebrows thinning as they age, so many people are looking for a product such as this: a certain expensive prescription product that promises fuller lashes has recently made quite a stir in this market.</li>
      <li>I am a 54 year old african-american woman.</li>
      <li>, I began naturally losing eyelashes and eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>And that its prostaglandin-free and paraben-free formula, which uses peptides instead, will not irritate the eye areas of those with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>, I began naturally losing eyelashes and eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>do not waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;After 30 days there was not change in my lashes or brows</li>
      <li>So I am looking for something reasonably priced and that actually works.</li>
      <li>and I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>SMARTLASH is a lash enhancement treatment that promises it will give the user long, thick, full, strong eyelashes, and possibly even thicken the user&#x27;s eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t unusual for my upper eyelid to be completely bare.  </li>
      <li>Especially after I get mink lashes it seems lilke when the old lashes shed, the new lashes grow longer (</li>
      <li>Of course, only apply enough of the product to moisten the skin; not so much that it drips into the eyes.</li>
      <li>that I have long lashes that I can actually brush aside ;)...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better, also had worse.</li>
      <li>I have always wanted to have a little longer eye lashes - who doesn&#x27;t, right?</li>
      <li>However,  when I managed to break that habit, my eyelashes still came in scraggly and sparse, and my hands were no longer adept enough to apply fake lashes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very short eyelashes. I always wear mascara, yet my friends say I wear too much mascara. I tried &amp;#34;SMART LASH &amp;#34; and started seeing a difference in 2 weeks ! I use it in the morning before I apply makeup and at night before bed.  I love this product !  Used on a regular basis, there is a huge difference. Now i only use one coat of mascara, since Smart Lash makes them longer ! ..The best eyelash growth product with great price!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a 2 months and have not noticed any difference in my lashes at all. Unsatisfied and can not return it.</li>
    <li> SMARTLASH is a lash enhancement treatment that promises it will give the user long, thick, full, strong eyelashes, and possibly even thicken the user&#x27;s eyebrows.  Many people, men and women, notice their eyelashes and eyebrows thinning as they age, so many people are looking for a product such as this: a certain expensive prescription product that promises fuller lashes has recently made quite a stir in this market. This is a relatively inexpensive, nonprescription product that claims to be physician-tested and recommended.  It was previously made by IQ Derma, is now being distributed by Intelligent Beauty Labs. The makers state that it is ophthalmologist-approved for wearers of contact lenses.  That its Visilash technology formula has achieved clinical results in helping users to achieve longer fuller lashes and brows in as little as seven days, with optimal results in 60.  And that its prostaglandin-free and paraben-free formula, which uses peptides instead, will not irritate the eye areas of those with sensitive skin there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the maker, participants in its studies reported up to a 68% improvement in lash strength and fullness.  100% of users found improvement after 30 days;100% felt that they needed less mascara; 100% felt they looked younger and more confident, 100% would recommend the product to a friend. They state that the product should be shaken before usage, applied twice a day, morning and night, not to the lashes but to the eyelid skin at the base of the upper and lower lashes.  Of course, only apply enough of the product to moisten the skin; not so much that it drips into the eyes. It must be allowed to dry before application of eyeliner or mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well before the age at which people may find their eyelashes and eyebrows thinning, I had a bad nervous habit of pulling my eyelashes out.  It wasn&#x27;t unusual for my upper eyelid to be completely bare.  But of course, those were the days when many young women wore false eyelashes, and I could easily apply them, so I didn&#x27;t think too much about it.  However,  when I managed to break that habit, my eyelashes still came in scraggly and sparse, and my hands were no longer adept enough to apply fake lashes.  And that was before, along with my age cohort, I began naturally losing eyelashes and eyebrows.  So I have tried many, many products.  Talika, the historic first.  The expensive prescription, which did show improvement, but irritated the eyelids too much, and recommends usage forevermore.  Recently, I did notice a friend&#x27;s eyelashes had filled in considerably and asked her about it.  She recommended this product.  I bought it and tried it.  Think I saw a little regrowth, but found it did irritate my eye area.  So I have stopped its use.  It worked for her; might work for you, but I can&#x27;t personally recommend it.hes, and I could easily apply them, so I didn&#x27;t think too much about it.

    <li> Warning! This product does not work! I want my money back!   I have used other brand of eyelash enhancer before, thought try this one out since it&#x27;s cheaper. But it is totally wasting of money and time! I don&#x27;t even want to give one star, but I had no choice to not giving any stars on this website.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better, also had worse. It does the job even when you apply once a day instead of twice as recommended</li>
    <li> This product does not work and it is very irriating. I doubt that Dermastore will refund my money. Sadly I signed up for auto refills and got 4 that I will not use because it does not work for me. So I really lost on this venture to enhance my lashes. I plan to try another product. I have used Li Lash with results, but it is pricey. So I am looking for something reasonably priced and that actually works. No auto refill orders or \\&quot;deals\\&quot; until I see results!!! Learned my lesson on this one!!</li>
    <li> loved this really helps lashes look thicker. Will buy bigger size next time. cheaper price on line than in store.</li>
    <li> I THOUGHT I WOULD  BE ABLE TO SEE A DIFFERENCE WITHIN A FEW DAYS.  I&#x27;VE HAD IT A LONG TIME AND I&#x27;VE NOT NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL.  WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these on some coupon site. (Won&#x27;t do THAT again!)  Used BOTH and saw absolutely no effect whatsoever.  I thought maybe the first one was old/defective/whatever but the second one showed no effect either.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t imagine how this is still on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be conned</li>
    <li> Not seeing a difference.  Would not purchase again.  Did not do as promised.  Disappointed in product.  Product was not as described.</li>
    <li> In 2013-14 I started using every morning after I wash my face. I had thin short lashes, now I have mid-length to long lashes that cover end-to-end on my top lash line, and my bottom lash did not exist before and now I have a little which is enhanced when I put a little eyeliner on it, which I like. This product for me works long term. Especially after I get mink lashes it seems lilke when the old lashes shed, the new lashes grow longer (which I still apply every day while I have mink extensions on) or just individuals (my tech that puts my individuals on commented on lashes being fuller than when I first came to her). I only get extensions for special ocassions. Right now I feel like my lashes are long and full enough with just a dab of mascara. There are people that have longer and fuller lashes than me, but with what I started with and where I am now this is an improvement. I gave four stars because it is a process and not instant satisfaction.  I am a 54 year old african-american woman.</li>
    <li> I have been using Smartlash for a couple of weeks now and I can tell a big difference in my lashes, I haven&#x27;t noticed that they are fuller but they are noticable longer.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and plan on purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Smart Lash for over a year now, and can tell you that my lashes are noticeably longer!  Very pleased!  Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the purchase to the readers.I have no trouble reading with sunglasses and block sun light very well.</li>
    <li> Hi, this is Robert&#x27;s wife, Kelly, and I have had amazing results with the SmartLash!  I&#x27;m 48 years old, and all of a sudden I began losing some of my eyelashes, (I mean, like in patches).  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on something I wasn&#x27;t sure about, and I thought the SmartLash was reasonable, compared to other brands, and affordable for my budget...Long story, short, I have all my lashes back, and NO PATCHES! YAY!</li>
    <li> I was very anxious to start using this, the reviews (on the DermStore Website where they sell it, that should have given me a clue) were raving about Smartlash. I have always wanted to have a little longer eye lashes - who doesn&#x27;t, right? So I bought 2 containers and am using it dilligently, I was determined to have long lashes, period! I even dream about it at night, that I have long lashes that I can actually brush aside ;)... but it didn&#x27;t work. I still have appr. 1/2 container left and will use everything, 2 x per day. I will continue using it till everything is gone. But If after 5, 6 weeks no change has been noticed, I am not optimistic. I will go back and give the few dollars like what this costed to dog rescue orgs and humane society. I know it will serve a much better purpose there.</li>
    <li> I received smartlash as a gift from a friend. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work and I have been pleasantly surprised. I didn&#x27;t have an issue with my lashes but just like every girl I wanted them to be longer and thicker. I plan on purchasing this for myself once I finish the tube I have.</li>
    <li> Well, guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised! This product doesn&#x27;t work. I have been using it for two months straight, following the directions exactly. Not only are my lashes not longer, thicker, or darker, I have just wasted $45 and have been putting chemicals around the most sensitive area of my face for over 8 weeks, twice a day!!! Goes to show how vain I can be! I have never really had those thick, long black eyelashes that some seem to have so naturally, so since they started to get more and more pale, I thought I&#x27;d try Smartlash. Please, don&#x27;t bother, as it really doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe for someone who already has nice long thick-ish lashes, it might, but for someone who doesn&#x27;t at all and wants that, it won&#x27;t work. Try it if you want, but don&#x27;t expect much in the way of results.</li>
    <li> The shipper of this product is GREAT!!  The main company changed the packaging a bit, and even though they say they didn&#x27;t change the formula, it certainly doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to.  That said, it does work, and you do see improvement, just not as much or as fast as with the original ones.  Considering the very high price, you can get other products that work as well for much less.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes on this product but was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work so do not waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;After 30 days there was not change in my lashes or brows&lt;br /&gt;All the great reviews must have come from the company that made dermalash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive note they said they would refund my money but I have not seen the refund yet.</li>
    <li> I have used both Latisse and Smartlash by Dermastore.  Both have done the job well for me.  Much prefer the applicator brush with Smartlash than the brushes that come with Latisse.</li>
    <li> I bought Smartlash just 2 weeks ago. Already my lashes are thicker and longer. I&#x27;m 47 and starting that hormonal hairloss and thinning. Thought I would just try and see how this worked. I apply it twice a day. Great results.</li>
    <li> It has only been a month, but I see little to no results.  I will give it another 30dys to see.</li>
    <li> purchased this about 5 months ago-used it 2 times a day, i can notice the difference in my eyelashes and eyebrows(yes it make your eyebrows look fuller).. don&#x27;t often wear mascara but when i do they look even more amazing. i referred many people to this product as i receive many compliments</li>
    <li> I was told about a similar product but this was about half the cost so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try before having to order the more expensive product.  I have been very pleased with Smartlast and will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful that this would be the cure all product, but after two weeks, I see no difference in my eyelashes.  No enhancement that&#x27;s for sure</li>
    <li> Smartlash works!  I had thin, short eye lashes and within a month I have noticed them longer.  Not thicker but longer.  I wish I had taken before and after pictures but I would not put a review out here if it did not work!</li>
