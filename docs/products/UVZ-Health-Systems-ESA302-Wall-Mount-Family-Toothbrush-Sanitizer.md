      <li>I love this sanitizer.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know if the UVZ will be more durable (hope so), but it has many design superiorities over the Violight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since we have been using this sanitizer, I feel much better about our toothbrushes.  </li>

      <li>this is far superior!</li>
      <li>This is attractive, easy to use, more versitile and stays much cleaner.</li>
      <li>This is a great sanitizer, I&#x27;ve had it nearly two years and haven&#x27;t had to change the bulb yet.</li>
      <li>plus it is easy to install....</li>
      <li>I was confused about the size and look of the product ,whether it will suit my bathroom or not, but when I got this product I can not tell how happy Iwas by its design, colour and size ideal for nomal sized bath room</li>
      <li>So easy and convinent.</li>
      <li>The adhesive is strong, and you can put two screws (included) in the wall mounter plate.</li>
      <li>the ultra violet light comes on after you close the door...&amp; periodicly, ensuring your utensiles are sterile when needed....</li>
      <li>, well only time will tell on that one.desired, but I purchased the optional stand for it and that works great.    </li>
      <li>I purchased this item a few months ago and it has worked out perfectly for us.  </li>
      <li>bulb is EIKO 4W G4T5 Ultraviolet UV-C T5 Tube G.5 30 Volt Light Bulb which is available at lightbulbsurplus(.)com.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This unit is by far the best such device available to date.....</li>
      <li>I have 5 electric toothbrushes and my fingernail clippers hanging in there getting clean</li>
      <li>Now, After using this product, I don&#x27;t need to clean.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure your kids are closing the door gently and not slamming it shut.      </li>
      <li>Simple design and good product.</li>
      <li>but it has a nice clean look overall and is sturdy with the stand.</li>
      <li>So many of them fell on the floor or other places and had to be replaced sooo many times.  </li>
      <li>No worries of the many germs and viruses that could potentially grow on any items placed in it.</li>
      <li>so am satisfied it is working properly.  </li>
      <li>I know the importance of eliminating as many germs as possible</li>
      <li>The only downfall is the toothpaste holder, it tends to be easily removed with the tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;The sterilization cycle is triggered by opening and shutting the door which is nice with little kids as you know</li>
      <li>and it is very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I know that my tooth brush head is sanitized and ready to go.    </li>
      <li>at a reasonable price....</li>
      <li>Not a cheap looking product which is nice because it stands out quite a bit on the countertop.</li>
      <li>In short this product is very usefull and should be in every bathroom specially  in the kids bathroom.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>We were catching colds from each other constantly from September-December</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also has a snap on external holder on the right side of the unit to hold a tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would be nice to have them in preparation of bulb failure.</li>
      <li>But now I do need a new toothbrush holder.</li>
      <li>would have to say that it is the same bulb that came with the unit, if you read the writing on the bulb, it is exact.</li>
      <li>You have to clean out inside every a few weeks.</li>
      <li>This time of year my kids in particular will have had several colds by now.  </li>
      <li>If you put toothbrush on it, it lights on for few minutes and off, and    regularly the light on and off automatically.  </li>
      <li>I surprised there was white water mold because it cleans by steam.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big germophobe, but when it come to the toothbrushes and waterpic heads that I put into my mouth twice a day, I am very conscious of the possible germs and contaminates.</li>
      <li>the unit holds your brushes upright so that any residual liquid drains down &amp; away from the head, ensuring a clean dry brush when next used...</li>
      <li>important to me is the design where the toothbrushes hang down FROM the unit, rather than down INTO the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had several products over the years that required standing toothbrushed up and the ensuing build up of gunk was discusting and hard to clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are green and red function lights, green for stand by and red for active sanitizing although as you can see whether the UV lightbulb is on or not makes the indicators kind of redundant.&lt;br</li>

    <li> This sanitizer is wonderful!  I got it because I have four kids who were leaving their toothbrushes anywhere and everywhere in the bathroom.  So many of them fell on the floor or other places and had to be replaced sooo many times.  After a lot of internet searching, I decided on this product.  I like that the toothbrushes hang down so no gunk collects like other sanitizers.  I wall mounted my sanitizer and it is very sturdy.  The adhesive is strong, and you can put two screws (included) in the wall mounter plate. You may want to keep the cord tied up short if you can, otherwise it drops on your sink.  Also, make sure your kids are closing the door gently and not slamming it shut.      Since we have been using this sanitizer, I feel much better about our toothbrushes.  We haven&#x27;t been sick and my kids actually put their toothbrushes back in it.  Great product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am the mother in a family of six people, 4 of those being 10 and under.  We were catching colds from each other constantly from September-December and I was fed up.  Finally I found this product and bought it for us for Christmas.  It fit perfectly on our wall and everyone&#x27;s toothbrush has it&#x27;s own spot.  We are very pleased as we have not had a cold go through the household since Christmas! Call it coincidence if you wish, but I believe this toothbrush sanitizer has definately contributed! I would recommend it to anyone with several children in their household.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product 1 month ago for my family of 6 members.Before the arrival of UVZ I was confused about the size and look of the product ,whether it will suit my bathroom or not, but when I got this product I can not tell how happy Iwas by its design, colour and size ideal for nomal sized bath room and the kids also enjoying using this product. In short this product is very usefull and should be in every bathroom specially  in the kids bathroom.</li>
    <li> I searched toothbrush sanitizer for a long time and at last I found this.  I used a few month \\&quot;Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer(49$) on amazon\\&quot; However, It was for only 2 person. After using this, and checked the inside. I surprised there was white water mold because it cleans by steam. You have to clean out inside every a few weeks. I didn&#x27;t like it.   Now, After using this product, I don&#x27;t need to clean. So easy and convinent. If you have many family members, you can use this(over 5).    If you put toothbrush on it, it lights on for few minutes and off, and    regularly the light on and off automatically.  Simple design and good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I like that there is no where for \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; to collect. I got tired of cleaning out my electric toothbrush holder. I also like that my husband keeps his razor in the sanitizer. This just gives me more peace of mind that I&#x27;m doing all I can to protect us from whatever is the \\&quot;latest\\&quot; germ around.</li>
    <li> Although I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s actually killing germs it seems to do what it&#x27;s suppose to.  I mounted it on the bathroom wall and it can accomodate any type of toothbrush we have including strange sized character brushes for the kids.  It turns on when you close the door and it does periodically turn on after the initial cleaning cycle.  Maybe it&#x27;s just that the weather is getting warmer or a coincidence but we do seem to be getting sick less since we started using this.</li>
    <li> I love this sanitizer. I&#x27;m not a big germophobe, but when it come to the toothbrushes and waterpic heads that I put into my mouth twice a day, I am very conscious of the possible germs and contaminates. The contaminated water and germs that spray and scatter around the bathroom has come to attention lately and this really freaks me out. We always close the toilet lid before flushing, but contaminated water always splashes around when you wash your hands--usually next to the regular toothbrush holder. And, not everyone is trained to close the toilet lid before flushing.     This sanitizer alleviates those concerns. The holder can accomodate seven toothbrushes. We regularly keep two Sonicare electric toothbrushes and two regular toothbrushes in the sanitizer. It also has a handy tray in the sanitizer in which we keep the heads to our waterpics. The reason that I didn&#x27;t give this a five star is that  the piece that holds the toothbrushes and the tray are both plastic and I can see these someday wearing out and breaking.</li>
    <li> This unit is by far the best such device available to date.....you get excellent design &amp; good quality....at a reasonable price....plus it is easy to install....the ultra violet light comes on after you close the door...&amp; periodicly, ensuring your utensiles are sterile when needed....the unit holds your brushes upright so that any residual liquid drains down &amp; away from the head, ensuring a clean dry brush when next used...plus there is a fold out tray for sterilizing whatnots....i am well pleased with this purchase, two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I have had several products over the years that required standing toothbrushed up and the ensuing build up of gunk was discusting and hard to clean. This is attractive, easy to use, more versitile and stays much cleaner. A great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great sanitizer, I&#x27;ve had it nearly two years and haven&#x27;t had to change the bulb yet. I like the interchangeable rack too. The toothpaste holder or whatever it is on the side is kinda dumb to me. It is a lot bigger than I expected but it has a nice clean look overall and is sturdy with the stand. Not a cheap looking product which is nice because it stands out quite a bit on the countertop. I would suggest hanging it on a wall to keep out of your way if possible. As I mentioned, I bought the stand as well and though it is nice, it would be nice to not have to clean around it.</li>
    <li> Have had this product for 3 months with no problems. I have 5 electric toothbrushes and my fingernail clippers hanging in there getting clean i love it. The heads arent down facing in toothgunk and it doesnt pull off the wall with 5 heavy toothbrushes hanging like the suction cup holders. I definitly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few months ago and it has worked out perfectly for us.  As a previous reviewer stated, closing the door after you put your toothbrush back does start the unit and it will also run for 10 minutes every three hours and I have seen it do this so am satisfied it is working properly.  This time of year my kids in particular will have had several colds by now.  It dawned on me this morning that none of us are catching colds this season and that is always a plus!  I did a lot of research on this type of toothbrush sanitizer and am VERY happy this is the one I chose!  Try it.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best by far of all the units offered. Proper design &amp; with the added swing  out shelf for earings, water pic wands, etc. is bonus. I tried others,  this is far superior! The units that operate with the tooth brush head  in the down position are GROSS!</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit a month ago to replace my Violight unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through two Violights in less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the UVZ will be more durable (hope so), but it has many design superiorities over the Violight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important to me is the design where the toothbrushes hang down FROM the unit, rather than down INTO the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This keeps the unit cleaner as any drippings would fall away from the unit, rather than into it, so maintanence is nil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both times I examined the dead Violights I found lots of gunk (yuch) down by where the heads rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the UVZ holds seven toothbrushes versus the four of the Violight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UVZ also has a tray storage above the toothbrushes that pivots out to let you sterilize/store small utensils such as tweezers, nail clippers, small scissors, needles, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is well ventilated and the transparent door allows you to see the contents even when closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sterilization cycle is triggered by opening and shutting the door which is nice with little kids as you know the sanitizing will take place automatically every time a toothbrush is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also supposed to periodically run the sanitize process on it&#x27;s own, but I have never caught it doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are green and red function lights, green for stand by and red for active sanitizing although as you can see whether the UV lightbulb is on or not makes the indicators kind of redundant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a snap on external holder on the right side of the unit to hold a tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a couple of different style holders you can choose between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family uses the Braun Oral B electric toothbrush system and one of the UVZ holders is perfect, you just snap the brush heads, bristles forward into them and there is a small tab that fits the small hole on the forward side of the tooth brush heads to vertically align them with the UV sanitizing bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a simple system to mount the unit to the wall if desired, but I purchased the optional stand for it and that works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit looks good and works good, what more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, durability, well only time will tell on that one.desired, but I purchased the optional stand for it and that works great.    The unit looks good and works good, what more could you ask for?    Oh yeah, durability, well only time will tell on that one.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use with the optional stand.  The only downfall is the toothpaste holder, it tends to be easily removed with the tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew where to purchase additional bulbs.  It would be nice to have them in preparation of bulb failure.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a year ago. Love it. But now I do need a new toothbrush holder. The tooth brush holder does come out all the little prongs have broken off and I just want to replace it. Does anyone know where I can purchase just this part?????</li>
    <li> I had the violight unit where your toothbrushes sit head down in the unit. It really got disgusting and impossible to clean.&lt;br /&gt;This is so much better because it can be wall mounted or purchase a stand to place it on your counter.&lt;br /&gt;I just recently had to replace the bulb which lasted almost 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Finding a bulb was difficult. I did finally track one down so I thought I would post the info here so anyone that bought this unit will be able to get a replacement bulb.&lt;br /&gt;The bulb is EIKO 4W G4T5 Ultraviolet UV-C T5 Tube G.5 30 Volt Light Bulb which is available at lightbulbsurplus(.)com.&lt;br /&gt;I just received mine and while the bulb is difficult to get in, it does work.&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say that it is the same bulb that came with the unit, if you read the writing on the bulb, it is exact.</li>
    <li> Although I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s actually killing germs it seems to do what it&#x27;s suppose to.  I mounted it on the bathroom wall and it can accomodate any type of toothbrush we have including strange sized character brushes for the kids.  It turns on when you close the door and it does periodically turn on after the initial cleaning cycle.  Maybe it&#x27;s just that the weather is getting warmer or a coincidence but we do seem to be getting sick less since we started using this.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000G272VM UVZ Health Systems ESA302 Wall Mount Family Toothbrush Sanitizer]]    We put all tooth brushes, tongue scrapers and razors in this unit for their daily bug zapping.    With brances in my fifties, the Triumph tooth brush head are expensive to keep my braces clean.  I know that my tooth brush head is sanitized and ready to go.    Working in a hospital I know the importance of eliminating as many germs as possible so happy there is such a great product for home use.  No worries of the many germs and viruses that could potentially grow on any items placed in it.</li>
    <li> I bought it and want to put in the Master Room then It cames to realize that its too big for one area of the wall and never use it</li>
