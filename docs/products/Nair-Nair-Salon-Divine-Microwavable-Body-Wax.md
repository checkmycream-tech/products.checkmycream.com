      <li>THANKS SELLER FOR PROVIDING AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
      <li>Honestly, me and my 3 sisters and my cousins are also using this wax for a couple of years now</li>
      <li>/&gt;First - This product came nicely wraped with no defects and everything as mentioned was included.</li>
      <li>I am most happy with this Nair product; these are the best I&#x27;ve come across so far.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best wax I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Since it goes on warm, it opens your pores and allows the hair to come out more easily.</li>
      <li>and you will be hair free for three weeks!</li>
      <li>However once I was finally able to use it, the product wasn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I was glad to read up on the tips and</li>
      <li>I have a Scentsy warmer and I just put this Nair wax pot on top of it</li>
      <li>It also smells better and has a better consistency.  </li>
      <li>I love this, but I can never find it anymore.  </li>
      <li>I am looking to buy more of it.</li>
      <li>but most didn&#x27;t fully wax the area.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this wax ...</li>
      <li>I AM SO PLEASED</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
      <li>Best and only wax I use!</li>
      <li>I love this product now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried different products and this one works the best out of all types of wax.</li>
      <li>I love this wax.</li>
      <li>It works slightly better the hotter</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I tried this product after having a pretty good result with their disposal strips.</li>
      <li>Really great for sensitive skin!  </li>
      <li>Easy.</li>
      <li>Armpits are ridiculously easy to do.</li>
      <li>At this temp for a whole container I feel like one should warm it just a bit more so that the wax is easier applied and scooped by the aplicater (</li>
      <li>Which I guess is fine.</li>
      <li>The best place to use are armpits if you can wait it out for a little over 10 days then spread it in sections and take off</li>
      <li>More so in certain areas for sure.</li>
      <li>Baby powder makes a huge difference as well.</li>
      <li>The tub is huge and lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>and then nair free.</li>
      <li>I have tried many waxes for many years, and have always preferred this particular one when I can find it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every wax you can buy, and I keep coming back to this one because its easy, microwavable, and it smells good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a first time waxer and heard many horror stories</li>
      <li>I just love this product sooh much!.</li>
      <li>Best hard wax I have come across.</li>
      <li>on pocket compared to salon for full body wax</li>
      <li>Not bad, but not Orchid-y either.</li>
      <li>and it just feels like a quick sting</li>
      <li>so it became more liquidy, but then the wax would be too hot and cool too fast.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>There are no cloth strips, so you need to learn just the right thickness of product to use, but once you do, the process goes quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>hope this helps    Worth every cent</li>
      <li>I have 3-4 months worth of wax.....</li>
      <li>I think as far as microwaveable wax goes, you are better off using strip wax.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done my own waxing multiple times, and have never had a problem.</li>
      <li>Worth your money.</li>
      <li>At first I was a bit nervous using hot wax but as long as you follow the directions inside, all is good.  </li>
      <li>I know this says it works on short hair, and it will do an okay job on short hair, but anyone who understands anything about waxing knows that you need to grow your hair out for at least a good two weeks in order to get a great wax</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re limited by the number of sheets you have even if there is more wax available.</li>
      <li>The other waxes aren&#x27;t as clean, easy, and accurate.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most similar type of wax that I use in salons.  </li>
      <li>Why did you guys stop making it at first place?</li>
      <li>When you dab your hot glue and you pull the gun away what does it leave?</li>
      <li>and it never failed to give desirable results.</li>
      <li>Almost everyone has used a hot glue gun.</li>
      <li>When I first started waxing, I had no idea what I was doing and would end up with wax clumps stuck to my hairs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used wax strips before, but this was my first time trying the stripless wax.  </li>
      <li>The brand new tub was nice and liquidy after 4 minutes, I&#x27;d wait a little bit for it to cool to the right consistency and by that point the wax would be the right temperature to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Surprisingly it worked better on the fine peach fuzzy hairs on my upper lip, but still not great.     </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for hot wax users who don&#x27;t want to pay salon prices!</li>
      <li>Product was received fairly quickly which was nice, but had shaved a few days before because it was just getting to be too much.</li>
      <li>If you want a good hard microwaveable wax (such as for bikini lines), Surgi-wax is much better.</li>
      <li>I always make sure my skin is clean before waxing, and I apply a little baby powder to my skin before applying the wax.  </li>
      <li>other waxes are sticky and messy but this one is perfect!  </li>
      <li>If one is looking for a hot wax product that really works, this is it.</li>
      <li>But once you get past that things heat wise went</li>
      <li>This is a great hard wax!  </li>
      <li>It arrived within just a few days, and I&#x27;m soooo glad it did!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was recommended this product by two of my friends. I am terrible when it comes to waxing at home, and waxing at salon&#x27;s usually makes my skin break out even more. I don&#x27;t like creams either, because they usually leave a stubble. Threading also leaves my skin red and irritated. I have dark hair, so I can&#x27;t bleach it, therefore I didn&#x27;t have much options for hair removal. All you have to do is heat the jar in the microwaves, apply and peel it off. It is so simple and quick. It also has a great scent which is an added bonus!!</li>
    <li> Best hard wax I have come across. Really gets the thick hairs out. Reheats with no problem, and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax ever..and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore..Once you get used to waxing yourself it is the best product out there!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wax ... the way the wax is formulated, it grabs the hair, even short hair, without overly grabbing the skin, therefore less painful than professional waxing I have done and no irritation at all after waxing!  I tried this product after having a pretty good result with their disposal strips. The only down side is getting the residual wax off that is left behind on hands and skin ... the included wipes help, but are quite greasy.  But am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I AM SO PLEASED THIS WAX PRODUCT THIS IS EXTACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR EVERY SINCE RITE AID STOP SELLING THIS PARTICULAR ITEM... I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY THIS TIME AGAIN!!!!! THANKS SELLER FOR PROVIDING AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the money. If need to be in a budget. This is the one.  From my experience using this product, it&#x27;s the best there is.</li>
    <li> First time when I bought it I hated it. I had done everything wrong. damp skin, lotion,oily skin, not enough wax applied etc..I love this product now. For those who disliked this product,First of all the before I start I wash the skin with regular hand washing soap, wax has to be the right texture and consistency. secondly what worked for me was applying the wax in the opposite direction of the growth, it grabs the hair better that way. I also use it for my eyebrows and upper lip though not recommended in the box as far as I can remember. I also did my underarm. Very little pain and most of hair gone. Let me tell you I have very thick and coarse hair. the pulled strip looked like a forest yuck..But trial and error did work for me.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ! WORST WAX IVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE! THE MESSIEST WAX EVER I HAD TO SWEEP UP THE FLOOR AFTERWARDS! IT GETS ABSOLUTLEY EVERYWHERE STICKS TO YOUR FINGERS AND CLOTHES AND ONLY REMOVED 60 PERCENT OF MY HAIR THE REST I HAD TO SHAVE 2 DAYS LATER BECAUSE IT WAS SO IRRITATED! I had to keep reheating it because it worka beter when runny so i burnt my finger while testing it. Im so annoyed now i will have to wait for the waxed hair and shaved hair to grow out and when they do i will be using the strip wax which is much easier less messier .IF I COULD GIVE THIS 0 STAR I WOULD !</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s the best type of hair removal product out there and I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> This is a great hard wax!  I&#x27;ve tried just about every wax you can buy, and I keep coming back to this one because its easy, microwavable, and it smells good.  It works really well on thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used wax strips before, but this was my first time trying the stripless wax.  This worked better and hurt less.  Great!</li>
    <li> This product is works..   only thing I&#x27;m sad about is that it&#x27;s impossible to find it in stores.  Easy. Application, no mess, no strips, this really is Waxing for Idiots!!    I use this for my bikini &amp; underarm, occassionally my upper lip.  It&#x27;s gentle, and will save you a lot at the salon.  One tub generally lasts me 3 months    hope this helps    Worth every cent</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve tried different products and this one works the best out of all types of wax. It removes hair like nothing else.</li>
    <li> I love this wax. I used to use it in Germany and France and I had a hard time finding it here in local stores. I use this wax since years and I love it. Price is a little high though, I believe.</li>
    <li> It had been opened, used and disgusting! Item said it was new and unused. Very disappointed with this product, yuk</li>
    <li> I like this wax but I noticed that should has stripes and some of the short hairs is not removing comletely, maybe I do not have enough experience with this kind of wax.</li>
    <li> When I first started waxing, I had no idea what I was doing and would end up with wax clumps stuck to my hairs. If you do know how to wax, this product is absolutely amazing. It takes all my armpit hairs off and barely hurts-- it&#x27;s tolerable for me at least. Armpits are ridiculously easy to do. The private area is more tricky obviously, but as long as you apply in the direction of hair growth and pull in the opposite direction it will do wonders. Baby powder makes a huge difference as well. This wax grips the hairs really well and will remove practically everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that as I got halfway through the tub, it got harder to heat up! The brand new tub was nice and liquidy after 4 minutes, I&#x27;d wait a little bit for it to cool to the right consistency and by that point the wax would be the right temperature to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used up half the tub it got harder to use because the wax consistency just wasn&#x27;t the same after heating. Part of the wax would melt a little too thick, and the other wax would still be semi solid. When that happened I&#x27;d just stick in the microwave for longer so it became more liquidy, but then the wax would be too hot and cool too fast.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is because the wax got contaminated and oily from double dipping (it&#x27;s my private tub, I can do that) or if the wax just naturally gets harder to use after multiple heatings and coolings. It still works fine, it just got more annoying as I worked my way through the tub because when the wax was the right consistency, it would sometimes be a little too hot, and by the time it cooled enough, the consistency would be a little too thick. It was still usable that way though and now I am at the very bottom of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m going to use it again. Worth your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different brands of wax strips before but most didn&#x27;t fully wax the area.  I am most happy with this Nair product; these are the best I&#x27;ve come across so far.  At first I was a bit nervous using hot wax but as long as you follow the directions inside, all is good.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If one is looking for a hot wax product that really works, this is it. There are no cloth strips, so you need to learn just the right thickness of product to use, but once you do, the process goes quickly. It comes with only one spatula, so I buy my own supply and, for small places, use the ends of wooden chopsticks or ice cream sticks. The wax heats up in the microwave too, so you don&#x27;t have to wait forever for it to melt. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for hot wax users who don&#x27;t want to pay salon prices!</li>
    <li> The only at-home hair removal product I will use!  It&#x27;s the most similar type of wax that I use in salons.  Really great for sensitive skin!  I absolutely prefer this product over the kits with the sheets that are necessary to remove the wax - 1. that product can actually rip your skin off and you can&#x27;t go over the same area multiple times without irritation, 2. you&#x27;re limited by the number of sheets you have even if there is more wax available.</li>
    <li> It is the only home wax I will ever use. I&#x27;ve tried stuff with pre-made strips, cloth strips... you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. This wax is the best! Since it goes on warm, it opens your pores and allows the hair to come out more easily. As it cools, it gets really hard and isn&#x27;t tacky like lots of other brands. and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. My tip is to work small areas and use generously - do not put it on too thin.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this was so highly rated. I&#x27;ve done my own waxing multiple times, and have never had a problem. My hair usually comes out fairly easily, without leaving alot of strays. I usually use a sugar wax with strips, but since this wax was so well reviewed, I thought I would give it a shot.     It was messy, and only pulled out 50% of my leg hair, so I still ended up having to shave. It works slightly better the hotter you get it, but then you are pushing the limits of safety. Surprisingly it worked better on the fine peach fuzzy hairs on my upper lip, but still not great.     I think as far as microwaveable wax goes, you are better off using strip wax. You also end up using a lot less wax, because you can apply a thin layer and still remove it with the strip. With this wax, you have to apply it a little thick so you can actually pull it off without it breaking and leaving bits stuck all over you.     UGH! Don&#x27;t buy this wax. If you want a good hard microwaveable wax (such as for bikini lines), Surgi-wax is much better.</li>
    <li> I love this, but I can never find it anymore.  Looking for a microwaveable wax that I don&#x27;t need strips to use.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that works except for the Surgi brand but this hurts much less and is a better value because you get multiple uses out of it.  It also smells better and has a better consistency.  There are things you need to know: If it&#x27;s not working, you either put too much of the oil on before (use it VERY sparingly), you&#x27;re waxing in a room that&#x27;s too warm (think no AC in the summer or a steamy bathroom after a shower) or the hair just isn&#x27;t long enough.  I know this says it works on short hair, and it will do an okay job on short hair, but anyone who understands anything about waxing knows that you need to grow your hair out for at least a good two weeks in order to get a great wax (your hair should be about 3/4 of a cm long).  If you don&#x27;t want to grow it out that long, then waxing isn&#x27;t for you.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 3 years, and if you use it right, it&#x27;s really awesome.  I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with the product - rather that people don&#x27;t use it correctly.  You need decently long hair, VERY little oil, and a cool, dry room.  This is the only stuff that works for a brazillian - I wish it was easier to find!  I don&#x27;t understand how those wax kits with strips work - the only time i tried that it was a serious disaster.  Buy this stuff, use it properly, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 5 years now and it never seems to fail.  I have bought every kind of wax you can find at your regular supermarkets, yet this one is the most affordable and the less irritating I have used.  I used it on my face and body, and I love not having to worry about the mess that other waxes (with strips) will make.</li>
    <li> I can never find this wax anywhere. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll ever buy.  No fussing with wax strips and it works on those stubborn pubes. No other wax can to do that for me.  It arrived within just a few days, and I&#x27;m soooo glad it did!  Highly recommended to anyone who wants ALL the hair gone in one pull, instead of having to go over it over and over, and then still having to tweeze the rest. I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
    <li> The product did not do as it advertised, not only was it very painful and left my skin just as red and swollen as if I had gotten razor burn from a razor, it did not actually remove any hair. It worked on really really long hair, but it did nothing for the short hair. What am I supposed to do? Let my hair grow out long until I can use it? Totally defeats the purpose. Don&#x27;t buy this product, it is a lot of pain for no gain.</li>
    <li> Either you ARE a waxer or you&#x27;re NOT! I was desperate and my normal wax sold out @ Sally&#x27;s. So I just happened to cross this on clearance @ Target. I must say it is THE best wax I have ever used. I was never in favor of the muslin strips and this is perfect. Apply this is a downward motion. I count to 15 and rippppppp and it ALL comes off root $ all! I have paid $100&#x27;s of @ salons and for around 7 bucks I have 3-4 months worth of wax.....no comparison!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in target but they no longer carry it.  I know it says for body use but I only use it facially.  The tub is huge and lasts forever.  Does great in the microwave. Really gets those hard to get hairs! I refuse to use wax that involves a strip and this is the best that I&#x27;ve found  Please note: I have not used this product for all over waxing.</li>
    <li> Product was received fairly quickly which was nice, but had shaved a few days before because it was just getting to be too much. However once I was finally able to use it, the product wasn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First - This product came nicely wraped with no defects and everything as mentioned was included. When I opened it, the box had instructions written on it and a pamphlet which was very nice. I&#x27;m a first time waxer and heard many horror stories so I was glad to read up on the tips and warnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second - The wax doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything. Not bad, but not Orchid-y either. Which I guess is fine. No big deal. I warmed it up to the set temp and it created just as described, a &#x27;heated honey&#x27; like texture. At this temp for a whole container I feel like one should warm it just a bit more so that the wax is easier applied and scooped by the aplicater (Which is just a wooden popsickle stick which was a little annoying -.-) But once you get past that things heat wise went smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third - Very messy. Almost everyone has used a hot glue gun. When you dab your hot glue and you pull the gun away what does it leave? Strings. This wax is just like that and I had wax strings floating EVERYWHERE. o.o I found by twirling it around the popsickle stick like spaghetti kinda helped contain the mess but not a whole lot. It does clean up easy once you&#x27;ve made the mess so it wasn&#x27;t horrible, but its not as easy as many made it out to beleive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth - Once you swipe a layor across your desired waxed area its A. Quite difficult to leave a large enough glob at the end to be able to pull up on. With this little bit of knowledge, I&#x27;m thinking that perhaps using actual wax strips would be easier. If you could get a hold and were able to pull up, it was painful. More so in certain areas for sure. Its definatley different from person to person, and it suggests strait from the box to place some powder on your skin first which I&#x27;d suggest as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly - This product says that it will work even on short hair which isn&#x27;t exactly true. I used this product on my legs which I had kept unshaved for a few days so that I was even giving it the benefit, however, found out that even the length that it was (Perhaps 1/2 an inch long) the wax stips would only pull up little to none. In other areas where it was perhaps an inch long the product worked much better. Once you get past all these slightly annoying hurdles the product does work and two weeks later my skin is still bare. Its a bit patchy because I had to go back over with a razor in my newbie attempt, but it works with a little effort. I hope this helps, because I read a lot of reviews that just said it was BAD, or it&#x27;s GREAT buy five boxes... This will hopefully help you decide. And if this isn&#x27;t for you, then I&#x27;d suggest trying Nair&#x27;s waxing kit with strips or once of their other hair removal products instead. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to end up doing, after attempting this a little further.</li>
    <li> Nice item!! Fast shipping. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many waxes for many years, and have always preferred this particular one when I can find it. When I can&#x27;t seem to find it I get really bummed. The other waxes aren&#x27;t as clean, easy, and accurate. I can even reuse the wax if it&#x27;s not too hairy. But even then its only reusable a few times before it need be replaced. And now I always find a good deal on amazon.</li>
    <li> I need MORE!!! Can&#x27;t find anywhere!  other waxes are sticky and messy but this one is perfect!  Looks like they sell it in Europe but for a lot more $$!</li>
    <li> Are you serious you are charging it $39.99???? Why did you guys stop making it at first place? It was the best wax I have ever used and I still can not find one that is comparable, but you guys are overcharging your customers.</li>
    <li> Very convenient....I just love this product sooh much!. I don&#x27; t need the wax strip to remove all the hairs in my body like other waxes do. All you have to do is just put powder on the area you want to wax and then spread the wax using the flat wooden stick. Honestly, me and my 3 sisters and my cousins are also using this wax for a couple of years now and it never failed to give desirable results.I have already recommended this wax to my sis-in-laws and friends. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Product is Not enough or one leg itself.&lt;br /&gt;2. Clean up afterwards is difficult, even when you have newsaper on bathroom floor.&lt;br /&gt;3. Ripped my skin off in two places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Easy on pocket compared to salon for full body wax</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am unable to find it in stores in my area.&lt;br /&gt;.No pain, need no brains,&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to use.</li>
    <li> I like this wax over all others I have used in the past. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Best and only wax I use!</li>
    <li> For years I have been battling with the side effects of PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), mainly excessive hair growth on my upper lip and chin.  I need to wax weekly and going to the hair salon every week is out of my budget and not to mention embarrassing.  I have tried countless remedies to remove the hair: tweezing, waxing with strips, that metal coil you roll over your skin, and none of them work as well as Nair Salon Divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of this product include: (1) easy to use: just apply, wait 20 seconds, and pull.  (2) works extremely well on short hair, such as the upper lip and chin areas.  (3) no strips that you need to wash afterwards to re-use.  (4) leaves the skin feeling soft and exfoliated.  (5) done waxing in minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons of this product include: (1) can&#x27;t re-use the same strip.  (2) doesn&#x27;t work well on long hair, such as the arms and legs.  (3) as the level of wax in the tub goes down you need to heat it up longer and it tends to cool down faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rate this product a 4.  If it worked just as well on my arms, it would have gotten a 5.  But I definitely recommend this product and will continue to purchase it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an additional note... I always make sure my skin is clean before waxing, and I apply a little baby powder to my skin before applying the wax.  The baby powder helps the wax grab the hair and not my skin.  It also helps prevent burns if I accidentally heat it up too much.</li>
    <li> It seems that this product was discontinued, but it is so wonderful! I am looking to buy more of it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t make a mess while you are doing it, it takes the hair from the roots, leave you skin nice and smooth without hair, and the wax last for about 15-20 days.&lt;br /&gt;What I most like about this product is that you don&#x27;t need to use stripes, once you apply it, you will pull it, and then it is done!</li>
    <li> I started buying this last year and it was bogo at a drugstore. I am just finishing my last tub so woo long lasting! The best place to use are armpits if you can wait it out for a little over 10 days then spread it in sections and take off and you will be hair free for three weeks! And no bumps or hairs coming back overnight either. I have used on the inner highs and and groin area and it just feels like a quick sting and then nair free. I wish I could use in the whole area there but have looser skin. I also use on lip and eyebrows but you need to get a little practice if it&#x27;s new to you. This stuff is harder to find so just get it! Set aside about an hour to do it right and remove any excess with a simple baby oil because it has a mineral oil base that eats through the wax to dissolve!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best wax I have ever used. I used to try waxing with the fabric strips and it would frequently leave hairs behind that I would have to keep going back to but this stuff gets every hair every time. Even when I think the hair is too short to wax it will still get almost all of them! It is fairly idiot proof, just heat it up (not too hot), spread it on and pull off! I did have a bit of a hard time at first but then you figure out the right consistency, right thickness, to leave a lip on the end to pull and how long to wait until you pull. If you wait too long it will break off and if u pull too soon it will be super gooey and won&#x27;t pull the hair out. I have a Scentsy warmer and I just put this Nair wax pot on top of it so I don&#x27;t have to keep going back and forth to the microwave. Now I am a waxing machine and there isn&#x27;t anything I won&#x27;t wax myself!!</li>
