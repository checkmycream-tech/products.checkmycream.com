<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! And for the price....unreal purchase.</li>
    <li> This item works exactly like I thought it would.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> bought on the suggestion of a dentist who said it is better at getting below the gumline than regular brushing.&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing as good a job as I can manually, but maybe it is?&lt;br /&gt;Still, with battery-operated toothbrushes under $10, I can&#x27;t imagine that this one, just because it&#x27;s rechargeable is worth&lt;br /&gt;that much more in regard to it&#x27;s effectiveness (?)&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll know in 6 months at n ext checkup</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! Super quick shipping too.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, I never knew my teeth could be so clean!</li>
    <li> Works very well. My wife uses it, that&#x27;s why I got it in pink. She loves it and uses it every day, obviously.</li>
    <li> Great color and it cleans very well. It also comes with a travel case.</li>
    <li> I can go no where without my soniccare.  If you are thinking about getting one, just do it.  It takes a few days to get used to the feeling of a electric toothbrush, but once you do it is simply amazing.  On my last 6 month cleaning, it took them just a couple seconds and I was out of the chair, she noticed my teeth were remarkably cleaner than prior visits.</li>
    <li> I think I got a faulty one because water leaks inside and it makes for high maintenance/cleaning.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush very much. The only added option I wish it had was the pause feature every 30 seconds. I bought this as a replacement I had for the Sonicare Essence (which I had for like 7 years) and that one stopped for maybe half a second every 30 seconds to signal you to move to a different spot. It didn&#x27;t take me long to adjust!</li>
    <li> Looks and works great. Leaves me teeth with the just left the dentist feeling everyday.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. My only concern is that it doesn&#x27;t have any settings and turns off automatically at 2 minutes. I would have liked to have the option of different timing settings of vibration speeds.</li>
    <li> not sure if this is best toothbrush ever but it certainly is thorough and helped me get the back of my mouth much more clean than before, that said, it really tickles to a degree that makes it a little uncomfortable to use, at least for me. Maybe it&#x27;s that 31000 brushstrokes per second? That&#x27;s a lot.</li>
    <li> IT BROKE!!!! I will never buy stuff from philips again. It just stopped working after three months I got it. As an international buyer, I could not return it or get it repaired. I hate it.</li>
    <li> Have used this for a year now and I can honestly say that it works great.  My dentist thinks I floss!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and her husband liked it so I bought one . A bit too strong for me though but everyone has a different sensitivity level .</li>
    <li> I like this, it makes me like to wash my teeth</li>
    <li> Love this product. My teeth feel the best they&#x27;ve ever felt, and I get better check ups when at the dentist.</li>
    <li> The base is clunky but its great for what I paid for it!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush. My teeth are very clean after using it. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Very good. Had one several years old.&lt;br /&gt;Todd was a replacement. I&#x27;m s retired Dentist so I know they work. Used to recommend them to my patients.</li>
    <li> Ive had this tooth brush a year now and its still working great! My teeth feel so clean and even have gotten whitter. The charge holds about a week at a time, so is great for travel. I went back for a cleaning and my dentist said I had hardly any plaque build up. This unit also is timed and syops after few minutes.</li>
    <li> This was the best price (with my $5 off code) for this Philips Sonicare I could find anywhere. I like that they had an option for this cute pink bubble design too! My dentist recommended Sonicare for getting under the gums to keep the plaque away. Flossing can&#x27;t get to where this does the work. I&#x27;m looking forward to a good report at my next cleaning!</li>
    <li> good buy but clumsy for a female hand .</li>
    <li> A well made product. I have had several of these before.&lt;br /&gt;They work well and last for years.&lt;br /&gt;All you need to do is replace the brush every 3 months.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so clean! It goes for two minutes; I always feel I need a little more time than that, so just turn it on again. My husband loves his, too!</li>
    <li> I think this really helps you brush for a full 2 minutes with the timer.  I haven&#x27;t gotten any more cavities since switching to this toothbrush.  The head is nice and small, so you can reach the back corners of your teeth.  Also the charge lasts a long time; I can go a week easily without needing to recharge.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works great and is rechargeable.  The brush heads are pretty expensive though.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes</li>
    <li> been using this brush for years . Not this exact one but always liked this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little tough to get used to the intensity of the tooth brush at first but it definitely leaves your mouth feeling clean</li>
    <li> Works really well....I like the travel case.&lt;br /&gt;Much lighter than previous versions of the sonicare toothbrush and smaller head size to get back teeth</li>
    <li> When I shelled out thousands for braces for my three kids, and two months in, the orthodontist said their brushing was seriously lacking, I splurged and bought them all this toothbrush.  The fact that it runs for two minutes keeps them brushing for as long as they should, and no more negative reports from the dentist or orthodontist.  My oldest had been developing some gingivitis because his brushing wasn&#x27;t adequate, but no more issues with that.  We haven&#x27;t had any new cavities since purchasing these- I think that result is a combination of the fact that my kids are brushing longer (because of the 2 minute timer) and that their brushing is now way more effective due to the sonicare technology.  All three of my kids find it much easier to blast stuff out of their braces with this brush as opposed to a manual brush or other electric toothbrushes that work with a spinning head motion.&lt;br /&gt;I also have one, and I honestly don&#x27;t know how I EVER thought my teeth were clean before I started using this.  If you take the plunge and purchase a sonicare, be prepared to take it with you wherever you go, because you will literally NEVER be able to go back to using a manual toothbrush ever again.  Busts through plaque and that gross morning film like nobody&#x27;s business. Took a little getting used to the vibrating sensation, but this brush busts plaque and I now get compliments that my teeth look very white- even though I don&#x27;t use whitening products.  I brush a full two-minute cycle on the top, and a full cycle on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change brush heads, wipes clean easily.  I&#x27;ve never fully submerged it (I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;d kill it, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not recommended) but it withstands the occasional rinsing off under a stream of tap water without the internal parts getting wet.&lt;br /&gt;The pink design makes it easy for my daughter to identify her toothbrush from her brother&#x27;s, and she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Used twice daily, I only need to charge about every other week.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads are a little pricey, but so worth it for the difference this makes.</li>
    <li> After a year with this product mine is working great only needed to charge a couple times. The second ordered for my daughter will not recharge. She just started using hers due to braces and a manual tooth brush being more comfortable. Very disappointed considering cost.</li>
    <li> it works very well and can brush teeth very well and clean, and I like it very much. Definitely I will suggest my friend get one too.</li>
    <li> Decided I like this toothbrush / No complaints</li>
    <li> Perfect product, has instantly became part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s 6am I go to brush my teeth and in the process of making sure the damn thing doesn&#x27;t have BLACK MOLD GROWING inside of the piece that goes in my mouth I get the POS cover for the brush, which just so happens to fit perfectly inside part of the infamous &#x27;black mold area&#x27;TM&#x27; stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NBD right? I thought so too, until I realized just how far in the piece got pushed, and my apparent lack of needle nose pliers doesn&#x27;t help one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But come on folks buy this brush its a good deal. Just order an extra one of some needle nose pliers for when you get the plastic stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to go back to manual brush now because money is tight. I will be saving up to replace my brush with a more expensive model for 100% sure because its something I need and use every single day, and you really can&#x27;t beat electric, but it WILL NOT be a Philips.</li>
    <li> Never had an electric toothbrush before. Makes your mouth feel very clean, it cleans much better than a regular toothbrush. Get one!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> RINSE THIS TOOTHBRUSH after every use because it&#x27;s waterproof!!!!! You rinse a manual toothbrush after you use it, right? Do the same with this electric one. This is all I do to keep away the rusting, bacterial growth, and grime that many reviewers have experienced.  I have used this Sonicare for over a year, and it still looks brand new.  I even use it in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean in under 15 secs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) After each use, unscrew the brushhead and turn it upside down.  Hold the brushhead under running water, fill up the hollow area with water, swish water around, dump water, and repeat until clean. Should only take 5 seconds to get the post-toothbrushing gunk out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Rinse the toothbrush base under running water. Fill up the hollow area (that the brushhead goes into), swish water around, dump water, and repeat until clean. Only takes 5 seconds. To check, just stick your finger in to see if you feel anything sticky like toothpaste still left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) DO NOT put a wet brushhead back on the base or it will rust!! Just lay the toothbrush base FLAT on a paper towel. Then LEAN the brushhead on top of it at an angle (See 1st attached photo). This way, the water can drain out of the brushhead and will not rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila! Clean and non-rusty toothbrush after 1 year still (2nd attached photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tip: I went through brushheads fairly quickly at first because I kept pressing them down on my teeth while brushing. Remember, this is not a manual brush so you don&#x27;t need to exert any pressure when brushing! Just place it lightly on your teeth; it will exert force itself.  Just place your finger lightly on the vibrating brushhead and you&#x27;ll see what I mean!</li>
    <li> Broke after three months and neither Amazon or the manufacturer will send a replacement.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. This is my second one now, the first one lasted me for years. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT, I WAS USING A BATTERY OPERATED LOW PRICE TOOTHBRUSH BEFORE. A FRIEND BOUGHT THIS BEFORE ME AND SAID THERE WAS A LARGE DIFFERENCE IN THE TOOTHBRUSH AND I SHOULD TRY IT. SHE WAS RIGHT. BEEN USING FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW AND CAN&#x27;T FIND ANYTHING WRONG!!!</li>
    <li> Great product very easy to use stays charge for a long time very easy to clean and to store in my medicine cabinet</li>
    <li> I picked up my first one in &#x27;08 and I actually struggle using regular toothbrushes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this one up for the girlfriend because it is so freaking simple and does such a great job, it&#x27;s incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t have bad teeth. She would buy those Colgate crap AA electric toothbrushes and they&#x27;d break. Constantly. So after her going through like 8 of them, I picked this up for her last Xmas. She loves it like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, for the price on this it is so worth it. I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular brush.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. I could not find replacement heads for his previous sonicare, so I bought a replacement toothbrush instead. He is very happy with this.</li>
    <li> My daughter was getting braces and needed something to assist her in brushing her teeth better.  This has done the trick.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, works as advertised!</li>
    <li> So disappointed two months after I purchase my new sonicare which is my second this year and it stops working I honestly think that water is able to get inside of the handle and it stops working, both times this has happened , not wasting my money anymore in this.</li>
    <li> It did not have the 30 second timer on it.but other then that it works like the one I replaced</li>
    <li> This makes your teeth feel like you&#x27;ve just been to the dentist for a cleaning.  It is a little bulky to hold to small hands, but works and charges great!</li>
    <li> Lost one of these and bought another right away because I love these brushes!! They get the job done and scrub my gums well while I am brushing. Very good! And it&#x27;s pink! Love the pink.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I was needing</li>
    <li> I love it! If you can brush the full two minutes, your mouth will feel like the dentist just cleaned it, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> My first electric toofbrush, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others. However it&#x27;s comfortable and very efficient. Love the timer, love that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;over charge&amp;#34; when charging. I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months, and already my brother has purchase one too.</li>
    <li> I cant brush with anything else after using this.</li>
    <li> I have been a sonic care user for many years and loved my toothbrush.  My original Sonic care was a gift and I had it for about 6yrs + before it stopped working.  I purchased this one through Amazon (new) to replace my original Sonic care.  I have used the toothbrush for about a month now and the power seems to be diminishing already and I can feel the difference.  This product did not live up to Sonic care standard.</li>
    <li> I love my pink toothbrush!!! It stays charged for a pretty long time also. I only have to charge it maybe once a month or so. I lost the cover to the brush head down the drain though so I am upset with myself for that lol. Anyways, I like that it is programmed for 2 minute brushing intervals. That&#x27;s a good thing. Also, this brush comes in a variety of colors on different websites so your not forced to buy a red, blue or green brush if you don&#x27;t want it. Just make sure you unscrew it from time to time and clean the buildup that forms inside. I&#x27;m very satisfied. Came with a nifty little travel case as well. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a nice toothbrush for the money, but I have to unscrew the top part slightly to reduce the vibration. Otherwise, it&#x27;s like putting a jackhammer in my mouth. I might eventually trade up for a model that has more settings, but this one is working fine for me for now.</li>
    <li> It leaves my teeth super clean! It&#x27;s been already a while since I have it and keeps working very well!</li>
    <li> This sonic toothbrush is fine. I had an Oral B sonic toothbrush before this one and loved it but it died and Oral B no longer makes it. This one was a great price and the functionality and feel of it is fine but not great. Comparing it to my previous toothbrush this is what I don&#x27;t like - this has no 30 second or 2 minute alert, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a 30 second alert doesn&#x27;t really bother me but it just stops at 2 minutes. My previous toothbrush alerted you at 2 minutes but didn&#x27;t stop. It is just so abrupt when it stops, I don&#x27;t like that. This toothbrush also seems to have a much stronger vibration or maybe it&#x27;s the brush head itself. It doesn&#x27;t feel as nice - sorry I can&#x27;t describe it better. I think will try the sensitive brush head when this one wears out and see if that one feels better as some other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I don&#x27;t like, and I knew it when I bought it, is the cost of the replacement heads. They are expensive and seem to be overkill. I wish you could just replace the top part instead of the whole big thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - it&#x27;s a good toothbrush and for the price it&#x27;s very good. I don&#x27;t regret buying it I&#x27;m just not delighted with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8 year old daughter who wanted her own sonicare.  Now no more confusing them.</li>
    <li> I like the toothbrush - like how it builds up speed to build you up.  Good price and the brand that my dentist recommends!</li>
    <li> Love this my teeth feel so much cleaner love the fact that it turns off after two minutes now I don&#x27;t have to think about how long I&#x27;m brushing</li>
    <li> Changed my life.  Teeth fgeel like I just came out of the dental hygienist</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without one of these. Previously had a double AA battery fed and this one is even better.</li>
    <li> This replaces my first sonicare, which would no longer hold a charge.  No quad pacer on this one, but I&#x27;m not sure I really need it.  If you&#x27;ve never owned a sonicare toothbrush, you&#x27;ve missed out!  If your dentist scolds you for pressing too hard when you brush, this will solve the problem, and your mouth will be and feel cleaner!</li>
    <li> Not the best Sonic, but definitely good for the money spent.  I use it twice a day and it is holding up well, and cleaning my teeth.  Definitely, better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great price on this! Great for braces, too! My daughter is very happy with this toothbrush and it came with coupons for refill heads.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! Everytime after I use it I feel like I just came out ofthe dentist! It feels so fresh and clean</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Philips Sonicare!  It does a thorough job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> Nothing to be surprised of here.  It works as advertised.  By clipping the on page coupon, it was only $30.  What a bargain!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- well built,&lt;br /&gt;- inexpensive,&lt;br /&gt;- cleans teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- requires cleaning every now and then,&lt;br /&gt;- replacement brush heads more expensive than for other models.</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush! I graduated from a manual one and couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did! It still tickles but I&#x27;m getting used to it :)</li>
    <li> I always cringe when my wife tells me she needs a new electronic or device like this, because her only concern or demand is that is has to be &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; which usually means pink or purple.  I have found very few quality &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; tech type devices they are usually a gimmick unless you can luck into finding a good company who did a breast cancer promotion (pink ribbons count on the cuteness scale)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hours of research I found that the more expensive models and brands are just that... More expensive.  as long as it has the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; vibrations they clean just about the same and they are the best as far as tooth brush technology and for those that can&#x27;t stand the vibrations the spinning ones are not as good but still better then a standard toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who needs a new sonic toothbrush cute or not this is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star for cost of replacement heads, be aware they are pretty spendy</li>
    <li> Must have item for those concerned with oral hygiene. My dentist recommended it. I highly recommend that you buy this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Best, most affordable electric toothbrush that I&#x27;ve ever owned!!! I&#x27;ll never pay hundreds of dollars for an electric toothbrush ever, again!! I absolutely love this Sonicare toothbrush &amp; highly recommend it to anyone &amp; everyone!!! Amazon has a great price on this product, they packaged it up nicely for adequate protection during the shipping process, &amp; it arrived at my house just 3 days after I ordered it! Two thumbs too Amazon &amp; Sonicare on this order/product!! You both rock like rockstars!!! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this specific model to me on numerous visits to the dentist office. She said it works just as well as much more expensive models.  I didn&#x27;t think it would make a big difference over manual brushing, but it really does. I don&#x27;t know what the more expensive models are like, but the Essence toothbrush makes my teeth feel as clean as they do right after a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sort of rounded, oddly-shaped teeth that are harder to clean, so I think if you&#x27;re also in that boat, this would be very helpful for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid about $30 for this toothbrush since Amazon had a coupon for it at the time I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only semi-con I can think of is that I don&#x27;t bother packing it to take on trips - even though it comes with a cute little travel case - I just take a little manual travel toothbrush. Maybe that says more about my own hygiene than how great the Essence is, I don&#x27;t know. I like to pack light, so I don&#x27;t like the extra room it takes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great gadget. I would totally buy it again and I&#x27;ll get a new one when this one&#x27;s life is over.</li>
    <li> I wish it had the beeps every 30 seconds and my name is Carol not Tinny.  Otherwise the toothbrush is great!!</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare toothbrush could not be used anymore. Not that it died, the on/off button wore down, and left opening which would let water inside surely causing problems.  This new one works perfectly.  Heave used Sonicare for years now, would not go back to old manual ever.</li>
    <li> I love this electric toothbrush! It makes my teeth feel super clean after I use it. I do recommend unscrewing the top and cleaning the inside of the holder with alcohol as it collects water and toothpaste and can end up growing mold inside. Yuck! Other than that, this is a great toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth very clean. The vibration is super strong. Very handy to travel with. Could not ask for more</li>
    <li> Got home followed all the directions and it died with in a week. The light just flashes and won&#x27;t turn on. Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Philips Sonicare HX5630/50 Essence Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush Pink, for several months now.  I love it because it. The 2  minute timer is a nice feature.  After I brush my teeth, it feels just as it does when I come from the dentist after getting my teeth cleaned. So glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my father as a gift and he has said it is the best electronic toothbrush he has ever hard, not to mention he loves that it is rechargeable.  Kind of hard to write an in-depth review on this one since it was a gift, I may buy one for myself after my Waterpik one goes out.  He highly recommends this one.</li>
    <li> My periodontist recommended a Sonicare toothbrush as I have periodontal disease. I had been using another brand for several years. I was really surprised at how different the sonicare was. I thought electric toothbrushes were all the same. Not so! Sonicare is totally different. I am glad I made the change. After only weeks of use I feel I am getting a handle on my gum disease. I highly recommend getting a Sonicare!</li>
    <li> satisfied with the product. no problems</li>
    <li> Love my new toothbrush and color. I can feel the difference from brushing this and from a regular tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Charges well and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I have more trouble handling this one in comparison with the Sonicare Elite I had for years.  It does the great job of brushing but a few small details in the handling &amp; finding the off button are taking time to get used to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush for the price! I had a more expensive version that died and this was a great affordable replacement option. The only thing that would make it better would be if it had a compact head.</li>
    <li> It was a 29th wedding anniversary (replacement) tooth brush for my wife and she was happily surprised and loves it!  I look forward to seeing her pearly whites for another 29 years!</li>
    <li> Okay best buy so far besides my mattress cover. I even have one for my four year old and she doesn&#x27;t make a fuss anymore because it&#x27;s time to brush her teeth. I love it. Even my other girls go straight to the bathroom to brush their teeth and they look like never before. I should have gotten these years ago:)</li>
    <li> Used Sonicare for years.  Works great and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Recommend it to all my friends for years.  great</li>
    <li> This model only offers the two minute timer, not the 30-second one for each quadrant of the teeth that my last model has. Be aware that the nextr model now sold uses a different brush head.</li>
    <li> This works great! I feel like my teeth are as clean as when I leave the dentist office from getting them cleaned :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the top of the line of Philips Sonicare for 9 years, to me I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the to.  I don&#x27;t keep mine in the charger, it holds the charge for a very long time. Just love it !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was recommended by my dentist . I love it. The graduated intensity is great. The travel bag is a great idea. I used to have a Braun, which was good but this tops it. Nothing bad to say. !!</li>
    <li> unlike previous models owned, this unit has a two minute timer for a full brushing, but no 30-second timer to help you distribute your brushing time to each quadrant of your mouth.  regardless, the unit does it&#x27;s job, holds a long charge, and comes at a wonderfully low price.</li>
    <li> Not this one. It has no power &amp; was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush it is really nice and it arrived really fast thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush I am prone to cavities ever time I go to the dentist she would alway tell me I had a cavity or two but this time I asked her how many I had and she replied 0 this toothbrush really helps me it is the best $50 I ever spent my kids even love brushing now as long as they can use moms</li>
    <li> it works great. it&#x27;s the one did a great job and comfortable. .I recommend this because it&#x27;s easy and basic.</li>
    <li> After I got braces I decided to upgrade from the Crest Spinbrush I have been using for years.  After reading a lot of reviews, I decided on the Philips Sonicare.  The vibrations take a little while to get used to but I feel that my teeth get much cleaner than if I was to use a manual toothbrush.  It holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> My family and I are very fond of Philips Sonicare HX5630， I would recommend a friend to use this, the teeth helpful</li>
    <li> Replaced my former Philips Sonicare but did not pay attention that this model lacks pulse timers.</li>
    <li> The head and it&#x27;s ease of removal and attaching it back is why I love this toothbrush.  The build quality is high and the design is well thought out.  The base is stable and flat which makes it easy to clean.  My teeth feel nice and clean with this one.</li>
    <li> I love my toothbrush, this is actually a replacement for one that I wore out.  I&#x27;m a big advocate for Sonicare and have been using for years.  I even have my special needs kiddo using the Sonicare products as well and he&#x27;s not had any problems with this teeth.</li>
    <li> I bough this for my wife.  She has been pushing too hard with the regular tooth brush.  She loves the tingling feeling she gets after using this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely nothing negative to say about Philips  Sonicare toothbrush. I bought the first one in 2004 and had to replace it this year. Anything that lasts 10 years, is easy to use, improves my dental health and saves me money is great in my opinion. My dental check ups improved immediately after I started using this product.</li>
    <li> For the price this is great!! didn&#x27;t need all the fancy stuff and this work just as well. save the money and buy this.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing and has a great battery life! Oh how did I live with my teeth before I got this toothbrush? You know that totally smooth, clean feeling you get just after visiting the dentist? Well that is the feeling this toothbrush gives you. It took a little getting used to, because I had never had an electric toothbrush before, but now the regular toothbrushes are the ones that seem weird.  If you want to still have teeth when you are old, take good care of them now.  With a toothbrush like this, I know I will have my teeth till I die!</li>
    <li> Even our dentist noticed a difference! An awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Sonicare, I purchased another since my old one was 10 years old and the battery was having issues keeping a charge.  I went with the Essence since it seemed like my old one.....but it&#x27;s not.  This is what the now consider &amp;#34;entry&amp;#34; level and some of the features I was used to I no longer have.  For your first Sonicare toothbrush this is great.</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever! I was a skeptic, but I will never go back to manual brushing again...it does not begin to compare to the clean feeling I get with this brush!  Price was unbeatable and the color is adorable!  :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice toothbrush. Took a little getting used too being that it was my first electronic toothbrush. The head was a little smaller then I expected but all around I&#x27;m very pleased with it</li>
    <li> Hi All&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering this toothbrush I would definitely make the investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not terribly expensive and after using it for a few months I really do feel like my teeth are cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that clean feeling seems to last longer then it used to with my old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassandra</li>
    <li> My grand daughter was so happy to get it.  And because they go to the cabin a lot the brush and carrying case works really.</li>
    <li> I loved it while it worked, but within 9 months it quit holding a charge, and it is now completely dead within 12 months. So sad.</li>
    <li> Love this Toothbrush, my teeth feel very clean. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 82 year old technologically handicapped Mother, who does everything &#x27;old school&#x27;, and she absolutely loves this toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> Love this, really removes the plaque buildup. Has a timer so you know you have brushed long enough. And it&#x27;s way more affordable than dentist bills and cavities!!</li>
    <li> Always wanted to get one of these and I finally did wow its been about a week and all I can say is AWESOME!!!  I thought I was brushing my teeth until I used this it is amazing ....everyone should own a sonic toothbrush!!!!</li>
    <li> The Product description is accurate and you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> Least expensive model, but works fine for the purpose.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush lasted 3 months...unacceptable. I think amazon is selling sub par merchandise. I&#x27;ve had previous Sonicares purchased at target and they&#x27;ve lasted over 6 years....this toothbrush is acting the same as the one I&#x27;m replacing that is over 6 years old!</li>
    <li> Huge improvement in a few short weeks!  Teeth are cleaner &amp; whiter!  Our grand-daughter loves brushing her teeth now!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Too bulky and heavy to hold. The brush is too soft and the vibration is too strong. There is no option to control the vibration like other electronic toothbrushes. My teeth never feel fully clean after using this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift to replace a VERY old unit of the same brand and style. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Box was once opened and then parts removed and taped shut&lt;br /&gt;Gas to send back&lt;br /&gt;Never gad a chance to use product</li>
    <li> I have two of these. One in the shower and one at the sink (in my bedroom). What can I say except that my teeth always feel so much cleaner after I use these. This model has an &amp;#34;acclamation&amp;#34; feature that starts out slower and builds the speed gradually so you can get used to it before it goes at all out speed. So far I&#x27;ve not experienced any problems with mine. I would by again and recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> Great price, good toothbrush.  My only complaint is that all the gunk gets down inside the handle and you have to really scrub that out frequently.  That&#x27;s the only downside or it would have five stars.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush needs to be taken apart and cleaned after each use otherwise gunk collects and bacteria grows inside the canister.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare HX5630/50 Essence Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush Pink</li>
    <li> For some reason as a teenager I swore off electric toothbrushes and went old-school. At a recent trip to the dentist (after not going for 4 years), they suggested I start using an electric toothbrush to strengthen my gums and get a better clean, and told me this was the best one. It works so well and my teeth feel so much cleaner now. It&#x27;s so convenient to travel with too!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush!  I love it!  Makes your teeth feel nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny great idea for kids. The built in time is ideal for everyone</li>
    <li> Excellent Price. $30 w/ the coupon. My dentist&#x27;s office tried to convince me to purchase one from them for $90 (including the rebate). What a bunch of s###. Very happy, my teeth feel lovely.</li>
    <li> I like how small the brushheads are but I honestly prefer the dual action available in other electric brushes which unfortunately tend to be much bigger. I got this on sale because retail is a bit high not including refills and because my dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that I did not read the product description more carefully to discover this toothbrush does not have quadrapacer like my other Sonicare brushes. This is a good toothbrush for the money, but the brushes with quadrapacer are worth the extra investment. Quadrapacer prompts you with a gentle sound and vibration to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth every 30 seconds to evenly disperse the two minutes of brushing. I will use this one for travel &amp; I needed a second charger, so all is not lost.&lt;br /&gt;As for those of you who don&#x27;t like the gunk that gets inside the handle, I agree. It&#x27;s a pain to clean out. That&#x27;s why I bought the Sonic Seal on Amazon some years ago. It&#x27;s basically a condom for your toothbrush. It goes on over the brush and covers the crack between the brush and handle, so nothing gets inside. Genius idea! Unfortunately these are no longer available on Amazon, although the information is still available so you can at least see what it looks like.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Holds a charge for almost a couple of weeks. Probably shouldn&#x27;t charge it until it dies to prolong battery life. Just be sure to unscrew the brush after every use to let it dry out or it gets gross in there. You can also charge it without the brush screwed on. My teeth feel much cleaner than with my regular brush. This is the least expensive model, I believe, but you don&#x27;t need anything the fancier ones have. 2 minute timer is just fine for me. The first couple of times you use a Sonicare it feels strange and tickles but for some reason that goes away after a couple times. Not sure if you would want to use this with super sensitive gums though.</li>
    <li> I love my cute sonic toothbrush I can already tell a difference in my teeth in just a week!</li>
    <li> Love having color options for kids.</li>
    <li> Wow, my teeth usually only feel this clean after seeing a dental hygienist! I had been using Braun electric toothbrushes for many years but was getting tired of the bad battery life. My sister recommended this and I am very impressed! It has even managed to remove some of the tea stains from the back of my lower teeth. It tickled a little at first, but didn&#x27;t take long to get used to. Great toothbrush and design. One thing that would have improved it: the built-in timer for 2 minutes is great, but I miss the way my old toothbrush would pause after every 30 seconds so it was easier to allocate equal time on all of your teeth. Other than that it is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love the idea of it but the bristles wear down too fast. I&#x27;m a soft brusher so its not like I&#x27;m brushing too hard either.</li>
    <li> Fast service -good item.</li>
    <li> Easy to put together and use.  I honestly felt like I was missing some areas when I tried to do one 2-minute cycle on both the top and bottom teeth, so I now do a 2-minute cycle on the top and another 2-minute cycle on the bottom.  Makes my teeth feel like I just felt the dentist&#x27;s office.  The lights easily indicate when it needs to be recharged and when it is fully charged.  Very easy to understand without even reading the instructions.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works awesome, the perfect power for my teeth. Love it</li>
    <li> Was just we ordered. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Manual tooth brushes have nothing on this!</li>
    <li> Love it! Teeth have never felt so clean after home brushing. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift and the recipient loved it. I have one of my own and the only reason I give it 4 stars is because the replacement brushes are around $10 a piece, which seems a bit steep. I could live with $6 or $7 but $10 seems like a lot.</li>
    <li> Had it for less than 8 months and now it wont hold a charge.  I did speak to Philips Support and they did replace the hand unit.  But that replacement does not hold a charge either.  Im done with SoniCare,  This isnt the first time Ive purchased a sonicare product to have it fail before its time.</li>
    <li> Love this Sonicare. Bought this as a backup.</li>
    <li> good deal, does its job, cute color!</li>
    <li> Very useful and must for all. Amazon promoted sell by providing coupons, best value for money. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After I use this toothbrush my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist!!  I definitely recommend trying it out!</li>
    <li> I bought one for my wife, then one for me.  We both love it.  It takes some getting used too, but we quickly took to using it.  Dont wet the toothpaste and it will create less mess on the handle.  I found cheap replacement heads at new egg online but they go onsale all over for $10 a piece.  There is a colored wear indicator on the bristles that shows when to replace (recommended every three months).</li>
    <li> first my bought blue one is good but this is no good</li>
    <li> This brush feels like I&#x60;ve had my teeth cleaned at the dentist every time I use it. You get a two week use before it needs to be charged again (just overnight) and the back is flat so if you set it down, it doesn&#x27;t roll. I like that it is a full sized brush head and really seems to get in between everything.</li>
    <li> To get the best out of this, use it when it&#x27;s fully charged</li>
    <li> just vibrates.bristles does not move side to side.does not hold much toothpaste.overall not a good buy. plus heads are hard to find and expensive.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to pay $100 more to get a toothbrush that has more features... This works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, I feel the the difference from my ordinary toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had one of these and just needed a new one. Works great!</li>
    <li> The brush is very small. You must keep your mouth closed when brushing too, you&#x27;ll spray all over the bathroom mirror. Went back to my old toothbrush. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Gift for wife who says she has that &amp;#34;dentist feel&amp;#34; after brushing.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> I would not want to brush my teeth manually after using this. Great at cleaning teeth, but be careful around the gum lines. Very basic with a push of a button and the rapid blinking light tells you when to charge it. It also auto shuts off in 2 mins. Would recommend to others and beats any deals out there so far.</li>
    <li> This is small enough so that it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my smallish counter. Works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife had been asking to get another sonic brush after she lost her last one.  This one was much better than the previous models.</li>
    <li> Philips sonicare toothbrushes that I used so far really good. This model works perfectly fine for me and is cheap compare to the new models of philips sonicare series.</li>
    <li> I went to the dentist recently and they reccomended this toothbrush to improve my gums.  I absolutely love it and I can feel the difference.  I love that it shuts off after two minutes becasue I have been guilty of not brushing for the whole two minutes.  Your whole mouth will feel so much cleaner and my teeth still feel like i just had a cleaning and my gums feel so much better.  The other electric toothbrushes you buy at the grocery store (like the oral b three pack) does not even compare.  It was well worth the 50 dollars and I will definitely be buying more Sonicare toothbrushes in the future!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit larger and heavier than my last sonic care but it will do the job until it is time for another, probably about 5 years :-)</li>
    <li> I had another Sonicare toothbrush that finally died on me so I bought this model as a replacement.  It does the job, but I miss the added features my other brush had like an adjustable speed setting and a pulse timer that signifies when it&#x27;s time to move to the other quadrant to brush.  This feature sounds a bit ridiculous but I really grew to like it and enjoyed that the brush would shut off on its own. For a basic brush, this still does the job.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter and she loves it.  She likes how it looks and it was not as expensive as the ones in CVS.</li>
    <li> This would not stay charged. Poorly made, no where near the quality of my original sonicare.</li>
    <li> I like the one that signals every 1/2 minute to go to another part of the mouth but this is a great product.</li>
    <li> It broke after 9 months of use.  This is the first Philips Sonicare toothbrush that&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
    <li> Good price and a good replacement for the charger works for a newer model although fit loosely.</li>
    <li> Loves it!!!!! Awesome toothbrush. Excellent buy will def buy again!</li>
    <li> Too bad the quad pacer is no longer available on this version, otherwise a fine quality product like Sonicare has always provided.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5 year old daughter because it was listed that it is good for kids.  She hates it because it only operates at a high speed and hurts her gums.  I wish this had a lower speed.</li>
    <li> A while ago my dentist recommended this tooth brush for me. Took me few month to buy because the price, if I knew how good it was I would have bought before.</li>
    <li> I love phillips sonicare so I new the product I&#x27;d be getting they are awesome toothbrushes and work great. :)</li>
    <li> What a deal! I can&#x27;t believe for under $40 I could get this awesome toothbrush. I really like the 2-minute timer that it has, so I always can be sure I&#x27;m not cheating my teeth out of any cleaning time ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told by my dentist to take it easy on my gums since they are already receding a bit from years of brushing too hard - he recommended a Sonicare toothbrush to help moderate my brushing. I don&#x27;t know if this is the exact model he himself uses, but I&#x27;m a fan. And I love that it comes in different colors (I got pink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge definitely lasts a while - about 1.5-2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves this!  Leaves the mouth feeling super clean and fresh!! Easy to clean and the brush heads are easy and cheap to come by.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is great.</li>
    <li> Not bad to use, but too much noise..</li>
    <li> Wow! Every time I brush my teeth with this toothbrush it feels like I just got it of the dentist&#x27;s office! My teeth feel super clean! I love that it has a charger! I used to have s cheap battery operated one and it doesn&#x27;t compare to this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s timed for 2 minutes but it doesn&#x27;t pause to let you know when to go to the next section/area like my old one did. I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> A perfect product to keep teeth clean.. Works good! Regular charging required but that is obvious...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve debated getting a nice electric toothbrush for a while, just didn&#x27;t know what to look for. I like this one because it has an auto shut off at 2 minutes - the time you&#x27;re supposed to brush, but never quite do. I like that its dumbed down for me so I don&#x27;t have to watch the clock. It felt a bit powerful the first few times I used it, but I got used to it and it seems just right now. Does a nice job, but I do still need to floss, which I thought it would help a little more with. I still love it. Its almost a year old and still working great.</li>
    <li> I had a sonicare when I was a kid. It was so awesome but after a few years it was pretty used so I threw it out. I decided to order one (as an adult) and didn&#x27;t realize they were so expensive. I went with this $50 version and bought one for my fiance and myself. I love it, and my mouth feels cleaner. I had a spot on my back tooth that has also grown smaller which I found interesting. My fiance said it hurt his mouth but that&#x27;s only because he needs to start flossing and is a baby about his mouth bleeding. That complaint was over a week ago though and so far I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative besides his mouth feeling better/cleaner. LOVE LOVE LOVE SONICARE!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush - it&#x27;s probably one of the cheaper high quality ones you can buy!  I don&#x27;t even have to leave it plugged in all the time, which is great for a couple days travel time.  The pinkish/fuschia and green versions are nice to look at as well.  I wish the heads weren&#x27;t so expensive, but they&#x27;re probably cheaper than others.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> So far, so good with the toothbrush.  It powerful, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Works great my teeth feel clean.</li>
    <li> cleans teeth great but where the head screws on the chamber fills up with water and cause mildew or mold to grow if you do not keep it cleaned out, definitely a pain in the neck and it says it has 30 sec intervals to tell you to change where you are brushing but it does not.</li>
    <li> works perfect. good price. like that it is a different color than my boyfriend&#x27;s</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like.  This is my 4th.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great! A cheaper version of the Elite model and just as good.</li>
    <li> My daughters teeth are much cleaner.</li>
    <li> LOVE! I&#x27;ve already recommended this toothbrush to a few friends and family member and we all love it! I honestly don&#x27;t like use a regular/manual toothbrush anymore because this electric toothbrush makes me feel like I went to the dentist every day/night! I read the reviews on the newer model, I see no difference other than the size being a little bigger than the newer model and the 30 seconds beeping, which I don&#x27;t care for. It comes with the recharging port. Charge last a long time for me and I brush for a long time each use. Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> NICE AND QUITE , FIT VERY GOOD IN HAND .  CLEANS UP QUICKLY, THANKS</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, battery lasts a long time with a full charge, and the travel case makes taking it with me easy!</li>
    <li> My 13 yo says she&#x27;s never had so much fun brushing her teeth.  WIN!</li>
    <li> I just got mine in the mail yesterday. I used it for the first time last night, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to a regular toothbrush!! Fantastic! Does tickle a little, but I am sure that will pass. My teeth feel clean, even without me pressing down the brush on my teeth and scrubbing. Fantastic toothbrush, even in this &amp;#34;basic model&amp;#34; as other reviews have stated, plus it comes with a 2 year warranty. They probably still sell the more basic models because, if it isn&#x27;t broke, why fit it?</li>
    <li> we use it and it was recommended by my dentist and periodontist. my cleanings are less painful.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. It cleans very well and holds charge for a good amount of time. I wish it had different settings on it but altogether nice product</li>
    <li> Once fully charged, it only lasts a week</li>
    <li> best buy ever for this product,</li>
</ol>
