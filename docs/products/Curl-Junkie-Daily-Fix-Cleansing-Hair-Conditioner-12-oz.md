### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is, as best I can describe it, sorta minty with some coconut-y.</li>
      <li>a side note, the company that ships this is superb.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using cleansing conditioners for about a year now, and this one is the best!</li>
      <li>I get the best of both worlds with this one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been working great!</li>
      <li>No Poo washing is the best!</li>
      <li>Seller is awesome as well.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product!!!!</li>
      <li>Then 2 days after that experience, I decided to try it and then follow up with the Beautiful Curls conditioner.</li>
      <li>They package the products beautifully and include an AVE YOU tote.</li>
      <li>I am a strict cowasher, and have been looking all over for a great cleansing conditioner that does not have silicones in it.  </li>
      <li>Great description.</li>
      <li>I went to naturallycurly.com and saw great reviews for this product for people with 3a or 3b hair.</li>
      <li>does a great job of conditioning and moisturizing my hair.</li>
      <li>Great Product.    </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great quality, or</li>
      <li>This one is now a great addition to my product rotation.</li>
      <li>This product has worked great to help me retain moisture in my two-strand twists.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Love!!</li>
      <li>Amazing customer service!</li>
      <li>Be kind to your curls!</li>
      <li>kind to your curls!</li>
      <li>And, it leaves my hair feeling really good.</li>
      <li>WORKS GOOD IN THE SUMMER</li>
      <li>It says that it is good for cleaning your hair and for lightweight moisture.</li>
      <li>Even after a full day of work and running around with my kids - my curls are still awesome and defined (and soft/shiny)!</li>
      <li>this works great even if I want to blow out and straighten my hair (which is most of the time).</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I am in love!</li>
      <li>Now my hair is amazing defined and non-frizzy.  </li>
      <li>This product was amazing...</li>
      <li>trick with any kind of conditioner cleaning is you can&#x27;t treat it like shampoo, because it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>but I liked it.</li>
      <li>as for people complaining about the smell, I liked it too.</li>
      <li>The light peppermint smell is very nice.</li>
      <li>This will be a great substitute when I want a clean refreshed feeling that adds moisture without stripping my 3c/ 4a hair strands.</li>
      <li>After using this product paired with just a normal curl shampoo and this as a conditioner I have the best head of hair I can remember having!</li>
      <li>liked the outcome of that method better.</li>
      <li>Product came sealed which is very important to me.</li>
      <li>As I Am products, which are touted as great for my type of hair on certain curly hair websites, were drying.</li>
      <li>Using the Cleansing Condition has made my hair noticeably softer and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>and my hair feel great and is very shiny.</li>
      <li>I should have read the description more closely.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>I have kinky curly type 4A hair with relaxed ends, and this stuff is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and use it to co-wash my hair.</li>
      <li>WHEN I CO-WASH MORE OFTEN.</li>
      <li>I have noticed, since using these products, that my hair looks healthier, feels more moisturized, and my curls are holding up better as my hair grows out</li>
      <li>the highlights are holding better too.</li>
      <li>More cleansing and conditioning that most cowashes.  </li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>and I had to use so much less...to get so much more out of my hair!!</li>
      <li>I have used many shampoos over the years for my fine curly hair</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much, but it&#x27;s still a good cleanser.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend for fine curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine, porous 4a hair and this cowash</li>
      <li>Enjoy...</li>
      <li>I was a confirmed WEN/fig cleansing conditioner user...</li>
      <li>i.e. Silicone free,sulfate free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick, creamy, evenly distributes through hair, cleanses nicely, conditions, and even smells really good!</li>
      <li>Was so excited for this too.</li>
      <li>Yes, pricy - but for me - worth it!</li>
      <li>It felt clean and supple.</li>
      <li>I clean, add some styler</li>
      <li>The smell is clean, and you have to scrub for like 1-3 minutes, but I would recommend for those looking to skip the shampoo.</li>
      <li>and, again, the price is right!  </li>
      <li>It cleanses completely, and moisturizes effectively.  </li>
      <li>Good product does what it says &amp; smells delicious but is too expensive... there is a nice cleansing conditioner i found at Sally&#x27;s for half the price!</li>
      <li>You have to spend more time scrubbing your scalp than you normally would, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And that is exactly what it is, which isn&#x27;t what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I have straight blond hair too and it is fine - have used for 2 weeks now</li>
      <li>My scalp and hair really felt clean....not shampoo clean but fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but unfortunately, not for my particular</li>
      <li>Too light weight, didn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>I love how soft my hair is.    </li>
      <li>If you are looking into &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;low poo&amp;#34; solutions, I would say this is worth your condsideration.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m debating whether it&#x27;s worth continuing with this product because of</li>
      <li>If you have dry hair and do the  Curly Girl method of \\&quot;conditioner washing\\&quot;--or co-washing--this is the best on the block for it right now, a new CJ product that&#x27;s getting raves in the natural hair/curl community--and has sold out on Curlmart.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re going to find right now.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It really leaves the scalp quite clean feeling and hair</li>
      <li>whether I should try something else that may be more economically efficient and deliver similar results.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had my eye on other cowashes that are also naturally derived and promise great results</li>
      <li>arrived fast!</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>And then my hair isn&#x27;t light and soft.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product for the first time in July 2010.  </li>
      <li>The first time I got this product, I just used this cleansing conditioner.</li>
      <li>All the gentle softness and moisture of a cowash, yet cleansing enough to remove most silicones, oils, butters or product.</li>
      <li>I really liked WEN but the price is just not worth it.  </li>
      <li>I used the WEN hair care system previously for about two months, which I liked as well,</li>
      <li>Not only does it work just as well as WEN, it has less residue, smells great</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>and then, on the seventh, using Curl Junkie&#x27;s gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather, so I had to get used to that, but I also know that a lot of shampoos add harmful chemicals for lathering, so this wasn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
      <li>When I used it, I really didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
      <li>However, I would prefer if the product could be purchased on-the-ground at, say, Whole Foods, for example.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far I like this as a cleansing agent in lieu of shampoo. I can&#x27;t say its done anything drastically different to my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all which I was afraid of. The smell is clean, and you have to scrub for like 1-3 minutes, but I would recommend for those looking to skip the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Worked well as long as you use it properly. Lots of scrubbing and add lots of water. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Good product does what it says &amp; smells delicious but is too expensive... there is a nice cleansing conditioner i found at Sally&#x27;s for half the price!</li>
    <li> It does everything as promised! My hair is cleaned and conditioned without having to use a sudsy cleanser or extra conditioner or leave in. Even with other CCs, this hasn&#x27;t happened before. I clean, add some styler and I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick with any kind of conditioner cleaning is you can&#x27;t treat it like shampoo, because it&#x27;s not. You have to spend more time scrubbing your scalp than you normally would, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually pondering long hair for the first time since childhood. That should say something!</li>
    <li> conditioning cleanser you&#x27;re going to find right now.  It&#x27;s a little expensive for me when you add up shipping charges.</li>
    <li> More cleansing and conditioning that most cowashes.  My scalp and hair really felt clean....not shampoo clean but fresh and clean. I&#x27;ve been through several bottles of this....not that expensive for me because I don&#x27;t cleanse daily. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I went to naturallycurly.com and saw great reviews for this product for people with 3a or 3b hair. It&#x27;s been working great! It doesn&#x27;t lather but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll miss it. I use it each time I wash except for once every week 1/2 I use a cleansing shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great Product.    I ordered the Curl Junkie Daily Fix Cleansing Conditioner , and have decided to never use shampoo again.    I love how soft my hair is.    It felt clean and supple.I would recomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used many shampoos over the years for my fine curly hair but I think I&#x27;ve finally found the one.  It cleanses gently without harsh soaps and has a built in conditioner which leaves my hair soft and smooth and reduces frizz.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for the first time in July 2010.  At the time, I was transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.  When I used it, I really didn&#x27;t like it.  So, I sold it on a hair forum product exchange board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months later, I underwent the Big Chop, and am now completely natural.  Regretting the fact that I sold what was practically a full bottle, I decided to repurchase Daily Fix again.  I am glad that I did.  It cleanses completely, and moisturizes effectively.  I like the idea of cleansing my hair several times a week without having to use shampoo - even sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not find the price of Daily Fix prohibitive.  However, I would prefer if the product could be purchased on-the-ground at, say, Whole Foods, for example.</li>
    <li> Purchased based on recommendation.  Daughter&#x27;s curls are less frizzy and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Now buying this in 32oz bottle.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking that it would be really moisturizing conditioner. I should have read the description more closely. It says that it is good for cleaning your hair and for lightweight moisture. And that is exactly what it is, which isn&#x27;t what I wanted! It works well to use as a sulfate and silicone-free moisturizing shampoo for people with curly hair. It shouldn&#x27;t be called a conditioner at all. Just a heads up that this is not as moisturizing as other conditioners. As for the smell, it is strange. It makes me think of a spearmint birthday cake, which is as weird as it sounds.</li>
    <li> I have noticed such a dramatic change since I started using the Curl Junkie line.  I&#x27;m a teacher and I am constantly bending down to help kids.  Normally, by the end of first period, my hair is tied back for the day because brushing it out of the way creates frizz.  Now, with this line of products, I&#x27;m able to keep my hair down all day without it looking like a frizzy mess.  My 7th grade girls have noticed too!  They have been complementing me since I started using this line.  I start with the Daily Fix, put Curls in a Bottle on before I dry it with an old t-shirt, and I finish up with a small amount of Smoothing Lotion.  This is totally worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> I have dry, itchy scalp issues and I can use this with no problem. The only issue or problem I&#x27;m having is that it takes a long time to wash out. I only use about a nickel or quarter size amount. Maybe I&#x27;m using too much, but it&#x27;s still a good cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a little over a month now - using this 6 days a week and then, on the seventh, using Curl Junkie&#x27;s gentle cleanser. I also use the smoothing conditioner. I have noticed, since using these products, that my hair looks healthier, feels more moisturized, and my curls are holding up better as my hair grows out (I have big, loopy &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; curls and when my hair grows, it weighs the curls down). If you are looking into &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;low poo&amp;#34; solutions, I would say this is worth your condsideration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used loads of &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; for my dry, fine, caucasian hair.  I really liked WEN but the price is just not worth it.  On a whim, I tried the Daily Fix.  Not only does it work just as well as WEN, it has less residue, smells great and, again, the price is right!  Fantastic product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have long (waist length) 2a hair (slight wave) that is fine,highly porous and severely damaged, so I try to use products that are as gentle as possible... i.e. Silicone free,sulfate free. I&#x27;ve been using cleansing conditioners for about a year now, and this one is the best! It&#x27;s thick, creamy, evenly distributes through hair, cleanses nicely, conditions, and even smells really good! No other CC has had all these benefits for me. I have an oily scalp prone to build up, and dry hair. This cleanser managed to tame the oil AND condition my hair like a deep conditioner! I am in love! Idc that its 25 a bottle. I&#x27;d pay twice that considering how soft my hair is right now, and I will be buying the bigger bottle next!</li>
    <li> I can only compare this product to As I Am&#x27;s Coconut Cowash and Cleansing Pudding Conditioners. I have thick 4a, 4b hair and it needs a lot of moisture. Curl Junkie&#x27;s cleansing conditioner is pricey but I find that my hair responds well to it. The As I Am products, which are touted as great for my type of hair on certain curly hair websites, were drying. This Curl Junkie product is a staple for me.</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting use to, but it has worked really well for me. The light peppermint smell is very nice. After applying, you are suppose to then wait a couple of minutes and then add some water to your head and create a little lather... I didn&#x27;t like that, so I apply and let it sit, and then I just rinse... liked the outcome of that method better.</li>
    <li> If you have dry hair and do the  Curly Girl method of \\&quot;conditioner washing\\&quot;--or co-washing--this is the best on the block for it right now, a new CJ product that&#x27;s getting raves in the natural hair/curl community--and has sold out on Curlmart. It cleans your scalp and hair with no stripping/harshness/drying. If you have normal hair, you may not need a rinse out conditioner. If you have dry hair, you will benefit from the gentle cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s glycerin/paraben/silicone/harsh-sulfate-FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a co-washer, you definitely want to try this. If you&#x27;re a modified CG-er, and you use Low Poo, you  may want to try this, too, to see if your hair benefits from an even gentler routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is, as best I can describe it, sorta minty with some coconut-y. It&#x27;s fresh and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there is a trick to using it, which is, essentially, starting with a quarter-sized or so puddle of the Daily Fix on VERY WATER-SATURATED HAIR and to keep the hair wet with continual adding of water (either by puddling water into palm and adding to hair or putting head under the shower spray for a split second). Then, as one should do when cowashing, spend a good few minutes massaging scalp with fingertips and raking, scrunching, emulsified Daily Fix into strands. LOTS OF WATER, and adding more Daily Fix in small increments as needed, and massage, massage, massage. You will know you&#x27;re using it properly, and with enough water, if you feel that change in the product in the hair that feels \\&quot;emulsified\\&quot; or \\&quot;sorta-sudsy\\&quot;, but not actual suds. Just that sorta-foamy, sorta-altered feeling that says it&#x27;s doing its job (imo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really leaves the scalp quite clean feeling and hair moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the list of ingredients, and the creator designates it as 97% naturally-derived ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG -7 Olivate, Guar Hydroxypropytrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Oat Flour, Mentha Piperita (Pepperment) Leaf Extract, Matricaria Recuitita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Yucca Leaf Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis (Melissa) Leaf Extract, Polysorbate 60, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail) Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be kind to your curls!

    <li> I ordered this product in a sample size and I&#x27;m totally sold after just using the sample up. I&#x27;ve ordered a bottle! I have always struggled with frizzy curls - I have to condition, moisturize and use 2 anti-frizz products just to control them for 12 hours (barely). And then my hair isn&#x27;t light and soft. After using this product paired with just a normal curl shampoo and this as a conditioner I have the best head of hair I can remember having! Even after a full day of work and running around with my kids - my curls are still awesome and defined (and soft/shiny)! I&#x27;m really glad I finally broke down and bought a bottle. Yes, pricy - but for me - worth it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realise what a difference using this product made until I had to use shampoo the other day for the first time in ages and my hair went instantly dry and frizzy again.  Using the Cleansing Condition has made my hair noticeably softer and more manageable.  You just need to massage it in for a minute or so until it turns into a thin foam, leave on for a couple of minutes while you&#x27;re cleaning the rest of your bod, then rinse very thoroughly! I count to a hundred in my head while I&#x27;m rinsing. Recommended product. Cheers, Hazel</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, brittle hair. I wear it naturally but struggle to retain moisture since I live in a very hot, dry climate. This product has worked great to help me retain moisture in my two-strand twists. I use it before I deep condition. You can use this as a conditioner or as a co-wash. And, it leaves my hair feeling really good. I would recommend it to anyone with natural or relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I really like it! I have straight blond hair too and it is fine - have used for 2 weeks now and my hair feel great and is very shiny. the highlights are holding better too. No Poo washing is the best!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and use it to co-wash my hair. I have 3b curly hair and this works great even if I want to blow out and straighten my hair (which is most of the time). I used the WEN hair care system previously for about two months, which I liked as well, however I felt it did not provide enough of a conditioning feels for my hair. With curl junkie I feel like my hair is more conditioned, which I need because I frequently blow dry and straighten my hair with a straightener. I love this conditioner! It helps to bring my hair back to life.</li>
    <li> Too light weight, didn&#x27;t do much at all. Was so excited for this too. I have fine, thin, curly hair and this actually made it straight... boo!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cleansing conditioner a couple of weeks ago, and have been using it ever since.  I have kinky curly type 4A hair with relaxed ends, and this stuff is fabulous!  I am a strict cowasher, and have been looking all over for a great cleansing conditioner that does not have silicones in it.  When I tried this, it immediately made my hair feel soft, and by working in a little water, it enhanced the cleaning effect of the conditioner.  After rinsing out the product, my hair was still soft, and their was no residue in it.  It did not feel sticky, hard, or oily (I had oil and moisturizers in it but no silicones of course). It was soft, which was what I wanted!! Love!!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t terrible, but for my curly hair, it isn&#x27;t good. The first time I got this product, I just used this cleansing conditioner. My hair didn&#x27;t seem bad, it was just REALLY dry and frizzy (which it is NOT that way when I use DevaCurl). As the day when on, my hair just wilted to a deflated mass of frizz. I am so disappointed because I really wanted this to work on my hair. Then 2 days after that experience, I decided to try it and then follow up with the Beautiful Curls conditioner. Same results. I wont be using the product again. I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but unfortunately, not for my particular curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the company that ships this is superb. They package the products beautifully and include an AVE YOU tote. Amazing customer service!</li>
    <li> WORKS GOOD IN THE SUMMER WHEN I CO-WASH MORE OFTEN. HAIR FELT CLEAN BUT NOT TOTALLY STRIPPED OF MOISTURE. ARRIVED ON TIME.</li>
    <li> Was too heavy for my hair.  Hair felt coated and weighed down.  Would not recommend for fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product... as for people complaining about the smell, I liked it too. Definitely odd, but I liked it. The review that said it was mint-y with a little coconut-y hit it right on the head. Great description. It doesn&#x27;t lather, so I had to get used to that, but I also know that a lot of shampoos add harmful chemicals for lathering, so this wasn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
    <li> Natural curls require a standard of care that exceeds those readily available. This is one that should be in any regimen for routine curly hair care.</li>
    <li> arrived fast! Can&#x27;t wait to use this product! This will be a great substitute when I want a clean refreshed feeling that adds moisture without stripping my 3c/ 4a hair strands.</li>
    <li> Left my hair a bit tangly and - oh my gosh - the smell is overpowering. Not worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  To me it is a cross between shampoo and cowashing. I get the best of both worlds with this one.  All the gentle softness and moisture of a cowash, yet cleansing enough to remove most silicones, oils, butters or product. This one is now a great addition to my product rotation. I use every few washes to remove any minor buildup and get hair looking and feeling nice.  .  Seller is awesome as well.  Product came sealed which is very important to me.</li>
    <li> I was a confirmed WEN/fig cleansing conditioner user...my dry frizzy hair did really well...that was until I tried Curl Junkie!  Now my hair is amazing defined and non-frizzy.  This product was amazing...and I had to use so much less...to get so much more out of my hair!!</li>
    <li> If you can afford buying this product about every 6 months then by all means go buy it. But for the average broke college student like myself, that&#x27;s pushing it a bit. I have fine, porous 4a hair and this cowash does a great job of conditioning and moisturizing my hair. I like to alternate between using shampoos and cowashing but I&#x27;ve had my eye on other cowashes that are also naturally derived and promise great results so I&#x27;m debating whether it&#x27;s worth continuing with this product because of it&#x27;s great quality, or whether I should try something else that may be more economically efficient and deliver similar results.</li>
