      <li>this get with the Aussie Freeze gel for more hold</li>
      <li>The label describes it as being an \\&quot;ultra hold\\&quot; gel, but for me it is more a light/moderate hold.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A must have for all curly girls.  Don&#x27;t forget to pick up the shampoo conditioner book and other products recommended for you curl type.  You will not be disappointed.  The only trick is to watch the video, go to a curlgirl salon, read curly girl, or go online to learn how to use the products.</li>
    <li> I really love this hair gel more than any other I have tried.  I have fairly curly hair normally, but this stuff makes it super curly every day w/o fail and never crunchy!  Plus it seems to be really gentle on my hair, probably due to having few harsh chemical ingredients.</li>
    <li> but this one is worth the money. makes it easier to have good looking air-dryed curls. better than what you get in the drugstore. cheaper online than in the salon</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Help your hair look good</li>
    <li> I have curly hair works great on my hair, I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> The Ultra Gel works great with no sticky or heavy weight feel and it makes my curls look awesome!</li>
    <li> I really like the Deva products.  I haven&#x27;t completely decided yet but I may like the light defining gel better than the ultra.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for Curly Hair Girls!</li>
    <li> Deva curl has amazing products been using them now for about 15 months I would never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner again  no frizz always have beautiful curly hair</li>
    <li> I have thin, wavy hair.. I actually thought my hair was pretty much straight my whole life. Then I came across some curly hair tutorials on youtube and decided to try to bring out my curl. I tried the Devacurl light defining gel first, and it wasn&#x27;t bad. But I could definitely use some more hold. Then I bought the Ultra defining gel, and this stuff is like pure magic! My hair length is about 4&amp;#34; below my shoulders and for this length I use 3 quarter sized puddles of gel in very wet hair. I put one puddle in dripping wet hair and scrunch. Then scrunch with micro-fiber towel, then 2 more puddles of gel.&lt;br /&gt;I diffuse until about 70% dry, and then let it air dry. When it is totally dry, I put my head upside down and scrunch out the crunch. Then fluff from the roots to break up the curl and it looks amazing and holds all day!!!&lt;br /&gt;At night, I spray with water with a dash of gel and make a pineapple on top of my head. Next morning, I refresh with some more water/gel, and it looks even better than the first day. Sometimes, I can get it to hold for 3 days! Amazing! My friends think I have had a perm...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time. And, I have liked it for a long time. Recently I bought a wig because my hair is thinning very badly and my curls are just not the curls they used to be. I still wash with No-Poo,and conditioning with One Condition, but I have been leaving out this gel. Drying it I have not been caring/careful to maintain the curls. TO MY SURPRISE, my hair feels softer and the curls are fuller. Still thinning, but I like my hair better without this gel.</li>
    <li> Works best with the Diva Curl One Condition and a no poo or low poo shampoo.  Can get a little stiff without the right combination of conditioners beforehand.</li>
    <li> Love it. Light but stillholds the curls very well. Doesnt leave the hair crunchy. Ill be buying it again.  I love all the devacurl products!</li>
    <li> Worked Ok recently ran out so had to buy from Salon and it was a lot thicker. May be watered down.</li>
    <li> works well with my curly hair. only need a little amount. love the pump option.</li>
    <li> Doesnt dry out my hair, not too stiff</li>
    <li> great product line - my hair just loves it&lt;br /&gt;washes great, smells great, my husband loves my hair&lt;br /&gt;daily use is perfectly fine</li>
    <li> Love this product. Love how my hair looks after I put the product in. My curls look beautiful and defined. People have stopped me in the street to ask me what I use in my hair. I am African American with curly hair. This product works great for my hair. Hope it works well for you.</li>
    <li> This helps keepy curls in all day long. Just run it through your curls and they are beautiful all day long.</li>
    <li> This has great frizz free hold for my naturally curly hair. Let it dry, scrunch out the crunch and it&#x27;s done.  It&#x27;s definitely one of my HG products. I use a lot of the deva products and am mostly cg.</li>
    <li> This has very little defining capability for thick curly hair.  It leaves my hair poufy - not a good thing.</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp;#34;curl definer&amp;#34; that has worked perfectly with my hair (I have 4a-4b dense hair) this couples well with holding gel of your choice. It seems like this line goes well with my hair and I would also like to try the leave in once more. see how it works with defining gel.</li>
    <li> This product is OK. Makes the curls somewhat better looking, but makes the hair look dull. When I use this product I would add some shine afterwards and then my hair looks good. It is also important what amount  you use; have to experiment with it a little, as it is easy to use more than needed. It does not make your hair sticky, feels good when applying. I expected more of it, but I still will use it.</li>
    <li> This product defines your curls without being heavy or sticky.  After going to the Devachan Salon and learning how to use their products, I am getting awesome results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in the shower, after cleansing and conditioning with DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition, bend at the waist and apply a generous amount of Ultra Defining Gel to soaking wet hair (don&#x27;t squeeze out water after rinsing out conditioner), by coating product gently over the bottom, top and each side of hair.  (You do not need to apply it throughout your hair but only as an outer shell.) Then grab the ends and begin squeezing upward, scrunching the hair and squeezing out the excess water.  You can then take a microfiber towel and continue to scrunch as you remove more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand up straight and &amp;#34;don&#x27;t touch&amp;#34; your curls again until they are dry.  You can put some clips on small sections on top to allow the hair to dry with some height.  Then, after hair is dry, you can slide your fingers under the top layers of hair and hand scrub your scalp to loosen up the curls and then scrunch again the outer curls to break up the cast from the gel.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at the results!!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a must buy item. I have long hair that is not consistent, some pieces are straight, some are wavy and then underneath I have curls. My salon suggested it because I have wavy hair and VERY dry and gets frizzy. This tames your curls, no frizz. The best thing is it leaves no stickiness in your hair and it does not dry hard. if it dries hard you just fluff it up and your good to go. Looks very natural and NO harmful stuff in it. The last and final plus is it smells great. Its also cheaper here on amazon then if I walk into my salon, even after shipping. Buy it and you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;Heather from RI</li>
    <li> The ultra defining gel works well with my hair.</li>
    <li> I have started using DevaCurl and am a convert! I recommend the products to everyone and after getting my hair cut by a specialist, there is no turning back. The DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel is great!</li>
    <li> I have used many hair products over the past year or so of doing the CG method and this is by far the worst one I have used. My 3 dollar emergency tubs of random products from rite aid did more for me than this. It left my hair dry and sticky and didnt even hold a curl.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair, and this gel has enough hold to keep my curls bouncy and fresh all day (even the next day). The gel dries hard, but once I scrunch it with my hand it becomes soft.  I love the No-Poo and One Condition by Devacurl as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Definition for days with none of the weight. Literally, finish with a little coconut oil and you don&#x27;t need to do your hair again for about a week. Walking outside in the South Florida heat, going to the beach (without getting hair wet, of course) &amp; I&#x27;m still good to go. Smells awesome too. I do wish the ingredients were a bit more natural or even a touch organic, but SheaMoisture is sooo expensive! This is nearly half the cost per oz and at least its free of those silly-cones and parabens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel for about a year now. It has a great hold in my hair, and my curls look amazing for days. I also like this gel because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all crunchy...it softens up the more you touch it. It might be a bit more expensive than other gels out there, but I&#x27;m going to stick with it because it&#x27;s working for my hair.</li>
    <li> This works well on s&#x27;wavy hair.  It separates, defines and holds the waves in place.  It&#x27;s a bit crunchy and wet looking, but if you use it on dripping wet hair, then scrunch your hair once it&#x27;s completely dry, it softens up.  I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> After trying almost every product on the market to get non-frizz, no crunch curls (including several in combinations), I was thrilled to find Devacurl!  Even on the high humidity days in Houston, this stuff works.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit expensive and I use quite a bit on my long hair, but I can now clean out the bathroom closet and toss all the tens of bottles of other stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t get much easier than getting out of the shower, wrapping up the hair in a microfiber towel for 5 minutes and applying this gel.  Let it dry, then mess it about a bit and you get perfect curls. Plus, it&#x27;s all natural!  Yay, Devacurl!!!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!!! I have very thick, curly hair and it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a curly girl Deva convert and good prices and good delivery made this a winner.</li>
    <li> I love the size of this thing!  And how it comes out is great.  I have very thick, coarse hair, and I don&#x27;t have time in my morning to sit there and squirt these little tiny pumps of stuff 85 times.  It actually comes out with enough the first couple times. As for how well it works - it does the job. I would get it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s great for curly hair. Just don&#x27;t use too much...try to apply from the bottom/back of the hair and work upwards.  Defines curls and helps control frizz.</li>
    <li> love it for my curls......</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I read so many great reviews and was excited to try it. From day one it weighed my hair down and made it sticky and brittle feeling. I then tried to use just a little bit but it did the same thing. It did not enhance my curls but instead made them heavy and oily. My hair is more fine and naturally softer but I&#x27;ve never found most curl products to weigh my curls down, especially as badly as this product did.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product! My hair has never looked as good. My curls are soft and tighter than ever before! Not to mention it lasts all day without getting frizzy, I haven&#x27;t used a hair tie in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the conditioner every day like shampoo, making sure to scrub my scalp and really work it into the ends. I then rinse, but not completely. I use the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; once a week. I use the gel when my hair is sopping wet and then again after it has hair dried a bit, just to make sure the ends are covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to another product. Nor will I ever have to waste money again for products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Not a heavy gel, I dry my hair upside down with a diffuser, the stiffness that I experienced in other products is not there.  I still get the defined curl I want but  my hair moves.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, the price and the quick shipping.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised but it appeared to be a couple of ounces low in the container when it arrived. I do love Diva Hair Products!</li>
    <li> Good service.Good products.</li>
    <li> Best for curls and amazing smell, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this gel.  Follow the directions in the Curly Girl handbook for use and you will have soft beautiful curls.  I love this large size for my shower and I bought the smaller size for travel.</li>
    <li> The conditioner was a much thinner consistency. I believe it was watered down.</li>
    <li> Love this gel and the price is way better than at the salon! Thank you</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly / frizzy hair and this gel works perfectly to get it under control. After is dries, it looks really crunchy but I scrunch it out and it turns into perfect soft curls. I mostly follow the &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; technique and use the Devacurl &amp;#34;No Poo&amp;#34; with this conditioner. I layer this get with the Aussie Freeze gel for more hold but the Aussie gel can cause white flakes. Combining the two seems to work perfectly for me, at least for now.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair gel for curly hair types.  The label describes it as being an \\&quot;ultra hold\\&quot; gel, but for me it is more a light/moderate hold.  It is not sticky or heavy and does not make my hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or stiff or look like plastic.  It has a pleasant, mild fragrance which I find slightly fresh and slightly fruity...do I detect peaches?  Not sure, very subtle.  Does not compete with my perfumes.  The pump top of the 32 oz. size is very convenient and I plan to purchase this size with pump top from now on.  This is the best hair gel I have found.  Sometimes I wish it had a little more hold.  For instance, I never have to scrunch my ends once dry to soften the hold as one usually does with curly gelled hair.  And some of my top curlier locks can look a little frizzy sometimes.  But I have very long 3a/3b hair (below bra strap, long layers) and live in Florida where it is usually very hot and humid, so maybe I am expecting too much.  I would absolutely recommend this hair gel.</li>
    <li> So Deva Curl products are amazing in my book. I use this on my type 3c hair. I have lots of spirals mixed with some waves, hair that frizzes easily, and it appears thick but is actually not. I use this exactly as instructed. Apply after shower using a head upside down, scrunching motion. Wrap in a microfiber towel. Allow to dry in the towel about 30 minutes and then air dry a little followed by a diffuser. While I&#x27;m diffusing I shake off the cast! The cruncy stiff feeling is gone and I&#x27;m left with soft spirals. I also use a small amount of non foaming mousse before wrapping in the towel. And after diffusing I&#x27;ll use a light anti frizz cream. But this gel is the key for me!</li>
    <li> This Deva Curl product works very well because it really holds the shape of my curls without stiffness. I was introduced to Devacurl products at salon I went to recently and I went home and purchased this right away!  The big bottle will last a long time because I only use 2 pumps each morning. I have purchased quite a few (read:HUNDREDS) of hair products in my lifetime and this one really hits the mark. It makes soft loose curls and no crunchiness to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have searched for many years for the right products; some were made my hair stiff, some dryed it out, some didn&#x27;t help with frizz, some made my hair flakey, some itchy...... this product is great! After carefully researching I found it reassuring to know that the lady, Lorraine Massey, who invented this line of products ACTUALLY HAS NATURALLY CURLY HAIR HERSELF!!! I purchased the deva curl gel, deva curl no poo, deva curl conditioner, and curly girl book - my experience with all of them together is fantastic! I am not kidding...ONE wash and gel using the method detailed for my hair in the book and it was a night and day difference!!! ONE wash and people I see every day were commenting on how great my hair looked literally overnight!! I only wish I could get to the Devachan salon to have a cut done by someone who actually knows how to cut curly hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hats off to the Deva Girls from all of us curly girls!!! :)</li>
    <li> I have blonde naturally curly hair and over the years my spirals aren&#x27;t as firm. So I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help to create and hold curls. This product is so sticky that I don&#x27;t get curls, I get dry looking crunchy hair. This product is very disappointing. I will go back to Ouidad products.</li>
    <li> First off, I should say that this gel is amazing and a curly-haired person&#x27;s savior. You need to apply it carefully to wet hair, so here&#x27;s my process.    1) Rinse out your conditioner upside down in the shower. Keep yourself that way through Steps 1 - 4 .  2) Turn off shower. Add in a little conditioner if you need to, although I never do. Do NOT rake through hair, just gently pat some onto your ends. Let hair drip a bit while you towel off, still upside down.  3) Apply gel by gliding it over your hair. I work from my neck down to my ends, trying to gently glide some over individual pieces, roots to ends. I also put some along my pointer fingers and gently swipe some in near my roots where I&#x27;d wear a headband and near the back crown of my head. Then I cover my palms and fingers in gel and scrunch my hair to strain out water finally. Stop as soon as you stop getting significant amounts of water out, and try to accomplish this in as few scrunches as possible.  4) Grab an old t-shirt or Devacurl microfiber towel and scrunch hair super carefully in sections to dry it. I hold a section in a scrunch until I can feel water coming through the towel, then move on. You want to touch your hair as little as possible. I do each section 2 times.  5) Flip over and apply clips at roots if you need more volume while drying.    EDIT: As soon as you get your hair dried, make sure to scrunch it out carefully! Otherwise hair will be crispy and weird. Getting it super crispy is important in protecting your hair while it dries though.    The upside down bit can be avoided if you get good volume up top, but my hair gets weighed down by water easily so I stay upside down until it&#x27;s lighter. My hair would also clump into one giant curl if I let it, so keeping upside down lets it break up a bit more. I think this product smells nice, provides a good long hold on your curls, and isn&#x27;t drying compared to a lot of gels. If you find it to be drying, re-examine your conditioning process.    Why amI giving a 2 out of 5 when this product deserves a 5? This seller sent me a bottle with a majorly cracked pump, which probably did NOT happen through shipping because it was well-packed. My old pump also doesn&#x27;t work as a replacement despite my best efforts, so I&#x27;m having to carefully pour it out of the bottle. Not happy about that, having a pump on a bottle of this size is necessary, especially when upside down with wet, gel-y hands.</li>
    <li> Firm hold for my curls!</li>
    <li> I love what this does for my curls.  I use it throughout my hair (not just on my ends as some curly girl websites would advise you to do) and it works amazing.  My curls are soft and stand up to the toughest humidity!</li>
    <li> works like a charm and I used to hate gel cause it was too sticky.This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> I love DevaCurl. This gel is awesome and doesn&#x27;t dry sticky or hard. My curls look great all day and feel great.</li>
    <li> I have s&#x27;wavy hair and was using the light gel.  The light gel was great, but I would loose hold by the end of the day and end up with frizz.  I switched to this and it&#x27;s great.  I don&#x27;t have to use as much as the light to achieve the desired look, which is great!  I use all the Deva Curl line on my hair, and it&#x27;s the best stuff out there.</li>
    <li> Stinks so bad it gives me a headache and makes my hair feel like straw even after I wash it</li>
    <li> Super, because it is truly, ultra, defining, curl gel!</li>
    <li> Love DEVA, but this is not the greatest hold. You have to put A LOT of gel on your hair and even then, if it is humid out, you are on your own.</li>
