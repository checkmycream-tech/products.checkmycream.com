      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I bought this with the Gogoonly Nail Art Stamp Plate Collection St. Happy - Huge Size Stamping Image Plates Manicure Nail Designs DIY-BH000461.</li>
      <li>With a silicone and a rubber option, this is a nice starter set of stampers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Picks up image nicely after priming.</li>
      <li>Nice stamper.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and the ones I received needed no priming what so ever .</li>
      <li>I found that an old credit card works the best when scraping the templates.  </li>
      <li>Works wayyy better then the expencive one my mom got me.</li>
      <li>They work better (deducted a star for the scraper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Stamp is ok, the scraper does not work well at all</li>
      <li>Now i can put stamps on my nails :)</li>
      <li>There are better plastic stampers on Amazon.</li>
      <li>For me, the one with the &amp;#34;double&amp;#34; edge is the better side to scrape with.)</li>
      <li>I just recommend YOUTUBE to find some good examples of stamping success using these stampers, and the versatility of them.</li>
      <li>(Make sure that you check which side you&#x27;re using.</li>
      <li>The stampers are okay, Although they too are made of plastic as well as silicone and rubber.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love these stampers&lt;br</li>
      <li>, wish the spreader worked better though.</li>
      <li>The stampers are great but the scrapers aren&#x27;t so I highly recommend just buying a set of two stampers</li>
      <li>Loved it, works very well!</li>
      <li>This method will NOT damage the it, it is a VERY FAST clean, keeps the stamper in a great usable condition, maintains the surface for optimal stamping pickup and transfer success, and is just too cost effective and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely clean before using!</li>
      <li>good product i like the way it is shaped covers the whole nail</li>
      <li>Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
      <li>It was able to pick up any design without any smudge and it is an easy clean up.</li>
      <li>The silicone is a nice large area</li>
      <li>Great stamper, it is nice that they are raised a little to ensure the stamp doesnt smear.</li>
      <li>Looks cheap.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll find the stamper will be more prone to success if you prep the surface</li>
      <li>As well, the scapers are kind of a bust - using a business card or old plastic gift card works better.  </li>
      <li>I did have to run a nail file across the scraper to file away a few imperfections, but they worked beautifully after that. :)</li>
      <li>so I am able to roll it over my nail easily - covering the whole nail with the stamping design.</li>
      <li>These are the first square stampers I have purchased and I love them .</li>
      <li>the BEST way to clean these is after EVERY stamp, SOLIDLY and completely press the surface onto a sticky tape style lint roller, you can use a rocking motion to get all the surface contact with the sticky lint roller.  </li>
      <li>Use a lint roller or tape to clean off excess</li>
      <li>Really like it, great when stamping with white</li>
      <li>The green stamper works great.  </li>
      <li>The texture is nice, having the two colour options allows a choice to ensure you can see different coloured paints.</li>
      <li>Gently buff the surface with a nail BUFFER (not a file) and rinse in clean water.  </li>
      <li>Got them very fast.</li>
      <li>I find having a little variety is good.  </li>
      <li>Thanks again!</li>
      <li>pics was of my Asian inspired nail stamps on top of my home gel nail manicure, using the BMC stamper for the first time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They work right out of the package,thanks so much</li>
      <li>I was really expecting something a little bigger, but these work great</li>
      <li>No matter how much priming I do, it won&#x27;t pick up.</li>
      <li>This stamp works really well.</li>
      <li>The scrapers did not work very well</li>
      <li>I do really like these stampers.</li>
      <li>I really like the plastic scraper</li>
      <li>One way works better than the other.</li>
      <li>I received these stampers and I love them, because when you picking up white paint you can&#x27;t see it with a white stamper,  so you need another color,</li>
      <li>I do like how this has more area coverage than the one I was using (a cheap brand that was only small, circular shape).</li>
      <li>but if you still want the whole set or if you already bought it just is an old gift card or credit card</li>
      <li>well I ended up using an old card and the stamper doesn&#x27;t cover the whole nail</li>
      <li>I just use these for single image stamps and not for full nail images.</li>
      <li>Now I need new disc to try new patterns.</li>
      <li>Came Faster Then Expected , It Is Small But Amazingly Good</li>
      <li>I use an old store discount card, credit card type of scraper.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Purchased directly from Bundle Monster.</li>
      <li>However, the white one doesn&#x27;t transfer very well.  </li>
      <li>Instead I use an old credit card.</li>
      <li>but I use an old credit card.</li>
      <li>As for the scrapers, I just don&#x27;t use them because I prefer to use an old prescription card to swipe away the excess polish.  </li>
      <li>Wow, these do not work at all.</li>
      <li>I love that one is white for darker polishes and one is green for lighter polishes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Item was as described &amp; came in time.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work out for me. Looks cheap.</li>
    <li> The texture is nice, having the two colour options allows a choice to ensure you can see different coloured paints. Only complaint is that the pad is just large enough to cover my thumb nails, so there is no room error.</li>
    <li> These are the first square stampers I have purchased and I love them . Very easy to use and the ones I received needed no priming what so ever .</li>
    <li> Great 2 stamps for the money. The scrapers did not work very well but I use an old credit card. I found that an old credit card works the best when scraping the templates.  Great product.  Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> Works great had no problems it picks up the design well 😉</li>
    <li> still working with it</li>
    <li> Stampa work really good, wish the spreader worked better though. Very happy, nice packaging too 😍😍</li>
    <li> Thank you. Now i can put stamps on my nails :)</li>
    <li> These DO take a little practice, have fun with it while you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PREP your stamper!  Gently buff the surface with a nail BUFFER (not a file) and rinse in clean water.  You&#x27;ll find the stamper will be more prone to success if you prep the surface first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!  All stampers in different materials, shapes and degree of firmness have good and bad points.  I find having a little variety is good.  These have a good wide/narrow areas to cover whatever you need well.  I just recommend YOUTUBE to find some good examples of stamping success using these stampers, and the versatility of them. Like using your stamper to make a nail art &amp;#34;transfer&amp;#34; layer... Just play and practice!  With a silicone and a rubber option, this is a nice starter set of stampers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrapper that comes with these are only SOSO.. I don&#x27;t use it.  I use an old store discount card, credit card type of scraper.  They work better (deducted a star for the scraper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.. read the reviews, but at this price point, honey, just learn the ins and outs of stamping and play with these.  I get great stamps from these, you just need to practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER: do NOT clean your stamper with acetone or nail polish remover, the BEST way to clean these is after EVERY stamp, SOLIDLY and completely press the surface onto a sticky tape style lint roller, you can use a rocking motion to get all the surface contact with the sticky lint roller.  This method will NOT damage the it, it is a VERY FAST clean, keeps the stamper in a great usable condition, maintains the surface for optimal stamping pickup and transfer success, and is just too cost effective and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.....  pics was of my Asian inspired nail stamps on top of my home gel nail manicure, using the BMC stamper for the first time.</li>
    <li> excelente 100% recomendable</li>
    <li> Came Faster Then Expected , It Is Small But Amazingly Good</li>
    <li> Wont pick up any color. Terrible.</li>
    <li> The plastic scraper works great...the stampers, not so well.[[ASIN:B00NPF6GMI BMC 4pc Silicone and Rubber Stamper Plastic Scraper Nail Art Manicure Stamping Tools Set]]</li>
    <li> Great material, i tried it yesterday and it worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> It takes a bit to get used to the rectangular stamper as I&#x27;m used to a circular one.  As well, the scapers are kind of a bust - using a business card or old plastic gift card works better.  Definitely clean before using!</li>
    <li> This stamper is amazing! I had this one stamper that was crap and didn&#x27;t work so I was kinda iffy on buying one, I chose this one. It arrived at the right time, I didn&#x27;t have to do any priming and it worked perfectly, for the price and how it works, it was money well spent☺️</li>
    <li> I like the plastic scrappers because they don&#x27;t scratch my plates. I wanted rectangular bigger stampers because I purchased the XL plates drom Bundle Monster, but they are too hard, I can&#x27;t catch the polish well, and not really larger than my others round regular stampers, which I end up using.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that it did not work or that the polish I was using, were not good, until I discovered that I just had to file out a little bit the green stamping in order to get more pore and make the paint stick on it. Once I have done, now works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I just received these today. I did some stamping on paper, and these stamps worked perfectly. They seem very small. I was really expecting something a little bigger, but these work great so I&#x27;m happy 😊 The white one is silicone and not squishy. The green one is rubber and really hard. Both worked great for me when picking up images.</li>
    <li> I really like the plastic scraper</li>
    <li> Plastic mostly, I do not use the scrapers anymore because they scratch my plates and they do not cover a very large area..Instead I use an old credit card. The stampers are okay, Although they too are made of plastic as well as silicone and rubber. The only issues I have with the stampers are that the silicone part comes out, nothing is there to hold it into place. I bought these thinking they would be attached at least. The silicone is a nice large area so I am able to roll it over my nail easily - covering the whole nail with the stamping design. The stampers have trouble picking up the polish, even when I am using stamping polish - disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just as described, love it!</li>
    <li> I do really like these stampers. I only wish they were a tiny bit bigger. I prefer the rubber over the silicone but they both have their uses.</li>
    <li> Nice stamper. They do not have a lot of give, they are pretty firm and do not really mold to nail to transfer design. I just use these for single image stamps and not for full nail images.</li>
    <li> Really like it, great when stamping with white</li>
    <li> I received these stampers and I love them, because when you picking up white paint you can&#x27;t see it with a white stamper,  so you need another color, that why these to stampers are perfect. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> These square stampers are perfect for keeping a crisp diagonal line across your manicures. They&#x27;re not squishy but firm and do require a little priming to use the first time (file a little, rub with a little acetone, clean). The gripper is the perfect size to maneuver across my nails. I love that one is white for darker polishes and one is green for lighter polishes. Don&#x27;t use acetone on them after priming. Use a lint roller or tape to clean off excess polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrapers work great too! (Make sure that you check which side you&#x27;re using. One way works better than the other. For me, the one with the &amp;#34;double&amp;#34; edge is the better side to scrape with.) I did have to run a nail file across the scraper to file away a few imperfections, but they worked beautifully after that. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased directly from Bundle Monster.</li>
    <li> I just received it today, good delivery time. They look like they will work well and the scrapers look good for plastic, I just thought they would be bigger, they don&#x27;t even cover my thumb.  :(</li>
    <li> Looooveee it! It was able to pick up any design without any smudge and it is an easy clean up.</li>
    <li> Great stamper, it is nice that they are raised a little to ensure the stamp doesnt smear. I bought this with the Gogoonly Nail Art Stamp Plate Collection St. Happy - Huge Size Stamping Image Plates Manicure Nail Designs DIY-BH000461.</li>
    <li> The stampers are great but the scrapers aren&#x27;t so I highly recommend just buying a set of two stampers but if you still want the whole set or if you already bought it just is an old gift card or credit card</li>
    <li> Stamp is ok, the scraper does not work well at all</li>
    <li> good product i like the way it is shaped covers the whole nail</li>
    <li> No matter how much priming I do, it won&#x27;t pick up. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Delivery and packaging is great. I received it just as expected. The product is not ideal for nail stamping. On the other hand you can use it for stamping decal. Both rubber parts are too hard and does not flow the shape of your nails.</li>
    <li> not very good at pickiungup stamp</li>
    <li> these stamper work great</li>
    <li> Picks up image nicely after priming.</li>
    <li> Wow, these do not work at all. The stampers are too stiff and small to pick up the whole image from many of my plates, and the scraper is UNEVEN. Don&#x27;t waste your money. There are better plastic stampers on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Stamper&#x27;s were shipped in a timely manner,  however the scraper doesn&#x27;t work well I ended up using an old card and the stamper doesn&#x27;t cover the whole nail so I will be on the look out for a bigger stamper.</li>
    <li> This stamper kit has been a great gift. The little stampers are much easier for me to use on my smaller nails and the green stamper is genius to used with white polish so you can actually see the print. Great combination.</li>
    <li> Good company good product s!!</li>
    <li> The white stamper doesn&#x27;t work in the swiped is uneven. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Work great for me and I&#x27;m a beginner! I purchased two packs!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works wayyy better then the expencive one my mom got me.</li>
    <li> Loved it, works very well!</li>
    <li> Delivery and stamp size was and is perfect. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Took some getting used to, but I eventually got the hang of it. I do like how this has more area coverage than the one I was using (a cheap brand that was only small, circular shape).</li>
    <li> No no no! I buy 7 and I lost my money. Dont liked are all !!</li>
    <li> My Daughter Sarah is Nail Crazed and loves these nail stamps</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these stampers&lt;br /&gt;They work right out of the package,thanks so much</li>
    <li> Work great and a good price. Got them very fast.</li>
    <li> Nail art design would not stick to the silicone or rubber! I&#x27;m thinking I might have to buff them first, although other customers stated that there was no need to buff.</li>
    <li> It takes some practice,  in time it dose get easier. Now I need new disc to try new patterns.</li>
    <li> it cane on time the rubber doesn&#x27;t peel and it is great with any stamping plate</li>
    <li> This stamp works really well. I&#x27;ve bought others that are terrible and this one works great!</li>
    <li> The green stamper works great.  However, the white one doesn&#x27;t transfer very well.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews stating some stampers need to be primed. I will try priming it and are if it works.  As for the scrapers, I just don&#x27;t use them because I prefer to use an old prescription card to swipe away the excess polish.  It&#x27;s just my personal preference and had nothing to do with the scrapers that came with the stampers.</li>
