      <li>It was just a little more harsh than I wanted for that day, so I went with something else, but I wore it to all the events the week before the wedding leading up to the big day.  </li>

    <li> I love this perfume.  I bought it without ever having smelled it with the intention of wearing it on my wedding day.  It was just a little more harsh than I wanted for that day, so I went with something else, but I wore it to all the events the week before the wedding leading up to the big day.  Now whenever I smell it, I am reminded of all the fun things going on during that week and how excited and happy I was.</li>

    <li> I like to use it everyday, it,s good for daly use, good for evening use too, it&#x27;s good quality number one to use!!!</li>
    <li> bought this to be worn on my wedding day. Love the name as it suits how I felt at the time. Now each time I wear it, I&#x27;m reminded of how I felt on the day we got married - excited, happy, nervous, elated. Love how the smell is not too flowery or too strong. It lasts all day long too.</li>

As soon as I smelled this after my friend wore it I knew it was the perfect one. The packaging is amazingly elegant and very pretty.  I recommend this for older teens to even mid 20s. It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent.</li>
