    <li> First time using this product, really like it.  It does thicken my fine hair, does not weigh it down, and smells great!</li>
    <li> This beats Redkins&#x27; foam thickener by a mile!  Does not leave any &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; filmy feeling at all and leaves hair full and shiny.  My graying hair is fine and needs shampooing just about every day to maintain body.  With this spray, I can squeeze in even an extra TWO days and not feel grimy.  Its lemony fragrance disappears in minutes, which is ideal to this fragrance-sensitive person.  A terrific product!</li>
    <li> Hello nice smelling thickening spray. I love it get it! Smells nice, no bad texture, good thickness and volume when spray at my roots.</li>
    <li> I use the Lemon Sage shampoo and conditioner and purchased this to compliment and it works great. My girlfriend uses a different product but she has used this a couple times and likes it too.</li>
    <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive for such a small amount because it really does work.  I want to get more but we shall see if I can find something else where you get more for your money...</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It thickens my hair without making it feel weighted down.</li>
    <li> Although this product may not thicken my hair much, at least not that I can tell, it allows me to style my hair with a dry look which is hard to do with most hair products.</li>
    <li> Do not feel it worked</li>
    <li> Super product--love my full hair, not weighed down, as with many other products!</li>
    <li> My wife said that it is drying to her hair.</li>
    <li> I just spray on damp hair and blow dry.  My hair has been thinning out around crown area. It really gives my hair a lift. It helps to conceal the area bc of the volume and thickness it provides.  I highly recommend to anyone who had the same problem,  or even if you just like the extra volume.</li>
    <li> easy to use---does its job!</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to this line of products.  If you have sensitive skin, you may want to shy away from this line.  They smell really nice so it was a shame that I had a reaction. :(</li>
    <li> Using it every day! Works great for natural curls/waves. Using much less hairspray for volume</li>
    <li> Have used a few times, seems to work well &amp; conditions hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> Does very well with my hair</li>
    <li> Watered down. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This works so well! I wish I had found this sooner!</li>
    <li> Works great on fine hair.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks, and my hair definitely looks less flat at the top.</li>
    <li> Really works! I was skeptical. I have very fine hair. I have used several different products over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I find something then they stop making it. So now I have been looking and trying several different thickening, plumping hair products for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well , I finally found this. I was glad they sell it in the smaller bottle so I could just spend a few dollars to see if I like it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I love it. I am so happy I found it.  I just hope they do not discontinue this one day.  And my hair does not feel sticky, or sprayed. I spray on wet hair and surprisingly makes my hair tangle free. Then I blow it dry. After that I use my curling iron and then put on a finishing spritz. Lasts all day. Looks full and great!. Very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a dirt cheap add on item. I have long, fine, straight hair. This spray just makes it flat and a little greasy looking. I even paired it with the Lemon Sage shampoo, with the same results. Doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. The only reason I don&#x27;t care is it was less than a dollar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year, and it does a great job.  What I really love is the scent.</li>
    <li> This replaces the L&#x27;oreal Vive Pro Glossy Color Vive Conditioning Spray I&#x27;ve been using for some time now. I have made a decision to stop supporting companies that persist in animal testing___ a list that includes L&#x27;oreal and a lot of main stream brands. Paul Mitchell is one of the best known, cruelty free companies around, so that&#x27;s where I started my search for alternative products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ll need to go any further. This Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Spray gives me the same shine and manageability of the Vive product, more volume w less product and a crisp, clean fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  It&#x27;s proven to be the perfect compliment to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Lemon and Sage volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Affordable, Effective, Cruelty Free and Free shipping__what&#x27;s not to love ?</li>
    <li> Love this product, it really works!!!</li>
    <li> love this product and smells SO good!</li>
    <li> Really like this spray. Keeps my style holding strong better than many other more expensive sprays, although it does cost more than it should. My hair does look thicker after blow-drying, so it seems to work. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect Size for anyone that travels! The thickening spray adds just enough volume. I spray it in my hair just before blow drying and it helps hold my hair in place.  For added volume simply spray more near the roots and use a round brush when drying. This product is not greasy and does not leave any residue. Plus it smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product for fine hair.</li>
