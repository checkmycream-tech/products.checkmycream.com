<ol>
      <li>Best eye cream on the market in my opinion.  </li>

      <li>A good alternative to the chemical eye creams!</li>
      <li>and this does a great job</li>
      <li>Great cream for eyes.  </li>
      <li>Great value for the money.</li>
      <li>purchased after reading all of the good reviews.  </li>
      <li>This eye cream, my first time using it was an eye opener, lol, very happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>That said, I find it works best if I really layer it on at night, so don&#x27;t skimp!</li>
      <li>I am trying to prevent as many wrinkles as I can!</li>
      <li>Love all the FAB products!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This is non-irritating and it feels nice going on.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comment on how effective it is for that issue.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s ok for moisturizing, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was able to put this cream on my lid and close to the lower lash line with no issues.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and have seen zero improvement of fine lines and wrinkles,crows feet,etc.</li>
      <li>Texture is light..</li>
      <li>The formula is creamy and light.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better then what I&#x27;ve tried yet nothing impressive and spending $ on products that don&#x27;t deliver sucks.</li>
      <li>This cream is perfect for day wear, light but moisturizing, and my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t glide over without depositing color like some heavy creams.</li>
      <li>It does go on nicely and has caused me no sensitivity so far with use.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild.</li>
      <li>This is very gentle and makes my eyes feel smooth.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I saw a huge improvement in the look of fine lines that were already there, but I didn&#x27;t see any new ones appear either.  </li>
      <li>I thought it had a strong, very chemical odor and did not like the squeeze tube.</li>
      <li>So far so good, I am only 20</li>
      <li>This is fantastic for my very sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>Very gentle ingredients.</li>
      <li>I believe I will be using a tube a month if I use it morning and night, so that is a $20.00 investment - just be aware.  </li>
      <li>I prefer something thick and rich in a nice jar.</li>
      <li>I use it on whole face.</li>
      <li>is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I love the way it sinks into my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of eye creams, in large part because the skin around my eyes can be really sensitive.  </li>
      <li>Finally I discovered First Aid Beauty!</li>
      <li>I gave it 3 stars because I have tried and disliked most eye creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin allergic to fragrance etc</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>My eyes became very swollen and the skin around the eyes very taunt and dry.  </li>
      <li>wow</li>
      <li>Put on at night and soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>The only thing I really like is that it keeps my eye area moisturized.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and thought this would help with dryness around eyes.  </li>
      <li>Also,I have sensitive skin and eyes and found no irritation issues.</li>
      <li>so I have yet to notice any major changes.</li>
      <li>I have very fine lines and dark circles, and I know there&#x27;s no magic potion besides tons of water and lots of sleep.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
      <li>I have tried so many eye creams over the past few years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  I use it on whole face.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I am only 20 so my eyes aren&#x27;t horrible so I have yet to notice any major changes. I am trying to prevent as many wrinkles as I can!</li>
    <li> I am always on the hunt for an eye cream that hydrates, reduces puffiness, is in my price range and doesn&#x27;t irriate my eyes - which are rediculously sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to put this cream on my lid and close to the lower lash line with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the lack of any odor and it&#x27;s consistancy.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  I have very sensitive, dry skin and it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel oily and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup smudge, but it does keep the eye area hydrated.  I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in puffiness as well.&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus is I don&#x27;t have to use much and this little tube lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Have had a reaction to numerous eye creams but not this one!! Works great and feels wonderful. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> purchased after reading all of the good reviews.  I have sensitive skin and thought this would help with dryness around eyes.  After using for a week, my under eye skin felt very tight and itchy.  I stopped using for awhile and tried again, with the same reaction.  My eyes became very swollen and the skin around the eyes very taunt and dry.  I must be allergic to something in it.  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> After reading the other the other reviews I was thinking I might notice a big change. It does go on nicely and has caused me no sensitivity so far with use.</li>
    <li> Love all the FAB products! This is very gentle and makes my eyes feel smooth. It&#x27;s not thick or harsh. There aren&#x27;t any tingling chemicals or burning sensations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of eye creams, in large part because the skin around my eyes can be really sensitive.  Some eye creams have actually made the skin around my eyes feel as though it was burning!  This is non-irritating and it feels nice going on.  I can&#x27;t say that I saw a huge improvement in the look of fine lines that were already there, but I didn&#x27;t see any new ones appear either.  I don&#x27;t have a big problem with dark circles, so I can&#x27;t comment on how effective it is for that issue.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> The only thing I really like is that it keeps my eye area moisturized. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and have seen zero improvement of fine lines and wrinkles,crows feet,etc. No improvement of puffiness. No improvement of dark circles. Very Slight radiance improvement. The scent is mild. Texture is light..Also,I have sensitive skin and eyes and found no irritation issues. I gave it 3 stars because I have tried and disliked most eye creams I&#x27;ve used. I keep going back to this one bc it&#x27;s better then what I&#x27;ve tried yet nothing impressive and spending $ on products that don&#x27;t deliver sucks.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many eye creams over the past few years. Finally I discovered First Aid Beauty! It is everything that I want in an eye cream ... just wish that the tube was not so small. My advice is to make it in at least 1 larger size. But it is creamy ... only takes a little bit ... is very moisturizing. I love it!</li>
    <li> This eye cream, my first time using it was an eye opener, lol, very happy with the results.  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is a ++.  I love the way it sinks into my skin.  I get out of the shower with my face still moist and apply immediately (as if to hold in the bit of remaining water on my face!  I agree with another reference in that the tube is quite small.  I believe I will be using a tube a month if I use it morning and night, so that is a $20.00 investment - just be aware.  the only thing in a non-positive way that I can say about this is that it has had no desirable effect on the black circles seen sometimes around my eye.  I am hopeful they will concoct that solution in their next phase of eye creams!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that this eye cream is horrible, it just didn&#x27;t do anything special. I thought it had a strong, very chemical odor and did not like the squeeze tube. I prefer something thick and rich in a nice jar. This just didn&#x27;t *wow* me and I sent it back.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for my very sensitive eyes. The formula is creamy and light. No stinging or burning the way  other eye creams do. Very gentle ingredients. I have not noticed any lightening in my very dark circles yet but It is too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin allergic to fragrance etc and this does a great job</li>
    <li> Best eye cream on the market in my opinion.  I have puffiness under my eyes &amp; this gets rid of it &amp; brightens up that area.</li>
    <li> I have very fine lines and dark circles, and I know there&#x27;s no magic potion besides tons of water and lots of sleep. I still try, though. This cream is perfect for day wear, light but moisturizing, and my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t glide over without depositing color like some heavy creams. However, there&#x27;s no difference in my skin texture or appearance.  So it&#x27;s ok for moisturizing, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> It does seem to reduce puffiness and bags around my eyes when i put it on at night. That said, I find it works best if I really layer it on at night, so don&#x27;t skimp! A good alternative to the chemical eye creams!</li>
    <li> Great cream for eyes.  Put on at night and soft in the morning.</li>
