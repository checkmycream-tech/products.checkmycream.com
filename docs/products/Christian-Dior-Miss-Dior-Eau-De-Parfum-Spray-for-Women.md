<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had smelled this in the department store and loved it, unfortunately what ever they sent me simply doesn&#x27;t smell as good very disappointed, wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
    <li> It seems that that I received a tampered with or a f.a.k.e. item. The box had been tampered with. Though I was still refunded my money, but beware and check for this issue when you ordered it. The original bar code was cut out and replaced with a sticker. The plastic wrap was then resealed with a sticker. Never expected Amazon to sell such an item.</li>
    <li> My wife had asked for this for Christmas. Smells good and makes her happy and my life better. No complaints.</li>
    <li> The EDP is authentic and smells just like the testers at sephora etc. great price on amazon!</li>
    <li> I received this in less time than I thought I would and my wife absolutely loves it! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i ordered the wrong perfume, istead of name i ordered price, best mistake i ever made love it, the smell is beautiful</li>
    <li> Product came exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Great gift for My girl</li>
    <li> This was a birthday present for my wife. She loves this parfum  and she wears it whenever we go out.</li>
    <li> This was a huge disappointment. I was in search of Miss Dior Cherie, my signature fragrance, and came to find they changed the name to simply Miss Dior. Well, they changed the fragrance too. It&#x27;s so disappointing- I don&#x27;t know why Dior would mess with such a good thing. If you&#x27;re hoping for the original Miss Dior Cherie keep looking, you won&#x27;t find it here.</li>
    <li> I thought this particular item had been listed as one of the best fragrances of 2012.  I bought this and the lotion for layering.  Did not WOW me and did not last that long.  My lesson: expensive does not necessarily equal the WOW factor.  My hubby liked it though.</li>
    <li> Great prices, no issues! Very satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> It was my fiancée&#x27;s bday present and she loved it... A classical and always modern fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her words: \\&quot;It smells super sexy\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my wife because I remembered we had tested one of the Miss Dior fragrances at the store and she loved it. I was not sure if this was the one she liked or the Miss Dior Cherie but I opted for this one. She loves it so maybe next time I&#x27;ll get her the other one.</li>
    <li> We love this.  It is subtle for a young teen.  I bought this for my teenage daughter, and it arrived promptly and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t like the product or price it&#x27;s just that the buyer should beware that Amazon does not let you return Perfume,&lt;br /&gt;We ordered 2 by 2 different accounts by accident and then could not return them.</li>
    <li> Do not buy the perfume from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t smell like Miss Dior!&lt;br /&gt;The scent wasn&#x27;t fresh at all, it smelled very heavy. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I ended up going to sephora to get the real thing!</li>
    <li> have been using it for 2 years and still love the smell. great product! One of the best perfume ever.</li>
    <li> I placed this order because the bottle that was shown displayed Miss Dior Cherie. I received Miss Dior. The parfume was in the same box as Miss Cherie, but when I finally ran out of the Miss Cherie that I already had, and went to open the box that was received I was shocked to discover that it was Miss Dior and NOT Miss Cherie. Although it smells nice it was not what I wanted, paid for, or was advertised as. The title states Christian Dior Miss Dior, and the bottle says Miss Cherie. The problem is that Christian Dior has been re-branding the Miss Cherie as Miss Dior and the Miss Dior as Miss Dior Original.It can get confusing, and if there had been a way that you can contact the seller to confirm that may have helped, but it also helps if the photos that are displayed are representing the correct merchandise. Buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> exactly what she wanted and exactly when I needed it! would buy from here again. this is requiring me to put to many words in this section</li>
    <li> This is a light and fresh scent; youthful but not cloying. It is a perfect springtime perfume and at a reasonable price.</li>
