      <li>This set seems very well made.</li>
      <li>but I notice that one of them is showing some rust so it must not be stainless steel.</li>
      <li>The picks were very helpful too.  </li>
      <li>This is just like a real dentist tool.</li>
      <li>The grips are comfortable, seem properly sized, and the steel seems to be of high quality.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I got just what I expected and they work fine.</li>
      <li>The metal ends are sufficiently short that they do not cause a problem with U.S. airport security (in my carryon), while still being very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>Bought it for the mirror, however the mirror part is very warpy (plastic) so impossible to use it to get a good view inside my son&#x27;s cavity-prone mouth.</li>
      <li>Right now just in a Ziploc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price could have been less - saw the exact for half the cost at a supermarket.</li>
      <li>In general have no problems with this product.</li>
      <li>The curved handles have a very small amount of give to them, and are comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>Picks are a little sharp, I&#x27;ve used other models that have a less-sharper point, but side ridges that seem to work better on plaque</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A great buy to keep teeth cleaned between dentist visits.</li>
    <li> Got this so I can see my teeth in the back. This is just like a real dentist tool. All the pieces are so impressive. The pick thing is very very sharp so be careful. Great purchase</li>
    <li> The pick and mirror are decent but the scalar (reason I bought the kit) is a stupid curved design with the scrape edge on inside of curve, this item is basically useless !</li>
    <li> Bought it for the mirror, however the mirror part is very warpy (plastic) so impossible to use it to get a good view inside my son&#x27;s cavity-prone mouth. It&#x27;s like trying to look in a silly mirror at a carnival. The other tools are fine, but now I have to buy something else to get a good mirror that actually works.</li>
    <li> My teeth are really clean now all thanks to these dental tools!</li>
    <li> This set seems very well made. (to a non-dentist) The grips are comfortable, seem properly sized, and the steel seems to be of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only add that the picking tools are very sharp (pointy). That&#x27;s not a knock on the product, I&#x27;d just say that people should use them with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> As promised, works nice. Cleans teeth well. A case would have been nice (I&#x27;ve seen some competitors offer those) as I am unsure how to store them. Right now just in a Ziploc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price could have been less - saw the exact for half the cost at a supermarket.</li>
    <li> I chose &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; because they serve a necessary but not fun chore.&lt;br /&gt;They seem perfectly adequate for the price.</li>
    <li> Simple and effective. Five stars because the item was exactly as described. I was looking for something to travel with and this set was perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Tools are alright, they work but are a little weak. You get what you pay for. Would buy again though.</li>
    <li> Tools worked great,  i really only use the mirror on my children&#x27;s teeth to see the hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> These picks work very good but I notice that one of them is showing some rust so it must not be stainless steel. I will have to be sure they are dry when not being used.</li>
    <li> Good buy. Quite pointy - be careful. Does the job.</li>
    <li> These worked pretty well.  With the aid of the mirror, i was able to see where the spot i typically miss when brushing, so I&#x27;ve been focusing on it mostly now.  The picks were very helpful too.  They keep my mouth clean between dentist visits.</li>
    <li> Rather nice looking set of dental tools which I will be returning.  Perhaps in the past they were made in the USA as the ad states, however the set I received clearly states Made in CHINA on the back of the packaging.</li>
    <li> As expected, easy grip, got exactctly what I wanted. I don&#x27;t like the word requirement of this site at all.</li>
    <li> The dental tools were ok, and I love the non-fog mirror it came with, but the scalar is WAY too flimsy to actually do anything. My opinion, just buy something else that is all in solid metal or something that has solid metal through the rubber/plastic handle. The flimsiness is just deterring me from purchasing anything else from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> In general have no problems with this product. Does what it advertises. Seems to be of decent quality. No major problems.</li>
    <li> I love this. Helps keep teeth extra clean in between dental visits. Good product to have on hand. The quality is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about a set of simple dental tools.  I got just what I expected and they work fine.</li>
    <li> Not too sturdy but pretty good. Should have just bought in stores.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to have on hand when wanting to clean teeth between visits to the dentist.  I like having the mirror to be able to do my own quick check.  The pick is nice for handy cleaning also.</li>
    <li> Picks are a little sharp, I&#x27;ve used other models that have a less-sharper point, but side ridges that seem to work better on plaque</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the mirror so far, but it works and it seems to be good quality.  I bought it for a specific purpose, I thought I&#x27;d just be using it once, but I&#x27;ve found myself using it regularly -- it has caused a strange fascination with looking at my teeth...  Perhaps that is a bad thing???</li>
    <li> I use to clean around my braces. If you aren&#x27;t a dentist, don&#x27;t go crazy.</li>
    <li> These tools met my need for portable dental care that will conform to airport security rules.  The metal ends are sufficiently short that they do not cause a problem with U.S. airport security (in my carryon), while still being very sturdy.  The curved handles have a very small amount of give to them, and are comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> I clean my cat&#x27;s teeth to avoid traumatic vet visits. I job shadowed with a vet once and a cat almost died during a routine teeth cleaning from the anesthesia. I learned how to do it myself after that. These dental tools were perfect for this function.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy when you start young and the dog or cat trusts you. I wouldn&#x27;t use them on my own teeth. My dad was a dentist and has seen too many people try to do home care and cause more harm than good.</li>
    <li> Great dental tools for the price</li>
    <li> Good product! Easy to handle tools that do the job.</li>
    <li> If you wish you had gone to dental school or you simply like having your teeth REALLY clean .... OR you&#x27;re sick of shelling out for a cleaning this is the product for you. Although, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d forego the cleaning in favor of the do-it-yourself approach - but these *are* great for day to day use (or if you&#x27;re simply looking for a way to procrastinate or avoid doing something else in the bathroom, like, say, cleaning the toilet).</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Would not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Not sure how one can rate these tools a 5 i give them a very high 4. A 5 would be if they worked by themselves</li>
    <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect. In hindsight I should have ordered one with a light up mirror.</li>
    <li> Works just as I hoped.  Now maybe my hygienist will lighten up!</li>
