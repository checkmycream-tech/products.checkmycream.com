      <li>well the smell is the same what is good.</li>
      <li>You do not need it full strength you could dilute it with 1/3 water to 2/3 shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Most of all, I think the ingredients are decent and</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s fabulous, really!</li>
      <li>My hair has never been more soft!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair has never been more soft! I&#x27;d loved Nature&#x27;s Gate back in the 90&#x27;s (when I could only find it at my local food co-op), and tough times caused me to start buying &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; shampoo...but now I can get my favorite shampoo here for hardly any more than I&#x27;ve been paying for yucky shampoo!</li>
    <li> I bought this when we didn&#x27;t have any where else we could find locally.  It is still my favorite cleansing shampoo.  You do not need it full strength you could dilute it with 1/3 water to 2/3 shampoo.  Oh, did I mention the smell, it&#x27;s fabulous, really!</li>
    <li> Works great on my fine/oily hair.  Keeps it clean without over drying.  Not loving the scent, however.  Smells like grandma perfume, guess I&#x27;ll have to get used to it for a few months tho!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo, but this is the second large bottle I have bought from this company and the second time the pump has come in peices and the package dripping with product. This shampoo was in a mailer bag, the seller just put a piece of packing tape over the pump to keep it down. When it came to my house the package was leaking product. The pump was destroyed. I just bought the matching conditioner a week ago and guess what? Even though it was in a box the pump was still destroyed! The shampoo itself is great. I dont use anything else and will never change.</li>
    <li> used at a bed and breakfast and loved it so bought some to use at home. a bit pricey but good.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this brand. It is very affordable for a natural product, and it&#x27;s always vegan and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are very natural and subtle after you&#x27;ve washed your hair. Since they aren&#x27;t perfume-y, my boyfriend uses them as well, without smelling &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;. Saves money and space.</li>
    <li> Having tried a range of shampoos I&#x27;ve gone back to Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Daily shampoo and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s my favorite. Paul Mitchell Awapuhi and Loma moisturizing shampoo were also good for me, so if either of those works for you then Nature&#x27;s Gate should be a good bet. I like it because it&#x27;s good to my hair, leaving it soft (but too soft like aloe shampoos), and doesn&#x27;t cause a reside buildup. Most of all, I think the ingredients are decent and I like Nature&#x27;s Gate as a company. EWG&#x27;s SkinDeep project gives it a score of 4 (where 0 is the best and 10 the worst) but actually their biggest concern among the ingredients is with \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; which is very non-specific, so I&#x27;m not too concerned with ingredient safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 32 ounce version to reduce packaging but actually the pump dispenser is not a big benefit for me and it makes recycling a little more tricky (more parts with different materials), so I&#x27;ll stick to the smaller 18 ounce bottles in future I think. The plastic is made with post-consumer material and is also recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoiding sulfates in shampoos is a big trend at the moment. The bottom line is that traditional surfactants that contain sulfate such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) are not ideal for two reasons: they can irritate sensitive skin and can also cause excessive stripping of natural oils from your hair. Nature&#x27;s gate use milder surfactants and also include seed oils (jojoba, borage) and several plant extracts to minimize dehydration or damage to your hair and scalp. As a result, you should experience less damage to your hair/scalp if you wash frequently and/or suffer from dry scalp, dandruff, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is paraben-free. What are parabens, anyway? They are widely used as preservatives in shampoo, cosmetics, etc. and recently it was found that they can act as weak endocrine disruptors. There is still uncertainty on whether they can significantly add to the risk of breast cancer in women or sterility in men but another concern is that they may pose an environmental risk: they can combine with chlorine in water and these new molecules persist for longer in aquatic systems. I think it&#x27;s prudent to avoid them but we need to be also aware of what&#x27;s being used as a substitute. Nature&#x27;s gate uses phenoxyethanol which looks like a safer bet based on current data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sustainability: Nature&#x27;s Gate in general use post-consumer cardboard and plastic for packaging and soy-based inks for printing. Their products are also cruelty free and contain no animal-derived ingredients. Some of their plant ingredients are grown at a nearby farm (reducing fuel use) that uses rainwater and runoff from the Sierra Nevada snowpack for water supply. They also support WaterAid, which promotes rainwater solutions to provide clean drinking water in developing countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ll give Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Daily shampoo 5/5 gold stars for quality of the product and 5/5 \\&quot;green\\&quot; stars based on the social and environmental aspects of producing it. I would prefer if the botanicals were organically grown but even still, I think it just squeaks by with five green stars.s that they may pose an environmental risk: they can combine with chlorine in water and these new molecules persist for longer in aquatic systems.

    <li> Great shampoo, been using for years now</li>
    <li> I love using this shampoo. The mixture of various herbs, with lavender standing out, is a great touch and leaves my hair smelling great. Plain and simple, this shampoo is fantastic and I think if you try it you&#x27;ll feel the same way. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Smells and feels great, scent isn&#x27;t too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- A bit expensive, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo along with the conditioner and it has been great -- I am definitely a convert.  My hair feels clean after use, but it does not feel stripped or dried out like it does with some more widely circulated shampoos.  I always thought I had dull, light brown hair, but this shampoo along with the matching conditioner have brought out a multidimensional color - a coppery, shiny color - that I never knew my hair had.  Also, my hair in general feels healthier and stronger than it did before I started using Nature&#x27;s Gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference, but I love the strong scent of the shampoo.  It reminds me of a very potent herbal tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly bought this because I&#x27;m trying to use less and less chemicals in my beauty and hygiene products.  Thanks to my great experience with the herbal shampoo and conditioner, I am going to slowly start changing out my regular product for Nature&#x27;s Gate products.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great price and it smells wonderful. Would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Great cusomer service. Product as promised.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for our daughter who will only use natural products.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works wonderfully.  Really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> This is our family&#x27;s favorite shampoo. Both my husband and I love the herbal smell, and the shampoo does a great job cleaning hair. We both use the shampoo a couple times a week, so the 32 oz. size lasts us a long time! Some sulfate-free, natural shampoos I&#x27;ve tried feel like they don&#x27;t really do the job and my hair is still greasy even if I wash it every day. Conventional shampoos &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my hair, but actually strip the life right out of it. This shampoo cleans and brightens my hair without irritating my scalp or stripping it of its natural oils. I find that my hair is much easier to style, I have fewer split ends and frizz, and my stylist compliments how much body my hair has. The only downside to the shampoo is that some residue does eventually build up, so I rinse with a water/vinegar mix about once a month to get rid of that. I also use Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner, and love that as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great cruelty free product. Smells nice and is very gental on my hair, great for every day use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very strong smelling, though the smell is pleasant. I would love to dilute it, but then it wouldn&#x27;t lather well. The trick to using the sulfate free shampoos are to generously wet your hair before using and emulsify the shampoo in your hands before applying. My hair is about down to my ribs and it takes 3-5 generous pumps to feel like the natural oils are broken through. But, I only have to shampoo 2-3 times per week. I would recommend it. They could dial back on the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love natures gate, dislike this scent. Very fragrant!</li>
    <li> I liked this product the perfume is a bit strong but after you rinse it leaves a nice scent in the hair.  I found that my hair which is normally oily was a little stiffer and dryer than normal.  But nothing major, IF I had dry hair I would not use this product.  All in all I liked it and use it on my children and they like it too.</li>
    <li> Sow the shampoo on amazon. Didn&#x27;t need it  yet but thought I&#x27;d go ahead and buy it. So I&#x27;d have it when I ran out.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite herbal shampoo. I have fine, straight hair. Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal shampoo is light and creamy like whipped cream but has an earthy herbal texture and scent. It makes my hair feel thicker, softer and smell great. It feels luxurious. I started buying this shampoo as a substitute for Bumble and Bumble Cr&amp;egrave;me De Coco shampoo that I love but it is too expensive ($25 for a 8 oz bottle vs. $7 for Nature&#x27;s Gate 18 oz). I bought this shampoo at a local health food store and have been loving it ever since. It might even be better than the Bumble and Bumble in regards to healthier, more natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair dries, it has more volume because of this shampoo. I also use it with the Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal conditioner. Both the conditioner and the shampoo has a creamy soft consistency when massaging it into your hair. I like to leave it in to let my hair soak it up for a few minutes. My scalp feels happier when I use this conditioner. I often get compliments from other women that my hair smells nice, an herbal scent. That is because of the rosemary, lavender, sage and other herbal extracts. I feel good knowing that this shampoo and conditioner contains primarily natural herbal ingredients.</li>
    <li> Washes fine, but leaves dried hair feeling almost greasy, probably because it&#x27;s difficult to rinse out. The scent is also extremely strong, so if you&#x27;re looking for something milder, look elsewhere. Overall, it doesn&#x27;t feel so much natural as it feels cheap. By comparison, I&#x27;d prefer Not Your Mother&#x27;s, Jason, or Avalon Organics, but this is clearly the cheapest. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other varieties of Nature Gate shampoo with much better success. This particular formulation leaves my hair feeling very dry and straw-like.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, the smell is amazing. I&#x27;m natural so this shampoo really helps with my natural hair. It&#x27;s not harsh on my hair and makes it soft. I use it once or twice a week and it does wonders on my hair. I&#x27;ve used other shampoos and they can&#x27;t compare to Nature&#x27;s Gate. The seller was prompt with shipping, it arrived on time. This was a great shopping experience.</li>
    <li> The smell is too much like pechuli or something equivalent.  Its an ok shampoo but I do not like how my hair looks after. Its soft but a bit frizzy (long curly hair).  I love Natures Gate products but would pick something else from their line next time.</li>
    <li> I love this Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Shampoo and its partner conditioner. It&#x27;s more natural than other shampoos and the smell is heavenly...that is, if you like crunchy, hippie, earthy smells. It&#x27;s a VERY strong herbal scent. If you like patchouli, cedar, etc...you will love this. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as others due to the natural products but it does a little, and my hair rinses squeaky clean. I highly recommend this - great deal on a 32oz.</li>
    <li> I am a WEN user, but the WEN tea tree has been turning my silver hair slightly yellow. Just got this and used it today. Gives my hair a great shine. The smell is great and not overwhelming. Even lathers a little without sulfate. Keeping this product. I&#x27;m becoming a fan.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo a year ago in the old packaging. It was the best shampoo ever. I had a feeling of great clean hair. An the quality of my hair got so much better . even my hairdresser said what happened to my hair because they looked just awesome. So I found the shampoo I was looking for for years. After a year I had to buy a new one. So it was in new packaging. Web site say shampoo is the same what is new is just the new bottle . well the smell is the same what is good. But Well I don&#x27;t agree. I am dissapontet. My hair is heavy. No volume. Even the consistency changed and the colour of the shampoo. Very big disappointment. I ordered from Germany so was way more expensive to get it here.  I give one star because I love the old one. But hate the new one.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I like there are no chemicals in the product.  The only down side is I seem to get a build up if I use the shampoo a few times in a row.  So I usually switch &amp; use another shampoo to avoid such.</li>
    <li> got for my grandaughter and she loves it.  also the conditioner is one of her favs and the bath gel is a great also good</li>
    <li> This is a gentle way to clean and nourish your hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark borwn and very fine; this shampoo cleans it gently and makes it shine.&lt;br /&gt;It is best used with the complementary conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;While I am allergic to many other products that make my scalp break-out; these 2 products are so gentle that I have no adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great distribution channel; the price is great and it ships promptly</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. Has a wonderful scent that is unisex and makes an awesome body wash.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and scent shampoo. It is so lovely. I always get compliments on how good I smell and this shampoo is part of the reason.</li>
    <li> I love the product but only giving it 3 stars because I was very disappointed with the packaging. I  opened the box and shampoo was everywhere. Now I can&#x27;t enjoy my fav shampoo, boo</li>
    <li> Love the product leaves my hair feeling and smelling great. Only challenge is the pump. It&#x27;s make of inferior quality.</li>
    <li> Love Nature&#x27;s gate! It is really great for your hair. I have natural hair (African American) and it doesn&#x27;t try out my hair and actually encourages my curls!</li>
    <li> Wish the pump was more reliable. doesn&#x27;t prime well, but I just transfer the shampoo to a squeeze bottle. Thanks</li>
