    <li> Great product.  Hard to find in Retail stores.  I use to purchase it in TJMaxx but haven&#x27;t seen it there in a long time.  I can usually go a full 7 days with no chipping!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> The best top coat I&#x27;ve used!  After my manicure, I always use this top coat when I get home for added protection and shine. It works like a charm and keeps my color fresh until my next appointment. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 years with great success.</li>

    <li> Probably my favorite top coat! It&#x27;s not goopy and dries pretty fast. Wonderful coverage and a great shine! Not severely pungent either. I feel like it really does help my manicures last longer, especially because I&#x27;m prone to picking a peeling.</li>
    <li> Not happy with purchase.  This polish is suppose to be clear as I have purchased it at a store before.  The one I received had a pink tint to it. This is not a inexpensive polish so I will not purchase from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is suppose to be clear but has a yellow tint. I guess I recieved an old one. I recommend purchasing in store instead so you are able to take a look at it or return it without any hassles.</li>
    <li> Protect you manicure so you don&#x27;t ruin it.</li>
    <li> Great speed dry top coat.  Works well over glitter.</li>
    <li> This quick dry product actually works.  I have the bad habit of polishing my nails just before walking out the door.  This quick dry does exactly what it promises.  My nails are usually dry before I get to my car.</li>
    <li> My nails chip so much I usually never bother with painting them, I read up about this product and figured I&#x27;d try it. It&#x27;s the only top coat I&#x27;ve used for the past 2 months and I love it. Dries quick and really lasts.</li>
    <li> I really like this product; it is quick drying and does indeed extend a manicure. I have used this product for years, but I think they may have changed their formula more recently. Not as good as it was originally, but still a great product.</li>
    <li> I apply this on my nails two or three days after my manicure. It has a great shine and dries quickly. This truly keeps my at home manicure lasting longer.</li>
    <li> This product is the very best for extending your manicure.   It gives your polished nails new shine that lasts for days!   I originally purchased one bottle - after trying it a few times I bought 6 more!   Just love it!</li>
    <li> Lasts about 2 weeks.  Great for when you don&#x27;t want to spend money at a nail salon and want to do it at home.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used. Definitely gives you a few extra days before any chips start.</li>

    <li> This topcoat is the shiznit! I had been using OPI&#x27;s Top Coat and no matter how long my dry time was, I still got impressions (so frustrating!).
