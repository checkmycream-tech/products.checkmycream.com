    <li> Butt Face Soap will make a great stocking stuffer for my friends and family members who have great senses of humor or who are germaphobes or both. I purchased one bar, but plan to purchase more, as I know many people who will get quite the laugh out of this when the open the soap. I particularly like the two-toned color, as I think it&#x27;s appropriate regarding the message the manufacturer wants to convey. I also like the tongue in cheek packaging that states it&#x27;s for cheek-to-cheek cleaning. All I can say is what a hoot! I think people of all ages and both genders will get a kick out of this product.</li>
    <li> gave this as a gag gift.  we all had a good laugh!  I wouldn&#x27;t actually use this product though.  i wonder if the people making this in China think we&#x27;re that stupid, we needed the reminder.  HA!</li>
    <li> thanks for the quickness</li>
    <li> A thoughtful gift for someone you love...</li>
    <li> This is hilarious!  Makes a great gag gift.  I&#x27;d recommend it for that friend that you can&#x27;t think of anything for but they have a good sense of humor (everyone has one).</li>
    <li> My brother thought this was hilarious. He&#x27;s potty training two kids. The whole bathroom scene got a bit scary. Humor always helps.</li>
    <li> I work in IT support, and we that do know that \\&quot;users\\&quot; have trouble following directions.  This product&#x27;s instructions are clear.  Everyone loved it.</li>
    <li> Awesome funny gift for my brother for xmas! Mom thought it was the best thing she had ever seen.</li>
    <li> Sent this to a little cousin in college as a funny gag gift.  Was very well received.  Would def buy this or one like it again!  :)</li>
    <li> Good value for it&#x27;s purpose of a gag gift!  Haven&#x27;t used the soap so can&#x27;t review that.... but soap goes great with butt/face towel. Recommend product.</li>
    <li> ordered this as a gift to give with the butt face towel.  It&#x27;s wrapped so don&#x27;t know its fragrance but I like thejoke involved.</li>
    <li> The soap I received was not like the picture. All white on one side and all PURPLE on the other. But on a plus side, the soap smells really good :)</li>
    <li> Item was as described and shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gag gift.  Got a few laughs.</li>
    <li> great for Christmas Yankee swaps.</li>
    <li> If you have a sibling, in-law, or even a best friend, this soap is exactly what you need to tell them how you feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it will help them cleanse themselves, but your opinion of their status as a butt face will be made abundantly clear.</li>
    <li> Best white elephant gift!!</li>
    <li> Very funny as a gag gift.  Very well received and gets a great laugh at parties.  Will order again for Secret Santa gifts!</li>
    <li> This is not the bar of soap you will get.  You will get the same kind everyone else is selling.  ALL white on one side(inclusing letters) and all brown on the other side (inclduing letters)</li>
    <li> Great product. Good for a laugh. But I mixed them up in the shower two weeks ago and still am afraid my face smells like butt. Haven&#x27;t been out in public. Awfull.</li>
    <li> Ok I used it as a prank gift for my boyfriend (24 B-day), and it was  pretty funny, but as far as the product quality, it&#x27;s a very cheap soap, it has a weird concistency, It&#x27;s a soap that you don&#x27;t feel soo clean after using it, I&#x27;d say it is just like a back up soap, for that unfortunate day that you run out of you regular shower soap and you are already in the shower</li>
    <li> What a goofy gift!  It&#x27;s going under the tree for my brother in law for Christmas.  I can&#x27;t wait to see his reaction.  Wish the packaging was a little more exciting though. Maybe a Tin, or even just a clever cardboard box would be nice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap, it did not give me a rash, and it got me clean, what more is soap suppose to do?</li>
    <li> This was very appropriate for a family &amp;#34;silly&amp;#34; gift exchange.  All loved it!  Glad I found it on amazon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gag gift. Recipient loved it!</li>
    <li> The soap isn&#x27;t amazing in itself, but the design is so funny and amazing - it&#x27;s a wonderful and hilarious gift idea!  It&#x27;s exactly as pictured - one side says &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s white for your clean face, and the other side is brown for your dirty butt and says &amp;#34;butt.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I just showered for the first time with this soap. Be very careful, when I went to brush my teeth I accidentally rubbed my brush on the wrong side and now I have s***ty breath. Besides that when you use the butt side of the soap it most definitely touches a butt cheek to the face side of soap. Unless you have an abnormally wide crack or only have one bum cheek I would recommend buying lever 2000. It&#x27;s for all your body&#x27;s 2000 parts. Face butt soap is just for 2 body parts and my shower isn&#x27;t large enough to have 999 more bars of soap to get all my other parts washed. It&#x27;s a good idea just not practical in today hustle and bustle life style.</li>
    <li> This soap is a fun gift to get someone with a good sense of humor.  The white side of the soap says &amp;#34;Face&amp;#34; and the brown side of the soap says &amp;#34;Butt&amp;#34; so you know which side to use for each body part!  The soap is packaged in plastic wrap so you can clearly see both sides before you open it.  As far as functionality, the soap was larger than expected - about the size of a regular bar of soap.  It has a nice floral fragrance and cleans well.  The words are carved deeply in each side so I imagine it would take some time for them to disappear.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The people who shipped this did an amazing job! They got it to me 3 days before they said they would and it was during Christmas time. They said I would get it on the 26th after Christmas but it showed up on Christmas Eve and I was so happy!</li>
    <li> best gag gift yet!  definitely did the job.  the package has never been opened so I cant really attest for the functionality of the soap but it sure is fun getting to see who gets stuck with it after the party</li>
    <li> The idea is fun, but the package is a bit too basic, the soap does not look like make from good material. For $6, I expect it will be more elegant or pack it like a gift item. No just a bar of soap!</li>
    <li> This was for a white elephant present exchange. It was a great gift for a prank.</li>
    <li> This is one bar of soap; not two.  It is double sided with one imprint on one side and the opposite on the other.  I bought this for my sons stocking and he thought it was funny.  It is a nice size bar of soap that does smell nice.</li>
    <li> Got as a gift for my brother (S)</li>
    <li> For the times when you need to wash your butt and face at the same time. A nice gag gift to bring some life to a party.</li>
    <li> I jokingly call my boyfriend a butt face all the time so this was the perfect gag gift for Christmas. He loved it!</li>
    <li> Made me laugh... Was what i expected it to be. Made for a great christmas white elephant gift. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My 7 year old son thought this was HILARIOUS!  It has been floating in the bathtub, dragged to the sink, and brought out for him to show friends and has stayed all in one piece and the lettering is deep, so it hasn&#x27;t worn off yet.  It has a nice fragrance (strong too), so fortunately it doesn&#x27;t smell like butt :)  I would definitely recommend this soap for a good laugh.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a white elephant gift this year and was so unique, it was perfect. Not sure how the soap smelled or lathered, since I did not get to bring it home, but it was packaged nicely, and was a generous size. Great gag gift!</li>
    <li> Bought as a white elephant gift.  Got tons of laughs!  And people fought over this gift - in a good way.  That&#x27;s what I hoped for and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great socking stuffers. Got lots of laughs!</li>
    <li> I got this for my brother in law for a christmas present last year. He thought is was HALARIOUS. Last year he sent us poo pouri (which is like smell that you spray in the toilet before going number 2). HAHA! So this gift was perfect for him. Not sure if he acutally used it or not, and not sure what it smells like or anything, but if your looking for a gag gift, this one is funny.</li>
    <li> Made a great gift for some one who enjoys novelty items.  Nothing to complain about.  Good size soap as well</li>
    <li> My gag gift list was complete this Xmas because of this handy little piece of lathering goodness. It got tons of laughs and was a party favorite!</li>
    <li> Appropriate gift for some...</li>
    <li> Got as a funny gift for a military friend at basic, everyone in his group got a kick out of it</li>
    <li> The separation of butt and face are long overdue.</li>
    <li> My mom loved it as a gag Christmas present.</li>
    <li> My bother&#x27;s pretty silly, and he likes gag gifts as regular presents. This was perfect for him. It&#x27;s not revolutionary obviously, but it&#x27;s nice for laughs and hopefully continued smiles for him in the future.</li>
    <li> I noticed that there is, at the time of writing this review, one \\&quot;used\\&quot; butt face soap available for sale. Thank you kind sir, or madam, but I&#x27;ll pass on your used butt face soap.</li>
    <li> joke gift for my dad, he laughed so hard, great purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this as a white elephant gag gift.  It was a huge hit!  The person that got this laughed hysterically when they opened the gift.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap for my brother-in-law as part of his Christmas gift.  He thought it was funny.  You have to know your audience.</li>
    <li> My grandson is 11, and this paired with the butt/face towel was the perfect gift! And he is hard to buy for normally!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for a coworker I do not like, and she was insulted.  Yay! Plus, I found it quite hilarious.  The butt side wasn&#x27;t quite the brown color it was shown as, but that may have just been mine.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law has a gag-gift gift exchange each year, but the limit is only $5.00. Finding funny, yet still useable gifts (I don&#x27;t like wasting money) is sometimes a hard venture. When I saw this soap I thought it&#x27;d be perfect for the exchange! It was right around my budget, practical, and funny! The perfect gag-gift gift exchange gift.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Funny&lt;br /&gt;Got here fast&lt;br /&gt;Nice packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It looks like it may have been in a warehouse or something where the soap started to melt a little and it&#x27;s slightly smudged on the packaging, so that&#x27;s disappointing. It&#x27;s not bad enough that I want to send it back, but it crossed my mind. I&#x27;m sure after one use the melted part will be smooth again and it will still be funny when it&#x27;s given.</li>
    <li> Went over well at our Christmas party when we exchanged gifts. Anyone wanting a unique gift I would recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> NICE GIFT, I THINK IT&#x27;S WORTH THE MONEY, IT LOOKS LIKE REGULAR SOAP AND SMELLS GOOD. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> This is a lot bigger than I expected, I guess I didn&#x27;t read the dimensions.  That makes it funnier though, because you can see the words clearly.  It comes in a plastic packaging with cardboard title header.  The picture made the &amp;#34;Butt&amp;#34; side look black, but I think it&#x27;s actually a dark brown/burgundy.</li>
    <li> This is just a lot smaller than I had expected.  It is still funny but just not very big.  It is one pieace with the face on one side and the butt on the other.  They are still a good gag gift.</li>
    <li> This is a fun gift to give. The quality of the soap is good and makes for a good laugh!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gag gift for my nephew and he loves it. Great customer experience - A+ + +</li>
    <li> This was the last gift to be stolen and was stolen many times.  Huge hit and got a lot of laughs.  Hint is to wrap so that \\&quot;face\\&quot; is the first thing seen when opening.</li>
    <li> This was a funny gift to give to people! It was for great laughs and it was a nice price.</li>
    <li> Great white elephant gift! It was a hit along with the butt/face towels i purchased.</li>
    <li> This was a gag gift for my boyfriend. He got a good laugh out of it and does use it!</li>
    <li> Was a gift and went over great.  Got some good laughs out of it.  Hope recipient is using the soap.</li>
    <li> My 10 yr old son received this as a gift for Christmas and he loved it!  Great smelling soap, now I just hope he uses it!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly well made product. I was expecting a gag gift sort of quality but after using the product I noticed it was bigger than expected, lathered on well and thick, and has a surprisingly nice aroma to it. I would definitely recommend as either a gag gift to a friend or a legitimate bar of soap for your face and butt!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda on the small side.</li>
    <li> Perfect gag gift for our Christmas Eve party!</li>
    <li> Just didnt like that the butt side had a white film on it</li>
    <li> Bought this soap set as a gag gift for my boss.  I hope he was not offended.  The soap quality looks good, and the words were easy to read.  FUN gift!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these and they were a hit with each and every person who received them.  I have no idea what the quality of the soap is like or how it smells (lol!), but it&#x27;s a pretty quality-size block of soap!</li>
