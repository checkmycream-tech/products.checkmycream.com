    <li> These blades last a long time, they&#x27;re really sharp and stay that way even after 5+ uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a barber you might want to use something like the Dovo shavette since you&#x27;d be throwing out blades all the time, and Derby&#x27;s blades are $5 for 100</li>
    <li> great straight blade will buy again when i need more! can be deadly and can cut you easily.  personna is good!</li>
