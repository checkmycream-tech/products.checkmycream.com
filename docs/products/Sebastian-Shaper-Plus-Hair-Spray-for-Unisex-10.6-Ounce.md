      <li>It&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>This is the best hair spray and this was the best price came right away had no problem with it</li>
      <li>Love this hairspray, the price was great!!</li>
      <li>Not as good as it use to be.</li>
      <li>Good hold</li>
      <li>It holds without stiffness, and it smells good.  </li>
      <li>I have used this hair product for years and years and love it!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It is the very best product of its kind for my fine, straight hair.  </li>
      <li>Always have great success with Sebastian Shaper Plus Hair Spray.</li>
      <li>I love Sebastian hair spray and will order again.  </li>
      <li>Love it  </li>
      <li>I love Shaper</li>
      <li>Received it fast and the price was great too.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Use every day -- for many many years.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did.  </li>
      <li>My favorite hairspray ever.</li>
      <li>I love this spray because as it holds your hair as it leaves your hair</li>
      <li>but as you go through the day you end up with beautiful movement, soft hair that stays in place.</li>
      <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
      <li>and it is super handy.</li>
      <li>Perhaps hair spray isn&#x27;t an easy product to put in the mail for some reason????</li>
      <li>Have only used this hairspray for 20+ years, the best and does not make curly hair curlier, sets it just right.</li>
      <li>This stuff works with my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>However, if you like a light spray that isn&#x27;t sticky, you&#x27;ll probably like this one.</li>
      <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>light-weight, brushes right out!  </li>
      <li>Seems like an okay hair spray, but after 10 uses, it was completely out of pressure so nothing would spray out.</li>
      <li>The bottle says to run the nozzle under hot water if it gets clogged, but that didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
      <li>I first heard about it on a blog that I follow and decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>Bring back the original!</li>
      <li>This is a salon-type hair spray; but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough hold for me.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It has a huge scent the lingers long after spraying it on though.</li>
      <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>If you have fine limp hair this product has worked very well for me and is my #1 that I reach for daily!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t request a credit because by the time I returned the empty hair spray canister it wouldn&#x27;t have been worth the shipping charges.  </li>
      <li>Not worth it for me, but for short hair it would be fine.</li>
      <li>normally got it from my beauty supply house which cost double than what I bought it for at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and product as expected</li>
      <li>Plus it totally keeps the hold in my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or hard.</li>

<li> I use it in the mornings when I remove my flexi-rods; holds my layers together without making it too stiff, my hair is still bouncy at the end of the day.</li>
<li> but when I opened it and took the cap off the nozzle was loose and it looked like part of it had broken off and when I tried to spray my hair it fell off</li>
<li> and I was unable to get it back on and all the hair spray fizzled out of the can</li>
<li> I like the product, but a bit expensive to use on a daily basis.</li>
<li> And it seriously tastes awful.</li>

<ol>
    <li> came on time...just what I wanted...</li>
    <li> I like the SHAPER PLUS  but I received the regular shaper instead which  I DO NOT LIKE which I wont use!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The best hair spray.  Tried other. But keep coming back to sebastian. It does not leave your hair with that sticky feeling..  I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Hve used this product for a long time.  It&#x27;s great.  Received it fast and the price was great too.</li>
    <li> This hairspray feels a little stiff when applied but as you go through the day you end up with beautiful movement, soft hair that stays in place.</li>
    <li> Always have great success with Sebastian Shaper Plus Hair Spray.</li>
    <li> The hair spray was packedi well but when I opened it and took the cap off the nozzle was loose and it looked like part of it had broken off and when I tried to spray my hair it fell off and I was unable to get it back on and all the hair spray fizzled out of the can so I ended up paying for nothing.  Didn&#x27;t request a credit because by the time I returned the empty hair spray canister it wouldn&#x27;t have been worth the shipping charges.  Perhaps hair spray isn&#x27;t an easy product to put in the mail for some reason????</li>
    <li> it makes the hair too stiff and it makes my head itch</li>
    <li> I love Shaper Plus it totally keeps the hold in my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or hard. I use the smaller can when I travel and it is super handy. If you have fine limp hair this product has worked very well for me and is my #1 that I reach for daily! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Not as good as it use to be. Please...Bring back the original! Does not hold your hair style! Miss the good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used this hair product for years and years and love it!  It has a huge scent the lingers long after spraying it on though.</li>
    <li> It is the very best product of its kind for my fine, straight hair.  It holds without being stiff and never resembles &amp;#34;helmet hair.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is the size I was hoping for when the small travel size first came.  I love Sebastian hair spray and will order again.  Shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair and all other hairsprays weight my hair down.  This one does not.  Leaves my hair managable.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a salon-type hair spray; but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough hold for me.  I have short hair and like a spray that I can use to style and hold throughout the day.  However, if you like a light spray that isn&#x27;t sticky, you&#x27;ll probably like this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff works with my fine hair.  It holds without being stiff.  I use the extra hold.  It helps for styling, too.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product as expected</li>
    <li> The picture online of the product is not the same as I received.</li>
    <li> Seems like an okay hair spray, but after 10 uses, it was completely out of pressure so nothing would spray out. There&#x27;s plenty of liquid inside and you can hear it slosh around when you shake, but nothing comes out. The bottle says to run the nozzle under hot water if it gets clogged, but that didn&#x27;t help at all. I&#x27;m going to have to throw out the bottle because I can&#x27;t get at it. What a waste.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but a bit expensive to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray ever.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Sebastion Hair Spray. Good hold and you do not feel as though you have it on.  Hair is not heavy/weigthed down and you can get your fingers through it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair spray for years! It&#x27;s a great product and this is the best deal you can find.</li>
    <li> No, I&#x27;m not putting it in my mouth on purpose. But if your hair is long enough to reach your mouth and it&#x27;s windy, it happens. And it seriously tastes awful. Not worth it for me, but for short hair it would be fine.</li>
    <li> Use every day -- for many many years.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested I try this hair spray and I&#x27;m glad she did.  It holds without being stiff or sticky.  Worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Have only used this hairspray for 20+ years, the best and does not make curly hair curlier, sets it just right.</li>
    <li> Great product and price!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray and this was the best price came right away had no problem with it</li>
    <li> Best hairspray ever.  The only one I use!  Love it  Recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It holds without stiffness, and it smells good.  I first heard about it on a blog that I follow and decided to try it.  I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray ever!  light-weight, brushes right out!  Holds!</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray, the price was great!! Will order from here again!! Thanks</li>
    <li> This hairspray I have used for several years.  I love this spray because as it holds your hair as it leaves your hair touchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally got it from my beauty supply house which cost double than what I bought it for at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good. I use it in the mornings when I remove my flexi-rods; holds my layers together without making it too stiff, my hair is still bouncy at the end of the day.</li>
