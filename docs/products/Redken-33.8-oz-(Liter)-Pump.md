      <li>The color wouldn&#x27;t have mattered anyway, I LOVE not having to pick up the big huge bottle every time I&#x27;m in the shower, and they fit the Redken bottles perfectly.</li>

      <li>I use it with my Redken All Soft 33.8 oz shampoo bottle and it works great.  </li>
      <li>does what it says and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>The tubes were not attached to the pump but WERE included and easy to put on.</li>
      <li>They fit well and work fine.</li>
      <li>I did get the white pump and it works great.</li>
      <li>These pumps work fantastic in the shower.  </li>
      <li>These work great with the liter pump bottles and make it much easier to get the amount of shampoo/conditioner that you really need.</li>
      <li>You can still buy the big shampoo and transfer it to be reused again, qualiTy is good.</li>
      <li>I received my order quickly and it was as described.  </li>
      <li>I live in a small town &amp; it was great to be able to send off for the pump instead of driving an hour or so!</li>
      <li>It really helps me get what I need easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, solid pump that makes it a lot easer to get shampoo out of your liter bottle.</li>
      <li>These make it a sensible money saving decision to purchase the Redken shampoo and conditioner in the economy size bottles and the pump dispenses just the right amount of each.</li>
      <li>The pumps dispense just the right amount.</li>
      <li>Love the fact it can be changed so when they start selling smaller bottles</li>
      <li>She tried using it first and the pump would not work.</li>
      <li>After using what I thought was a successful pump in my 33 oz bottle of Redken shampoo, I simply removed the pump, placed it into the second bottle of Redken shampoo, it stopped pumping, pumped all day and nothing came out.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>So, I emailed the company, Smart Save, aka MidWest Beauty, and asked how to get it to pump again.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these to make using the large 33.8 oz bottles of shampoo easier.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t need to buy a new pump!!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
      <li>plus it&#x27;s much easier to handle.</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>Very unprofessional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It fit and gave equal amounts each pump.  </li>
      <li>So much for anything being sterile.  </li>
      <li>Secondly, cannot open the top of the pump at all.  </li>
      <li>received only the top part (the actual pump) with NO tube attached.</li>
      <li>The pump I highly recommended to purchase.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the issues that other buyers had, but these work great for me.  </li>
      <li>We used to have to buy new bottles for her after about 3-3.5 months of use.  </li>
      <li>Since buying these, that has moved to new bottles every 4-5 months.  </li>
      <li>Fits all large product containers such as shampoos and body washes.</li>
      <li>, please note, these pumps are REALLY hard to get the top to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; up, in order to pump.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;I can only suggest to wash it very thoroughly.</li>
      <li>No problems so far.</li>
      <li>The pumps looked new in condition, however, the description said these were white Redken pumps.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never received a product more poorly represented.</li>
      <li>Although it is not as well made as my previous pump it is certainly doing the job of pumping my Redken shampoo</li>
      <li>They were a gold color (not black, not clear).</li>
      <li>First of all, not a huge deal, but the pumps are blue, not white like what was stated.  </li>

<li> First of all, not a huge deal, but the pumps are blue, not white like what was stated.  </li>
<li> No more pouring too much product.</li>
<li> It was a little hard to get the pump to fit on the bottle</li>
<li> It looks like others have had a tough time with these pumps which is too bad because mine were perfect.</li>
<li> I have two completely USELESS pump heads as there are no stores in my area that sell just the plastic tube that will fit these pump heads.</li>
<li> I then took the pumps to figure out what the problem was and realized that the pump was a fraction too long for the bottle.</li>
<li> Should have bought this a long time ago!</li>
<li> They were a little long, but I would rather have them too long than too short.</li>
<li> so I could use the big bottles of Redken without having to transfer them to smaller easier to handle bottles, now the liter bottles sit in my shower and dispense easily, no muss no fuss.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s because the shampoo and conditioner were thick and it was hard to get them in the right spot.</li>
<li> I rcvd all 3 of the plain white pumps, which were the cheaper pumps.  </li>
<li> The only problem I had is the one pump has a small crack in it from shipping I believe.</li>
<li> both parts of product came apart from each other and i lost the stick.....</li>
<li> But usually these pumps are not for multiple uses.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> the pump is useless really !</li>
<li> I used a sharp knife to cut off less than 1/4 inch</li>
<li> I wish it was color coded for shampoo/conditioner but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
<li> I received black ones.</li>
<li> Mine came in white, with the tube, so they may have gotten their game together since some of the other posts.  </li>
<li> Third, doesn&#x27;t even fit the Redkin 33 oz bottle - completely disgusted.  </li>
<li> I had ordered a couple of the plain pumps as well, but the Redken pump for a Redken Liter of shampoo.  </li>
<li> That isn&#x27;t a big deal, except for the principle of wrongly describing a product to a customer, and misrepresenting it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Tube is way too short and they apparently don&#x27;t accept returns - very disappointed!</li>
<li> they serious??  </li>
<li> Again, not that big of a deal, but very disappointing, and misleading.  </li>

    <li> This is the one to get!</li>
    <li> I love not having to pick up my huge conditioner bottle now that I have this pump.  It really helps me get what I need easily.</li>
    <li> This is not AT ALL what I ordered.  First of all, not a huge deal, but the pumps are blue, not white like what was stated.  Secondly, cannot open the top of the pump at all.  Third, doesn&#x27;t even fit the Redkin 33 oz bottle - completely disgusted.  I&#x27;ve never received a product more poorly represented.</li>
    <li> Great product speedy service. Fits all large product containers such as shampoos and body washes.</li>
    <li> Should have bought this a long time ago!</li>
    <li> On time, fit bottles perfectly.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly.  It fit and gave equal amounts each pump.  Didn&#x27;t bend or lose suction,</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed and disgusted with the vendor for this purchase. The picture represents the plastic tube (that connects to the pump unit) and the pump head for sale (what was pictured/advertised).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received only the top part (the actual pump) with NO tube attached. I think if you are going to sell something and you post a picture that you actually receive what is ordered. I have two completely USELESS pump heads as there are no stores in my area that sell just the plastic tube that will fit these pump heads. Shame on you Midwest Beauty Supply for misrepresenting your products.</li>
    <li> This review is from: Redken 33.8 oz (Liter) Pump (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed and disgusted with the vendor for this purchase. The description represents this would be a &amp;#34;Redken&amp;#34; specific liter pump.  I had ordered a couple of the plain pumps as well, but the Redken pump for a Redken Liter of shampoo.  I rcvd all 3 of the plain white pumps, which were the cheaper pumps.  Not a big deal, BUT I paid $4.95 for the Redken pump, and the others were $2.73 each..  Again, not that big of a deal, but very disappointing, and misleading.  The packaging for these products was horrible.  No bags, or plastic, just the pump heads, and the plastic tubes, thrown into a shipping bag.  So much for anything being sterile.  Very unprofessional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Midwest Beauty Supply for misrepresenting your products. Will never purchase from again!</li>
    <li> A great product that came as described. After using it for a month or so I think it&#x27;s saving some shampoo and conditioner plus it&#x27;s much easier to handle. I wish it was color coded for shampoo/conditioner but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Durable, works well, and fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality shampoo pump. It is a must have if you buy your shampoo/ conditioner in the 33.8oz size.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to make using the large 33.8 oz bottles of shampoo easier. They fit the bottles great and work well. I received mine in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Will definitely help to save money on shampoo and conditioner use.</li>
    <li> does what it says and is easy to use. PERFECT - very happy with this purchase!!!! i&#x27;ll keep it for next bottle</li>
    <li> Works great…wish I had ordered them sooner.</li>
    <li> The pump is too short, once you get to the end of the bottle the pump is useless really !</li>
    <li> Goes well with my Redken 33.8 oz. shampoo bottles,  I have had the same pump for a year now, and it is still a-live and functional!</li>
    <li> I use it with my Redken All Soft 33.8 oz shampoo bottle and it works great.  No problems so far.</li>
    <li> Tube is way too short and they apparently don&#x27;t accept returns - very disappointed!</li>
    <li> My wife uses the big bottles of Redken products.  Using these pumps has saved me money.  We used to have to buy new bottles for her after about 3-3.5 months of use.  Since buying these, that has moved to new bottles every 4-5 months.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT SAVES ME IN THE AMOUNT OF SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER I USE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> After using what I thought was a successful pump in my 33 oz bottle of Redken shampoo, I simply removed the pump, placed it into the second bottle of Redken shampoo, it stopped pumping, pumped all day and nothing came out.  I wondered if I had to do something to it to get it going again but I couldn&#x27;t remember.  So, I emailed the company, Smart Save, aka MidWest Beauty, and asked how to get it to pump again.  This is a copy and paste of their response, I kid you not, this is what they said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I can only suggest to wash it very thoroughly. But usually these pumps are not for multiple uses.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they serious??  This is a pump of well made construction, it isn&#x27;t a cheapie at all.  It isn&#x27;t meant for multiple uses!!!  It is exactly what it is meant for!!!!  DON&#x27;T BUY THEM. USE REVIEWS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE!!</li>
    <li> Love the fact it can be changed so when they start selling smaller bottles I won&#x27;t need to buy a new pump!!</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly, which was great. The pumps looked new in condition, however, the description said these were white Redken pumps. I received black ones. That isn&#x27;t a big deal, except for the principle of wrongly describing a product to a customer, and misrepresenting it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please note, these pumps are REALLY hard to get the top to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; up, in order to pump. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to release the top...</li>
    <li> Worked great on ION bottle of shampoo. The Redkin ordered was shipped with a hole and was a nightmare situation.</li>
    <li> Works as expected so far. Seems well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the issues that other buyers had, but these work great for me.  Mine came in white, with the tube, so they may have gotten their game together since some of the other posts.  The color wouldn&#x27;t have mattered anyway, I LOVE not having to pick up the big huge bottle every time I&#x27;m in the shower, and they fit the Redken bottles perfectly.</li>
    <li> These work very well.</li>
    <li> No clogs!! Great pump.</li>
    <li> These work great with the liter pump bottles and make it much easier to get the amount of shampoo/conditioner that you really need.</li>
    <li> Great pump for all Redken shampoo/conditioner. You can still buy the big shampoo and transfer it to be reused again, qualiTy is good.</li>
    <li> Bought these so I could use the big bottles of Redken without having to transfer them to smaller easier to handle bottles, now the liter bottles sit in my shower and dispense easily, no muss no fuss. These make it a sensible money saving decision to purchase the Redken shampoo and conditioner in the economy size bottles and the pump dispenses just the right amount of each.</li>
    <li> the liter Redken shampoo should come with these - silly that you have to buy the pump.Pump works perfect.</li>
    <li> Fit my Redken liters perfectly! I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> both parts of product came apart from each other and i lost the stick..... it could have come together so i wouldn&#x27;t lose it</li>
    <li> The pump is perfect fit for the 33oz redken shampoo bottle and works famously. The pump I highly recommended to purchase.</li>
    <li> I received and got this pump in a timely fashion. It is long and fits perfect on a 33.8 bottle.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The pump arrived quickly &amp; works great! I would buy from them again! I live in a small town &amp; it was great to be able to send off for the pump instead of driving an hour or so!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice, solid pump that makes it a lot easer to get shampoo out of your liter bottle. Makes it very easy in the shower.</li>
    <li> The screw on part fit perfectly. They were a little long, but I would rather have them too long than too short. I just measured the bottle and cut the ends off. Simple fix. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with those GIANT Redkin shampoo/conditioner bottles. They fit well and work fine. No problems, here!</li>
    <li> These are great! No more pouring too much product. The pumps dispense just the right amount. For me, that&#x27;s three squirts of shampoo and one of conditioner. Plus, they fit my Redken liter bottles perfectly.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these pumps--one for me, and one for my daughter. She tried using it first and the pump would not work. I thought perhaps it was defective, so I gave her mine--same problem. I then took the pumps to figure out what the problem was and realized that the pump was a fraction too long for the bottle. I used a sharp knife to cut off less than 1/4 inch and it worked fine!</li>
    <li> It looks like others have had a tough time with these pumps which is too bad because mine were perfect. The tubes were not attached to the pump but WERE included and easy to put on. They were a gold color (not black, not clear). It was a little hard to get the pump to fit on the bottle but it&#x27;s because the shampoo and conditioner were thick and it was hard to get them in the right spot. But once I got it on both Redkin bottles (1L) they fit snug and absolutely perfect. They&#x27;re a good quality pump and I hope they&#x27;ll last through several bottles of shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Kejmepefornøyd, lett veldig etter disse og endelig fant jeg det hos dere :)&lt;br /&gt;Kjempe fornøyd kunde.&lt;br /&gt;Anbefaler dere på det sterkeste.</li>
    <li> Although it is not as well made as my previous pump it is certainly doing the job of pumping my Redken shampoo and I did not need to run store to store to find it.</li>
    <li> Great addition to large bottles of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Lousy pump and ugly color, not as pictured. Amazon will not allow me to warn you further. Read comments to find more info about reviews.</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> These pumps work fantastic in the shower.  The only problem I had is the one pump has a small crack in it from shipping I believe.</li>
    <li> I received my order quickly and it was as described.  I did get the white pump and it works great.</li>
    <li> Works and works again! What else can I say.</li>
