      <li>HOWEVER, it does not smell good to me at all.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous lift to go with the rest of the curls.  </li>
      <li>I have worked with my fairly curly hair for years trying to find something that helped to define the curl and held it without frizz.</li>
      <li>It makes no difference, this stuff does nothing good for my hair and the smell alone is reason to pass it by.</li>
      <li>This works great on fine curly hair - not sticky or crunchy!  </li>
      <li>I have been refreshing things with the lavender mist and have been extremely happy with the results--it has allowed me to go out with \\&quot;bed head\\&quot; since it revives things.</li>

      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did!</li>

      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much as it is kind of gummy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own review.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice hold that is pliable and never sticky.</li>
      <li>Great product and smells fresh too!</li>
      <li>Excellent natural product for taming curly hair.</li>
      <li>It loves most the Deva Curl line, but this stuff is amazing for my hair.</li>
      <li>If your hair is very fine and just wavy</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This product was incredibly pricy in my salon but more reasonable online.</li>
      <li>The smell is totally worth it though for the amazing curls I get from this product!</li>
      <li>Having said that, though, I absolutely LOVE the shampoo, conditioner and gel from Deva.</li>
      <li>Right\\&quot; spray and then dab a teeny bit more of this product, and my hair is set for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>:-))))</li>
      <li>I love this and the arc angell products by Deva.</li>
      <li>I use all the Deva products and love them!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It helps my curls to be more formed and defined.</li>
      <li>It makes it appropriately shiny and it holds well.  </li>
      <li>It kinda does, but it seems to change and get better after it goes on.</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo and the conditioner</li>
      <li>This set up and above styler is the best i&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
      <li>I LOVE DevaCurl.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a magic \\&quot;curl increaser.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and had great box etc.  </li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased to find I could get it $5 cheaper</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>If anybody has suggestions on how to use this better or maybe mix it with other DevaCurl products for best results, please share your technique.</li>
      <li>I do have a fair amount of hair and my hair is about 3 inches below my shoulders, just to give an idea of how much product I&#x27;m using.</li>
      <li>Good price and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Great product and received super fast</li>
      <li>I will agree with other reviews that this is not their best smelling product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a few years and every time I chop off my hair and buy way too many hair products to achieve that perfect look</li>
      <li>My hair is strong and stubborn and does not like to do what I tell it.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair with a light-to-medium curl.</li>
      <li>, some of which are super corkscrew and others that have relaxed a bit as my hormones have evened out (my curls were hormone induced when I hit puberty, imagine my surprise when I awoke one morning in the 5th grade with the equivalent of a toy poodle growing on my head!).</li>
      <li>This product is way too &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; for hair, but works well to smooth unruly edges.  </li>
      <li>: The reason it doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;amazon confirmed purchase\\&quot; is because this came as a part of a devacurl kit I purchased on Amazon.</li>
      <li>frizz free and helps them stay in place.  </li>
      <li>so I ordered a couple of them and got free shipping.  </li>
      <li>It really makes my hair more voluminous and I love the curl definition I have.  </li>
      <li>but when I use this product as described above your curls will turn out fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it - don&#x27;t use it daily because of the build-up, but it does exactly what I bought it for!</li>
      <li>Unlike most products, it gives natural curls without the crunch of most products.  </li>
      <li>The whole DevaCurl line has made me a loyal user forever!!</li>
      <li>Great on wet hair after leave-in conditioner or gel to boost curls in the winter.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair nice texture and it remains soft.</li>
      <li>I am on a constant search for a good product for my hair</li>
      <li>and I have a basket full of duds</li>
      <li>and she texted me that a female customer came in to where she works and told her she looks like a &amp;#34;wood nymph&amp;#34; with her gorgeous hair.</li>
      <li>so it must be worth using.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair that I mostly wear in an up-do.  </li>
      <li>Recipent was pleased and surprised.</li>
      <li>Another dime sized amount, flip head right side up, start from the roots and work my way up.</li>
      <li>I use it right after I&#x27;ve applied leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>so I guess I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get the right amount in my hair yet.</li>
      <li>I use this on top of DevaCurl AnGel just in the places that I need extra hold which is the sides of my hair.  </li>
      <li>sure that you open the package and look at the gel as soon as you get it to check for quality.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not good to flat-iron the hair, but on the rare occasion I do, this still adds great lift at the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Set Up and Above.  </li>
      <li>Interesting enough I had no idea what I was buying.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
      <li>This is also the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, people need to know.</li>
      <li>I love Set Up &amp; Above!  </li>
      <li>It does not smell as nice as the other Deva products, but doesn&#x27;t stink either.</li>
      <li>and I wish it were more natural, as I try to use all natural products.  </li>
      <li>I am willing to give this a chance cause I really want to like this.</li>
      <li>This product is strong enough to get my hair to separate and stand up on my head for a messy sheik, just got out of bed but going out on a hot date kind of look.  </li>
      <li>This is great to use on wet or dry hair.  </li>
      <li>If you have curly hair and need a little extra hold this product is great.  </li>
      <li>Really drying.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much to define your curls.</li>
      <li>Set it Free runs a close second.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was having terrible issues with frizzy hair.  I found DevaCurl (and use other products), and the natural ingredients cured my frizzy hairy!  My hair feels healthier and looks great!!!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried on my hair and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT! Deva Curl Set it Free runs a close second. Both weighed my hair down and made it looked dirty! It felt waxy to the touch and even made my fingers feel waxy if I touched my hair. I love the shampoo and the conditioner but this stuff is garbage and that is where it will end up.</li>
    <li> ladies, please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It&#x27;s gluey and sticky and builds up!  I will never waste my money on Devacurl products again.  It is not for mixed or black hair!</li>
    <li> I love Devacurl products and Set Me Up is just another great addition to the DevaCurl Line!  If you have curly hair and need a little extra hold this product is great.  I use this on top of DevaCurl AnGel just in the places that I need extra hold which is the sides of my hair.  It gives me all day maximum hold.  On day two when I take my hair down from the pineapple that has been put in place for sleeping I refresh my curls with a little Devacurl Mist-erRight and use Set Me Up, scrunch in and go!  Great product and smells fresh too!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have wavy/curly frizzy hair that decides to go straight in some spots . I use a dime size dollop and rub it in my hands and scrunch... Voila... Curls again!</li>
    <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product, the consistency itself is a bit weird, even when compared to similar products. I have short (chin length) curls, some of which are super corkscrew and others that have relaxed a bit as my hormones have evened out (my curls were hormone induced when I hit puberty, imagine my surprise when I awoke one morning in the 5th grade with the equivalent of a toy poodle growing on my head!). This product has helped to bring life to the relaxing curls and make things a little more even. I fully expected, based on the consistency to start, that it would be hard to wash off my hands and to get out of my hair, but neither was the case. I live in a hit humid environment and my summer hair consists of of a walking frizzy halo, but this has helped with that. I have been refreshing things with the lavender mist and have been extremely happy with the results--it has allowed me to go out with \\&quot;bed head\\&quot; since it revives things. This product was incredibly pricy in my salon but more reasonable online.</li>
    <li> I was using Deva Set Up &amp; Above (which is a pomade) before ordering it online.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ll use with my short do.  My hair is very thick and wavy.  This product holds my natural finger waves in place while keeping my hair soft and touchable (I can run my fingers through my hair).  I was pleased to find I could get it $5 cheaper online so I ordered a couple of them and got free shipping.  They came on time and just like what I get at the expensive beauty place in the mall.  I will be buying this product online from now on.</li>
    <li> Ordered for Christmas present. Sent in 2 shipments. Good price and fast delivery.Recipent was pleased and surprised.Interesting enough I had no idea what I was buying.It is a girl thing. Oh well!</li>
    <li> I have worked with my fairly curly hair for years trying to find something that helped to define the curl and held it without frizz. This product is incredible. I use it with the deva curl shampoo, conditioner, and gel as they recommend on their website for my type of curls. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and have recommended it to all my curly headed family and friends.</li>
    <li> I LOVE DevaCurl.  Me and my hair are addicted to the products!  I have been using Deva for a little over a year and highly recommend ALL curly girls to make the change to DEVA!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I will agree with other reviews that this is not their best smelling product.  However, it does not linger in hair at all.  A little goes a long way. It really makes my hair more voluminous and I love the curl definition I have.  I only use about a dime size amount, or less.  My hair is pretty thin and tends to lie flat, so this product is amazing for me.  Don&#x27;t let the smell put you off to it, because it dissipates.  Make sure you use a little, or I would imagine it might weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> Works the best of any product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair from looking all dried up.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT stuff!! Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I apply it to my hair before I get out of the shower. My hair shines and does not feel stiff when it dries.</li>
    <li> wow I not only love the smell of this product but it really works. My hair looks great and everyone says. whats on your hair it smells so great</li>
    <li> I read quite a few reviews before purchasing this product for my wavy hair. In retrospect, I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. I just don&#x27;t think that DevaCurl products work well for fine hair (or at least mine). This particular product, the \\&quot;curl set up\\&quot; is *so* thick and greasy. It exploded in its own packaging before it arrived and I had to use quite a bit of soap to get it off my hands. I already have trouble with my oily hair so adding more oil in the form of this product does not assist me. I think I&#x27;m just going to give up on DevaCurl and try to find another line of products that will help enhance my waves without making me a grease pit.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  Not what my thick, coarse, curly hair needed at all.  Made things worse.  Having said that, though, I absolutely LOVE the shampoo, conditioner and gel from Deva.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it does do what it says.  It is a tad sticky for my tastes, but not worth taking off a star.  I have thick wavy hair and use clips to add some lift while it dries.  However, naturally it tends to still droop at the top and lay flat as the day goes on.  I started using this just at the roots and wow! I put a little on my finger tips and just massage carefully (as to not give me frizz!) in certain areas at the scalp - wow! Gorgeous lift to go with the rest of the curls.  Personally, I don&#x27;t like it for the rest of my hair.  As I tried to scrunch it in, it just started to separate the curls and give me frizz.  I tried it when wet then and still doesn&#x27;t give me the look I like when mixing the UDG (UltraDefining Gel) and Styling Creme.  I like soft curls and this wasn&#x27;t giving it.  However, it is just awesome for the lift I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I KNOW...it&#x27;s not good to flat-iron the hair, but on the rare occasion I do, this still adds great lift at the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it - don&#x27;t use it daily because of the build-up, but it does exactly what I bought it for!</li>
    <li> excellent product fot thick curly hair-is thick and you have to really work it in but I love it.</li>
    <li> It smells strange and has too much stickiness to it.  I have to pre-condition my hair before putting it on or else it will turn my curly locks into a rat&#x27;s nest.  I expected more from a Deva Curl product.  Shipped fast and had great box etc.  Just the product itself was a let down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 3B in the curly hair scale.  I may be a dude, but I have fairly long hair for a guy (gotta flaunt the curls) and I need definition that can hold up all day.  This is the only product I use.  Unlike most products, it gives natural curls without the crunch of most products.  This product may seem expensive, but in the grand scheme of things, you get a natural look that the ladies (or, ahem, gentleman for you lady readers), love to run their hands through.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> This set up and above styler is the best i&#x27;ve used yet. I love this and the arc angell products by Deva.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair with a light-to-medium curl. I always look for ways to increase the curl. I&#x27;ve been using Deva Curl products for a while and really like them, but only recently started adding this to my regimen. I use gel in my hair fresh out of the shower, and then I use the Set Up &amp; Above after my hair starts to dry and is only damp. It&#x27;s like a magic \\&quot;curl increaser.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think those who find that it makes their hair waxy might be using far too much product.  It takes a very small amount even for my long hair. I rub a tiny dab into my palms and scrunch it in to my hair (with head hanging down). My hair dries very soft... far softer than it did before when I just finished with gel alone. In fact, it seems to take some of the crunch out of the gel without taking out the hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For second day, I spritz my hair with a teeny bit of water or the \\&quot;Mister Right\\&quot; spray and then dab a teeny bit more of this product, and my hair is set for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel it makes my hair stringy or waxy in any way when used conservatively. I really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: The reason it doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;amazon confirmed purchase\\&quot; is because this came as a part of a devacurl kit I purchased on Amazon. I just wanted to give this product it&#x27;s own review.</li>
    <li> This line of hair care products......the secret is use verrrrrrry little.....if I use too much t&lt;br /&gt;It makes ur hair yucky....:-))))</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that I mostly wear in an up-do.  Set Up and Above keeps your curls frizz free and helps them stay in place.  Its a little tacky, so I use very sparingly if you leave your hair down.</li>
    <li> This product made my 3b curls weighed down. There was no lift and body at all. Not what I expected. The smell was awful.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  I use on it slightly damp hair after using the deva curl shampoo, conditioner, and gel.</li>
    <li> This product works as far as its promise to give volume to hair. HOWEVER, it does not smell good to me at all. It is very sticky. It does NOT make your hair sticky when it dries but when you apply it, it&#x27;s very sticky. Not too bad if you apply it on the day you wash your hair as the water on your hair &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; with it. But for a second day hair, it just feels gross. I&#x27;m disappointed because this is the first product of this brand that I didn&#x27;t like very much. But it&#x27;s not so bad that I would throw it away (these things aren&#x27;t exactly cheap). Would probably use a little here and there until it&#x27;s all gone but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this again. :-(  P.S. If anybody has suggestions on how to use this better or maybe mix it with other DevaCurl products for best results, please share your technique. I am willing to give this a chance cause I really want to like this. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is way too &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; for hair, but works well to smooth unruly edges.  I also find the smell a little off-putting, but not completely offensive.  It does not smell as nice as the other Deva products, but doesn&#x27;t stink either.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of this cream/gel. It is a very creamy gel texture which gives a greasy pomade texture if you use too much. I&#x27;m use to gel so I guess I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get the right amount in my hair yet.</li>
    <li> I just started using this. I love it!!!! Gives my hair lots of body and really defined the curl. Don&#x27;t use too much as it is kind of gummy.</li>
    <li> I have curly long fine hair, type 3b, and use this product as a pomade when I have my hair in a ponytail or bun to keep the frizzies at bay and to add shine and definition. I am not a huge fan of the scent, but this product is moisturizing and washes out easily (even though I use a sulfate-free shampoo), and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This product is awful!  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the Devacurl products as well as many other hair care products and this has to be one of the worst.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair sticky and stringy looking- even after shaking it it out of my hair (after it dried) it still was crunchy and very sticky.  If you touch your hair the product leaves this paste on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair loves \\&quot;Set Up &amp; Above\\&quot;! It loves most the Deva Curl line, but this stuff is amazing for my hair. It makes it so curly! I could defiantly not live without this!</li>
    <li> Deva Concepts Curl is a great product. I have naturally wavy hair. I use it right after I&#x27;ve applied leave-in conditioner. It gives my hair nice texture and it remains soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t gunk up your hair, actually holds  the shape and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.  You have to use it with wet hair or it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> To use this product use your angel hair gel and let it DRY completely first.  Then take a SMALL amount (size of a dime) and rub it between your hands to make hands tacky then use hands to scrunch hair.  It will make your curls soft and shiny and bouncy.  I don&#x27;t know how the people who didn&#x27;t like it used it but when I use this product as described above your curls will turn out fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly, kinda frizzy, hair.  This product is the first one I found EVER that tames the frizz and keeps it that way all day long.  Just don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, and I love the line itself, but I don&#x27;t feel or see a difference when I put this on.</li>
    <li> Great on wet hair after leave-in conditioner or gel to boost curls in the winter. Only requires a small amount. Too much will weight hair down or make it look too greasy. Doesn&#x27;t hold up well in the summer/high humidity because the glycerin causes the hair to expand too much.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Really drying. An leaves a white film on hair when used within an hour.</li>
    <li> This provides a firmer hold to curls.  Works just like other gel products in the same line, but does provide additional hold.</li>
    <li> this stuff is pretty awesome I still have it and a lot goes a long way. I have naturally curlly hair so I just put a little on and it has a soft bounce</li>
    <li> I have dry curly hair and this product was recomended by a co-worker. I hate it!  It leaves my hair dry and corse.  I&#x27;m going to return it.  I am on a constant search for a good product for my hair and I have a basket full of duds, this is one of them now.  I also bought the Low Poo shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is dull &amp; dry.  This is also the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, people need to know.</li>
    <li> I love Set Up and Above.  This is a great product for people with curly hair.  I use all the Deva products and love them!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy hair and this product works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended applying this product after using the angel gel.  It gives a nice hold that is pliable and never sticky. I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
    <li> I love Set Up &amp; Above!  I use all Deva products and this one really keeps my ends from frizzing out.  I cleans, condition and then apply ArcAngGel to my wet hair.  Squeeze out the water and then use a large pea size of the Set Up &amp; Above to scrunch my wet curls into shape.  I use a little more if I need to diffuse my hair dry.  Can also be used after hair is completely dry to break up the gel cast that Deva is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you open the package and look at the gel as soon as you get it to check for quality.  I received one container that had turned brown and smelled badly - I think it was stored in the heat and went rancid.</li>
    <li> Awful product. The smell is HORRIBLE, and lingers on the hair. No matter how I use this product, it leaves my hair lank and frizzy, no curl definition, no shine, no lift. I&#x27;ve tried using a tiny dab, using it on wet hair, using it on dry hair, using it with other Deva products. It makes no difference, this stuff does nothing good for my hair and the smell alone is reason to pass it by.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! I have blonde curls, not frizzy...just loose ringlet type and I live in a super dry climate (Colorado) which means that my curls just don&#x27;t get the humidity they need. I read all the reviews (great stuff, horrible stuff, bad smell, not-so-bad smell, greasy, volumizing, etc.) and thought, well, I&#x27;d give it a shot. I am so glad I did! Does it have an unpleasant smell? It kinda does, but it seems to change and get better after it goes on. The smell is totally worth it though for the amazing curls I get from this product! My curls just get curlier and my hair is fuller. I go through my entire Deva process just like always and after my hair is dry I take a dime sized amount and rub it through my hands, then flip my head upside down and start from the roots and work my way up. Another dime sized amount, flip head right side up, start from the roots and work my way up. I do have a fair amount of hair and my hair is about 3 inches below my shoulders, just to give an idea of how much product I&#x27;m using. If your hair is very fine and just wavy this may not be the best product for you, but otherwise, try it ladies and get ready for the compliments about how great your hair looks! My 23 year old daughter whose hair is halfway to her waist just used it today for the first time and she texted me that a female customer came in to where she works and told her she looks like a &amp;#34;wood nymph&amp;#34; with her gorgeous hair. Don&#x27;t know what a wood nymph looks like, but apparently that&#x27;s a compliment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years and every time I chop off my hair and buy way too many hair products to achieve that perfect look I&#x27;m going for, I always go back to this product.  My hair is strong and stubborn and does not like to do what I tell it.  My hair is also dull and frizzy and thick. This product is strong enough to get my hair to separate and stand up on my head for a messy sheik, just got out of bed but going out on a hot date kind of look.  It makes it appropriately shiny and it holds well.  The smell is not great and I wish it were more natural, as I try to use all natural products.  So that is why it has lasted me so long - I only use it when I really feel the need to have complete control over my hair.  I recommend it for similar hair types and short thick hair styles.</li>
    <li> Great product and received super fast</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! A friend of mine who is a hairdresser reccommended this for my naturally curly. Works great and smooths the frizzies! :)</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and uses it all the time. I buy it for her often so it must be worth using.</li>
    <li> Excellent natural product for taming curly hair. It smells like orange peel and is so versatile. No more bad hair days!</li>
    <li> I have medium length wavy hair and need a little extra hold so I use this.  It helps my curls to be more formed and defined. If you use too much it makes hair greasy.  All you need is a tiny amount and it goes a long way.  I apply it to ends and scrunch up and it brings my curls to life.</li>
    <li> For my natural curls, this stuff is da&#x27; bomb!  Keeps my curls soft and manageable all day. The whole DevaCurl line has made me a loyal user forever!!</li>
    <li> This works great on fine curly hair - not sticky or crunchy!  You don&#x27;t need to use much to define your curls.</li>
    <li> This is great to use on wet or dry hair.  I like to apply it on the roots of dry hair with my fingertips to provide lift to my flat hair.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product for curly hair.  It really holds and defines the curls.</li>
