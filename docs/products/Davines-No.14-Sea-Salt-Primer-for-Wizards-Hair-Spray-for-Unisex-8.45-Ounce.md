      <li>Yes, the smell is amazing.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how amazing it is.  </li>
      <li>Also, as mentioned in the title of this review, it smells like cotton candy at the ocean, which is why I continue to buy this product instead of just making my own.</li>
      <li>My bf liked the smell he said it reminds him of the ocean</li>
      <li>It smells really good, kind of like vanilla which is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Not making it up, Davines printed it in their own brochure issued to salons.</li>
      <li>the money, make your own: Water, salt, conditioner, hair product.</li>
      <li>It also has a very light, nice fragrance that seems to dissipate</li>
      <li>I liked the results a lot better</li>
      <li>I have tried every sea salt spray out there and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Afterall, it was cheap, it smelled nice, and it gave amazing texture.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect weight/hold combination for hair that is fine yet naturally wavy.  </li>
      <li>Made my hair huge!</li>
      <li>It distracts me from the fact that it actually works WONDERFULLY.</li>
      <li>I really love this sea salt spray.</li>
      <li>It also smells better than the B &amp; B Surf Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This bottle sprays a lighter, more even mist than the B &amp; B Surf Spray bottle does.</li>
      <li>MagicaL product changed my life works lovely for beach wave texture.</li>
      <li>FABULOUS!</li>
      <li>I love this styling product.</li>
      <li>It gives my fine hair such wonderful body</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and leaves your hair nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>friend who is hair designer at Vidal Sassoon strongly recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have fine, oily hair</li>
      <li>I have fine lifeless hair</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for fine, limp hair, gives lift &amp; body.</li>
      <li>It may sound like a lot of work</li>
      <li>I like this product as it gives my fine hair more body-especially during hot, humid weather.  </li>
      <li>Decent recipes online that you can tailor to suit your own hair.</li>
      <li>No weird smell, and it does interesting things to my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great way to rescue unwashed hair when used with dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>The fine mist doesn&#x27;t drench your hair, which is good when you&#x27;re spraying it on dry hair.  </li>
      <li>It lasts all day to keep my hair full and styled.</li>
      <li>Davonte&#x27;s Sea Salt #14 is the best product I&#x27;ve found to \\&quot;coarsen\\&quot; my thin, baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>Smells soo fresh sweet vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My thought is it would give better results on hair that isn&#x27;t as long as mine and probably better results on layered hair.  </li>
      <li>This spray makes my hair exactly the texture I was looking for!</li>
      <li>I have very baby fine hair and bought this for texture.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite sea salt spray by far.</li>
      <li>Adds just a bit of texture/dryness for more natural looking curls.  </li>
      <li>and I really liked my hair for the next 1-2 days.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the investment.  </li>
      <li>If you have long hair that has a slight wave, the best results to get the wave look (with or without the product) is to twist very damp hair and twirl into a bun on top of your head ~ over night.  </li>
      <li>I like to use it right after I have curled a clients hair to add hold and texture.</li>
      <li>But, used in the right amount, will give your hair body and keep the oilies at bay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also currently got a bottle of the Hemp one (too sticky and the smell is too sweet) and the Aquage one (it&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>After my hair dries, I take out the hair ties, use a curling wand to touch up some of the curls/waves on the top sections, spray a few light mist of this product, and scrunch the curls/waves lightly with my hands.</li>
      <li>His hair looks great for fine thin hair.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used Davines No. 14</li>
      <li>My natural wave was enhanced about 10% more than normal.  </li>
      <li>this sea spray works wonders;)</li>
      <li>I was looking for something similar to Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray in a better price point.</li>
      <li>I sprayed on probably as much as the first time and combed it through.  </li>
      <li>What I love is that it sort of acts as a dry shampoo</li>
      <li>He will continue to use it as long as he wants some sexy comments.</li>
      <li>I used this over the summer when it was too humid to try to wear my hair straight.  </li>
      <li>but it really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I have straight hair, the spray and go technique</li>
      <li>I really recommend Davines wizard  </li>
      <li>and unfortunately it really doesn&#x27;t work and makes my hair look greasy.</li>
      <li>Works great for thin hair.</li>
      <li>It is good when you use it on wet hair, or almost like a hair spray on dry hair, It adds body.</li>
      <li>My hair is really fine and straight and it has absolutely no wave.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>The smell was fine ~ close to the vanilla as other reviews say</li>
      <li>I get compliments on my hair very frequently since I&#x27;ve started using this.  </li>
      <li>your significant other won&#x27;t stop smelling your hair.</li>
      <li>The second time I didn&#x27;t spray as much and it looked better but still not a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Kind of expensive, but the mist is so fine it seems like it will go a long way.  </li>
      <li>and then I recently found the ingredients list and to my horror saw that many of them were carcinogenic and extremely toxic!</li>
      <li>I have thick straight hair and this product seems like strong hairspray.</li>
      <li>This product is meant to add texture (someone said it made her hair feel dirty, its the beachy texture it provides, lol) and will also give you the ability to scrunch natural curly or wavy hair to look like you were born with beach waves.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d spray this in when my hair was damp and it would seal in my natural waves while preventing frizz...</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just smell sensitive?</li>
      <li>If you want natural looking volumized hair this is the product for you.</li>
      <li>It pieces up my hair without being sticky, adds texture while leaving it still soft to the touch.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a lot of thin hair and wear it long (middle of my back).  I have a slight natural wave if I let my hair air dry.  The first time I used Davines No. 14 as directed, I used too much and my hair looked and felt dirty in spots.  My natural wave was enhanced about 10% more than normal.  The second time I didn&#x27;t spray as much and it looked better but still not a huge difference.  The third time I used it,  I wringed out the excess water (didn&#x27;t towel dry) while still in the shower.  I sprayed on probably as much as the first time and combed it through.  I I put my hair up in the towel to remove excess water for about 10 minutes.  I liked the results a lot better ~the wave was probably about 25% more after this and my hair looked great.  Note:  If you have long hair that has a slight wave, the best results to get the wave look (with or without the product) is to twist very damp hair and twirl into a bun on top of your head ~ over night.  Another way is to towel dry and then use a soft plastic comb with wide teeth and comb through your hair every so often until it is dry.  It may sound like a lot of work but it really isn&#x27;t.  The smell was fine ~ close to the vanilla as other reviews say but it doesn&#x27;t linger.  My thought is it would give better results on hair that isn&#x27;t as long as mine and probably better results on layered hair.  I think the price is good for the amount you get.  It should last a very long time!</li>
    <li> This product is very sticky and heavy. I have thick straight hair and this product seems like strong hairspray. It dries very stiff and dry like hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;My best results were to spray product on my hands them grab the ends of my hair and let it go without any further combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, make your own: Water, salt, conditioner, hair product. Decent recipes online that you can tailor to suit your own hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product as it gives my fine hair more body-especially during hot, humid weather.  One note of caution...do not overuse. It will leave your hair feeling like a little haystack!  But, used in the right amount, will give your hair body and keep the oilies at bay.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My friend bought it &amp; I tried it. My hair never looked so good. Im into the beach look and this works perfectly. If you want natural looking volumized hair this is the product for you. Made my hair huge! I loved it!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this, and it helped keep my style for several days. It is good when you use it on wet hair, or almost like a hair spray on dry hair, It adds body. It has pleasant aroma, but it does not linger, which I like. I think it is about the best product of this kind that I have purchased for my hair, and I have tried many. My hair is thin and slightly curly. I really recommend Davines wizard  No. 14 Sea Salt Primer250mg.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sea salt spray by far. I used to use the John Frieda one (Ocean Waves) back in the day...and then I recently found the ingredients list and to my horror saw that many of them were carcinogenic and extremely toxic! No wonder they pulled it, even though ladies online still pine for it. Afterall, it was cheap, it smelled nice, and it gave amazing texture. But at what ultimate price? However, the Sea Salt Primer by Davines smells amazingly good. Still beachy but almost floral and not quite as suntan oil-like as the John Frieda. The texture it gives is great. I&#x27;ve also currently got a bottle of the Hemp one (too sticky and the smell is too sweet) and the Aquage one (it&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s got a bit of an unpleasant oily smell to it).  Davines is a bit pricey and hard to find locally, but I think it&#x27;s ultimately worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this and I really liked my hair for the next 1-2 days. So I decided on buying this for myself. It&#x27;s been sitting on my shelf for months and I&#x27;ve only used it 3-4 times. Only buy this if you know how to style your hair properly. It&#x27;s a waste of money if you buy this just to have it at home thinking you can recreate styles like your stylist!</li>
    <li> I love this styling product. I&#x27;m a male with thin/fine hair and this stuff gives me the texture, hold, and thickness that I need. I&#x27;m actually going to try it with the Davines Texture Spray as well, as they are supposed to go together well. Anyways, this is the best sea salt spray I have ever used period and I&#x27;ve tried literally tons. American Crew used to make a texture spray that is very similar to this stuff that was discontinued. I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a replacement until I found Davines. I hope Davines continues to make this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my more expensive Bumble &amp; Bumble Surf Spray. No weird smell, and it does interesting things to my hair. Basically the same thing.</li>
    <li> MagicaL product changed my life works lovely for beach wave texture. I have fine lifeless hair this sea spray works wonders;)</li>
    <li> Price is the same as cost.  Awesome beats getting one of my favorite products and not getting raped by mark ups!</li>
    <li> I have very baby fine hair and bought this for texture. Did as expected and would recommend to others with hair as mine. I usually spray some on damp hair and then a light mist once dry.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this for me.  I can&#x27;t believe how amazing it is.  It gives my fine hair such wonderful body and I can literally go for at least 2 days without a washing.  I used to have to wash every single day.  My hair routine is something like this:  shampoo, condition, spray this on hair, scrunch it through my hair and let it air dry.  Totally worth the investment.  I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll ever use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have fine, oily hair and I use this to give it a little body and a beachy crunch. It&#x27;s a great way to rescue unwashed hair when used with dry shampoo. Also, as mentioned in the title of this review, it smells like cotton candy at the ocean, which is why I continue to buy this product instead of just making my own.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this, I was a little put off by the fragrance. I investigated and learned that what I was smelling is vanilla. I’ve since grown used to it, discovering that the scent doesn’t stick around.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect product for my thick slightly wavy hair that does not like to be weighted down but still needs holding power.  I apply this when my hair is wet and use sparingly.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I used this over the summer when it was too humid to try to wear my hair straight.  I&#x27;d spray this in when my hair was damp and it would seal in my natural waves while preventing frizz...</li>
    <li> Adds just a bit of texture/dryness for more natural looking curls.  I have some body in my hair but this product truly brings out my waves. I get compliments on my hair very frequently since I&#x27;ve started using this.  I use it with bed head foxy curls and davines defining mousse.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing and leaves your hair nice and soft.  The best part is, it does not feel like you have any product in your hair. Do not use too much, or it may dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for fine, limp hair, gives lift &amp; body. No need for any gel, mousse etc any more !</li>
    <li> Great control for sun and wind. Smells like vanilla.Amazon is the best place to purchase- no running from store to store</li>
    <li> I had this product for over a year and only used it 3-4 times because I just don&#x27;t know when and how to use it.  I sprayed my hair with it before going to the beach and I got a tangled mess of semi waves that could not be uncombed which resulted in me having to wash my hair to remove the product.  I could not see myself using it on an everyday basis because it makes my hair look messy and I cannot do messy at work.  I just find this spray unnecessary for my lifestyle.</li>
    <li> This product has really good reviews and unfortunately it really doesn&#x27;t work and makes my hair look greasy. I love other Davines products and I was very disappointed about this one. Definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something similar to Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray in a better price point. This is it! It is cheaper and you get a lot of product. This bottle sprays a lighter, more even mist than the B &amp; B Surf Spray bottle does. It also smells better than the B &amp; B Surf Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product when I want to create texture waves. I have straight hair, the spray and go technique some of the other reviewer mentioned does not work on my hair. I spray all over my wet hair after washing, separate in a few sections, twist into buns, and secure with hair ties. After my hair dries, I take out the hair ties, use a curling wand to touch up some of the curls/waves on the top sections, spray a few light mist of this product, and scrunch the curls/waves lightly with my hands. I also finish with stronger hair spray when it is humid.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> This works well for my daughter . I think it makes your hair feel dirty and very expensive for the small bottle.  I will be giving it to my daughter!</li>
    <li> weak hold, leaves white residue, bad smell. could be a fake item. be extremely wary of buying products that is used on your person from any site that isn&#x27;t known for it.</li>
    <li> I really love this sea salt spray. It smells really good, kind of like vanilla which is my favorite. It works just like its supposed to.</li>
    <li> I think this product would probably work great if I had better hair! My hair is really fine and straight and it has absolutely no wave. This stuff is made for people with a little texture in their hair already.</li>
    <li> Smells soo fresh sweet vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend who is hair designer at Vidal Sassoon strongly recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know why she did!!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect weight/hold combination for hair that is fine yet naturally wavy.  It adds texture and volume when applied to damp or dry hair.  I have tried every sea salt spray out there and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Recommend by my hair stylist. It helps me to manage the same as professional and keep all day long with vanilla smell.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, loose, curly hair.  I use this sea salt spray on both wet and dry hair as a styling aid and it produces tighter, fluffier (more body) curls for me that aren&#x27;t shiny (nothing wrong w/shiny, but beachy curls are matte, I guess).  On two-day old hair I&#x27;ve already used this wet (first day) and dry (second day as a curl refresh) and it didn&#x27;t get too sticky (like some other brands that left my hair feeling like I used regular hair spray).  It also has a very light, nice fragrance that seems to dissipate so I could see this as a uni-sex styling aid.  The fine mist doesn&#x27;t drench your hair, which is good when you&#x27;re spraying it on dry hair.  Kind of expensive, but the mist is so fine it seems like it will go a long way.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband.  He has fine thin hair.  When we go to the beach his hair always looks great so I thought hmmmm what if I buy some beach for his hair?  Guess what, it worked.  His hair looks great for fine thin hair.  I would recommend this product.  He will continue to use it as long as he wants some sexy comments.</li>
    <li> Listen up, Glamazons! I&#x27;m here to give you the 411 on this product. One word.....FABULOUS! IF you know how to use it. This product is meant to add texture (someone said it made her hair feel dirty, its the beachy texture it provides, lol) and will also give you the ability to scrunch natural curly or wavy hair to look like you were born with beach waves. Yes, the smell is amazing. It smells like a cupcake almost. Use on wet or dry hair. I like to use it right after I have curled a clients hair to add hold and texture. BTW, Justin Beiber uses this product. Not making it up, Davines printed it in their own brochure issued to salons. Not that that should matter. I wouldn&#x27;t have mentioned his name, but, he actually uses it. Nothing more annoying than a celebrity that endorses products they don&#x27;t even use. ex: Pantene. This product is worth every penny, it should last at least 3 months if you use it every day. Word of caution....your significant other won&#x27;t stop smelling your hair. giggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxox&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used for my hair, and it smells great too! Perfect for the beachy wave look.</li>
    <li> Addicted to this stuff. What I love is that it sort of acts as a dry shampoo so if my hair is greasy at the end of the day, a few spritzes completely refresh my style. The bottle lasts forever so don&#x27;t be put off by the price.</li>
    <li> Davonte&#x27;s Sea Salt #14 is the best product I&#x27;ve found to \\&quot;coarsen\\&quot; my thin, baby fine hair. I use it in place of mousse or styling gel. It lasts all day to keep my hair full and styled.</li>
    <li> My partner seems to think this smells like \\&quot;generic girl product\\&quot; but the smell is actually kinda sweetly sickening. Like... slightly souring cake frosting. It distracts me from the fact that it actually works WONDERFULLY. It pieces up my hair without being sticky, adds texture while leaving it still soft to the touch. Maybe I&#x27;m just smell sensitive?</li>
    <li> This spray makes my hair exactly the texture I was looking for! Works great for thin hair. Smells like vanilla cake but fades soon after. Quality stuff!</li>
    <li> I tried this after reading the reviews, even though I thought it was a bit expensive..My hair is thin and stubborn with NO BODY or texture at all..I put this on my dry hair and it made it piecey and gave it some volume..Be careful and don&#x27;t spray too much your hair will get sticky and clump together..I didn&#x27;t think the product smelled like vanilla or cupcake AT ALL...It smelled weird to me but the scent does not linger...My bf liked the smell he said it reminds him of the ocean</li>
