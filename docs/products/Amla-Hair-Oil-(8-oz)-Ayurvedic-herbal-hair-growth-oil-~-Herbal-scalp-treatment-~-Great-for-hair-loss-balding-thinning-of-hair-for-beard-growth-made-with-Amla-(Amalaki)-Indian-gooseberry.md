      <li>Both my daughter and I have noticed amazing repair of damage to hair along with faster growth.  </li>
      <li>I think this is an effective product.</li>
      <li>It strengthens the hair giving it body and a nice luster.  </li>
      <li>somewhat musky not too nice but not horrid either.</li>

      <li>This product is very good without any additives and the price is right too.  </li>
      <li>Most hair oils make my fine hair look creasy, this oil absorbs wonderfully so my hair feels so light.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and in great condition.  </li>
      <li>This product has a very strong smell.</li>
      <li>I have found that other distributors add fillers and chemicals to a naturally wonderful hair oil, and these additives greatly reduce the benefits from the amla oil.</li>
      <li>This oil is by far the best hair conditioner I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>but Amla oil is the best i&#x27;ve used so far .</li>
      <li>I add it into my growth aid and it gives me new growth and incredible shine</li>
      <li>I love this oil</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it does not contain mineral oil.</li>
      <li>It seems to make the hair stronger, more manageable and mositurized.</li>
      <li>my hair seems healthier and more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>this point, i just love the fact that my hair looks thicker than it ever did before.</li>

      <li>and I love how this makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of the hair oil.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for more than a month now</li>
      <li>Then I apply more to the ends, working the oil all through her hair.  </li>
      <li>Vadik Herbs oils also cured my dandruff which I had for many years.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>The smell is overwhelming</li>
      <li>My hair is also shinier and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>I love this oil.</li>
      <li>and it had an overwhelming smell and was a greenish/blue color -</li>
      <li>Please Vadik Herbs make a fragrance free Amla oil!</li>
      <li>My hair is still thanking me:)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cheers  :-)</li>
      <li>However, Argon oil is a better option.</li>
      <li>immediately my hair looks shinier and more healthy....</li>
      <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it</li>
      <li>My dreads are softer and feel better to the touch.</li>
      <li>I will be using this with coconut oil to get more benefits.</li>
      <li>I wanted a product that would help my hair to look shiny and healthy plus help with growing out my hair to a longer length....</li>
      <li>I love Jojoba , castor , avacado and olive oil</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this oil.</li>
      <li>Always good for Amla oil to contain Amla, right?  </li>
      <li>Great high quality product.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware it&#x27;s good for hair.  </li>
      <li>Love it so far  smells great in my opinion</li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth and healthy.</li>
      <li>I am a natural freak and amla oil is just great for moisturizing and conditioner your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Washes out easy and does not leave hair oily.  </li>
      <li>Nothing too strong.</li>
      <li>I was concerned that the smell of this oil would be too strong</li>
      <li>It woks just fine.</li>
      <li>I think this is the perfect oil for black women .</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I am still not a fan of the smell, it is more then tolerable with the results I&#x27;ve experienced, and I would recommend this product to anyone who has issues with dry hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great, smells like peanuts. I don&#x27;t mind it, but you might.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying Amla Hair Oil twice a week for the past 3-4 weeks, leaving it in my hair for 2-3 hours at a time.  I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference in the length of my hair.  I haven&#x27;t noticed the strengthening or protection from falling out as much, but I think with time that too will come.  So far, so good.  The smell is strong, but it&#x27;s not terrible, at the same time, I would not go out with the oil in my hair.</li>
    <li> Seriously I didn&#x27;t see any results. Don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
    <li> Great for growth. Also purchase with alma powder to ingest as well. Great results!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I got it in yesterday and I have a special hair care routine that I do, but I was so anxious to try this product that I just had to try it anyway. I put the oil all over my head, massaged it into my scalp, and let it sit for 2 hours. Then I took a shower and washed it all out. When I was done taking a shower I let my hair air dry and it was so soft and silky. It felt like I blow dried my hair. Once my hair was completely dry I took a little bit, not too much, and put it on my ends and on my body of my hair (not the scalp). My hair was instantly shiny. Warning: don&#x27;t put too much because your hair will look dirty and greasy. As for today, before school I put some on my ends again and I love how this makes my hair feel. I will absolutely order this again once I run out. I shower every 2nd day because it is not healthy to shower every day, and from now on I am going to put this in my hair for a couple hours before I shower. On other reviews I read about the smell, I personally don&#x27;t mind it because it reminds me of being a little girl. Let me say that it is a little strong and may take some time to get use to. I think that getting this product is worth getting because you can just mask the smell with some leave in conditioner or something. I recommend this product for people with dry hair that needs some moisture.</li>
    <li> I bought two of Bazaar of India&#x27;s Brahmi-Amla Oil and the Amla Oil which are both good for hair application. I use both these oils in separate application since the Amla Oil which has a recommended 8-hour application. Both these oils are mineral-oil free and in most of the other user reviews you would read about the scent of the oils, however, this is a very minor issue unless you plan to walk around all day and have people sniffing your hair/head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last a while since the required application, for your hair, is a small amount to coat your hair and massage your scalp and should be left in for eight (8) hours after which you can wash out. The benefits of the oil is great and keeps your hair soft, shiny and tangle free for as long as you leave it in. Definitely a recommended buy.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have been looking for.  The price was good and it was not diluded.  It came fast and I was happy I found it on amazon.  I would recommend this to any one looking for it.</li>
    <li> I have heard a lot of great things about amla hair oil, so I bought some from other distributors. I have found that other distributors add fillers and chemicals to a naturally wonderful hair oil, and these additives greatly reduce the benefits from the amla oil. I love this product because it is natural and organic with no fillers like mineral oil. It strengthens the hair and make it soft and lovely.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the TRUTH! I have locs and this product moisturizes and gives a beautiful sheen. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The headline just means that this did nothing for my hair other than give it an interesting smell. Save you money.</li>
    <li> I give this product an A+, I mix this with Hesh Shikakai Hair Oil and it a great combination, it works wonders. Thanks Amazon for such great products. My hair is still thanking me:)</li>
    <li> I heard about amla oil quite a while ago and finally decided to try it.  You need only a little bit to give your hair a beautiful sheen. My hair has a tendency to be frizzy and this oil takes care of it.  Amla oil is very high in vitamin C so it is great for the skin.  I like to put it on my face for clear, smooth complexion.  The oil is not heavy and it soaks in really well.  This product is very good without any additives and the price is right too.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for my hot oil treatments and henna mixtures. I occasionally massage it into my temples too. It woks just fine. It helps keep my hair soft. I&#x27;m glad it does not contain mineral oil.</li>
    <li> Stripped my hair of color.  I bought this to help make my (black) hair darker and instead it started to turn light brown / yellowish.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m in the minority here but I actually really like the smell of this! After reading all the negative comments about the fragrance I was quite surprised when I opened the bottle. It has a familiar scent - I can&#x27;t pin point it but it reminds me of something. I like it!  The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed. Did any body receive their bottle with a seal (under the cap?)  I do like this in my hair but be careful, a little goes a LONG way. This bottle will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong smell.I don,t usually like fragrance products.I like it coz it has no mineral oil.Its making my hair stronger no spilt end.My hair is also growing.I mix it with bringhay.Other than the smell its a good product and does what it says.Somehow u get used to it.Please Vadik Herbs make a fragrance free Amla oil! that could be great!The price is good too!I gave it a 4 star for the smell    UPDATE!  So i was using this oil to oil my scalp when i was in braids.I just took my braids out.There is no shedding breakage and my hair has darken naturally strong and grown like crazy!It,s also soft and shiny and detangles easily.Other than the smell which i will be taming down with other oils its a great product.Am  odering the big Bottle.Am so pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I like the product fine enough, st least what was left in the bottle.  The seal was broken and oil leaked into the package and my mailbox box.</li>
    <li> The first bottle was an A1 product.  I especially loved the smell which helped me sleep.  I got the red label one this time &amp; it doesn&#x27;t come out green or have the smell I loved so much.  Why do they always change something that&#x27;s good?  I&#x27;ll use it because it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning it, but I no longer will buy this brand.</li>
    <li> Just received the oil, first thing I did was check the ingrediants. it has sesame oil Alma and long pepper or (piper longum)nothing else but a little fragrance. I used it to prepoo and it helped make my hair soft...but I will update you later on rather it worked to improve scalp and hair condition after I try enough aplications and give it a chance to work. I am using it on my granddaughters cradle cap too.</li>
    <li> I am a natural freak and amla oil is just great for moisturizing and conditioner your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like ylang ylang oil but less expensive than ylang ylang.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a new bottle of this stuff (same brand) and it is NOT the same as it was the last time I bought it.  The last time I bought this (about 4 years ago), it was pure amla oil and it had an overwhelming smell and was a greenish/blue color - that was how you knew it was real.  They have changed the ingredients however and now it&#x27;s clear and basically just sesame seed oil!  In fact, sesame seed oil is the first ingredient listed on the ingredients label.  I will never buy this brand again.  This new formula does not help with hair growth and does not darken hair like the original formula did.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Keeps my scalp and hair moisturized without feeling greasy. I mix it with jojoba oil, and my hair loves it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great high quality product. Be aware this oil does not have a fragrance. It smells like the natural ingredients in it, most notably sesame seed and mustard seed oil. A minor inconvenience for the fact that it actually works.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would help my daughter&#x27;s hair as she has some problem with her edges which are very delicate and fall out easily. This wasn&#x27;t my first choice to buy, there was another product out there with better reviews but since it was unavailable at the time, i decided to give this a try and I am not disappointed. My daughters edges grew iback in and even thickened some. It also keeps her hair well conditioned and protected. Overall, her hair is just more manageble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use some on myself too. I have dreads but it&#x27;s hard to find a product that works well with my hair in keeping it conditioned without a lot of build up and I like this product. My dreads are softer and feel better to the touch. I definately reccommend it for anybody to use.</li>
    <li> Hi, this product is very good. It helped my hair grow and I noticed a difference after only the first application. However, it&#x27;s made my hair very dry, and since I already have pretty dry hair this is not an oil I can continue using so I will give coconut oil a try instead.</li>
    <li> Makes hair shinier &amp; isnt excessively oily. does have strong smell, not bad-smells similar to Bio oil, but stronger. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> No question but Amla is a wonderfully nutritious hair enhancer.  I have been using it for more than a month now and it is well worth the price.  Use it sparingly and it is quickly absorbed by the scalp.  It strengthens the hair giving it body and a nice luster.  Another gem from India!</li>
    <li> this is a great hair oil and works as it says it does. I would recommend this brand because it does not have the mineral oil in it, just be aware that the smell is a lil...different. I only use it in deep conditioning and a spritz but I def. tone it down for the spritz, but it works!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for almost 2 years and it has made my&lt;br /&gt;hair super strong and it has helped me tremendously with my dry&lt;br /&gt;scalp.  An excellent oil! :)</li>
    <li> I have yet to see any difference (meaning growth) in my hair. I really hate the fact that I can&#x27;t just leave it in my hair. Some people said the smell was unpleasant, but  I find the scent to be just fine.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it, but I really wish I could leave it in my hair. I&#x27;m an African American woman and we normally don&#x27;t wash our hair everyday or every other day</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the smell so I was preparing myself for the worst and to be honest I really dont know what the fuss is about!  I have natural Afro hair and my hair is now so soft and manageable. What I like the most I can see my natural curl come through. Can&#x27;t give this enough stars! Far better then Dabur amla which contains mineral oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using once a week. Have not seen any major changes in my hair length,thickness,grays or over all appearance but I&#x27;m going to keep on using as a pre-shampoo treatment the note before my wash day and see if continued use over a longer period of time provides improvement. Its only been about 3 weeks. Leaves my hair greasy after I wash it out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use conditioner on my hair because it weighs it down, so i relay on this product to condition and protect my hair during blow drying. Little goes a long way and with this oil less is more. I put a bit on my palm and comb it through my hair using a wide tooth wooden comb. It smells lovely and makes my hair super soft and shiny without weighing my hair down. Most hair oils make my fine hair look creasy, this oil absorbs wonderfully so my hair feels so light. I recommend this oil, next time i would like to try Brahmi-Amla Hair Oil</li>
    <li> I just received the Amla Oil in the mail today and was looking forward to trying it. I immediately looked at the ingredients listed on the bottle and they are,in this order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural sesasme seed oil&lt;br /&gt;Ayurvedic emblica officinalis (Indian Gooseberry / Amla)&lt;br /&gt;Piper Longum&lt;br /&gt;Tinospora Cordifolia&lt;br /&gt;Natural fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the sesame seed oil. I wasn&#x27;t aware it&#x27;s good for hair.  I Googled it and did find that sesame seed oil is, in fact, good for hair. I also learned that it has hair darkening capabilities.  I recall reading in some of the reviews for this product, that it has darkened the hair of some users.  I also Googled emblica officinalis and learned its the offinal name for Amla. Was happy to learned that.  Always good for Amla oil to contain Amla, right?  Then I Googled Piper Longum and Tinospora Cordifolia and I&#x27;m wondering why these two ingredients are included. I didn&#x27;t find anything that suggested they are good for hair or helps hair grow. They are good for many  other things like Diarrhea, gonorrhea, syphllis, etc...things you woulndn&#x27;t think would be synonymous with hair growth. Maybe Bazaar India (the importer of this product) could explain that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give it a try and see if there&#x27;s a difference in my hair by the time I finish the bottle.  If there&#x27;s no difference, oh well.  Didn&#x27;t cost much to try and I won&#x27;t be buying again. For now, I give it three stars because of how it made my hair feel...very soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> about the seller: I got my product relatively fast and the shipping/packaging was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for the first time and had heard about the smell so I mixed it (50/50) with extra virgin coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;First off: WOW. I used it to oil my scalp and then ran some through the ends. it instantly softened my hair. it is 3 days later and my hair is still ultra shiny and lustrous looking. People say it does darken your hair over time, but I wonder if the darkening effect is really just the oil makes your hair look so dense lustrous etc.&lt;br /&gt;warning: a little goes a LONG way. the first day I applied it like I usually applied my oils. entirely too much. oil was dripping down my neck all night. But actually for the price I think this is great because I won&#x27;t run out too quickly. In addition the smell is quite off-putting so the fact that it only takes a few drops is great because too much more and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it so be warned if you have a sensitive nose. just thought I&#x27;d give my initial review.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil. I think this is the perfect oil for black women . My hair is much softer and healthier . I saw the difference in my hair in a matter of days after using this product . I love Jojoba , castor , avacado and olive oil but Amla oil is the best i&#x27;ve used so far . It&#x27;s really worth the buy . Just try it , if you don&#x27;t like it you can always switch to something else . Oh did i mention that my hair is starting to grow again after being stagnant for sometime :)</li>
    <li> I have been researching natural hair re growth products and so far I am finding my own regimen. I just ordered this product yesterday afternoon and I received it today! Super fast delivery.  The bottle came in a bubble package and was wrapped in a plastic bag. I opened the bottle cap and there is a protection seal on it. Someone had mentioned theirs didn&#x27;t have one but mine did. I will be using this with coconut oil to get more benefits. I really hope this works for hair regrowth and help fight dry scalp. The scent has a slight warm nut/seed scent to it. Nothing too strong. I cannot review for hair results yet. Will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I have not used it. Purchased for my niece. She says it&#x27;s a good product, improves hair thickness and texture. However, Argon oil is a better option.</li>
    <li> i purchased this after reading  recipe for a hair mask in one of my natural health magazines.  the recipe called for coconut oil, honey, neem oil, and amla oil.  i did not have the amla for a while and used the other three ingredie ts.  i gave up the neem quickly, as it smelled horrible.  the coconut and honey mix was good and i saw an improvement in my hair.  however, it was the addition of the amla that changed everything.  my hair is full and shiny.  it feels so much healthier.  even my colorist commented on how well i take care of the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this sporadically. It has a slight smell, but not unpleasant and it fades. I&#x27;ve used it as an overnight oil treatment, and I think it nourished my hair. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s grown faster, but I haven&#x27;t been diligent with it. I like using it on my hands as well. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Tried this for my thinning hair. Don&#x27;t know what the benefits are but I did not notice any improvement after using the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> It is true that since I purchased this product along with my Goody Copper Bristled Brush my hair quit falling out as much.  I do still loose hair when I brush and in the shower, but not nearly as much!  I am now only loosing about 1/8 the amount of hair I was loosing before purchasing these products.  Use as directed and invest on a Good brush (I recommend GOODY Copper bristle brush) and you will notice a difference!  Worth every penny!  Arrived quickly and in great condition.  Great Company Vadik Herbs!  and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Amla Hair Oil for 1 month now.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is shedding so much less now.  Before I started using the oil, I would have to clean up hair from all over my bathroom floor after combing. My hair is also shinier and more manageable.  It does smell like licorice to me, but I can deal with that if it means stronger, healthier hair.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that the smell of this oil would be too strong but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the Indian hair oil I was using.  My daughter (who is 17yoa)  has long, thick, bleached hair that breaks off easy and very damaged from bleaching.  I mix Amia Hair Oil with Coconut Oil  (1/4 Amia Hair Oil 3/4 Coconut oil).  Heat in microwave for about 1.5 minutes so it melts and is warm.  Then I apply to my daughter&#x27;s hair with a children&#x27;s  medicine dropper.  Start at the front of her head applying to the scalp massaging the scalp for about 5 minutes.  Then I apply more to the ends, working the oil all through her hair.  Leave&#x27;s it in for at least an hour or sometime overnight.  It has worked wonders on her hair.  Washes out easy and does not leave hair oily.  We have her hair trimmed to cut off split ends every six weeks.  After 4 weeks of using the oil 2-3 times a week, she had no split ends.  Our hairdresser was amazed!  She excepted to have to trim at least 1/4&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t even touch her hair with the scissors.  My daughter only washes her hair 2-3 times a week but uses heat every day to style it.  I have very fine, thin, straight,  shoulder length bleached hair I only use it 1 time every couple of weeks.  Both my daughter and I have noticed amazing repair of damage to hair along with faster growth.  For us the smell is not noticeable when mixed with coconut oil.  Even just by itself, it&#x27;s NOTHING compared to the Indian Oil we were using and the results are far greater then anything else we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have noticed after using this oil for a month that my hair is not as dry as it used to be.  I am African American with natural hair and this will be a staple in my arsenal to fight dryness and frizzies!!!  You must give this a try.  Oh, the smell is not bad at all in my opinion.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I purchased some hair products that claimed to have Amla oil .  When I read the label I found that Amla oil was the very last ingredient.  I decided to purchase  some Amla oil to supplement my conditioners.  I have only used it once but I like the way my hair feels now.  I am not entirely sure it was simply due to the Amla oil.  I had also started using wheat germ oil in my hair and it too made my hair shine and feel like it used to feel when I was younger.  I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Will use this product till the day I die or it&#x27;s no longer made. GREAT for naturals. No build up just aids in helping you grow beautiful hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;However, I would only purchase Amla Oil from Vadik Herbs. I bought the what I thoought was 100% Amla Oil from other manufacturers and it seemed liek a totally different product! Vadik Herbs sells the real deal, IMO.</li>
    <li> this product has changed, and it  dosent work the same, just a FYI, i&#x27;ll be making my own from now on!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Smells horrible but I use as directed.  Put on overnight or hours before shampooing and have new hair growth in the one month since I started using along with Amla capsules.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that would help my hair to look shiny and healthy plus help with growing out my hair to a longer length....this product has performed all three.....I place a dime size or a little larger amount of oil to the palm of my hand, then rub my palms together and rub the AMLA oil into my hair...immediately my hair looks shinier and more healthy....a little AMLA oil goes a long way...I do use it everyday.  I find that it does not flatten your hair style like some other products that have been used in the past...the oil does have a somewhat heavier sweet smell that lingers for a while, it also has a greenish cast to the oil,however,I do have blond hair and have not noticed that the color of the oil changed my color in anyway.  I compared other products with Indian Gooseberry oil as an ingredient and found this product to be more reasonable.</li>
    <li> This Alma oil  is the truth, used this in me and my daughters hair, it helped growing our edges, pleasant  smell</li>
    <li> Works well in oil mixture for natural hair.</li>
    <li> The smell is overwhelming but I still tried to use it for well over a month but I didn&#x27;t see any changes it weighs down ur hair if u don&#x27;t wash it out even the smallest amount which I definitely used small amounts due to the smell</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair oil for over 2 months. I love the smell of the hair oil. It is good to know there are no synthetic oils in the product. Amla is really good for hair.  This oil leaves my hair soft and smooth. I usually apply oil in the night before I go to sleep and  wash it in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product came at a low price and it arrived ahead of schedule which is a win-win for me! Great product and great service! Item was as listed/pictured! I will buy from this merchant again and I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing, it definitely adds to my hair health regime and is my beauty secret passed on from indian tradition. My hair is thicker, longer, and shinier!! I totally recommend that every woman add this to their routine!!!</li>
    <li> My hair seems thicker since using this item and I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this product made my hair grow but it definitely made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 2 months, didn&#x27;t see results until after 3-4 weeks or notice a change. I would wash my hair or place hair gel into my scalp before I used the product and I would find several lose hairs. 2 months later my hair is thicker and it seemed to fill in more. Now i wash hair gel out of my hair and maybe find 1 or 2 lose hairs when before I would find several.</li>
    <li> I didnt notice much difference in my hair loss with this product. I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I gave this Amla Hair Oil four stars, since I have just started using it, and cant give it five stars at the moment, So far, I am satisfied with the feel of my hair when I apply AMLA HAIR OIL.  waiting to see its direct effect in the near future as described by other users. So far so good I must say.</li>
    <li> I really like this Amla oil it makes my hair feel nice &amp; looks very healthy I will buy more!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil after reading some great reviews in a natural hair group on Face Book, but was disappointed by the smell and the fact that it left my hair feeling very, very greasy when I used it with water as a regular moisturizer, and stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it another chance after seeing some reviews on YouTube.  I sprayed water on my hair first, then sectioned, detangled, and applied the oil as a deep conditioning/pre-poo treatment, racking it through each section with my fingers before putting my hair into a shower cap over night.  In the morning, the first thing I noticed was that my hair didn&#x27;t feel at all greasy, as my hair had absorbed the oil.  After I washed my hair, I noticed that for the first time since my hair has been natural, my edges felt soft and were no longer crunchy feeling, and my ends were soft, smooth and less frizzy.  The softness lasted for three full days, which is a miracle for me, and I am hopeful my hair will continue to improve with repeated usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am still not a fan of the smell, it is more then tolerable with the results I&#x27;ve experienced, and I would recommend this product to anyone who has issues with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks; since the 2nd week of January 2015.  The crown of my hair almost smooth as a babies behind; I now see growth and the texture of my hair is softer.  It&#x27;s not dry and brittle anymore!&lt;br /&gt;I love the product. It is really making a difference.  It may be a slow process; but it took a long time for me to lose my hair...But to God Be All The Glory, it&#x27;s growing back!  (He made the fruit after all - the  Gooseberry)</li>
    <li> this was purchased for my wife so i really don&#x27;t have a lot to say either way about this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for 3 months and it is great for conditioning, as are all three other hair oils from this supplier that I had used over the course of the last 14 months.  Vadik Herbs oils also cured my dandruff which I had for many years.  I used all oils overnight 1-3 times per week, washed out in the morning with ayurvedic herbs.  5 months ago I started experiencing heavy hair loss which I thought may be due to the sesame oil (I was using Bhringraj oil in sesame base at the time).  I don&#x27;t think so any longer, it&#x27;s just that oils help pull out weaker hair, the reason for hair loss is different.  In my case, it is likely hypervitaminosis A.  I stopped taking vit A nearly 2 months ago, still experience heavy hair loss though.  I am switching to castor oil now, hopefully it will help stop my hair loss and I will be able to go back to Vadik Herbs products.</li>
    <li> I really like the oil, but the bottle was broken. It also smells a lot better than other Alma oils I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;The oil had leaked out on the papers and I lost a considerable amount of the product.</li>
    <li> I just received this product the other day.  I washed my hair and used this product on my scalp.  My hair is super soft and conditioned very well.  I will continue to use this product.  It is great!!!!!</li>
    <li> If your looking for an organic hair oil with all the harsh chemicals in it. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Found this product to be as good as advertised. Not too oily or too smely which is a far better product than what I used before. Dries quickly and leaves your hair and scalp soft and nourished. Ingridient list is not long and does not have what is not supposed to be there only what you need. Would definetly recommend this product and the money will be well spent.</li>
    <li> Terrible buy many professional hair products this product I did not do what it claimed</li>
    <li> I love this oil I add it in to my henna... I add it into my growth aid and it gives me new growth and incredible shine but the smell is horrible and it stays for days.. I usually try to mask the smell with a another oil that helps! Also only use a little because it can get heavy</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It really has helped making my hair soft. I use this in combo with flaxseed oil and coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This product receives four stars for two reasons. First, it is not 100% pure amla oil. There are at least two other ingredients besides the amla. Second, the smell is natural and not pleasing to me at all however it does dissipate after five minutes. I think this is an effective product. I use it on my hair. I&#x27;ve been using the oil for about a month or so. My hair is curly. When I use the oil, my curls are well defined and there is no frizz. The grey hair at the front top of my forehead is less noticeable (I don&#x27;t know how that is even possible). When I forget to use the oil, my curls notice.</li>
    <li> This oil delivers on its promises. It&#x27;s a great conditioner for both scalp and hair.  It&#x27;s very thick. I can only use it before going to bed, as it appears too greasy on my hair to wear when styled. However, when your hair feels dry during the day, a few drops of this rubbed in while leave your hair feeling nourished.</li>
    <li> Going by all the hype, I expected more. It&#x27;s not bad, the odor is pleasant but it will not really make white hair dark.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money and if it were cost effective to have returned it, I would have. It has all kinds of other oils in it that I&#x27;d never put in my hair..and for good reason too, as it turns out that it makes my hair feel quite awful and doesn&#x27;t do as it purports for the hair. Would never buy again.</li>
    <li> I need new bottle..the package was loose and damaged..with oil coatings on the outer layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer pls consider the above and respond to fly4rahul@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have 4A hair, low porosity and needed something to help keep my hair healthy and moist. This product didn&#x27;t do that for me, it just sat on my hair, HOWEVER, it worked wonders for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just so happened to be at my wits end with my acne and needed a good moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate it further. Since I wasn&#x27;t going to be using this product on my hair anymore, i decided that I really had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week my acne was considerably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, was taking aczone and differn for four months, and was not happy. I used this oil by itself without the acne meds and was shocked at the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have oily skin and are skeptical, just remember like dissolves like. Google sesame oil benefits on acne to see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers  :-)</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail today. The smell of it is sort of like anise and somewhat musky not too nice but not horrid either. Aside from that it does a nice job of softening my 4b/c hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel of it enough to try adding some essential oils to it to try and cover up the smell a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Worth giving a try. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> im sure its useful, but i have only used it once so i cant give feedback just yet. i gave it 4 stars because the bottle keeps leaking. every time i clean it i find it still leaks i cant find where from exactly, i would recommend choosing a better quality for the bottles, specially that i had it shipped to the UAE</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, I am sure the product is good because I gave it to my sister and she uses it with no problems.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bottle of Amla oil six months ago because I&#x27;ve been experiencing hair mild hair loss (feels worse than that, but I have to objectively say it&#x27;s mild, mostly around my temples) for a little over a year now.  I&#x27;m a healthy 24 year old woman and I can&#x27;t find a reason for the shedding.  I read that Amla oil helps grow hair, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  For the first month I was just applying it directly to my scalp, but then I felt inspired and made an elixir, using 1/2 amla oil 1/2 jojoba oil as a base, plus about 10 drops each of tea tree, rosemary, and clary sage essential oils.  I rub a few drops onto my scalp after each shampoo.  It hasn&#x27;t thickened my hair too much, but I have noticed that my hair is growing LONGER much faster.  If you&#x27;re looking to increase the length of your hair, buy this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is mild, pretty earthy and herbal.  I think it&#x27;s pleasant but it probably isn&#x27;t too palatable to a lot of Americans.  The bottle is really big for the price, and will last me forever at this rate.  I</li>
    <li> I learn about this product through Hairlicious/Hairlista Inc. I read that this oil would increase hair thickness, hair growth, shine and moisture. The oil did all of the above. The area were I saw instant results was thickness. Yes, my hair grew but the thickness was the first thing I and my family noticed right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used the product is as a pre shampoo treatment. I will leave the oil on my scalp/ hair overnight and then wash it out in the morning. And that has work wonders for my hair. Also, coconut oil seems to compliment this product very well. It seems to make the hair stronger, more manageable and mositurized. I also use Amla oil on my scalp mixed with olive oil and it seems to make my new gowth or roots soft and easy to comb or detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little jarring however, I put in essential oils such as rosemary and peppermint oil to mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and it is now my new favorite hair product. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing oil. I have hormonal hair thinning, and it helps.  It does smell a bit like licorice. Nothing I can&#x27;t live with, especially if it works.</li>
    <li> Smell seems woodsy. It does leave my hair soft but nothing compares to organic coconut oil for me personally. Fast shipping but not my go to product</li>
    <li> OMG this oil is amazing. It made my hair so soft and its not as long b/c i just started using it; however, one will see shine/softness after use.</li>
    <li> You will not see any amazing improvements using this oil. It weighs your hair down and takes a couple of washes to get it out.  Also it will leave a stain on any thing it touches.  Bad choice on my part.  Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> Good oil. Makes my hair smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> it has a nutty sort of smell and i don&#x27;t mind it at all. i put it on at night or in the morning on a day when i&#x27;m not going out and leave it in as long as i possible.  i have thin hair and i started using this on a regular basis a few months ago. have defintely seen a difference. my hair seems healthier and more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;. i also use a tiny bit of argan oil after washing. i haven&#x27;t gone out with it in my hair yet, but when it&#x27;s in my hair and i pull it back into a ponytail, it looks like some people i have seen in magaizines -- you know -- when their hair is slicked back. looks rather good, if you&#x27;re into that look.&lt;br /&gt;at this point, i just love the fact that my hair looks thicker than it ever did before.</li>
    <li> This oil is by far the best hair conditioner I have ever tried. I haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet. Every time I use it it leaves my hair shiny and very soft making my hair look very healthy.</li>
    <li> Love it so far  smells great in my opinion you leave it in for a day and wash it out your hair is soft as a chinchilla lol well maybe not that soft but pretty soft its great stuff . :-)</li>
    <li> works great, my hair is thicker and fuller then it has ever been. great product.</li>
    <li> This oil conditioned my hair very well (under my conditioner) but it won&#x27;t last me very long. My hair is down my back past my waist so i need a lot of oil. Other than that it does what it promises to do.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on the Meredith Vieira show.  Having always had a problem with dry, frizzy hair, when Meredith interviewed Mrs. Obama&#x27;s hairdresser and he recommended this \\&quot;secret\\&quot; for solving the problem of dry hair, I decided to give it a try.  (I will admit that his mentioning that it is an \\&quot;inexpensive\\&quot; solution to the problem was a motivating factor)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my usual shampoo, I dried my hair and I applied a small amount of Amla oil, massaging it and leaving it in.  The change was immediate and dramatic...an amazing difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now shampoo about once a week; but I apply a small amount of Amla oil after showering each day.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to build-up nor does it have any perceptible odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amla Hair Oil - Where have you been all my life?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now. And I have to be honest and say that I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference at all after using. I just can&#x27;t tell a difference. Maybe I haven&#x27;t been using this often enough (which is about 2 to 3 times a week) or for long enough period of time. But I can&#x27;t say that the claims that are made about this product are true in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it once....so no results just yet. Will definitely report as time progresses.</li>
</ol>
