      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>so I wasnt sure what to do with it</li>
      <li>Might grow even more.</li>
      <li>The best product, I been using this product for 3 years, the first time my hair was tangle, and my hair grew so fast</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make a lot of suds, but that&#x27;s a good thing, because it&#x27;s very natural</li>
      <li>I received it pretty fast, and in good condition, I noticed it had a very nice smell, very natural clean smell.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>it barely falls out GOOD product</li>
      <li>Have patience--I&#x27;m willing to use this product for 6 months or more to realize its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to admit that I have more hair than my older borther.</li>

      <li>I had just gotten highlights, so I would recommend having a natural color, so your hair won&#x27;t get tooo damaged, this is meant to dry your hair and open up your pores, so make sure you have a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>It shipped pretty fast</li>
      <li>but i usually condition with nexus conditioner which makes my hair smell really good.</li>
      <li>I did a ton of research online for hair growth and ultimately the answer was: Good nutrition, Drinking plenty of water, not washing your hair every single day, using a comb to untangle your hair instead of a brush, exercise, and not stressing out, and  </li>
      <li>I am going to continue using this product to see if it really works.</li>
      <li>The item was received in a timely manner, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>After noticing my hair was getting very tangled</li>
      <li>this product dries your hair and you have to use almost the whole bottle to get your hair  </li>
      <li>really works.[[ASIN:B000O8SMU8</li>
      <li>I started to only use it twice a week but mixing it with my regular shampoo, I also got the dove conditioning treatment, I honestly don&#x27;t think hair growth has to do with shampoo, it has to do with your nutrition and exercise.</li>
      <li>Although the shampoo makes a sticky mess and very few bubbles; after conditioner is applied my hair is easily managed and appears more healthy.</li>
      <li>It does give my hair nice body and it does last a long time.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>de perder mi cabello porque perdia cantidades enormes de pelo ahora se me cae pero de manera normal y parece que estoy recuperando algo.</li>
      <li>It works, my hair was thinning by my forehead and after using it 3 times I started seeing new hair growth.</li>
      <li>--restoration will certainly not occur overnight either, and if it does, one would most likely become a slave to the product anyway (e.g. Rogaine).</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair and scalp so very clean without the dryness of other shampoos,  Plus, I think that my hair may actually look thicker from this product.</li>
      <li>It actually made my hair stop falling out so much</li>
      <li>With the product it stopped falling off completely.</li>
      <li>Very watery in comparison to former deliveries!!!!!</li>
      <li>So far, he likes the tingling sensation when he washes his hair with Cre-C shampoo.  </li>

      <li>So far I like it.</li>

      <li>The product arrive very fast and it has the liquid and the active formula apart, that happen because it has a lot of time without shake.</li>

    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over six months now.  I do not have a head of thick hair.  But there is some peach fuzz in some places.  I will continue to use the shampoo basically because I just like it.  It does give my hair nice body and it does last a long time.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo in Mexico very often, recently moved to US and didn&#x27;t know how to get it.  I went to latino groceries stores with no luck, until I saw it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It has been a great help.  Started to lose a lot of hair after my pregnancies.  Cre-c does help me keep my hair from falling.</li>
    <li> we call and send emails sometimes and never got a answer about this shampoo   I don&#x27;t think we would like to do bisiness with this company they got the money and we never got the merchandise  raul cabriales  3606 florine st  houston, texas 77087  713-416-0485</li>
    <li> Hello,    I purchased this item for my son.  He suffers from alopecia and after trying so many products, he decided to try this one.  So far, he likes the tingling sensation when he washes his hair with Cre-C shampoo.  The item was received in a timely manner, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love the product. The order arrive in the time expected. I will defently buy again from this seller. Love Amazon!</li>
    <li> this product dries your hair and you have to use almost the whole bottle to get your hair  enough suds&lt;br /&gt;and able to work it in you scalp makes your hair like hay very dry</li>
    <li> Recently bought Cre-C shampoo is been making my hair stronger, less and less hair falls out everytime i wash my hair, the smell is not great but i usually condition with nexus conditioner which makes my hair smell really good. i will keep using it since i bought the pack of 3 lets see how long my hair gets in the next few months!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions on the bottle each time I took a shower, but it did not work for me at all. Still the same. Is the second product I have tried for Hair Growth, none worked. I lost my money.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this poduct...so far so good. The box came with three sets of shampoo \\&quot;No Conditioner\\&quot; &amp; three small bottles of some type of liquid treatment. The sm bottle of liquid treatment did NOT come with no instructions so I wasnt sure what to do with it, however I mixed the liquid in the shampoo. Also, the shampoo doesnt say how often to use it (i.e. one or three times a wk).   The CONS about it was that the shipping took way to long \\&quot;almost two wks). I am going to continue using this product to see if it really works.</li>
    <li> Uso este shampoo desde hace aproximadamente un mes. Lo use sin El Ppc50  y ahora lo pienso usar conpleto, creo que El resultado sera mejor por lo menos deje de perder mi cabello porque perdia cantidades enormes de pelo ahora se me cae pero de manera normal y parece que estoy recuperando algo. Usenlo y no se arrepentiran.</li>

    <li> The shampoo is also makes my hair freeze.&lt;br /&gt;The RCA does not work .&lt;br /&gt;The pen camera doesn&#x27;t record no sign off recording.</li>
    <li> I got used to this shampoo...&lt;br /&gt;At least I get the perception that I am doing something to keep some hair on my head...&lt;br /&gt;But I have to admit that I have more hair than my older borther.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo and used it for a few weeks. My hair seems to feel fuller and thicker. Not sure if my hair is growing more, but I did reorder more and we;ll see how it goes.</li>

    <li> Although the shampoo makes a sticky mess and very few bubbles; after conditioner is applied my hair is easily managed and appears more healthy.</li>
    <li> The product arrive very fast and it has the liquid and the active formula apart, that happen because it has a lot of time without shake. You only need to see if the expiration date is ok!</li>
    <li> So far I like it. I will see the result in few months.</li>
    <li> Been using for a week. Waiting to see if it works.</li>
    <li> It works, my hair was thinning by my forehead and after using it 3 times I started seeing new hair growth.</li>
    <li> Too bad it is not available in Canada, In Mexico I buy it at the corner store. Very expensive to have it mailed from the US. Wish I knew it could be bought over the counter in the US.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo love it. really works.[[ASIN:B000O8SMU8 Cre-C - Shampoo Cre C Max for Regrowing Hair &amp; Hair Loss 8.46 oz]]</li>
    <li> Best shampoo to grow back hair loss.</li>
    <li> The best product, I been using this product for 3 years, the first time my hair was tangle, and my hair grew so fast , I recommend the product . For woman crece fem , you don&#x27;t get tangle and the hair is shiny the only thing is that take too much time to grow .</li>
    <li> I was loosing a lot of hair, tried several different products and Cre-C definitely made a difference.</li>
    <li> This is my experience and every hair is different soooo...I bought this after my hairstylist told me this helps your hair grow faster. I received it pretty fast, and in good condition, I noticed it had a very nice smell, very natural clean smell. It didn&#x27;t make a lot of suds, but that&#x27;s a good thing, because it&#x27;s very natural, I noticed as soon as I started massaging my scalp it was getting very tangled, and it felt very very thick. I had just gotten highlights, so I would recommend having a natural color, so your hair won&#x27;t get tooo damaged, this is meant to dry your hair and open up your pores, so make sure you have a good conditioner. After noticing my hair was getting very tangled I started to only use it twice a week but mixing it with my regular shampoo, I also got the dove conditioning treatment, I honestly don&#x27;t think hair growth has to do with shampoo, it has to do with your nutrition and exercise. I did a ton of research online for hair growth and ultimately the answer was: Good nutrition, Drinking plenty of water, not washing your hair every single day, using a comb to untangle your hair instead of a brush, exercise, and not stressing out, and  I bought biotin vitamins. The shampoo helped it get thick but not necessarily longer.</li>
    <li> i have not received yet is been a amost a month   send emails and not a respond.  please some one let me know what to do or where to call</li>
    <li> I still using everyday to prove what everybody says aboit it and it looks good</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves my hair and scalp so very clean without the dryness of other shampoos,  Plus, I think that my hair may actually look thicker from this product.</li>
    <li> great product love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and I&#x27;m pleased with the results, hair seems to have improved it strength.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this Sham,poo in conjunction with a laser comb to combat thinning hair and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Thank you graet product</li>
    <li> Its everything it says it is on the tv. It actually works. My mom has very thin hair and it was falling off. With the product it stopped falling off completely. I couldn&#x27;t believe it myself</li>
    <li> Not much regrowth at this point but enough to definitely keep me motivated to using it daily!  My wife and son both noticed signs of re-growth at the hairline and at the balding area on the back of my head.  I have always held naturally derived botanicals in high regard and feel this is the best course overall in the areas of health and cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have used this product for several weeks and feel the verdict is still out or appears to be ineffective, do not give up hope!  Recall that in most cases, receding hairlines did not occur overnight--restoration will certainly not occur overnight either, and if it does, one would most likely become a slave to the product anyway (e.g. Rogaine). Have patience--I&#x27;m willing to use this product for 6 months or more to realize its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if my hair regrowth stays minimal at least I have the satisfaction of knowing that I finally have in my hands a product which should diminish the onset of further hair loss!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo . I have used it for a while now and noticed a little fuzz coming out on my head lately. I&#x27;ll keep trying. Thank&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recomend this product to anyone. I used it none stop till I finished all three bottles. Aproximately 4 months grew a few thick hairs mostly peach fuzz, even now 5 months later after I finished the bottles the peach fuzz became thicker hair and keeps getting thicker. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase another box. Might grow even more.</li>
    <li> My mother in law uses this. Her hair is definitely thicker and growing.</li>
    <li> I used for my hair is no working i not recommended to any body to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Is suppose working growing up your hair and not working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and nothing is happening...It shipped pretty fast but its said to know that is not working.</li>
    <li> It actually made my hair stop falling out so much but i have to brush it everyday now it barely falls out GOOD product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using shampoo Cre-C for a year and it works my hair is growing back. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> There are lots of fake products out there.  Every time I order, it&#x27;s a hit or miss. I could tell by the smell of it and the feel after using the product. Not sure what to do.</li>
    <li> It is good for my husband, he started using this a year ago in Baja California, Mexico  with good results</li>
</ol>
