<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is not what sigma eye kit looks like... this is the \\&quot;PERFORMANCE EYE KIT&#x27;&#x27; not SIGMA EYE KIT... when i got this product i was so excited coz i can&#x27;t wait to use the performace eye kit and when i open the box its not the performance eye kit that i expected it just the standard eye kit this sellers sucks and doesn&#x27;t do there job to labelled it right!</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product !</li>
    <li> You really get a lot of quality brushes for so little.  I have yet to use all the brushes but will eventually. If you buy them all separately it could cost a fortune.  If you wear makeup religiously I would invest in this set .</li>
    <li> I think the brushes should match with the numbers as in the picture. A bit annoying to find incorrectly numbered brushes! I&#x27;ll return it.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with my order and will be returning these brushes.  I feel a bit misled, because the photos did not match the brushes I was sent.  In hindsight, I realize that the description did indicate the correct brush numbers, but I was expecting to get the brushes that were pictured.  I was understandably disappointed when these brushes arrived at my door, but I decided to try them out anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying Sigma brushes.  While I think that the overall quality of the brushes is great due to their sturdy construction, I have a major qualm with the size of the brushes.  When I tried to use them, I found that most of them are way too big for my very small eyes.  The brush hairs are very long and flimsy, so they tend to leave obnoxiously large marks of eye shadow across my small lids.  I&#x27;m sure these brushes work really well on people with large eye lids, but I do not recommend these brushes for people with small eyes.  I am hoping that I can still get a refund despite having opened the brushes already.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I have quite a few sigma brushes and these are a great addition to my collection. Easy to clean and they work great!</li>
    <li> this will give you many of the basics to start your eye collection brushes. They are great quality.</li>
    <li> This eye set is PERFECTION. You get the brushes you need the most in an affordable, high quality set. You can&#x27;t go wrong. Why would you pay 25 dollars for ONE MAC brush when you get 7 for 45? The brushes are so soft, sturdy, and overall amazing. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this set. My next Sigma Brush purchase will be for face brushes because I need more Sigma in my life :D</li>
    <li> I read and watched a lot of reviews of these Sigma Brushes before I got them. I was surprised at how many raving reviews there were of Sigma products and now I know why. I got the Sigma Beauty Eyes Kit a week ago. They come packaged in sheer colorful bags which are really cute. I am really happy with these brushes so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are dense, soft, and shaped perfectly for eyes. I would say these brushes are slightly large so they may be harder to use if you have small eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorites are the E40 Tapered blending- it is really soft and the perfect size for blending colors all over the eyelid and outer edges especially, and the E70 Medium Angled shading fits into my outer corner crease perfectly. This brush is actually my favorite for applying color there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The E55 Eye Shading is a very standard eye shadow brush that definitely needs to be part of everyone&#x27;s kit, as well as the E30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll have use for the Large Shader, it is so large. But, overall this set is a great one, and not only for the price. It is complete with any brush you would use for eyes so you won&#x27;t be missing anything.&lt;br /&gt;I will be replacing brushes with sigma in the future!</li>
    <li> these are great brushes for eye makeup, whether it&#x27;s for smoky eyes or just daily light makeup.  it&#x27;s a set with just the right amount and type of brushes, unlike those with many different brushes that you don&#x27;t know what to use for.  great quality, soft brushes that really evens out color when applying shadow.  totally great purchase!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for applying eyeshadows with depth and layers. I find each brush very useful. Great addition to my collection. I love these brushes the most out of every other brands eye brushes that I use.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these brushes via amazon. I have been playing with them for the past 3-4 days, just to see how they feel and how they work. So far I am impressed. My brush collection is various, but the dominating brushes in it are from this Italian brand INuovi, and they are quite pricey/good quality. To be honest, Sigma brushes are equally good, if not better, because they are so affordable. Overall, I am satisfied, and would recommend them to a friend, in fact I already have.</li>
    <li> Just got the Beauty Eyes Kit From Sigma today. The brushes are all just superb, top notch quality ! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> First off, shipping was super fast! Second, these brushes are AMAZING! I&#x27;ve been a \\&quot;makeup addict\\&quot; for years now, but never put the money into buying good brushes. Now I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without them. All of these brushes in this kit are excellent. They&#x27;re soft, fluffy, and apply color phenomenally. And for the price, they can&#x27;t be beat. If you&#x27;re looking for your first set of good quality brushes, I HIGHLY recommend these!</li>
    <li> Sigma makes amazing brushes! Every brush I have ordered is great. I got the medium angled shading, eye shading, pencil, large shader, tapered blending, small angle, and eye liner brush. I love the kit. The eye kit includes everything you need for a natural to smokey dramatic eye look. The brushes are made with natural fibers and glide on the eyes for a sleeky and beautiful look. I recommend purchasing these brushes!</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say about the product or seller</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!  I didn&#x27;t take proper care of my Mac brushes, so I needed some new ones.  I did not want to spend a ton of money on new brushes, so I started researching other options.  I came across the Sigma brushes and thought I would give them a try.  I am so happy that I did, they are great quality brushes for an amazing price.  I would recommend them to everyone.  They are very comparable to my Mac brushes, but I think I will only buy these from now on.</li>
    <li> These brushes are just great. Soft, well put together, nice long handles unlike a lot of the \\&quot;brush kits\\&quot; you see. These are truly professional grade brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased brush kits before - usually you get a bunch of brushes (many of which are repeats *ahem*) with short handles, pokey bristles that shed easily, and they are still quite expensive considering the low quality of the brushes. And no, I&#x27;m not talking about those Christmas gift sets you find at Wal-Mart for $4.88, I&#x27;m talking about brush kits you&#x27;d purchase at Sephora!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 7 brushes in this kit, and at $45 that comes to around $6.43 per brush! It doesn&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about these brushes. I have bought MAC brushes in the past, but I honestly prefer these. MAC brushes are expensive, where these brushes are very affordable. The best thing is, the quality is very similar (if not exactly the same). I use these brushes every day, and will not be switching back to my MAC brushes anymore. As I said before, I prefer Sigma. THANKS SIGMA!</li>
    <li> (Note, the tag says Stephen, my husband.  I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d want me to clarify that.  :-)    A friend recommended these brushes and I owe her a thank you note!  First of all, they arrived very quickly.  I was very impressed by the look and feel of the brushes.  They are very solid and well constructed.  And they work like a dream, even better than some of my other, more expensive brushes.  I&#x27;m going to have to purchase the face kit next!</li>
    <li> This is the first set of professional brushes I&#x27;ve ever gotten and I regret waiting for so long! These brushes make application so much easier and so much nicer! Shipping and delivery was very fast too. Overall, I&#x27;m happy I spent the money on these brushes.</li>
    <li> received my new brushes and was excited never bought nothing that was not mac but i love my new set of brushes theres really no difference in the brushes from mac to sigma same quality and soft love them i will buy more brushes for sure thanks sigma for the great products u give us.</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes!!!! as an MUA i find myself using them all the time!!! i love the eyes kit... the brushes are soft and very practicle! love love love!    feel free to see how i use my sigma brushes and muabcarmen (on youtube!)</li>
    <li> She wanted these so bad so I eventually  bought them and she is very happy with them</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Sigma brushes! I wanted to start out with the basic eyes kit and build my collection up slowly. To anyone that may be on the fence about this kit, I can assure you that once you use these brushes you will be so happy! There is a major difference in utilizing these brushes in comparison to others, the blending and the way that these brushes glide on your eyes is foolproof. it is a great kit for begnners and/or novices, I also want to thank you for your amazing and speedy delivery time! will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> In love with my eye kit from sigma! The best producto ever! I recommend! I wanna buy a full kit from sigma!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing these brushes. I had purchased some more expensive brushes from a major retailer before and they fell apart soon after purchase even though I didn&#x27;t use them very often. These brushes were highly recommended by most of the sources where I did my research and they didn&#x27;t let me down. The brushes are great quality! They arrived very quickly and I even love the packaging. I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to using them for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that, number one the shipping was super fast even if during the holidays, the estimated delivery was in like 4 weeks but, it took only 10 days to get to Italy so i was very surprised. Number two The package was very well packed :-) and a little hard to open, so, no chances for stealing (overseas things get often stolen ). Now let&#x27;s talk about the brushes.... I have to say only one thing.... AMAZING..... I know that a lot of people say that everyone leave a positive review because of the complementary gift they&#x27;ll send you, but the truth is the brushes are good for real and they do deserve a positive review!!!!! They are super soft and there is almost no shedding if not at the first use, they pick up the eye shadow very well and i totally love them!!!! In the end, if you are looking for  awesome brushes at an affordable price, those are it!!!! Oh, i forgot to say that the customer service is also great!!!!!  Francesca.</li>
    <li> Super soft! Learned of these thru a makeup artist I have been following. I love them!!&lt;br /&gt;And it was shipped WAY faster then it said to allow. I had the brushes within a week of ordering, which made me even happier because I wanted to use them for wedding makeup and I was sad they wouldn&#x27;t be here. Imagine my joy when they were on my doorstep before the wedding!!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE....will likely be ordering other brushes in the future, just had to do one set to be sure!&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Smith</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know a lot about Make-up application.  Getting this brush set was my first step in really learning how to do eye makeup correctly.  I have been very happy with these brushes.  They are easy to use and they help the makeup go on so smoothly.  I was happy they came with descriptions for each brush and a how-to on caring for them.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Wife loves sigma for her makeup needs.  Gave as a present.</li>
    <li> I got my brush set in the mail last week which surprised me a lot since amazon said it would take 2 weeks longer then it has, awesome international shipping! And I have been using them after a good first wash every day. I really am satisfied with the set. No complains whatsoever. The shader brushes are a tad bit larger then i am used to but so soft... Makes the applying of makeup somewhat of a wellness treatment in the morning ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to makeup and wasn&#x27;t sure where to start when buying brushes and such. I asked around and watched a bunch of Youtube videos and pretty much everyone recommended Sigma brushes so I knew what I had to get. I love the way the brushes feel, they&#x27;re very soft, waaaay better than the sucky drugstore ones I was using for a while. So far I can only afford the Eyes Kit but hopefully I can expand my collection soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was speedy too which made me very happy!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice.  They don&#x27;t shed and clean up easily.  Very well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I just received my Sigma brushes and love them! I will most likely be purchasing the face makeup set also. Thank you Sigma for a great product!</li>
    <li> Great brushes, they are very soft! I spent money on cheaper brushes and it was a waste...just invest in these and you&#x27;ll be set</li>
    <li> Got my new brushes and they look great, bold and professional... great set of eye brushes. I am starting to wrk as a professional makeup artist and love this set... sure will start to replace some of my other brushes with more sigma products... tks</li>
    <li> I learned about these brushes through one of \\&quot;youtube&#x27;s makeup gurus\\&quot; and did some research. I considered buying individual eye-brushes from a store but these were a much better deal than a bunch of random eye-brushes. Now that I own them, I can accomplish a variety of looks and I love the quality of these brushes. The packet also comes with a pamphlet that explains the use and purpose of each look, this inspired new looks for me to try! Good buy!</li>
    <li> MAC who? These brushes are amazing! Please buy them before going to a MAC counter. They&#x27;re worth every penny! I&#x27;ve washed them quite often and they&#x27;re very durable yet soft. Will be getting my brushes from Sigma from now on.</li>
    <li> Got these brushes a week ago, they lived up to my expectations.  I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really handy and amazing! They are of very good quality for an affordable price. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> i loved the product, and im buying some more blushes because they are amazin!  the price is great for 7 brushes, and E40 and E30 are my favorit to blend eyeshadow</li>
    <li> I recently bought the face brush kit and liked it so much I decided to try the eye brushes as well.  I love them.  They were deliverd fast.  Good qualiity and very soft.</li>
    <li> From now sigma makeup brushes are my must have brushes. Besides loving and having brushes from MAC and Bobbi Brown, this would be the brushes that I would recommend, and I do recommend, to everyone. All females in my household own at least one Sigma makeup makeup brush set thanks to me. These brushes are idea for makeup lovers or makeup beginners (newbies) or any professional make up artist. The quality of these brushes is much better than other makeup brushes companies online today and is comparable with the best ones out there today, such as MAC and Bobbi Brown.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! The shipping was very efficient and the quality of the brushes are very nice. The brushes are so soft, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like some of my other brushes! Also I love how it comes with a guide with explanations about each brush. The brushes are also tappered, which is good for appoint whatever it is that you are using! Its worth the price! :)</li>
    <li> I am so happy that i purchased the Sigma Beauty Eyes kit. I have been using these brushes for over a week and they are soft, the bristles dont fall out, and they are easy to clean. I am very pleased with this set and i will be getting the face brushes.</li>
    <li> Muito bom!!! Depois de muito pesquisar em blogs, ele foi o mais recomendado!!!    Recomendo o site da MakeUpCamila. Há diversos vídeos com os pinceis!!!!</li>
    <li> First, I am Rodrigo&#x27;s wife, my name is Luisa.     I am very happy with my eyes kit! The brushes are great and so far they do not lose hair. They work very well with my eye shadows and the results are very good. The ones that I liked the most are the pencil brush (Pencil - E30) and the Small Angle - E65, the results are excellent! &#x3D;D     Also, the shipping was really fast. I was expecting the package to arrive at the 28th, and I got it today, the 22th.    Five stars!!!</li>
    <li> First of all: I received these brushes super fast, I ordered them on wednesday, and got them on friday. I really love how Amazon ships so fast. These brushes are awsome!!! All you need to create a PERFACT smokey eyes are the SIGMA brushes. They are so soft, and get right amount of color on youre eyes. I can sit here and write 2 pages long on how awsome these brushes are. I am a make up proffesional, and i love make up, I can deffenitely tell the difference between good quality brushes and bad ones. Long story short, I LOVE THEM!!! PERFACT!!!!</li>
    <li> These eye brushes are a great especially for the price. They are really soft and high quality and they blend my shadows beautifully. I can&#x27;t wait until my big eyeshadow palette comes so I can try even more looks.</li>
    <li> The Sigma Beauty Eyes Kit is a must-have for anyone wanting quality brushes at a good price. These brushes make working with loose shadow a breeze! All it takes is one use o realize that the drugstore brushes can&#x27;t touch Sigma brushes!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist that has worked in the industry for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve worked for two fantastic prestige brands, and these brushes are absolutely wonderful!! I figured that I&#x27;d order them and just try them out (I&#x27;m not afraid to return!) and now I will definitely be purchasing MORE! They came so much faster than predicted, and apply powders, cremes and even liquids beautifully. They saturate fantastically, don&#x27;t lift or drag, and blend VERY nicely. I tend to go through QUITE a few brushes, and I will for sure be refilling my belt with these. I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and have had hardly any shedding issue - like I usually do with my MAC and even Napoleon Perdis brushes. LOVE them!!</li>
    <li> Brushes were in good condition when they arrived and perfect for daily use.  After several cleaning, brushes hold their shape.</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend these brushes look elegant and very professional and most important they DONT SHEDDDD :) definitely buying them alll!</li>
    <li> Just received the brushes in the mail today - Amazon said they&#x27;d get here tomorrow! Brushes look great and I really appreciate the information about each brush. I&#x27;m a novice so it&#x27;s nice to know what the brushes are actually intended for. Washed the brushes for the first time and i&#x27;m looking forward to using them!</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! Im so inlove with this brushes,i bought them cause i didnt want to spend so much money on MAC brushes but i want it good quality brushes to do my make up and im so glad i bought them.They&#x60;re so soft and my make up looks so good,for me they&#x60;re great.    If u love make up u have to buy this brushes.  Loved it.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the other eye set available from sigma. I love both sets equally. The brushes are very nice, soft, and place makeup very well without a lot of shadowing. I would certainly buy these again as well as recommend them to someone. I have even recently cleaned these without any shedding. The black one did shed several hairs, but I&#x27;m hoping it will only be that one time. If not then I&#x27;m willing to rebuy it by itself later. I find it very good at blending.</li>
    <li> Worth the price - versatile selection of brushes for every makeup need.</li>
    <li> The brushes are packaged in a cute bag w/ brush guards.  This is a great set of brushes for a low price.</li>
    <li> I GOT THESE BRUSHES BECAUSE I WAS RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND HOW HAPPENS TO BE A MAKEUP JUNKIE AND OWNS EVERYTHING MAKEUP INCLUDING THE MOST EXPENSIVE MAKEUP BRUSHES, SO WHEN SHE RAVED ABOUT THESE BRUSHES AND METIONED THE AFFORDABLE PRICE, I HAD TO TRY THEM OUT. I WAS IMPRESS OF THE QUALITY OF THEM, FIRM HANDLE AND SUPPER SOFT BRISTLES. THEY DID THE JOB JUST LIKE HIGH PRICED BRUSHES WOULD, AND BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT, I DIDN&#x27;T HAD TO PAY A ARM AND A LEG FOR. SUPPER HAPPY WITH THEM.</li>
    <li> At first i thought I&#x27;ve bought the fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the simga beauty professional brush sets in year 2012 and i loved them. Last month I&#x27;ve purchased the eyes kit only as a backup and they are Nothing like the ones I bought last year. I am not a professional makeup artist but I can tell from the feel of using them. The brush does not blend the eye shadow easily and it doesn&#x27;t apply to my eye smoothly. Very very disappointed. Like I mentioned in the first sentence I thought I&#x27;ve bought a fake brush until I checked the seller-  same one as who i bought from last year. Not sure what happened to the brand :(</li>
    <li> I was honestly a little skeptical when i first heard about these brushes but i saw a lot of YouTube \\&quot;Gurus\\&quot; advertise them and say how great they were so i decided to buy some. I was pleasantly surprised, they are really great! I think they are even better than a lot of the MAC brushes over the years, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price. They are really great and i recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for good brushes for a long time &amp; I finally found them.  The sigma makeup brushes are amazing &amp; of great  quality.  My brushes came on time &amp; in great condition .</li>
    <li> I just received my order and though I haven&#x27;t used them yet, the brushes look like they&#x27;re in good shape. They come in a cute little pink pouch which I thought was a nice touch. Received them quicker than expected too.</li>
    <li> Sister in law loved this set... it was everything she wanted. Great quality!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally receive my brushes. I ordered the \\&quot;Eye Kit\\&quot; and five additional brushes to have the full set of eye brushes. I ripped the box open to find all the brushes in a cute mesh bag with a drawstring and each brush was in its own little plastic sleeve, none of the bristles has been bent or crumpled at a quick glance. There was a little card that explained to first clean before use soooo I did. No shedding &amp; no dye flowed thur the soapy clear water :o). Once dry I went to apply my shadows with and the brush felt like silk in combination with my eye primer &amp; eye shadows. I got a little more excited and decided to do the foiling technique....OMG!!! FLAWLESS!!! I soon found myself using each and every brush. The brushes are not heavily weighted so they really felt comfortable &amp; easy to control unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m looking forward to passing the word about Sigma. I recommend these brushed to anyone who is looking for the perfect brushes at a affordable price - the next order will be the face brushes.</li>
    <li> Received these brushes a couple days ago and i am extremely pleased so far! Have only gotten to try a coupe of them but excited to try the rest! they are worth the purchase! I recommend these to any makeup junkie like myself!</li>
    <li> I have been watching make up tutorials and everyone raves about the Sigma brushes. I decided to order them and I must agree! They are soft and feel great on your lids. Each brush does it&#x27;s job and it is worth the money!</li>
    <li> Sólo hay 3 brochas realmente magníficas</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are my absolute favorite! Eyeshadow application is a breeze with these. These are very high quality brushes for a fraction of the cost. Very comparable to MAC brushes. I use at least one of these everyday.</li>
    <li> They were great - very satisfied would definitely recommend to anyone to buy them. Good quality and great price Happy!</li>
    <li> apparently my wife ordered this on my account so i cant give any first hand knowledge but i can say that i havent heard her complain about it so i assume she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she actually made a big deal about these things and i saw her putting a lot of effort into keeping them in good shape by washing and taking care of them... which ive never seen her do with anything else, including the bathroom sink area which is constantly a disaster with all her products everywhere... but these things were always thoughtfully placed in their spot... like things should be so... it appears that she loves them.</li>
    <li> I have not used them yet but they did come when they were supposed to and all the pieces were in the box!</li>
    <li> Decent products at this price point. I would recommend that if you want to buy drugstore brushes, check out these first. Good brushes will last your longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Order the Sigma Beauty Eye Kit and it arrived sooner than expected.I received the kit in very good conditing.Excellent Quality. Would recomend this brushes. Overall very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of cosmetic brushes and I was a bit skeptical on which kit to get but decided on this one and let me tell you it was an amazing purchase. The brushes are very good quality little to no fall out of the bristles and so soft. Definitely recommend everyone to but themselves this kit.</li>
    <li> I am beyond obsessed with these brushes! I watch Jaclyn Hill&#x27;s you tube video and took her word for it. I am not one bit disappointed. These are the best brushes I have used so far. They are also way cheaper then Mac brushes and you can buy them in sets which is even better!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using the brushes they are sturdy and work well. Wished some were a little smaller some are a little too large...</li>
    <li> Just received them, I have been waiting for these brushes after reading so many good reviews.  I played with them a little and am getting ready to give them a first wash.  The quality feels really solid, soft and vibrant.  The kit came with instruction for care and a detailed explanation of the purpose of each brushes.  For all 7 brushes, the price is very reasonable.  If I buy them one by one at Sephora, it will cost a lot more.  I am happy with my Sigma brushes purchase here at Amazon!  Highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE GREAT QUALITY BRUSHES AT A GREAT PRICE.  THEY ARE VERY COMPARABLE TO BRUSHES THAT I HAVE PAID TRIPLE FOR.</li>
    <li> The Sigma brushes are of a superb quality, and extremely reasonably priced.  The brush bristles for the Sigma Beauty Eyes Kit are very secure and do not fall out on use (like some of the more expensive brushes I have purchased.)    I&#x27;m really pleased with the Eye Brushes, and am excited to get the Face Brushes on my next order.    Well done Sigma!</li>
    <li> I really like all of the brushes. The blending brush loses some hairs here and there but it works good. My favorite brush is the eyeliner one. It looks massive, but it fine tip is soft and the base of the hairs are a little stiff allowing a nice glide to do a cute winged liner effect. Also really easy to do the cat eye. The large shadow brush recommended for cream eye shadow needs to be cleaned out more often because after a couple days of use the bristles start clumping; making the application uneven. Over all these brushes are worth the price you pay!</li>
    <li> Excellect brushes. Highly recommended. Better quality then mac brushes. Would definitely buy more. I love sigma brushes they make applying makeup effortless.</li>
    <li> I started watching YouTube videos on different makeup tutorials and most everyone used Sigma brushes so I decided to try it out. I absolutely love these brushes! They are so soft and work great to get the job done.</li>
    <li> i came across this product through this youtube videos makeup tutorial and decided to check them out.. i was a little hesitant to try these brushes but, once I have tried them my eyeshadow application has changed! Brushes are wonderful definitely worth it, and very economical.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with these brushes. I&#x27;ve heard so many you tubers praising this brand, that I expected to love these as well. I have and enjoy the Sigma Sigmax set, but these did not live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday for several years now and they are still perfect.</li>
    <li> Glad I found these!  My cheap brushes just were not cutting it! &lt;33333  I just recently purchased smashbox eyeshadows and I am now able to really create some dramatic looks with these!</li>
    <li> these brushes are amazing!.  i love the softness of the bristles, my shadow stays on with very minimal fall out.  i have tried many brushes as a makeup artist and these are by far my favorite</li>
    <li> I just received my Sigma Eyes Kit and what can I say, well worth it. I should have purchased these a long time ago.  Being someone who loves makeup, especially eyeshadow, I&#x27;m always watching beauty bloggers on YouTube.  My favorite looks all have one thing in common, Sigma Brushes.  I decided to give them a try.  These are great!!!  I wish I&#x27;d purchased them a long time ago and left the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brands at the store. I plan to order more brushes in the future and build my collection!  I also received my order pretty quickly.  I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase!</li>
    <li> The brushes are easy to use and own for each intended use. Bristles are very soft and light, providing an excellent experience of use!</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good for beginners who are just starting out with makeup, the quality of these brushes is really good and shedding is minimal. the shipping was unbelieavebly fast! only 5 days for international orders! really recommend this brush kit.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item with the Sigma \\&quot;Make Me Classy\\&quot; professional brush kit, and I absolutely ADORE it!! I ordered my items on a Thursday and received them that following Saturday. Shipping was wonderful, fast, and handled with care. I will always order my makeup brushes from sigma from now on. Life long customer right here!! :)</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!i have mac brushes too but one of my friend told me about sigma brushes and finally i got them yesterday.they are amazing,super soft and work better than mac brushes. if you love make up you should definately invest money on them.highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m VERY impressed with the shipping of Amazon (arrived three days earlier than estimated. Love the product; the brushes are high quality. They have heft and the detail on them is well-done. Nicely packaged in a black leather case as well. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> The brushes are perfect in length. They are soft. I cleaned all of them and i only saw some shedding on the blending brush. Other then that I like them. I would definitely recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes,the ladies on youtube beatfacehoney and liquidlinerlover aka beautybylee,use these brushes so I had to break down and buy them. I have brushes from Target,and Walgreens,The Dollar store. I will contine to use them, but these are some nice brushes.The handles are long,the brushes are so soft. you will just have to try them like I did. They are nice.</li>
    <li> I think the brushes should match with the numbers. A bit annoying to find incorrectly numbered brushes...and the case should be included!</li>
    <li> jst as a disclaimer, I am not a make up brush snob or anything but i will have to say tht i love the quality of these brusher, i use this brand as well as mac, coastal scents, and ecotools and i reach for these brusher before anything else. im in the process of buying of the other kits because i love them tht much !! everybody tht want good quality brushers needs to have these !!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! I own almost all of the Sigma brushes, and this basic eye set is perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Best set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I always order this for my wife and now she start to order it to her friends and her family so it seem they love it so that everybody asking me to order it for them.</li>
    <li> the brushes were not what I expected them to be.  I found the blending shadow brush too long and not thick enough.  Overall, I didn&#x27;t care for any of the brushes, I am returning this set.</li>
    <li> They are great brushes. I will now order a set for my kit. The first set was for my personal use.</li>
    <li> I just got these and they are perfect for doing everything I wanted to with my eyes. I had a wonderful smokey eye last night that I couldn&#x27;t have done without these! I have had a lot of different brushes, but these are really good quality. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had super nice brushes which made eyeshadow application a bit hard. These brushes really do make SO much difference with blending and precise application of colors. I think the price for the 6 brushes is great! Can&#x27;t wait to buy the face brushes.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected but great quality. Each brush is labeled with its purpose for makeup newbies. Great price, and some brush essentials.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of purchasing a makeup brush set from amazon that had good description and reviews at a great price. Unfortunately the set was utter garbage and fell apart almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing extensive research and watching Youtube  recommends from beauty expert Lisa Eldridge, I bought this Sigma set, along with [[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Kabuki - F80]] and [[ASIN:B005WLVC5O EcoTools Touch Up Set]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are excellent quality and arrived exactly as the image and description indicates. I have used every brush many times and find the handles to be the perfect length and the bristles to be soft yet incredibly precise. The combined sets I purchased perfectly round out my brush collection and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! Five Stars!</li>
    <li> I really like the Sigma Eye Kit ! I decided to go for the eye kit, because I needed good eye make up brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Sooo glad I did! The quality is awesome and the brushes work for me.</li>
    <li> Cool brushes. Wish they were cheaper..</li>
    <li> It would be better if Sigma listed the kits according to the level of experience a user with make-up brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kits also need to do a better job of matching up the brushes with the correct numbers.  One of the brushes that I received is not numbered correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for the price I paid, you can at least provide a case for the brushes.  I don&#x27;t think at this price I should pay&lt;br /&gt;for a case, this is something that you need to provide as a whole product.</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to eye makeup, and this kit is the perfect set. It has all the brushes you need. The brushes themselves are beautiful and the bristles are very soft. I had no fall out and I have had them for about a week now. The length of the handles are perfect for the best control.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know how i lived without these!</li>
    <li> I have purchased many brushes before but these are te best quality ones I have ever used. The product moves easily and they make blending a breeze!</li>
    <li> These brushes lived up to my expectations and then some. Glad I finally stopped over thinking and ordered them.</li>
    <li> Wonderful slightly specialized set of brushes here at a decent price. I have them and love them when working shadow changes between styling. Great value and very good product, more of a 4.5 for me as brands like Make Up For Ever or Mac are a fav for me, but these - for the price outdo them.</li>
    <li> Great product. Don&#x27;t shed. Have had them for 6 months and they&#x27;re still like new. I love ALL Sigma brushes. Have never been disappointed by this brand.</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredible! They blend out shadows so easily and are dense so there isn&#x27;t any fall out. The quality of these brushes and the price is something you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific brush set by Sigma! I just received this a few days ago and have used the brushes twice and I&#x27;m in love. The only brush I wish were included is the E25 Blending brush (which I have since ordered separately). This is a fantastic eye brush kit and very reasonable for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd set of brushes I&#x27;ve bought this year and they are wonderful!!!!! They are soft and don&#x27;t shed, they clean easily and the heads haven&#x27;t separated from the body like my other cheaper set did. I use the crease, eyeliner, fluffy and small flat brush the most, they pick up shadows easily as well. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes, they are wonderful quality! I have used them everyday since I purchased them. 5stars! They improve the look of my make up and make application simple.</li>
    <li> Love this kit. It really does have the essential eye brushes . I&#x27;ve learned how to use them by watching Jaclyn Hill&#x27;s make up tutorials on you tube.</li>
    <li> Purchase this Sigma Basic Eyes Kit brushes as a birthday gift for my daughter.  She just absolutely love, love them!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are fine but I was expecting more. They are fine but I don&#x27;t think they are worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great Sigma kit, wish it had more for the kind money we pay.</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and bought a set of the Sigma eye brushes. It was the best thing I could have done. I have only used them once but my eye makeup went on like a dream.  Can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
    <li> Received my Sigma Eye Kit brushes very quickly.  Quality brushes do make a difference in application and the look you are trying to achieve.  I will definitely order more for foundation and blush.</li>
    <li> I have been watching make up tutorials and everyone raves about the Sigma brushes. I decided to order them and I must agree! They are soft and feel great !! I love this brushes</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with these brushes.  I normally use the MAC brushes, but found that these are pretty good and work just as well!  I definitely suggest them.</li>
    <li> Agree with the other reviews, this product is great, can&#x27;t wait to put my hands on the precision set.  The angled brush is my favorite on in the set.</li>
    <li> Really good brushes. I Plan on buying another set. The only one I don&#x27;t really care for is the blending brush, I think it&#x27;s too flimsy, not firm enough, but overall, they are winners.</li>
    <li> Pros: Great Quality, Brush for every Need, Sleek/Professional Design&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Pricey (but worth it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I love this set! You can definitely see the difference when you use a pro set compared to the cheapo brushes from the drugstore. I used to use my $1 eyeshadow brush from Target for everything. And yes I got less than thrilling results. With this brush set and my new sephora makeup kit, my eye makeup looks way better simply due to the quality and versatility of these brushes. I am a total amateur at doing makeup and these brushes have helped me up my game. Totally recommend!! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I do like these brushes however with the blending brush there is some fall out.  I have other Sigma brushes and have never had that problem.  Still like the brushes, but will buy directly from Sigma next time (they are the same price) to ensure they aren&#x27;t fake.</li>
    <li> Love love love. I am a professional and these are worth every bit of the money. They are a great product</li>
    <li> It’s a great product! The bristles are soft, yet thick enough to give better control on application. The best basic eye makeup kit.</li>
    <li> I got this set together with my kabuki brush and I have to say they work perfectly, i mainly use cream and gel eye products so this set do wonders, I couldnt be more happier...thank you Sigma</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and our daughter loves them. What else can we ask for?</li>
    <li> Best investment ever thanks</li>
    <li> I heard about these brushes from a friend. I was on the market for makeup brushes and thought I would give them a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. I love this brush set. They have a good length, weight, and balance that makes them easy to hold and use. The natural bristles are soft and are great for creating whatever eye looks you desire. I understand why YouTube is lit up with tutorials and makeup artists talking about this company and their brushes. They are great!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, but pricey.  I just bought A set from LAMORA, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference!</li>
    <li> I love this line of makeup brushes!  Excellent quality,  bristles are nice,  good price!  Recommended!  Better than bhumi and cheaper than mac but same quality!</li>
    <li> Loving sigma Brushes! they are so soft and gentle on skin! Sigma brushes are the Best! Definitely going to buy more products!</li>
    <li> my favorite brushes !!</li>
    <li> my sister ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;She has no complaints. The colors are nice and does what it&#x27;s needed for.</li>
    <li> I loved the eye kit. The brushes are soft and the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are awesome, I never knew what I was missing out using the standard sponge brush. Using these brushes add so much more dimension to your shadows and makes even drugstore makeup look good, I highly recommend theses brushes to all.</li>
    <li> The quality is really great for the price. I&#x27;ve had these for a few months and they wash up well. The handles are nice and long. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried some of the brushes if purchased individually, but they&#x27;re all great! Glad I tried these!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake, not original!!!!! I showed the kit to my friend and she told it was fake. I ordered the same kit on Sigma online store and it came completely different!!!</li>
    <li> not impressed with  the quality</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister. She absolutely loved them. She says they are great for blending. She is very happy with her gift.</li>
    <li> Thought these were fake brushes but seller assures they&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re already shedding after only two washes and they just don&#x27;t feel like great quality. Oh well, they get the job done I guess.</li>
