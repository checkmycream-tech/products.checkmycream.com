      <li>Fujiyama colognes (or, EDTs) are some most elegant, fresh colognes available on the market.</li>

      <li>My wife bought this for her brother, she opened to make sure this is the right scent for him--not too strong and overpowering.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. that&#x27;s why I always purchase them.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, this smells fantastic but doesn&#x27;t last as long. I love it and am on my second bottle. I will continue to use this for the price and great smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was shelved for a long time or if this just really smells bad but its just awful. It smelled fine the day I got it and now barely 2 weeks later it smells rancid. I&#x27;ll be going to compare it to other department store samples to confirm what exactly is wrong. Amazon usually pulls through well and takes care of the problem, but i dont know why this cologne jus went \\&quot;bad\\&quot; in such a short time. Will be going for refund if its something wrong with this particular bottle.</li>
    <li> It smells good, i do not think it smells like Acqua di Gio. This is more of a sweet/spicy musk, instead of the citrus you get with di Gio. The problem with it is that it only lasts about an hour. I work in a mall and i spray the cologne on every morning before work and i ALWAYS get compliments on my scent the first hour and a half of work then nothing at all the rest of the day unless i hug someone.  Smells nice... for a little while</li>
    <li> This was great. Cheap and exactly what I wanted. Bought for the boyfriend and it smells great on him!</li>
    <li> This has been one my favorites now a days.  First time i order its mild, watery some what long lasting.. Worth for the money.. I would suggest to buy if you like Georgio Acqua, its having 50% of those smell.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Fujiyama for about 5 years now and I have to say for the price, you cannot beat it. This smells fantastic. Very comparable to Acqua di Gio( which I also own). Try it and see.I guarantee anyone who smells this on you will complement you.I would consider myself fairly knowledgeable on mens colognes  of all varieties as I favor for myself Calvin Klein Calvin, Acqua di Gio, Halston Z-101, Hilfiger Atheletics,Kenneth Cole Reaction,amongst the variety I personally wear and own. If your budget doesn&#x27;t allow for Acqua di Gio, Fujiyama is about as good a second (and down the line maybe even a first) choice.</li>
    <li> This product smeells fantastic is all i can say.      The only thing i would change of it would be to make it just a small bit more pungent so it can last longer.     Other than that, its just a wonderful scent. I would compare it to armais and some of the armani scents.</li>
    <li> the product is pretty much worth the money, smells very cool, and fresh yet vanishes very fast feel as if you did not wear any in the first place. ideal for work and school. the fragrance does not bother other, it is rather refreshing.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to a friend &amp; he loved the cologne!!</li>
    <li> i got it a little later than i should have, but smells so sweet and little spicy, it lasts long with a great value. but without a doubt 5 stars product.... Hidden treasure is the right comment for this product.</li>
    <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve bought, ladies love this!! I&#x27;m telling you this smells so good, ladies will be complementing you left and right !!! You difinetley want this cologne I&#x27;ve already bought another one just in case I run out of the I already have in use .</li>
    <li> Fujiyama Homme and Fujiyama Gentleman were two more recent additions to my cologne collection, I couldn&#x27;t decide between Homme and Gentleman and for such a low price for a whopping 3.4 ounces, my logic immediately became the same as that of the young latina girl from the Old El Paso taco commercials; \\&quot;Por que no los dos?\\&quot; So, I got both. At first, I really didn&#x27;t like Fujiyama Homme. The scent right off the bat wasn&#x27;t too pleasant, but after some time it dried down to something different that I liked much, much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles for the Fujiyama fragrances are pretty spiffy and well made. The glass is nice and thick, and mas more of a misty matted finish to it. Pretty cool. The sprayer works perfectly and lodged between the two \\&quot;pillar\\&quot; like structures. Yeah the sprayer and cap are flimsy plastic but, can&#x27;t have it all for around ten bucks right? I have had no trouble with the sprayer so if it works I&#x27;m happy. Fujiyama definitely puts their juices in some of the neater bottles on the market in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fujiyama Homme is clasified as a fresh woody fragrance. The top notes are mint, bamboo and cloves. The middle notes are nutmeg, geranium, cedar and red pepper. The base notes are vetiver, benzoin and cardamom. Right out of the nozzle, the mint and cloves (to me) sort of just sucker punch your sinuses. It&#x27;s not the best combination and while it doesn&#x27;t smell BAD, it doesn&#x27;t smell great either. Like a strange combination of mint gum and spices; it&#x27;s more strange than anything else. Now this fragrance needs to be given time don&#x27;t judge it too quickly becuase after it has had time to settle on the skin it becomes something else. It&#x27;s then that the cedar, red pepper, start to come out to round off the mint and cloves into something much cleaner and sweeter. Once the base notes come in Fujiyama Homme becomes much less harsh and really rounds out into a fresher, more balanced woody scent. I think the majority of men will enjoy the scent once it has dried down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fujiyama Homme is definitely a work/casual fragrance. This is not something to wear to something more formal or romantic. I think season-wise you have some more leeway. I would honestly say this fragrance is predominantly for spring and summer, but if you wore it during the start of fall I don&#x27;t think anyone but the cologne connnisuers would give you funny looks. To be fair I wear whatever cologne when I want. The way I see it if you smell nice, you smell nice that&#x27;s it. Granted I won&#x27;t be so keen to pick my Nautica during the chill of December, but hey, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, Fujiyama Homme is worth a shot if you got some extra cash lying around. Fujiyama Homme isn&#x27;t the cream of the crop with colognes by any stretch of the imagination, but it&#x27;s projection and sillage are much stronger than most for its price point; much more so than Gentleman which seems to die somewhat fast but I&#x27;ve owned worse in that regard. I would put Homme around the five hour projection mark, certainly more than four, but six is a bit much. But for ten bucks or so, just re-apply no big deal! Not a shabby scent!ried down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fujiyama Homme is definitely a work/casual fragrance. This is not something to wear to something more formal or romantic.

    <li> yuck yuck, does not smell nice.  I gave it away and don&#x27;t like the smell at all. Will not buy it again. Cheap</li>
    <li> Smells good, fresh...</li>
    <li> just great is all I can say.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. The fragrance does not last long at all it is good for an hour or so not worth the money</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents, my wife really likes it as well, I like more light fruity scents and this one is right there.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it! Smells great on him too. The shipping was excellent, my purchase was delivered on time. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This has a very fruity some what sporty smell to it and is very unique. I love the smell and recommend trying it out if your into fruity sporty smells. I only give it 4 stars because of the duration it lasts. You get about 4 hours tops out of a couple sprays, still a great deal for this price though!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice fragrance. It&#x27;s something that is very soft, but it&#x27;s just enough to carry you throughout most of the day. I will probably order this again.</li>
    <li> Smells extremely good, does ware off though does not last all day.</li>
    <li> 1960/70&#x27;s smelling has to much of a musky smell for me&lt;br /&gt;Good for around the house or yard work&lt;br /&gt;No I would not recommend</li>
    <li> I was shopping on amazon.com for another fragrance, and this scent was listed as a recommendation.  I decided to order it because it was so inexpensive, and I figured I would give it a try.  I would definitely order it again or give it as a gift. It is very light and pleasant - not at all musky, but very clean smelling - fresh and not offensive. When I would wear this, I would get a lot of compliments.  I finished the bottle a while ago - I will eventually order it again.</li>
    <li> Light summer scent thats pleasant and practical.  I enjoy it during the summer for its soft light smell. Great price too.</li>
    <li> OK but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> To bad first shipper never got it to my door.  But that&#x27;s not the products fault.  This fragrance with its citrus scent dissipates fast but I like the cool fresh confidence it gives without concern of being cloying.</li>
    <li> Been a favorite of mine since the late 90s.  Such a clean and fresh scent especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mens cologn on a whim, with no knowledge of the product, but I am so happy. It has a great fresh smelling scent and I got it at a very good price.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for her brother, she opened to make sure this is the right scent for him--not too strong and overpowering. Immediately, she loved the smell and decided to keep for HERSELF and buy another one for her brother. Not a cologne user, but I have to say this is a great fragrance for men even women who likes light perfume.</li>
    <li> Love it the real thing for cheap</li>
    <li> I bought this for the retro-looking bottle to add to my collection. The smell is actually a really crisp, clean smell. I would probably recommend it for anyone that&#x27;s early to mid-20s, but I don&#x27;t see why anyone cannot wear this smell! Definitely smells better than most of those smells aimed at young men.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne because it was cheap and I needed something cheap to make order over $25 for free shipping. I was surprised by how pleasant the smell is. It is subtle, yet lasts longer than I expected. I am quite pleased.</li>
    <li> I saw the price I was kind of spectacle about it I was wondering to myself should I get it just wondering what it smell great fooled me wrongI loved it and my wife love it.and same for me to scent of it too</li>
    <li> Smells good a daily wear, but sent is short lived for the price spray all day</li>
    <li> Fujiyama colognes (or, EDTs) are some most elegant, fresh colognes available on the market. I&#x27;m a big fan of Kenzo and Issey Miyake fragrances and honestly, they are perhaps more elegant and demure. But when you need something that smells fresh and distinct, you&#x27;ll simply not find any fragrance comparable to Fujiyama. Of course this can&#x27;t touch something like Creed Erolfa. The material quality is unmistakable in a high-end fragrance like that. But the Fujiyama fragrances are STUNNING for the price. Check out Green, Gentleman, Private. They are all absolutely subtle, pleasant, and comment-worthy. That&#x27;s a GREAT claim to fame for fragrances in this price range. Buy them, try them and ENJOY!!!</li>
    <li> Smell too muck like alcohol and dont last to long probably 1 hour at the most.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend to no one</li>
    <li> Exquisite fragrance but short-lived. For the cost worth buying. only have to apply a bit more than usual. Ideal for the night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old man that&#x27;s been wearing cologne since I was in middle school and I&#x27;ve tried and own the best colognes since the 80s and let me tell you this hidden gem is awesome yes is cheap but I was blown away by the quality and longevity it is the closest smell to Issey Miyake wich I owned in the past and it cost about 45 to 60 bucks so if you want to spend money to get a name brand go ahead I do that too whe I have the funds, but I&#x27;ve found that nowadays you can find a great cologne at a great price. I used to spend like crazy on colognes when in my 20s and 30s im a cologne fanatic and now my hobby is finding diamonds in the rough of course is not easy but if you&#x27;re careful and do research and read the reviews you can get a great cologne for a great price and trust me this one is a home run!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the product before and I paid 3 time as much as I paid on here! Same product for cheaper and I got it extreamly fast and in great shape!</li>
    <li> Good and cool Fragrance!! It is cheaper. It is worth according with the price. It is a good option for a day-to-day perfume.</li>
    <li> i was disappointed. when i received the package the outside container was intact but the box the cologne came in was wet,  half the cologne leak out of the bottle. after smell the product it was okay but paying for something and getting half the product had me upset so i just tossed it in the trash. i would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the money and I will order a few more for gifts. When I first tried it, it was a great.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling cologne.  One of a variety of colognes I own, my wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend, its fairly cheap too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too strong but it has it&#x27;s unique scent that will make you want to be around a man all day.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve read reviews and decided to give it a try  with the pricing.  i wear calvin clein, versaci, polo, obsession, basically the name brand items. i like cologne that stick after wearing for an several hours or even washing. i am impressed by the smell and can&#x27;t wait to try it on when going out. it has a sweet, clean smell.</li>
    <li> I just love this cologne, it just has a clean, fresh wonderful scent. A light smell not overbearing. My favorite cologne so far.</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly fresh smelling cologne. Got my first bottle for my birthday from a friend and bought another bottle just because. You get a lot for the price and it doesn&#x27;t smell like other colognes that are being sold at this price.</li>
    <li> This is really nice. It arrived so fast. And it smells amazing! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my grandson in high school.  He loves it.  Light, clean fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Smells really awesome... And very affordable👌</li>
    <li> Cool bottle, made in Paris France, ooh la laa!&lt;br /&gt;Ok, there&#x27;s the raves for my one star which is a first for me. Normally because of my nature I have a hard time&lt;br /&gt;rating anything that low. This is not a knock off least wise not where it implies that it smells like something else.&lt;br /&gt;The box was as nice as any name brand, celloed fully, with a quality protective inner structure, I was geared up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray, even and full, same as a Windex bottle, problem was you can smell the Windex but not this! I even sprayed it on my hands aftershave style then patted on my face figuring that close to my nose I would smell it then, nope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever smell a butterfly fart?  Don&#x27;t answer that, I was being rhetorical, no actually I was bing a s/ass!&lt;br /&gt; Rinse your hands in water, pat face, smell....unless your water has a very high mineral count this is the smell you will&lt;br /&gt;get for your $8- free ship with prime.&lt;br /&gt;  I was positive &#x27;Yacht Man&#x27;, (Germany) was the weakest scent other than &#x27;Jean Philippe Paris&#x27;  from the dollar store  for a dollar but amazingly so this beat out both coming in third behind the dollar bottle of  &#x27;Artic Blue&#x27;,{Cool Water k/off} which actually smells really nice if it would last longer than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shame is that I was so cheap to buy this but you can drop big money for weak too; the hint...day scent; translates&lt;br /&gt;usually into light, airy, etc.  Weak is weak, I&#x27;m off to start bidding again on Burberry Brit on the big E, my quest&lt;br /&gt;for cheap but good is over even a beaten dog knows when to give up and this is it!  Syanora Guys &amp; Gals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was going to edit this and try to clean up how it&#x27;s arranged , paragraphs and such but heck the way I wrote it was fine till&lt;br /&gt;it went through the Amazon review tumble and they scattered it all over the place.i This stuff just isn&#x27;t worth the edit, sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note added 3/8/13:  Not changing anything on my review but wanted to mention that a friend, (lady) was over and I told her how irritated I was with my &#x27;water spray&#x27; when she asked to smell it and her Bionic nose liked it so I gave it to her and she was ecstatic,&lt;br /&gt;go figure?  I almost bought the green version of this for a lot more but now I&#x27;m leery for sure. Good day to you....d, (lady) was over and I told her how irritated I was with my &#x27;water spray&#x27; when she asked to smell it and her Bionic nose liked it so I gave it to her and she was ecstatic,&lt;br /&gt;go figure?  I almost bought the green version of this for a lot more but now I&#x27;m leery for sure. Good day to you....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that will totally ignore any negative comments and will focus on the good. This is a good air freshener because it smells ok if you only spray it once. If it&#x27;s overdone, this WILL smell terrible !! On skin, it lasts about 45 minutes! I&#x27;m a decent cologne connoisseur, so I had to see for myself how good/bad this cologne was. I actually think that this is a replica of an Issey Miyake cologne.</li>
