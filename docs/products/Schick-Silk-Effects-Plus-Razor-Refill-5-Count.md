      <li>This was a new, quality product for a great price.</li>
      <li>It is the third time I buy things from this seller, I´m happy with the product. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>This product with its little wires is wonderful for saving the skin.</li>
      <li>My legs feel silky smooth</li>
      <li>I love this razor, I almost never cut myself and rarely get razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They fit a short-handled razor, which I find easier to grip and control.</li>
      <li>good for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>They have excellent longevity, so at less than $1.50 a razor, it&#x27;s quite a deal!</li>
      <li>The razor is an old model, but fits my hand perfectly -- I love it, and was so glad to find these.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice that Amazon offers auto-shipment of these</li>
      <li>The razor is perfect for delicate skin and areas that are prone to breaking out in a rash.</li>
      <li>These refill cartridges fit exactly right.</li>
      <li>The shaving industry has come out with many new razors and gadgets but why switch when this works so well?  </li>
      <li>Blades were authentic and new in box.</li>
      <li>This is by far, my favorite razor refill.  </li>
      <li>I rarely cut my legs when using them.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use them but bought these to try something a bit more economical than some of the other choices and have been told by the person I bought them for that they work fine.</li>
      <li>I bought the Silk effects plus razor a few months ago and I am very happy with the razor especially the bikini area.  </li>
      <li>They do the job, and the handle of the razor is more comfortable to me than any other that I have tried.</li>
      <li>My mother gave me the razor handle when I first started shaving</li>
      <li>I love these blades and especially the razor that goes with it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for allowing me to purchase online!</li>
      <li>Nothing else was this good and was always a waste of money.</li>
      <li>The Schick Silk Effects Razor is so very useful and far too underrated.  </li>
      <li>The price was good, love this product, seems is getting difficult to get them in the stores, If I will keep finding them online</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it pretty much since they came out.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re getting harder and harder to find in the stores, so this 2 pack is a great find to keep me in stock at a better price than a single pack I have to hunt for before finding in the store.</li>
      <li>Finally the light went on in my brain.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really use these.</li>
      <li>This company is very prompt in sending your merchandise.</li>
      <li>This type of razor refill is getting extremely difficult to find in local stores and I am so happy to be able to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The 2-pack will last me a while and hopefully will still be available when I need to order again.</li>
      <li>I just wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much.  </li>
      <li>and now I have a nice little stock pile and it didn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg!</li>
      <li>So in short, i saved a good amount over what I would have paid locally and I got the same thing.</li>
      <li>I ordered the double pack, and they arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Product has high quality.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Not having any direct experience with the product I am estimating at 4 stars but realize there might very well be variation of plus/minus 1 star.</li>
      <li>I decided to go ahead and purchase new blades.  </li>
      <li>The order was complete with product specified in ad.  </li>
      <li>The razors are probably really good, just my mistake of buying the wrong one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried some others and though they work, these blades cost half as much and work as well!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these razor blades to anyone who is on the fence - they last a long time.</li>

<li> I have been using these blades for a long time.  </li>
<li> I like the razor and hate to try a new one because there are so many to choose.</li>
<li> Whereas, the other ladies razors that I have tried, I will get stubble the next day and have to shave every day!</li>
<li> Actually, these may be Discontinued and are getting harder and harder to find.</li>
<li> As one previous reviewer stated, local stores (like CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens) seem to have stopped carrying these refills.</li>
<li> Not much else to write.</li>
<li> but there&#x27;s not much to say about them.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t cut myself like I do with other razors.</li>
<li> All these other razors with 3-4-5 blades give me ingrown hairs.  </li>
<li> Having a hard time finding these in the local stores, so found them here!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find a basic razor anymore.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t use any \\&quot;normal\\&quot; razor in the delicate upper leg/bikini area without a rash.</li>
<li> I have been using Schick Silk Effects for at least ten years.</li>
<li> 10 blades for less than $1.50 each.</li>
<li> With the high price of razor blades at the stores today, I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> The difference with this razor are the little wires that go over the blades to help prevent nics and cuts.</li>
<li> When you try and buy these shavers at the local Walgreens or CVS, the price is too expensive for 5 cartridges.  </li>
<li> It is difficult to find these locally.  </li>
<li> However, over the past couple of years I have been unable to find the refills in my local national discount drug stores.</li>

    <li> The order was complete with product specified in ad.  Product met my specifications.  I&#x27;ve used product successfully.  Product has high quality.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these blades in stores any more. The razor is an old model, but fits my hand perfectly -- I love it, and was so glad to find these.</li>
    <li> I have two Schick Silk Effects Razors - one for home and one for travel - that I have used for years and years and love. I rarely cut my legs when using them. However, over the past couple of years I have been unable to find the refills in my local national discount drug stores. Finally the light went on in my brain. I figured if there is anywhere I could find them it would be on Amazon. I looked, and I found them. I ordered the double pack, and they arrived quickly. Lesson learned: whenever your cannot find a product in a store, be sure and check for it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> So happy I found these, they stopped carrying them in stores and now I have a nice little stock pile and it didn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg!</li>
    <li> Buy online, the value is better and you get more.  When you try and buy these shavers at the local Walgreens or CVS, the price is too expensive for 5 cartridges.  Item on Amazon was a great deal because you get 2 for the price of one.  Way to go Amazon.  Great product representation.</li>
    <li> Having a hard time finding these in the local stores, so found them here! I love these blades as I don&#x27;t cut myself with them. They fit a short-handled razor, which I find easier to grip and control. Like the lubricated strip with aloe too.</li>
    <li> Blades were authentic and new in box. Not much else to write. Price was good. So in short, i saved a good amount over what I would have paid locally and I got the same thing. Actually, these may be Discontinued and are getting harder and harder to find.</li>
    <li> Schick Silk Effects Plus 5 count X 2 is a great product at a perfect price. I have used this razor for 15 years (or more) and I am extremely pleased with the results. I hope they never take this razor off the market.</li>
    <li> I have been using Schick Silk Effects for at least ten years. For a while it was hard to find the razors, and I was worried they weren&#x27;t making them anymore. I love this razor, I almost never cut myself and rarely get razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that Amazon offers auto-shipment of these so I don&#x27;t forget to order more!</li>
    <li> The Schick Silk Effects Razor is so very useful and far too underrated.  I&#x27;m happy to be able to purchase the refills on Amazon. I realize this review is for the refills but there&#x27;s not much to say about them. The razor is perfect for delicate skin and areas that are prone to breaking out in a rash. I use this razor for my bikini area and my armpits. I use a different razor for my legs for a closer shave. The difference with this razor are the little wires that go over the blades to help prevent nics and cuts. This is also a perfect razor for a tween just learning. I hope they never discontinue this razor! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors - I&#x27;ve been using them for years. They&#x27;re getting harder and harder to find in the stores, so this 2 pack is a great find to keep me in stock at a better price than a single pack I have to hunt for before finding in the store.</li>

The 2-pack will last me a while and hopefully will still be available when I need to order again.</li>
    <li> I am so glad there is a company that I can still buy these blades. I like the razor and hate to try a new one because there are so many to choose. There is no store in our area carrying this merchandise.  This company is very prompt in sending your merchandise.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I was able to find these on Amazon.  I have been searching every store in my area for the refills and they are nowhere to be found.  This is the only razor that does not give me razor nicks or stubble.  I can go 3 days without shaving and will not get razor stubble on my legs. Whereas, the other ladies razors that I have tried, I will get stubble the next day and have to shave every day! Not with Schick Silk Effects!  Leaves my legs very smooth!</li>
    <li> I have been using these razor blades for years and years now (about 10 years), and I love them! When you subscribe and save on Amazon it&#x27;s cheaper than anywhere else I&#x27;ve found - Walmart, Target, etc. I highly recommend these razor blades to anyone who is on the fence - they last a long time.</li>
    <li> I like to buy these blades in quantity to save money and could not do so in town. As described.</li>
    <li> This type of razor refill is getting extremely difficult to find in local stores and I am so happy to be able to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is by far, my favorite razor refill.  I&#x27;ve been using it pretty much since they came out.  My legs feel silky smooth and I don&#x27;t cut myself like I do with other razors. I just wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much.  I&#x27;ll be devastated if they every get discontinued.</li>
    <li> good for sensitive skin--so glad that Amazon still has these razor blades available!</li>
    <li> I bought the Silk effects plus razor a few months ago and I am very happy with the razor especially the bikini area.  I decided to go ahead and purchase new blades.  I would give the razor a try and see what you think.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The price was good, love this product, seems is getting difficult to get them in the stores, If I will keep finding them online I will keep buying them here in Amazon</li>
    <li> This was a new, quality product for a great price. It&#x27;s hard to find them in stores anymore. Received it very quickly!</li>
    <li> This model razor has been obsolete for several years so, you&#x27;d think, the blades would cost next to nothing but, you still have to pay a premium.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor awhile and could not find refills in the store any more.  Thanks for allowing me to purchase online!</li>
    <li> Works and what I needed.  Could no longer find them in stores.  Thank goodness I was able to get them here.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find these locally.  I like my schick silk effects razor and hope I will be able to keep purchasing these blades online.</li>
    <li> I love these razors.  They have been my favorite for years.  I have tried the more expensive brands, but I always end up coming back to these.  They do the job, and the handle of the razor is more comfortable to me than any other that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for a long time.  The shaving industry has come out with many new razors and gadgets but why switch when this works so well?  I&#x27;ve tried some others and though they work, these blades cost half as much and work as well!  I never cut myself with these while getting a close shave.  I hope they stay on the market forever.</li>
    <li> Bought the wrong blades for my razor I couldn&#x27;t really use these. The razors are probably really good, just my mistake of buying the wrong one.</li>
    <li> These are great razor blades.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a long time.</li>
    <li> I buy this from here because of the great price and value.  I don&#x27;t have to go through the hassle of searching in stores for this.</li>
    <li> I use the Silk Effects razor as my travel razor; it has a larger handle, and is easier for me to hold when I&#x27;m in showers away from home.  These refill cartridges fit exactly right.</li>
    <li> Purchased this by mistake.  Thought it was for a different razor; never used them so I have nothing to rate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Silk Effects forever. I can&#x27;t use any \\&quot;normal\\&quot; razor in the delicate upper leg/bikini area without a rash. This product with its little wires is wonderful for saving the skin. I&#x27;m glad I can find them on Amazon! I&#x27;m going to write Schick and ask them to never discontinue making these. (-:</li>
    <li> I love these razor refills for my schick razor.  Been using these since I was a teenager.  All these other razors with 3-4-5 blades give me ingrown hairs.  It&#x27;s hard to find a basic razor anymore.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the best razor ever!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use them but bought these to try something a bit more economical than some of the other choices and have been told by the person I bought them for that they work fine. Not having any direct experience with the product I am estimating at 4 stars but realize there might very well be variation of plus/minus 1 star.</li>
    <li> Another Silk Effects lifer here. My mother gave me the razor handle when I first started shaving (I want to say about seventeen years ago... Gosh has it been that long?) and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since. That is until these razors started disappearing from shelves in the drug stores and was forced to try others. Nothing else was this good and was always a waste of money. Even my husband uses them now! They have excellent longevity, so at less than $1.50 a razor, it&#x27;s quite a deal!</li>
    <li> I love these blades and especially the razor that goes with it.  These blades are long-lasting and shave closely with cutting.</li>
    <li> It is the third time I buy things from this seller, I´m happy with the product. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I expect these will be the same as the blades I used to purchase in stores, same brand, style, packaging. I am stocking up....cannot find in stores. Good price, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
