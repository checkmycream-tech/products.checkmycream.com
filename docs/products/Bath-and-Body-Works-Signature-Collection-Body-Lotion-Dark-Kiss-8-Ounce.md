      <li>I kind of agree but still like it.</li>
      <li>The lotion smells great, but doesn&#x27;t really work good as a lotion.</li>
      <li>:) Thank you! :)</li>

      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>Was glad to find this on Amazon...one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I rather just let it sit and put on something more fresher.</li>
      <li>:&gt;)</li>
      <li>Excellent product with a very different and pleasing fragrance</li>
      <li>great fragrance Shipped fast</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>Lasts through the day without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Kiss is wonderful, enticing, mysterious.</li>
      <li>I cant tell you how many times Ive gotten laid from using this.</li>
      <li>and I think I was going to love this lotion</li>
      <li>I am in love with this scent.</li>
      <li>I wear it all the time, but I feel like it smells better in the fall.</li>
      <li>; A wonderful body lotion for general use and I certainly recommend it; (This review was from my wife who had me order this product and was very glad she did!)&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
      <li>When I first got it i loved it.</li>
      <li>Very good, but it takes long time to reach.</li>
      <li>The dark Kiss lotion is an excellent choice for me</li>
      <li>This is a really good new scent from B&amp;B.</li>
      <li>, the quite one just think I&#x27;m gay  .</li>
      <li>The scent is light &amp; seems to be a crowd pleaser.</li>
      <li>A lady is a woman who is most diligently kept, reserved, funny, excitingly witty and extraordinarily accustomed to the ways of properness.</li>
      <li>This one I think would be labeled as my ultimate favorite! :)</li>
      <li>It is either sweet to the death or woody to the death or clean and fresh...to the death.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite scent by BBW.</li>
      <li>It has a sweet fruity smell.</li>
      <li>It is however not too sweet smelling and is not over powering.</li>
      <li>I know I sound like a paid advertisement right now,</li>
      <li>I do like this fragrance, it&#x27;s fun and unique.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a dude, I don&#x27;t know how best to explain the subtle glory of this.  </li>
      <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t stay sickly sweet, it changes into a more romantic, calm tenderness after about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, if you do not like sweet fragrances like Vanilla (before Dark Kiss, Warm Vanilla Sugar was my favorite BBW</li>
      <li>It just doesnt smell fresh to me.</li>
      <li>It does come off very strongly as a sweet scent at first.</li>
      <li>(smile)</li>
      <li>As soon as I smelled this, I knew it was the right one.</li>
      <li>It is definitely the kind of scent you want to wear at night, but during the day it takes on a more candy like characteristic.</li>
      <li>Well, it smells mellow and sexy at the same time.</li>
      <li>Where her husband does not mind her being &amp;#34;showy&amp;#34;, if she is indeed married.</li>
      <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>purchased this for her as she loves it, sadly no pants access has been granted.  </li>
      <li>she was and still a loyal customer but was surprised about it .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sooooo good and last long</li>
      <li>Very seductive.</li>
      <li>this is a real loss.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t give you much room for imagination and exploration.</li>
      <li>Normally Bath and Body Works product are too fruity or flowery for my taste, but I really like this one!</li>
      <li>As we know, some BBS items are only available once or perhaps twice annually.  </li>
      <li>It is not a simple sweet or woody smell.</li>
      <li>Usually I have a strong sense of smell and always chooses the right one.</li>
      <li>In fact, I got the whole set - lotion, spray, body wash- for 25 bucks when it first came out during Christmas last year.</li>
      <li>In fact, I got the whole set - lotion, spray, body wash- for 25 bucks when it first came out during Christmas last year.</li>
      <li>I will continue using this fragrance, and it will be the only consistent BBW product I use.</li>
      <li>I will continue using this fragrance, and it will be the only consistent BBW product I use.</li>
      <li>I think itd probably smell better during the fall or the winter though because its very heavy and seductive smelling.</li>
      <li>The lotion really stings when you apply it to dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize.</li>
      <li>If you are lucky to find it and get it, do so because it was in stores for a limited  time only</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would classify the smell though, to be about betrayal, more like seduction, but subtly so.</li>
      <li>Not Dark Kiss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, it is great that Amazon usually has a lot of these hard to find fragrances all year long.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, this is my absolute favorite out of anything that has come out of BBW for the past few years!</li>
      <li>A woman, not necessarily a promiscuis one, just a woman who is not afraid to let her hair down once in a while.</li>
      <li>In short, I feel like most of their fragrances are not sophisticated enough for someone who has experimented with a wide range of products.</li>

    <li> Was given to me as a gift somewhat since my friend who loved the scent did not like it and it make her skin break out. scent had faded over time . Was not complete waste when it came down to it , but at the same time its a B&amp;BW product so I was surprised when she broke out she was and still a loyal customer but was surprised about it .</li>
    <li> This is a really good new scent from B&amp;B. It has a sweet fruity smell. One day, When I wore it, a clerk said it smelled like cotton candy. :&gt;) I kind of agree but still like it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a large amount of BBW products over the past 5 years, during which I was obsessed with finding the right scent for me. As soon as I smelled this, I knew it was the right one. The thing about BBW is that they are very black and white with their fragrances. It is either sweet to the death or woody to the death or clean and fresh...to the death. Not much in between. They don&#x27;t give you much room for imagination and exploration. In short, I feel like most of their fragrances are not sophisticated enough for someone who has experimented with a wide range of products. Not Dark Kiss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Kiss is wonderful, enticing, mysterious. If you smell it and pause a moment to reflect, it smells exactly like a dark kiss, if a dark kiss had a smell. If that statement perplexes you, you should try it for yourself and then you will know what I mean. I know I sound like a paid advertisement right now, but I&#x27;m just telling the truth. I would not give a scent 5 stars if it did not deserve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Kiss requires your interpretation. It is not a simple sweet or woody smell. It navigates between sickly sweetness, tenderness, heavy woods and a slight hint of fruit. Very seductive. It is hard to explain. I wear this to sleep and have nice dreams. It is definitely the kind of scent you want to wear at night, but during the day it takes on a more candy like characteristic. It makes me feel optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you do not like sweet fragrances like Vanilla (before Dark Kiss, Warm Vanilla Sugar was my favorite BBW and I was getting sick of that), Apple Pie, and the likes, you probably would not enjoy Dark Kiss. It does come off very strongly as a sweet scent at first. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t stay sickly sweet, it changes into a more romantic, calm tenderness after about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is my absolute favorite out of anything that has come out of BBW for the past few years! If you are like me, and have tried a lot of fragrances, you should definitely give this a try. In fact, I got the whole set - lotion, spray, body wash- for 25 bucks when it first came out during Christmas last year. It was a great buy. I will continue using this fragrance, and it will be the only consistent BBW product I use. It never annoys me like their other scents eventually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!this a try.

    <li> This is my absolute favorite scent by BBW. A lot of people have complimented me on it and tell me I smell like cotton candy. It is however not too sweet smelling and is not over powering. Lasts through the day without being overwhelming. I actaully cannot wear perfume because of the headache factor from the stron smell. I can wear this lotion with a light spritz of the Darlk Kiss body spray and it is perfect.</li>
    <li> When I first got it i loved it. I loved how it was more Gothic looking, and the smell was sweet but sexy. But i got tired of it fast it started giving me terrible headaches (migraines). So unfortunately i can&#x27;t wear this anymore. So for people that get Migraines i would not recommend this product to.</li>
    <li> every morning i put a big john holmes wad in my hair and all over my face.  chicks say,&amp;#34;damn you smell good&amp;#34;. Ive had a lot of those over the years, the quite one just think I&#x27;m gay  . this stops my scalp from crawling all day, probably good for my skin as well.  switch up with midnight pomegranate</li>
    <li> It has that smell like it has been sitting for a long time. It just doesnt smell fresh to me. IT still does the job but its just not the same. To be honest I don&#x27;t wear it. I use to wear it all the time when I would buy it from B&amp;BW but I bought 3 and wont wear it. I rather just let it sit and put on something more fresher.</li>
    <li> I love this body cream and get many compliments as to how great it smells!</li>
    <li> I see the comments and I think I was going to love this lotion but it was not the case, nota a good fragance for me, I dont like</li>
    <li> This got strong perfume kind fragrance sometime it brings headache. And not refreshing and sadly got a body mist from this collection which is also very candy. All together I didn&#x27;t like this one. Usually I have a strong sense of smell and always chooses the right one. But this I bought it through reading recommendations which I regret now.</li>
    <li> great fragrance Shipped fast</li>
    <li> Dark kiss! Who comes up with these names for fragrances? A bit prejudice, don&#x27;t you think?! (smile) Well, it smells mellow and sexy at the same time. A kiss in the dark can be sensual or scary. Judas betrayed the Son of Man with a kiss. I don&#x27;t know if I would classify the smell though, to be about betrayal, more like seduction, but subtly so. Definitely not fitting for a lady, like Christian Dior Dolce La Vita. Nah, this is definitely woman quality stuff. ;) A woman, not necessarily a promiscuis one, just a woman who is not afraid to let her hair down once in a while. Where her husband does not mind her being &amp;#34;showy&amp;#34;, if she is indeed married. A lady is a woman who is most diligently kept, reserved, funny, excitingly witty and extraordinarily accustomed to the ways of properness. Women can pull of being a lady just as well, it is our nature, but not with this fragrance. LOL. I am indeed being silly. I do like this fragrance, it&#x27;s fun and unique.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the one I bought from bath &amp; body works few years ago</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude, I don&#x27;t know how best to explain the subtle glory of this.  All i know is my co-worker puts it on, and I want in her pants.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for her as she loves it, sadly no pants access has been granted.  Still working on that.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells great, but doesn&#x27;t really work good as a lotion. The lotion really stings when you apply it to dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize.</li>
    <li> As we know, some BBS items are only available once or perhaps twice annually.  So, it is great that Amazon usually has a lot of these hard to find fragrances all year long.  My Granddaughter claims this as her favorite lotion, and I was so happy I could surprise her with it during her adjustment time when away from home for the first time.  It spelled &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with a very different and pleasing fragrance; A wonderful body lotion for general use and I certainly recommend it; (This review was from my wife who had me order this product and was very glad she did!)&lt;br /&gt;Mike in Alamo.</li>
    <li> I used this scent since 2013! My new roommate always asked me what perfume i use, and we figured out that was not a perfume, but BBW dark kiss. It&#x27;s sooooo good and last long</li>
    <li> I love bath &amp; body works lotion and spray! This one I think would be labeled as my ultimate favorite! :)</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. The fragrance lasts forever. I wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it in the store. Now we can only get in online.</li>
    <li> This lotion is Awesome the scent is so Wonderful and Sexy unfortunately I believe it&#x27;s been discontinue at Bath &amp; Body this is a real loss.</li>
    <li> magical, whimsical, enchanting, alluring... intoxicating...perfect name for this lotion</li>
    <li> LOVE this body lotionnn! Great job on the delivery of the product! :) Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> Great scent. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very good, but it takes long time to reach.</li>
    <li> i got it for my girlfriend for valentines day and she had thought you couldn&#x27;t find it anymore so she loved it its perfect</li>
    <li> The dark Kiss lotion is an excellent choice for me I used it before and I love it I would recommend this lotion to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent! Normally Bath and Body Works product are too fruity or flowery for my taste, but I really like this one! It does have a slight berry scent, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. The Vanilla, Amber and Incense tones shine through the berry for a truly delightful scent!!!</li>
    <li> Was glad to find this on Amazon...one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> Received this lotion as a gift &amp; every single time I wore it I got complimented.  So of course I had to order 4 bottles myself.  The scent is light &amp; seems to be a crowd pleaser.</li>
    <li> This product purchase was for my wife, quen uses this line of beauty products for several years. She is fascinated</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! I cant tell you how many times Ive gotten laid from using this. Guys say I smell amazing, almost \\&quot;too good\\&quot;. I put it on after I bathe and I come home from 12 hours of work and I still smell like it. I think itd probably smell better during the fall or the winter though because its very heavy and seductive smelling. I wear it all the time, but I feel like it smells better in the fall.</li>
    <li> This was the very best , why did they have to discontinue the scent!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter - she loves it.</li>
    <li> Smells so good i love it</li>
    <li> think it get lost, The product never come, iwas a gif and i have to ask this week to my cousin but she told me that she never got it</li>
    <li> I am in love with this scent. If you are lucky to find it and get it, do so because it was in stores for a limited  time only and they dont have it anymore. Totally recommend it!!!</li>
