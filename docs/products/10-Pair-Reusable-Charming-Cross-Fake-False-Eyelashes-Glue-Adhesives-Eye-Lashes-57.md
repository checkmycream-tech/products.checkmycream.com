    <li> It is not natural looking! These look big and crazy!</li>
    <li> They were okay. They&#x27;re kind of plasticy, but then again that is what I expected to receive since they are from China. The lash band is very thick, but you defiantly can work with them. The lash style didn&#x27;t suit my eyes so I just gave them to a friend. Overall they were decent and I would re-purchase them if they were a different style.</li>
    <li> Do this have a glue with it?</li>
    <li> I never took my lashes off since I put em on and I also sleep with them on and they don&#x27;t bend or go out of place</li>
    <li> Beautiful perfect length lashes. The hair feels nice and soft and they are so easy to blend in. Perfect eyelashes for a glamorous look, perfect day to day eyelashes for someone who likes them big, I don&#x27;t think they are natural that is why I love them. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE!! IN the picture, they look more like they start small in the inner corners then get bigger on the outside, which I LOOOOVE!! But THEY DONT DO THAT AT ALL. They are more rounded..meaning they are small on the outer corners and the biggest part is in the middle.</li>
    <li> The shipping on these lashes took for-evvver!  If I would have known this I would have just gone to the drugstore to buy some.  They weren&#x27;t very flexible either. Very stiff on my eyes.</li>
