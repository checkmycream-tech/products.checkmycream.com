    <li> I love this Basic Instinct Parfum love the smell feels good on the skin need I say more. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this parfum. Was discontinued at Victoia&#x27;s Secret store so I was very happy I could purchase it through Amazon.😀</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have purchased this perfume many times. I had to order online as Victoria Secret does not sell it in the store any longer.  Item was shipped intact and on time.</li>
    <li> Very happy w purchase</li>
    <li> This will always be one of my favorite fragances... Loved it.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the product and how quickly it was delivered to me. I hope this product remains available for a lifetime because I will continue to order from them everytime. The product was packaged securely and the presentation was impecible, Love it!</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM WAS HARD TO FIND SINCE IT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. I AM THRILLED TO GET IT I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I CHECK AMAZON FIRST ALWAYS. SAVES ME TIME. AND SHIPPING WITH PRIME.</li>
    <li> The perfume not only arrived in perfect condition, but it came a lot sooner than expected. Great service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great receiving all the Basic Instinct product at Amazon.com. I received the product before the shipment arrival date, and the best part it comes right to my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve being using the parfum spray and lotion together for a while now. They do not have the same lasting fragrance as the ones I bought from the Victoria&#x27;s Secret store. Before, you could smell the fragrance all day. My co-workers would always acknowledge the fact how great the smell was all day. Strangers would walk up to me and say what are you wearing? I would hang my coat in the closet at the end of the day the fragrance yet so faintly is still there. No,it&#x27;s was no over kill on the perfume. For some reason the fragrance does not last as long.</li>
    <li> I have worn this product for years and was devastated when it was discontinued by the company.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly as many scents do and I have received the most amazing compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I will be able to purchase it again somehow in the not-too-distant future!</li>
    <li> I started wearing this in 2004. It was the first perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn and I still love it to death.</li>
    <li> The box was sealed I am assumed kept in a warehouse. The  box was dusty. When we opened it, the bottle had been in storage too long and smelled like alcohol. I do have do say I didn&#x27;t give them a chance to fix the problem which I would be more than happy too..</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years ago. I bought 3 bottles because they were on sale and cheap. I don&#x27;t like the smell at all because it&#x27;s way too strong for me. However, another friend of mine likes it and it smells better on her. I ended up selling this at the garage sale for $3 each because I didn&#x27;t know it was discontinued and cost this much on here.</li>
    <li> Love this Fragrance. I was very disappointed when they discontinue it. I wish Victoria\\&quot;s Secret pick it back up again.</li>
    <li> The Basic Instinct Eau De Parfum Spray is one of my favor cologne. I first purchase it on base at the PX at Ft. Benning, GA. I love the smell on my body then and I still love it now.  I wish you would bring it back to Columbus, GA, Ft. Benning, GA or Opelika, AL.</li>
    <li> this is the only perfume a good friend of mine will wear. It&#x27;s getting a little harder to come across it, and the prices seem to go right with that. I was watching Ebay auctions and saw the prices for this, and this was the better deal. Fast, easy, and made her happy</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Glad to find it on Amazon as it has long been discontinued at Victoria&#x27;s Secrets</li>
    <li> I like this perfume! It was easy to find the best price from so many sellers! I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this perfume. I get so many compliments on this one. I wear a little of the lotion (which I ordered too) it enhances the perfume to make a wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this perfume.  It is not heavy but very clean smelling to me.  It&#x27;s my favorite and my everyday &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; perfume.</li>
    <li> It smells so radically different on each woman, so much you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you and your friend are wearing the same scent.  That&#x27;s because it has so many sides to it scent.  This is one of the most versatile day wear scents I wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ADORE walking around smelling wonderful...</li>
    <li> When I bought this perfume I loved it. Next year that I went to Victoria&#x27;s Secret store at the mall to buy it again I didn&#x27;t find it they told me that they had discontinued it. I felt sad so I started to look for it in the internet and I found it on your website. I ordered 3 big bottles just in case you ran out of it, my husband loves the way it smells on me. Thank you so much and I&#x27;ve been ordering other items I love your prices.</li>
    <li> The smell lasts all day, my mom is in love with his perfume. She gets compliments on it left and right, because of this I brought her another bottle for Christmas.</li>
    <li> The experience relating to my latest purchase can be summoned up in one word:  Perfect..  The order went smoothly, the delivery was quickly, and the quality was excellent.. Thank you..</li>
    <li> This case is as pictured but looks even more beautiful in person. i love it very much,,,,i i i i</li>
    <li> This Item was easily found, order easily placed. The Item shipped out just a day or two after I ordered it and it arrived on time and in perfect new condition, just like the image showed online - no problems at all!</li>
    <li> About five yrs ago I found this fragrance at Victoria&#x27;s Secret and shortly afterwards VS discontinued this product and you could only find it maybe once or twice a yr and those old were lucky if you beat the people that go in and buy 10-15 bottles at a time. Animals! So needless to say after my last purchase at VS I accidentally dropped my almost full bottle of basic instinct and thought I would have to wait till the silly inconvenient semi annual event took place but thanks to Amazon.com and stores I don&#x27;t have to wait and my perfume arrived today and it smells better then ever.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. I have been wearing this fragrance for years. People are always asking what it is. Such a shame Victoria&#x27;s Secret discontinued it. I love it!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfume is great I have worn it for years. I only gave two stars because I ordered two bottles received one about a week later.  It took about a month and a couple of e- mails to finally get the second bottle.</li>
    <li> my all time favourite perfume</li>
    <li> I was so sad when it was discontinued years ago....but super glad when I found out there were still vendors that carried it! This is the one perfume I constantly get compliments on.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT....Nothing else to say. My favorite smell/purfume. Victoria Secret&#x27;s no longers sells it which sucks. But happy I can find it online on Amazon. Never had an issue when ordering purfumes. CLW</li>
    <li> Nice fragance. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I worked at VS during the holiday season when this fragrance hit the shelves.  I loved it then and I love it now!  I&#x27;m so disappointed that VS discontinued this fragrance line.  Which means I&#x27;m not gonna have to wear old lady perfume one day instead of this delicious fragrance... Ha!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really smell the fragrance scent like it smelled in store, but my husband seems to love the scent on me..it drives him crazy!!!!</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Good product.</li>
    <li> So glad to find this they discontinued it in the store and I love this Parfume. will continue to order on line</li>
    <li> Love love love this scent...can not purchase at Victoria&#x27;s Secret anymore ..... Was real happy to find it. ... ...</li>
    <li> Best ever.  Not sold in VS anymore have to order on line.  The package did arrive quickly however there was postage due</li>
    <li> I love the perfume and the service was great, I would definitely use this provider again. Can&#x27;t wait for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> One of my faves and they discontinued it in the stores.  Hubby researched and found it here. Surprised me for my b-day.  So happy!</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume a lot. It arrived in perfect condition. Though it seemed to take longer than was originally stated. I would definitely buy this perfume again.</li>
    <li> Good ítem, discontinued on retail stores</li>
    <li> This is an old product. While it smells good, it comes out in VS stores twice a year for $12 . It does smell okay it&#x27;s just that as a VS employee for this price you can get this and several other yummy fragrances! Be smart shoppers ;)</li>
    <li> I love this parfum! I liked it 10 years ago, but it impressed me so much that I remembered it name, an found it on amazon! for very good price, thanks Amazon for that</li>
    <li> Thanks ,this is my favorite purchase</li>
    <li> I started wearing this perfume when Victoria&#x27;s Secret carried it and was devastated when they discontinued the product.  This has been my favorite perfume!  I can&#x27;t count the number of compliments, from men and women, that I receive everytime I wear it!  I have tried in vain to find a perfume in my local stores that compares to Basic Instinct.  I am thrilled to find that Amazon is selling this product!!!!  So excited to finally find this perfume, I can&#x27;t wait to get it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon Basic Instinct is one of my favourite perfumes I was introduced to the product five years age while living in Dubai&lt;br /&gt;I really missed it when my bottle ran out and I couldnt find it here in Australia what a great find to see that Amazon now supplies this great perfume it has such a suttle and delicious smell&lt;br /&gt;thanks again</li>
    <li> I bought this because my cousin had and I smelled it, I thought I was in heaven so I ordered it.  It did not smell nothing like what my cousin had.  I made me nauseous and I did not use it after the first spray.  I guess if it&#x27;s not from VS it&#x27;s no good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. Seller was good, the perfume came fast, but it was my fault because I don&#x27;t like the smell :(</li>
    <li> This has been my all time favorite scent ever! Even though Victoria&#x27;s Secret quit making it, just being able to have access is good. I wear the lotion much more frequent than the spray.</li>
    <li> I love the perfume. My daughter, who is now deceased, use to wear this fragrance, so now when I wear it, it reminds me of her. Hope you never discontinue this fragrance.</li>
    <li> PACKAGE EXCELLENT AND ON TIME DELIVERY</li>
    <li> This fragrance made its debut and exited very quickly for some reason . Always get complements and love. Nice to be able to find it again. I would say it is a cool, spicy, sexy, floral. There is something very unusual about this one.</li>
    <li> They should have named this perfume &amp;#34;Very Sexy&amp;#34; because that is the way it smells. I get tons of compliments EVERY time I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume!! I try to keep it at all times!! I love it because everyone wants it and no one can find it and its one I just cant share!!</li>
    <li> Love this cologne that Victoria Secret no longer carries. Not a heavy floral scent, but, sexy with a fresh scent that can be worn anytime of the day.</li>
    <li> Recepient was delighted that I found her beloved fragrance. She is absolutely wild about it. She hates that she cannot find the body wash in the same fragrance.</li>
    <li> very good!! love the perfume plus the shipping was fast</li>
