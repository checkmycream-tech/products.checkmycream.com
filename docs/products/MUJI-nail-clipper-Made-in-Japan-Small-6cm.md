      <li>The cut is so clean I do not have to file away the ragged edges, and no nails go flying.</li>
      <li>I also like to clean my clippers and found when doing</li>
      <li>What was described is true.</li>
      <li>, they cost more than the drugstore version, but man, these things cut way better, and are built to last.</li>
      <li>Products arrived quickly and were packaged well.  </li>
      <li>These clippers provide a pretty clean cut of the nail</li>

      <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure able spending so much for clipper, but they really are a step above the cheap ones.</li>

      <li>Nice sharp cut.</li>
      <li>It is in the way at the edges of the blades such that you can&#x27;t get to the corners of your nails easily.</li>
      <li>The clippers are pretty decent without the catcher installed but aren&#x27;t life changing.</li>
      <li>Very high quality build</li>
      <li>/&gt;Stocking stuffers for my whole family.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Nails much healthier with this rather than nail file.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s from Japan, because it says so on the wrapper, but it&#x27;s not stamped on the clipper, and it lacks the thoughtful packaging and finish I&#x27;ve come to expect of Japanese products of all kinds.  </li>
      <li>These cut very well compared to drug store nail clippers.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a large opening for getting cuticles from weird angles, but the cut is great.</li>
      <li>The file is built into the lever and of much better quality than the separate file beneath the lever typical of over the clippers.</li>
      <li>I have pretty strong nails, and these things clip through with little to no effort.</li>
      <li>Even the price is not that high, considering you&#x27;ll have these things for years.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>Like most guys, I only buy nail clippers if (a) my current ones are completely rusted out; or (b) I&#x27;m traveling</li>
      <li>Sharp and precise.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>They are sharp, so the cuts are clean.</li>
      <li>Wow, sharpest nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I have zero regrets purchasing these, and I honestly can&#x27;t think of a negative.</li>
      <li>Probably the best cutting small clippers I&#x27;ve used, would buy again.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money as this clipper will last you a long long time.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer stated, it probably won&#x27;t be a life-changing purchase, for better or worse, unless you accidentally swallow it.</li>
      <li>About as good as my much less expensive Revlon clipper when it was new.  </li>
      <li>typical of other fine Japanese made nail clippers.</li>

<li> Wish they weren&#x27;t so ugly though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wow, so impressed with this product. It looks beautiful, feels solid, and performs like a champ. Like most guys, I only buy nail clippers if (a) my current ones are completely rusted out; or (b) I&#x27;m traveling and I forgot to cut my nails before I left. In this case, it was option (a). Since I&#x27;m almost 40, I figured it was time to buy some grown-man type products that were built to last. These little clippers deliver that and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they cost more than the drugstore version, but man, these things cut way better, and are built to last. I have pretty strong nails, and these things clip through with little to no effort. I have zero regrets purchasing these, and I honestly can&#x27;t think of a negative. Even the price is not that high, considering you&#x27;ll have these things for years. If they fail or problems come up, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review. Until then, buy yourself one of these bad boys.</li>
    <li> I got this because I wanted to have one for the car - to use on kiddos and my fingers as I noticed problems. I like the built in file on the underside of the clipper arm. It doesn&#x27;t have a large opening for getting cuticles from weird angles, but the cut is great.</li>
    <li> good price fast dlivery</li>
    <li> I agree, throw away any other clippers, these are the best.  The handle stays where you put it without swiveling around.  Nothing slips when you&#x27;re using them.  That&#x27;s nice.  Also, the clipper part is lined up and sharp, so it works like it should.  There is not the nail file part that some other clippers have, but I never use that anyway.  It just gets in the way.  This one doesn&#x27;t have that.  The clippers come with a plastic sleeve.  I don&#x27;t know what that is for, but it is removable.  Finally, I&#x27;ve been looking for many years, this one is the one.</li>
    <li> Love this nail clipper!</li>
    <li> Good. Works as expected. Just a bit expensdive though</li>
    <li> Awesome. Sharp and precise. Very high quality build</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that my nail clippings aren&#x27;t supposed to fly all over the room when I cut them.  I bought these, and they no longer do!  Awesome.</li>
    <li> typical of other fine Japanese made nail clippers. Sharp and sturdy. Well worth the money as this clipper will last you a long long time.</li>
    <li> Great nail clippers, the best I have ever purchased.  They cut very easily.  No cons.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure able spending so much for clipper, but they really are a step above the cheap ones. They are sharp, so the cuts are clean. The file is built into the lever and of much better quality than the separate file beneath the lever typical of over the clippers.</li>
    <li> These cut very well compared to drug store nail clippers. The only thing I do not like is, they rust. They came in contact with a small amount of water on my bath vanity and rusted in spots. I also like to clean my clippers and found when doing so they got little rust spots even when drying.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome. I was hesitant to pay over $10 on a pair of nail clippers but these suckers are well-constructed and sharp. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Reliable product, great material!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Saw article in the Guardian suggesting that this was the best nail cutter you could purchase and it is.</li>
    <li> Excellent build quality, much better than those you often find at retail stores. Recommended.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. Makes nail trimming effortless.</li>
    <li> You will never buy a pharmacy nail clipper again. ever. This thing should be $25.</li>
    <li> Clip. Clip. Great clipper.</li>
    <li> Never thought of researching nail clippers before, but I guess that&#x27;s what the internet is for. Also never thought I&#x27;d pay more than $10 for nail clippers. And so I have done a disservice to myself all these years, because these clippers are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;They are comfortable to hold and sturdy. The cut is so clean I do not have to file away the ragged edges, and no nails go flying. I can use these clippers on my toenails too, something my regular nail clippers failed at. Men might require the larger 8cm though.&lt;br /&gt;Stocking stuffers for my whole family.</li>
    <li> Nails much healthier with this rather than nail file.</li>
    <li> Great compact little clipper with a plastic cover to hold clippings. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Products arrived quickly and were packaged well.  They are by far the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Amazingly sharp and the texture provides extra grip.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I thought it was hilarious that there&#x27;s even such thing as 5-star fingernail clippers. Guess what, these are 5-star fingernail clippers. Never knew what I was missing.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. I should have bought one of these a long time ago. It&#x27;s a little bit small for big toes, though.</li>
    <li> What was described is true. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Wow, sharpest nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> They clip my nails. Satisfying click. Nice nail collector. Took ~2 weeks to receive from Japan and there was candy inside.</li>
    <li> The best finger nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have Tweezerman clippers and these seem much better.  I would recommend to anyone looking for nice clippers that cut your nails instead of breaking them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a good clipper.  About as good as my much less expensive Revlon clipper when it was new.  Perhaps it&#x27;s from Japan, because it says so on the wrapper, but it&#x27;s not stamped on the clipper, and it lacks the thoughtful packaging and finish I&#x27;ve come to expect of Japanese products of all kinds.  As another reviewer stated, it probably won&#x27;t be a life-changing purchase, for better or worse, unless you accidentally swallow it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, sharp and and doesn&#x27;t leave rough edges at all.</li>
    <li> Super sharp and effective.</li>
    <li> Probably the best cutting small clippers I&#x27;ve used, would buy again. Pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Finally decided to splurge on &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; nail clippers. Wow! Why did I wait so long. Made in Japan!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bend the nail nearly as much as cheap drug store clippers, and the plastic case does a great job of catching clippings. Wish they weren&#x27;t so ugly though.</li>
    <li> You will not be able to fnd any better nail clipper.</li>
    <li> The best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned. If you&#x27;ve always felt that nail clippers were way too big, this is the clipper for you. Pick up a couple spares and keep them handy. There are few things worse than needing to clip a nail or cuticle and not have a clipper nearby.</li>
    <li> These clippers provide a pretty clean cut of the nail but I had an issue with the plastic nail clipping catcher. It is in the way at the edges of the blades such that you can&#x27;t get to the corners of your nails easily. I ended up removing the plastic catcher and throwing it away. The clippers are pretty decent without the catcher installed but aren&#x27;t life changing. Not sure I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> You have no idea how bad your &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; nail clipper is until you use this.  You can&#x27;t afford a Rolls Royce but can afford the Rolls Royce of nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Nice sharp cut.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just received it. It has heft for a small clipper. Amazingly, it works on my toes just as well on fingernails. I have pretty thick toenails so I thought I would have to buy the larger 8 inch one. Really a wonderful clipper.</li>
