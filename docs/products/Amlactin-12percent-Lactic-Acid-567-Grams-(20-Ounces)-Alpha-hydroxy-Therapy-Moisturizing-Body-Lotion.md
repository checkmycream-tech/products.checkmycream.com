      <li>Great lotion.&lt;br /&gt;There are some other uses for the lotion, like getting rid of acne in certain</li>

      <li>This is the best skin lotion over the counter to buy it is very expensive and my skin doctor told me to buy it</li>
      <li>My skin is always SO soft and smooth that I get constant compliments.</li>
      <li>So far I really have noticed a difference with my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin looks normal now even in the winter.</li>
      <li>Some lactic acid products I have used in the past have had a strong medicine smell, but this was essentially odor free.</li>
      <li>Love,  recently had noticed bumps , dry and itchy areas of skin.  </li>
      <li>Skins feels brand new.</li>
      <li>I need all the help I can get, as I live in FL</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all, and takes a little extra &amp;#34;rubbing in&amp;#34; and time so your clothes don&#x27;t stick to you, but if you put it on under your pjs at night, you wake up so smooth!</li>
      <li>so far nothing visual to really see.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy either.</li>
      <li>The cream seems to really help the buffing process but is not enough without doing so.  </li>
      <li>I actually keep it as a secret from most people and let them think my skin is naturally fabulous; I only share the secret of Amlactin with people I love haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not thick at all, it is light and a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>And after a few days skin smooth, not dry and itchy.  </li>
      <li>For me, it does take a few days of application to achieve full benefits of this type of lotion.</li>
      <li>It really helps with their dry skin.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended this lotion for dry, scaly skin and it really works.</li>
      <li>For me it just confirms that a reaction is taking place that really works for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I read online reviews and tried a few products that were available at local store without any difference.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am guilty of not taking good care of my feet.  </li>
      <li>Does create different &#x27;feel&#x27; when applied than normal lotions and also creates slight odor when first applied to the skin.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a slight tingling sensation on sensitive spots, but it&#x27;s very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I am obsessed with good skincare products and have extensive experience with all the different kinds of lotions and creams at different price points.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about ten days, and even in that short time, I have had a marked improvement.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old with severe dry skin all my life, tried just about everything even prescription lotions.</li>

    <li> Excellent product for those of us that have Ichtheosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle lasts 6 weeks</li>
    <li> I have horrible skin so I am obsessed with good skincare products and have extensive experience with all the different kinds of lotions and creams at different price points. I can hands-down assure you that for this price, you won&#x27;t find a better lotion! My skin is always SO soft and smooth that I get constant compliments.

    <li> works great no problems</li>
    <li> Really helps my son in reducing the redness and bumps for his keratosis pilaris. Thankful we found an affordable solution as his last prescription was $400 and did nothing to help him.</li>
    <li> this is what it promised to be, love the product.</li>
    <li> I love the feel this lotion gives me after using the Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator. Skins feels brand new. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> My Doctor prescribed this lotion and then it was available over the counter - I think it works great</li>
    <li> Works well on my dry skin</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Clears up body blemishes. Just what I wanted. For those who hate the smell, that&#x27;s the lactic acid. That&#x27;s the good stuff. The odor goes away very quickly.</li>
    <li> My 2 kids use this on a daily basis. It really helps with their dry skin. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> OMG...I have pretty much searched my whole life for something to effectively treat my KP. This works awesome and you only need a little bit to do the job! Super happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for dry skin that I have ever used. This was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Wrinkles on my hand reduced before my eyes on first try</li>
    <li> I got everything I wanted from this product, plus no smell.  Some lactic acid products I have used in the past have had a strong medicine smell, but this was essentially odor free.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion for dry, scaly skin and it really works. I only use it 3 or 4 times a week with good results. The only think I don&#x27;t like is there is no fragrance.</li>
    <li> best stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, been using it for almost 10 years now, worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it . I would like to purchase Lac hydrin next I heard it works even better . ALWAYS a great experience with Amazon . Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> Works well and Amazon had the best deal</li>
    <li> Since I have extremely dry skin (a medical condition) the doctor&#x27;s nurse suggested this product. It is excellent.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping to tighten up skin after having lost 45 pounds.  It seems to have worked to a degree so I am keeping it up.</li>
    <li> Love this. Been using it for years. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> so far nothing visual to really see.  This rating may change as use continues.  I&#x27;m hoping for the best based on the advertising..</li>
    <li> Works better than regular creams on my scaly looking calves :(  because it helps cell turnover. I still need to regularly buff my legs with foot buffs in the bathtub after soaking. The cream seems to really help the buffing process but is not enough without doing so.  I would give it 5 stars except that it has aluminum in it, which is not too good for soaking into your body through your skin!</li>
    <li> Overall, I am guilty of not taking good care of my feet.  After a visit with my physician, he recommended &amp;#34;Amlactin.&amp;#34;  Sometimes it is difficult to purchase (i.e. stores frequently run out of stock) but it is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old with severe dry skin all my life, tried just about everything even prescription lotions. Amlactin is the best product available.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to write as there already are 90+ reviews, but I want to share that this product is amazing. I started using facial moisturizers this year and got dramatic results; so I started looking for the same ingredients for my body (alpha hydroxy acid or AHA; 12% lactic acid, and yes uric acid). This is it, hands down!  And yes, you have for several minutes that urine odor (uric acid), but once you understand that the other acids are removing dead skin, and the AHA is rebuilding new skin - your body will thank you. The results are just not attainable using conventional lanolin and glycerin type lotions.</li>
    <li> I had dry, crepey skin that had patches of severely dry skin near the elbows, as well as outright morphea-like eczema patches. I&#x27;ve been using this for about ten days, and even in that short time, I have had a marked improvement. Both elbows are greatly improved and my hands really look good. The morphea-like patches are almost gone and my skin tone is much more even. The lotion isn&#x27;t thick and a little goes a very long way. There&#x27;s a slight tingling sensation on sensitive spots, but it&#x27;s very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this! I plan on trying the foot cream next.</li>
    <li> i have a skin problem where I need the Alpha-Hydroxy Acid to remove the dead skin.  My skin looks normal now even in the winter.</li>
    <li> Trying to age gracefully. This helps. Nice and light. Not the best smell but hey can&#x27;t have everything</li>
    <li> If you have very dry skin Amiactin is the lotion for you. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> So far I really have noticed a difference with my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it...really smoothes out very dry scaley lookin skin..improves texture and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> great product for dry flaky skin</li>
    <li> Love,  recently had noticed bumps , dry and itchy areas of skin.  I read online reviews and tried a few products that were available at local store without any difference.  The day after I used the Amlactin I was already noticing a difference. And after a few days skin smooth, not dry and itchy.  Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it promises.  Smooth skin!!!</li>
