      <li>It applies and feels nicely, but for some reason, this product did not jive well with my combination skin.</li>

      <li>I am 39 fair very fair freckled skin, am concerned about aging but still struggle with acne, particularly cystic acne around my mouth and chin area, the kind that take over your face and makes it hurt to talk.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend and I love my skin again!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, honestly I haven&#x27;t seen any difference on my face.</li>
      <li>It feels good on my skin and smells good but with the use of the proactiv+ 3 step I can&#x27;t really tell if it is making any additional benefit.</li>
      <li>This happens with a  lot of skin and hair care products, they are great at first</li>
      <li>love this probuct.</li>
      <li>MORE EVEN TONED.</li>

      <li>are a better deal than the Pro-Activ kiosks.</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t many products that can do that.  </li>

      <li>I have a combination skin pron to acne, I&#x27;ve used it almost every night for more than 6 months.</li>
      <li>Anyway, while buying more of the Refining Mask, I decided to try this Night Cream, and...</li>
      <li>(I was worried since the price was cheap!).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so great, and now, it&#x27;s so affordable to buy on Amazon separately from the whole Proactiv set.</li>
      <li>I love this night cream.</li>
      <li>I use most of their products and love them.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it takes more time.</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>I discovered this night cream several years ago, and it&#x27;s the best!  </li>
      <li>I decided to give this one a try after reading some reviews and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love all Proactiv  products.  </li>

      <li>I started using tea tree oil in my toner and that has helped the most.</li>
      <li>This is a very large bottle &amp; it smells really good too.</li>
      <li>This night cream soaks in beautifully making my skin so soft, even toned and it keeps my breakouts under control!</li>
      <li>and most of my skin is nice and clarified I love how quick it works and</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and am happy to report that, after more than a month of use, this solution has not caused any adverse reactions and works well as a night cream.</li>
      <li>The oilly then dry water makes my used to be flawless skin turn into a land-mine!</li>
      <li>I figured it was worth a shot buying from here, and I am so glad that I did!</li>
      <li>WOW this is great stuff.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m happy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well, it was not a pack of 3... But the product itself works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. It smells nice and works well for me. And the price was great. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! First of all it has a really great scent (like fresh cut green apples), and you only need to use less than a dime sized amount, a little goes a long way. I am in my 40&#x27;s and trying to combat hormonal acne breakouts as well as fine lines. I have been using this along with the 3-step system for 3 weeks now. All the acne in my forehead and chin area has completely cleared up, my skin is a lot softer and smoother and my old acne scars are fading as well, and the fine lines are a lot less prominent. The best part is I hardly use concealer anymore, and I can wear less makeup. These products really work well, and cost a lot less than other products I&#x27;ve used in the past. You do however have to be committed to your skin regime daily to achieve positive results.</li>
    <li> Works great for what promises, clean the face of horrible pimples and blackheads. So good</li>
    <li> Good price at amazon!  Have been using this for about three months-and wake up with refreshed skin! Not oily or dry!  Really balances out the PH and problem areas. Does not sting eyes-and-does not stain sheets or pillow case like other proactive products have been known to do. Texture has greatly improved as well.  Though not as impressed as I was told i would be. Maybe it takes more time. Reasonable pricing here for what you do get though!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect night cream for acne prone skin. I have bought so many types of expensive night cream for my aging skin but all of them would make my skin break out. This is perfect. It goes on so light and I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore about my skin breaking out with this cream. I will not waste my money on anyother night creams after using this. I will definiately keep it in stock. The price is great too. I just love how it makes my skin feel so soft the next day and how lightly it goes on unlike those heavy creams. I have been waiting for something like this and now I have found it and will not buy anything else. I very highly recommend it !!</li>
    <li> this product is great ir works completely an has help the problem that i tried to get rid of for months using other products i mean i normally get blemishes once every year in the same place on sides of face but this product help so much thanks proactive.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time fan of the Proactiv products, worth the price, first product that does what it states that it do in the amount of time.</li>
    <li> It is working so far -- it&#x27;s not overly drying my skin, controlling break-outs, and moisturizing at the same time.</li>
    <li> I started seeing a difference in my acne within 2 weeks of using this product.  I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since then.  I&#x27;m even thinking of ordering more proactive like the blackhead dissolving cream</li>
    <li> When I got this it didn&#x27;t really seem like it was new. Either way it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin.</li>
    <li> Worked like it was supposed to. Smelled to high heaven of an intolerable perfume. I couldn&#x27;t stand to be around my own face. However, i don&#x27;t hate it because it got me on track for looking for retin a which cured my cystic acne in five short weeks. Now i use the dermaroller and DHC&#x27;s vit C and aura cacia&#x27;s lavender oil to cure the scars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for 17 years.  Now that I&#x27;m 33 and worried about dry skin and wrinkles, this product does a great job of moisturizing my skin overnight and helping clear my skin at the same time.  There aren&#x27;t many products that can do that.  I also have very sensitive skin and the salicylic acid is not irritating to my skin at all (unless I use a face wash that&#x27;s irritating).  This product is a staple in my night time skin routine.</li>
    <li> This really is a wonderful product!  I use most of their products and love them.  It actually works and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to a well water home which is very harsh on my already senstive skin. The oilly then dry water makes my used to be flawless skin turn into a land-mine! I hated it, and with being 23 I still wanted to have beautiful skin since I never had a problem before. I have used the 3 step process and have seen such a notice! I use the Night cream with the #3 solution and it helps prevent the breakouts as well as keep the redness down! Deinfitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I discovered this night cream several years ago, and it&#x27;s the best!  I will never change! I have combination skin and live close to the ocean so it&#x27;s very humid here most all year long and using this night cream doesn&#x27;t make my skin too oily during the day like so many other night creams I have tried in the past.  Other night creams were so thick that they would make my skin oily during the day even though I wash my face every morning.  This night cream soaks in beautifully making my skin so soft, even toned and it keeps my breakouts under control! I&#x27;m 47 years old and everyone thinks I&#x27;m 35! I recommend this night cream to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 and I have acne from stress and hormones. Just began for me. I always looked at those commercials and thought never for me. Boy was I wrong. I use this almost every night and my skin is pimple free, and if I stop I will get pimples again. Scary</li>
    <li> This cleans up my skin in a matter of a week, It also reduce a litle winky I had on my neck.  If you are over 30 and you still have break outs this is for you,</li>
    <li> Doesnt work for me..  I recommend proactive stuff for anyone that has acne but to use it for 3 months maximum so it cleans your face and then stop using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited for over a week in order to submit a feedback.Even if I do not have acne there still are some greasy spots out there and my skin is not quite porcelain.After I used it every night for a week and a half almost, I noticed the structure has improved a bit, is more bright but I can&#x27;t say that is a miracle cream though.I still have to use some face masks for my face.It is a good cream but do not expect miracles.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin pron to acne, I&#x27;ve used it almost every night for more than 6 months. I can say it brightens and clarifies my skin a little but hasn&#x27;t any effects on pores, redness and acne of my face that I can recognize.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to try other products next time.</li>
    <li> Beware this isn&#x27;t a jumbo sized tube as stated.  And it isn&#x27;t the clarifying night cream.  They sent a 1 oz clarifying night LOTION.  I wonder how many times this happens and customers don&#x27;t feel like shipping back?&lt;br /&gt;UNHAPPY!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!  What more can I say about it! I would definitely buy this again if I ever need to.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT HAS HELPED ME WITH PORES AND  BREAK OUTS.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO MY FRINDS. I WILL BE  ORDERING AGAIN</li>
    <li> Like the consistency and is very moisturizing for an acne treating product. I just don&#x27;t think it clears up breakouts as fast as the claim. That being said ill definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I PUT THIS CREAM ON NIGHTLY AND HAVE NOTICED MY SKIN TO BE CLEARER AND MORE EVEN TONED. THE SMELL IS VERY REFRESHING AND THE CREAM IS LIGHTWEIGHT. A WIN WIN!</li>
    <li> This lotion has worked really well to help keep my acne under control and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like some other products. Has a nice scent too!</li>
    <li> I have used these product for years and they work really well on your skin.  I have recommended them often and with great results</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am happy to report that, after more than a month of use, this solution has not caused any adverse reactions and works well as a night cream.</li>
    <li> Discolorations will not disappear over night. Takes time. Have noticed little by little they do lighten until discolorations disappear. Can be used all over face, has pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> It causes dry out a bit but still a good cream for acne face; night time is a good healing time for acne, this cream presume its purpose.</li>
    <li> This product works FAST and wasn&#x27;t harsh on my skin. I&#x27;d recommend it to friends and family! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love all Proactiv  products.  They really do work!  This cream is great for illuminating the skin and making dark spots a lot less visible.  I will use it again.</li>
    <li> Complementary use after the Proactiv step1,2, and 3. Still a very good night cream you can tell the difference at the morning.</li>
    <li> This night cream is as great as I expected. It has a nice texture, smells delicate and neutral and you need only a small amount to cover the whole face. Is it not greasy, it gets very fast in the skin (especially if it is used after the Proactiv pore refining Peel products or the Proactiv sulfur mask). It is hydrating the skin and it helps the pores not to create to much grease during the sleep. Also, is not creating spots on your sheets and pillow, as other acne products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me. I started using tea tree oil in my toner and that has helped the most.</li>
    <li> I have been using proactiv products for years and I love this lotion. The step 3 lotion that comes in the set is ok, but I like this lotion better because I feel like it really moisturizes more with out being too much or greasy at all. I also love the smell of this lotion. The regular size is pretty small so it is nice to also have it in a larger size and lasts longer.</li>
    <li> it looks like the pic and I use it every night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a good production&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it on time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, honestly I haven&#x27;t seen any difference on my face. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months already.</li>
    <li> Like clockwork, this product caused breakouts every time I tried to use it. It applies and feels nicely, but for some reason, this product did not jive well with my combination skin.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. The regular price on the proactiv site is pretty high but its a good deal on amazon. I am 39 fair very fair freckled skin, am concerned about aging but still struggle with acne, particularly cystic acne around my mouth and chin area, the kind that take over your face and makes it hurt to talk. I haven&#x27;t made it back to the dermatologists. I used to have some success with peroxide based products like acne free and pan oxyl but recently they have just made my skin way too raw and suns sensitive, even with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I have had an impressive(knock on wood!) success with keeping cystic acne at bay using this product. My skin is definitely clearer than it has been in a long time and looks brighter and healthier. I am still trying to find a balance between treating and overtreating, I occasionally overdo it using acne face wash at the same time and get some rebound oil/small acne-but nothing like the awful cystic stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I bought this in December I think, and now at the end of March its just starting to run out, even with using it a lot so a bottle went a long way for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is borderline magic!! I don&#x27;t normally experience results overnight, but I did! I&#x27;ve been struggling with stubborn breakouts for SEVERAL months and ended up with either overly dry skin, or massive breakouts across my face. This got me off the roller coaster and I&#x27;m finally seeing the acne clear up while my face retains it moisture :)</li>
    <li> I tried to take a short cut and thought this cream alone could help but I guess I need to go back to the full treatment. It will be a great additive after I have done the repairing lotion.</li>
    <li> I have found that all the proactive products work. It was drying my skin so I only use it couple times a week. I mainly wanted my pores to shrink and it does that.</li>
    <li> This happens with a  lot of skin and hair care products, they are great at first and then they just don&#x27;t do the job they once did. I use it for a while then take breaks and then come back but it&#x27;s never done the same great job as the first few weeks. One other thing, it can ball up on your skin like when a sweater piles, you&#x27;ll have balls of product on your face which I assume means your skin is not absorbing it.</li>
    <li> I have large pores, acne scars and sun spots. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for three weeks twice a day and the improvement of my skin is remarkable. No irritation at all and works great on fine wrinkles too. Excellent product and price. Ships fast.</li>
    <li> Too greasy for me. Actually contributed to my skin troubles.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product and I have been using it for three days so far every night.  The thing I have noticed that it leaves my face really greasy every morning and continue like that during the day. I already have a very oily skin.  I am a 33 year old woman suffering from adult acne/hormonal.  I bought it because I want a product that can help me not only battle my acne and scars but also wrinkles.  I will update this info if I see a change.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne, I get a few small ones ones in a while. Within a week of using this product, huge zits started to appear around my chin area. I stopped using it for about a month, and all I have now are sort of pigmentation of where the breakouts used to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Proactiv products before. This is the only product I used. I get occasional breakouts. I bought it because I wanted to try a product with Retinol, I needed a night cream and I thought the Proactiv brand was a good one. I used the entire tube and never noticed anything different or special. I still had breakouts, pretty much in recurring spots.</li>
    <li> Using this every night seems to help. Proactive seems to work for a little while and stop. But I like this.</li>
    <li> WOW this is great stuff. The first morning after using I noticed a difference to the texture and yes clarity of my skin. I&#x27;ve always had large pores on my face and nothing has ever worked until this product and I&#x27;m 60 years old. Highly recommend this to anyone that has large pores that hard to keep from clogging causing breakouts. Thank you so much Proactiv.</li>
    <li> This Proactive Solution JUMBO Super Size Clarifying Night Cream feels so good on my face.  I have some allergies; but, this does not bother me.  Absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  I have really noticed a reduction in my breakout since using this product.  And it is also non-drying which is great!</li>
    <li> Nice mild apple scent, leaves skin smooth, non-greasy, helped clear up my skin a lot! Great night cream, and formula isn&#x27;t very strong (1% salicylic acid) so skin doesn&#x27;t peel after treatment.</li>
    <li> this is a great cream i love this product too. Has worked to really clear my skin use it every night before bed no complaints</li>
    <li> Great for reducing breakouts.  It simply does not dry out your skin and I use it faithfully every night to prevent breakouts.  You cannot beat the Proactive line for acne.  It is the very best!</li>
    <li> When I think of a Clarifying Night Cream, I think some sort of moisturizer.  This is not that.  It does help with pimples but not moisture.</li>
    <li> I like to use this at night because I know how good salicylic acid and retinol are for acne prone skin. Helps extend the use of the step 3 lotion in my proactiv + kit. Have purchased 3 times now. Will continue to buy. It feels good on my skin and smells good but with the use of the proactiv+ 3 step I can&#x27;t really tell if it is making any additional benefit. Mostly it just makes me feel better I think.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, my skin drinks it in and I wake up with softer skin! I will keep using this! I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice(green apples) and smell is not to strong. It is a very light cream compare to other night creams. My skin so far likes it.</li>
    <li> It feels so soft in your face.Like you we&#x27;re refresh in the morning when you wake up,coz the pores in your skin becomes toner.Looks young looking skin,as long as you put this daily and you will see the result.</li>
    <li> I am 58 and still have acne.  This product along with other Proactiv is great</li>
    <li> this is good for keeping my skin clear; i am 58 and yes, still break out; plus i have wrinkles too, so this seems to be good for both issues; Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Proactiv always works great for those stubborn pimples. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. It definitely works.</li>
    <li> How good do you feel when you&#x27;re dermatologist comments on the great condition of your skin.  I&#x27;ve been using Proactive now for approximately 5 years; not because of any acne or pimple problem but because I have areas on my face that are extremely dry (corners around my nose &amp; forehead) and areas that are oily (nose and around my mouth/lips).  I needed a moisturizer that could address both issues and remedy the dry &amp; oiliness.  Well, Proactiv did it.  I just by chance saw a commercial and decided to try Proactiv because I&#x27;ve used so many very expensive moisturizers.  Needless to say it works and I&#x27;m a Proactiv girl.....</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I tried the refining mask, but as soon as I opened the package, the tube where it comes looked weird and as if it wasn&#x27;t original, it also smelled like hair conditioner. I am not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am 52 years old, have had acne prone skin since I was 13 years old,and have used the three step Proactiv system for about fifteen years.  It has worked for me.  As I approached my forties and had acne and wrinkles to deal with, I decided to add the clarifying night cream to my night time regimen.  So glad I did, since using it once a day at night has given me softer, younger looking skin with no breakouts.  I &#x27;m not sure of the amount of retinol in this product, but I&#x27;ve been told I look ten years younger.  Hey, at my age I&#x27;ll take anything I can get!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about whether proactiv being sold on Amazon would be authentic... But I was tired of my order not going through on the proactiv website, and I was almost out of this product and needed it now....I figured it was worth a shot buying from here, and I am so glad that I did! From now on,</li>
    <li> I should start by saying I have had horrendous acne my entire life, and it&#x27;s such a bummer. I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Proactiv, and it just wasn&#x27;t enough to stay with, considering the expense and extensive routine and just how damaging the stuff all way in drying out skin and bleaching towels and pillowcases. I&#x27;ve since had better luck by switching to Clearogen, mainly for the face wash and night treatments, and using drugstore brands for non-comedogenic moisturizers with spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, I left Proactiv, but could not live without Proactiv Solution Refining Mask. It&#x27;s so great, and now, it&#x27;s so affordable to buy on Amazon separately from the whole Proactiv set. Anyway, while buying more of the Refining Mask, I decided to try this Night Cream, and...it was lame. The scent is bizarre and quite strong (but take that with a grain of salt, because I have a very sensitive nose). Personally, I couldn&#x27;t wear this on my face, even not around my nose, because of the smell. I tried to use this for a while and got some cystic acne from it, so overall, not worth it, in my opinion. But you should definitely try the Sulfur Refining Mask.</li>
    <li> Great list of ingredients. Including BHA at 1% and Retinol. The only product to contain those 2 ingredients. Salicylic Acid at 1% at proper PH will work as an exfoliant and retinol is the usual anti-aging superstar. No franrance bu smells somehow franranced. But a nice odor. Recommended..</li>
    <li> This is a very large bottle &amp; it smells really good too. I have been using it at night &amp; even in the mornings</li>
    <li> I was looking for a workable night cream, plus this one clarifies my skin at the same time.  Excellent choice</li>
    <li> No matter what condition my skin feels like, when I use the night cream my face feels rejuvenated the next morning and problem areas are less of a problem.  I have used some pretty expensive products, but is by far one of the best.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this clarifying night cream....smells like green apples! I did not have an acne problem when I started to use the product. However, some of the marks I did have from my younger years did vanish. So yes, I would say this product is effective.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
    <li> love this probuct. use it nightly and it really helps clarify the skin without over drying. always happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is 1% Salicylic Acid. It is less than I&#x27;d like but it is okay in doing what I need it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order didn&#x27;t come in 1 &amp;#34;JUMBO&amp;#34; size but in 3 small 1 oz tubes which is great cause at least I got .5 oz more than I would&#x27;ve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expiration dates on the tubes are for 2016 so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to think about returning expired product (I was worried since the price was cheap!).</li>
    <li> Whether or not a skincare product works depends completely on the individual. Some have posted that this product is ineffectual, and that may be true for them, but it is not true for me. The Clarifying Night Cream has radically changed the texture of my skin in only a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works well for me because I am in my forties and my skin has been damaged by sun more than the skin of someone younger. If you are in your forties with brown hair and skin that tans easily, this may help you.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use this only at night - don&#x27;t wear it outside in sunlight because it really makes your skin sun sensitive.</li>
    <li> YES YES YES!  I pair it with the clear purifying mask and my skin is glowing !!!!  I keep this is stock!!!  Wooo-hooo!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t want a monthly commitment with Proactiv company. Kiosks in the malls can be pricey. Finding these products on Amazon was a great discovery!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard such great things about Proactiv so figured I would give it a try since my previous acne night cream has been discontinued.  Its a good product, it did help, but it did not totally keep blemishes at bay (it was the only thing changed in my regime that was working prior to the switch) and did not get my skin all that soft.  I found it to be middle of the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, all the ingredients are not always listed in the listings so if they aren&#x27;t here please note that this product contains chamomile in it.  If you have allergies like me, that&#x27;s important to know.  I did notice a slight reddening in my skin that I&#x27;m guessing is from the chamomile since I am allergic to that plant.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Works great. I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Only use on problem areas so it lasts forever. Will definelty purchase again.</li>
    <li> I got allergies immediately after putting it on my face. This has never happened before with any other face cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old with acne prone skin.  I had used this product years ago and loved but its wasn&#x27;t cheap buying it direct from proactiv. Been using it the last few days and so far I like it. My skin is nice and smooth, my large nose pores appear nice and small and the small bumps on my forehead are clearing up. So far I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always very skeptical about trying new acne products. I decided to give this one a try after reading some reviews and I absolutely love it. I noticed my skin was clearer and brighter after just a few nights of use! It&#x27;s very lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s clogging my pores like some other lotions and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this with the three step proactiv product and I absolutely love it!! I&#x27;m 33 years old and have been using just the three step solution and it worked ok but I wanted to add something that would moisturize my skin and help with the breakouts. I can never use any kind of lotion because it causes my skin to break out and I was a little skeptical, but after using this stuff, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  If I go to bed and notice a couple break outs starting to appear, the next morning they are always gone. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and am always surprised when I wake up in the morning. I highly recommend and I love my skin again!!!! Oh and I also use less makeup, which is saving me money :)</li>
    <li> Just as described, good product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> All came new. Expires 2016. I&#x27;m very happy with it all.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has no SPF, which is AWESOME!  SPF makes my face breakout.  It is light, fresh and soaks in right away.  It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any greasy feeling yet quenches your skin.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I recommend it to everyone and the big size bottles you can find on Amazon are a better deal than the Pro-Activ kiosks.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because I have adult acne. It&#x27;s full of decent ingredients and says it will help clear skin over night. Although it did start to clear my skin, it also started to greatly dry it out. And since I was waking to dry, flaky spots I couldn&#x27;t continue to use this product. I wish they made a face lotion for night that wasn&#x27;t so darn strong. I don&#x27;t consider my skin to even be &#x27;sensitive&#x27; but this product was just too much.</li>
    <li> im a first time user, so far its good.its works with other proactiv products, its better to use it daily than you can see the results .</li>
    <li> Most of these types of creams just clog up my pores and make my face break out! Thankfully this Clarifying Night Cream is made by Proactiv and doesn&#x27;t follow suit with the rest of those types of creams. Overall I am pretty satisfied with this product and will continue to use it until I find something better.</li>
    <li> I put this on every night before I go to bed and wake up and most of my skin is nice and clarified I love how quick it works and how nicely it goes on my face very happy!</li>
